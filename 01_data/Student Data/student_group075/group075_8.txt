First time visiting this shop and will definitely be back.  We were impressed with the products here as well as the knowledge and helpfulness that was shared with us.  Felt like we didn't have to guess which product was best for our pet because we were provided with helpful information so we could make the best decision for our pet. Our boxer puppy was very happy with our choices.< /review>

<review>This shop is perfect for those who want to offer more natural foods to their pets. They also carry unique treats and accessories.

Also, they have some hard to find brands that you will not find at Petco, Pet Smart, or Pet Club.

Unfortunately, they do not have live pets, but that is not their speciality.

The staff member is really welcoming and inviting. He asked what pets I had and was generally interested. Definitely acknowledged me when I entered.<//review><resp>{'time': 1618244326820, 'text': 'We are so glad that you came in, thank you so much.\nWe hope that we were helpful.'}< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Are you unsure what your pet needs and want to give them their best? Go here. I may sound like a shill. But I really can't express how awesome their service and knowledge is. Also, their pricing is better than anywhere else. Just the cherry on the top.<//Review>

Fantastic little shop for all of your furbaby’s needs.  My sister sent me here (completely out of my way) as she felt so strongly about supporting this small business.

They are very friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about animals.  I don’t feed commercial dog food as I work with a Vet Nutritionist for my baby’s needs.  I will say, if I were to feed a commercial diet, this place would definitely be for me.  They actually put thought and research into the products they offer.  They advocate for the best, appropriate diets for our beloved family members.  They only carry products that are of the finest quality and very much above the status quo.

They also offer in house Doggy Daycare.  I can tell you that I don’t trust ANYBODY with my baby but I would trust this place if I had a need for doggy day care.

If you’re looking for a place that is locally owned and actually cares about your baby’s nutrition this is the place to shop.  I cannot recommend this place enough as I was thoroughly impressed.

Very cute inside and plenty of parking outside.  Please support places like this as they are truly a rare gem.<//Text>

<Review>Extremely helpful, knowledgeable and caring people in this store. Joe took a lot of time with us to discuss things that may help us with our Frenchie who suffers from an aggressive K9 lymphoma. When the vets throw up their hands or they only offer solutions that cost more than a new car, it's time to do your own research. So many great natural products here to help with what seems like any issues your pet might be facing. Even if you just want to feed them better food, this place is your one stop shop.</Review>< pics>

This pet store seemed really sketchy while I pulling up but all I can say is wow. We went in looking for some cbd treats for our pups since we are taking them on a really long road trip. Not only did the worker explain every treat thoroughly but, he gave us a little baggy full of treats since it was our first time in! Best customer service ever!< /Text>

I saved over 10 bucks on 1 bag of dog food from the next cheapest Option. The staff is great and really know their business. They also carry a selection of small packages of trial size pet foods so you don't have to spend a ton of money just to find out your picky Shiba Inu will not eat it!

<review>This is my favorite pet store in Vacaville and I'm so glad it's open. They have CBD treats and are working on getting some CBD oil and I wish they had been open when my older dog was still alive as I had to go to Davis or Berkeley to get his CBD treats. But that's not the only reason to love them. My 19-year-old cat has hyperthyroidism and was getting pickier and pickier on the food he ate and could keep down. I did some research online and found that Weruva had the proper protein ratio that he needed, and the only place to find that within 10 miles was the Pet Shop in Vacaville (unless I wanted to go to Davis). I went there to get the Weruva but with the help of the awesome workers, I also got some samples to see if my cat could eat anything else. My cat loves the Weruva and except for chicken in a can, it's the only other thing that doesn't make him throw up. He also ate some of the dry food from the sample (the first time in years he touched dry food) and loved it. Also, when I was trying to get the Weruva initially most of the food had fish in it and because of his illness we were trying to veer away from too much fish, and they didn't have the higher end Weruva brand I had wanted but I asked them and the next time I came they had ordered tons of the other stuff and had more options which was great.

What surprised me the most was how affordable everything was. When I was buying his pet food elsewhere it always cost so much to get the high protein food, but here I'm surprised everytime how affordable it is. They really do try to make it so everyone can get it. I also switched my new puppy to the Orijen dog food at first and then the Acana, as Orijen was too protein rich for him on the days he wasn't running around the dog park for 2 hours. They had recommended the Acana at first because he was just a puppy and because all their food is high protein and have good protein sources in them but I wanted to try the Orijen. The Acana has been great regardless of his energy levels and is a great balance for my golden retriever so I switched to the bigger bag. My puppy also loves going in there. He goes straight to the door and starts going for the raw bar. He loves the raw pig ears and duck neck, He loves freeze dried heart treats and the people.

Definitely, the best place in the city to go for high quality, affordable cat food, and dog food. They only sell the good stuff. They even sell raw meat patties and other raw food in their fridge.They had slip leashes for a cheap and they have sports branded collars for your dog, affordable. Basically, anything you want they have and it's affordable and close. Also, if they don't have something you want they're willing to look into getting it, as they only sell from quality dog food companies for a great price.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1508187653770, 'text': "Wow Tabitha, we are blown away by your review!

Great place, knowledgeable and caring staff, and a clean well kept facility. Have been to several vets in the past and by far, this is one of the best. Used to be a very SOLID 5 star rating. Lately, it seems way understaffed, check-in's are longer, and service/check-out wait times have almost tripled. Scheduled appointment for one shot and was told our dog would receive it from vet tech and we would be in and out. When we arrived, we were told it would be a minimum 2hrs because vet tech was assisting the only doctor with 4 surgeries. Front desk checked with on site vet tech and confirmed 2 hour time frame. Well just now tried to check on status after waiting 5 hours and no one answers the phone. I really like Banfield and hope this is just a one time issue.<//Review>

< Review>
Super under staffed and over booked.
Never book anything on Sunday or the weekend in general.
I will be moving to a different banfield from now on. Or just canceling my wellness plan altogether.
They are not a discount vet, you can get better personal service from any other vet.
They do standard procedures for your pets and don't read over their individual conditions. The vet tech or doctor was supposed to call to discuss treatment, but after 2 hours I called and the vet tech said they already did tests that I never agreed on and are charging me for me. And he was out of breath and stuttering a little. They are overwhelmed. They need a bigger facility or more staff.
1st time I had issues was when they asked me to drop off my 13 year old Addisonian dog in first thing in the morning... and after all day of her sitting in a cage, no one had even seen her when I called at 5pm later that day. That should've been the red flag that stopped me but they promised that it wouldn't happen again. Now I sit in my car waiting for over 2 hours for a shot that takes literally 10 minutes anywhere else.

I would not recommend.

Had 6 clients in the lobby when the sign says limited to 2.</Review>

Super friendly and helpful staff. I called during an emergency with my dog and they stayed calm with me on the phone, had me bring my dog in ASAP and gave her amazing care. Ashley and Phil provided excellent customer service and Dr. V was incredible with her patience, explained everything clearly and thoroughly, answered all of my questions and really took the time to provide top notch medical care for my dog. I will definitely be going back to this Banfield.</Review>

Horrible! Lost my appointment twice, told me I had to do a blood test the Mon. before neutering my pup,  they never did the test, instead looked for other ways to charge me for things I was not ther for, quoted me $300 to $400 dollars and when I got ther the price changed to $465, and told me I had to pay $303 for chest x-rays because my pet was on a non grain diet. I will never do businness with them and will tell everyone about my experience.</review>

The staff here is absolutely amazing. They are always so friendly and patient with everyone. Phone ringing off the hook but they always get to you in a timely manner. Dr. Nguyen is very caring and supportive. Annaylece Brockham especially was fantastic with Stella. I rested easy knowing she was in good hands.< /review>

Took my fur baby here for a much needed auditory check. From the hood busting the fireworks, and all the fires too, the schmitz  caused a nasty ear infection. Worth every penny spent including medicine.< /review>

My biggest pet peeve is veterinary hospitals making you feel guilty for not buying expensive & unnecessary treatments, meds, & products. I didn't feel that way here & my normally fearful little girl came out from the back happy as could be!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I took my dog in as an emergency , there was so much going on and I was hoping for better answers I ended up having to get a second opinion because the results I got where wrong. If they would have diagnosed her right there could have been a fighting chance and now I have to pay everything because she is deceased. My heart is broken and this company doesn’t care about you or your pets they are just money hungry.< /Review>

Dr Neuyen and staff are amazing! Our Sammy Girl was 13 1/2 yrs old we loved her so much. Dr Neuyen never met Sammy before that day she was amazing ,she guided our family through the whole process. We were all a mess. Not only did she comfort Sammy but the whole Family. I've never seen a team with so much compassion and love ...I'd actually give them 10 🌟 's.<//text>

<Review>My first experience was whem my dog had a terrible life threatening ear infection. I had taken her to several vets and none of medication they gave her was helping. She was miserable. I went to pet smart to get some advice and there was a Banfield Pet hospital in the building. Once the medical assistant took one look at her ear she immediately called for a doctor. To make a long story short Lady was treated and has not had an infection since. Now that they are in Laverne it's even better. Dr. Harvey and the entire staff are the real deal. Top notch.  They treat your animal as if it were there own. AND they make great coffee!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I used to get my hair cuts at Cali Kuts 2 years ago. They have really dropped down their standards since then. It is clear to see that the barbers there lack professionalism and timeliness. Once I finally got on a chair, the barber rushed through the cut and did a poor job. As nice as their chairs and ring lights are, it does not make up for the poor quality of job done. If you want a clean fade, do not come here.</review>< Date>

<text>By far one of the best if not the best shop in town from management down to the barbers. The Staff is always willing to go above and beyond for the clients. This barbershop is very clean. The TVs are a plus during games. You pay what you get for, the haircuts along with the service are worth every dollar.</text>< Pictures>

Loving the new location of the shop! Hands down best barbers 💈 they really make sure you look flawless before walking out it’s like a new you! I wouldn’t trust ANYONE else to cut my hair! The one in the 1st chair Sammy is hilarious and will definitely make you laugh. The one in the middle Edgar is probably the sexiest barber I have ever seen and I’m a lesbian lmao. And the last one Eric the  best Barber that has ever picked up a pair of clippers! Don’t waste your money on any other shop come show these guys some love ❤️<//text>

Great place to get a hair cut. Been coming here for years, and will be coming back time and time again. Very long wait at times but its definitely worth it. Give a call before hand to book a time is my best advice.< /text>

I will say they do a great job cutting hair. But if your blonde hair and blue eyes (white)  I wouldn't go here because you will be a last priority. They are worth the 20$ for a haircut but not the 40$ they charge for just an appointment 👎👎< /Review>

Great haircuts but they talk too much. You will spend a very long time here waiting to get a cut and waiting for your cut to finish. They stop multiple times while they are giving you a haircut. You will spend 1 hour to 1 hour 30min on the chair getting your hair cut when it should only take 30-40min. Very unprofessional barbers.
When you get there, they will always tell you it will be a 2 hour wait.</text>

The barbers at Kali Cutz can cut hair really great but they don't understand what it means to be professional. I had a guy literally take a break from cutting my hair to go into the break room, stay there for 10 minutes, come back with pizza in his hand and finish cutting my hair. Sometimes he would go outside to see the other barber's cars and or just get up and leave.</review>

<review>This place should have an Adult Males Only sign on the door.  The barber gave my son a good hair cut and was respectful but as far as some of the other barbers in there, the language gets out of hand with jabs between the other barbers and at times customers, the televisions are set to movies that at times have strong language and adult content.  Its more like a guys locker room with no coach telling the guys to cool their language.  This is not a place for kids or ladies.< /review>< Resp>

<text>The hair cuts are good, but not worth putting up with the service, wait time is an hour because the barber's can't just get the job done . They're constantly talking with eachother and sometimes the most inappropriate things can't even bring children in there without them hearing something they shouldn't . Some workers even pick up the phone and start having fullconversations with friends on the phone . Update:so I waited 2 hours just so they could mess up on my hair cut..Service has gone from 100 to 0 in the past couple of years.< /text>< GmapID>

Did not want to cut my hair after having me wait apparently because they wanted to be done early while they still had hour and a half before closing time. Very professional.</review>

AMAZING PLACE! 10$ Fill-a-bags and new selections every week of high quality fashion brands and vintage clothes together! Star employee Martín is the best host they have there and he goes the extra mile for The City and their customers ☀️😁👋 I get all my clothes there right now so here are some pics of some of the items I paired together. 🤠🥂😸💓</Review>

great experience everyone was so nice and welcoming! they have a great $10 bag sale where you can fit so much in a bag and just put pay $10 plus tax. When you buy extra clothes out of the $10 you get 30% off. The people are super fun and i got some great stuff for $30 in all. Go check it out they have all kinds of different stuff to choose from< /Text>

<Review>Love The City Thrift Storage has a better collection of vinyls and other vintage items than your average thrift store. Aside from their vintage collection, they also sell kitchenware appliances , furniture and clothes. Very friendly staff, would definitely recommend checking this place out if you’re a thrift junky like I am and are interested in adding to your vinyl collection.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJmdlOSg13wCYvE4xv_HTX6AJlbFGbocEphg3E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQgGRoP3Q-l2Alkq48CM_uwNkqBvHgYx8JFo4V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg-88g4DjdZ7YDLg1UjQ3eawM0adOT4Jvhp1H5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

So sorry you haven’t been able to make it, some apps seem to have had trouble keeping up with our current hours due to Covid and it’s definitely unfortunate :( We are open 12-5 Tues-Sat currently and starting next week will be open to 6. Hoping to add more hours as we work things out with the current situation but appreciate your understanding in the time and hope you make it down soon! See you then :) Emma and the LTC Crew\nWhen in doubt please feel free to check our website: https://www.ltcthriftstoreinfo.com/'}<//Response>

The workers here are really friendly and helpful.  Also the prices here cannot be beat! I'd say about half of my clothes are from here and still in great condition.  The $10 bag deal is the best deal I've ever found in Los Angeles< /Review>

This is a solid, local place!! I went there for kids books and they had a great selection. Walked out with 24 books for only $12! Whoever was running the register was incredibly friendly and helpful. It's a small store, I heard him go above and beyond to help several customers in the 30 minutes I was there. I would definitely recommend trying this place out.<//Review>

If you love to dig through Stuff to find the treasure then this is your spot! I come here to buy glass vases for flowers. They have a lot of glassware and clothing plus a miscellaneous household things, books, children's things and some electronics.

It's not high end but I donate some good stuff so maybe once in awhile, LOL,. You will do some digging but I'm sure there's treasure to be found.<//Text>

Abundant and eclectic items, in fast rotation, and super friendly staff--oh, and good sales weekly. I plan to make this store a habit! (And if you walk about a block, parking is free.)<//review>

Like I don't already have enough books, but I was going out to dinner and I needed something to read.

Even though they were having a 30% off sale on the furniture, there was nothing there I wanted. Also they charge tax if they are nonprofit why do they charge tax?<//text>< Pics>

<review>What a cute little thrift store. The store is not huge but they have a wide variety of items. They also do a special where anything off their normal racks (on the left side of the store as you come in from the street) that fits in a paper grocery bag costs $10. Friendly staff. Parking on the street or in back. I found several things and left having only spent $7.< /review>< rate>

I pride myself on knowing all the amazing thrift store to get deals, some how this place excaped me! There are some great vintage finds from: clothing, furniture to fantastic glass's and dishes to choose from.
If you are looking for the unique and at a good price (so many thrifts are just over pricing their stuff today) this is the place to shop.
Put it on your list of go to spots!<//text>

Small and kinda over priced atleast for the furniture. I mean $45 for a small shabby  dresser that's missing knobs? They had a decent selection but I didn't find anything I liked. But hey its thrift so inventory is always changing.  I'll go back.</review>

All this little mall is missing is a convenience store. It would be great to be able to get a pint of milk or a loaf of bread without having to drive to the store.</review>

< Review>
I wish Marin Country Mart was the standard of local mall all around the country. The layout of the mall gives the whole location a real “village” type vibe.

There is a great balance of stores, even as some stores have unfortunately gone out of business (like Diesel the bookstore), they were quickly replaced by new stores of the same type (a new bookstore went into the exact same location).

The stores are in general locally owned, boutique type shops - which means the variety of products is more diverse and you can find interesting things here that you cannot find online or at other malls in the local area.

Love love love it.

My only complaint - parking can be a nightmare on the weekends if there are a lot of patrons visiting, which there always are because of how popular it is!<//Review>

Marin Brewery:. Great customer service, great food quality and quantity, and very decently priced, all in all was very pleased with the experience and had a wonderful time with the family on Easter.  Our server was very friendly, and prompt.  The afternoon outside was a great experience in their patio style seating.  Would highly recommend this as must try if you are in the area.   Hope you enjoy.<//Review>

Always happy to visit Larkspur Landing. There aren't too many shops but they're unique. There's a nice centralized play place and a turtle pond for kids to enjoy.< /Review>

Good restaurants, beautiful stores, one of the best terrace in the bay,, great concerts, markets and events. A good place to go with the family.

The only bad thing: the bookstore just closed.
This was one of the best store in this place.< /Text>

One of our favorite chill shopping areas in Marin. Great place to take the kids and hit up food trucks, listen to music, play on the little playground, and look at the fish and turtles in their little fountain<//Text>

Great atmosphere, nice quirky shops with stuff you can't get just anywhere and the restaurants are great.  Bonus, there is often something interesting to experience like live music or the farmer's market. I could go on and on, but hey did I tell you about the food?  It's great!</review>

<Time>1552716700410</Time><Rate>4< /Rate><text>This is one of those special places in Marin to visit. They offer just so many different things here.
Farmer's market on Saturday, Jazz on Fridays, Food truck Sundays.
They have some really nice shops as well as restaurants and are always very busy.

The only concerns I have is that they don't have any bike racks which is odd considering they are connected by a bike path.
They also had a strong human urine smell in the outside elevator last time I rode it.

Otherwise I recommend this place pretty much any day of the year.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80859a438453cc67:0x8095f0ff29cc5ecb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Ok this place is a hidden gem, so I kind of hate to put this review online.  If you are doing a conference in downtown SF, stay here and take the ferry. Avoid all the mess of being in the city but have full access to all the city has to offer, with a short and enjoyable ferry ride.  Also some really good restaurants within easy walking distance of this Marriott. Safe, clean low stress , the bar/ restaurant is more than adequate, we preferred to eat there in the morning before tackling the city. Staff friendly .< /Text>< name>

Awesome little shopping plaza. Quaint or Cozy is the best way to describe it. Being that it is right next to the bay and the port for the ferry, it has that seaside feel as well. The prices are high here, but I'm quite used to that in Larkspur. There are many excellent restaurants here, as well as a few boutiques for shopping. I personally recommend the Campos, for you meat lovers out there!<//text>

Beautiful, but pricey mall. Good eats and nice shopping. They also have events like live jazz, farmers markets and trick or treating.</text>

Mostly high end restaurants and some other type stores. High prices. Especially like The Butcher Shoppe - choose your cut and have them cook it out just buy it and takes it home to cook it yourself.</review>

The worst of the best of Marin. The other shoppers are completely unaware of the existence of fellow people and staff at the store are overly nice in a stepford kinda way.</Text>

Larkspur Landing is an outdoor, high end boutique shopping center. It has lots of great options for lunch and dinner. There are also many clothing and specialty stores. The prices for all are on the high to very high end. It's perfect for the Marinite with too much money and time on their hands to wander through on a weekday.

Key places include Starbucks and the Marin Brewing Company. You will also find a 24 Hour Fitness, Bed Bath & Beyond. Try Three Twin Ice Cream for a treat.

Unique features/services include valet parking occasionally available, a small dog run with grass and baggies provided, and a Farmer's Market on Saturdays 9am-2pm,

For those on a budget there is aTOGOs which is very good and has incredibly fast service.

4 Stars for high prices and inaccessibility to the masses-even in Marin.<//text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) It is an open and nice mall. A farmer's market is also open on Saturdays and weekends, and the fish shops that open there offer a variety of sashimi grades such as salmon, hamachi, tuna, and more.

This place is really slow for truckers having to pickup here. A really good place to run out of hours with no place near to break. FCFS. Been here 4 hours and I still can’t see getting a door any time soon based on what I’ve seen.  Never again.

BTW. All the glowing customer reviews?  It’s obvious they spammed their Google position with their own “positive reviews”.  Poor way to run a business.<//Review>

I was in a supermarket once and came across their Tetsujin frozen udon noodle. I took it home and tried it. Since then it has became my goto meal for a udon fix =)  it has a nice firm texture and just taste better.<//text>

Ming Hong team deserves more than 5 stars, very professional and quick to respond. Few days back we had an emergency order, and we had limited time, we can't thank you enough for going out of the way to make it happen.</review>

<username>Brandt Cross< /username><Text>The professionals here are extremely knowledgeable, and know their products and styles extremely well. I went in for a haircut, but wasn't sure what to get. When the cosmetologist suggested different types of cut and styles that fit my typed hair, I had a better idea of what I could get done. It came out amazing. They also offer military and student discounts as well. I was inane out in less than 30 minutes. I'll definitely be returning in the future.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I went today Tuesday 8, around 5pm to their place on Prosperity/Tulare. The lady that did my hair was nice, but she really didn't know what to do with my hair, I asked her for a book and I showed her what I want, but anyway she did a bad job on my hair, she discounted $2.50 because I wasn't happy with my hair cut. Now, I have to spend much more money in fixing my hair. Very UNHAPPY!! I DON'T recommend the place! NO!</text>

Clean facility, staff can be friendly at times, always in a hurry. Haircuts can be so-so, depending on who you get to cut your hair.<//review>

<Text>DARLENE at this facility can NOT cut hair.

I went to a lady by the name of Sam here one time, GREAT service .

Darlene charged me for a line up and didn’t line me up at all . Actually messed up my line up lol
And that was THE most rushed haircut I’ve ever had in my life. I was in and out of her chair within 5 minutes.
Terrible service.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

TERRRRRRIIIIBBBLLLEEEEE!!! My daughters beautiful hair is ruined! She HAD long beautiful hair and just wanted a 2 inch trim. The girl thinned her hair without asking and cut huge chunks out of the top of her hair so there are random 2" sections of her hair that are 6" shorter than the rest!!! My daughter is a 13 year old girl who is now crying in her room, dreading going to school tomorrow. I am absolutely disgusted by the job this girl did. I could have done a better job!!!! My heart is broken for my poor daughter! I don't know the girls name or I would put her on blast. Ridiculous!!!<//review>

Hate my hair cut! Told the girl specifically what I wanted and she didn't listen at all! My hair was down to the middle of my back and is now almost shoulder length and I asked for less then an inch off(I wear glasses and had to take them off so couldn't see how much she was taking off) ...didn't even let her finish with what I wanted done with my hair because I was scared shed mess it up even more! My baby shower is tomorrow I am so disappointed! Will never go again!<//text>

<review>Horrible experience. From the beginning the girl who checked us in was giving me attitude maybe because she had to cut my baby's hair and. It took her 5 minutes and she didn't even try after she said she was done. Now I have to take my baby somewhere else to get his hair fixed.< /review>< Rating>

Women in here were SUPER helpful and friendly. Made us feel welcomed. They have a great variety of clothing. We ended up spending over $500! Yikes!! But worth it.</Review>

So the selection here is pretty good but the store is somewhat small and everything is kind of crammed together which makes the shopping process somewhat difficult. The customer service girls were all busy assisting other shoppers while I was there so I was left to navigate the tightly packed racks myself, which wasn’t a big deal. They had some cute floral tops but I thought they were a little bit pricey for the quality so I ended up not buying anything.</review>

<Text>They have so many beautiful dresses and the staff is amazing.  They picked a few dresses based on the pictures I provided but they also let me pick some dresses which was nice.   They had beautiful French music playing very softly and there was only one other bride there so the experience was very special. I found THE dress here.  I worked with a few members of the staff here and everyone was great!!<//Text><rate>4</rate><date>1609237200051< /date><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

This particular Torrid always has great deals! A lot of buy 1 get 2 free clearance deals run throughout the year.  The women that work here are generally happy to help you.  They greet you, ask if they can help, then stay out of your way until it's time to get a dressing room.  I'm always happy with their customer service (except for one manager, skinny blond, she was always rude no matter what day I saw her... I'm pretty sure she doesn't work there anymore).  I will always choose Torrid for my plus size clothing, being a fat girl doesn't have to be a bad thing and Torrid will always remind us that we can look beautiful, sassy, daring, and sexy in their wear.<//review>

The employees at TORRID are unkind and unprofessional. It was my first time visiting this store and my last. As I walked into the store and searched for jeans, I over heard the employees talking out loud. One employee said, she's too skinny to be in here as another said, she can't hide all that thickness under there. It made me and my party feel uncomfortable. I am a plus size women and have difficulty finding clothes; therefore, I continued shopping. I patiently waited 5 minutes for a key locked dressing room. I was the only person waiting within the near empty store; meanwhile the three employees were in conversation amongst themselves laughing near the cash register. In the end, the cashier Dani disregarded me. She handed me my bag without looking at me, nor did she say thank you or have a good day. Instead I said it to her. An unfortunate missed opportunity in gaining a loyal costumer.<//Review>

Not nearly as filled as their other stores and what was there was mostly work attire and winter wear..which for the area doesn't really seem appropriate. It's 80 out! Staff was odd and not nearly as friendly as other Torrids either. Walked out without spending even 1 penny of my hot cash. Will pass next time.< /Review>< pictures>

What happened to this store. They used to sale clothes like hot topic but for bigger more beautiful girls. I walked in and felt I was at lane Bryant. I don't even think they had any dark clothing. But their bras still rock!< /review>

I came in here about a week ago to do some spring shopping and there was 3 girls standing behind the register none of them greeted me they just looked at me with a hateful look. I’ve came to this torrid before and it used to be the best I have no idea what happened but their customer service sucks and these girls definitely do not want to be working here they just have these sad and depressed faces never shopping here again.<//Review>

This is a place for plus size women. That being said the prices are outrageous! An ugly sweater made in china retails here for $60, a thin sweater at that. The clothing is all ugly and that isnt because it is meant for plus size women. They should make the designs a lot better but I am sure they just import whayever plus size clothing they find from China. If they are doing that only then the prices should be half of what they are. They are organzied and clean but that is probably because they do not have many customers lol.< /text>

Not a huge selection at the Block and must have gotten new buyers.  Clothing hangs and is very long. All dresses weighed at least 10 lbs! Didn't try on cuz of the weight. I don't shop like I used to, and was excited to buy something for a wedding. Was disappointed</Text>

<Review>July 17th, 2018: Not entirely sure what's going on with this Torrid but I came in mid-afternoon and there was no music playing which I found odd but I didn't mind because I was listening to a podcast on my phone anyway. I was greeted by a tall blonde girl that didn't seem like she wanted to be there AT ALL. I grabbed about 6 items and another depressing/annoyed worker popped out of nowhere and I asked her if I could start a room. I probably grabbed 1 more item and headed to the tiny, dirty room (see below review - nothing changed). I tried on 3 items and heard the AC turn off, which was strange because it was about 87 degrees outside and the doors to Torrid were wide open so it's not like the store was nice and cool. Within SECONDS I thought my glasses started to fog up so I took them off but noticed it was the mirror and within another 30 seconds of me standing looking at the mirror it completely fogged up. This should NEVER happen in a dressing room. I was going to wipe off the mirror and proceed but the mirror was disgusting to begin with and as a customer, I shouldn't have too so I grabbed the only 3 items I tried on and went to the cash register. I asked the girl that rung me up what was wrong with their music and she said it has been out for "about a week" because they got a new system and no one knows how to turn it on and corporate wasn't sending anyone anytime soon to help out. Then she proceeded to say that it probably was going to be off for another 2 days. The employees never informed me about any promotions so I was surprised to see that the bathing suit I got was 40% off and the other items were buy one, get one at the time. I'm so extremely disappointed in this torrid considering nothing has changed within the last few months of my previous visit.

Previous post from May 2018: This Torrid is okay. It's very small and they have all the clothing items so close together. This store is supposed to be for plus size women but half the time me and another lady are bumping into each other because there is absolutely no room! The last time I went here was for lingerie and they didn't have any? Not sure if that's because they had a different floorset and lingerie wasn't "in" at the time, but I always try to update my reviews. But its Torrid so I tried other items on, there were 3 or 4 sales associates but it seemed like only 1 was actually paying attention and helping every customer that came through. My chief complaint at this Torrid would be their FITTING ROOMS. Absolutely disgusting. I didn't want to take my shoes off to try on the pants I brought into the room! There was trash on the floor, the mirrors were dirty, there were black hand prints on the walls and doors like no one had scrubbed them in a LONG time, as well as dust. Dust on the seat, along the mirrors and in the corners of the room. I love Torrid, but I definitely wouldn't recommend going to THIS ONE and that sucks because it's the closest one to my house. Now I have to make the trek to the Irvine Spectrum which has constant construction. . . .<//Review><Date>1532559938655<//Date>< Rate>

<Text>Dr. Bhatia shouldn't even be a doctor, he just tells you what is obvious. Should have his license revoked 3rd time this happens, he seems to not have any common sense on what to say or do and must just be googleing what to do. Last time we come here switching doctors, don't bother coming here not worth the time. He's just going to say "its normal". You can be having a seizure and he will say "its normal. Worthless excuse of a doctor.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I've been a patient at this clinic for over 10 years now and don't have any complaints.. sure there is a wait time- as at any other clinic I've gone to, but since it is a walk-in clinic, I like that I can take my kids in whenever they get sick, without an appointment...
What I really like is their OB care... I came here for all 3 of my pregnancies and nurses and doctors are awesome! They always answered all my questions and concerns AND you get ultrasound picture every visit!
They also offer birth control and STD check-up and another plus is that they have their own pharmacy so can get your medicine right away...
I read some reviews here that it's ghetto and whatever but I think it's a really good clinic, I will keep coming here for all my and my kids healthcare needs<//Text>< pictures>

It got much better, I am a pregnant patient and I see the difference , its a very long wait, the lady from the front give the file to the nurses even though they have a lot files they manage to do it in a courtesy form that makes me feel Im in the right clinic.< /text>

< review>
They are VERY UNORGANIZED, facilities seems so dirty,  too long wait time to see Doctor, receptionist seem like they have no idea what to do. To much social time with co workers..they seem like they really don't care about patients. Hard time getting  a copy immunization records for my son.
I changed doctors cuz my sons health is important.
Never again will I deal with the..<//review>

They give you an ultrasound picture every visit you have with the doctor also when your w 5 weeks I believe not sure they start ur ultrasound 3d they also give you a disk with ultrasound images . Ps. Thank lily for answering all my questions always</Review>< gmapID>

They are horrible horrible HORRIBLE !!!! Have to wait months for lab results, months for medication keep in mind during these months my symptoms are getting worse. Still have not received my lab results still no medication still waiting since February. And everytime they say they're going to give me a call back they never do. HONESTY HAAATEEE THIS PLACE!!! God forbid If things turn for the worst on my behalf I'm filing a lawsuit, this is ridiculous. Don't do the same mistake I did, save yourself and find another doctors office.<//Review>

They dont take appointments, wait time is crazy long I waited 4 hours. The doctor we saw was....lack luster. Went there for an epi pen with all the paper work told him we needed one, waited at the pharmacy only to find out he didn't write a prescription because he "didn't know" we needed one. Pharmacy is fast a thorough.</Review>

I love love love the doctors, feel very welcome and the doctors make you feel comfortable, the nurses are okay as well but the women at the front desk seem so weird, like they talk alot about personal stuff, and stare at you really hard and when you ask questions they make it seem like they're annoyed or dont have the time, i feel like they hate their jobs, i called one day at 5:20 to speak to the doctor about issues with my pregnancy and she told me to call back in 20 mins and by that time it was 5:40 when she knew they closed at 5:30, i had the feeling she didn't want to be bothered but it could have been serious ,after all it was my first pregnancy. They know who they are and pretty sure they know who made this review after my situation.<//Text>

<text>I liked the treatment I was getting for my pregnancy until my baby was diagnosed with a trisomy . Got sent to the Dr who specializes in that (Dr. Bahtia) and my experience went from good to horrible. It was my first pregnancy so everything was new to me especially when I was told my baby wasn’t going to make it , I was devastated and he was treating me as if it was already like my 20th pregnancy , if I asked him a question he answered sarcastically with a grin on his face , he never asked me any questions regarding the pregnancy he just told me to “move on with life” and you wait about two hours just so he can finish with you in less than 5 minutes. When I asked him the risks of a certain procedure I was going to get done instead of answering me with a percentage like how I asked him to he simply said “it’s possible you can die” (ofcourse with that sarcastic voice). To me he is very rude, very unprofessional and lacks communication skills with his patients. I wouldn’t recommend going there (or at least not get seen by him).< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd32b5e9ca17eb:0xb3bacd1f1076a6dc<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I called to make an appointment and they told me they didn't do appointments. I went over to the clinic and I was told that I couldn't just walk in and expect  to be seen that I needed an appointment!  I asked for one and they told me they  didnt have any opeenings within 5 months.  Lack of customer service  and cleanliness  as well<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I was referred ny Karla (lily) .. Drove all the way from La. Hoping it was worth it and it was! As soon as i got there I received paperwork. Was called almost instantly.  Bloodwork was done, vitamins etc were prsscribed and I got an ultrasound.  Next i spoke to nurse she told me where they deliver etc. It was all in all a great visit.  I will definitely be referring others to this office.

I have also read other negative reviews.  I myself am a person who goes off reviews. But theres nothing about this place in my opinion that is true on the reviews. YES there are alot of kids. Doesnt bother me since i have 2 at home. Bathroom is clean.  The office DOES NOT smell. The english/Spanish barrier wasnt an issue for me.

Thanks for great care :)< /review>

Just walked out of social services for their terrible customer service. And just outside an angel in disguise told us of this place. We got health insurance, foodstamps, and a 4d ultra sound all in one day.< /Text>

<text>We recently had a vehicle towed by One Way. In the beginning, they act very helpful, but in the end very unprofessional.  Would not take common forms of payment, like credit or debit cards.  When they agreed to take an in-state check and we arrived to pay with it, they said they would only accept cash. I would not recommend this company and would push my car first.</text></record></dataset><record>

I was there a total of twenty minutes, the first 18 minutes was a back and forth argument of them trying to convince me to sign the release of my belongings. My only request was that I see the vehicle and get my belongings. After I was pressured into signing, they bring in a man from out back to hand me a plastic bag already in their office full of my stuff. After asking him to take me to see the car,he just hands me the bag and mutters,"well if it's not your car then why do you need to see it?" This company is garbage, and they treat everyone as such. Do not go.< /Review>

They seem to do business just fine. I’m assuring that the low ratings are people who got their vehicle repossessed. I was able to grab my stuff that was inside my vehicle.<//text>

This place repossesed my car when I got behind on my payments.  The lady I dealt with in the office was very nice.  She let me get my personal belongings out my car after I paid them $60.00 for "inventory".  The next day my car was delivered to my finance company.   When I got my car back the next day from the finance company my back driver side hub cap was missing.  The hub caps on my car are on pretty tight with the lug nuts.  There is no way it "fell off".  When I called them to inquire about the missing hub cap I was told they had no idea what happened to it.  I informed them that it was there the day before when I got my personal belongings.  I was told they would have the driver call me but I never got a call.  I would not recommend these people as trustworthy.  They seem nice on the outside but my hub cap vanished in their care and they don't seem to care about it.  They act like it is not there problem.</text>

This company’s greed does not have any limits. They don’t take into consideration that there is a pandemic going on during which people help each other out. If you call them to pick up a car, and you come in the next day, they charge you $65 for a no show fee cash only. Only cash</text>

They are a REPO company. All the bad reviews are from people that didn't make their car payment. The only person they have to be mad at is themselves for trying to fraud the finance company. If you just need a tow, they are a GREAT CHOICE!!<//review>

Definitely the worst customer service I’ve ever seen at a business. They answer the phone like they hate their jobs. Every person I’ve spoken to sounds miserable. They will force you to make an appointment to pick up your car from them and still won’t be around at the appointment time. They also charge for storage of property that doesn’t exist.<//text>

This towing company has employees who have sticky fingers.  $40 was stolen out my purse along with all my and my kids phone cords and chargers, my scooby do floor mats, brand new jumper cables and my remote to my garage door, my Steelers frog that sat on the dash and all my bingo dobbers. I called to speak to the owner and of course he has not returned my call as of today. What a pathetic company.</text>

Thieves, very mean, abusive, racist, unprofessional and very rude. They ( Matt) claim my car was clean with nothing in it but little do they know I have a comprehensive surveillance video of my car being towed by them showing my property in the car. They are very rude, racist and outrageously mean to me. I am emotionally tortured. I completed a police report Friday and I am taking this another step higher. I have to reclaim my things. they are thieves and bigots<//review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>ONE WAY TOW are thieves. My car was towed by One Way Tow and when I retrieved it it was completely cleaned out.. All that was left in my car was the owners manual. When I called them to question where my personal property was the lady who answered knew exactly who I was and what car I owned, she sounded surprised that I had the car back in my possession and said she would call me back which she never did. Two days later I contacted One Way Tow again and Matt said my car had no personal belongings in it. He proceeded to tell me that his big burly driver would have no use for my Versace perfume or my Coach glasses. I will be filing a police report in the morning as soon as I talk to the finance company to get the additional information that I need. Among some of my belongings was my checkbook,  my daughters carseat, my Versace perfume, Coach sunglasses, and a pair of shoes. I have already contacted Fresno PD and they have urged me to file a formal complaint for vehicle burglary.<//Review>< Response>

Good food and service.  Steaks are ranch style, not aged.  So know this going in.

Edit: they are aged 14 days thank you for clarifying.  When i said not aged i meant in the sense of other steak houses that marbelize and dry age their beef 30+ days<//Text>

Me and my wife had an amazing dining experience here tonight. From the kitchen staff preparation to the waitresses amazing hospitality and very on top of every need we had. They took amazing care of us! It was our first time eating here, we are from out of town and saw it coming through and stopped with no intentions on how amazing this place would be. We will DEFINITELY be back, I recommend this to anyone for a date night, special occasion or just a casual stop in. The dress code is casual. The atmosphere is very laid back, and satisfaction is their top priority. Just a sample of the first part of our meal, it was amazing!<//Review>

Great meal and drinks. Didn't even get a picture as was too busy devouring to remember to review. Would say comparable to Cool Hand Luke's more than a Fleming's or Ruth's Chris for atmosphere. Meat quality and taste seemed to run with the best of them. Would definitely be a spot to return to, even if it is a 50 minute drive from my house.<//Review>

Love cattlemens but they disappointed today. I placed my order well in advanced they told me it would be ready at 7:30, they call me at 7:30 saying that they don't have 2 options of my order. I am outside walking to pick up my order. Not only did they waste my time but my fuel I don't live close.<//text>

Well, what can I say. We were greeted by the entryway and were advised that there was a 30 minute wait, and that we had to wait outside until we got a text. We went inside to get something to drink and noticed lots of tables available in the bar.Hmmm. Yet we were told  we couldn't have a drink in the bar. Anyways,  we were asked by the front desk if we were waiting and they proceeded to seat us immediately.  Our waiter Stefan was most courteous and took our drink requests.  We got our drinks and ordered some tumbleweeds for the appetizers,  these are the best onion ring extraordinaire.  We ordered Dakota Chicken with bacon, mushrooms,  and a honey mustard sauce. My sister had the New York steak, which came out perfectly cooked. I ordered the Salmon, blackened with baked potatoes all around. Your bread is the best...with the soft dough in the center, and so hearty crust. Tastes so good with lots of good butter. What makes this even better than most other places is that the butter comes soft, ready to smooth on the bread....not tearing up the bread. We enjoyed our meals as always, and left a hearty tip for our waiter. He really enjoys his job, which goes a long way during these times. We try to stop at Cattleman's whenever we come across one in our travels. Thanks again Amigos, for making our visit pleasant and very enjoyable, Robert, Jennie, and Mary from Kingsburg.😎😎😎</Text>

The dinner was so good.  We had not gone out to dinner for a very long time.  The pandemic kept us from going anywhere.  The atmosphere was great,  the servers or so polite made you feel like home.  I had a lobster dinner and it was perfect.  The steak and shrimp was also good, we had not had that great tastes in a long time.  If you’re looking for a great dinner great meals go to Cattlemans, in Selma.</Text>

I ordered a fillet and came overcooked and was offered a new one. The second steak I was brought was cooked perfect but was not a fillet, but a NY strip steak. At that point the rest of my table was done with their entree so I stuck with it. The apple pie dough was also raw in the middle the 1st go around. The appetizers were good at least but that was about it.</review>< Pics>

There was a long hair strand in my daughters hamburger. I understand “things happen” but if I’m paying this much for a meal, I have certain expectations. The waitress was extremely empathetic and the manager came over and apologized. Food was “eh” but the service was good.</review>

Since last visited ... seems like it's gone way down !! Ramon was a great waiter however they were out of pretty much everything our party wanted for some reason the items were only offered on Saturdays.. Also the cuts of meat were not great at all mostly fat and nerves extremely disappointed<//text>

It's very unfortunate that Cattleman's has moved their business outside. I ordered a full lobster dinner, by the time I got done taking the shells off and checking them for any random shells they were luke warm. By the time I was about to finish my first tail the meat and butter were cold. My daughter ordered a sirloin steak medium well. It was still bleeding and a cool center to touch. She showed our waiter and he was kind enough to order her another one at no cost to us. When the new steak arrived at our table, it was worse then the first one and she requested the second steak to be well done. Overall the company was great and our waiter was very helpful. But we won't be back until they are able to open the restaurant and we can eat inside.< /Text>

Food wasn't as good as I heard it was, super disappointed, server kept disappearing, 3 other servers were more attentive to us then are own server. I ordered the prime rib sandwich it was all fat. Their bread and artichoke dip was a 10/10 but that's about it. I most likely won't be going back<//text>

The freshest sourdough bread in the Central Valley with the most amazing real butter.  Ribeye so tender and the Cowboy onions make a great salad and leftovers!  The baked potato is perfectly cooked, moist and filled with everything you would want.  Cody was an excellent server, he provided top notch service, pray you get him waiting your table!</review>

Great bacon wrapped shrimp horduerve and excellent prime rib dinner. Also had great cocktails and enjoyed very good service. The atmosphere is pleasant, but not fancy like a lot of steakhouses. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner and will be returning again soon.< /Review>

4/13/2020 Thank you again for a great meal again.   Today was my birthday and being able to pick up this delicious meal made my day.

This is our families go-to place for a good steak and an all around satisfying family dinner.  It is the only place we will order a steak.   The service is excellent.  Servers our right there when you need something.  Everyone is so attentive and friendly.  It's nice when you can count on some things not changing.<//Text>

Had the shrimp scampi and the shrimp was cold, and so were the mashed potatoes. Last time I went I ordered a steak and it was covered in fat, so I'm a little discouraged on eating there again. Pros: salad was green, beer was cold, bread was warm</Text>

<text>Clean restaurant, friendly service, and the steaks were cooked almost just right. The food portions are generous but the drinks are a bit overpriced.

< Review>
I reviewed the online menu, called, and completed and order online for pickup an HOUR in advance to ensure my meal was completed timely and correctly.
I still had to wait 15 minutes witha car full of dogs for my order.
Amanda was sure to apologize to the people behind me for being upset but what was my apology?!
Sometimes people spend $70 on an expensive meal to feel better about everything horrible going on. Wish my first experience here was as magical as I thought it would be.</Review>

I couldn't resist the urge to pass up this Cattleman's location. This is the 3rd location I've tried and by far this place had the best tasting 2lb mouth watering Sheriff Steak. We had the steak outside, since indoor dining is limited due to the new covid pandemic. Couldn't have made a better choice. If you are craving a steak don't wait until later or next time to have Cattleman's, do it NOW!</Review>

Brought the Wife for dinner for our first time there.  Food was amazing, drinks are humongous, just like you'd expect from a steakhouse!  Great job Cattleman's!<//review>

My experience here were the seats were torn our service well was very very rough I must say that the waitress was somewhat in a rush defeated a big party next to us and our food has small little steaks for what we paid for a family of four was ridiculous for the service that we got I would recommend that anybody who comes visits here please please tell the waitress about their service</text>

<rating>3</rating><review>First time ever to this place as my brother wouldn't stop talking about it. He chose outside dining due to the COVID restrictions, and they sat us outside at a table that looked like they found in a shed with folding chairs that were messed up.
Once this was rectified and we were sat inside, the food was fantastic. The service was ok, but even my brother was disappointed.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Excellent service and high quality food... Best Restaurant in Fresno County!!! You will not be disappointed...Go with family, friends or co-workers.  It is the kind of place where you can celebrate any occasion.  Best salads, appetizers and bread...Their entrees are delicious.  You can select steak, salmon, ribs, chicken... and much more...</Text>

Loved it. Special ordered a 45 oz porterhouse to celebrate my husband's 45th birthday. Chef was very accommodating.< /text>

Good bread, baked potatoes and beef ribs. Grilled shrimp came out cold (server said that's how it's normally served 🤔). Sent it back and shrimp was then warm, tasteless and rubbery. Daiquiri wasn't good. Spent a lot of money but definitely not worth it. Speed of service was good.</text>

We had a reservation and were seated promptly although the parking lot and and restaurant appeared to be almost full! The greeters and waiters were friendly, helpful, and patient, and the manager kept a close eye on everything!
The service was fine, and the food was delicious!
The steaks were done properly as ordered and tasted so good! The shrimp and babyback ribs  were delicious too, as well as everything else! Definitely would recommend Cattleman's in Selma, California!< /text>

I left so full. Plenty to choose from, high low and mid priced. There was a mistake but they recovered with great service and gracious enough to comp a mistaken item. The servers were great despite all the challenges with the new social distancing guideline, 1st sit down meal since the begini g of the pandemic. It was amazing. Thanks!< /review>

Best place to come have a delicious steak! Drinks and desserts are also recommended. I absolutely love the bread and butter they give before your meal. Come prepared with a good appetite because your not going to want to miss a bite.<//Review>

<text>This is usually our favorite spot for the Dinner For 2 with the porterhouse with crab and lobster and went to celebrate Valentine's Day on Feb 16th hoping it wouldn't be too crowded. When we got there at 415pm it was quite busy. Our waitress was helpful, upbeat but very busy. She took our order, but as our items arrived it went from bad to worse. I asked for thousand island for my salad and got Italian and we asked for no onions and got onions. No big deal. I didn't want to bother the waitress as again, she was extremely busy. My coffee was served to me cold. The porterhouse was rare, not medium rare. The crab was super dry and over cooked and so was the lobster. We were stunned because everything is usually really good no matter which location we go to. Unfortunately, for $100, we decided from now on we'll stay in town instead of taking the 20 min trip out.<//text>< pics>

Came in hungry and was not disappointed. Enjoyed the 6 oz Sirloin and Baked Potato. Was just the right size and my steak was cooked perfectly.

Strongly recommend starting with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. Great way to start off a great meal.</review>

Had a rough one tonight. Most of the time this place is on point. Tonight it missed heavily on everything. We came here for our 2 year anniversary. Wifes strawberry lemonaide was just pink water. Took them 15 minutes to come replace it. I gave her my soda in the mean time so she had something.  Ordered filet migon and they brought a ribeye.  On top of that we ordered loaded baked potatoes and they brought regular. So they brought replacements and it just had a huge spoonful of unmelted butter in it. Do not know if it was short staff or what because of covid but definetly not worth the $70 price tag< /Text>

Service was really good... That's as much as I could say for a good review the 45 minute wait on a  Wednesday night I was thinking the food would be really good... I was wrong.. The prime rib was dry and mealy... I've had better At sizzler... My dad's Alaskan king crab was the size of pencils.. Mom's lobster tail was like eating tire rubber... And girlfriends bacon wrapped shrimp was dry and tasteless Over cooked...  It's too bad  I was hoping for a really good dinner. I may not be a pro food critic but I know a decent meal when I taste one  And this was not it..! I haven't been in years now I remember why...<//Text>

What a great experience!  Liam by far is one of the best servers I have had the pleasure of meeting.   He definitely made it a fun evening.  The food met all expectations being from a reputable steak house!  Get the filet smothered in cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms.  To die for!<//Text>

This is a great place to go for steak dinners in our area if you don't want to travel all the way out to Harris ranch or up to Fresno. The steak dinners and all of the sides are delicious the service is always friendly and they have a great bar and lots of parking.  Always Make sure you make Reservations ahead of time.</review>

We went there on Veterans Day and had reservations. I would recommend reservations for any weekend. The place is very busy. The steak was marvelous but the lobster was a bit tough. The service was exceptional.  The wait staff was friendly.  We have visited this restaurant much in the past, I cannot remember a bad steak or prime rib. The salad was fresh and not full of water as sometimes happens with a big bowl of lettuce.  We had a very enjoyable time.  I  can recommend this to any steak lover.  We will not be disappointed.</text>

Nice American steakhouse. On previous visits I had steaks and was not disappointed 😉. Unfortunately, this time I chose the "healthier" shrimp and was quite disappointed. Tasteless, rubbery, veins in and overall unsatisfactory. Guess they should stick to their core competencies. Service was good and the endless salad is a nice feature.<//Review>

What a great experience!  Liam by far is one of the best servers I have had the pleasure of meeting.   He definitely made it a fun evening.  The food met all expectations being from a reputable steak house!  Get the filet smothered in cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms.  To die for!<//Text>

My wife and I like ranch dressing with our haystack, but we went through the ranch they brought us, so I asked our server if we could have some more....she came back with a Gravy Boat full of ranch dressing...she smiled and said she likes ranch too👍👍<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZG8uE6LJCFk6ahX5jU-9nz0hkRguV5VbR5Hy7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Service was really good... That's as much as I could say for a good review the 45 minute wait on a  Wednesday night I was thinking the food would be really good... I was wrong.. The prime rib was dry and mealy... I've had better At sizzler... My dad's Alaskan king crab was the size of pencils.. Mom's lobster tail was like eating tire rubber... And girlfriends bacon wrapped shrimp was dry and tasteless Over cooked...  It's too bad  I was hoping for a really good dinner. I may not be a pro food critic but I know a decent meal when I taste one  And this was not it..! I haven't been in years now I remember why...</Text>

Tried this steakhouse while working in Fresno. It was highly recommended.
I only have it 4 stars because the service was very slow and the place was not very busy.
My rib-eye was cooked perfect.
The endless salad was of good quality and the sourdough table bread with butter was exceptional...just give people more butter than the single pat!
There are more of these restaurants scattered over the southwest so I would be sure to try one if the opportunity pops up!<//review>

<review>Went there to celebrate hubby's birthday. Our waiter didn't give us the all u can eat beans that is supposed to come with the meal. He also didn't tell us some of the sides had an extra charge. When we ordered, he asked what we wanted for our side & listed all the options, but again, failed to tell us that some of the sides he listed would cost extra. The food was mostly good, however, my daughter kept complaining her steak wasn't good; that it tasted like they didn't season it. Mine was great so I thought she was being picky. However, I finally tasted hers & it was true, it didn't seem like they seasoned it. Overall, we were more disappointed in the service. Unfortunately, if the service isn't good, then it ruins the whole experience. Therefore, only three stars.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

It was pretty par for the course.  It's steak and that's great,  but I definitely didn't feel like it was worth spending 30 bucks on it. If I'm going to eat at a restaurant,  I need it to taste better than something I'd grill up at home.  I'm not a chef at all, but this just tasted like a steak.  Not a special steak.<//Text>

Made a reservation for 6pm and when I arrived 10 mins earlier the host told me they were running behind! 8 other parties ahead of me. I waited in my car because there were crowds of people. 45mins later we got a text saying our table was ready. They sat us down .. then we waited another 40mins just for drinks!!! Our server was Megan and she was very stressed out. I could tell she couldn’t handle her section. We ordered my daughter’s food right away because who knew how long that was going to take. But when she took our order we order an appetizer and 2 entrées and drinks from the bar. When all of our food came out..I asked her why our app never came out.. she said “oh yeah..I’m sorry.” I told her forget it..Please take it off the bill!! And that’s all she had to say about it. We ordered steaks .. we had no salt, pepper, or A1!! She never came to check on us!!  My steak got cold by the time someone finally  brought this stuff to us. When I asked her for sour cream.. she literally dropped it and ran! I’ve been in the service industry and this service was horrible!! We didn’t even get a table touch from the manager. She could have turned it around if she offered to take care of desserts or discount on the bill. She didn’t care to make things right! I won’t be going back for awhile. They’re not fully staffed.. and because of that your experience and dinner will suffer for it! I’m leaving this review because I’ve been a manager of a restaurant and you'll never be able to fix this issue if you didn’t even know you had one to begin with.<//Review><username>Ashley J< /username>< rating>

<text>I waited 15 minutes for a table on a Friday night. It was worth it. The food is awesome. The plates range from $25 and up. Service is fantastic. It's a little loud making it difficult to talk to your partner at times but a good place to eat. I recommend this place.< /text><user_id>108792971838760370881</user_id></record></dataset><record>

If you could be negative in stars our experience tonight would be that. We sat at 6:20 did not get food until 8:30 we were told they were backed up and that it be out shortly this is at 45 min. They said they'd send a manager that hadn't happened. At 8:00 a lead came and told us the manager swore cooking our food. When it came out our medium rare steaks were cold, tough, overcooked. We didn't even eat. This was so disappointing we live over an hour away and it was  our son's birthday. They offered to remake but we didn't have the.time to wait or the trust that it be.done quickly. Our meal was comp which well we didnt even eat it. Well instead the baked potatoes cause I was super hungry. Was planning on reserving Valentines but will be going elsewhere.</Review>

Had a awful experience here. Walking in the hostess didn't smile at all, seemed like she hated to be there. The server was pretty friendly. Food was basically a plate of salt. Wish I could zero star this place. Over priced also, save your money and go else where.</Review>

My 1st visit to Cattleman's on Valentine's day. The place was slammed  and for good reason. The food is spectacular! My husband and I had the entree for two special for $70.00 which includes an appetizer, soup or salad,a side choice of mashed potatoes, pilaf, or baked potato and dessert. A lot of food! We had some large doggie bags! We couldn't eat it all. I had the prime rib. Only one word can describe it, perfection. Service was on point. Great casual atmosphere. Looking forward to my next visit.<//Review>

Jaz our server was great. So attentive to our needs. The steak was cooked to perfection. I recommend the cheesecake or the carrot cake for dessert. Defenitaly will stop by again.<//Text>

We made sure to make a reservation and we were seated fairly quick. The food was amazing, our steaks where cooked they way we asked. The sides where also great. For our appetizer we had the trip tip tacos and they weren't bad. The cocktail portions are good for the price. Our servers were awesome and quick. We will definitely be coming back.</Review></record>

This place has a very laid back western atmosphere. The sirloin and lobster take was some of the best food I have ever had! I also really enjoyed the way that they celebrate birthdays by not only singing "Happy birthday" but also by giving the birthday boy/girl a cowboy hat to take home. This is an all around great place, the only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to very slow service. We had to constantly remind the server that we had ordered drinks and were still waiting, as well as remind her what drinks were ordered.< /text>

We had a 4pm dinner reservation and the restaurant was already packed.  I know it was a Saturday.  There is sufficient parking.  I love the cowboy straw hat they pass out to the birthday ppl.  Service and food was excellent.  It will be on our restaurants list in rotation.< /review>

PORTERHOUSE!!!!! If you love steak, you'll love this place. From New York steak to a 2lb PORTERHOUSE. Cooked perfectly to your looking. A must stop if your in the neighborhood for A GREAT steak. Even if your not in the neighborhood, the drive to Selma will be worth it. trust me!!< /Review>

I had the worst experience here, first off the food wasn't good. I had to send back my food twice and to top that someone broke into my truck. I was told by several people and employees that cars had been broken into all week. When the cops arrived they went to ask for the surveillance and they didn't not have cameras. Cattlemens has not done anything to insure the safety of their employees cars nor the customers. 😱😡👎<//text>

Our server Jake was right on it. polite and very attentive. food was amazing. i recommend the 14 oz rib eye. we had a party of nine and we never had to ask for refills or bread. if you go on a Friday or weekend,  expect longer waits for everything. the wait is worth it. this steakhouse wil make any vegetarian cry.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>This was a pleasant surprise. A few years ago I stopped eating meat, so even the occasional trip to Cattlemen ceased. But I joined a party and found that Cattleman had a very nice salmon available.  But aside from a very well prepared salmon dish, I was impressed with the service and the other meal choices. Good green salad served family style. The potatoes and other side dishes were excellent. Overall, I'm very pleased with Cattlemen Steakhouse.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I was really disappointed when I couldn't go to Cattlemen's for my birthday. So I am glad I found out that you can make reservations online. I am glad I did, because it was busy in there! Liam was an awesome server. He made sure to get my kid's food out first. The wait was a bit long for the adults food, but with bread, salad, and more delicious bread I'm not complaining. The bread is so good I could just eat that! My appetizer, artichoke dip, was yummy. My filet mignon and baked sweet potato were also so good! It is pricey, but worth it for a once in a while treat.<//Text>

Bottomless fresh tasty salad. Flavorful but tired king crab. Toughest prime rib south of the Picket Wire. A generous cut, but not enjoyable. Baked potato was nice. Cheesecake very good. Fine service.< /review>

I don't know why this place has many 4 or 5 stars..the place was not as big or nice as I thought..the food was not good. The baked potato is so PLAIN..then I ordered steak tacos the meat comes out bloody red..yuk. Had it returned was not happy AT ALL WILL NOT GO BACK. The waiter was cool..never took long to make his rounds back wish I could remember his name Mexican guy</Review>

<text>Very popular place. Gets very busy, and can be very loud. The service is delicious, and the food is top notch. It is on the pricey side, just so you know and can be ready. They are good sized on the portions, and accommodating when you need to substitute for an allergy condition. Highly recommend making a reservation. It's not mandatory, but may be the only way to get served some nights.</text>< pictures>

Food is great!! Servers are very friendly! Never had a bad meal there and have always been happy with the staff. I recommend their haystack as an appetizer! My wife and I like ranch dressing with our haystack, but we went through the ranch they brought us, so I asked our server if we could have some more....she came back with a Gravy Boat full of ranch dressing...she smiled and said she likes ranch too👍👍< /review>

The Steaks are good not perfect but good and the experience in general is great. Really recommend the tumbleweed onion. Split a 2lb steak with someone you get more out of your money with that.< /text>

It was really good, they are a steakhouse so the steak was excellent. I was very happy with what I ordered. My son ordered Salmon though & said it was a little dry. The salad was very good as well.< /review>

<Review>We waited about 15 to 20 minutes to be seated which was not bad at all. Right after we were seated our waitress Ashley Botello was just awesome she recommended a drink that was excellent she was very courteous ride our dinner tour table right away it was excellent. She came to our table three or four times check on us asked us if we needed anything. Totally recommend this place our dinner was excellent customer service was great thank you Ashley for making the night a great night.<//Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

< Review>
Husband and I went for my birthday. The second we walked in, we were seated.  As soon as we were seated they placed warm bread and butter on our table.  We skipped the appetizers and ordered our dinner. I ordered the steak and shrimp.  He ordered Pete's Special.  Our meals came with all you can eat salad, our choice of side, and beans.  We must of been having a great time. It only seemed like minutes after we ordered that we got our meal.  Every item that was ordered was delicious! It was one of the most satisfying meals we had in a long time.  The service was great.  The atmosphere is country cozy.  Definitely a place we will be visiting again.<//Review>

I felt like the service was really good. My family celebrated my great-grandfather's 80th birthday today. We had a party of 25 people and we had only one server helping us. He did a great job but it probably would have been easier to serve us if he had someone helping him.  My food was delicious i got a specialty hamburger. My brother and sister ordered t-bone steaks and they were a little substandard. One was severly charred and one tasted a little like soap. Over all it was okay</text>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Good food, but it's a good idea to make a reservation as the wait can be long. Our last visit was on Fathers Day. We had a reservation, so we got seated right away. The apps came out fast, but our order got held up by a long time. It was really busy, so I cut them some slack, but it ended up taking a really long time. People seated after us ate and left before we got our food. Our server was really nice and apologized a lot. He made it right at the end, so I'm not going to ding them with a bad review because they usually aren't that slow. I'm chalking it up to it being Fathers Day.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I also saw employees eating food off people's plates after they left. The food was pretty good so I guess I can't blame them too much. Service was a bit odd... Almost too much attention. I'm glad they kept coming by to see how we were doing but they didn't need to constantly interrupt with small chat and questions not related to the meal. I good place to go if you like the western theme and good food.<//review>< pics>

Ribeye is to die for. Perfect seasoning and every bite is savoring with steak juice.<//review>

Always a good time.  Quality is always consistent.  The best Italian dressing anywhere.  Shrimp cocktail is the perfect size appetizer.  I go there 1-2 times per month.<//Text>

I ordered the Dakota Chicken entree. It seems like they forgot it in the oven and toasted the cheese too much. It was burnt around the edges and stuck to the dish. Has anyone ordered this entree before? It is supposed to look like the picture I submitted?  I would appreciate some feed back. As of now, I'm not sure if I will comeback to this restaurant. I was disappointed with the presentation of the food I ordered.   Thanks!
P.s.. I don't think I'll  be able to recommend this place to family and friends. More than likely, I won't go back either.< /Text>

Always glad to come here for a good steak.
It beats the fancier places up in River Park by a mile, better food, better serving staff, one of the best steakhouses by far.<//text>

Great food, polite servers but not enough of them, so service was slow. Drinks were not mixed well and bar service was terribly slow, again, my bet is not enough coverage. My group also appreciated the value. The selection, and cook quality was on par with more expensive steakhouses we've been to.<//Text>

This a valley favorite steak house. Been coming here since i could walk. They have really good food and service. Just some days there is noticeable difference in quality of food. Must be different cooks.< /Text>

Disappointed. There was four of us for dinner with two of the three steaks over cooked. The one steak that was ok had a large strip of fat and gristle along the edge.  They brought one meal out and it took over 10 minutes for the remaining meals to come with two needing to be sent back. We had to ask for beverages and they refilled one with the wrong drink. They did give us two free desserts but we asked for coffee with the dessert and didn't get it until the dessert was about gone. This was the second time the food wasn't that good for an expensive $125 meal for four. Not worth the money.< /text>

It is best to make a reservation. All you can eat salad, great appetizer options, and friendly service.The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. It is tough to get a steak prepared to my liking and the cook definitely nailed it!! We especially enjoyed the special bar drinks. Will return soon!</review>

<Text>Good food if they get the order right. We've been there many times and I'm particular about how my steak is cooked. I would say 30% of the time, my steak will not be cooked to order and often have to have it cooked more. Last night I switched steaks with my son even though they were different cuts because mine was under done and his was over done.....besides that....the food is great...if the order is done correctly.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x8094f03e54e050fd:0x28b03e1124014384</gmapID></record>

This place is great! I have lived in Fresno the majority of my 46 yrs and never came here. Decided of the 50th anniversary special and Mother's Day for my wife. We will definitely return. We had a nice accommodating waitress (Kelly B.) and stayed on top of things even though extra busy with proms and Mother's Day.<//text>

Wow, the steaks are great! And you'd better come with a big appetite! Our meals came with all-you-can-eat salad and bread. Expect a lobby-full of people ahead of you at dinnertime on weekends. Service was friendly but a little hit-or-miss, possibly due to the influx of dinnertime patrons at the time. Not sure.</Text>

This is by far the best steakhouse I’ve been too since I’ve been in California and way better than Harris Ranch. Customer service is great. The Sourdough bread here is home made and extremely soft and fresh. I ordered the T-Bone which was cooked to perfection and my girlfriend ordered the butternut squash which I had a taste of and I thought it was cooked perfectly as well. The garlic mashed potatoes that come as a side are amazing. There is also a lovely ambience here that just makes you feel at home and welcome. 5 stars all around</text>

This place is great. My dad ordered the New York style steak and in was delicious. We had a great time. The service was awesome. When you go ask for Oscar he has a great personality and is a great server. I will come back anytime.< /Review>

<Text>We've always had great service from knowledgeable servers! We always get the artichoke dip appetizer. Over the top delicious ❤
The steaks are made to perfection and the lobster tail is tender, sweet and so far, never over cooked. Make sure you get the twice baked potatoes!
The last two times we've got the dinner for two. There's so much food that dessert has to be to-go!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Reservations were on time for a Friday night dinner with friends. Appetizers and dinners were all good. Service was a little slow and my wife had an issue receiving a second glass of wine (after server offered her, we had to ask two more times before she finally got it).</Text>

<text>I've been to this restaurant numerous times.  Wish they'd learn how to manage reservations,  this place is the poorest at getting you seated in a timely manner.  So if you'd like to wait at LEAST 30 mins. after your reservation time, this is the place.  My time is worth more than an overpriced meal, no matter how good it is.<//text>< Pics>

Had a group dinner. The service people need to ask their customers who wants butter, A1 sauce, sour cream, etc -prior- to the arrival of their main dish. One should not have to wait for butter while their potato gets cold or A1 sauce for a cold steak. Employees were friendly and the food tasted great.  We will be back.<//Text>

The service was great, all the food except the steak was also great which is the reason for the second star. To elaborate on the steak it was not cooked correctly, covered in onion strings which was hiding the fact that it had absolutely no grill or char marks on one side of the steak. The other side had partial grill marks going one direction only that tells me they never turned my steak on the one side. Not sure how the side with no grill marks was cooked but it looked like is was cooked in a pan with low heat. The restaurant was not busy (they had just opened on a Sunday afternoon) so this being my first time eating at this steak house i was super unimpressed. I will probably give this place one more try and if that doesn't pan out ill never be back. We spent over 120 dollars (just my wife and I) on this dinner with the expectations of having an amazing steak dinner and we were both greatly disappointed.< /Review>

100% have always gotten our food cooked perfectly every time we’ve been here. I stopped eating meat and still came for my boyfriend- he loved his steak and it appeared perfect👌🏼 I ordered the salad (just a basic salad nothing special), amazing fresh sour dough, a baked potato with chives, and the butternut squash- phenomenal. Service great- amazing atmosphere. Come with your kids- come on a date- come to celebrate.</text>

NAPKIN POLICE!!! Came here for a special dinner with my family and spent well over $200. The cloth napkins are dirty and used so we asked for paper napkins instead. The waitress said she had to get permission from the manager to give us paper napkins!! Finally the manger shows up with NO JOKE, exactly 1 single paper napkin for each of us! He said the paper napkins are very costly at about 30 cents each so they only offer them to high paying customers<//text>

Best part was having Michelle as our waitress.  She was prompt, courteous, pleasant and always had a smile.  We sat in the bar which can be hectic on Friday nights, let alone during the holiday season.  It did not waiver her attitude a bit, very professional!

We will definitely be stopping again if driving through during dinner time.< /text>< Pictures>

The food was spiced well, but the cut was extremely fatty. All you can eat salad and bread redeemed quite a bit though. Overall the place is good, but I don't think it is justified by the price.<//Review>

While for the food. But man did it was worth waiting for my order. They being with the appetizers, then some salad. Then for the big reveal my plate of steak. (Which was so good btw) when I was finally done, they asked me for dessert and waited patiently I received a beautiful slice of cheesecake!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Waste of time, wait was too long, food was dry, the ranch style beans were pinto beans seasoned with really tart spices, the steak was tough, the baby back ribs were very dry as well as the baked potatoes, the salad after onions were removed  could still be tasted, very overpriced.
Do not go off the beaten trail, not worth it, go to the Dog House Sports Grill in Fresno, great tri tip and excellent prices!<//text>

<text>We did the Valentine's dinner...sirloin with lobster tail and all the fixings. It was delicious meal. This is your second time here during Valentine's Day, reservations is a must, waited no more than 5 min. Nice place servers are fast, nice,didn't wait long for our food. The only thing I would have liked was dessert considering we paid $70+ not including tip. We'll be going again probably every Valentine's day. 😊❤<//text>< Pics>

1st time for my wife and I after seeing the sign from travelling the Hwy 99...
Big full parking lot did bother us since we had a reservation. But being handed the light up buzzer and waiting outside did bother us...
Large parties kept our server delayed to attend to us...
The salad/bleu cheese dressing and the sourdough bread, beans and twice baked potatoes were worth the wait but wife's salmon and my rib-eye steak needed help in the flavor dept...
We might give them another try but will stick with an appetizer and salad/bread...<//text>

In my opinion the food has been on a decline for a while now but that was always substituted by excellent service, but this was not my experience recently. Our server Josh was extremely rude, did not make eye contact once while taking our order, seem to be inconvenienced and annoyedat our request for anything. I thought someone at our table might have offended him so I asked our group if anyone knew him, no one did but everyone noticed the attitude. This will be the last time at Cattleman's for my family and myself.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Sorry to say, but it was not a good experience.  This was not the fault of the service.  I don't know what happened in the kitchen. Of our party of ten, one person's dinner baby back ribs was burnt which cause a delay, another's dinner raviolis was delayed later than the ribs and the 3rd dinner beef ribs had to be boxed to go because it was so delayed.  However there was no charge for these dinners. Their food is good but I wanted my steak well done but it wasn't.<//Text>

Stopped on our way to Lancaster for the holidays as we had a great experience a little over a month ago.  Got the Cowboy steak and my wife got the steak and lobster.  Both were perfect!

Best part was having Michelle as our waitress.  She was prompt, courteous, pleasant and always had a smile.  We sat in the bar which can be hectic on Friday nights, let alone during the holiday season.  It did not waiver her attitude a bit, very professional!

We will definitely be stopping again if driving through during dinner time.<//Text>

Our server SAYA gave us outstanding service! The food/steak is well seasoned and cooked to perfection of our liking! Everyone is extremely friendly with great big smiles! A great team Cattlemen has! Love this place & definitely recommend it!

*Advice for first timers, make a reservation & come on time because they are ALWAYS packed & busy! Enjoy!</text>

Very attentive and relaxed staff. Every item of food was delicious. Would highly recommend the tumbleweed fries. And the sweet and spicy sauce with my tri-tip roast steak was one of the best sauces I've ever eaten. A real experience.</Review>

Never had anything there that I disliked. I am very partial to their prime rib, medium rare and it is so much better than every other place I've been to.</review>

<Review>Although Cattlemen's is a chain, this specific one gives a local vibe. This place is definitely Selma's hidden gem. All steaks are amazing. The salmon was also very good.<//Review>< user_id>

Good prices, great food, service is awesome. Atmosphere is fun, they sing for birthdays and anniversaries.  Can get a little loud so not really a place for someone looking for a quiet dining experience.< /Review>

Very good food, though sometimes they may tend to over cook steaks. Service is always top notch. I drive from Madera to eat there, lobster is usually very good and bacon wrapped shrimp is a must. The place is in desperate need of a remodel though, especially the very old carpet.<//Review>

<Text>Stuffed mushroom awesome, as well as the baked mashed potatoes smothered in cheese, bacon, and sour cream.
The meat on the other hand.... not impressed at all. Which is why you go here. Probably wont be back. Not for the price. Can buy a better piece of rib eye at B&L Meats in Visalia and have my fiance grill it better then they can!<//Text><gmap_id>0x8094f03e54e050fd:0x28b03e1124014384<//gmap_id><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

The food is great, big portions of quality food, good mixed drinks, excellent wine selection.
But the service really made this the fun and satisfying experience this was. Our server Leah really was the cherry on top for our visit. It wouldn't have been the same without her.
She was funny, bubbly, cute and really an amazing server. She did mention that service hasn't always been the greatest, but they have a new manager now and he's a really nice guy. Unfortunately, she did mention that she's leaving soon :(

I definitely recommend this place regardless though, we WILL be coming back.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x8094f03e54e050fd:0x28b03e1124014384< /Gmap_id></record>

We just had the most amazing dinner.  Our server, Katie was delightful!   We're wondering why we waited so long to try this place.< /text>

< Review>
We made reservations for 6 and were seated right away.  The table was in the middle of one of the dining areas.  Immediately I knew seating was going to be tight.  Our party had 4 adults, my 12 year old grandson and 8 year old grandson.  We stood there trying to figure out where to sit 6 people at a table suitable for 4 adults.  We finally settled in.  The service was exceptional.  We ordered appetizers.  The shoe string onions were cold.  Then our salad arrives and were are trying to make room for in the middle of the table.  Our dinner arrives.  My New York and my daughter inlaws Filet Mignon are cooked well not medium as ordered.  The beef ribs off the childrens menu are huge and apparently cooked hours before they were served and mostly bone with very little beef.  I ordered broccoli as my side and it was cold.  Our bill came to 186.68 which I paid for and a $35.00 tip was left for the waiter.  We were celebrating my son's 38th birthday and it was he choice to dine there.  I only gave 3 stars because the service was good not the food.<//Review>

Came here for dinner on Easter with a party of 5 and although the restaurant wasn't crowded, got placed at a table designed for 4. Service was slow and some of the food arrived late and cold. Steaks and prime rib were tasty but on the fatty side. This would probably be a 2 star review but giving an extra star considering it was Easter and likely short staffed.</Review>

The food was amazing! Everything tasted so wonderful! I was amazed at the kids menu food. I've never seen such great meats in a childrens menu! My kids loved their food. We had probably the best waiter we have ever had, ever at a restraunt. Wonderful service!  So much food we couldn't eat it all. The Atmosphere is so fun too. Great experience!</text>

My steak was good but a little over priced for what u get. Baked potato was very hot, but the shrimp and beans were cool to the touch. The sourdough bread is very good.</Review>

We heard this place was very good. We went for my husband's bday and we were not satisfied. The service was very poor. Our waitress did not bother to ask if we needed refills. We complained about our steak having excess fat and our waitress ignored us and slowly walked away. It was very awkward. There was a few times that she would walk right pass our booth and ask other customers how they were doing and didnt acknowledge us. The only time we seen a big smile was when we got handed the tab. It was extremely pricey. I do have to say the brownie and cookie desert was good. The sirloin steak that we had was average. We were handed nearly empty A1 sauce and ketchup.This is our first and last time visiting this place. I hope everyone else dining in would have a better experience.< /review>

<review>My experience would have been better if my waitress wasn't so rude .Jamie I think was her name was terrible and arrogant. Every time I would ask for anything I felt like I was being an inconvenience to her. I hope if we ever decide to go back I don't have to deal with that again, I won't be so nice about it next time.</review><user>101110160455133229895< /user><Date>1360789657355</Date></record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Tonight a group of me and my co workers went to celebrate a birthday and this being my first time ever coming here I couldn't wait for the experience. Well just no this was my first and last time I will be visiting this establishment!!   We had reservations at 730pm didn't get seated until almost 830pm and the server has attitude from the beginning and fail to tell us that they were out of alot of items. I don't see how a restaurant that is open only 5 hours a day can't provide enough food for the night. And when a steak is ordered rare come straight out of the refrigerator cold as hell. And when you tell the manager he could careless. I guess I will just stick to the taco trucks on the side of the road were you get awesome food and way better service for half the PRICE!! If your wondering what location that if you guys have more Selma👎< /text>< pics>

We made a reservation for 17  Saturday at 7:00 a few days before our event. When we all arrived they lost our reservation, we had our email confirmation and they said it would be 15 min. An hour later still no table... We had little ones with us who were hungry...we would of left but where in Selma could you get dinner at 8:00 pm for 17. 8:15 we were seated. 8:30 they finally took our drink order. 8:45 we got our drinks. 9:30 we got our dinner which was overpriced for the quality of food and the steak was cold.We left the restaraunt at 10:00pm  without any discount or apology for our inconvenience. We will not be going back.< /text>

I called same day to make a reservation for 5 at 630pm. We showed up and were promptly seated. The staff was friendly and attentive. In our party we had my parents both retired snd over 55, my wife and I both in our late twenties and early 30s and a 12 year old child. There was choices for everyone. My wife and I loved our meal although my wifes steak was medium well and she ordered well done, the steaks had great flavor. The child enjoyed his food, my mothers steak salad was not impressive to her, she felt the meat was too tough. My father over all liked his steak but felt it had to much fat on it. Deserts were all great, the  new york cheesecake is great, about 4 inches thick and very fluffy. Over all a great dinning experience. Had everyone in my party been impressed i would have rated 5 stars.<//text>

<Text>Overall it was good. The service was stretched thin. Our sever was overwhelmed??, but she tried to make things right.  2 out of 3 steaks were right on the money, the third was tough and lacked flavor.  Everything else was great.< /Text>< pics>

<Date>1535521471834<//Date><Rate>3< /Rate><Text>We recently celebrated our mother's 70th birthday here. While the servers were very polite, they obviously don't have the staff to handle the crowd they get. We were sat in the corner of very back room(there were 11 of us). I am disabled, but I was able to squeeze in between the wall and table.
Our drink & appetizer orders were promptly taken, but I was never offered a refill the entire time (though my brother who was sitting right next to me was offered one, even though my cup was empty and his was half full). I figured I'd ask for a refill when she brought his back, but she pretended to not hear me when I started talking to her. I guess the eye contact and my moving lips threw her for a loop.
The chicken I bought was rubbery and not worth the price at all.  The mashed potatoes were dry and chock-full of very stale chives or green onions that was like chewing cud.
Thankfully my mother appeared to be enjoying her meal, and never needed a refill or any extras.
I also asked two seperate servers for a straw and never received one(even though I later noticed most servers had them in their apron).
All in all, it seems I was ignored because I was sitting at the end of the table, and therefore an inconvenience for the servers to bother paying attention to.
I didn't complain because I wanted my mom to have the perfect day, and she was having a good time(though she later told me her steak was very tough). But my brothers noticed the staff ignoring me, as did the family at the neighboring table. They even apologized to me because they felt bad(the family, not the servers).

On the way out, as I was slowly making my way through the crowd near the entrance, a Cattlemens employee quickly walked right in front of me, kicking my crutch out from under me and didn't even stop. If it wasn't for a man who was waiting to be seated who jumped up and helped me stay on my feet, I'd have fallen hard. It was really quite embarrassing.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Even if it's 2 people call ahead you'll save time and won't have to wait.

Well worth the drive from Fresno. The Dixon restaurant is excellent too.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Horrible lobster, steaks were fatty, lamb was cold and mixed veggies has onion in it, worst dinner here in a long time, not going back anytime soon. Random guy delivering steak to dinner wanted to bet my husband $200 that it was the best steak ever.<//Review>

<text>We heard this place was very good. We went for my husband's bday and we were not satisfied. The service was very poor. Our waitress did not bother to ask if we needed refills. We complained about our steak having excess fat and our waitress ignored us and slowly walked away. It was very awkward. There was a few times that she would walk right pass our booth and ask other customers how they were doing and didnt acknowledge us. The only time we seen a big smile was when we got handed the tab. It was extremely pricey. I do have to say the brownie and cookie desert was good. The sirloin steak that we had was average. We were handed nearly empty A1 sauce and ketchup.This is our first and last time visiting this place. I hope everyone else dining in would have a better experience.<//text>< Pictures>

Service was terrible. I ordered a salad and all I got was my dressing. The others in our groups food was either cold or they didn't receive their order. Our drinks sat on the bar until they reached room temperature. Bad, bad, bad service.<//Review>

The staff is super friendly. There is however a long wait time Friday and Saturday nights for tables and booths. The bar area gets super packed as well on those days. Food is kinda over priced for what it is. Even happy hour prices for food is over priced.</Text>

First time at Cattlemen's Steakhouse, let me tell you, I am not impressed. First, it took our waiter 15 minutes to bring out drinks, and another 15 minutes for a refill of water, that we requested 4 times. The fried onion appetizer and salad tasted good. I ordered a ribeye, that was dry and didn't taste that great. There were four of us, naturally we all ordered steaks, they were all dry and tasted okay. The service was awful, in my opinion not tip worthy, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to refill a water cup, the waiter walked passed our table plenty of times and not once offered a refill. Long experience short, we will had more fun talking about the bad service and won't be returning for a second chance. If I'm going to pay money for a steak I want it to taste good.</Review>

<Review>A lot of people i know say this place is really good. So i went there for the first time and i thought it was ok. I order a Filet Mignon and i didn't expect for it to be charbroiled. I'm not a fan of that. But i will say the tender. The flavor was not there for me.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

First they stuck us in the back kids room with screaming kids out of control..... parents were complaining and letting their unruly kid scream to high heaven.  No excuse...... destroyed my whole evening with my son.

2nd. The food was all late getting to the table.  The other guests were already half done or all the way through their dinner before they brought me my food.

3rd.  Once the food arrived it looked like it was frozen chicken that they smothered in sauce.  They must have sent someone out to get chicken wings somewhere else like a 7 eleven or something ? Sucked big time.

4th.  Then they forgot my soms lobster..... what a joke.

5th. The the manager looking like straight up Mexican Cartel members approached our table and acted as if everything was alright even though they did not comp the meails.  Walked out with $ 165.00 tab, left a $3.00 tip.

6th.  I'll never go back unless they change cooks and managers.

Please make sure that you consider all other options before going to the Cattlemans again..... I got sick after returning home, so i am sure they put something in my food.

I got the filet, it was cooked perfectly.  The artichoke dip was also delicious but my favorite is the carrot cake, best I've ever had.  Service was also great.  Great job Cattlemans!</text>

<Text>Food was ok, employees were something else. We sat next to the kitchen entrance and wow. Employees were eating off of people's plates before they went out to the table. Employees were locking there fingers before grabbing the plates. I mean wow, and the head chef was just standing around doing the same thing. Will not, definitely will not return, we felt grossed out.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Just a tad over priced for what we got. Ordered a Mohito, bar has no business making one all they did was add ice a sprig of mint in a highball glass and add 1oz rum and soda water. No crush in the mint in the bottom of the glass after adding  sugar, or. and lime to release the flavor. Tasted just like bad soda water. THEN we waited and waited and they never brought our cowboy beans! Brought both to their attention and to get the FULL bill, no correction​ what so ever. Bad....< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8094f03e54e050fd:0x28b03e1124014384<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went with my husband Under the Legarreta reservation the service was horrible, the waitress was so unprofessional,  our steaks were then half fat, this is first time we were unsatisfied with Cattlemen's,  it was so so DISAPPOINTING,  IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME TAKING OUR GRANDSON WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND WE WERE SO EMBARRASSED BY THEIR SERVICE AND QUALITY OF FOOD< /Review>

Went with a group of 6 at prime time and didn't wait long at all. Our waitress Leah was absolutely amazing and the manager even stopped the talk to us for awhile. Our drinks were never empty, portions were huge and we took food home. I had the filet mignon and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Highly recommended.< /review>

Incredible dining experience, I couldn't find anything wrong.
Great food, filet mignon was perfect, every part of the meal was perfect.
Excellent service, my server Nic took care of me proper, very attentive & on point.
Well, worth the money...

I'll be back for sure.<//Review>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>Our group of six ate here for a birthday dinner on a Thursday evening. This place stays very busy since is the only steakhouse for miles.Three of us ordered prime rib with twice baked potato (tbp), one had a filet with tbp, one had a ribeye with tbp, and one had ribs with fries.
The prime rib and steaks were cooked as desired, but all lacked flavor compared to Texas Roadhouse steaks. The twice baked potatoes were over seasoned for three of us, the other two didn't notice.
Server was friendly but took too long between courses even considering how busy they were. At the end we had to chase down our server to get a bill so we could leave.
We consider Cattlemans to be over priced for what you get. They do a great business as they are the only steakhouse for miles,but we won't be back.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great food and good service. Staff tends to be lax with reservations, which can lead to longer wait times.< /Review>

Love Cattlemans! The service is always good, food is fabulous (I always order the filet mignon). It takes awhile to get a cocktail in the bar if you are waiting for a table on a busy night, but overall this place is great!< /Review>

Bunch of douchbags. Had reservations for 7 than made us wait 40 mins before seating us. Food took over 30 mins to get out to us. Waiter charged me for a tip on my card without knowledge and took the cash I handed him for the tip without telling me they charge your card for a tip. Horrible service all around. Mash potatoes were cold when I got my food. Horrible experience would not reccomend this restraunt at al</Text>

The pork ribs were way over cooked (crispy and dry) and my twice baked potato (that I paid $3 extra for) was cold.  Do not waste your money here.< /text>

Cattlemans has really stepped up on customer service & food lately. We drive all the way from Visalia to get a good steak. Sure, we have a few steakhouse here in Visalia but they're no comparison to Cattlemans in Selma. Kudos to Jose and his team.< /text>

I've seen a lot if reviews for this restaurant, so I thought it would be the best pick for my son's 22nd bday party.. Boy was I WRONG! In the middle of SUMMER, the thermostat was set at 85°F, the steaks didn't have ANY seasoning on them, the JUMBO shrimp were a lot more like MEDIUM BUTTERFLIED shrimp! My daughter in laws shrimp scampi was NOT scampi. For anyone that hasn't been to Cattlemens, but wants to check it out, you can get WAY BETTER at The Outback or Tahoe Joe's or even Cool Hand Luke's! Cattlemens SUCKS! LITERALLY! IF U DON'T KNOW WHAT A GOOD STEAK IS, CATTLEMENS IS YOUR PLACE!< /text>

The steaks were over cooked.  Bread was burnt.  They were busy, but I'm still paying the same price.  Disappointed.<//Text>

The waitress taking our drink order didn't know what grand Marnier was. The berry mojito tasted horrible. We asked for pinot noir and she came back what kind of rum do you want with that? The steak that was ordered was the boneless rub  eye steak and we got a steak with a bone.everytime the waitress made a mistake she would rub his shoulder and say I'm sorry. We won't be back!!< /Review>

Took about an hour for food to be served and at that food was cold. Managment wasnt great at all. They had mixed up our orders twice untill the third time they finally got it right. After an hour and fourty minutes we finally ate. Worst experience.< /text>

Took about an hour for food to be served and at that food was cold. Managment wasnt great at all. They had mixed up our orders twice untill the third time they finally got it right. After an hour and fourty minutes we finally ate. Worst experience.<//Review>

Started off by getting drinks at the bar. Was ignored by three staff, one bartender was actually directly in front of us polishing wine glasses. Meanwhile my date and I sat until they finally decided to get us a drink ( there was nobody else at the bar mind you). Worst watered down drink I've ever had. I asked for a double and couldn't even taste any alcohol. Then our buzzer went off so we could be seated and I couldn't be happier. We sat down and ordered a two person dinner. Appetizer never came until it was asked for ( which was after our meal arrived) and the meal was barely luke warm. Also for it being a "steak house" the steaks were less than an inch thick. My date got the fillet which was not a round cut of meat (which I thought was a general characteristic of a filet ). Bad service all around. I used to go to Cattlemans growing up and I thought it was a special place. Sad to see that it is being run like this. Seems like managment doeant care about quality anymore. Will not be going back anytime soon.< /Review>

horrible dinner last night 10/10/14.
we had 7:30 pm reservations for my wife and myself, got sat in a booth and pretty much forgotten about. about 8 pm a waiter finally came by and introduced himself and left. long story short, we had bread with no water or beverages from the bar that we ordered for a long time. then he took our order and tells me they are out of prime rib after i order it. i then ordered a rib eye steak rare and the wife ordered triple threat brochettes medium. we still dont have water. dinner comes out, the wifes dinner was a obviously a combination of at least 2 different cooking attempts, half was well done and the other was raw, mine was a medium but do able. her baked sweet potato and my baked potato both needed another 20+ minutes in the oven, very hard and not a soft baked potato at all.
i talked to the manager 2 times but he was difficult to understand at best and he suggested i call him before coming next time and he will save me a piece of prime rib, really?
it was friday payday, how can they be out of prime rib at that time and the service was horrible.
we usually have a good dinner there but last night was rather upsetting.
i think it will be Black Angus next time. its cheaper anyway and alot closer.
we spent close to $100 and had to go to McDonalds when we were done!</review>

The artichoke cheese dip is a must! The steaks are also good, there's times where either they've under cooked or over cooked my steak but they usually make it right.</Review>
