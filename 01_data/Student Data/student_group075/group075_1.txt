<rate>1<//rate><userid>116377724409226235793</userid><Review>Desert Islands and move out review.   Rim properties will take your security deposit even if you left the apartment in immaculate condition. Our move out inspection found nothing to be cleaned.  It is move in ready for the next tenant.  We spent days cleaning and made sure every single item on the pre-move out inspection was done.  Even though when we moved in, it was filthy and we also did not have a move in inspection.  We left the apartment way better than we found it.  Rim properties still took $150 for cleaning even though our move out inspection found nothing to be cleaned.  Why even do a move out inspection twice when they will still charge you a cleaning fee?  So, Rim properties will waste your time and still take your money.
Additionally,  I was made to believe that we would be reimbursed if we left the apartment earlier than written notice because the apartment was already rented.
Lastly, and more importantly, our bedroom wall is shared with the neighbor's living room.  It was a living hell, our neighbor plays his loud bass and video games at different hours of the day and night.  Rim properties was aware of the problem and did nothing to remedy.  It was a horrible situation.  There was no enjoyment of the rented property as we were always on hyper alert when we would hear the loud boom.. boom noise on the shared wall even if we close the bedroom door during the day.  So bad that we moved the bed in the living room.< /Review><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

The few staff members was wonderful. Micheal, the owner? Yelled at me in a court building in front of my attorney because I paid him 1200 to work my case. They evicted me while I was on military orders over in Washington State. Micheal didn't care in I was on military orders. After Judge vacated their judgement, I left.< /Review>

<text>I had the opportunity to deal with one of the partners at RIM Properties; Michael Bryant concerning an issue I was experiencing. Mr. Bryant, expressed his concern, which was not only sincere, but his actions validated his concern and he swiftly dealt with the issue and immediately resolved it. I have been renting my entire adult life and have never before experienced this level of professionalism. I applaud Mr. Bryant and RIM Properties.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c3664531b37565:0xd788579c0ac25181< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

I've lived at Desert Luna for over 5 months now, and I can truly say that these are some of the most beautiful apartments in the High Desert! My husband and I searched for a year in the Tri-City area, but the apartments were all disgustingly dirty and were falling apart. RIM Properties really does take care of their apartments, and it definitely shows. Even maintenance requests I've had have been taken care of promptly. All staff members have been incredibly welcoming to us, and I can only suggest giving them a chance. Thank you RIM Properties!<//Text>

<review>Rim Properties has been for me as a tenant the very best experience i have had. I've always felt connected to their staff through request I've have made and the maintenance team which services its residents promptly. Where else could you get free cable, internet, trash, cold water...attached garages at most of the 15 different properties, which includes a washer and dryer hook-up and a community washer and dryer at most properties. We have back yards, carports outside our apartments, which allows personal parking in 2 areas...carport and garage. Rim Properties maintains there properties with gardeners that come once a week. There's also a children's play area and soccer field at one of the properties. Rim Properties covers all needs and that's why i intend to live here till my dying day.<//review>< Gmap_id>

If you come in expecting a certain price... think again... this place is so overpriced for what they offer. Look elsewhere. They may lure you in by being cheaper than other places, but guaranteed, if your not on a 1 year lease or something, you rent is going up starting at about 6 months after your move in.< /review>

<Text>I moved into the desert springs community in oct 2018, and all I can say is that the place is clean don’t get me wrong but I stay getting three day notices because of my music when by law I can have my music playing until 10pm everyday. I do know the law. I wouldn’t recommend rim properties to anyone well at least not the community I live in. I’ve had to put my speakers away because apparently if I get another noise complaint from the people that live next door to me my family and I have too move. So after my lease is up I will no longer live in this community. So horribly sad because it’s clean and has parks for my child to play but it’s not worth being able to play music oh yeah I’ve had the cops called on twice because of my music smh this isn’t an old folks home.< /Text>< pics>

<Time>1550625462142</Time><rating>1<//rating><text>I'm so upset right now with this place. I have referred so many people to live to here and I will never ever do it again I will tell them to RUN.

I moved in almost 3 years ago and have had nothing but issues. Let's first say, I was told I was getting z 2 bed room, only to be told the next day they gave my apartment away becasue someone came in with a deposit. I had my deposit, they told me to being it in Friday! So I had to break that news to my daughter.

Then a few months go by and a man comes knockin on my door claiming to by FBI looking for a woman they are investigating supposedly . He had no I'd, no card no nothing, apartments didnt do anything about it and the woman he was asking about was very disturbed and scared by him.

Then another incident were a man who we later found out was 50/51 kept approaching my door while It was just me and my young daughter there. Asking strange things about recent residents, asking if I wanted to drink with him or take him to the library. I even walked out one morning taking my daughter to school and he was RIGHT THERE! It was 7 am ! I reported this to these apartment and they promised they would have extra security and all. It NEVER HAPPENED! and then this year, my car got stolen. It was a friends car actually who had just left and within hours the car was stolen. I called the apartments once again becasue no others persons car was touched just ours and now my daughter is scared, I'm scared and I have a 1 year old now. I told the apartments I feel like I have been being watched, I'm uncomfortable,  and i dont feel safe here AT ALL and neither does my daughter. She is terrified! I told them all of this and all they can do is say I'm sorry and they will send out more patrol.

Once again a lie they dont have any form of security at all, no camera no nothing.

I asked that my family and I be relocated to another complex and RIM PROPERTIES owns multiple apartment complexes in the high desert.
There response was, becasue j was late in rent once, MY FAMILY AND I CANNIT TRANSFER! we make well over the amount to transfer to any unit but they will not allow it.
They give you until the 5th of every month to pay rent which is when we get paid. I dont ecen get off work until 6pm. They are telling my family that we have until 5pm on the 5th or it's considered late.
They are liars! Its NOT in my contract I have until 5 pm. And I have always done this and now all of a sudden we want to relocate due to security measures and they wint allow us to do so. This is bs!

They do monthly inspections and will look over your balcony and will give you a 3 day notice if they see things they dont like even though it cannot be seen to the public it. It's a form of harrassment and an invasion of privacy.

I started off loving this place and now I fear it. Rent has went up the lagl amount of times they are allowed to raise rent yearly and according to them its becasue the provide a nice safe friendly environment.

I dont feel like they care about my family and I at all! They dont care about my daughter nor my son and their safety. I will also share this review on the fb rental page as well for the area as that is usually were I suggest people look.into Rim Properties.  Never again. Just looking for the right home and homeowners or property management that actually understands family and values family and cares about the safety of others. I hope this review helps people considering this place. Thankful for a roof over my head, but I hate this place right now and feel I need to be armed to walk to my car or my door. Ugh<//text>< Pics>

<Text>The worst and I do mean worst customer service ever! Taryn the manager is completely incapable of the job she is assigned. She is totally unprofessional and disrespectful. I lived here for nearly 3 years and had my car stolen twice and home broken into before I finally said enough and moved out. Instead of offering help to me as the victim of there poorly managed properties, they made me feel like a criminal for moving out. No two people that work there  follow a set of rules, they all have different stories or rules. Amber is the only one with common sense, she is the onsite manager for Desert Island. Honestly she's to good of a person to work for a trifling place like Rim Properties. Amber has really great customer service skills and she really knows her residents that live at her community, unlike Taryn or any of the other office people. Alexis has no clue about anything, not sure why she's allowed to give out information, when clearly it's all wrong, let Taryn tell it. Michael Brent should be ashamed of how this family owned business is being ran into the ground. When asked for his number to complain about Taryn and the BS that's going on, I was told they didn't have a number for him. Well in that case I'll just Yelp and add reviews since I couldn't talk to anyone to resolve the issues I had. The internet can be awesome at times, this is one of those times. FYI, people really do read reviews when making decisions.  Customer service is key, it can easily make or break a business. This has been a complete nightmare!<//Text>< pics>

I was told there were none available but she did show me the apt in the picture. The counters are nasty and old , the bathroom is a joke ...it's like a hot water heater closet ...and the carpet is old and greasy .this apt looks like 1992 please update...not worth the money.

Please do not bring you pets or children it's not safe or clean.</text>

< Review>
This place deserves NO stars! The staff is incompetent and none of them know what the other is doing. Everytime you call in to find out the status of your application they give you a different story, everyday. Then the owner will call you and give you a different story regarding your application, as he was never shown it! They tell you they are fair housing but nothing about them is fair! We were told we were being approved for an apartment on November 3rd and find out that "Oh I'm sorry that apartment was rented first come first serve!". We had a conversation with the owner and the owner tells us on November 8th there is an apartment coming up on the 29th of November but tells us we have to pay 2x's the rent and we need to pay $300 holding deposit! I tell him ok we are for sure on this apartment and he tells us ok come in the morning and pay it, the holding deposit! I call in the morning and ask what we need to bring & I'm told a Cashier's Check or Money Order. I tell the staff we are putting a holding g deposit on the apartment for the 29th she tells me ok I'll put a 24 hour hold.
Meanwhile they still rent the apartment to someone else after telling us once again we can get that apartment!!! Every single bad review on here is all true! They lie to you from day one. And then drag you through the mud until they piss you off with their lies and bs!
Than tell you to Respect their staff!
At first I thought cool, the owner is cool and is actually doing his job than calls with some more bs after we waited 2 weeks for them to work on our file. We pushed our people to get paperwork done so we can rent a place here and they pull this bs. There is no way it took this long to get us approved!
They just didn't do their job& lied the whole time to my family and I.

DO NOT I REPREAT DO NOT RENT FROM THESE LIERS.</Review>

Only goto this place as a Last Resort. Bad staff miss write recipts  for lower amounts then makes you prove it this has happen to use a few times. If you have problem with your apartment it could take a month for them to get to you.They lie straight  to your face, we asked can we transfer is a smaller apartment becomes available they said they don't offer that. then the Property manager comes and tell us they do and have done so in the past. They staff mix up appartments all the times so careful you don't get someone else's problem or dues. Don't bother asking for a manager, in there eyes everyone is a manager. DONT DO IT<//review>

< Review>
My family and I are residents @ one of the Rim Properties. We looked around for a long time in the high desert, and this is by far the best we found. The staff is pleasant, and easy to talk to. The porperty is always clean, and is great for taking our small family on walks. We found EVERYTHING we were looking for in this property. The one small issue we had was addressed by the owner directly in a VERY professional manner. This showed me that the owner is directly invloved with the satisfation of his tenants.

They are way to strict with their "rules". I.e. Don't get any oil stains on concrete driveway.
Rent keeps going up but no improvements to property. I still get lakes in the house when it rains, inches of dust blows in through cracks under doors, in short there's no weatherproofing.</Text>

<review>WOST PLACE TO RENT
I wish I could give them no stars.
Let me start by saying the managers I had to deal with are all big liars. Always have an excuse why they don't return you're call and messages. From the beginning its been unprofessional, but I gave them a try because I was refer to them. But worst decision I have made.
1st.. I had to chase after them for pretty much everything, from did you get my husbands employment verification to let me see the apartment I was moving in. I saw it just three days before my moving in date. At one point I called to see if I could see the apartment, they  would just pick up the phone and hanging up. And at one point a man answered, said hello and hang up on me. So when I told the manager she claim that she doesn't have a male working for her, but when I came to talk to her for the 1st time she introduced me to her assistant manager and guess what it was a male. But she doesn't have a male working for her. BS
2nd.. Once I was moved in, maybe like 4 days I had an issue with the sower doors. I called and left a message to the manager on site and of course no phone call was returned. So I went to shower and of course the shower door fell on me. Thank GOD it was not on my 10 month old baby. So I called main office and they also had an excuse why the manager didn't returned my call. " they close the office at noon" always an excuse with them, but she did send someone Monday morning. But a bit too late I still have the soreness on my forehead where the door fell on me. to this day I haven't heard anything from my onsite manager if the door got fix and if I'm ok. And it's been 5 days. It shows what kind of people they have working for them.
3rd.. I was talking to one of the manager when I signed the rental agreement, I told her if I needed an extra week to move in if the amount for the fallowing month would change and she said yes and said "but for right now I'm putting the 12th."  So now that I called to change it she claims she never told me that. So another lie.... They are very nice until you move in to their properties. As an professional myself (dental office manager), this is not the way to do business.. If you say something you need to honor what you said. Even if you don't remember saying it. What happen to the customer is always right.
4th.. They are quick to tell you if anything is damage by the time you move out they will charge you $22 an hrs for anything that needs fixing. Of course they would charge that much when it's you're husband doing the work, and let me tell you I've seen better work done in construction than what's done to this apartments... They just paint over everything, witch the guy that came to fix my shower door told me.
SO AGAIN WORST PLACE TO LIVE AND RENT</review><user_name>Monica Gomez<//user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

After moving out and speaking with one of the owners I have decided to edit my review. There were some issues with other residents and the neighboring people that had to be addressed by the local police,  and we had some communication issues with the office and the property manager but in the end it was not a bad experince.<//Text>

<Review>I love this center. The open house event was enlightening. I enjoyed the speakers and the message of building bridges and having respect for all fellow Americans. I encourage people to visit the center specially during the Friday sermons and hear the learned Imaams and scholars. Love the community events and the environment as a whole.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

It's a🥀beautiful🌷 and wonderful ☪️Islamic🌹community CENTER located in the HEART of🥀San Diego. Its HUGE parking lot gives you an idea what I'm talking about.

- It provides variety of programs for all age groups.🥀Open house🌹 programs are excellent🌷 !.

- 🥀Prayer Hall🌹 is quite big, but very quiet. No road or FREEWAYS' noises in and out. Shoe-rack and restroom areas are very well-organized and very clean. I would consider it as the BEST👍and well organized Muslim community CENTER in San Diego.

- 🥀Ramadan programs🌹and Monday evening speeches of İmam Taha Hassane are just wonderful👍!. Sheikh Saif, the Masjeed's imam, is a young, wonderful, soft-spoken and nice person who is full with wisdom👍. He'd answer any questions you may have.
🥀Thank you for the excellent job you do🌷!. Keep up the good work !.👍🥀🌹🥀 )).</review>

Haters who don't know anything about these people or their big heart can say anything. Love is what makes real islam tick. Forget what you see on tv from fanatics. they are 3 or 4,000 in the world out of 3 billion muslims.<//text>

I pretty much also get a blended toffee coffee with swirls and whip. It is delicious, sweet and hits the spot if I want a sweet coffee treat in the afternoon.
I've also gotten hot chocolate from here and it is also delicious! Perfect for overcast, chilly days!<//review>

<Text>Used to love this place now the girls working don’t even talk to you they just talk about their issues with each other. I came through with my kids and was very close to just leaving because of the recent conversations and outfits I’ve been hearing and seeing. Bring the old girls back at least they cared and talked to us. Especially the girl that used to be in the mornings. It isn’t the same without them and I know I’m not the only one that will not be coming back here.< /Text><pics>None< /pics></record>

<text>Used to love this place. Lindsey was lit the best. Then girl named Marissa started working here and she for one never gets the order correct.

But then this happened... . I was there with my husband... Marissa was wearing a pair of the shortest shorts that literally showed half her a** cheeks. While she was making our coffee she bent over in front of the window and just stood there provocatively and even kept adjusting her clothes and squirming around..... I couldn't believe it.  My husband even commented, "what was up with her"....
Someone needs to address that girl and tell her to dress appropriately for work.
The young man before us was at the window for 15 minutes while she flirted with him.

We don't need high school mentality for our once fav coffee shop. Someone please tell that girl to grow up and to dress/work with some poise and sophistication.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1540671988994, 'text': 'I apologize that this happened-I do have a dress code and I will make sure that everyone is clear on it- thank you for bringing this to my attention-'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

I never leave negative reviews but I was also shocked like the woman below about the new prices.
I could go to Totem coffee on main street and get a delicious small mocha for literally two to three dollars less than Bean Barn.
The girls working at Bean Barn mentioned that the owner has increased all of the prices (again) on all of their drinks.
Ive always loved Bean Barn and it always seemed like a lovely local customer friendly atmosphere with really good prices BUT unfortunately this is no longer the case.

I really do hope that the owner sees some of these reviews and re-thinks her pricing to match both demographic and location. We are not in the Bay Area and we are very limited in where we can get good coffee. As a small town... We should not be taken advantage of in that way 😔

For now.... I will be at Totem 🗿 ☕< /review>

Very neat and accessible spot. They provide large portions and for inexpensive rates. I enjoyed the food a lot and the staff were very welcoming and explanatory. Recommended.</Review>

<Review>The food was great. Wish they would have given me everything that I paid for:( ordered at 4:58 today 10/5/20 Was told 25 mins for my pick up. Got there 5:30 and was told 5 mins more. 5:40 I got my food. Was told over the phone $17+ when I got there it was $19.90. Asked for the receipt and she couldn't find it and she looked through the trash can for it. I get home and my rice is missing. Called and all she said "my bad" and if I wanted to go back and grab it lol!😖</Review>< Gmap_id>

Been here a few times now. Most of the food is delicious but I personally find that the taste and even the kind of meat ( tender or size) is inconsistent. Minus one star for that. The gentleman who is usually in there is great and you feel like going back but sometimes there is a younger lady in there and she is RUDE. Made me feel like she was doing me a favor by giving me the food I PAID for. Even took the order really rudely. Haven't been back for a minute now!</Review>

We stopped in for our weekly dinner out and this was a good choice. It was suggested while at work this week and what a great suggestion.

The service was good and the food was excellent.

We ordered: Chicken Tikka (dry, not wet), Sag Paneer (medium spicy), and Chana Masala (spicy).

The Chicken tikka was cooked perfectly and it was tender and served still sizzling; SOO good.

The Sag Paneer was super flavorful.

The Chana Masala was out of this world and not too spicy.

Everything was cooked fresh and it showed. We left full, not overly full, and very satisfied. Oh yeah we even got some Barfi for the house; Very fresh.

If you like Indian food give this place a shot you should be pleased.

I have something confusing to report.
Ordered Chicken Vindaloo today and it was made with some Chicken AND some Potato's? Like 3 pieces of chicken and 5 pieces of potato. Hrmm.<//review>

My wife and I were greeted in an unfriendly manner... But who cares how we were treated... The food was excellent and that is what matters.. The serve was a good size... Love spicy level of food while my wife enjoyed medium level of spiciness... The front desk lady forgot to pack fork, spoon and napkins.
The food is great... The service m not really sure.... I would definitely recommend to try the Vindaloo Chicken...< /Review>

I placed an order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes, got there, and had to wait another 25 minutes. The girl in the front was extremely rude, she was on her phone and told me I was *too* early to get the food even though I arrived exactly when she told me. She was gossiping in Punjabi about customers. They made fun of someone who placed an order over the phone, which was really disrespectful. The workers in the back were not wearing a mask and you could hear them talking to one another while making food. The girl in the front just sat on her phone and made no attempt to make sure I got my food on time. The rice they gave me was extremely undercooked, to the point where you could break a tooth. I’ve never had an experience like this but next time Livingston or Ceres would be worth the drive. I’d recommended hiring a new person in the front.<//review>

Food was good but took very long to bring to us.
The short girl with the shorter length hair working the counter seemed more distracted with her phone & gossiping with her coworker then to greet us when we walked in to order. Her tone of voice & mannerisms came across very rude & arrogant. Punjab express owner needs to hire better employees or train the current ones on professionalism.<//text>

Girl in front counter wearing mask halfway. Not even covering nose. Co workers just sitting around like they don't care about customer like it's last day on job. Terrible service. Today was my final straw.  This place slowly lost all my trust.< /Text>

Please replace the short girl at the front counter. Made my family feel unwelcome & talked rudely. I didn't not even bother to place the rest of the order We walked out and went to an Indian restraunt in ceres. Hope the owner reads this. You are losing customers based on all the other negative reviews. I also noticed the positive reviews with generic names posting the same exact thing. They have be fake accounts to keep their ratings high.<//text>

< Review>
I ordered 2 chicken ticca tandoori style I had Requested that the chef spice it up a bit with some tomato spice or ketchup. I instructed the girl who took my order of the chef can make it spicy by putting a little tomato base to the onion and bell peppers so the meat is not 2 dry and we can have a little kick of flavor. I have had it made at other restaurant all around the us millions of times so I requested if they can make it this way. The girl on the phone sad sure and told my my order will be ready in 30 min. My brother picks up the order when he brought it home. When I was about to serve it to my guest I saw they did not add any spice to it the ch was extra dry. I called and the female was really rouse and told me they don’t make it that way and I asked her why didn’t she just say that or checked with the chef when i was placing the order. I wouldn’t have ordered it. She starts to argue and when I asked to speak to the owner she told me to come to the restaurant. And I explained to her in Punjabi dnd English that I have guest over I need to talk to him on the phone. Then she told me he’s not at the restaurant. She clearly lied to me and then continued to argue with me on the phone. Keep in mind I didn’t ask for a refund even once. I just felt really disappointed and hurt. I can’t believe how this female treated me A paying customer who just wanted to complaint to the owner or manager and all I wanted was them to know they made a mistake so they don’t do this to anyone else. My night was round we ended up not even eating the chicken ticca. I grow up in the restaurant field and know how to  lol everything my self I just wanted to be lazy and order out and I had the worst experience ever the food was really bad and the service was the worst on top of it. I think this place needs to train Their employees on customer service and If you want to have customer who will return to your restore you should teach that female some manners. Once again like I sad before they made a mistake I just wanted them to realize it and fix it if possible I don’t want a refund. But that female’s behavior and tone of voice on the phone rounded my experience and my day. I will never order from There again ever. I hope the owner sees this and can actually fix his staffs problem.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>First no one would answer the phone so I double checked on Google to make sure they were open. When I got their the girl didn't greet us & from what it sounded like she was watching some sort of Indian sitcom on her phone. Customers should always come first not your phone. I did place order for butter chicken &.naan & she said it would be about a 30 minute wait. So I go to Walmart to pass some time & come back and the food still wasn't ready. She goes to the side glass door to ask the cooks & comes back to tell me it would be another 15 minutes wait. I wasn't angry & I understand the restraunt industry. I waited the 15 minutes and finally received my food. I opened the box their in front at the counter & the  naan was burnt on the sides. I asked for a refund for the entire order & the girl raised her tone of voice saying that it is the way naan is cooked. Ive had naan before and it's supposed to be slightly golden never black & burnt. I just felt frustrated beginning to end otherwise I wouldn't of asked for the refund. I don't recommend this place.<//Review>< pictures>

Food is delicious, but they need to work on there customer service. My husband walks in for a pick up and the lady couldn't even say hi, instead she just dogged stared him. She was not polite at all, we didn't feel welcomed.< /review>

This place is very flavorful. And if u like spicy , u can ask for anything to be spicy and it packs a punch of heat and layers of flavors! So good , I tried it to go without knowing exactly what I was ordering and I was extremely happy with what I ordered. my s/o was resistant to new food and he loved it too. Highly reccomend this place for a flavor town trip.</Text>

Atmosphere is a generous 3/5 (not someplace I'd take my wife on a date night, would just order as take out.) but is ok as a quick dine-in. Cost is 4/5 (fair), not cheap but definitely not overpriced.

Do NOT take this review as a negative, but a comparison to other restaurants. It is a small "mom-and-pop" style. This is more of a niche establishment that gives the community a valuable unique choice when the age old question "what would you like to eat?" comes up. I should note that I've eaten here over a handful of times since 2019, and return often when I'm in the mood for Indian cuisine (but am too lazy to cook it). As an aside I've been an amateur chef for almost 20 yrs and can duplicate most dishes by taste alone (no recipe needed).

Try them out for yourself. Its definitely worth a taste if you're looking for something different.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>If you like authentic, good quality North Indian food, this is the place to be. The place is pretty basic but the food is great. We ordered samosa chole with chai(which came in nice ceramic cups) as a starter and some main course. The first bite was so good that we ordered more appetizers and took our ordered food to go 😁.  I will definitely go there again when I visit town.<//Text><UserId.>103516742781400562698<//UserId.>< gmapID>

I like this place, the food is delicious. The sign reads that this is north Indian food and it is delicious and the price is good. I usually stick with the curry lamb or curry chicken with the garlic nan. Oh man, the garlic nan delicious. I hope this place lasts. Oh they also sell many sweets, but I am not familiar with all the sweets.</review>

OMG, YASSSS. The food was so flavorful! Made my bf try it, we ordered spicy masala and koma chicken and garlic naan bread and it was so good. I love spicy and it brought the heat I love and balanced with such flavor at the same time. Was such a good meal. I highly reccomend. I hadn't even tried what I ordered before, I ordered blind and I was not disappointed.< /Text>

First off, the food is AWESOME! We’ve tried most of Indian restaurants in Modesto & I think it’s the best Indian food in the Modesto/Turlock area. Only downer is sometimes it takes a long time to get the entres; yet, it is Worth the wait. 2 thumbs up.<//Review>

<review>First time trying Indian food, came here to take lunch to work for myself and coworkers since they recommended here. The cashier looked like a young teen who hardly spoke English. I asked a question about a food on the menu and he wrote it down on his notepad as if I ordered it. Long story short, they forgot a container of rice in my bag and the cashier forgot to add utensils and napkins until I requested them.  But I won't let this place give me the wrong impression that Indian food service is bad elsewhere.</review><gmap_id>0x80910773782224ff:0xd31699a7caaf541d<//gmap_id></record>

I am so happy I stumbled upon Punjab Express. The food is sensational. Full of flavor. One of the things I love about them is they have take out orders. Service is always good. Very friendly and welcoming. If you are looking for some good Indian dishes at a good price with excellent flavor I highly recommend Punjab Express.< /Text>

I think the food was great! I order mild and was mild, curry chicken masala and the homemade bread. Delicious combination. I love it! Why not 5 stars? Because I don’t like the TVs in food places. Food delicious, kind services and reasonable prices. Thanks!</Text>

<Text>Food is terrific here. They have some of the best Korma I have ever had. Edit 7/19: they updated the interior, and it is a quiet and good looking place to eat now too. Really though, good food.
Bonus points if you can spot the lady in the green green dress more than once.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Their good is pretty good. Avoid calling in orders as theres often a language barrier, misunderstanding, hanging up the phone or rudeness (maybe a cultural difference).</review>

< Review>
The food was a bang for the buck. However there seemed to be a silent argument between the server that would rather mingle  around with other guests rather than serving us, and the lady that was constantly trying to get the server to do his job.

The overall dining experience was pretty bad but I would still recommend the food, if it's to go.
Also, don't install ceiling fans directly below the spotlights.<//Review>

<Review>I've been to this place twice. The food wasn't bad but what I didn't like was paying the tab then going home and looking at my bank account and seeing they charged me more than what I originally paid for not just once but twice. They're sneaky and i feel like they thought I was too dumb to notice. Not coming back again. One star<//Review>< pictures>

Ordered 4 orders of Tandori Chicken to-go,  and thought it was funny when the lady wouldn’t let us check our order. Then we got home and figured out while....the chicken smelled ROTTEN! They cooked rotten chicken, and when I mean rotten, our family gathering of mine all smelt it to try and figure out if it was rotten, and you could clearly smell that half the order was rank. Hoping those of us that ate a couple of pieces before we figured it out don’t end up in the hospital.</review></record>

<review>I love Indian food and this place is so great  to get it! You can come here with friends or dine alone and it's awesome! My favorites are the butter chicken and (when you can get it, sometimes they don't have it) the mango lassi and the garlic naan bread. On point. Also they have candies! 💖< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Every time we go here we ask for 4 orders of Naan (8 pieces) . We clearly explain that we want 8 pieces. When I go and pick up the order I ask again if they put in 8 pieces. The guy always says "yes". We never end up getting them.

Yesterday, I I took the time to open the bag and take a look. I complained and said that there was only 4 pieces. The guy said he would correct it and took the naan back into the kitchen as they forgot.
When I got it back I checked and it "looked" like there was more pieces.
When I got home and got ready to eat, I noticed he simply cut the previous pieces of naan in half.
The food's good but that was just straight up a dick move.< /Review><date>1516498296777</date><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Amazing food for a great price. Best Indian place in Turlock. The servers are quiet, which some people could see as rude, but we have been there several times, and they are really nice! Definitely recommend.< /review>

<text>We stopped at Punjab express on the way back from Yosemite to bay area. We reached there 30min before closing. The service was good. Shahi paneer and chole were prepared fresh and served. The taste and quality of food was better than any restaurant in bay area. Price was also very reasonable.<//text></record>

We were looking for good Indian food and we were not disappointed. It's cozy and not overly decorated. We ordered chicken biriyani, Saad Paneer, butter chicken and garlic naan. We were very delighted with the flavors. Well be back again.</Review>

<Review>The place was Dusty, I cleaned it myself.dust in the closet and along the edge of the closet, the fridge was not defrost I couldn't close the door of the fridge... but yes I manage to do so. I'm a woman who's been married to a military man at the age of 15yr.and one thing about the military we are organized, this is my second marriage of 24yrs.and he is a truck driver and that's where we were two weeks ago, oh' I asked for another sitting chair so that my husband and I would be able to sit while we would have dinner together, and not him or I sitting on the bed.yes I asked for another chair the manager said no,huh as much money my husband spent there I don't see why we couldn't have another chair.the end.thankyou for reading and listening to my story.<//Review>< Pics>

This was one of the poorest ones. I made the reservation on hotels.com and someone from the Motel 6 called me around 5pm to see if I was still coming. Hotels.com would have charged me whether I showed up or not and yet here they were trying to give my room away to someone else and get money from that too. Not appreciated! We told them we were arriving very late and asked them not to give our room away.

We arrived late, around 230am, and the lobby was closed. Had to go up to the night window. Thought this was just because it was so late, but no, it was like this the whole time. It was challenging to have to communicate thru a night window my entire stay.

Room was ok, nothing special. The bathroom sink was broken and the water was barely dripping out of it. I had to bend over and use the tub water to wash my face. So annoying!

We had reserved two nights and the first morning we left and explored the Sequoia National park. We came back to the hotel exhausted and were unable to get into our room. Our key had not been setup correctly. I had to go to the night window again and explain I needed to get back into my room, that I had paid for. Also annoying!

There is a noisy train nearby. This is not a great neighborhood with lots of bums and sketchy characters nearby. We were in a room on the end which you would think would be quiet, but it was not.

To top it all off, the pool and the jacuzzi were closed. No reason given. I'm sure it was bs COVID fears even though every other hotel I've stayed at since this started has had theirs open. LAME and LAZY.

Meh. If I go to this town ever again I will find another place to stay.</Review></record>

If you expect luxury at a 2 star motel it's not going to happen. That being said, our stay last night was not too bad. All we were really looking for was a bed and a bathroom. They both were pretty decent except for mold in the shower. The bed was comfortable and we slept pretty well except for the noise neighbors at midnight. All in all we were mostly satisfied.<//text>

I had an ADA room and unfortunately it was not 100% clean when we checked in. There were blood smudges on the bathroom door and the shower chair. I had brought disenfecting wipes and wiped the whole room down upon arrival...so I didn't bring up the issue to thhe office. Stayed 3 nights comfortably, asked that housekeeping not come in as i had disenfected, and didn't want anyone in there after that. Overrall...good stay, I'd stay again.< /text>

<text>Booked a 2-queen room. I failed to change the number of guests to 2 when I booked it. Had to pay an extra $6 for a second person to use the other bed. Thought that strange. Didn’t I already pay more for 2 queens vs one? Why would they need more $$ for the second bed to be used?  Hmmmm.  I have to commend the desk clerk for contacting the person that parked his truck and trailer in front of our room (using 3 spaces) and had him move so we could park our loaded truck in front of our room.  Which, by the way, was not disturbed. Happy about the safety and security of the location.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8094e4231809ec03:0xe999725492ac9001<//gmapID></record>

The bathroom door wouldn’t close, you had to push it hard to get it closed. The drawers were broke. The bed was hard but over all it was fine for the one night.<//review>

< review>
So I've been to quite a few(a lot) motel 6 over
time. whether I book directly or third party but I've noticed a trend with the staff. whenever I have a complaint and I go to the front desk and say something they never reported to management. So the following morning at the time off check out there is no notes no comments nothing written down whatsoever.
For instance this time i got a broken tv huge crack down the middle, and not water pressure.< /review>

<text>Stayed at the Motel 6 in Kingsburg, Ca  Cancelled my stay there the 1st night because I found a cheaper place down the road...BIG MISTAKE!  The manager not only was able to cancel my stay at the last minute but also made sure we got the highest discount that was available!  Can't remember his name but for the 2 days we stayed there I saw him emptying the parking lot trashes and making sure the parking lot stayed clean!  Rooms were very clean and the area was very peaceful!  We'll definitely will stay there again 👍< /text>< Rating>

Positive: Location and price Negative: Room looked good until I opened microwave and it was filthy. Made me question how clean room really was during this covid-19 time. Motel 6 said they were follow safety guidelines and this just threw that out the window for me. Also no coffee</Text>

Just needed a room for the night, got it. Check in was fast and easy, and the manager was pleasant. Room is very basic and clean, but simple. It was a non- smoking room,  but cigarette smoke permeated everything. Nasty smell.<//text>

The room was very clean. However, the hair dryer is broken and there was no shampoo. Cigarette butts and other trash were in the stairs, walkways and parking lot. A little more housekeeping around the property would be great.<//text>

Same welcoming and helpful staff, new paint job looking really spiffy and a quiet comfortable night as always. I am happy to travel more miles at odd hours in business travel to stay at this location particularly. Having a fridge and microwave, and a jacuzzi as well as a pool doesn't hurt either I must admit.<//Text>

Outside of hotel and office appear clean and well cared for. First impression of the room was positive.  Pleasantly decorated and looked clean. But not enough time was spent cleaning the bath and vanity area. There was tooth paste spray on the frame of the mirror. Some rice or other food pieces were in the corner of the vanity. Worst was the shower that had grime on the walls and the non-slick surface of the tub. Also, the blow dryer did not work.</review>

<text>You get exactly what you pay for here: a clean bed, a private room, and hot running water in the shower. Parking is VERY cramped and limited. The place is close to the interstate, but traffic isn't bad at all. I had some problems with my keycard, and got prompt remedy. I was a bit concerned by the failure to check for ID when I asked for help but decided I didn't have the time or energy to stress over the potential ease with which a person could gain access to a different room.< /text>< user>

<review>Nice people running this 6.  Rooms are always clean and comfortable.  Motel is quiet at night and I always feel safe.  Neighborhood is safe looking and is off the freeway a little bit.

They have tried to upgrade the rooms with some wood furnishings. Desk, drawer unit, TV cabinet, etc.  Unfortunately they have been beat up with use and need some attention.< /review></record>

There costumer service is legit so awful. I requested a room with 2 beds and they gave me a room with 1 bed, I also requested to switch rooms but they were NOT able to change my room because I had “too much things” in my room. They also did not give me a my refund that I asked for. Also the two females working 1/25/2020 (evening shift)  were so disrespectful towards me n my fellow guest.<//text>

Cockroach in front of my door, Room smelled of  mildew and urine made both of our eyes water and allergies set in full mode. The stench of this room was so strong my  entire suitcase of clothes now smells like the room, can’t get away from it by checking out .Clothes hanging  device hanging off the wall almost fell on my head, red stains on bed comforter and window curtains, bathroom hairy toilet and shower with yellow dots on ceiling, I took pictures he wasn’t interested in and did not care about my stay. Because I scheduled with Expedia I was able to get a full refund but had to last min search for another hotel. Rude looks and service.<//text>< user_name>

It was such a fun place to stay!
Some things were broken, but not in a scary or unusable manner. You can tell the room is almost always occupied, but kept up as well as time permits. Shower and bath were fantastic! And the HD TV and channels made my kids day! Thanks so much for such a lovely time!<//Text>

At first glance, it was the best motel 6 we'd ever seen. But for the mattresses, would have given it 5 stars. Out of 4 adults, not one had a good rest on those mattresses. Room clean, staff friendly. Only complaint was backaches from the beds.<//Text>

<text>Friendly, efficient front desk.  Room was much more nicely furnished than most Motel 6s.  Microwave and fridge.  Large.  Two problems.  Bathroom sink had very little pressure yet drained poorly.  Internet kept going in and out.  Overall, as good or better than most of this chain.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

Stayed one night passing through the area. The pictures make it look very nice,but in reality it is older and poorly maintained and cleaned. The sheets on the bed were worn through and had some hairs on them. I was worried they were not clean so asked for a fresh set. The girl at the front desk quickly got them,which is why I am giving it more than one star.<//Review>

First off, the non smoking room smelled like a hotel casino in Las Vegas. The top cover on the bed had a nasty looking stain, nothing looked clean, marks on walls, bed skirts were all scuffed up, floor not swept, refrigerator had dirty shelves, tv had some chunks of who knows what on it, shower curtain was disgusting and worst of all, when I turned on the light in the morning... roaches!</Review>

The property is fairly unkempt and dirty. There was garbage in the parking lot and the stairs and balcony were sticky with old spills and food. The room was neat but smelled like it was a smoking room. I have allergies and it was not a pleasant stay for me. The room had no clock and the TV remote did not work well. Kingsburg is a clean, quiet little town and the Motel 6 did not fit in with it's surroundings. I will be staying in the area almost everyday for the next 18 months for a project but I will be staying at a cleaner hotel. The staff was friendly but that is pretty much the only positive I have to report.<//Review>

Clean, warm ADA sleeping area.  Comfortable bed. Close ADA parking.

Edges of bed were too soft and made me feel like I would slip off.  I had to sleep closer to the center of the bed to avoid feeling like I would fall out of bed.

Bathroom mirror only worked for someone in a wheelchair.  Bathtub was slippery and had no grab bar at the foot of the tub to help entry and exit.  No counter with the sink to put anything on.< /Text>

The owner of this place was so rude mean worst human being I've ever crossed pathes with. I even saved  his life from a homeless man who was beating him up in front of my room the owner was on the floor with 1 shoe knocked off him bloody knees hands cut on his head broken glasses had I not stopped the homeless guy from beating him up he probably would have ended up in the hospital.  The homeless guy even hit me for trying to stop him I am a small woman & put myself in harm's way for this ballers coward yet he never even thanked me I have got video from other guests there so stay tuned on GB to see this coward scream like a little girl< /review>

Dirty, dingy, falling apart. Cob webs on ceiling. Greasy fingerprints on inside of entry door. Shower curtain falling out of wall. A/C noisy and shorting out. Hairs all over walls in shower gross! I have photos to prove I’m not just picky.</Text>

The room was clean and the staff was very nice. The A/C didn't work the best so the room was stuffy but still a nice decent place to stay. Would stay again if needed.< /Review>

Had to rent room because apartment complex was fumigating for termites. Reserved 2 rooms a month ahead explained that husband worked nights and we would need early check-in and late check-out. Didn't get into room until almost 10/10:30. Manager tried to be helpful. His wife, not so much. Our floors were dirty and the bedskirts were stained along with the lampshades. The headboard had white drippy spots on it. The desk chair was covered in white stains. Cobwebs in bathroom. Ac was noisy but super cold. The plug next to ac is uncovered and a fire hazard. Fridge/freezer was clean but needs to be defrosted. Microwave turntable didn't work and that may be a hazard. Upstairs railing deadly if you lean on it. Sheets had holes in them. Towels were clean and the cleaning staff let me dispose of our trash and exchange towels. Went to check on daughter at night, looked up and saw cockroaches on the ceiling. Paid for extra night because couldn't check out late. But left by 5 pm on extra night we still had. Will not go back, even though pets stay free. Will pay extra to stay somewhere else.< /Text>

I stayed there for two nights. The room was disgusting.  Looked like it has NEVER been dusted.  The furniture was filthy and the bath tub was terrible. I lThe walls looked like someone had thrown up on them and left it there.  There was spider webs with a spider in the corner above the dirty mirror. Every corner of if the room had control webs.  The floor looked like it hadn't been swept in along time. The one time I walked across the floor bare foot the bottom of my feet were black. The fridge was disgusting and the microwave had no plate in it.  I went and bought a bottle of disinfectant and cleaner and dusted  the furniture and the Bathtub and wiped down the walls my self.  The bed skirt looked like it had never been cleaned.  I didn't even unpack any of my clothes Cause  the drawers had dirt and sand in them. The head board was so dusty and sticky. After I cleaned the room it didn't look too bad the rooms definatley need to be repainted. I was so disgusted and surprised at the mess I took pictures of everything.  For the price that was paid I shouldn't have to come and clean. A room before I was comfortable to stay in it.  From the out side it is very nice and the managers seemed like good people. They need to replace them housekeeping staff and inspect each room individually. Not somewhere I would pay to stay again.< /review>

There was thick dust all over the room. The hairdryer did not work and when I called the front desk to complain the Man was rude. Check out was at 11 am. They started knocking at the door at 10:15. The front desk called at 10:40 saying it was time to leave. Very unsatisfied!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Everything was great for our 2 night stay. Only a few suggestions. First our room key would not work all the time or at all the second day because it wasn't registered for 2 nights. Second was the freezer was completely frosted with 3 water bottles stuck inside so we could not put our frozen foods in there. Third, the floor was VERY dirty. It seems as if it had not been mopped in quite some time. Other than those items everything else was very pleasant.</Review><Name>Tim Chilepa<//Name>< date>

For a Motel 6...
It is one of the better ones I've had the opportunity to visit. Approaching the site, the area surrounding the motel is clean and graffiti free. Sure it's right next to Route 99, but I was in Rm 103 on the bottom, it was quite. The only thing I heard was the freight train rolling thru town at 3a. I'm quite certain that had I not been awake,  I never would have heard it. There are numerous places to eat both sit down and fast food within walking distance. I was on company business,  I will be back.</Text>

<Text>This is one of the cleanest Motel 6 I have stayed in. We travel all over the US and I've stayed in many and I know a clean room when I see one. The beds are comfortable and clean, bathroom, floors and mirrors are clean, and the people there are friendly. The only bad thing I found in the last room we stayed in the fridge wasn't working. It's right across from Mc Donald's and other restaurants. You should also try and visit Salazars Mexican food it's right behind the motel it has great food.< /Text>< UserId.>

Please know that we are on high alert regarding this issue and are mindful to monitor our rooms in order to address, treat and terminate any issues if we discover them. We have designed a thorough and strict procedure to address all complaints or potential issues within our hotel. Unfortunately, bed bugs are a world-wide problem and present a unique challenge due to their highly transient nature, traveling easily in luggage and clothing. This is why we continually train our housekeeping staff to proactively monitor all guest rooms for the potential presence of bed bugs and have standing contracts with professional exterminators to treat affected areas in case any are discovered on our premises. No room get released until we have and all-clear from them. Please contact our guest relations department to better address this situation: 1-855-787-9864.

Check In Rep went out of her way to find us a room on the first floor as my wife has a problem climbing stairs.   We usually book early and can request it but due to our travel plans could not this time.

Of course we always like the free dog stays.</Review>

<text>The room was exstreamly dirty,its like a junky hotel you see in movies. My sheets had yellow stains, there were human hairs in the bed,sink and shower.
There was a lot of dust and empty snake wrapper under the bed. We asked to switch rooms and the second room was no better! Still human hair, stained sheets and discsting stiki floors. They haven't even changed the T.P from the last guest-all we got were 5 squares... BOUNES: you can hear your neighbors threw the thin walls and the train honking every 60 min. Eventually we couldn't take it anymore and cheackd out at 5AM.<//text><UserId.>118384855574835484567< /UserId.><Response>{'time': 1518023386721, 'text': 'Dear Guest, Thank you for your feedback.

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I booked a room on the website; found a coupon code for a little extra savings! This location is right off the freeway. The guy in the office, Harry, was very friendly and welcoming! The room was clean and the showerhead was freakin' AWESOME!! A really good showerhead makes all the difference for a good, relaxing hot shower. The showerhead in my room was so good, I wanted to take it home with me! I tried to stand on the edge of the tub so I could see the brand name so I could buy the exact one when I got home, but no luck. Overall, my stay was pleasant and I plan on staying at this Motel 6 again in the future.</Review>< Pics>

My room seemed cleaned, but it has a bad smell.
Although, I booked my room almost a week earlier, they gave me an upstairs room. They told me that the downstairs rooms were all taken by people who are re-staying in these rooms.< /Review>

It seemed clean and everything but the bathroom door did not close and the shower curtain was really thin. To the point Water would go right through. Also there so no over head fan in bathroom.</text>

Would never recommend to anyone. Room was a filthy mess. Stains on walls, light switches, floors not even swept or mopped, could visible see black in corners on floors. Shower head had rust, microwave was missing plate, had to kill a cockroach while we were in the room. Most disgusting motel 6 I have ever stayed at, they should be ashamed. Health dept, needs to shut them down. Get new owners and start over. Ice machine was just as gross.<//Review>

{'time': 1493927789469, 'text': 'Dear Abraham, We take bed bugs reports very seriously and sincerely apologize for your experience. Please know that we are on high alert regarding this issue and are mindful to monitor our rooms in order to address, treat and terminate any issues if we discover them. We have designed a thorough and strict procedure to address all complaints or potential issues within our hotel. Unfortunately, bed bugs are a world-wide problem and present a unique challenge due to their highly transient nature, traveling easily in luggage and clothing. This is why we continually train our housekeeping staff to proactively monitor all guest rooms for the potential presence of bed bugs and have standing contracts with professional exterminators to treat affected areas in case any are discovered on our premises. No room gets released until we have and all-clear from them. Please contact our guest relations department at 1-855-787-9864 to better address this situation. Thank you again for bringing this issue to our attention.'}< /resp>

<Text>The room and bathroom were clean however the toilet seat was loose and there was a hole in the wall where the door stopper was busted out but not repaired.
TV remote didn’t work well so we had to manually change channels.
We reserved a room for four adults and was given only three towels so we had to request more.
We were traveling with two small dogs and the property did not have a area for them.< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>Sun Ridge Nail Spa is absolutely worth it!! The girls are super nice and very accommodating to what you request of them. I got my nails done using dipping powder by Hana. She was very meticulous about having each nail the same length and in the same shape as well. The colors looked great and they were nice and shiny.

I showed her a colour that I wanted on my phone and she went searching through the store to find the right colour for me! That's what I call customer service. Even though she was very careful, she finished within 60 minutes.

I would definitely recommend calling in advance to book an appointment. The store gets quite busy, especially on weekends.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORXwlKGKbsDFFMzlnObXtjGnhGayWrjBQjiMdB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

First you walk in and they don’t say anything. I had a appointment and there was only one other person getting there nails done while there was 4 other workers. I wanted to get a fill. Then they don’t make you wash your hands they don’t say anything about it they just tell you sit down. I just put hand sanitizer on in my purse. I think if things like this are gonna be open they need to have a strict clean policy and still be good on timely manner. I finally sat down to get my nails done an hour after my appointment.< /Review>

I took my daughter there to get a manicure. The nails looked awful . There was glue stuck to all of the nails and they looked so cheap looking. They all started popping off later that night and the next day. Also, it was extremely expensive, $50. We will NEVER go back. Poor quality and a rip off!<//Text>

<Text>Always have great service when I get a pedicure and nails filled. Beware at certain times as the yoga place is now open next store and it won't be a relaxing experience. Plan on hearing the walls move with very loud music while you are there when class is going on next door. I will definitely not go during those times as it was so annoying that I left with a headache.<//Text>< pictures>

Decent place to get your nails done. They're quick and reasonably priced. Lots of comfy pedicure chairs too, if that's your thing.< /review>

Great experience and great shop! So glad they opened up, especially so close to home. Best salon I’ve been to in Rancho< /review>< user_id>

Hit or miss. Pretty expensive. They typically charge me 40$ for just a fill.
They typically take over an hour and half.
One time the girls argued with me about the color polish I wanted..... I dunno... One time I went and had a lady named Rachel and she was great. But I've been back several times since and it's been a sour experience everytime so I will not be coming back.
I really hoped it would be nice cause of the area and ambiance but very disappointing.
Hope this helps someone to not throw their money away 💅 😔< /review>

I went to this shop for convenience; but will now drive a greater distance  for quality and professional  work ethics. My gel manicure only lasted for 2 days before  chipping. I went back to the shop to get a repair.  The shop owner told me to go home and put glue on them myself.  After ignoring her rude  comment; she begrudgingly  filed my nails down, placed glue and a quick brush of polish on my nails.  I'm guessing this shop makes a million  dollars per day; and not at all worried for returning  satisfied  customers.<//review>

Went there when it was slightly busy on a Sunday with my two friends. Got a manicure, but didn't get nice treatment. The older gentleman I believe is a manager barely cut my cuticles, didn't smooth the end of my nails so they catch on everything, and gave a minute massage to one hand then a quick swipe on the other. Then he told me to 'go away now'. I went and sat with my friend, who had a very nice girl who did a great job.
Just watch out for the older gentleman usually manning the cash.< /Text>

First visit was on a busy thursday afternoon but was helped right away with no appointment. I got a gel manicure, pedicure & eyebrows waxed. The girls were friendly and did a good job, I will be going back. They prefer cash and have an ATM inside next to the cash register.<//text>

Was not happy with my experience. They took an exaggerated time to finish my nails and the product of it was more than disappointing. Not only did my nails not look right they cut my finger which is just horrible. Wouldn't recommend. Nice chandeliers though.</review>

This place is awful.  The technicians completely ignored my daughter and I while talking to each other.  We waited with our feel in water for 20 minutes and instead of focusing on their work they talked to each other and took 40 mins to paint my daughters toes. Not a pedicure, just paint!
When I try to talk to the owner or manager they will not connect me.  Sadly I will not return.  Very disappointing service and a waste of money.</Review>

Only because zero stars is not an option. This was an extremely unpleasant salon experience. They are disorganized and all over the place but the kicker was the young man who did my pedicure. He was angry about my color selection and proceeded to complain about it to other staff. Will not be spending my money and especially my time at this unprofessional salon that is intended to relax and pamper.<//review>

<text>I wouldn't recommend this place. I was excited to see a nail salon open up in my neighborhood but I would much rather drive a little ways for a better experience.

I asked for a mani and peti. They got me started on the mani and sold me on getting the dip powder which is supposed to last longer. My clear coat started peeling the following day. When you ask for a mani you assume you are getting the full treatment. Well they only gave me the "polish change" treatment. Did not remove my cuticles or shape the nails. Not impresses at all.

When I was getting my peti done the worker who was working on a customer next me to was talking to the guy working on my nails about one of the other customers in the store. They proceeded to talk negatively to me and the customer next to me about a different customer in the salon and how she is being too picky. I think that is very unprofessional. I wanted to get out there as fast as I could. When I got home I noticed my toe polish looked like a 5 year old did it.

Never again!</text>< pictures>

So let’s start by saying, I couldn’t give it a zero, but if I could I would have. I origannly set up this appointment two weeks in advance and asked for the guy there that apparently is really good. I explained I had bad experiences in the past and had not had my feet or fills done in years and was going to a wedding and wanted a really good mani/pedi.

So I made the appointment for my niece and I. We arrived early. The people aren’t real friendly, I asked about the guy and they said oh you sit here without an explanation. So my niece decided she wasn’t going to have a mani/pedi. (Intuition I guess)

Let me explain that I am a below the  knee amputee so the pedi is one foot and a calf. The girl cut my cuticle and it bled. It hurt a little but I overlooked it since it’s been years since I’ve had a pedicure. They rubbed my foot and calf for about 15 minutes and put a couple super hot rocks and wax on my foot and called it a pedicure. They directed me to one of the nail desks.

The girl who was working on putting the nails on didn’t know what she was doing and she had to get someone else. The nails were ok but nothing spectacular, I go to pay and it was 92.00 dollars. They charged me 46.00 for 1 foot. When I asked the lady they only did one foot and would there be a discount, she claimed it took the same amount of time it takes for two feet. Really? She stuck to her guns and said it was $92.00.  I paid he $92.00 no tip I wasn’t expecting 1/2 off but not full price for doing nothing on the other leg that isn’t even there! Needless to say, the most powerful thing I can do as a consumer is stop consuming. Won’t ever recommend them or use them again.
Plus the foot they worked on, developed an itchy rash. I think the cuticle clippers weren’t new or autoclaved.< /text>

This is the worst nail service I've ever recieved!! the guy who did my color change was so rude when I couldn't pick my color. Usually people will suggest a color if you're having a hard time but he was just like "pick a color". Oh I'm sorry it's not like I'm paying you or anything! You don't have to have a full blown Convo but don't RUSH!<//text>

<review>I have been going to Peter for my haircut for 4 years.  My entire family also get their hair cut here.  All the stylists have good skills and take their time to give high quality cut.  I just got mine done today after 5 months since shelter in place.  Same high quality service and my hair looks much healthier and better!  Peter is very skilled and knowledgeable on hair care.   Let us support local business and get pampered with a great hair cut!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Two stars because they're usually nice, and definitely cheap, but you also get what you pay for. They did this to my boyfriend's hair, and the sideburns were uneven too (not pictured). Don't go if you have expectations for your hair!< /Review>

They are open during CoVID and are doing hair cuts outside. However I feel like they are a one trick pony. I have curly hair and asked for layers. They cut my hair in a bob with minimal layers so that "it won't get frizzy." It's the absolute worst haircut for my face and hair. I look like a 🌲.  I now have to wet my hair daily and put product in to tame it. It's probably a great place if you want a trim or have straight hair. Curly people avoid. But three stars for being open and doing an ok cut< /Text>

<text>It's been my place of choice since I moved to the Bay Area. They're courteous, warm and extremely capable. I don't know how their stylists are trained, but honestly each of them do such a fantastic job that I don't mind if my usual stylist is unavailable at times. The pricing is pretty normal for a salon of this size in Palo Alto</text>< Pictures>

I just had a men’s hair cut here. Jenny, the well dressed mid-aged women seems very skilled, so I asked her to cut my hair.

I don’t know, maybe it’s the way I dressed today or something, but things did not go well. She washed my hair, and scraped my neck with her nail—it was painful. Then she dried my hair but didn’t dry my ears. In fact she did not wrap tower around my neck so my collars got wet on the way back to her chair.

I asked to rinse my hair after the cut, but she rinsed it and then made many many adjustments. This left me picking very short hair out of my ear for minutes in the parking lot.

The cut itself was skillful but very underwhelming.

Also, I did not understand the other language she spoke to her coworkers. But to my ears the speech was kind of loud and harsh when she is cutting my hair right behind my ears.

For a experienced hair stylist, these seem unlikely to be mistakes.

So, hopefully you can meet the good side of Jenny like the positive reviewers experienced, but my hair cut here, as a new customer, was a very bad experience.< /text>

<Text>I've been visiting the midtown hair studio for the last 6 or 7 years, and keep coming back!

They almost always have walk in availability, and seem to schedule staff around peak hours so the wait isn't long. I can always expect to sit with a familiar hairdresser, which is great because they remember what I like. Whenever I walk in I'm greeted like an old friend. The entire staff, particularly the owner Zim, are always very friendly and charming, and never fail to make you feel welcome.

The haircuts are great, and the prices are reasonable. I always leave satisfied and will keep coming back. Great neighborhood hair cut!</Text>< username>

Went here recently.
My barber (I didn't get her name) cut me lightly on the back of the neck with the electric razor.  When I tried to inspect the wound in the end with the back mirror she tried to cover it up with my hair, mumbling something about how my hair looks better down in the back. Very Unprofessional!
The hair cut wasn't too great either.< /Text>

<Review>Finding talented, kind and accommodating hair-dressers can be quite a a challenge.  I am so thankful I found Midtown Hair Studio and plan to frequent this business for as long as the doors stay open!

Peter, one of the hair-dressers at Midtown Hair Studio, has cut my hair every two weeks for the past 6 months.  Peter, as well as the rest of the staff I've interacted with, are dedicated to providing high-quality haircuts, always extremely polite, and prioritize customer schedules by finding available hair-dressers in short time frames to accommodate schedule requirements.

If Google allowed 10-star reviews I would surely give Midtown Hair Studio all 10.  If you're searching for a new hair-dresser give Midtown Hair Studio a shot - I'm confident you'll be impressed.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808fba57d1753905:0xb3bdd0874fc3aa19< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went there for a simple haircut, no style change, nothing complicated. In general it was really hard to communicate with the stylist. She went super fast and refused to see the photo I wanted to show her when I was communicating the style my hair used to have. She ruined my bang by cutting it way too wide. In the end she blowed all the cut hair inside my shirt and ruined my day because now I have to go home and take a shower because of this terrible haircut.<//Review>

< Review>
This place was wonderful! I was three days away from my wedding and still had no stylist due to my lack of planning + time. My fiance (now husband) recommended this salon in the nick of time.

Made appointment for 10am. Later that day, got sick. Flu. (was already jet lagged to boot) Still wasn't better after two days. Called them around 9am on the same day I was supposed to be there and asked if I may change my appointment to 12:30pm. They obliged, and I was able to carryout my wedding ceremony without crashing. They were very understanding.

The lady who did my hair was super nice, very meticulous. She put her life and soul into my hair. She kept asking if I had any requests, any changes I'd like to make but nope. She did beautifully. And it only cost $65. (minus the tip)

Didn't catch her name, but she had a gorgeous asymmetrical short-cut, dyed blonde.< /Review>

<Text>When I walked in, I was brusquely told to sit down. Since I walked in near closing time, I tried to talk to someone to ask if I could still get a haircut that day, but was only more forcefully told to sit down again. I did ultimately get a haircut as soon as a stylist was available, which was solid and reasonably priced ($19), but I'm not sure I'll come back.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I tried to send this message to the owner only but could not find a way to do that from their website.  I thought I had found my new stylist when I had my consultation with Peter.  I was wrong.  I returned 2 days later and he did not remember me.  He did not listen to what I wanted and cut and styled my hair the way he wanted to.  I am now looking for someone to "fix" my hair.  Inexpensive but I will not be back.<//review>

I can't speak for women's haircuts, but this shop does a great job for men.  Neat, clean, efficient and great customer service.  They even clean your head, neck and face with a hot towel at the end.  Great prices, too.</Review>

<Text>The worst haircut I have ever had.  My hair was mid-back length and I asked to cut so it's 2-3 inches below the shoulder when DRY.  The stylist cut it to 1 inch below the shoulder when wet, which of course made my curly, fairly dry hair above the shoulder when dried.  The only good thing is that the haircut was fairly cheap and my hair grows fast, but for now, I will have to look like a mop for the next few months.  Will never go back there again!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808fba57d1753905:0xb3bdd0874fc3aa19</gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

< Review>
I give this place one star because there is no way of giving it a no star.

I went there due to a referral. The hair cut came out horrible, did everything I wanted the opposite of it, after I tried to explain to them how I wanted the cut to be, and why I wanted it that way.

It was a waste of time and money, and a struggle trying to justify what I was trying to tell them. Driving away I asked myself why I was getting myself into the situation in the first place.

The fee structure was also outrageous. Stay away!!< /Review>

Good place to get a reasonably priced haircut. They can be busy in the afternoons with kids and in the evenings with people coming after work. Parking lot in front has lots of space.<//Text>

<Date>1608577458112<//Date><Rate>4< /Rate><Review>I've been going to Giants games for as long as I can remember. I love my team  we have had season tickets for 15+ years and couldn't be happier. I love the park. It's my home away from home. Everybody is generally nice and respectful. Food is a little over priced but that's big businesses for you. I love the new score boards and clock. I wish the food vendors would come into our section or around our section more often so I wouldn't have to leave the game to go get hot chocolate. my family loves the Giants so much that even my kid wants to grow up to play for them. He's already started by playing for the Junior Giants and I'm coaching. I will continue to come to this park...or wherever the Giants go, until I die.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I won first prize in raffle. We're in San Fran - at Giants  game. Walked  from our hotel "Signature" How fun is that? Let me explain...FUN!!!
Food, sports gear everything else is OVER priced. But how else can they pay those MLB player wages?!?
We were thrilled with our excellent seats. We even had quick & easy walk in - did not have to wait in any line.</Text>< name>

We have been to 6 or 7 games this year and a handful last year. The park is beautiful! The kids love going, from touching the foul poles to sitting in the cable car to going down the slides, the kids have fun! Did I mention we love baseball too? The atmosphere is always good and the players really engage with the crowd in between innings which adds alot of value to going to their events! We always look forward to returning, hopefully the Gigantes can get their ship going the right way soon!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>I've been swimming on an adult club team at this pool for three years. The aquatics facility is beautiful, the coaching staff is great and I love swimming with others.  The pool is not open to the general public, so I'm glad I found a program that has a permit, the only one! The pool also has a hot tub where you can relax after a long set. The other swimmers are friendly, the locker rooms are clean; it is overall a great experience.< /review>< pics>

It is one of the best pools in the area. A pool for diving, and another one for swimming. The big pool has a depth range of 7 to 16 feet. Very good maintenance.< /review>

<Review>Muji Santa Anita opened on January 12th, 2017. Muji makes unbranded high-quality stationary, home goods and other accessories.

Muji is a Japanese minimalistic-design centric store. The price point is higher l, but the quality and design is outstanding.

The layout of the store is fairly straightforward. As you walk in, stationary (Notebook and pens) and their humidifiers are in the first section. On the left side, there are some clothing. From there on, there are home accessories Suh as clocks and plates. Further inside are the cookware and cleaning accessories used in home.

Muji Santa Anita has a unique stamp station in which consumers can use cute stamps to personalize the notebooks they buy. (See Picture)

If you love minimalism and quality, this store is definitely worth a visit.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2dbbd12668a99:0x4bfd25be8e8cf270</gmapID>< Pictures>

<GmapID>0x80c2dbbd12668a99:0x4bfd25be8e8cf270<//GmapID><review>A very unique store. Dedicated to all things Asian sourced, predominantly Japanese and Korean. All sorts of finds there. The only thing that keeps me from buying is the price is not on par with quality in my opinion. Most feel like temporary pleasures than items that will stand the test of time both in entertainment and quality.</review><user>107882338272962327477</user><resp>None</resp>< time>

<review>They have pretty much most of the cool stuff that you may find at a MUJI in Japan, though as per any store, the inventory is based on region and that regions market. This MUJI is big, and has a lot to look at and likely buy.</review><gmapID>0x80c2dbbd12668a99:0x4bfd25be8e8cf270</gmapID>< Response>

<name>Alan Burkes<//name><Rating>5</Rating><text>They sell home goods, stationary, and clothes that are too small to fit a lot of people.

Their gimick is that they don't brand anything. Everything is in plain packaging and the designs are all very minimalist. The upside is that everything looks very modern and they fit in well with whatever decor you have. Quality is pretty high, and while I would say most of their products are a bit overpriced, they are worth the price. Most of their notebooks are very good for writing with fountain pens, which is great because they also sell a fountain pen.<//text>< Pictures>

Great place!
Always go here
Never buy anything
This is one of those places I go into, look around for a bit, and then leave once the emptiness of my wallet forces me to get out.</Review>

Absurdly long wait time and rude service. The food is pretty ok, but you have to order everything you want the first time. Adding to you order, like a desert or a second serving of a food item or drink, could result in an additional 45~60 minute wait. There is no English ordering-list so you will have to match up the numbers pictured on the menu or, in some cases, just guess. You're not going to get much help from the servers.</Text>

(Translated by Google) 2019 February 28th 10:30 Arrive at the Hyatt Restaurant, today a group of four people bunch, ordered 12 dim sum and three lunch specials
In about twenty minutes, A sister offered three dishes and six snacks. I immediately asked the waiter to send the soup and rice. After 20 minutes, the soup and the rice were still not available. I had to ask the minister and inform him. Still waiting for the white meal, and my lunch time is faster...
I have been waiting until 11:30. I am still waiting for the three-disc snack, the soup and the rice.... The fire is burying.
I immediately requested to pay the bill and pack it..... The ultimate waiter should pack the soup and rice, but still owe a snack.
11:33 Buried to leave. ... Total $85.61 Zero Tips 😡
I myself helped to open the peninsula, I feel that the peninsula is very good at serving the system... Who doesn’t know
"Nothing is worse, worse." I am really disappointed with Hyatt!

2019 二月二十八日 10：30 到達凱悦大酒樓, 今天一行四人食 bunch, order 了十二款點心和三款午膳特價小菜
二十分鐘左右阿姐奉上三碟小菜和六款點心, 我隨即要求侍應送上例湯和白飯, 過了二十分鐘例湯和白飯仍然欠奉, 我只好向部長查詢並通知他我仍在等候白飯, 兼且我午膳時間快過...
一直苦等至 11：30 我仍在等候三碟點心, 例湯和白飯....... 火都滾埋😡😡😡😡
我即時要求埋單和打包..... 最終人侍應把例湯和飯打包, 不過仍然欠了一份點心😡😡😡😡

(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, the big feast is a drink, and the general meal is very suitable. Hospitality is kind and welcoming, although there are many guests, you can still enjoy a comfortable meal.

食物美味，大宴小酌，一般用餐都很適宜。待客殷勤親切，雖然客人很多，還是可以舒適的用餐。<//text>

<Text>Pro tip: Come early April and you may see cherry blossom without going all the way to Japan. We did

Pro tip2: To save a few bucks for the parking fee you could park across the street in the mall and walk in to the park.We didn't do that ;-)

We also got lucky and saw some Mexican/Indian celebration (Hope we got this right) so cool to see something that's authentic which they did it for themselves and not for tourism.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2Q2RB-rMTNeHNZME46MKiFaEXpW6HOMSCm52Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgVORkkt0Xq45nvR_-X1ppZalL6MiJRiHGdsjs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiVG8ktlWlJ-lNf_uyKM5RkEp6llbdGTtmHXOO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-esLUM_X7dqaXnXmodfYZdBO4uapz_PXMW07a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3GHjcw3wUl73hFdGVNyCjYMM2Xby0ZISLiBwO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkh2ANbGSyTvjXsFobnUiieCT41fJzhkfzQ7yY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2ADwR91_eR6zTapR-MoaJ3poKlKrjEVnFlFW-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoZzmnwYnN1WHchCIDnQYAoOtXs7XJrWXDJ7KR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0N659Xle4OC1Wl7I2Pep3h9B4sW_jxzjJkKw9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPBODelIo-K6galYyo-DxRuyNDPwX2gnNmptxZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhDzb1dVRYH6a1krb7kV7u2c24uhFCdzJisplg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmiltStUuffak6-DQezqFvZypiAlZVG4-G0CnE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPflvrTZ8VF7TJgS7CWeVOf36zrzQeLOUk9bSZy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<Review>Beautiful park for an amazing walk/run/hike. Stream runs the length of the picnic areas and playgrounds. Plenty of green grass areas with shady big trees. But this park main attraction are all the great hiking trails and views.  Beware of bobcats, coyotes and rattlesnakes.<//Review>< date>

<rate>4</rate><text>Cool place for jogging,  hiking or just to relax under a pepper tree.
The only downside is that it is so littered. People should start appreciating this place and what it represents, when they start appreciating it, they'll start respecting it as well. There's more than just sloppy humans on this planet.</text>< date>

I recently took my grandchildren and dog to play at this park. This was the park that their father used to visit when he was a little boy. Back then there were animals and a flowing river. I was so happy to see that it is still well maintained. They have 2 great playgrounds and several long winding trails. The park is wide, spacious and very inviting. My grandchildren want to visit again and at that we will have a nice picnic.</text>

Very nice park to go for a run/walk. Just the thing that bothered me were the rocks on the trail but if you like that then go right for it. I went with my dad for the first time and we really enjoyed it. Really nice views too.<//Text>

A great park to walk around! Came here last week with my dog to view the cherry blossom trees and we weren’t disappointed! The main walking path was lined with dozens of sakura trees, and most of them were in full bloom. This park was spacious + clean, and visiting on a beautiful spring day made the experience even more special. 🌸

Parking: they do charge for parking, so if you don’t want to pay I recommend parking in the small shopping center next to the park.

*Note: this park does require everyone to wear masks! I thought that most people would be maskless but I was pleasantly surprised to see that 99% of the people I passed were wearing one 😊<//Review>

<text>This really is a great park.  So many trails and beautiful hills.   Great place to go and disconnect.  The reason I removed a star is because I was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake.  Just be careful on the trails.  Walk in the center of the trail and look out.<//text>< pics>

<gmap_id>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d< /gmap_id><Text>Park with playgrounds, hiking trails for all levels, and horseback riding. You can park inside (paid) or try to find street parking along the neighboring areas. It’s located right across the Puente Hills Mall, so you can easily grab a meal or go shipping before/after being at the park. Public restrooms are available and still open during covid. Masks are required.

There are a lot of different trails you can take and there’s workout equipment like pull up bars available. Some of the hikes do get a bit steep, but there are family-friendly options. There’s also a cement path for those looking for a more flat surface. There’s not a lot of shade, so bring a hat and wear sunscreen. There are a lot of picnic tables and I noticed a lot of families/groups using them. There are snakes and mountain lions so be mindful. Overall, this park provides a great way to have access to nature even in the middle of the ‘burbs.</Text></record>

With the stay at home locked down ended yesterday, it’s the best time to go to parks to enjoy nature and soak up those much needed vitamin D to boost your immune system.

After the rain, the sky was extra blue and the air was so clear and fresh. Coming out to Schabarum regional park was the best decision. My wife and I heard that the stay at home locked down order had ended, we immediate decided to come to this park to catch the plum blossom before it’s too late.

This park is the only few of the parks in LA that have cheery and plum trees where they will blossom at the beginning of Spring. Without being able to go to Japan this year to view the Cherry blossom, this place is the closest thing.

It’s kind of interesting to know that in 1992, this park formed a sister relationship with Kairaku-En Park in Japan.

With the rain this week, the flowers are blossoming  with extra beauty. The colors of the flowers, white, red and pink blanketed the whole park. This scenery made you feel like you’re in Japan.

After gluttonous picture taking activities, we decided to hike up the hills to get some exercises. Once we get to the top, we were awed by the beautiful scenery of. The San Gabriel Valley. With the clear blue sky we can see all the way to the snowy top of Angeles Crest.

There are more to do in this park then just viewing cherry and plum blossoms. People come here to play soccer and tennis, picnic, hike, and horse back riding.

For the hikers, the trail here connects to the historic Juan Bautista De Anza National Historic Trail. There are plenty of parkings. Normally the fees for parking is $6. But during the pandemic, it seems that the parking is free. No body is at the gate to collect the fees.</review>

Very beautiful park. From cherry blossoms in the spring and hiking in the south end of the park, it’s well worth visiting. However, you have to pay for parking which can be rough, especially on weekends where it’s $5 and park may be overcrowded. But it’s very lovely driving inside the park once you get in.< /Review>

The Schabarum Skyline trail is truly one of a kind if you're looking for a variety of landscape for a jog, hike, or simply a walk. You can choose from a flat pavement to a more intense incline trail at a higher elevation. One thing I would note is this place have snakes and mountain lions which is typical in a vastness of grassland that considers to be a wilderness. It is advised to accompany with others if you decide to go on a wild hike. Also, there are horses that you can rent at the park if you want to have a wild experience.</review>

<Review>The best local park to see cherry blossoms 🌸 Some are mature trees and some are newly planted
All cherry blossoms trees are donations from dr. Gu at Azusa in remembrance of their son who died in a hiking trip. They chose to turn grief into passion, the love of nature in a form of cherry blossoms which are enjoyed by so many people! While we are mesmerizing with its beauty, we always remember the pain that they went through. The pain of loosing a son who just graduated from university. We should cherish life and be grateful with each family member in our daily life!<//Review>< pics>

Been going three straight weekends Sunday. Been doing the .2.0 m trails that overlooks the park. Great workout,  and also has some machines for stretching  and the front entrance. No so crowded has bbq grills but so far have not seen anyone use it. I've eaten at the tables but thats about it. Has some drinking fountains and bathroom. But just bring your water bottles</review>

<Review>This place is amazing it has plenty of space for picnics. It has plenty of space for family or friends get together. It has beautiful hiking trails and if you want to know one of them leads to horses. Some of the restrooms are open so you need to pay attention to the sign in the entrance to see which ones are. People take their bikes here so if you want bring yours. If you want a park that has tranquility this is definitely the one for you! My boyfriend and I make this our twice a month adventure.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvMM220VGpwnyWXQUIeSF69LAXySmDVQ3x59fz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvuTiAQGXbhuGXtJ3uOttxYpc3SZlpu51hSsjn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxGxaVz8fr-rgPC3yXvpq1aKALbopiv8rpaFv_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuOCFGtMFItK3L-9_hYl2JHDAJDHDEB0CWwHCX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORnx_zfkwV-5jLZpEDk1yZ7RpM5p89M3vdDL-V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd375FdWzvNqle2tjsipeifHMx4lMTqpIVMapj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEwL82wT31Kt6N5_IZJ4Rao4XVQ3_pScuEF9gp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_TS3bTqgYY5a8jPxLSPgAQrul0gpw_KsUWKRl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Nice big park with lots of room to spread out and remain socially distant. Most people wear masks, at least when they get near other people which is also comforting. There is a lot to explore in the park, I just wish people would take better care of the park and pick up their trash. There is a lot of small pieces of litter in the park.< /text></record>

Beautiful park, especially right now when all the cherry trees are blossoming. Trails are well maintained and clean. Restrooms are well maintained too. Plenty of tables and playgrounds.< /text>

A large regional park, good for all levels of hiking experience. Tons of parking inside. There are three kid playgrounds that attract young families. We love to come here for the Spring cherry blossom.< /Review>

I head down at least once a week for my hike. Its lovely seeing the changing seasons throughout the year. From the park, you're able to see the changing foliage and cherry blossoms, and out on the trails, wildflowers bloom and give way to brush and the like. It's always a treat catching sight of all the wildlife on your way up as well. The trails aren't too daunting, and the park is large and lovely. Would highly recommend visiting with the whole family.</text>

One of my favorite places in the San Gabriel Valley. Schabarum Park is the best way to "get out there" without really leaving suburban LA. There are miles of trails teeming with wildlife to be explored on foot, bike or horseback. Some trails are easy and popular with somebody always within eyesight. Others are more remote and it's easy to forget you're a few miles away from a mall. They do charge for parking on the weekends, so park across the street in the mall lot and walk over.</Text>

This park is very large with plenty of parking for $6. Lots of land throughout this park with plenty of shade.lots of picnic tables and BBQ's. hiking trails for hikers and mountain bike riders. Also great for horses to take on this park with lots of terrain and hills throughout this area.great to bring the kids for gatherings and special occasions such as B-days or jus for families or friends to enjoy a little outdoor activities.lots of wildlife out here also. Be watchful for the kid's due to lots of cars coming and going throughout the day at this park.< /Text>

Great huge little park. I did not know it had trails. This is a great place for us that do not have Griffith park around the corner.
Horseback riding as well and you can also bike here.< /review>

The park itself if beautiful, and also allows access to miles of wilderness trails into the hills.  The trails allow walking, running, biking, and horseback riding.  Trails are closed for two days after rains.  Passing signs that indicate the trails are closed can result in a citation with a fine.  The trails are beautiful all year long and provide many views of wildlife and the cities below.< /Review>

Went on a weekend and there were lots of homeless people and trash scattered around the park (canned food, plastic wrappers, etc). The entry costs $6 per car. If you're paying to come here, I'd recommend you look for other regional parks in the area as they're more likely to be cleaner and be bigger</Review>

<Text>WOW! THIS PARK IS AMAZING!!!!!  Just being in this natural beautiful place is just a little slice of paradise in the LA county area. Who would've guessed this gem of a place would be tucked away so sweetly. I saw so many squirrels, rabbits, butterflies and so much more!

I will be back to take another relaxing nature walk.

P.s PLEASE WEAR YOUR MASK! LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE AREA! ❤️</Text>< UserId.>

Great trails up the hills with interesting climbs, for easy walking, mountain cycling and outdoor family fun. You will get a good exercise on this trail with great views.

Then come down and enjoy the greenery of the park if you want to do easy scooting rides, pushing baby prams with wide spacing to ensure everyone gets the exercising without crowding. Family enjoyed our outing here.</Text>

Fun spot to hang. Go for a hike or bike ride. There is a $6.00 parking fee on weekends though.</Review>

Got hint that there was cherry blossoms blooming around the time I went.  I guess I just missed it or something was astray. I saw one tree bloom but it was too small to make dent int the experience. So,I said hey how about the hiking trail. The trail is great for beginners but I found forks that had no map direction. The experience probably would have been better granted I didn't get charge to visit a park. I never heard of that until I came here. To rub salt in the wound, 30 mins later there no one was charging to park. I guess we drew the luck of the draw. Maybe , next time will be a better experience.</text>

There aren't lots of trees but good enough to take some pretty pictures.  Weekdays are less people with no parking fee charged.  When you enter to the front entrance, you'll keep driving down until you see the horse ranch on the left.  That's where all the pretty cherry blossoms are.</Review>< name>

Any park with an exercise area AND a hiking trail is automatically dope. Not to mention that it's so pretty, and the view up top is fantastic. Hike, exercise, play tennis(!), or just chill and have a picnic, whatever you wanna do it's a great park for it.</Review>

I've been coming here since I was very little. Though some things have changed, it's still my favorite regional park of all time.</Text>

There are trails, abundance of picnic tables with grills, parking spots, public restrooms and grassy areas to choose from. Great for walking, jogging and biking. The signs say no drones and skateboards are allowed. This was a great spot to walk our dog, she sure loved it. Watch out for snakes and mountain lions in the hills/trails. Make sure to check out their dedicated butterfly and humming bird area sanctuary next to the amphitheater.< /Text>< Name>

< review>
Our second time visiting this park. I enjoyed it this time as much as the first. The park is huge and has different kid/pet friendly trails. Not sure if this Park is busy during Summer season will have to give that a try in a few months. Today's visit was awesome with our big family.  We were able to have the end side of the park all to ourselves. Highly recommend.</review>

<Text>I love bringing my dogs to this park. I get a long line and train my dog. It's pet friendly. Deeper into the park there is a trail I take my dogs to as well. It's free on the weekdays. On the weekends I park along a side street.<//Text>< Time>

Nice trails, a few playground areas, an exercise area, picnic areas, some informative signs about the animals, insects and plants along one of the paved paths and if you play pokemon go some stops and gyms with decent spawns along the paved paths</review>

Always busy but that's okay, this place is huge! Free parking during the week but pay for parking on the weekend...$7 if i remember correctly. To me, not worth the fee...stick to the weekdays.</Review>

<review>I only go during the week as entrance to the park is free. They charge to go in with your vehicle on weekends. This park has a few trails that are fun to walk, run, or hike. Also has a ton of picknick areas with charcoal grills. Great for groups, kids and well, everyone.</review>< pics>

This park is free to public during weekdays. The gate for vehicles to enter closes at about 5:30PM, so make sure to get there before that time. There are good amount of trails for people to wonder around, and some nice green lawns for people to play on. Overall a good park to visit.< /Review>

This has nothing to do with the park itself. It's lovely there and for the majority of the time it's clean. I have in the past reccomended all my family and friends to visit here. So, I'm extremely  bummed I'm posting this review: it's become clear, from my last couple of visits, they're not implementing masks wearing for vistors and within the staff out on site. Also, the park has slowly become more congested these last past weeks. Please correct this!< /Text>

The park is beautiful and has so much to offer.  It is perfect for hiking, picnics and gatherings.  The one thing we did notice is that there are various trees that are dying or dead.  We were curious if it was due to improper care,  irrigation or a tree disease?<//review>

Free parking on weekdays (except for holidays),  a 2-mile hiking trail around the park, an even longer trail for people more fit than me, horse stables with riding classes, multiple play areas for kids, an outdoor body-resistance gym area for adults, and numerous grassy & wooded areas to explore. This has become my personal place to just get away.< /Text><userid>108913406434098123774< /userid>< rate>

this place have been a lifesaver since all the gym have been closed this place allows you to walk miles and miles of trail up into the mountains and gives you a good break on your mind and the well-being of your body, the park is well-kept quiet and safe.<//review>

Nice trails, a few playground areas, an exercise area, picnic areas, some informative signs about the animals, insects and plants along one of the paved paths and if you play pokemon go some stops and gyms with decent spawns along the paved paths</review>

this place have been a lifesaver since all the gym have been closed this place allows you to walk miles and miles of trail up into the mountains and gives you a good break on your mind and the well-being of your body, the park is well-kept quiet and safe.</Review>

I only go during the week as entrance to the park is free. They charge to go in with your vehicle on weekends. This park has a few trails that are fun to walk, run, or hike. Also has a ton of picknick areas with charcoal grills. Great for groups, kids and well, everyone.< /review>

Beautiful park, and I've only seen 1% of it! It gets pretty busy so if you do come via car plan on being patient when parking as cars enter and exit. When I was there working on one of the several picnic tables I heard several car horns.

Four stars because the bathrooms were very gross and this was at 9 in the morning so you could tell they don't clean them overnight. Also picnic tables were very dirty and sticky. It wasn't from the trees, it was from beverages being spilled and other sorts that made it sticky.< /Text>

Nice retreat from the suburban sprawl. Great picnic areas to reserve for BBQ's & gatherings. This regional park offers hiking, running, horseback riding, trail biking, tennis courts, amphitheater, playgrounds for kids, free summer concerts, nature to explore and re-creation for all. Support the park - pay the minimal parking fee!</text>

Not really sure... rattlesnake warning signs around, but I used to live in Palm Springs...the rattlesnakes don't bother anything.  The self entitled, arrogant wanna-be movie star, no-knowing ATTITUDE in general is more venomous.  This park is beautiful... you can hike as far, or short as you prefer.  DO watch out for the critters... THEY we're there before we were!  Respect their rights!!!</text>

< Review>
A great local regional park with trails, play grounds, creek and picnic area with grills.  You can decide how far and how long of time you would like to walk on trails.  You may cross the top of hills and walk to the other side of Fullerton.  Also horse trails inside the end of the park, and you may arrange horse rides.</Review>

<review>Great spot for a mild hike. They charge for parking on the weekends and any major holiday, I think like 8 bucks. Saw a rattlesnake right on the trail slithering into the sides, so definitely don't have your kids running too far ahead. You could also bbq with plenty of shade.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

This park is pretty expansive. It's got good trails, nice playgrounds, good looking trees. It goes a mile or so back in with parking so there's plenty of space. They do charge entry on weekends and holidays, the rates all seemed to be under $10. I plan on coming here frequently, it seems to be a great place to get some easy steps in<//text>

< Review>
Nice trail for some weekend walk.  The view is nice and overall easy to finish as there are a few ways to cut the distance short as needed (easier side path or same way back).  The trail is about 4 people wide at most places, so no need to worry about limited walking space.< /Review>

<review>This is my favorite part because of the combination of natural, Wild open spaces where you can hike and encounter wildlife, and for the beautifully designed strip down the main thoroughfare which is perfectly balanced and spaced-out for you to the rental Pagoda, play tennis, have a party, let the children run loose on the playground, or meditate and there is also horseback riding at the very back of the park. This is a wonderful Park<//review>< date>

Regional Park that provides adequate recreational activities for all age alike. Hikers and trail seekers have abundant place to do their trek. Plants and wildlife abounds. The only thing is seeing some trash on the small creek that runs through the park, although not a lot it ruins the natural habitat of some animals, who might be living in that creek. The management should post more warning signs about trash responsibilities to all visitors.</text>

<text>While staying at the Courtyard Mariott hotel, I made the short walk to this park.  I walked on the trails that led into the hills at the back of the park.  There was plenty of room on the path.  From the upper levels of the path, the view of the valley was nice.  The area was well maintained.<//text>< rating>

<text>I come here for getting my exercise of the week in. Running up from the base near the exercise equipment, it's an uphill battle through relaxing and fulfilling scenery. Last time i went, some Sneaky McSneaks put a snake corpse at the end of a pedestrian bridge (think of how cats respond to cucumbers).

There are lots and lots of bbq grills, with plenty of restrooms and multiple children's play structures.<//text>< Pictures>

We grab our food to go from the noodle place across the street and come have a picnic here. Plenty of space and tables. Even when there are many people the park is large enough to find privacy and eat a meal in peace. Keep in mind that the restrooms close when the front booth does. This place is worth the admission price($6) if your going to spend a good part of your day here. Go up the hill high enough and you see a good view of the surrounding areas.<//text>< pics>

when my wife goes to the mall I come here.  the park goes along a wooded valley with a creek in the middle of it.  3 play grounds work out stations a paved path runs the length of this park which I long boarded a few times back in the day.  ton's of fat semi tamed squirrel living in the trees.  rustic natural trails go up into the hills.   you can visit 3 days in a row and hit different stuff each day.  There is a secret tunnel that runs under Albatross Rd</text>

<Date>1520316522812< /Date><Review>This is so much more than a park! Came here for a hike with a friend I hadn't seen in far too long, and we just explored and wandered around -- finding trails on hillsides that looked totally removed from the city, the horse stables, the tennis courts, and lots of lovely paved roads too. This park is the perfect spot for family fun days outside, picnics, engagement pictures, etc. It's right across the street from Puente Hills Mall, so if you don't want to pay for parking on the weekends or can't find a spot, head to the mall and walk across the street.

There's a few playgrounds and tons of clean bathrooms. Many groups use the park for weekend salsa, yoga, soccer lessons, etc. Wonderful community space and a great outdoors area for the inland empire.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><user>111158142056966751770< /user>< rate>

<Text>Hey this: It's across the street from a mall and a Soup Plantation, a mall, a costco, a movie theater, a bowling alley and so much more yet you can hike, ride a horse, play several sports, enjoy scenic views and wildlife and awesome and clean amenities for kids. Not to mention the awesome staff. Did I mention the urgent care and daiso right next door.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

when my wife goes to the mall I come here.  the park goes along a wooded valley with a creek in the middle of it.  3 play grounds work out stations a paved path runs the length of this park which I long boarded a few times back in the day.  ton's of fat semi tamed squirrel living in the trees.  rustic natural trails go up into the hills.   you can visit 3 days in a row and hit different stuff each day.  There is a secret tunnel that runs under Albatross Rd< /Text>

Running up from the base near the exercise equipment, it's an uphill battle through relaxing and fulfilling scenery.

There are lots and lots of bbq grills, with plenty of restrooms and multiple children's play structures.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I've been going to this park for a long time! It is a lot of fun and quite expansive. I like to stroll through the winding paths, then take a nice hike in the chaparral covered hills that have a great view. The park is also full of beautiful trees and healthy grass which make it a great picnic spot< /Review>

<userid>111158142056966751770</userid><Text>This is so much more than a park! Came here for a hike with a friend I hadn't seen in far too long, and we just explored and wandered around -- finding trails on hillsides that looked totally removed from the city, the horse stables, the tennis courts, and lots of lovely paved roads too. This park is the perfect spot for family fun days outside, picnics, engagement pictures, etc. It's right across the street from Puente Hills Mall, so if you don't want to pay for parking on the weekends or can't find a spot, head to the mall and walk across the street.

There's a few playgrounds and tons of clean bathrooms. Many groups use the park for weekend salsa, yoga, soccer lessons, etc. Wonderful community space and a great outdoors area for the inland empire.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1520316522812</date>< user_name>

<Review>Schabarum Regional Park is one of those hidden gems in the larger LA area.  Despite being right next to one of the busiest freeways in the city, this is one of the cleanest and quietest parks I have ever been to.  It has great hiking trails and plenty of picnic areas.

I happen to go on a Sunday for a light picnic.  The weather was great for a picnic as the trees would alleviate from the heat, yet there were no picnic-ers.  Perhaps it had something to do with the $6 parking fee.  I thought this to be a small fee to pay for having a quiet picnic.  Sometimes you do want a large space just to yourself.< /Review>< Pics>

Clean, well maintained big Park. Lots of trails to explore. Most benches and bbq sections are amongst the shade of pine or eucalyptus trees. 3 playgrounds for the kids, at the far end of the park there are horse stables. Not entirely sure if you can rent them to ride though.</review>

Have been coming here quite a bit to hike, and I love this park! Free parking during the week, but you must pay on the weekends. Hikes are nice, and trail is kept up. Typical busy trail hours are anytime after 6pm during the week, and anytime after 7am during the weekend.</Review>

<review>there are a lot of winding trails in this park and different routes to walk around through. the trail is well maintained and pretty busy the later in the afternoon it gets. i suggest get here early and leave early as well. overall, it's an easy to get to location and it's close to home. there is somewhat of a difficulty when it comes to finding and parking there though.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Huge park. A lot of trails. The people are kind of mean when it comes to petting their horses. They don't like it so unless you come across a nice owner your e not allowed to pet the horses.

<Text>Great place for a morning or night walk, dog friendly, next to the 60 fwy, and yet so refreshing! They offer free concerts on Tuesdays throughout the summer. If you are driving there be ready to pay for parking. There are several nice and big areas for picnic, you may need to call to reserve though.<//Text>< pictures>

They need to have someone patrol the area at all times, especially being a popular park, I've been coming here for years and I don't want to see it go to ruin. I took my daughter and there were drug addicts by the bathroom doing what they do best in front of kids!! A lady yelling and walking back and forth talking to herself and scaring the children.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Lots of parking throughout the park. Bathrooms ok the few times I've gone in. Great trails and beautiful views. Some family tried to close off the bridge leading to the jungle gym area one Satyrday because they reserved the tables for a party. A park worker found out or was informed of this and quickly came over to tell them they can't block access, and that they only have reservations to the tables and not the whole area, which is used by other families and children and pokemon players.
The grounds are nice, I have yet to step on any dog poop which is a huge plus. Dog walkers are considerate and restrain their pets and clean up after them. Just overall a really nice place for a hike, dog walking, picnics, and public events like the pet adoptions, music shows, and pokemon community days</Review>< Pics>

Never have a bad experience here. There are picnic tables throughout, restrooms located every so often, and playgrounds for children to enjoy. Bring your dog too and enjoy the hiking available (just be sure to have them leashed as it is a leashed park only for pets). Beautiful scenery and lots of open space to picnic.</Review>

<Review>I took 1 hour hike on the trails, so wonderful!  The view at the top is a reward.     I loved seeing the horses and smelling the eucalyptus trees.  A lovely way to get exercise.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Cherry blossoms, horses, lizards, electric towers...

It was not a hike I expected because it was like a walk into the park at first (at least the trail we took) with cherry blossoms surrounding you which were pretty and then it got steeper barren hills. The view over the hill was awesome though, especially since I got to be close to the electric towers and saw a beautiful view of the city.

Bad part was $6 for parking which was a surprised when we entered this place, but at least I had a good time and went to 85 degrees after which was directly across from this place. Cool place to check out and then there are many places to eat and walk around it.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Large park with excellent amenities and hiking trails. Be prepared to pay a fee for entering with a vehicle based on vehicle size. Walking into the park is free.< /Text>

<text>Great paved walking paths and some hiking trails. The park is well maintained. Decent amount of pokestops but as you move further into the park, reception can be spotty. Has two tennis courts where there is normally a wait to play. There is also a park admission fee for vehicles depending on day and time. Park closes at sunset.</text>< pics>

Today we went for a hike. Tried to play a bit of tennis but a baby rattlesnake disagreed with our plan. We ended up kicking the soccer ball around. But I really have wanted to do was join the older folks and do some tai chi in the mornings.</Text>

This a great park to visit for some fresh air. Lots of open space to walk around and plenty of green grass to enjoy. There are even some workout benches alongside some of the trails, and there was a camping area at one end of the park. As a side note, it is now frequented by Pokemon GO players.<//review>

Tough hike!!! I love it!!! Takes me about 2 1/2 hours to finish the entire thing, to the very top and back. Lots of steep inclines, I suggest packing snacks and DEFINITELY some water if you plan on completing it too 👌🏼< /Review>

A place where people of all ages and ethnic groups can be found using the wide public spaces available in this park. Numerous hiking trails of varying difficulty, as well as play areas for kids as well. You can call the city to reserve picnic tables, as well as other spaces for private events. Overall, a great public recreation area that meets the needs of the local community. Check it out for yourself. Park on side streets for free parking too</review>

Trail length: 8/10      Trail difficulty: 4 - 6/10

Big park; restrooms near the parking area. Expect to pay a parking fee on the weekend, which helps maintain the park.  Plenty of shade near the parking and restrooms.

The trails can range from moderate to fairly difficult depending on which ones you take. Their are horse trails you can follow and some get really steep. Others are longer and meander along at a much gentler slope. Some of the trails have some shade but be prepared with a hat.

This places get fairly busy in all areas, from the park grass to any of the back trails, so expect to see people.<//Review>

Nice and quiet place, even though it's near all the traffic by Azusa and Colima.< /text>

I'm not an outdoor person. I only came here to catch pokemon, so I'm mainly rating it for that.

By the entrance is great, 3 stops and usually have several people to talk to.

As you go further in though, signal drops a lot. Also, when I was there, the sprinklers were on and spraying one of the main roads up at around 4 PM - 6 PM, which kind of sucks for people walking.<//text>

I love this park so much! Full of green grasses and tall trees. There are also playgrounds and trails to enjoy. Unfortunately, you will pay an entrance fee on certain days.< /Review>

<text>This is really good park for exercises and other activities.  Monday to Friday is free parking.  The weekend (Sat and Sun) is charged for $8 I think.  I like to come here for trail walk.  Sometimes, I will bring my dogs to walk with me.  You can drive your car all the way up and park there.  There is a loop trail about 3.2 miles.  Usually it takes me about 70 mins to walk.</text>< date>

Peaceful, beautifully designed parks, faint wafting of eucalyptus and the sound of middle aged Asian women doing aerobics and zumba.</review>

<Review>I came here for Bulbasaur during the Pokemon GO craze. It is definitely a park for those with Asian heritage. It can be daunting for people like my fiance who don't share that heritage. Also, it's huge. If you don't want to pay for parking, get there EARLY and park along the street. Get ready for a long but casual hike, if you plan to go all the up the mountain.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Great for hikes, bikes, dogs, walks. Great for grandparents and pokecatchers. And grandparent pokecatchers. You can catch a horse ride, explore multiple trails that can go for hours, or make the circle 3-mile small hike around the park. Play tennis, picnic, playground with the kids (but only if they're your own kids). The rain has brought back some of the childhood brooks!! FINALLY. We used to catch tadpoles here.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Date>1485503787436</Date><username>J T<//username><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

Very serene, I used to like sitting underneath the trees or hiking & hear the wind blow through the trees. There's also wild animals; rabbits squirrels & owls I once even saw a bobcat!! The trails are great, but watch your step!! Theres horse poo & ruts after it rains and gets muddy.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great place to ride a bike.  Some of the trails (the Skyline) can be quite steep so if you are a beginner, stay away for now.  There is a parking fee on weekends so we tend to park on the street beside the park.  No, you cannot park at the Marshalls near by :)<//Text>

Morning or night, great trails and good air.  Be careful, 6-9AM is busiest due to older people trying to get in their daily walk.< /review>

This is a really nice parkjust across from the Puente hills mall. This shopping center was in the film back to the future. There are horse corrals in the back of the park and plenty of private areas so you can have a party or family get together< /Review>

Huge park. Amazing for Pokémon Go players with multiple stops, gyms and tons of Pokémon. Biggest problem is people constantly walk in the road way in front of cars instead of the walking paths. Park is free on weekdays, pay on weekends.</text>

This park is huge. Theres a lot to see in this park and is a perfect  place to get a nice work out just walking around enjoying the scenary. It has a very nice trail you can go up to. Many people take their beautiful dogs and you can even see people on horses come by. It's always filled with happy people and kids. If you play pokemon GO then this is  a perfect place to come as well because of all the pokestops. I have been coming for a year and have yet to see all of it.</Text>

I always come here with my cat and dog. Watch out for crows if you bring your cat because the crows like to scope the area surrounding cat. But they never attack.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) When I came to LA, it was the first time I came here. It felt very hot, as hot as Phoenix, but at least there are big trees to enjoy the cool and a little green turf.
This park has a big playground area for walking and children (but it’s still too hot at two or three o’clock). However, there are too many police officers. I see a patrol car every ten minutes. I don’t know. what happen? There is a helicopter when I have to go...it’s really hot when walking here with a child on my back

(Original)
來LA，第一次來這，感覺很熱，跟Phoenix 一樣熱，不過至少這還有大樹可以乘涼、少許的草皮綠衣點最。
這公園有很大可以走路運動、小孩的遊樂區可以讓小孩玩（不過兩三點來這還是太熱）、不過，這警察也太多了，每十分鐘就看到一次巡邏車，不知道發生什麼事？要走時還有直升飛機...背著小孩在這走路，真的很熱...<//text>

(Translated by Google) It may be a common natural park in the United States, but it's the first California park I've ever met. Phytoncide, the bush? So good. It is good without separation. It is just nature. As soon as we left, we could climb to the right, and the view of the city was very good. Anyway, it was good. Berry berry. I want to live in California. I grow up every day.

미국에선 흔해 빠진 자연 공원일지 모르지만 내가 처음 겪은 캘리포니아의 공원이라 그런가 피톤치드, 숲향? 너무 좋다. 별거 없이 좋다. 그저 자연이 좋다. 출발하자 마자 오른쪽으로 올라가서 보이는 전경은 도시가 다보여 너무 좋았다. 아무튼 좋았다. 베리베리. 캘리포니아에서 살고 싶은 생각이 든다. 매일매일 무럭무럭 자라난다.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This is Regional Park in the middle of Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights. Many people are here for hiking, kung fu (tai chi), dancing, horse riding, and tennis cricket. Convenient; there are large areas of cherry blossoms, and the cherry blossoms are quite beautiful.

(Original)
這是Regional Park在Hacienda Heights及Rowland Heights中間，許多人在此健行、練功夫（太極）、舞蹈、騎馬、还有網球埸，地点適中，停車位多，去Hollywood Biwl都有公車站，非常的方便；有大片的樱花，樱花盛开時相当的美。<//text>
