<date>1566326369774</date><rate>5</rate><text>Every time I come to SF I rent from Charlie at Golden Gate Park Segways. So many people think that one needs a guided tour. I have a much better time on my own on the Segway! I’ve taken guided tours in other areas of town, but in Golden Gate Park you really do not need a guide. If you can use your iPhone just a bit and follow a simple path, you will have a great day! I might even go a second time before I leave beautiful San Francisco. Definitely worth calling and renting your Segway for a great day in Golden Gate Park with this company! Be warned, from the companies that require a guide, you often don’t know until the day of the tour if the group will “make“ or not. If there are not enough people in the group, the company will cancel and refund your money, but then you lost your shot at riding a Segway in San Francisco. When you rent from Charlie, since there is no need for a guide, it’s very easy and very unlikely that you will miss the opportunity to ride a Segway through beautiful Golden Gate Park! I cannot even skate, and I feel like a pro in the Segway. I hope this review helps travelers to have a nice time as I have had.<//text>< pictures>

The wife and I took a couple of Segway’s out for a few hours. Had a blast and would recommend this place to anyone. Went at our own pace, and saw lots of sights. Wish we would have rented these day 1 as we would have come back again throughout our trip to SF. They showed us how to use them and we headed out. Super easy and tons of fun.</Text>

<Text>What a blast! I had never ridden a segway before, but it is easy and so much fun. This company provided a wonderful experience and ruined me forever for formal guided segway tours. Golden Gate Park Segways took the time to show my group how to ride inside on their padded floor then took us outside to try out the hills near their shop and then set us loose! We got to choose what to see and where to stop. In 3 hours we toured Golden Gate Park, went up to Lands End to see the Golden Gate Bridge, took in some unique San Francisco neighborhoods, and even stopped for a quick bite to eat overlooking the ocean. What a fantastic afternoon!<//Text><GmapID>0x808587cc01586c35:0x41cecfc05f848508</GmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

Ok, I know some of you may think Segways are dorky but it was a blast. Rented them for almost 3 hours and took our time touring through Golden Gate Park. Owner, Charlie, was super nice. He made sure we had knew what we were doing (and it didn't come off our rental time) and let us go. Great way to see everything.< /text>

This is without a doubt the best way to visit San Francisco and the Golden Gate park. Not only are the fees reasonably low but you'll have a quick lesson before you leave and will enjoy your experience by yourself, without a guide, at your own peace, stopping to see what you really like. I will do it again the next time I'm in SF. Of course I already visited the park, but the Segway experience by itself is always memorable. And between you and me, with all the hills in the area, you'll be able to visit more things before you get tired. Thanks also to their amazing staff! Loved my experience!</Text>

The absolute best Segway experience! We did a tour a few years ago with a different company in SF. It was great but this was better! Our past experience was a guided tour. We would stop every few minutes during the 1.5 hour tour to wait for the whole group to catch up, then listen to the guide. Fun but not tons of actual riding. Segway SF Bay was a different experience. They made sure our kids (who hadn't ridden before) knew what to do and could handle themselves on the Segway, then they showed us some suggestions for where to ride and let us go. We were able to go at our own pace for the amount of time we chose. We toured through Golden Gate Park, went for ice cream at Polly Ann Ice Cream, then went to Lands End and saw the Golden Gate Bridge. We still had time left on our three hour tour so we were also able to go through the neighborhoods off of Sea Cliff. Such a fantastic time being able to create our own tour and there is nothing like riding Segways! Our girls (14 & 19) said it was the best thing they have ever done on a vacation!</review>

<Review>Great Service! I’ve been trying to persuade my fiancé for years to go on a Segway ride with me and she finally agreed while we were here! She was very nervous and tense but the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere put her at ease soon enough! We had an awesome time and would highly recommend it to anyone! Plus it’s the cheapest Segway rental in SF that we found! Thanks!< /Review>< Time>

After filling out some quick paperwork, a brief yet detailed and informative tutorial/coaching on how to ride the Segway is given.

Once you pass a quick lesson, you are informed of trails to take through GG Park, along the 1 freeway, and on the streets of San Francisco.

The equipment was safe, reliable, and easy to use. This is great fun for the family and couples.</Review>< Rate>

Great service and the best value for a Segway in SF.  Owner and rep both very friendly and helpful with routes, etc..  Liked the unguided rental and the location close to the park, beach, and view of the bridge.  Would quickly recommend to anyone visiting!<//text>

This place is awesome! Their prices are reasonable, the staff is fantastic, and the experience is amazing. The best part is that this is not a tour! You get to go out with your Segway and do whatever you want. My best friend and I cruised through Golden Gate Park and had a blast. If you're iffy about trying out a Segway, I would highly recommend it as I was iffy about it as well. I can't wait to go back.

One thing to note is that after your rental, walking might seem a bit strange and terribly inefficient :)<//review>

<review>Having never been on a segway, wasn't sure what to expect, but Charlie got our group of 8 setup and riding around in no time. He had maps, suggestions for routes, locks for the segways so we could stop somewhere and park them (we ended up having a bite @ the Cliff House), and he made sure all the segways were fully charged.

Great experience, well-priced. Good SF business.<//review>< Pictures>

Rented 3 Segways for 2 hours today for wife,  16yr  old daughter and myself. had an absolute blast touring GG park and lands end. First time for all 3 of us on segways and we all picked it up in a few minutes. I would highly recommend renting from here over taking a tour. You'll see so much more, go where you want  and be able to go at your own pace.</review>

David was awesome! I was in a little bit of a time crunch and needed to get 4 lines moved from a different carrier rather quickly. He was attentive and provided great customer service.  He helped me pick up 4 phones and worked quickly to get the numbers ported over. I ended up having to leave before all 4 phones had completed the porting; but when I returned he had all the phones ready to go. The whole process was painless thanks David.  Olga was great as well. She was my first point of contact on the phone, she was polite and very informative. I highly recommend this store. Their customer service was amazing.<//text>

If you're thinking about switching to Boost be warned, you are bound for one year. They advertise as a month-to-month service, but your phone is locked for a year. That means, if you decide to switch carriers, you will be unable to do so. I switched to Boost about 5 months ago. I bought a brand new sprint phone, cash, to activate on Boost. Activation went smooth and things were rolling. After some time we were unable to make calls, receive calls, or text from our home. Turns out the network is poor in Mission Viejo and surrounding areas. Eventually the network  stopped responding altogether with one of the phones on the plan. We were forced to go to another provider. We switched to T-Mobile after finding out our phones were compatible. T-mobile sent us the chip to insert into our phones that would activate it on the T-Mobile network. However, because Boost locked our phones we are unable to switch providers. Mind you, I have already paid for T-Mobile service. Now we have no phones to use and told me I have to wait a year to get unlocked. This is a terrible company with even worse coverage. You've been warned.<//Review>

<text>Probably the worst service I have experienced in the past two years since visiting the US. The two assistants were completely dis-interested in helping, and Had very knowledge about what they needed to do. I find it very odd that Boost SIM cards purchased at Target can't be activated at a Boost Store !!  Then they suggested i pay double the price paid for the Boost SIM from Target.  Don't visit the shop - a complete waste of time< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Nice, clean store with a large selection of items to choose from. I love ACE, but I usually go to another store that’s closer to home and is a bit larger in size. I will go out of my way to come back here simply because of the polite and courteous employees throughout the store. I will say there are a lot of children out front when school lets out, but it’s not too bad just a lot of walking traffic.</review>< pictures>

I really like like this ACE.

Great selection and super friendly staff! I usually find all I need here, especially the little odds n ends. Since there's not many selections in the area anymore this location getsca top spot. Dog friendly too!<//text>

Great place with friendly employees. However they do have a sarcastic side and will just stare at you while you struggle to get into the store. They will continue to stare until you realize it says PUSH not PULL 🤦‍♀️ Thank you lovely people for the ego check 😂🤣😂 definitely coming back!< /Review>

Friendly staff. Always attentive and helpful. Clearly, they deal with a lot of theft and that explains their attentiveness.  Their friendliness and kind demeanor when they assess me as not a risk is worth it.<//Review>

<text>Used to be very happy with this ACE but the costumer service has really fallen.  Not enough people working this store to justify ACE hardware prices.  They really dropped the ball yesterday on me and today they can't even manage to pick up the phone.  If I'm going to waste time I might as well shop on the internet and save half of my money.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>The associate Johnathon in the service section towards the back helped me figure out the problem with my tool and how to avoid that problem with understanding and courtesy. I would highly recommend them and this store. I have yet to go in and be disappointed by the help and selection of products.</review><user_id>107688054502723788679<//user_id><Date>1614122437061<//Date><Name>Ray J< /Name></record>

<review>I've always been able to find everything with the help of the employees. Plus I like the smaller store setting. Home Depot and Lowe's feel overwhelming to me. I like Ace and have no need to shop elsewhere for my hardware needs.<//review><date>1604878885689< /date>< gmapID>

< Review>
I thought I would need another case of 6 cans of a particular hard to find color of spray paint for our patio furniture, but after painting some more I didn't need the case I had ordered through a nice young man at the Eureka Way, Redding, CA store. Even though he wasn't able to take payment over the phone, I called the next morning to cancel my order. Nellie was amazingly kind in handling my call. I would highly recommend this store!< /Review>

<Review>Very nice selections,wide variety.i little pricey but that's the cost for convenient  right downtown.5  stars should be reserved for exceptional,personalized service as well as what's already mentioned, that said,I've been coming to this ace since it opened,I'm on one of your contractor accounts.and I never used to get id.ed but as the faces (employees ) have recently changed again .I feel like I should be on a first name basis.but even after showing my I'd and them checking the account several times a week.for them to not know my name is why I didnt give 5 stars.though I have nothing but good feedback for this ace.i feel there may be room for improvement.if only to please my own stubborn feelings.
Also nobody gives you guys enough credit for an outstanding specialty nut and bolt selection.for any need.
Thank you for not selling out to a bigger Corp like the others did locally

Store was busy today, but I was helped by a guy who was already busy working in the back, he dripped what he was doing and came to help the line get done at the rental counter. Item I rented worked perfectly. Great store and friendly employees!<//text>

They rent a good range of tools, and party supplies. The cashiers are super nice. Their membership rewards are nice too. Lastly, they have the cheapest propane on the west side.</Review>< pics>

<user>112845680299794667665<//user><text>Helpful ACE is a fantastic  place to shop for all sorts of our business need today.  Their customer service is the best.  I bought something too much so went back for a return one of them.  Their friendly assistance over my little purchase made me feel so valuable and cared.  I need to update my review with the lady's name who made the transaction smooth at the cash register later but she and Joe have been just amazing!  Perhaps all the staff has been extremely helpful during the shopping.

Thank you Helpful ACE!< /text>< Rate>

Very friendly employees for the area they have to work in.  God knows how many thieves and other dirtbags they get in here.   They also have a nice selection of rentals.  The only hardware store I'll go to on this side of town.< /text>

Prices are about what you would expect from a hardware store. They always seem to have everything I'm looking for and more. It's not a huge warehouse store like Lowe's or Depot. You get prompt customer service as soon as you walk in... Everyone is always asking if they can help you! Great customer service and selections on building and repair products!</Text>

<review>ACE the Helpful place?  Not really.

Needed propane for our RV.  They close at 7 pm but refused to service propane so they could be sure to be out by 7 pm - guess their hot date is more critical than customer service.

Seems if you are there before closing that reasonable services should be offered !< /review>< pictures>

The folks at ACE Hardware on Eureka Way in Redding are always welcoming, and knowledgeable. They treat one with respect, and will always ask if you need assistance.
A big plus, you do not have to search through the store in order to find help.<//review>

< review>
There's several Ace Hardware's in Redding Anna in the Redding area .
so make sure to use Google and find the one closest to you.
If you're buying a lot for major major projects
We have Lowe's and Home Depot 4 Xtreme projects but for bolts and  sandpaper and what not....little things
don't forget Ace Hardware
they're kind of like 7-Elevens on the corners all over the place.
They don't staff them with a lot of people
but they have a lot of stuff.
so you can generally find what you need,
and if you look hard enough you can always find someone.
the good thing about Ace versus Lowe's or any of the other big box stores is the people generally no a lot of what they're selling they're knowledgeable.< /review>

Don't go in there asking for physical assistance.  I needed help with carrying moving boxes up front (mind you i have a small child and a certified service dog with me) and NO ONE would help actually looked at me like I was dumb.  Again asked for assistance at the check out counter where 5 employees were standing around could clearly see I was struggling was refused help.  After check out for the 3rd time ZERO assistance was offered to me.  I COUNTED 5 CASHIERS and there was no line and while struggling to get to the counter 3 male employees that just kept walking by.  I just moved here from the city 6 weeks ago and im shocked I got more help when asked in the city than in this small country town!!!!!<//review>

July 28, 2018 they tried selling us a single face mask for $10!!!! #carrfire #pricegauging !!!!!
Then a year ago, I walked into the store  15 minutes before closing and the cashiers loudly expressed their disappointment of having customers walk in while they’re trying to close. They are very unprofessional and way over priced. I’d rather drive across town and walk a mile inside a big box hardware store then do business here.< /Text>

<review>Nothing bad to say about staff or customer service. The only issue is that they should stay open till 6pm. I'm one who commutes and does not make it home till 5pm. Would be nice if they extend their hours during the week or on certain days for the ones who can't make it before 5pm mon thru friday.<//review>< pics>

Xfinity likes to say that they are helping everyone by getting them connected, but I have noticed that the internet has been very slow lately and they are charging up the Ying Yang for going over our monthly usage. Hello Xfinity, kids are using the Internet daily and I have 3 kids all at once using it and I have a 2yr old also watching his videos. So if you really want to help people out then stop charging is so much for overages and give us more GB and better service so that it stops glitching and kicking the kids off the Zoom during class!!!!!< /Text>

< Review>
Been here a few times to swap boxes and really never had issues with the female staff. As they were always friendly and eager to assist and specifically answered any questions I had in regards to my sloooowww internet! My problem is more with the guy here. He is rude and honestly a jerk! One time I had to switch my modem and of course I explained the issue with it to him and he blows it off saying I don’t know what to tell you. Well if you don’t know what to tell a customer than maybe you shouldn’t be a CS rep 🙄🙄Xfinity in general is a big joke! Poor customer service and expensive pricing horrible WiFi even tho I’m on the supposedly TOP TIER. Unfortunately I’m stuck with them another year due to contract.<//Review>

Never again!!!!  If I had only looked at the reviews before I committed to this company!!! The reason they are still in business is because they are such a big company and can give the service they want.  They are a monopoly in the area that I am located .  They are the only one that has internet. Their customer service reps in a whole are nice.  But they are not trained for all problems.  I could go on and on!!  What is the use.  All in all I wouldn't care if someone set fire to them!!!<//review>

Yesenia has been a blessing to our family. She has been able to relate to both sides & help us come together. She loves kids, is a mom & wife, and doesn’t beat around the bush. She has extensive experience with kids - her own, teaching in a classroom, and in therapy. Her communication is with love and kindness, and in a way that allows each individual involved (child & adult) to hear the truth, evaluate themselves, and be motivated to choose better.<//text>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, not worth considering it your last option either. It really is very painful to part ways with my therapist who was very capable and caring because of the people from the office. I had been experiencing issues with my insurance lately that were caused by external factors related to bureaucracy. After receiving therapy through their practice for the past 10 months without an issue, they called me from the office the night before my following appointment was due to tell me my insurance rejected their claim for my most recent previous appointment. After a back and forth of phone calls they told me all they could do was cancel my very necessary appointment for the next day and offered to "save me a spot" with my therapist later the next day so I could sort out the issue with my insurance that morning. I understand everyone is struggling during the pandemic, but they really treated me like I was a a foreigner or a criminal of some sort for not being able to pay. They didn't bother offer a financial settlement to avoid interrupting treatment. Keep in mind this was ONE rejected claim out of more than a dozen that had already been processed. They didn't even bother to ask me if I was willing to pay out of pocket for this very necessary care. Upon this interaction, they showed me they weren't interested in my mental health at all, they were only interested in my ability to make my insurance pay them. I know the healthcare system in this country is broken, but regardless of this I have had multiple providers offer me client focused solutions to the problems that I've had with my insurance in the past. This is how I know that other providers are ethical in their practice and are guided by doing as much as they can for their patients' well being. Covenant Behavioral Health's interest in their patients is guided more by how much money they can make out of them. Very unprofessional and unethical business practice to say the least.< /text>

<Review>I've been under the care of a counselor for about 4 months who is truly compassionate. If there was a way of scoring less than 0 stars I would have rated this business a negative 10. For the benefit of my counselor I'll settle for the 1 star. I have had nothing but distress and anxiety added to my already mental condition because of the billing practices of this business. They submit claims with their wrong address and once the patient amount is paid by me, they declare they haven't received their payments which were made according to the processed claim within days of the submitted claim and paid to the address on the submitted claim. Then they cancel all of my much needed appointments demanding I fix the problem. The problem is internal to their business practices and impossible for me to fix. Then they want me to provide them with a credit card number so that they have cart blanch and can charge my credit card for services I have already paid for. They just can't find my payment because it was electronically paid to the address on the submitted claim and they are looking for it at their new address which has not been updated by them and changed on the submitted claim with my insurance company. I am at a level of anxiety, stress and depression much higher than it was when I started my therapy with this business. I recommend that anyone considering using Covenant Counseling Helendale, CA to find someone else. Don't trust them... don't use them. They'll only cause you to sink deeper into your mental health condition.</Review></record>

<review>This place is a joke!!! They treat you like a joke!!! They say they care about veterans, guess what. They do not! Please if you are a Veteran stay away! They do not take your care seriously! I even talked to  DR Wilson who runs this circus and he clearly made it worse, saying they take their patients  seriously,this place is just a joke!!! After careful consideration and the lack of respect this place has for its patients I will be filling a congressional  complaint against this Dr and his clinic!<//review>< pictures>

He made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire process of the treatments. He also takes the time to explain things very well. The treatments have helped with my body aches and numb feeling in my body (I had a stroke 2 years ago). It has honestly been a big difference compared to the last Doctor I was seeing for this type of treatment. Thank you again Dr. Lee and your awesome staff!!</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

<Review>Dr. Lee and staff are friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. I've had lower back pain from sitting at my desk for long hours, but with Dr. Lee's help I've been able to reduce my pain, stimulate my sore muscles, and also Dr. Lee has motivated me to have a healthier lifestyle. Visit Dr. Lee for any physical or emotional blockages. Acupuncture has been around for centuries and more Westerners need to experience it. It's an amazing tool to add to your tool box for longevity. =]<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>5</Rating><GmapID>0x80c2ccd55d3b6835:0x7bee4daa2202141f</GmapID>< username>

I went to Dr Lee when I was 41 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I was trying to avoid having an induction. I saw Dr. Lee in the evening and went into labor that night. My contractions actually started during the treatment. I’m so grateful and highly recommend Dr. Lee! He knows what he’s doing<//Text>

Professional Staff and top notch service. Went in for problems with neuropathy in hands and feet along with back pain. After first session back pain was gone and I slept great. Went again and feel great. neuropathy is getting better and I was able to walk better the next day with reduce pain.

The thought of needles in your hand and feet was not an ideal but there is little to no pain.Yes a pinch here and there but gone in a millisecond. The benefit of Acupuncture and Visiting Paramount Acupuncture is second to none.

Best thing I have done for myself and my health.<//review>

Best Acupuncture in Town!! Dr. Lee is there to help you and advice you of what is the right care for you. Dr. Lee is a highly skilled considerate and very caring Acupuncturist. He works very closely with his assistant Evelyn, the young lady that will greet you in the main entrance and will make sure you feel comfortable at all times. I highly recommend this Acupuncture and Wellness Office.< /review>

Another great experience with Dr.Lee. This time I had a warming treatment done by Evelyn (I believe that was her name) and she was so pleasant and described everything she was doing. That is one of the great things about this office. You always know what’s going on and what to expect. The whole ambiance is very relaxing and calming. I always look forward to my next treatment!</review>

<Review>I started coming to Paramount Acupuncture for massage. After a while, Dr. Lee recommended acupuncture to treat several health issues I was experiencing throughout 2018. In November, I fell at work and injured my cervical spine and suffered nerve damage in my dominant hand and arm. I was in bad shape. I started seeing Dr. Lee weekly to help with pain management for my injuries. Eventually, my workman's comp doctors ordered acupuncture as part of my recovery therapies. Dr. Lee and his staffed worked with the workman's comp insurance so that I could continue my treatment under his care. My pain has significantly decreased and I have recovered a majority of nerve function. I am extremely grateful to Dr. Lee for his incredible care over the past year and couldn't be more pleased with the attention and kindness of his amazing staff. I highly recommend Paramount Acupuncture .<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I visited Dr. Lee because I had sleeping during my pregnancy. I did not want to take sleep pills while pregnant. He helped me sleep naturally without medication. He also has a massage therapist team that help me get rid of leg cramps I was getting during my pregnancy. I plan to continue to visit this place to help me recover quickly after the baby is born. My father recommended this place. He has been going to Dr. Lee for many years. All the staff here is courteous and respectful. The location is clean and they play a very nice indian flute music that helps me fall asleep during my massage.<//Text>

<Review>I was beyond impressed with my experience at  Paramount Acupunctures office. My first contact was with the front desk receptionists and I was completely blown away by how helpful and kind they were and how they got back to me! A lot of doctors don’t realize how important it is to have excellent administration. The first point of contact is crucial!

Now on to the appointment… my appointment ran on time, Dr Lee was really knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment! I would highly recommend this acupuncture place to anyone who wants to be taken care of with excellent service therefore I give them 5 stars, by far the best acupuncture place I have been to.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< time>

< Review>
I'm so thankful for all of the reviews thanks to that I chose to receive care at this clinic. I have a back injury and was diagnosed with bursitis in July of this year. I can gladly say my leg/hip pain is gone! My back problem will always be a part if my life but thanks to Dr. Lee and his skilled staff, I get pain relief without the side effects of taking anti inflammatory medications or pain medications. If you are suffering with an injury, or illness don't loose hope and give oriental medicine a try. So blessed to have found this place!</Review>

<Review>I’ve been mailing parcels and letters from this location for a year and haven’t encountered any difficulties. The staff do a great job!

USPS will provide you boxes if ordered online which makes it a breeze to pack things ahead of time. Otherwise bring your own packing materials (tape, scissors, etc) to finish the job on site. There is a self service station for domestic packages and they do money orders and passport photos here too. Plenty of free parking.</Review>< date>

The receptionist spent quite some time doing math and came up with stamps of $12.35 and I said so be it.  Then I was told there's no tracking info for that as "we don't know when it will be shipped."  Regardless I told them this has been done so many times (USPS actually sell prepaid priority envelopes w/tracking) I was shut down and the folks were really impatient like I should never challenge their knowledge.  I decided to leave and got it done in another USPS place in Palo Alto (got exact postage and a tracking number on my prepaid envelope).  The passport application in this location is painless though.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>I use this post office all the time.  The staff there is very knowledgeable, courteous and helpful.  Three staff members I have gotten to know pretty well.  They always help me find the cheapest way to mail something.  Today one of them noticed that I had too much postage on one envelope and not enough on another one.  I said I would buy more stamps to cover the one that was low, but she instead gently peeled the extra stamp off my over-stamped letter and put the stamp on my under-stamped letter!  They often do kind things like that for me and I'm so grateful. Today a woman was yelling at one of my favorite staff members - I wish I'd been able to think of what to say to defend the staff.  Please, can we all remember that our USPS workers have to follow rules - they can't change rules for us (that's what this woman wanted today).  Also, the USPS worked extremely hard to make sure our mail-in ballots got delivered on time even when they had many obstacles put in their way.  Thank you USPS!  -- One week later, I went back to the post office again today and there was yet another extremely rude customer!  I don't know how the staff stays so calm and helpful.  This time the rude customer refused to wear a mask even though it is required and the post office was full -- two of us asked her politely to wear it and she just said, "I'm staying six feet away" and shrugged. The post office worker asked her and she complied.  This same worker was so helpful, saved me money and helped the people ahead of me with sealing up their package.  Wish I could give another 5 stars!<//review>< gmap_id>

They would make a french post office jealous! They are slow, under staffed, not specially pleasant, often they are lost in their own products. You would think that when they see 10 people waiting for 10 mins they would rush ... but no! Maybe I miss it and this is just the business which is like this worldwide!< /Text>

This office is perfect, the staff is very polite and helpful. I went to my passport appointment, and the lady took the picture, but she made sure I really liked that picture if not she would take another one. They even wait for me ,because I forgot all my papers so I had to go back home and then come back. I really appreciate that . Those five stars are well earned 🙂<//review>

I wish I could give 0 stars. This place is the epitome of incompetence. I had an amazon package that apparently could not be delivered because nobody was home - this was not the case (people were home!). I was then told to go pick up the package at this post office location on Bayshore. I got there and waited 10-15 minutes for an employee to find the package. They told me they could not find it. It is a true shame that a public institution could have such a bad reputation. This post office is known as being one of the worst on the Peninsula - I concur!< /Review>

<Text>This post office is literally the pit of all lost, misplaced or undelivered packages. The staff is horribly rude and unhelpful. You will never get to speak to anyone that can help at a tier 2 or above level and there is such a language barrier, that you will not be able to communicate well.

TLDR, this place is bad. Avoid at all costs.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Worst Post Office. No postmaster or station manager since last year. The office never answers the phone and that was pre-pandemic. All employees yell at customers when they don't UNDERSTAND simple requests or inquiries. Very rude employees with no professionalism. Also employees will give out personal information regarding anyone. The Hispanic woman who works there always gives me not so pleasant looks everytime I'm there. As if she is trying to intimadate me. She is very obvious about it. She will literally watch me everytime, it's really annoying. She also gave my personal information to a third-party. Employees act as if the customers are a bother. USPS needs to step in.<//Review><GmapID>0x808fbba61a81b2e9:0xd8926234ff5cd692< /GmapID>< resp>

Why are nearly all the employees and mail carriers working for the Palo Alto post offices Chinese?😡 I thought racial discrimination in the workplace is against the law.
The clerks working the counter are always arrogant and unfriendly, and they block you from contacting the Post Master there.</text>

<Text>They have repeatedly lost packages of mine.  Especially prescription medicine requiring a signature.  I am filing a police report.  I have called for the last half hour, calling again when the phone disconnects, and no one answers the phone during working hours.  I have never left a 1-star review but this is highly deserved.  We pay enough to live in Palo Alto and should have at least a moderately reliable post office.  This one is an embarrassment to the United States.< /Text>< Pics>

This location has lost more than ten packages of mine in the past year. They put a slip in my mailbox saying the "package was not deliverable because no one was home" even though I am! Or  saying that the mailbox is full when it isn't. When I go to the post office to pick up the package with the slip, they say it isn't there and they can't find it! They always take my information and say they will call back but never do!<//text>

Famously bad USPS service as it is. But this location has the worst service of all. The staff are stealing, I lost a package there, the camera has showed my stuff was in their warehouse, but they couldn't find it. I wonder the 5 star rating was conducted by whoever works there. The Asian guy helped me there, super bad service.< /Text>

Needed to send an international package. Post office did not have a single customs form for packages under 4 lbs. Clerk checked all the drawers in all counters and the back, I checked all the form containers in the "outside" area. Not a single one.

Clerk was polite about it, but in the end USPS couldn't process my package.< /Review>

Probably just really poorly managed.  Also, very few people that work at the desk barely speak English.  If you are a customer facing and client-oriented employee then you should be able to communicate clearly.  I was helped when I was there by a very helpful woman in the back warehouse area, who helped me make an appointment for later. I've been trying the last few days to cancel my appointment for Passport help, however, to no avail.  I wanted to add to the string of no-answer complaints.  I've had the same experience as others where the phone is almost always busy, or no-one answers the phone at the end of the day.  Sorry if anybody was trying to make an appointment for a passport for tomorrow. Maybe do a walk in and try your luck.< /text>

One customer complained loudly and unreasonably while the employee behind the counter kept asking her to get in line before she could be helped. "I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to someone else!", said customer. Sigh.

Employee recognized the long line and eventually called out the manager to handle the situation so that he could help the next in line.

Fast service, really nice employees.</Text>

I unfortunately had a terrible experience with this post office at two different instances. The first situation occurred when I waited at home for a package that was guaranteed to arrive by 12:00 on a given day and actually arrived at 4 pm. This usually wouldn't be a problem, but the post person dishonestly reported that the package was delivered at 11:15, so the money was not refundable - and it was incredibly time sensitive. Not to mention that I ended up having to take off work because the package was late.

The second instance is even worse. I waited at home again one day to receive a guaranteed priority package. The post person delivered one of my packages, but not the second priority package. They did, however, mark that the package had been delivered, which I know was not true because I was sitting outside when the other package was delivered. I went to the post office two days later (arriving an hour early to make sure I would be able to talk to someone as soon as it opened), and the person behind the counter raised their voice telling me the package hadn't been delivered yet and that I needed to be patient. When he took a deep breath and looked at the tracking information he realized he had read the information incorrectly. Rather than apologize he said, let me get my supervisor. He returned several minutes later saying his supervisor wouldn't talk to me until 9 pm (which didn't work for an individual with work).

I filed a report and attempted to call the post office numerous times, only to be put on hold for hours or not answered. So incredibly frustrating. Especially because I have used USPS for years and never experienced this before. The report I filed was later changed to "Resolved" even though I was not contacted or explained how...

The package is gone, and I will likely never find it.</Text>

Disappointed that the lobby was not opened to 9:10 am today (7/11/15) - not the posted 7:00 am opening.   When I contacted the delivery folks through the side fence, it turned out that the supervisor was on the loading dock.  A female delivery person had to cajole him to get the doors open.  ugh.

Let's try to do better!<//review>

I wanted to mail a parcel and visited this office twice today, once in the morning and again in the afternoon. On both occasions, the post office was full of people waiting to have passport processing, which made the environment rather oppressive. There was only one person serving on the counter. When anyone had finished with their passport application, they had to come out of the passport admin room to pay their fee. They did this by cutting the mail counter line (not their fault) to pay, and then going back into the passport admin room. Needless to say, this resulted in the mail counter line going nowhere.  I waited 15 minutes in line the first time I visited, and not one single customer had their business completed in that time. Though I only had three people in front of me, I gave up. The second time I visited, there were at least 10 people in the mail counter line, so I didn't even join it (there was still only one person serving). Appalling service.<//review>

<review>I was here for the past few days to renew my passport and came before 2:00PM. However, when the time reached 2.00 PM, the lady told all the people waiting in line to leave. Today, she said she was leaving at 1:30 so everyone (about 8 people) except for the first two people in line should come the next day, but according to USPS she should be helping people until 2:00 PM.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>Called 30 minutes ago (11/24/15 at 10:15am) to verify the status of a package that did not arrive at my business due to the weekend. No one picked up for 5 minutes, then I got a curt "one moment please" to my request. I put the phone on full volume/speaker and continued to do other work at my desk. I nearly forgot about the call on hold, and hung up 25 minutes later when no one picked up the phone. Awful service.</Text><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x808fbba61a81b2e9:0xd8926234ff5cd692<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

People were waiting in a long line but the passport office did not open the door even 5 minutes after 9am. This can be much better as public service.< /Text>

The employees here are joke. Rude, short tempered, uneducated and super slow. I will drive right past this place to another post office even though my son goes to school right next door. I have had over 5 horrible experiences here. Someone please come and help this branch understand what customer service and just being a decent human being is all about. This is the type of place that give government employees a bad name.</text>

<Text>This branch is one of the few that didn't require an appointment for passport renewals. I knew better than to arrive close to cloing time. I arrived right before 9am, only to find 4 families ahead of me. The office didn't open until 9:07. However, after the first family was admitted, someone came out and made sure that everyone's paperwork was in order, that they had the right payment, documentation, photos, etc. When he came to me, he told me that my renewal didn't have to go through the office, but my daughter's did. He helped me get my mail application ready and mailed it off to Philadelphia. My daughter didn't lose her place in line. The other families in line were friendly, which helped pass the time. We were out of there in 50 minutes.

The Passport office is open 9am - 3pm, but there are breaks from 11-11:20 and lunch from 1 to 1:30. Monday and Fridays are the busiest.< /Text><rate>4< /rate><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I called on December 15, 2014 at 8:47am. I called three times. After connecting, the phone line was automatically disconnected.

Prior to my trip, I called to arrange for "hold mail". But my mail kept coming according to my neighbor.

When the post office cannot be reached and even after getting through cannot execute a simple order, its credibility is dented.</review>< pictures>

Very rude.  They've never been helpful in any meaningful way.  And excruciatingly slow.  Thankfully, we've shifted nearly all our parcels to UPS and FedEx now, so it's rare I have to visit the USPS.<//text>

I love these guys. I am an eBay seller so I use this location all the time. The job these people do is as impossible as it is thankless. There is a certain amount of patience that is required to do business here, and there is a maze of confusing postal regulations that can give anyone a headache, but all in all the system works, and these guys get er done. Best to give a little lead time for your visit because there is likely to be a waiting line. In my experience, not as bad as the wait downtown or the Camebridge location.< /text>

I ordered a 10-key for my laptop two weeks ago. It was shipped USPS last week. According to the USPS tracking site, it went out for delivery on Monday the 20th. It is now Friday the 24th, and it still hasn't arrived. I went to the USPS main office (which is only a few miles away) during my lunch break. They don't have it. And the clerk's suggestion is that the driver must have it on the truck.
Incompetence.< /text>

<text>The WORST!  Unfriendly, un helpful, and most i importantly disorganized and doing a very bad job.

Packages cannot be found, mail is not held despite a filled from.

The management is unresponsive and when the usps provided a form for a redelivery of a package, and I filled it--and had confirmation--it was IGNORED.

I think the management is horrible and someone from above should step in--and change this post office.

To mail stuff out I go to the post offices in Menlo Park or Los Altos.  It is a world of difference.  Unfortunately I cannot change my post office that delivers my mail.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The 30th as soon as they opened cause I had time before work to go, just to find out MY PACKAGES WERE SHIPPED BACK TO SENDER THURS. THE 28 AFTER TELLING ME THERE WOULD BE A 15 DAY HOLD

<text>AVOID THIS USPS LOCATION AT ALL COST !!!

IF I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS I WOULD!!!

USPS PALO ALTO CA --- MISSING PACKAGE AND BAD EMPLOYEE !!!! ---

-on 6/31/15 i called them to ask where my package was because the tracking information wasn't working online. when i called i was told that the package was picked up from the shippers mailbox and was on the way.

-7/3/15 i called to see where it was because the shipping label was for two days and it should have been here by now, when i called i was told that the package was picked up from the mailbox and that it was on the way but they could not see where it went, then the lady told me she would transfer me to someone. after waiting for 10 minutes to be transfered, another lady picked up the phone .
she asked how may i help you but she was another lady from the post office , not who i was supposed to be transferred too . i told her what was going on with my package and she said that the package was never picked up, only the label was created. when i asked her why the other lady had told me it was picked up she was baffled!! she had no idea why the first lady told me that.
the other lady working there said it was picked up ! she told me TWICE !!!!
something is going on within this branch that s not right!!!
After speaking with the second lady she told me a delivery supervisor would be calling me back , and guess what they never did

7/4/15- tday i called again because the supervisor never called me back ! IT TOOK ME 16 TIMES TO CALL THEM AND TO GET AN ANSWER !!! TWO OF THOSE TIMES I WAS ANSWERED THEN HUNGUP ON !!!
the same lady i talked to originally  told me my package was picked up on the 21st and she doesn't know where it went but she can't do anything so she said she would have the supervisor call me when they get there.. needless to say i don't think ill be getting that call.

i now have a $60 pair of pants missing now that i will never be refunded for . THANKS USPS for the horrible service and bad employees !

starting to think this location steals customers packages !!!!!!!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The employee (lady) in the passport office is just rude! I had scheduled an appointment about 2 weeks ago and I called in to verify my appointment and she never scheduled me one. So I asked to schedule me another one and she wanted me to go in in another 3 weeks so I told her I didn't want it and I was going to walk in and she told me good luck. The other employee (lady) behind the counter has the same attitude I rather drive 5 more miles to another post office.</Text>

I'm waiting on a package that has been out for delivery for four days.  I have been calling the post office and have yet to get an answer.
I'm worried that this package will end up missing like so many other reviews that I have just read.  Avoid this post office at all costs !</Text>

I give my gratitude for Corey who was superb as my motorcycle accident lawyer. He and Manuel worked my Lancaster case for a long time and got me compensated. Without these two, I would be lost today. 5 stars for their hard work and professionalism.< /review>

<Review>I got a tons of scrapes and bruising from a bad motorcycle accident I was in. My insurance was not going to help me so I decided to hire a motorcycle accident lawyer that would be able to help out. After tireless searching, I stumbled upon Corey. He was the best possible lawyer I could have hired!! He did the works on my case and settled it out for just the right amount.<//Review>< Pics>

I feared the worst when my son got into a car accident. He went to the hospital and luckily nothing serious so he was released. He woke up the next day real sore and I knew it was time to get a car accident lawyer. We hired Chris together and I cannot explain how great he has been. It's beyond words what he has achieved.<//review>

Amazing service!!! Was in need of an attorney for a personal injury and Donald was very helpful with my free consultation, hearing out what happened and answering all my questions without shutting me out like other attorneys did. Even after our conversation I had some questions and he called me back. Very thankful they took my case and will definitely be referring them to family and friends.<//Review>

Cliff went above and beyond in helping us with our claim. We were dealing with a insurance company that wanted to put us thru the ringer and give us barely any compensation for our vehicle and time without our vehicle. He made himself available for us and took his time explaining the process ahead of us. He kept us up to date with phone calls and emails. He really went above and beyond for us I would recommend him as the best car accident lawyer to anyone looking for an attorney.</review>

<Review>Very happy that I found their number while doing a search on the internet. After viewing multiple websites, as well as, their own, I chose them because of the ratings I had found. The receptionist was friendly, quick and professional, and I was quickly connected to a free consultation with an Attorney. Andrew was very helpful as we reviewed all of the facts from my accident from a month and a half ago. He presented multiple options on how to proceed from where I was in the process and discussed several options in depth. He listened to my concerns, and we came to an agreement to retain his firm, as well as discussing the next step in the process. He advised me that their investigator would contact shortly after our conversation, and gave me a direct number in case I needed to contact him at any time.
The Investigator Eric contacted very quickly and set up an appointment to come to me two days later. He was very professional and advised me of much of the information he would need for the interview, as well as the expected length. He contacted me the day before, as he might be late, as well as the morning of the interview, to let me know when he would arrive. Eric was courteous and professional as he requested each piece of information. He carefully reviewed the required information, and then the contract for retaining the Attorney. He thanked me for my time, and carefully answered any questions I had, or referred me to the Attorney, who would personally handle the rest of my case.
All in all, each individual I have had contact with has been professional, courteous, and caring, going out of their way to listen, and provide needed information for traversing this exhaustive process. They truly show that they are in your corner.<//Review>< Rating>

<review>After a car accident, I didn't plan on hiring a lawyer....my mistake! Two years later the insurance company was leading and controlling me. I went to Derek at I Car Accident Lawyer in Palmdale. He didn't pressure me to choose him, but just laid out what he could accomplish for me. He had the knowledge and expertise to get results. The pressures of dealing with the insurance companies was gone. When Derek was done, my bills were paid and I received a very nice settlement from both insurance companies for my injuries and lost work time. I'm glad I went to this motorcycle lawyer and would recommend him to anyone!</review>< Name>

Mr. Cliff fought for and did the work and negotiating with a hostile insurance company and won $1.000.000.  Very proud to know him. He fought and my family can't thank him enough.

I was very satisfied with the service from my accident attorney. I Called for the free consultation line and the lawyer was very helpful, he listened to the whole story before deciding if I had a case or not. Other places just take a few details because its a "free" consultation,  In Palmdale and Lancaster this is a competent car accident firm.< /review>

I was recently involved in car accident in Palmdale. I called the Car Accident Lawyer Pro's and was on the line with an attorney within a few moments. They were very professional and helpful.

DO NOT SHOP HERE!  Bought $78.00 worth of clothing including a T-shirt.  Washed the shirt before wearing and found the bottom seam unraveling.  They refused to just exchange the shirt because it was washed even though it had never been worn.  Is this any way to do business?< /Review>

<user>110910135489456112123</user><review>Whatever you do DO NOT SHOP HERE. You are better off going to Wal-Mart or Target. They have a 7day exchange only policy here which was fine. I went 3 days later and they refused to return my items because I had the single tag off. They accused me of wearing it all day. When all I did was try it on at home and decided I needed a smaller size. Keep in mind I spent $80 here!! What a waste of money. They wouldn't make the exception.
Oh and the experience shopping there initially was horrible. They make you feel rushed and like you are going to steal their clothes. Watching your every move. The cashier's act like it's their store and will stink eye you the whole time. Horrible customer service!! 1st and last time I will ever shop there.< /review></record>

<Review>If u love pro club and/or pro 5 men underwear, u will absolutely love this store. It's quite small but packed with lots of goodies.
Very clean...very friendly helpers. Answered any questions I had in where r ur...? Very friendly!
A 2 pack pro club underwear, was $7.99. 3 to 4 pairs of socks per pack were 3 packs for $10.99 or $12.12:with tax.
The parking could get a little stranded. But overall, a great shopping experience. Highly recommended.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Typically, this place is a great place to buy work clothes, long sleeves, plain tees, anything that you don’t mind getting dirty because it’s a pretty good price.
I’ve been shopping here for years for exactly those kinds of things. Typically 3-400 dollars a year.

However, last week, Jan 31st 2019, I bought a 50 dollar Dickies jacket to use for work, since I didn’t want my nice Carhart jacket to get wrecked.
I wore it the next day (a Friday) for a couple hours in the morning, and then a couple hours in the morning on a Monday.(today)
When I took it off, I noticed the armpit area had completely ripped apart leaving a 7 or 8” vent in the stitches.
“Looks like I’ll be heading back to exchange it” I said to myself.
We got off early due to rain, so I stopped by.
Went to the counter, with my receipt that I still had in my wallet. Explained that things happen and there is bound to be a flaw in at least one jacket out of the millions  that Dickies makes every year.
The two ladies who work there, told me
“Noooooo, this old jacket. This not new jacket”
“It’s dirty, this not new”

I explained to them that, yes it’s dirty, I’m a welder and clothes get dirty, that doesn’t mean it’s old.

She accused me of using my receipt to return an older jacket.

I told her “why would I do that? This is a work jacket, dirt and a tiny burn hole I’m not concerned with. But when the armpit rips apart after only a couple hours of use, there’s obviously a flaw in how it was built.”
I showed her my Carhart jacket that I was wearing and it has numerous burn marks and worn fabric, and explained I don’t care that it’s going to get dirty, I care if the thing falls apart before getting a reasonable amount of use out of it.

Well, as you guessed, they told me to pretty much kick rocks, because they won’t exchange it.

So BUYER BEWARE, what ever you buy there, you’re stuck with it. All their return or exchange policies that they post mean nothing, because they don’t care. They won’t honor anything.

There’s dozens of other surplus stores in the Los Angeles area. Guess they don’t want to keep their customers happy.<//text><rate>1< /rate><user>107093851818650257193</user>< Time>

Some stuff is reasonably priced. But I felt that a price I was given to have a custom hoodie made was pricey. So I choose not to do it with them.<//Review>

< Review>
They sold me shorts that are tagged as one size but labeled as another and when I went back 24 hrs later with reciept...they REFUSED to exchange...not return for refund but exchange for correct size and said that I need to take it up with manufacturer.  Very dirty business...shady...dishonest and rude. Once they get your money...they don't care about you or the product that they peddle.</Review>

<Review>Delicious Greek food for the entire family that will not break your budget! Cooked to perfection and customized as requested. The Gyros and meat plates are excellent! The rice is seasoned perfectly and goes along as a great side dish. Friendly service and meal was prepared in the time quoted. Easy pick up process after ordering. Definitely recommend this awesome location!<//Review>< pics>

< review>
They were very helpful about vegan options. We tried a vegan wrap and a vegan plate. Really good hummus! Falafel is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside -delicious!  They need eco-friendly take-out boxes. Otherwise I highly recommend. Very tasty!</review>

Price is not bad, everything was really fresh, wait time was not too bad either. Some parking is availabe, shouldn't be a problem. It is a small shop, is on the end near the street. Its across from Safeway and is blue and white shop I believe. The service was friendly and smiling faces. Nice atmosphere so we ate inside. We had the cannoli things for dessert, sorry no picture but they were good.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuf_8TJJVJHHX3E1I3kGbQ1_EUg7ht9457ihvu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

I never pick what I want because I like having them pick what's for my meal. The one way you get to try new things that you wouldn't  normally. I haven't  gotten anything  i haven't  like.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>Bad bad bad Customer service!  While they made what the computer system' said, I did NOT and have NEVER ordered falafel; especially $54 worth and a tip!!  And further, why would I call and say my order was wrong if it was right!?!? It was 330pm.  This is the third time my order has been wrong, the other 2 were incomplete!  And for a while the help has has poor attitudes not matter how hard I try.  So sad because I am happy to support local but the 3rd time is NOT the charm for me.  I hope your look will be better.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I was there earlier and ordered a veggie combo meal with half falafel, hummus, salad, dolmas, and rice. The falafel was a bit burnt. I also ordered 4 pieces of original baklava for $10, which is overpriced, but on their brochure list of prices menu says it’s $2 for an original. I love middle eastern and Greek food, but I’m disappointed.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Getting better.  Still if you're going to charge a dollar per Dolma they should be pretty darn good you can get them for 15 cents a piece in the can and I can't tell the difference.< /review>

First time getting food here. Had similar food down in Visalia the previous day and searched for a like restaurant when I got home because I loved that place so much. Glad that I was just as pleased with Go Falafel. Super fresh, super tasty, good prices, quick service. I want to try the whole menu!<//text>

<Text>Over priced. Charge an additional $2.50 for feta cheese in Gyro adds up when buying for family and u would think that feta cheese shouldn't be an additional charge u gotta have it in ur Gyro but anyway salad in my plate came with no sauce and old lady behind the register thought I was pregnant. I mean I did have a baby few weeks ago but I lost over 20 pounds so last thing I wanna hear hella rude. If you go to Winco they have all ingredients for Gyros and tbh way better then here.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1614222572925, 'text': 'Feta has been $1.50 for 8 years now, if there is an issue with the receipt feel free to come in and refund if there is an extra charge.'}</Resp><GmapID>0x80900d15a5f145f9:0x2c2daddde189f00f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I work here and everything is made right away as soon as the ticket is printed. Most orders are done 15 to 20 minuets. The owners and staff are friendly and will work with you during your order. The Gyro meat is cut from its standing grill unlike other places where the meat look like thin slices. Its a bit pricey but the food is excellent and great. If you want a lot of fries I suggest you order xtra fries. If you want xtra meat they can do that at an xtra price. Furthermore check out the menu and order or you can come sit outside and enjoy your meal. We also thank our customers and those that wait in line ready to order.<//Review>

Great first sampler of what they have. They have a full bakery here, too! Combo packs of homemade style Greek pastries. Also they have a case to choose from. Their catering platters look super reasonably priced. They had unique drinks in there case, too. Don't let the cluttered dinning area fool you, its good.< /Review><date>1583967922502</date>< GmapID>

Nit being from Stockton myself we have started eating at local restaurants for a number of reasons.  The inside is a bit tight but there is plenty of seating outside. The close quarters allow you to overhear the family oriented vibes from the staff. The food was great and service was quick. We will surely be making more stops.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Go Falafel Greek Food

Located on the corner of Alpine and Pacific Ave. In Stockton, CA

They do have an IG @Gofalafelgreekfood

Here's our Story;

This review is from January of 2019. I wasn't really writing back then. But I've been inspired since September, 6th of this year. So here goes my review.

So I got this flier about Stockton restaurant week. I checked online and picked out places I was going to take my children.

Asked my youngest Princess if she wanted to come here. She said yeah and threw up the deuce.

Note: There's a reason we (My Children and I)  throw up the peace sign. It's our way of approval or really liking something.

I knew what I wanted right off that bat. I wanted a Gyro. Now I attempted to make them (Gyros) at home, but my Gyros end up looking like a Soft Taco, lol. But the Gyro here, was on point. Especially because I threw some fries inside.

My youngest daughter, ordered Chicken Souvlaki with pita bread. Fries and va bottled water. The chicken Souvlaki is like a chicken skewer or kabob. I'm from the hood and we just call it meat on a stick.  I loved watching her stuff the pita bread with chicken and fries. We always get creative and mix food together on our plate. I  love spending time with my kids.

It's pretty small inside and cozy perfect for a date. Swoon. Bring your boo for a nice one on one.

They do take card and cash. Customer service was pretty good and our food didn't take long.

It was in January and the weather was cold outside and Go Falafel Greek Food hit the spot. Everything always comes together for us. So I did have a memorable moment with my youngest daughter. Good Company And Good Food go hand in hand.

Yes, I'm a fan and definitely be back.

<user_name>Chris Banuelos< /user_name><time>1595697687734< /time><Rate>1</Rate><review>Mr brother and I decided to try the food here for the first time since our usual place Kabob and Gyro House in downtown stockton closed at 7 and doesn't open on weekends. We placed an order online at 6:52pm and we arrived around 7:40pm to pick up the order which said it would be ready 7:14-7:30. When we arrived I told them I was there to pick up an online order and they seemed confused. I let them know that I had ordered through yelp/grubhub, they checked their iPad and then told me my order wasn't ready yet.

I don't think they had any of my order ready and barely started to cook everything after I had arrived. This might not have been their fault but perhaps they weren't paying attention to online orders coming in. This wasn't a huge deal as we weren't in a hurry but I was surprised they hadn't made an order that was placed 40mins ago and the place wasn't even busy. It was almost closing time so I was a bit concerned and hoped that they still had enough fresh ingredients for my order.

When I got home I joked to my family that I hope they cooked everything thoroughly because they had to make everything quickly before closing time. About 3 hours after eating the food I started to get a painful stomach ache and then threw up about five times. I'm pretty sure this food made me sick or gave me food poisoning because it was the only thing I had eaten for several hours and the only food I actually threw up.

The whole ordering experience and ordeal after eating the food and getting sick forces me to give Go Falafel one star. The food itself didn't taste too bad although the portions were a bit overpriced for what you get.

For example the gyro wrap that I got had one piece of tomato, a ton of lettuce and a few strands of meat. Definitely not worth it for the $9 they charge for this item. The usual place i go to charges around $7 for the same item but they put a lot more meat, other veggies and don't stuff it full of mainly lettuce.

I also thought the kabob combo platter was disappointing as they only put like 2 pieces of each meat and the majority of the platter was humus, tzatziki sauce, and a salad. The lettuce in the salad was bitter and the humus was really watery, I'm not sure if they watered it down or what but all the humus I've eaten is usually a bit thicker consistency.

I will never be returning here and will instead be going to Kabob and Gyro House even if I have to wait since they close earlier and on weekends. The quality, hospitality and price at Kabob and Gyro House is so much better and you can even see them cooking your food fresh so you know it's made to order and hygienic.< /review>< pictures>

Greek fries are yummy!  The Hummus is the best I have tasted in years!  I ordered a salad that I couldn't eat right away, drove around with it in the car for an afternoon - got home late and saved it for the next day's dinner - the lettuce was still fresh and crisp - one word DELICIOUS.< /Text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Very clean, very friendly staff, big varied menu, great prices & the food was ready quick. We went during restaurant week & ordered one of each; gyro, beef wrap, chicken shawarma & falafel. I did not give 5 stars due to 2 out of the 4 items containing more vegetables smothered in sauce than meat. The pita tasted fresh, soft & delicious. I did like how they each tasted different & the one with hummus was delicious. I recommend a falafel & gyro. Even though the gyro was mild on overall flavor. The garlic fries are full of garlic flavor & garlic topping which is difficult to find in Stockton. I'll be back for a falafel & garlic fries!<//review>< pictures>

I had the classic gyro, and we both ordered a Greek salad, (which included a falafel), dolmathakia, hummus, and pita bread. The owners and staff are very friendly and helpful, and they keep it clean and tidy. We will definitely return! :)</text>< pictures>

<resp>None<//resp><review>OMG...yup...a real deal here! I got the gyro to go...it was huge!! Huge and Juicy and like way I mean...like waaaaay good. It's a corner store, blue trim building. Plenty of parking. I walked in and was greeted right away from a cheery lady in the back. I figured she was the owner, I read the reviews before I went. I ordered my food and in 10 minutes I read more reviews about the desserts and how awesome they ate- so I couldn't resist and I bought 4 yummy baklava. I came home devoured my gyro, actually half, I have half left fir munchie time later! I took a bite of the baklava and it was so good, it melted in my mouth. Yummy yummy. I swear the Gyro I ate was the BEST one ever! Thanks for the great food and warm and friendly service. I'll be back soon!!</review>< Time>

The whole family has not been taught to use gloves. Wife has no hair net. The sausage and gyros sit at room temperature for hours upon serving. I fear for the health of future customers as well as those who are here in the past.< /text>

Delicious Greek fast food! My son had his first ever gyro and loved it, while I had a combo wrap (gyro meat,  beef and chicken shwarma, all wrapped up with lettuce, pesto, tatziki, and various veggies. Really good!

Service is warm and friendly, and there's indoor seating and a nice outdoor patio to enjoy beautiful weather while you eat.</text>

This place is not only run by one of the coolest families to ever be in this town but for all you big eaters out there they serve plates that are right up your alley and if you're not such a big year you got leftovers for later but they have a couple of menu items that will blow your mind so you're guaranteed to want to come back a second time talk to the owner she's always at the register tell her what you're thinking if you don't know the menu or you're a little intimidated that's the person to start learning from and I don't have to say any of this stuff cuz I'm a barbecue pit kind of guy this is now next to Sushi my new go-to this is the place<//review>

I ordered food from this place and it was HORRIBLE! My food felt seemed like it was microwaved. My sauce for my ramch sauce was smashed into my side of tzaki sauce in my plate and my napkin had a big hole ripped out in the middle. Not worth the money or time WAITING on this food.<//Review>

I don't know which is better the owners or the food they make a couple of off-menu items I've never had before at a Greek place that will blow your mind forget that the Falafel is bomb and that the Gyros stand up against a lot of others but they make this rap that has like five meats in it french fries I think drinkers would love it</review>

<text>We love the family that runs this place, they make you like family as well upon entering the door. They are very helpful if you have any questions about any food, there were many choices I had not heard of. I tried the gyros, falafels, and chicken on a stick (I cannot for the life of me remember the name of it) all were delicious, we will be returning customers as long as they stay ooen!<//text>< pics>

Since my wife has begun a plant based diet, we have found it difficult to locate healthy, vegetarian options at restaurants in town. Go Falafel helps us fit that bill quite nicely. Their vegetarian options, particularly their falafel in a pita or on a salad, make the trip very worthwhile. The falafel sandwich is tasty and filled with lettuce,  tomatoes,  onions and the surprising crunch of turnips. Of course, the fried hummus balls round out the whole thing.  I like that the restaurant is close to home and they have a food truck. A very good choice for healthy eating in Stockton.</Text>

The meat they serve is very tough but they try to hide the fact by adding tooo much seasonings. Very poor quality food overall.</text>

Family owned local business serving delicious and fresh  Greek / middle eastern Mediterranean cuisine. Very clean, reasonably priced and great friendly service. Best vegan falafel and combo platter of tender, juicy, flavorful kabobs and chicken I have tasted and thoroughly enjoyed their homemade baklava, so many varieties of baklava generously filled with nuts. Indoor and outdoor seating available.
Highly recommend....< /review>< Pictures>

Omg ! I’ve heard so many things about gyros and shawarma’s that I decided to try it. I’m so glad I did and I’m so glad I made Go Falafel the place. This is soo good ! You guys have definitely gained a new customer :)</text>

<text>I have been getting food at Go Falafal for several months.  When they were working out of the truck, the products were always fresh.  Last two times I ordera salad, they served.rhe salad with browned lettuce, soggy & overripe tomaties, and old cabbage.  I hope that Go Falafel doesnt lose quality for quantity as I love the fresh, handmade nature of their food.  Third times is the charm.  One more try and if salad fixings arent fresh, I will stop patronizing their business!< /text><user>113410600176623910688</user>< resp>

< Review>
Don't Use Dutton Plumbing! We had a terrible experience with Dutton Plumbing! Out of urgency, took advantage of their well-advertised $73 drain cleaning. They were very professional, COVID protocols in place and timely. However, diagnosed a major problem, which would immediately cost over $900 as a short-term fix, then diagnosed a clean out drain pipe replacement issue, which would have cost us $10,000-$20,000+!! When I pushed back on the $900, technician said he could talk to his supervisor and probably reduce the cost to $600ish. Nope! I asked them to send me the bid in writing and I was going to get a second opinion. Never received the bid, no follow up phone call, nothing. Called another plumber, referred by a friend and guess what...our pipes are fine, there are no immediate issues and the clean out pipe DOES NOT need replacing! In talking to friends, they've had similar experiences with Dutton. Disappointing, to say the least! How many people have they taken advantage of?? I responded to their survey about the service and no response.< /Review>

I was charged $395 to repair a pipe in the backyard that had broke at the connection point to another pipe. They were here for about an hour. The plumber was professional and very nice. Company provided photo of whom I should expect. Overall great customer service but severely overpriced, especially since only the connector pipe was replaced and originally pipe was reattached. The price would prevent me from using services in the future. I had to have the main water turned off due to pipe break at the section, so shopping for a better price was limited due to time constraint.<//review>

We have been part of the Dutton plumbing "family" since 2008; obviously, we are happy with them!  Yesterday, was the BEST experience ever.  For our yearly maintenance, they sent Technician Roth Foster.  Roth was not only professional and thorough, but took the time to explain problems that he saw.  To make it easier, Roth took photos of the problems to help us understand what needed to be done.  I want Roth to be "our technician" always!<//text>

<Text>I found a leak in my garage pipe and needed to fix as soon as possible.  I found Dutton Plumbing on the internet.  They were quick to respond and were very pleasant on the phone and the tech was very pleasant as well.  I received a quote to fix the leak of $540.  Since I needed it fixed I didn't question it. After speaking with my husband it just didn't sound right. They replaced 8 inches of copper pipe 1 joint 1 elbow and sweat 4 connections. It took 45 minutes start to finish. Then the tech talked me into a $79 dollar yearly family plan that really only gives me 10% off future purchases. I called the operator and questioned the $79 dollar charge and was told that my repair would have been higher if I did not purchase the plan?????  At this point I was so frustrated I just let it go but I really do feel I was taken advantage of because of the timing (2 days before xmas) and I really did not have a chance to price shop. I will chalk this one up to my mistake and hope this review will make others think twice.<//Text><username>R Jennings</username>< user_id>

John Medina, Larry and Jonathon did a great job rerouting the hot and cold water piping to the house.  The crew was polite and presented great communication skills keeping me informed of what they had planned to do with the route taken and why.
Thank you to William and Randy also of the management team!

Called Dutton for service on a faulty water heater. They told me that someone would be out that day.  Waited all day. 3 phone calls from them stating that they would have someone out soon. 3 full days of waiting at home. 15 waste of time phone calls from them. Finally just told them to forget it. Who has time to sit around and wait for someone to show up?  Worst experience ever for a service company.  What a joke. Unless you have a week to wait. Don't bother!<//review>

<Review>The plumbers that came to my house (Shannon and Joel) were seriously amazing.  We have used many different plumber companies in the past and never received service like this before.  We will only use Dutton moving forward.  Not only were they knowledgable and able to fix multiple issues (other plumbers could not), they were also very friendly, took their time to explain things and made sure there were no other issues.  They were life savers and fixed an issue I have had for 3 months that no other plumber could.  Highly recommend them!!!< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< user>

In October of 2020 we had to have some plumbing under the kitchen sink replaced. It worked fine for about 6 months until an entire pipe became detached and flooded under the sink. We called that night and were told that we would be helped the next day. It has been two days and we’ve been rescheduled twice. This is unacceptable. Not only is our kitchen sink inoperable right now, but I’ve had to call out of work for 2 days and now a third just to wait around for nothing to happen. I’m disappointed. The sink pipe replacement shouldn’t have failed so quickly, and I should not have to call out of work just to be told “we’ll get there tomorrow for sure”. We will be using another pluming service after this repair.<//text>

Extend dryer gas pipe 8 feet along outside of a wall. Replace hot and cold water valves. 5 hrs. total. I was quoted $1340.00. No way. So then lowered price to $890.00. No price base to estimate was used. Seamingly arbitrary to see what could be gotten but was just beyond reason. I had to relent to $890 because calling someone else and taking another day off without pay would add up to that. But I had then gotten an over-the-phone quote for $70/hr + parts. Got me!  $30 parts. Over $150/hr. Beware!!!  No show first scheduled day and took day off work. Estimate to replace plumbing in the bathroom remodel - $9000. More than the entire remodel quote from a GC. Same job quoted for $2600 by another county plumbing co. Something wrong here folks.  It was beyond belief. Then I see these reviews of the same rip off.  No ethics. Obviously the BBB should know.  Or they can refund me to reasonable peer competitive rate. Beware!< /review>

Two men came from Dutton. They were very nice and professional. They charged $39 to come out. I dealt with several other plumbing companies, which came for free. There initial quote was more than 2X the other companies. When I would not accept their quote they lowered it but still several hundred dollars above any of the other plumbers. I had the work done by another plumber, but wasted my $39.</review>

Technicians, Richard and Felipe, did a fantastic job finding the cause of a leak and helped to mitigate it before any major damage could occur. They were very professional, kind, and upfront with their service. Dutton has been this home's plumber for more than 10 years and I highly recommend their services.<//text>

<text>So, we bought this awesome new slide in gas range after waiting 6 months because of the COVID delay for appliances - super frustrating. Thought it was going to be easy - old range out, new range in. WRONG. the configuration and recessed space for the gas line on the new range did not align with the old one. So, my new range wouldn't just slide in to the wall but leave a 3"gap behind the range - not acceptable. The solution - having to move a gas line. I am a DIY guy but prefer not to blow myself or my family up when dealing with gas, so had to call the professionals.

Called Dutton at 1:51 pm on a Monday and they had Steve, their gas specialist, out at my house before 4:00 pm. He and his apprentice looked at, accessed and gave me options for my repair/fix. It was ultimately going to take more time than completing it the same day. So, we were Steve's first appointment the following day. He was prompt, polite and professional. His work was clean and thorough. He made sure that everything worked as it should before he left. Totally impressed with Steve and the Dutton Team. Price was fair and appreciated Steve's attention to detail.

I hope that I never have to move a gas line again, but if I do, I'm calling Dutton.</text><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

< review>
My mother had a little leak under her sink. Dutton Plmbg showed up and said the pipe was old, and she needed a $20,000 repipe. She called me, and told her to tell them no. They called back and said they could do it for $13,222. She said no. They called again and said $11,500. She found a handy man, who fixed it for $750.00, and gave her a lifetime grantee even if she sells her place.She didn’t need a repipe. It’s really sad how these big company’s take advantage. How do they live with themselves?  It’s disgusting.< /review>

<Review>Without a doubt the most knowledgeable plumbers out there.  That said, their "pricing" is wonky.  I've been using them for 15 years at two different houses.  It's always a haggle.  The on scene guy gives you a price range, but the manager by phone makes the final adjustments when you start breaking down the per item/service price.  Once you get past all that though, you'd be hard pressed to find a better crew with more resources available to you...one job I had 3 van loads of guys at my house.  So you DO get what you pay for.  It's a love/hate relationship.  I wouldn't want anyone else working on my house....but it's always a bit of a tussle at the beginning.  If you're comfortable asking questions and putting in some work, these guys won't disappoint.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1603310660548, 'text': 'Arno, Thank you so much for review.

We had another plumber (Highsmith & Daughters) out an hour later who relit the pilot for us and cleaned the fire screen . He was done in about 20 min..

Our kitchen sink was clogged and we needed service. The men from Dutton did a good job and all is well again. Felix and his apprentice (so sorry I forgot his name) were both personable and extremely courteous. Both men seemed genuinely interested in giving us the best service possible. Will definitely use Dutton again. Thank you.<//Review>

About a year ago, a valve connector under my kitchen sink broke while I was trying to install something and had to turn the water off to the house. Couldn’t repair it myself...called a few plumbers, Dutton was the fastest to get someone out. He came, looked at everything(he was very nice), quoted me $800. Now, I honestly had no idea what the issue was, but I definitely wanted to get a few more quotes. Second plumbing company came, charged me $175. No thanks Dutton.</Text>

Replumbed system:  Dutton Plumbing offers not just over-the-top professional plumbing services... Their customer service is SECOND TO NONE.  Hooking up with them is not an inexpensive venture, but we knew we were in the best hands.  SO worth it when it comes to our home's plumbing.  No more headaches!!  Can't go wrong with Dutton Plumbing... AND, you can't miss their VERY colorful vans.. woo hoo!  :`></text>

< review>
I've used Dutton twice now and each experience was exemplary of what customer service can and should be.  The issues were very far apart in terms of severity.  The first issue was just inspecting and replacing a kitchen faucet. The second was replacing a water heater.

Both times the technician was prompt, courteous, patient, and explained the issue in great detail.  They were upfront and honest about their prices and offered me a multitude of options to fit my budget and fix the issue the same day.  I did not feel pressured or pushed and I felt they went above and beyond to find solutions that would not require me to shell out astronomical costs.

In particular, I'd like to compliment Cole and Sean who I dealt with on the water heater issue.  Without their help and guidance, I could have had a much larger problem on my hands in the immediate and in the future. They even provided me with a solution that will make the lifespan of my new water heater last much longer.</review>

Work was done satisfactory, but the price was outrageous. Taking advantage of a customer when they have no water is terrible.</Review>

I understood that my appt would between 9-11am on Tuesday.  When their dispatcher called, she said the tech was on another job and would not be available until the afternoon. She would call around 1:00.  When she did call, she said the tech was hung up on the morning job and I would be his first appt the following morning; to expect a call at 8:00am.  No call.  I called at 8:35 and she said the tech was on an emergency related to the previous day's job, and she would get hold of his manager.  I told her to tell the manager that I was very displeased with their service.  The manager called at 9:00 and said someone was not reading his schedule right and the tech would be at my house in 15 minutes.  He was, but he said he had no knowledge of my appt the day before.  I told him we contacted another plumbing company, and they were coming out at 1:00.  So he left without doing the work.  Dutton is expensive and unreliable.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.<//review>

Dutton Plumbing, Inc: We had an emergency service call late in the day, Dutton Plumbing was the only company that was able to confirm they would have someone available and provided me with ETA. Jay our plumber was great, he worked hard to determine the problem. He was unable to complete the repair that night however he rescheduled us as his first appointment the next day showed on time and completed the work. Jay had a great positive attitude was truly knowledgeable.< /Text>

Cole was the service estimator sent to my home.  He was  a very professional and honest  employee, providing a very detailed description of all of the details of my repair request.  I did not commit to  scheduling the minor repair, but  Cole was a very conscientious and inspiring representative of Dutton Plumbing.<//Text>

Could not get any more incompetent than Dutton Plumbing. Don’t use them!  If you do, you’ll be sorry. Called on Thursday, they stood me up for Friday appointment. Then stood me up for Saturday. Had the audacity to ask if they could come on Monday. Wow! The worst of the worst! 0 stars if possible as they couldn’t even earn one star.</Text>

<name>T H< /name><Date>1598988729165< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>I had a simple leaking faucet like most people do so I called Dutton Plumbing in Santa Clarita. When the service tech arrived, I explained the problem and symptoms of the leak and showed him that when I applied light downward pressure to the hot water handle, the drip would stop. This guy, without ever looking under the sink or taking the water handle off to inspect the fixture told me that my entire faucet fixture would have to be rebuilt and replace the shut off valves under the sink or only replace the valves. Without inspecting the valves or the faucet itself, he gave a quote for $515 for replacing the valves and $795 for rebuilding the faucet and replacing the valves, both of which I declined as the cost seemed unusually high.

I emailed the company that manufactured the faucet and provided the exact same description of the problem via email that I gave Dutton Plumbing’s service tech in person. The faucet manufacturer replied back suggesting that I replace the seats and springs under the faucet handle and provided me with the part number. I purchased a two pack of the part for $4.98 and a tube of silicone grease for $4.00 at Home Depot and installed them myself in 10 minutes, resulting in the leak being fixed.

Dutton Plumbing not only misdiagnosed how to fix the leak, they suggested work that did not EVEN need to be done at the cost of nearly $800. They do this stuff for a living, so how could they not EVEN suggest replacing the seats and springs? But instead, he told me that I need to replace my entire faucet fixture and valve handles. I don't like being cheated and that is exactly what this place tried to do to me.

DO NOT let them do any work until you get a second opinion and estimate. They wanted to charge me $800 for work that did not need to be done AT ALL and I ended up fixing the leak myself and it literally cost me LESS THAN the price of a movie ticket. Read the Yelp reviews and you'll see a pattern of them trying to overcharge people.

I spoke to someone at the Dutton after they saw my review and he tried to make up an excuse, saying that they might suggest repairs that are "more comprehensive." There's a big difference between "more comprehensive" and repairs that are not required AT ALL. Crooks!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This time around the customer service was closer to average compared to the last time as more follow up with them needed to be done. Job took a few days; tech was on time first day. Pricey, but we trust it. Not all issues were resolved as a result of repairs like we thought but all and all a good job was done by Jimmy. Both Randy and Jimmy are easy to work with.</Text>

< Review>
Confusion on the time they would show up.  When they tell you sending it over to dispatch at 9:30 doesn’t mean they are coming to your house at 9:30.  Clarify when your on the phone your appt time.  I took the day off waiting and they didn’t come until the next day.  Once they arrived they did a great job kind polite and follow up call right after.  I will use them again.<//Review>

<review>The water heater's pilot would not stay lit. The technician diagnosed the problem and contacted the manufacturer for me, as the water heater was under warranty. The parts arrived 2 days later and the technician installed them the same day.  Very professional and efficient.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Very bad smell coming from upstairs shower and kitchen sink.  They cleaned out sewer lines.  They installed larger clean out system.
Still have smell from sink and shower.. The  2nd tech that came right away knew what where the smell in the kitchen sink was coming from. Replaced a hose and the smell went away. They had to come out a total of 4 times for an issue that could have been fixed on the 1st call had they listened to our request. Spent more time on the phone with the them then it took to fix the problem. Poor communication between techs and dispatchers.  Had to get the managers involved. Not an over all good experience with this company.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

We have used Dutton Plumbing for years and have been happy with them until this last guy!  We got a call about a free annual inspection of our water heater and toilets so we had the guy come out to take a look.  At first, he was nice and greeted me outside.
I showed him the water heater, which was in good shape, or so he said.

His disposition seemed to change once he got into the house.  He seemed to be judging us and our house because we are poor and on a fixed income and can not afford nice things. I saw the guy looking around and making faces at our stuff.  I didn't say anything because I thought it was going to end there and I was used to people judging our stuff, which isn't a big deal.

We had 2 of our 3 dogs in a training crate so they wouldn't jump on the guy and knock him down.  He used the word "cage" when he saw them and we corrected him.  I could tell he was judging us, even after we had already explained it to him we did not want them knocking him down and that we had just put them in the crate once we heard the knock on the door.  They are spoiled and well fed, so I had hoped he would have seen that and let it go at that.  He proceded to make rude comments and noises about our house and asked if something on the back of our sons' toilet was pee.  I said I did not know (because it was the toilet our autistic son uses and he sometimes might miss) and hoped he saw embarrassment and humiliation on my face from his comment.  By this point I thought he was just being rude and hostile.  I guess he didn't see the look on my face because he kept going.
The dogs were still barking from a stranger being in the house.  I just walked away from him, told him I was putting and put all the dogs outside so I could hear what he had to say.  I figured he was having a bad day, so I tried to let it go.  I just wanted this over at this point so he could leave.  He quoted us some astronomical price for fixing a running toilet in our bathroom, I thanked him and thought that was the end, but it wasn't.  I figured he just made up the high price because he didnt want to do the work, which was fine by me because I wanted him gone by that time.  I never made faces or said anything to him because I thought he was taking his bad day out on us, but I really felt humiliated and embarrassed.  I was so ready to let it go and move on with my life

It didnt end there though:  About an hour later, we get a knock on the door from Animal Control about how our dogs were in a "cage" all day long, which is not true, and that the lady had to see them and take a picture of them and write up a report!  We have never been so embarrassed and humiliated in all our lives.
We are NEVER using Dutton Plumbing again!  I AM LIVID THAT HE EMBARRASSED US LIKE THAT!  HE WAS UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!  I was trying to let it go, but now I can't.

Never hire this company!  Never!  I could understand if our dogs were emaciated or mangy looking, which they weren't so I dont know why the guy called Animal Control on us!   Our dogs are well taken care of!  Smh!  I  Now, I wish I had said something and kicked him out for being so rude!  Now, there's a report about our dogs on file with Animal Control!  Thanks Dutton Plumbing! I don't know why they hire plumbers like that because he's not people friendly!  I'm calling Corporate on Monday.  I dont care if it is close to Christmas.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Dutton showed up at the top of my Google search and I decided to give them a try.  They were simply outstanding from the start and were constantly in touch with updates.   Their rep showed up that day and immediately diagnosed the problem, quoted prices for several options and, when the replacement part was from an old outdated fixture, drove 20 miles to find it and came back the next morning to finish the job.  He was courteous, professional and extremely polite.  The price was very competitive.  I would add that the last time I had need of a plumber, I called the so-called "smell good" guys and I felt ripped off.  The $99 drain clog turned into a $1,000 replacement project.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing.< /Text>< Pics>

We had a major pipe break and Dutton showed showed up within a few hours. Jay was wonderful and tried his best to snake it, but our pipes are 60+ years old and it was time for the big fix. They made things as comfortable as they could over the next few days as they replaced our pipe, while doing so they found a gas leak and they just took care of everything, calling the gas company and staying through it all.  All of the people were so friendly and competent. We appreciated it all</Text>

<review>Called Dutton Plumbing the Plumber for leaking pipe under the slab, excellent response time professional appearance needed it fixed or replaced, new pipe. Price quote was fixed too high Dutton Plumbing quoted over four thousand dollars to repair with new by pass pipe. Asked around town found a long time plumber of Simi Valley to do same repair for under one thousand dollars.</review>< gmapID>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>$20K+ estimate job cost to $1,250.
We were referred to Dutton Plumbing by our home warranty to fix our gas leak issue on our property. They came in the next day of our supposed schedule. We paid them $3,110 for them to detect the leak and fix it, after that they weren't able to fix it and told us we need to have a gas line repiping so they gave us an additional quote costing  $20k and may go higher if they need to open the drywalls, we were shocked and asked our friends from construction. We showed them the receipt and the quote and they told us we are getting scammed, they were so heartbroken that people like these exist, we found out stuff like 3pcs shut-off valves we paid for $1,200+ which only costs $25 each etc.. They did their best to find us trustworthy plumbing and referred us to Gordon Taylor Plumbing and long story short, they fixed the whole thing for ONLY $1,250.

Lessons learned... DON'T GET SCAMMED BY THESE SWINDLERS.</Text><userid>101684649605411563488</userid><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><name>Belle Petate<//name></record>

Dutton is one of the best plumbing services I’ve dealt with. In particular, their service technicians Ryan Johnson is excellent.  He’s friendly, professional, and thorough.  Always takes the time to make sure I understand the work performed and answers all my questions.  Best plumber in Ventura county for sure!< /Text>

<review>Had a serious plumbing emergency causing approximately $70,000 in damages.  Dutton Plumbing kept moving our appointment back.  They jacked us around for 36 hours than wanted to schedule us for Thursday when we had called on a Monday and they missed 2 appointments.

JUST CALL ANYONE ELSE and certainly don’t send them to your Mom’s house as their advertising tag line suggests.  Read their reviews on Google and Yelp.  They speak for themselves, that is the one from real customers.<//review><userid>101275569515064805723< /userid>< GmapID>

<Review>They scheduled me same day service, and Jay was prompt and professional. I was sent a photo of him prior to his arrival, so even though I was home alone with my two children, I felt safe opening the door to him. He completed the job in a timely fashion, even with my four year old shadowing him. He was patient and friendly with my son, which I appreciated very much. Our drains were all serviced well.</Review>< date>

Made appointment this morning November the 27th and no one has showed up received Text all day saying they would show up and then they pushed us all the way back to Monday.  Who wants to go a full 5 days with their sink clogged up not being able to cook in their kitchen? Not I.. Moving on to another company! 👎</Review>

Dutton Plumbung doesnt dissapoint in treating the customer with respect and very proffesional. Carlos came on time and tried to get rid of the clog, but to no avail. But he didnt leave without advice and awareness of the pipes we have, and what we should do in the near future. He kept his word, and the sevice was no charge since the clog was not removed. (Yes, we did manage to get it out another way.) ;)</review>

Eric N. was an absolute professional and extremely knowledgeable.  He not only resolved the issue we called for within a couple minutes of arrival, but also assisted and resolved several other minor issues that had been pestering us for quite some time.  Eric is by far the best we’ve seen and would happily go back to this company just for his services.  Really outstanding!</Review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>Friday Dutton Plumbing came to clear residential sanitary sewer line for $73.  Once technician arrived the cost went to $297 to remove toilet & snake & run camera through line. Dutton cleared blockage than called to tell me no guarantee toilet will not backup because existing line is corroded & to replace would cost $10K to $11K. Saturday night 8PM & again @ 2AM animals heard fighting under house. Found screens to crawl space under house not reinstalled. We were not expecting & are disappointed with this service call from Dutton.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpwgY_bNyiayp18YNWkBY32MZUkWT4sn8xgjhQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

The person was very helpful, letting me know I could expect a call from the office first thing. The office called promptly after opening letting me know we were going to get on the schedule for that day and they would call back with updates throughout the morning. I really appreciated that kind of service!
When the crew arrived they were polite, communicated well, and were efficent at their job. They were mindful of keeping the house clean as they came and went.
They provided great service at very reasonable price. I cannot say enough about how impressed and pleased we were with the whole experience. Thanks Dutton!!<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Nobody likes to call the plumber because they know that the plumbing is going to empty in their bank account.

But Dutton takes care of all of that you’ll find it it’s actually not the price it’s the value that you get that makes the money were spending not only are they friendly they’re actually on time… In LA that’s something that literally never happens even if you have a genie in a jar.

COLE showed up exactly on time he was able to diagnose your problem we live in an old house and it takes a lot of work within five minutes he was able to show us everything working through the work that was done and start right away

It didn’t even take him 25 minutes because he had the right tools the right experience it’s probably one of the friendliest plumbers I met seriously don’t worry about price that’s for shoppers value that’s for True customers and that’s what you when you get from Dutton desire  to be a good customer value is worth it.</Review>

He was so friendly and great to work with. When our sink wouldn't drain the first time he went above and beyond to get it unclogged. Couldn't have asked for a better experience and will definitely be asking for Mark M. again for any future plumbing needs.</Review>< pics>

Jake was very professional and did a great job replacing the faucet and explaining the process as well as answering all questions clearly. The company was also really good with following up and scheduling and made it really easy to narrow down a time that worked for me rather than blocking off half a day and me wondering when they'd arrive.</review>

<Text>5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ My first experience with Dutton I was a little nervous getting a plumber in a new city. We just bought our home a few months ago. My sister had used this company and spoke highly of them. I called this morning, they let me know they would be there at a time within an hour window. They texted, emailed and called to confirm with a picture of our Service person. His name is Mark M. He was very professional, clean, and respectful. He listened to my concerns, told me what he thought was going on. Let me know what he was going to do and finished in a timely manner as well. I could not believe how clean he was with the service. He brought a rug, covered his shoes and actually cleaned around my toilet when he was finished. I give the company an A + and Mark gets and A+ too! I am so happy and we now have a new plumber. We can actually ask for the same person again too. The price was great too! Thank you Mark M. And Dutton Plumbing!</Text>< resp>

<Text>Outrageous quotes! Having friendly, punctual plumbers does not excuse price gouging. You should be embarrassed to claim being a company people can trust to send to their mothers!!!!!!
As a large company with so many clients and service calls, you are able to charge LESS than the other local one-man show plumbing services, but instead you instruct your plumbers to take advantage of people.
Such a ridiculous difference, trying to charge me $2400 for the same job another plumber was able to do for $600... Shame on you for taking advantage of a law enforcement family. I’d bet had my husband been home to deal with your plumbers, the quote would have been much less...  SMH.
ZERO STARS and I’ll be sharing this review on any social media and review sites available. What goes around comes around apparently 😉 Cheers!</Text>< gmapID>

This company has just charged my 82 year old mother in law $5100 to replace some leaking pipes and shower mixer in her bathroom. It took just 1 day to complete the work. Included in the price was a charge for over $600 just to test that the work they carried out didn't leak. I am working in London so I spoke to Robert on the phone about the job, he tried to tell me that a length of copper pipe cost $50 when it cost less than $10.

They have quoted $28,000 to replace the rest of the pipework. I have been in the construction industry for over 30 years and have NEVER heard of such prices. They’re not even repairing the drywall that they cut away in the price as the home insurance company are doing that.<//Text>

The technician assigned to my service call (Eric N.) was, in a word “... OUTSTANDING. He  was complete in everything he did, was personable, most professional, and made certain of quality work in every detail of the step-by-step process in replacing 2-faucets. Having had 4-years experience as a plumber’s helper, I fully understood the difficulties involved in this bathroom upgrade. Throughout the work effort, Eric was congenial and thorough. I look forward to again working with him on other upcoming home improvement projects. Dutton has been our preferred plumbing company for years and that TRUSTED choice has been re-enforced by this recent experience.</review>

By doing some work at the house my water pipe started leaking in my garage.
Called Dutton very early in the morning and was greed by a very nice female (sorry missed her name). After explaining  the situation and scheduling  an approximate time for the technician  to arrive they guy appear about right on time.

I knew who I was expecting  because they even send you a picture of the person who will do the job.

Long story short, Eric  was amazing, he not only explained all (I have some skills so I know he was not bluffing) and did the job how I wanted. He even made some recommendations  (not trying to sell because I know that what he was saying I had it in written by the inspector) so good for him in terms of knowledge.

I believe that price is a bit on the high end compared to others, but you cannot put a price on things that you cannot ddo on your ownri and you have no good references
on other people.

My problem was fixed, my wife is happy and I can recommend  Dutton plumbing eyes closed.</Text>

Nice people on the phone, but they kept rescheduling me to the next day. I re-arranged my schedule each day just to be told that they couldn't get to me that day and couldn't guarantee me a time the following day either. They had such good reviews and one of their sayings says, "we can be there in 60 minutes", that is not the case unfortunately.<//review>

Adam was very professional and explained everything in detail what type of work was to be performed. Work was completed in a reasonable time frame and he even cleaned up my shelf under the kitchen sink. Thanks Adam!
The cost of the work was very reasonable and I plan to advise my friends to call Dutton if they have any plumbing problems in the future. Good job!< /Review>

Adam was very professional and pleasant,
and has been to my home before. My drains, showers and toilets are working great,, the pipes needed a good cleaning.  Was a big unexpected expenditure  but was necessary.  I have used Dutton several times, highly professional. Highly recommend.</text>

Juan Carlos said he would take care of us when he first arrived at our house. He did exactly that. I have only dealt with him mostly but everyone involved with our plumbing have been great. They told me what they were going to do and they did it far above my expectations. I will absolutely recommend Dutton Plumbing to everyone. Job well done Carlos. Thank you.</text>

What a great company.  John was professional, friendly and very efficient explaining what repair options we had to fix our water heater.  We usually use our local plumbers which were not available today.  Called Dutton and within hours John was hard at work.  Love their commercials on KHAY.  Will certainly call them in the future</Text>

I was looking to have a shower toilet and sink Installed

First they try to lock you in with a 39 dollar deposit and says it will go to the bill
Nope I didn’t pay it
The guy came over and gave me a price of 16,000

For a brass valve they wanted to charge me 500 dollars

And the same valve was at Home Depot for 10 dollars

Can you believe that !

Please don’t hire these guys unless you like wasting money 💰< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Had a great experience with Randy from Dutton Plumbing today. He arrived right when they said he would, and looked clean and professional. (as they advertise). This is the only plumber I've ever had that took the time to stop at the door and put booties over his shoes, and went above and beyond explaining things and even giving me tips on how I could clean and maintain a leaky shower valve to prevent it from having issues in the future. Normally I dread calling for a plumber, but I would not hesitate to call Dutton again in the future for our plumbing needs.< /text>

We had the good fortune of having our plumbing serviced by David Walker. He did an excellent job, he is very personable and explained all the steps he would be doing to insure us that job would be to our satisfaction. We will definitely ask for David if and when the time comes for servicing of our plumbing.
Thank you David. Dutton don’t let this one go. He’s the best.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>The team of Ken G., Caleb H., and Juan Carlos R. were very helpful, professional, and friendly. We were kept informed on the progress each day while each of the workmen were very polite to my wife and I when we asked questions.
In addition, Caleb Hernandez and Martin Hernandez, who worked on the plumbing of the drain line, the concrete patch,  and the restoration of the brickwork on the driveway planter displayed master workmanship and professionalism.
Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the lead technician,  was a re-assuring presence each time he visited the work site. He made sure we were getting the service we were paying for and were satisfied with the results.

Special thanks to Bernardo, Guillermo, and Jonathan for their work as the installation crew.

I was charged $7,007 for a water heater that you can buy over the internet for under a $1,000. I’m still shocked over the sticker price. They were nice and did a good job installing it, but others would have charged under $3,500 for the same service and unit.< /Text>

<Review>I made an appointment on a Thursday for them to come out on a Saturday when I would be off from work to do a non-urgent repair to a kitchen sink. First they called and said they would be late, then called back at the 11th hour to say that they were too busy and wouldn't be able to be there until Monday or Tuesday the following week.  AAA Plumbing came out in 45 minutes and started work immediately.< /Review>< gmapID>

<Review>The water heater they installed only lasted three years it was leaking all over. And the charge of $1,200 installation fee is outrageous I would never use Dutton ever again. If I didn't know any better I would think they put in used water heater. Watch out for this company, they are definitely Shady.< /Review>< pics>

Leo Barajas was completely professional in all facets. It was a simple drain clearing for a sink,  but you'd never know he was there,  except that it was clear! Thanks Leo, you make the difficult tasks easy. Highly recommended!< /review>

Outstanding work for the full duration of the repipe. All of the men that I’ve met from Dutton Plumbing that have assisted Jake in completing my repipe have the following qualities; great skill sets/ knowledgeable/ professional/ thorough/ responsible/ patient/ good natured and all of those while maintaining a strong work ethic. I also want to give them all a huge thanks for being attentive and working around all of my specific needs.< /text>

<Review>This is a professional business providing quality product and service.  Cole, our installer, was exceptional:  knowledgable, great communicator, thorough, friendly with a wonderful sense of humor.  We highly recommend Dutton Plumbing.  In their case, you DO get what you pay for.  We interviewed several water service businesses and Dutton is the only one offering whole house softening/filtering.  The other services didn't know or didn't want to address this.  NO salt, which can eventually damage pipes.  Preserves appliances and stops mineral buildup.  Water tastes great and our little dogs can drink from the hose--and it's much better fot the plants.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>First I want to thank  the Dutton hiring people for their selection in hiring professional and highly qualified personnel as field service representatives for Dutton Plumbing.. These two gentlemen, Richard M and William G. were at my home on 3/14/2019 to review and fix my plumbing issues. I took them through my home and gave them a review of the issues that I had concerns over and they also looked at my Hot water heater. They found issues with the Hot water Heater which I didn't know about.  They took care of all of my issues and performed their work in a professional manner. A real pleasure in doing business with people like this.<//text><resp>{'time': 1552665828567, 'text': 'Charles, Thank you so much for your 4 star review.

I can’t say enough about how great Dutton Plumbing is and there team especially during this time with the Covid-19. My plumber showed up wearing a mask, gloves and booties without me even having to ask. Lauro & Steve  were very pleasant and knowledgeable. This was a great experience from the beginning to end. Lauro was able to fix my problem quickly with my washer machine valves leaking behind the walls.  5 stars all the way!<//text>

Quick and very clean. Also sought out least expensive way to resolve a problem. I haven’t had many plumbing problems, mostly just hired to change out fixtures. So I have little to compare to as far as costs are concerned. But he was clearly more knowledgeable than a well known plumbing company I used on my house in Pacific Palisades. Price was in high end of my ballpark estimate, but I always seem to underestimate costs. And based on man hours they were far less expensive work I had done for replacing a sewer pipe 2 years ago. Also, all options were explained in advance as well as pricing.  I would recommend Ryan K, the service advisor, without reservation.</Text>

Well yesterday after I left work I get a call from my employees that the men’s toilet is overflowing and leaking water all over the floor.
So we called Dutton Plumbing in the morning and they had there plumber come out at 2:00 pm to fix.
He has to remove the toilet to drain because it wasn’t going down with the regular equipment auger tool. He had to get the big guns out and finally cleared the drain and put everything back to normal.
Thank You Eric Dutton and Thanks to your awesome staff of people at Dutton Plumbing !

Oh yeah it was only 73.00 to clear the drain wow what a deal I owe you guys pizza for sure !<//text>

I needed a plumber on short notice due to a leaky faucet.  I called in the morning and Dutton was great in getting someone out to my home.  Adam A showed up, diagnosed the problem and explained in detail what the issue was, including showing me the issue.  He had a professional demeanor and did good work.  I would call Dutton again.</Text>

<review>Dutton came out in a timely manner and corrected a difficult issue. We needed some follow up help and they were more than willing to come back out and take care of that - same day even! We'll be back and would actually send them to our mom's house like their motto suggests! Thanks guys!< /review>< pictures>

The entire team was friendly and professional from the first call. They kept me informed and got a tech out to me quickly. They included a text with the tech's photo and eta. He arrived on time, was friendly, thorough  and professional and took care of my clog and cleaned up. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs.</review>

It could be that they are in the business for years but that doesn't justify the pricing.</Text>

Firstly, the phone service was exceptional as the office ladies called several time to update me on arrival of the technician.
Secondly, the technician, David W. was great. He detailed what needed to be done, offered advice and finally offered alternatives to the water heater.  He was a professional. Its fantastic to deal with such a customer focused company. I would not hesitate to recommend Dutton Plumbing.
I've already posted this upper part, but now that the work is done, I can't praise this company and David W. enough. David has a superior work ethic, is easy to talk to, very nice and kept me up to date on the progress. He kept the area clean and was nice enough to wait for me to do some work, so that he could continue, which is a rarity these days. If I could give the company 6 stars, I would.< /review>

I am very impressed with the professionalism and quality of work in my  recent experience with Dutton Plumbing. I had a broken water pipe inside the wall between the hall bath and one of the back bedrooms. I called and had a plumber out to my location within hours.  They sent a photo of the workman, a clean cut, respectful young man who wore booties over his shoes inside the house, covered the rug and cleaned up ... complete with an industrial vacuum when he was finished. I was provided with a 4 page document that included a detailed account of the work.  I couldn't be more satisfied.< /review>

<text>Brandon put in a new water heater for us. Throughout the entire process he was pleasant, informative and professional. He explained options, prices and answered all questions we put to him. He completed a relatively lengthy task in one afternoon.  Our home is on a hill and the water heater space is tucked into a small room in the middle of a rambling home layout. His work was flawless. He kept the work area clean and picked up/swept the area after he was done. Easily a 5 star rating. Great job.< /text>< user_name>

<Review>Randy was by far the most professional, honest and knowledgeable technician that I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. He came by on a Sunday diagnosed the problem and got to work. He resolved the problem, efficiently and in a timely manner. He didn't try and sell anything that wasn't needed, which seems to be something you run into with plumbers.  Thanks again for your help, keep up the good work.<//Review>< Pictures>

Bernardo was a member of the team from Dutton Plumbing who installed a sleeve around our plumbing line from our home to the city sewer connection.  Bernardo worked consistently hard and diligently on a hot day.  He was polite, took pride in doing a good job and completed  job with his crew in one day.  He left our front yard exactly as he found it.  he obviously had pride in his work.  We were pleased at the end of the day and impressed with the professionalism.</Text>

Great communication with Dutton Plumbing.  I had a tech here in about an hour. The ladies at the office kept me informed on scheduling. Their tech Jaiyro was right on time, did a professional job and even educated me on some plumbing concerns. There pricing is upfront and I did not get the up sell treatment.
I have in the past used  another plumbing company here in Simi . I had a very bad experience with them and will now use only Dutton.
I would definitely recommend Dutton to anyone.</review>

< Review>
Rick came out to do a home inspection. He was very professional, knowledgeable and very thorough. He not only listed each item that
required attention but also showed us its location. He was careful to
make sure he didn't left any messes. I especially liked that he prioritized
needed repairs and gave us options on prices to help us with budgeting for the repairs.< /Review>

They call when they say they are going to call,  they answer all of your questions and concerns,  the employees are always in proper uniform and have ID readily available. I wish more businesses were as accommodating and caring and thorough and professional as Dutton. My technician in particular was AMAZING. His name was Thomas and although young he was very knowledgeable,  quick and just a pleasure.  I would reccomend their service to anyone.  I truly trust Dutton Plumbing.< /review>< pictures>

Contacted Dutton Plumbing today to inquire about Tank less Water Heaters. I certainly got lucky when this Marvelously Sweet person named KAYLA answered the phone asked me if I would like a technician to come out TODAY for estimation and explanation, of course I did.

Well let me say straightaway that I was floored by RANDY ARNOLD, his pleasantly enthusiastic demeanor was well just Awesome. Not at all the crusty plumber who was wishing the day was over and had to be at my house. no not at all, RANDY ARNOLD spent an extensive period of time explaining the technology behind the unit as well as the actual labor and materials that would be required (may I add using terms that made me feel comfortable about the procedure). RANDY ARNOLD asked me often if I was understanding it and if I was still feeling comfortable about making the change. Wow if only the guy at the dealership was that enthusiastically compassionate about selling me a car.

RANDY ARNOLD also mentioned the Family Service Plan for a Lifetime which I jumped all over with great joy. He completely described ALL of the facets and services that accompany the plan. Sold, Sold, Sold.
What a great idea a preventive maintenance plan for my home plumbing needs.

All in All, Yes we have decided to purchase the unit from Dutton Plumbing as well as the Family Service Plan. We are looking at installation as soon as next week, of course RANDY ARNOLD will be our technician with Dutton for as long as he is associated and look forward to his Smiling Face in our Place.

Thank You very much for Your time today Randy, it was a real pleasure meeting you.

Thank You very much Dutton for having RANDY ARNOLD on your staff and allowing us to benefit from his expertise and just plain niceness.

<Review>Adam Alvarez provided exceptional service! He is friendly, easy to talk to, very knowledgeable and is concerned about the customer’s problem along with a determination to fix whatever is wrong. Adam worked hard and kept in touch the whole time. He conducted himself in a professional manner and answered all my questions by explaining what I wanted to know. Furthermore, I feel that Adam is a very good PR person for Dutton Plumbing and definitely an asset to the company.

Other Dutton field technicians who helped do the repiping job: Miguel V., Ricardo and Edgar. Miguel, who was managing the job itself, kept me well informed about their progress and did a great job. I didn’t have occasion to get to know Ricardo or Edgar very well, but they worked very hard and displayed integrity in what they were doing. I really appreciated their efforts because the quick results speak for themselves.

Overall, I am pleased with the rapidity of the job and the results. I now have peace of mind that I won’t continue to be plagued with recurring drain blockages as I have in the past. I would recommend Dutton Plumbing without reservation to anyone needing a reliable high quality company to get their plumbing or rooter needs taken care of. Thanks for a job well done Dutton!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Dutton Plumbing made for a pleasant and efficient solution to my household problem. My call was answered by a charming person whose name I’d do injustice to if I tried to spell it. Joe, a nice, professional dispatcher called promptly with the name of a technician who would arrive at my home within an hour. The technician, Ryan, arrived on time and made short work of my problem.<//Review>< Name>

I just want to take this opportunity to thank the Dutton Plumbing gentlemen JAMES and WILLIAM who were out to my home to replace the main house water shut valve.  I am disabled and in an electric wheelchair.  They were prompt, helpful, accomodating and so very friendly.  As with all plumbers the price was high but they showed me several options to facilitate payment.  I strongly recommend Dutton Plumbing as your service provider for any and all your plumbing needs.</review>

Cole was very thorough in his review of my problem and searching through four other problems and suddenly discovered the source of a leak which was very troublesome. Following his excellent discovery we solve a major source of expense that appeared on my water bill for which I’m very appreciative. We solve the problem this I’ve been plagued with For a long time.  He was very professional in his approach and thoroughly explained all the options that were available to me. As a representative of dirt and plumbing I would highly recommend him to anyone who has plumbing problems</Text>

<Review>Really quick service!  Almost immediately I had a text update, with a picture and name of my service provider to be expected (which is great for those that are unsure of who to expect coming into your home).  When he arriveded he immediately put on booties to keep my floor clean (which is bonus points, because I just mopped), he listened to my issues with the garbage disposal and sink, gave me advice on how to keep this from happening again (as well as what to expect), and fixed it in less than 5 minutes!

Diego did a great job with our plumbing service. He explained thoroughly what the problem was and listened to our concerns. He went above and beyond to deliver great work and customer service. He also gave us a great deal on all the work that had to be done. Diego and Ryan were incredibly nice and polite and really delivered a great customer experience. Because of that experience with Diego and Ryan we will definitely use Dutton plumbing again.</text>

Dutton Plumbing has superior craftsmen for all Your needs. Noe A. & his brother came to do all the stucco finish work. He is excellent at what he does. Noe is friendly, happy & always laughing as he works along side his brother. We are very pleased with the work they did for us & they went beyond the work that was required.</review>

Outstanding service, Leo the technician came and fixed our clogged that I could not fix myself. He gave me some tips to maintain the pipe clean, while he was working on my kitchen sink issue. Honestly, this is one of the best service I have had in awhile.
KEEP UP THE BEST SERVICE!!!
Will definitely call this company again if any issue arises.

Mark was awesome. Very professional and friendly. They put on shoe covers to ensure the floor was kept clean and before snaking out the kitchen drain prepped to ensure nothing got dirty during the process. Everything went pretty quick and when he was done told me if the clog comes back in 90 days he would come fix it for free. Would definitely recommend.< /text>

James was prompt, helpful and well-informed.  He found a leak in my roof caused by a neighbor and gave me a $50 discount on the inspection since the leak wasn't my fault.  I appreciated that small concession greatly as I am on a tight budget and was looking at a $1000 bill if the leak was as catastrophic as it might have been.< /review>

Our drains had backed up and Jairyo came from Dutton, diagnosed the problem - a clogged washing machine line - fixed it, tested it, double-checked it, and left the laundry room cleaner than it was before he came to do the job.  He is also unfailingly cheerful and polite at all times.  Five stars.<//review>

<Review>We had exemplary experience with Adam Alvarez the service professional from Dutton Plumbing.  He was very knowledgeable about his trade and answered all our questions to our satisfaction.  Adam took care of the drainage problem from the problematic second floor and left the area clean and tidy.  We highly recommend Adam take care of any plumbing needs you may have.  We sure will call Dutton again if needed.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Amazing. Will use again if needed. I used the CHAT service on their webpage. It was a call center, but, I shortly received a call from Tania at the company. She explained it was a Sunday, and had one driver handling emergencies. She let me know that I would be in the queue and she would keep me updated. First appointment was 1100 am. I received a call postponing it to 200 pm. Shortly after, they called back and said Randy was on his way. He arrived a 11:15, well within when he was expected.

Randy was personal and professional. He was clean and polite. We were even able to make small talk without distracting his work. Not only was the visit quick, but no shady upset tactics. I paid $73,00 as advertised. He had to cut tree roots out of a line outside of the house with one of his tools. Not only did I get great service, I received great value.

With any other company, I would have paid 2-3 times what he charged.< /Text>< Pictures>

Best service I've EVER had in a plumber.  Been a homeowner for 45 years, never before encountered such integrity in a contractor. Called before they came, showed up when promised, cleaned up after, polite, efficient, very competent, no hard sell. Just absolutely a great experience. Marc was my technician, I spoke to Kayla in the office...  really really nice folks.  Recommended, without reservation.</review>

I am a caregiver for a client who lives in a senior community. My client called me in distress because both toilets and shower in his condo had backed up. I arrived in less than half an hour and Ray jr. G arrived 5 minutes after me. He was friendly, knowledgeable, handsome and worked fast! I thought, Wow! This guy gets handsomer and handsomer as he finishes the job in under 20 minutes. He did his thing and i was able to get in and clean up so my client and his wife could safely use the bathroom with no slip, trip or falls. This guy was great. When I asked him for his card so I could recommend this company to my friends, clients or whomever may need plumbing services, he asked that I leave him a review. I said I absolutely would. Once again... I thought this guy, this outfit, was fabulous.</Review>

David came out to repair our water heater. He arrived less than 2 hours after we called. He explained the process and costs. While it turned out to be the more expensive problem of the two he described, I wasn't surprised by the increased cost. He did the work quickly and within about 45 minutes our water heater was working. He was professional and very pleasant.<//text>

Dutton staff are beyond professional - they are courteous and attentive, kind and polite. They treat you and your home with respect, using abundant covers to avoid tracking dirt and vacuums to minimize dust.  You get text  and images of the workers to ID who's coming to your house. I can't speak to value, because I didn't bother getting bids from other plumbers.  I will say that it's common to over-promise, and under-deliver in home repair (  workers "discover unexpected issues" that drive up costs and prolong repairs).  James advised us the work might take 3-10 days, but the Dutton crew did the work in 2 with no additional charges or up-sells. They addressed all our concerns regarding disturbing cabinetry and explained options and financing clearly.   If you got old pipes, call these guys.< /text>

<Text>We had a leak in the bathroom that caused wet spots under the rug a few feet away;  we also were interested in a water filtration system and a new waterless heater.  All of this took 5 days to complete and the techs never stopped working.  STEPHEN S. was our main tech;  we cannot say enough positive things about him.  He is very knowledgeable, professional, friendly and respectful of other's property.  I have never seen anyone work as steadily and quickly as STEPHEN S.;  we had Larry, Tony, Cole and others here during the week, however, STEPHEN S., was the one in charge and he is excellent at what he does!  Each day, everything was left spotless.  His patience and direction with other techs is a great asset, also.  Each Tech that was here deserve praise, as they all knew what the were doing.  The Customer Service personnel are the best and we highly recommend STEPHEN S. and Dutton Plumbing.  Thanks, STEPHEN S.!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Juan R. And Cole were prompt, friendly, and courteous. Juan explained everything thoroughly and gave me options before he began. They came in last-minute and saved me from a weekend without a kitchen, even if that meant not having dinner until almost bedtime. I’d recommend them in a heartbeat, and I swear if Juan needed a kidney, I’d seriously consider being a donor.<//review>

Took 3 separate visits over 4 days to fix our water heater. Forget trying to call them for "emergency service"--i.e. after regular business hours. They'll just send a notice to whoever's in the filed and hope for the best, without giving you any updates. Take your business elsewhere.</text>

Mark came out and cleared out our drain in the front yard and took the call at the end of the day. I was so grateful to get this resolved quickly since the plumbing company I usually call was booked up for the evening and would not be able to help till tomorrow. He greeted me with a smile and a handshake and in less than 30 minutes he had it cleared. In the meantime I think we got to know each other pretty well in that his great personality kept a conversation going through the process and I know I have found myself a new plumbing company! Great personality, great attitude and cost almost 25% less than my former plumbing company.</text>

<Review>Greg B is by far the BEST plumber I have ever worked with. Due to my plumbing problem my neighbor shut off all my water on a Friday night. I called Dutton on Saturday as I had heard they were the best company.
Greg arrived around 5 and didn’t leave til after 9.
Unfortunately my problem was not easily fixable through no fault of Gregs. HOWEVER, Greg did a temporary fix so I could have my water on for the rest of the weekend.  Greg came back on Monday and finished the job!!! I cannot recommend Greg enough. He is very kind and considerate! As important he is very experienced and obviously he knows exactly what he is doing. If I have plumbing problems in the future I want Greg to do the work!!<//Review></record>

Danny D was very prompt, respectful and knew what he was doing. He cleared the drains, fixed the leak, put in a new cap and even checked my water pressure - looking for a leak. I appreciate the ease of calling, making the appointment and getting the job done. I would recommend Dutton over many other plumbers I have used in the past.< /Review>

We have used Dutton Plumbing for several years at Santa Paula Animal Rescue Center and every time we have needed their assistance, they've been there, quickly and their service has always been outstanding!
Due to our needs, they have to visit us often and one of the plumbers even adopted a dog from us, who gets to go to work with him every day!  We are so grateful to have Dutton Plumbing as our service provider, which also feels like part of our SPARC family!  Highly recommend their professionalism and quality of service!< /Text>

<Review>Robert was professional, curious and knew exactly what he was doing! He cleared our kitchen sink drain in a timely manner and explained everything to us. Highly recommend his service to anyone looking for a GREAT plumber! Also, Dutton Plumbing was offering a free Mothers Day service call and we were luckily one of the 3 callers! I want to thank Dutton Plumbing for your wonderful Mothers Day gift! 🌸 Thank you, The Martin's</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>Was told I would be in the first round of service for the day, ended up being the last call of the night. I had to call at least three times and demand to speak to a manager before getting a plumber scheduled.

The plumber barely spent any time looking for my sewer clean out. When it was not plainly visible, he then charged me $39 to come out and recommend I schedule a minimum $400 service with someone else. Called management afterward and was told I should not have been charged and would get my money refunded.

To say I am very upset is an understatement. I will not be using them again because of their inattentive plumbers and unresponsive call center. The only silver lining was that the supervisors and managers were helpful in finally getting a plumber out and for refunding my money.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I was really impressed with the company. We needed a plumber quickly and I called Dutton.  Not only did they have someone come out within one hour, but they emailed me information on the technician and sent an email confirmation and then a phone call to confirm.

Contacted Dutton on a Sunday for to look at an emergency water leak in the master bathroom. Diego was a pleasure to work with. He provided multiple options on how to proceed and was very collaborative in resolving the problem in the quickest fashion while his skills allowed the repair to be completed without having to remove any of new tile work which would have added significant cost and time to the repair project. Great work and would recall Dutton without hesitation.< /Review>

I had a gas leak in the valve that turns on the gas to my fireplace.  I was very impressed with the speed in which Dan confirmed the leak and fixed it.  Dan and Randy were excellent.  They were polite and respectful. If asked,  I would recommend Dutton Plumbing.</text>

<review>Ric was awesome! He was very courteous and understanding of my situation having dealt with another "plumber" who left my kitchen plumbing in a shambles. He answered all my questions, thoroughly explained everything that needed to be done and completed the work efficiently. I chose Dutton  because I had dealt with them on one other occasion years ago. Needless to say, Dutton made a great impression back then and evidently, nothing has changed! It's never pleasant when plumbing issues arise but Dutton definitely makes it easy. From the customer service reps who took my calls and followed up with me to Ric, the knowledgeable and competent tech who got the job done. These are the people to call. Thanks again, Dutton!😊</review>< pics>

Wow  I am totally impressed with how quick their response was. Great communication received a phone call to verify I was still needing a plumber, then a call to let me know what time Ken Jr  was going to be at my house.  Ken Jr was very friendly, professional and right time, within minutes he had my sink drain flowing again!  He gave me some great advice for preventing backups for next time & also ideas of what needs to be replaced in a few years to help maintain. Thank you Dutton Plumbing for the great service provided just like what the radio says.< /text>

< Review>
Top notch service! The Dutton Plumbing crew is amazing!  We recently had a sewer connection problem in our front yard due to a poor installation made before we bought the home.  The problem came up with less than three days before we had an event at our home, expecting over 100 guests.  The Dutton crew came out, identified the problem, and began working on it within an hour.  They had to do a lot of digging (about 5 feet down!) to get to the problem.  My dad watched every step of the process from beginning to end.  They had to remove the offending connection, and then lined the existing old pipe with an epoxy liner, a major operation.  The three plumbers who worked on the job, Mark M, Juan Pablo, and Ricardo S were extremely proficient, answered every question my dad had, and even serviced other areas of the house plumbing so everything would be fully operational.  We cannot highly enough recommend Dutton Plumbing!<//Review>

We had roots blocking the outside drains around our pool decking. Adam let us know his ETA which was very helpful. He was professional, courteous, knowledgeable and thorough in his explanation of the problem and the various solutions. He was up front on cost. He spent quite a lot of time snaking the multiple drains around the pool, pulling out the roots and when was finally done, I could see how well water now flows.  He was impeccable in his after job clean up. I would highly recommend Dutton Plumbing and would recommend asking for Adam who has been doing this for 31 yrs. If the whole team is as professional as Adam, this is a very good company.</text>

I have had the privilege of calling them out to my home 2 times now and there service is unbelievable!!!  I had a small plumbing company that I had used for several years until I got tired of them ripping me off and them not standing behind their work. My last experience was with Dutton’s service pro Marc R  who came and located a problem that was a sprinkler pipe issue and he did not even charge me after spending a lot of time finding the issue. Marc did inform me and quoted me a price that my house does not have a pressure regulator. Installing one will help to not create other issues with other things like toilets, facets etc in the future. I am making an appointment for that today.
Marc R was so professional and kind and had such a “CAN DO” attitude. It was very refreshing and Dutton plumbing should be very proud to have him on their staff.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Seldom do I find a company that provides the quality service Dutton Plumbing incorporates into every aspect of their business.  From  appointment setting, sending an email confirmation which includes the appointment date with the name and picture of the technician.
To the most important component, an excellent technician, Steven Vidaca.  He did not rush into the work but talked with me for a few minutes as we checked the other plumbing locations in my home and yard.  He handled the issues I had called about but found an area underneath my sink that had serious corrosion and would soon be causing me real problems.

This company is fantastic, true professionals.  Our home is 57-58 years old and the plumbing was crumbling.  Dutton gave us an estimate, helped us get financing (even through our own bank), and worked like energizer bunnies to get the job done rapidly.  Great crews, and great guys!  They are the BEST!</Text>

Kevin from Dutton really knocked it out of the park. He not only addressed the major issue that inspired us to call for service, but he identified other serious issues that would create problems for us down the road. Kevin and his crew were professional, courteous and kept our house clean, despite doing a lot of trenching in our front yard. They resolved our problems effectively and quickly. I highly recommend Dutton for your plumbing needs, and if you're in Simi Valley, ask for Kevin!< /Review>

<user>112336524831572196323</user><review>Dutton seems to have the best prices around. $73 (as of this review date) for any simple drain clean (like the main four-inch line running from my house to the street - 70 feet). They are very well organized in that they keep you updated as to when the technician is coming and don't give you unrealistic expectations. The equipment that they used for my latest main line clog is top notch and they don't make a mess. Also, they have great communication skills.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I got a quote over the phone for $199 from Michael. When the plumber got here he gave me a quote of $549. This was to find a leak in a pipe that was in the dirt in about a 5' x 10' area. They were asking $549 to dig a hole to find a leaking pipe! Unbelievable! The quote I was given over the phone was for the same thing. The plumber said he would call the office. I watched him and he did not talk to anyone else. He came back to me and said $249. I told him to leave my property. These guys are scam artists so BEWARE!!!<//text>< Pictures>

Jimmy was great.  He made every attempt to resolve the concern without giving up.  the tech was courteous, punctual and professional.

however, the only drawback were the 8 phone calls received from the office and call center.  redundant info such as confirming the address 6 times. the spelling of my name and will someone be there.

when i am at work, it was hard to stop work, drop my tool belt, reach in my pocket, take off my gloves to answer just to confirm information conveyed in the beginning.

this will not prevent me from using their services again, but hope this review will prompt them to review why they would overly ensure, with levels of certainty and continuous confirmations that the info they are requesting is as true the last time as it was the first time and every moment in between. (reading this review and typing it has the same effect--boring and monotonous).</Text>< user>

Heard good things about these guys from a friend, so I called. My call was answered by someone who spoke english, and was able to confirm a time to call me back to set an exact appointment time (same day). I didn't get a call back initially, so I called and rescheduled for the following day as I could not wait at home any longer. After that, smooth sailing. The dispatcher called me that next morning confirming a time, and then the repair man called me when he got there. He was cool enough to wait a few minutes for my fiance to get there. It took him 25 minutes to fix the clog and he was on his way. The price remained consistent, no surprises. This would have been 5 stars if I had initially gotten a call back like i was promised. However that being said, I would absolutely use these guys again.< /review></record>

The tech and his crew were friendly and extremely neat and clean when doing the job.  Always able to answer any questions we had.  Stayed long and late but finished in in a very quick time frame. Re-plumbed the entire property in two days.  My family and i are very pleased and would recommend them to everyone.  Very professional group of guys right down to the drywall work to close things up.
Hands down, excellent work.
The drywall guy that they employ, DREW, does immaculate work, and he is very fast also.  Many years of experience showed in his quality of workmanship<//text>

First , I would like to thank a lot for the technician from Dutton Plumbing come to my house to estimate the job i want to do is replace Water pressure regulator . I did refuse to do it because  for me I think the estimate like all the way going to the Mars not the Moon .

Thanks for not charge me for fee for the time the technician travel to my house that i do not agree  the estimate.
And thanks for the professional Customer Service from  Dutton Plumbing to contact me before and on the day of the appointment , and the technician coming on time and very professional doing whatever he has to do with his job for the company.
( His Name : Steven Snyder )

Second ,  I would say Dutton Plumbing want to charge me around $600.00 to $750.00 ( six hundred dollars to seven hundred fifty dollars) from the initial estimate from the technician for the job to do is replace the Water Pressure Regulator  ( included Part and Labor ) .

Wow,wow .... my eye likes to see July 4 fireworks and winning lottery  . is it true like the technician told me ?

After the phone call back to the office from the technician to get the price from the boss is : ... $ 600.00 ( six hundred dollars )
I think that price ...... too much ... unbelieveable .

( Home Depot >> part cost for 3/4 inches around $90.00 to $150.00 )

Even the  Part is $200.00 , how can the labor cost  $400.00 for the job to do less than 1 hour . ( I think for the technician to do is less than 30 minutes )

Finally , I ask for $250.00 to $300.00 to do the job but Dutton Plumbing is not agree .

Ok , I do it myself , I went to Home Depot buy the Part included tax around $100.00 and went home to replace  less than 30 minutes. It's working good now.

Again ,  I think Dutton Plumbing , very professinal company with good review from the customer

..........please charge for the job done with a reasonable price .

I'm not sure I want to call back Dutton Plumbing for any Plumbing problem need to fix .

That my thought .

Sincerely,

Andrew<//Review>

<Text>Had a stopped up sink, with some shoddy plumbing done by a bad handyman before.  Felix came late on a Friday in some pretty awful traffic and was completely nice - I'd have been pretty cranky.  He not only fixed the clog, but went above and beyond to make sure my family was safe.  I truly appreciate his help, and would hire him any day of the week.</Text></record>

< Review>
Brandon and Paul came out to provide a second opinion for us today. We had been quoted a suspiciously low price for a sewer reroute by another company, and we wanted to see what other expenses we might expect. The guys did a very thorough inspection of our pipes using roof vents and clean outs and a high quality camera. From there, they determined that we did not have an immediate need for a reroute (we had been told that there was sewage leaking under the house and we should move on the reroute the same day). They were responsive to our initial call, on time, friendly, clear communicators, straightforward about their pricing, and--most importantly--were honest to the point of not advising a huge job right away. They will keep our business because of it.</Review>

I had such a good experience with Dutton plumbing.  The issue I was having proved to be challenging, but the tech providing service, Jimmy, was helpful, informative and willing to try multiple alternative solutions to help minimize the disruption in my house and to my day.

He explained everything thoroughly, was kind to my dogs, respectful of my home and fixed the problem very efficiently.  I'd recommend him and Dutton without hesitation.  We've done a great deal of remodeling, in four different houses so I've had lots of service technicians in our home.  My experience with Dutton stood out as being entirely positive.  It takes a good plumber to turn a plumbing emergency into a good experience and that's exactly what Jimmy from Dutton did.< /review>

When my kitchen sink clogged, I tried everything to fix it myself... without any success. I dreaded calling a plumber because of a few poor experiences in the past, but I couldn't avoid it. I looked Dutton Plumbing up online because I had just heard one of their radio commercials. From the time I got to their website, everything about my experience with them was absolutely great! There's a lot of helpful information there, the phone number is easy to find, and one of the nicest features is their chat service where a real, live person is waiting to help you! Within a few minutes, I received a call from a friendly, efficient representative who answered my questions, took my information, and advised me that a technician would be arriving shortly. Next I received a text message and email to advise me of the approximate time of arrival, a picture and a brief bio of the tech who would doing the work for me... WOW! Jimmy arrived on time, he was very professional, friendly, polite, he explained everything to me, fixed the problem, and cleaned up as if he had never been here. After he left, I received a follow-up call from Dutton Plumbing to see how the service was! I'm totally blown away! These people really take good care of their customers... a rarity. I will definitely call them again if a problem arises. And if you ever need a plumber for anything, I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing. I think you'll be just as amazed and I am with the quality of their service!</Text>

I had a plumbing problem in my shower 🚿 I heard the ad over the radio and had to think what’s the catch to the $73 drain cleaning or it’s free, what’s this going to set me back after they do the work ? To my surprise that’s all it was $73 and it was done and Edger that came was the same one the operator said who it was going to be and even on time 🤗 but what I thought was even more so that he was very nice and explained everything and he even has slip covers for his shoes I’ve never had any kind of plumbing experience like this , my landlord always sent these smelly sloppy Mickey Mouse workers ...from now on I will only be going to Dutton plumbing they went above and beyond thank you again Edger for such a great service!! And will definitely be telling my landlord and friends 🤗<//Text>

I want to give a massive shout-out to Dutton Plumbing and particular the service pro Jay.  Jay was extremely courteous and professional, in addition to efficiently fixing a pernicious clogging problem deep in the plumbing of several upstairs bathroom sinks.  Price was very reasonable and service was exceptional.  A definite five-star experience.</Review>

<username>Kelly Dauer<//username><Pics>None</Pics><review>I was very nervous about calling a plumber due to the unknown cost and character of the company. I am new to the area so I didn't know who to trust. After looking at multiple reviews, I called Dutton; there wasn't a single review I saw that was less than 4.5 stars. Scheduling an appointment was simple, their staff is helpful and their customer service exceptional. I called them at 1AM on a Saturday and they got right back to me. While the repair was more than we had planned (not from a quote received by Dutton, just estimating based on internet searches), the service provided and Leo our technician, along with the warranty can't be beat. I plan to have them come out and do a comprehensive inspection of my home.  I believe they are trustworthy and that's very important to me.</review><userid>111539847220067764256< /userid>< Rating>

This  company is great on cleaning out your lines, but I would not recommend them for anything else...higher than a cat's back on prices and strong armed us into getting us to buy this tankless water heater.  Too many things went wrong and still waiting for our chimney to get fixed....yes part of it was knocked down.   Mother, in the radio ad, wouldn't  be pleased.<//Review>

<review>I called Dutton plumbing today for a shower drain issue and the whole process to schedule and have a technician come to my house was easy and pleasant. When Adam my service pro arrived he was super nice, explained to me that I didn’t really have a drain clog issue at all, and the water was normal to be in the catch. He was super nice and professional didn’t make me feel foolish at all for not knowing that. I had a drain cleaning done anyway since I don’t think it had ever been done on the house. Adam was wonderful to work with and knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely use Dutton plumbing again and highly recommend Adam.< /review>< pictures>

Luis was awesome. The valve on the main water line to the house was busted and needed to be repaired. The entire fixture was really old and did not have a pressure regulator between the street and the house, so I was not surprised when Luis recommended that the entire fixture be rebuilt. He quoted us a number of options from the 'band-aid' fix to the long term fix. Once we decided which one to go with Luis completed the job quickly and we are very happy with the results. There may be other lower priced plumbers out there however given the great customer service and quick response I would definitely recommend Dutton.< /review>

The appointment process is strange—they don’t give you an arrival time, they give you a time they’ll call and let you know whether or not a tech can be there that day—but the tech, Dan, was friendly, knowledgeable, and the price was fair. Will deal with again, hopefully with a better/revised “appointment” process next time.</Text>

<review>I chose Dutton Plumbing for the second time.  The first was for two plugged shower drains -- excellent service then. Was introduced to a once per month powder to keep drains clear.  It's been a year and no problems with showers.

Saturday, December 12, 2015, my second experience with a plumbing issue.  Again, I was met with a courteous individual named Bryan Castaneda. He fixed the problem with a bathroom sink slow drain with complete skill; showed me the cause and how to avoid a future problem.

I'm completely satisfied with the performance and skill of the technicians and have recommended Dutton to family and friends if they have a plumbing problem. I also would like to note that they wear booties when entering the home and the cleanliness with which they perform the repair/service.

Thank you Dutton Plumbing.  You have a customer for life!</review>< pictures>

< review>
Dutton Plumbing is the best! I'm so sick of tired of plumbers and other experts like electricians making appointments with me and either being late or just not showing up at all. Dutton kept me in the loop at all times, and once my appointment time came, Richard and Michael arrived to unplug my garbage disposal and kitchen pipes. The worked to get it unplugged, and did it professionally and competently. They strive to have 5-star reviews, and based on my experience tonight, they are certainly getting one. Thanks so much!< /review>

He replaced two bathroom sink faucets with new ones, and he completely re-did an outside copper water line  that supplies a new irrigation sprinkler system and includes a new hose spigot as well.

First and foremost, from my initial call to the arrival of the service team, everyone involved, Tania B., Dan D., and Leo B. took the time to answer ALL of my, how should I say it, less than intelligent questions and never flinched. The team at Dutton Plumbing kept me informed by e mail and phone about the arrival time and the names of the service providers who would be performing my needed repairs. Dan D. and Leo B. are just pros, plain and simple. They arrived on time, made the repairs and left nothing behind. Truly an exceptional experience!!! The team at Dutton Plumbing are professional, efficient and expert. Well Done Dutton!!!< /Review>< user_name>

<Review>If your in the need of having your plumbing repaired DO NOT use Dutton Plumbing. After waiting 27 hours, yes 27 hours, for a technician to come repair our hot water heater they phoned to let us know they could not make it out that day. Horrific way to run a business. It they are that laxed in their scheduling imagine the proficiency of their technicians.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Used Dutton several times now, always a positive experience.  Telephone people are courteous to the max.  Technicians are always on time, friendly, clean, and ready to work.  They always explain step by step what they need to do, why, and what options I have.  Most recent experience was with Sean, but other techs have been equally excellent.  I don't plan on returning to my previous plumbing company.</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1468436156003, 'text': 'Thanks, Joel! It was our pleasure serving you.

<review>I'm very happy I called this company. I had went on Dutton Plumbing website and was so surprise how the company posted each
workers one by one about themselves. The "5" star rating I wish I could have giving a "10" star rating but it only goes "5" star rating,  the company had sent me Mr Ernie Rodriguez , this gentleman did a "PROFESSIONAL" job
going all through our home checking all the pips while explaning to me what he is looking for Mr Ernie Rodriguez took his time and did not do a rush  job in which I really like.  I'm sooooooo very happy Mr Ernie Rodriguez came to our home he did a GREAT job repaiing our toilet and flushing out our tankless water heater .<//review><Name>rita mail<//Name>< GmapID>

The news was terrible but the end results were great.  After Jay N. and Nicholas G. spent more then five hours trying to snake open the blocked drain, via the camera, a broken and impacted old metal sewer pipe was detected, of all places under the garage floor. In less than three days Jay N. and Juan P. and crew replaced roughly 30 feet of underground pipe,  mostly under the concrete, added two "clean outs" replace the "T", this was all done by only opening up a three by three foot square area in our garage floor.   Jay N. and Juan P. were super; courteous, polite and kept us informed through out the process, when completed the work area was cleaned, we didn't have to touch it.  I would highly recommend these guys especially with complex issues as ours due to their knowledge, work ethics and technology.< /text>

The plumbing technicians Juan R and James C did an excellent job of evaluating my service needs. They ultimately repaired a toilet and removed and installed a new garbage disposal. They were very clean, and not pushy. I was offered many choices for consideration. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is Dutton is very expensive in my opinion. However, they arrived promptly in the morning and got the job done!< /review>

This review is for Diego Magaña from Dutton Plumbing. Diego came to fix a variety of issues at my house. He was very knowledgeable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. I had been looking for a specific replacement shower head for several years and had asked two previous plumbers who were unable to find what I wanted. Diego knew exactly what I needed and easily found the perfect one! I highly recommend him.<//text>

I called Dutton because I had more then just a water plumbing issue with a newly purchased home. I had and issue with the gas line routing for the stove and a huge bird's nest of pipe and tubes for a reverse osmosis system under the kitchen sink that was leaking everywhere. Danny D was the tech that came to my house. He was very nice and was upfront with what he was doing. He fixed the leaks, re-routed the gas line, and we knocked out the documentation, then he left. Shortly after we noticed that sink only had hot water now and the stove needed an additional 90 degree elbow to get it to sit flush with the wall.

We called Dutton and they sent Danny back. Even though it was a Saturday night he stayed to figured out how everything needed to be and got it all working perfect. The previous owners had it so messed up he ended up having to almost re-plumb the entire sink. Great Job and thanks again for staying late to fix everything. that is one less stressful thing I dont need to worry about anymore.</text>

Great service.  Courteous and clean.  Quick and easy.  Craig and Cory replaced our water heater, cut us a great deal and DID NOT try to push a bunch of extra products or services we didn't need like some other plumbers do just to make a few extra bucks.

Couldn't be happier.< /review>

The tech was polite and answered my questions. His quote for $1500 to fix a problem that took me 1hour and cost me $10 was a little much. His work may have been more extensive than what it took to fix the problem but all I wanted was to fix the problem.<//text>

Great Communication. Friendly Service. Had a pool drain rooted. Adam explained the issues, the risks, potential problems, possible extra costs, and let me decide what to do.

Turns out, thankfully, it was straightforward and everything got cleared out.

The home office also did a great job keeping up to date as to delays in getting to me.</text>

I have heard their radio ad on I believe KHAY but have never had a need. When my kitchen drain clogged I googled them, went to the website and called. The whole experience was top notch from the first phone call to writing the check after the technician (Adam) had completed the task.  Adam was friendly yet professional and efficient. He honored the online coupon from the website.
I would definitely recommend them to anyone requiring plumbing service.<//Text>

I had a shower drain that was plugged up and called Dutton for the first time.
The tech they sent out was Brad F. He did an awesome job taking care of the drain issue and performed a safety check on other plumbing related items in the home.
Brad was on time, called before arriving and even wore shoe covers to protect my floors.
Very happy with his performance and will definitely  request Brad if I have another plumbing problem again.<//Review>

<Review>I wouldn't recommend these guys to clean my toilet!
Unfortunately my handyman was not available so I called these guys to clear a drain.
They told me it was against there policy to use a rooter from the roof. They didn't attempt to use a rooter from anywhere else. They used a hydro jet for one hour but didn't clear the plug. Charged me $639.69 for the work.
Solution I found my handy man and he used a rooter from the roof. He cleared the clog in 5 minutes.  Also Dutton recommended having a new drain pipe from the outside replaced for a charge of $6,583. Since the drain has been a recurring problem I did want that done but not by Dutton. No I accepted a bid of $2,000 from another plumber to have the pipe replaced. The work is done and everything is like new everything works perfect. I feel stupid for ever calling Dutton< /Review>< pictures>

We had a plumbing emergency and although we had never used Dutton Plumbing before they were recommended.  We were so please with Chad S.  He was thorough and explained everything that he needed to do to fix our leak.  Additionally he was very helpful in recommending a remediation company that helped with the water damage.  I would recommend Dutton Plumbing and Chad S to anyone with plumbing needs.< /text>

<resp>None</resp><review>Hired Dutton for a sewer repipe. They were fast and professional. Everyone on the crew (2 different crews, 3 different days) were friendly and worked diligently. They're probably a little higher priced than most but I was very comfortable and confident knowing that they would do the job right, which they did. Special shout out to Mark M who really stood out as a five star employee. He's not just super personable, he actually knows his stuff too. He even offered to stop working and help my mother who became very ill in the middle of the job! What plumber does that? Will definitely be using Dutton, and hopefully Mark, for future plumbing disasters. 2 thumbs up!</review>< date>

Jaylyn arrived and was very pleasant from the start and let me know every step of the way what he was doing. He did a quick diagnostic and let me know exactly how much it would be.  Before he started working. After he was done he gave me some helpful hints on how to keep it from reoccurring and let me know the job is guaranteed for 90 days. He was very friendly and professional and I would definitely recommend him to anyone that had  plumbing issues as well asDutton plumbing. My first experience using a plumber was definitely a great one and a  very easy process.</text>

First of all, I would like to thank the technician John Williams who finished the job of replacing the water heater. He did an outstanding job and made sure all the codes are followed as per Federal and State.
Dutton went above and beyond my expectations. I never wrote a review for any services or business. This is my first online review ever. Thats bcoz Dutton has made a unforgettable mark on their service.

Infact the mistake was on my part on the pricing but Dutton took it in a very professional way to make it a smooth transaction. I never seen any business doing that. Right from the Technician John Williams, Helpdesk and to the manager Eric whom I spoke to was very respectful and patience in hearing my concern on the payment.

This is way beyond any service I have ever experienced. I would like to definitely give a 20 star rating If there was one. I have no words to explain beyond this.

Again I appreciate the service and professionalism by Dutton and their people. Thanks again.<//review>

< Review>
Called on a Sunday afternoon. Within 2 hours, Edgar was at my door. Friendly & honest. When he assessed the problem & couldn't do what this situation needed, gave me alternatives, then was on his way with no charge. While the problem wasn't fixed, I give them 4 stars for not taking advantage of a this situation by doing costly repairs that may not be needed.<//Review>

I called many companies before calling Dutton Plumbing. Why I didn't call them first is beyond me. That was my first mistake.  From my past experiences, they're the only company who always comes through for us. When I called in a panic for my client,  the associate on the phone, I believe his name was Dane,  was more than happy to help. He got right on it and followed up with me to let me know my help would be on his way at a certain time.  When the plumber arrived he arrived earlier than expected. Luis Z explained to me and my client,  the owner, what he found wrong and what the estimated cost would be to repair it.  Not only was Luis thorough but he price he quoted was even less because the problem was not as bad as expected. When Luis first arrived he put his booties on at the front door and as he proceeded, he was friendly, professional and very informative. My client,  her family and I give Luis an A+.  Thank you Luis< /text>

If you want a service that doesn't do the job correctly, falsifies information/lies to their customers, provides terrible and rude customer service after they've been paid, breaks customers property without telling them, and refuses to return to fix a problem or get the job done correctly then this is the plumber for you! It took me over a week to get someone to my house for a job, which I get it, they're busy and I understood. Finally when the guy gets here, he goes to the wrong house. Eventually I tracked him down and he went and "completed" his job. Completed as in, it worked for several minutes afterwards and went right back to not working again. He also broke several things in my bathroom and left glass all over the floor. He ripped the toilet up from the floor so now when anybody sits on it, it moves all over the place. He also left the toilet cover on my counter/in my sink. Since I gave him the benefit of the doubt, I believed him when he told me he fixed the problem and never mentioned about breaking anything. When my two year old and I walked into the bathroom we got glass in our feet. I called Dutton immediately and told them what happened and that they needed to send their employee back to fix what he broke. They could have cared less about the glass in my sons feet let alone mine. The rep was extremely rude and said he would call me back, never did. I called again and re-explained the situation and that rep was just as rude as the one before. Plumber never showed back up to fix what he broke, and no matter how many times I've called I've never gotten a call back. I get it, accidents happen, but to break something and leave glass all over a bathroom floor especially when you're aware of small children living in that household has me without words. I went another week and a half without a functioning toilet until I had enough money after the money Dutton Plumbing stole from me. Still not fixed, and still no refund, broken property still not replaced. Thanks Dutton Plumbing!!!< /text>

My experience with Dutton Plumbing and their service specialist was outstanding.  They were fast and very cautious. Checked out everything and made sure that I had options on how to solve my problems.  The work was done professionally and quickly.  The service Specialist Kevin was informative, professional and always had a smile.  The area worked on was cleaned up and left in very nice condition.  Sometimes it is also the small things that count like making sure they covered their shoes before entering the house.  I would use and recommend them anytime.< /text>

<review>Dutton plumbing is a great company to work with.  Very prompt, professional and courteous.  Kevin K and Lou did a great job with our serious under slab leak.  They worked a full day to repair the leak and did a very nice job with clean up.  Major plumbing issues are stressful and they did a fantastic job answering my questions .  Their expertise is unmatched.

Dutton replaced all 50 year old plus cast iron sewage lines under the slab of our house efficiently and with minimal disruption.  Drew L repaired tile in bathrooms and Laundry room expertly with new materials.  Good work.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Dutton employees who've worked on my plumbing issues, from telephone arrangements and a follow-up call, to the excellent service techs Danny & Brian were been very friendly and professional.
Last year I purchased the silver level contract, giving me a full, detailed inspection prior to my recent work. My 40 year-old house had several things that weren't up to today's codes, as well as the usual hard water damage to the plumbing. There were no pressure sales, just recommendations and a convenient list so I was able to prioritize and plan if and when to have various things done.
I heartily recommend this company!< /Review>< Pictures>

We appreciated Diego and the services he provided.  He knows how to listen well, was very professional, courteous, and supportive.  After listening to our issues, he assessed the situation and found the root of our leakage, presented the solutions and carried out the job within the time frame promised.  His team mate, Lon, was also very courteous.

We certainly do not want another water leakage problem but if we ever encounter one again, we know who to look for!

Diego, keep up the good work, you're awesome!  Lon, we know you're on your way!<//Review>

Excellent plumbing company.  Easy to work with and prompt.  I had an unusual outdoor pipe leak and Matt D found it and fixed it which was amazing!  At first we thought we'd have to dig up the front walkway, but he found a way to work around that option.  I was so impressed, I signed a contract for their Preferred Customer package< /text>

<Review>For years, we'd been struggling with a plastic outflow pipe attached to our garbage disposal unit. After finally realizing no amount of duct tape or stacks of old VHS tapes was going to keep that pipe in place, I reached out to Dutton during a courtesy follow up call.

It's worth mentioning they did a great and major job with our upstairs toilet a couple years back, and they put in a new water heater before that.

Yesterday, Technician Ryan came by and took care of our pipe problem quickly and affordably. He was awesome! 10/10 experience, and I can only attempt to describe the joy I felt at basking in such a shiny metal pipe gleaming over a clean under-sink cubby. Thanks again, Dutton! You've got a customer for life.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I highly recommend this company if you need an honest accurate estimate for any plumbing problem. Everyone at Dutton Plumbing was very professional and curious.  I called for an estimate regarding a possible slab leak. The technicians arrived on time as scheduled.  I was greeted at my door by Matt; who immediately placed a clean mat on my door step, put on clean cover shoes over his work shoes. Matt accessed my situation very quickly entered my options with the exact cost on his iPad (which was very reasonable compared to other quotes I received). I opted for the slab fix..the by-pass option would also have fixed the hot water pipe leak in the slab. Within a 30 minutes Matt had located the exact location of the leak, and identified the hot water pipe. He prepared the work area, carefully removed 4 titles (without breaking them) and started the work to open up the cement to access the pipe.  Matt found the copper pipe with the leak. He then very carefully silver soldered the new pipe in place, wrapped the pipe with a thick rubber jacket, back-filled the hole in the slab, poured in quick drying cement to seal the floor. Matt’s work was meticulous, neat and professional. I am one happy customer ..and would recommend you call Dutton Plumbing if you ever need a professional plumbing job. Thanks again Matt for your expertise it is much appreciated.  Tony<//Review>< Pictures>

After the "smell good plumber".told me they can't clear my main line from inside the house, but for $2200 they would add a clean out outside, I called Dutton and Edgar showed up, explained the work and cleaned my line no problem.  He was a pro, did the job and left the area clean.  Can't ask for more than that.... oh wait, they were $30 less than the other plumber too.< /Review>

I was impressed at first with the way Dutton emails/txts you info on the plumber that will be coming out to you home. Then once the plumber came and was doing his tech stuff/slab leak locate-er stuff he started making comments that I really didn't need to hear. Nothing obscene, but I got the feeling that he wasn't confident in the work he was performing. I need confidence, I'm a family of 5, I don't need any uncertainty in the work that's going to be done, fixed and stay fixed.

Amateurs think, Professionals know.

I had a third opinion come out the following day and their findings were different. He didn't find the actual pipe that was leaking and said the leaking area was in a different area than the new plumbers, they are actually repairing/jack hammering it as I type. The job isn't even complete yet, so essentially I don't have a finished product/functioning water system, but I feel more confident in the guys working on it right now.< /text>

First time calling Dutton Plumbing and Rooter. Technician Dan Denney along with a helper responded within 20 minutes. Magnificent. Dan was very professional and friendly showing a meaningful interest in our problem. His explanation was precise and understandable. Employees of Denney’s caliber should never go unnoticed and with this review we want to bring Denney to the attention of management and future customers. Dan Denney and his helper we very clean (seeing their shirts were extremely white) and wore floor shoe covering when entering our home.  We will definitely call Dutton Plumbing if plumbing problems occur. We give Dan Denney and his helper a hardy “atta-boy on a job well done.”</Review>

I had a terrible plumbing problem ( collapsed sewer line) on Christmas eve. Dutton Plumbing to the rescue and Kudos and many thanks to Sean and the Dutton Team for giving me a temporary solution to get me through Christmas and then a follow up to permanently fix the problem. The Dutton Team worked quickly, carefully and were very clear in what was the problem and how it would be resolved.

They truly are the best plumber in the community.</Review>

Horrible customer service and no dependability.  Saw that they rated highly online and decided to give them a call to come evaluate and repair 2 broken faucets and a garbage disposal.  They scheduled the appointment for the following Monday from 1-3 pm.  As monday rolled around, they called only a couple of hours in advance to let us know they were too busy to make the scheduled appointment and rescheduled us for one full week later.  We agreed.  After waiting one full week, they called again, only an hour in advance to let us know that they were again, too busy to make the appointment and tried to reschedule for the FOLLOWING MONDAY!  To this we said absolutely not!  We cleared 2 Monday afternoons based on their schedule and lived 2 full weeks with non functioning appliances, only to be told they could still not service our needs due to their inability to schedule, plan and execute.  DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you want to be jerked around and left hanging.  Tough to imagine all of these positive reviews are real after our experience.  Extremely unprofessional!<//Review>

<text>Mark came out to fix a stopped up toilet. It doesn't get much more professional than this. First, the company calls you to say when they are on their way. Then you get an email with the technician's picture and bio. Mark was very neat, professional and personable. He used rubber booties and assessed the problem right away. He laid down a mat so he didn't make a mess. The problem was solved quickly and resolved. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Ryan J. was a complete pleasure to work with.  He was professional, could answer all my questions, gave me options for the replacement of my old water heater, and didn't pressure me with a hard sell!  He and his assistant (Mario) completed the plumbing task promptly and with no mess left over for me.  I couldn't be happier with their work, and even paid for a year contract with Ryan J. as my plumber for that year.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing in general and Ryan J. specifically.<//Text>

<review>We were experiencing some slow drains.  We called Dutton and they were here in about an hour and a half.  Jay was very polite, made notes as I explained what I could about the problem.   He inspected under the building  (prefab) and recommended clearing the drain from the house to the street.  During the process,  he hit a couple of blockages that cleared out.  He also recommend a bio cleaner for the PVC plumbing.  Overall, fast arrival, thorough work, and pleasant service.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I wasnt home when Adam came to my house, but both my daughter and husband went on about how professional, knowledgeable,  and pleasant Adam was.

Since I don't know a thing about plumber prices, I was kinda stunned at the price for the services I needed. Seems about average though.

Will definitely use Dutton Plumbing again if the need arises.

UPDATE: We ended up needing DUTTON PLUMBING again and Andy really was just as great as my family said. Will never use another plumber again!!<//text>

<user>104397000766748447249<//user><review>Jesse L was great to deal with.  He arrived ahead of time, but I was called with updates on his schedule so I was ready.  He gave us an easy to understand estimate for the work and completed the work very efficiently.  He even did extras like checking our water pressure and the condition of our water heater.  He left the workspace clean, neat and dry.  He didn't just fix and leave, he ran water and reinspected his work twice with time between just to make sure everything was okay before he left.  He actually left the whole assembly looking better than the original builder of the house.
I would give Dutton and Jesse L more than five stars if I could!</review><gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140< /gmap_id>< rate>

Dutton Plumbing was wonderful, no waiting and wondering if and when they would arrive.  We received phone updates as to when they would arrive.  They were quick, clean, and courteous.  Ryan, Dave and Tyler are in our opinion the best plumbers in Simi Valley.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.<//review>

This morning I had a dishwasher delivery from home depot,  they were going to install it as well.  I was told that they couldn't because the valve was frozen and I should call a plumber.  I called Dutton around 8am and they were at my house before 9..they were polite and professional....The did a great job and were able to install things necessary that the other old plumber had " forgotten" include... The entire job was done completely and quickly.  I spent more then I had hoped to but I fell the job was done right and have one less thing to worry about   Thank you Ryan and Mario    Susan<//review>

O contracted Dutton Plumbing yesterday at 10 am due to the pool water faucet line leaking. I explained that I had to be at my daughter's high school graduation at 5:30 pm. Diego arrived at approximately 1:30 pm. He completed the repairs at 4:30 pm allowing my family to be on time for the ceremony.  I appreciated his professionalism and attention to detail.  I have used Dutton Plumimg services 3 times now, and I highly recommend  this company.</review>

Randy A was my plumber today -- great guy, clean in appearance, and he worked quickly.  The job was done well, and he made sure he answered any questions I had.</Text>

< review>
I had a drainage leak beneath my kitchen sink.  I tried fixing it for three days myself but it would not stop leaking. Admitting defeat I called Dutton Plumbing.  They sent on over Steve S. who looked over the situation and gave me an estimate.  Normally I would have gotten three bids but after three days of fighting leaks that trashed my bottom cabinet shelf, I relented figuring if it was good enough for Mom, then go with it.  Steve explained the piping was the PVC pipe, gaskets and slip rings were old and best replaced entirely. After four hours of work, except for the Garbage Disposal, everything was replaced. The leaks stopped. Cost was not cheap but the fix seemed to be working and with a year warranty on their work, I was satisfied. Unfortunately the next day a weep formed under my right sink .  I called Dutton Plumbing and set up another appointment.  They wanted to send Steve out again to repair it but he was diverted for an emergency repair.  However they honored their warranty and sent out Juan P.  who determined another gasket was needed and fixed the issue at no further cost.  It is now three days later and no further leaks as of the writing of this review.  My wife and I say MOM Approves.</review>

Paul and Robert came to our mobile home to try to correct an AC water leak that 4 other companies could not repair because they would not crawl other the coach. Although they were unable to find the problem they referred me to a company they highly recommended.  Not only did they provide a service no one else would do by going under the house they did not charge one cent!! Now that is what I call great customer service and TWO GREAT GUYS.</review>

<user_name>Freda Falk-Santoro< /user_name><Time>1524259507726<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>After a frantic call to Dutton Plumbing regarding 'no water' to our home, we were fortunate to have Randy Arnold from Sutton Plumbing come to our home in less than an hour to review and evalute the problem.
Randy not only knows his business extensively,  you immediately feel his compassion, awareness and thoughtfulness towards the homeowner and the 'crisis' they are experiencing.  After much thought and conversation between Randy and my hiusbanc, Randy fixed the problem.  He was extremely helpful and considerate in moving many long hoses from place to place to be sure that our horses had water while the work was being done and then putting the hoses all back in place.  We feel fortunate that our paths crossed and he will most certainly be the 1st person we would call in the event of another plumbing issue.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>Bernardo Alcala was the service pro who came out to clear our sewer line.
He initially cleared the line but with the camera saw cement rocks that had come dislodged and would just clog up the line again in the future. He and his assistant Guillermo worked for 3 hours to remove the loose rocks from the sewer line "by hand fishing" with a coat hanger, the camera, and the 3000 PSI hydro jet. They did a great job, but what I admired the most was their persistence in making certain the line was clear and nothing left behind. These guys were friendly, knowledgeable,
professional and persistent with a can do spirit. They are a credit to Dutton Plumbing and I will not hesitate in calling them again.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<date>1507092166616<//date><Text>After having called numerous local plumbers who didn't bother to show up or even call back, I called Dutton Plumbing to fix an outdoor PVC pipe leak, and I couldn't be happier. Dan & Jake were 100% professionals and fixed the problem in 40 minutes. Even the dispatcher on their customer service line was helpful.

Ritz Plumbing tried and failed to fix the pipes 5 times in a row and - in fact, made the problem worse after each visit. After Ritz Plumbing gave up (and tried to extort additional money for warranty work), Dutton Plumbing was there to pick up the pieces AND show me exactly what negligence and shoddy workmanship caused my the leak in the first place.

Dan & Jake were knowledgeable, experienced, and more than helpful with their explanations and suggestions. They showed up ON TIME and within hours of being called. They even stayed on for an extra hour or so after the job was completed so they could test that the leak was indeed corrected. Dutton Plumbing warrants the work for 1 year after the visit and as Dan put it: "We will own our mistakes and not charge you extra."  Too bad more companies aren't like this.< /Text>< user>

<Review>Dutton pulled a bait-and-switch by trying to get me to agree to a $25,000 overhaul of our plumbing system for a basic repiping job, which should have cost 1/3 of that amount. The job would have entailed ripping up our front yard, and replacing a perfectly good, recently installed water heater. Then they proceeded to disparage another company we were considering. I will never work with this company.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Jay N. Was my plumber mainly and he was great. Very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating of my schedule. I had quite a lot of plumbing work done ( replaced 2 toilets, 2 sinks/ vanities, new kitchen faucet, and replaced main sewer line out to the street.). During all this work, dispatch sent other plumbers, who were also great. I would recommend any of the plumbers. My only problem was with dispatch, who did not seem to comprehend the scope of the work being done on a house built in the 1950's. Dispatch often would schedule Jay to come at 5pm, and he wouldn't be able to make it, as he was on another job and couldn't make it. So, if there was another plumber available they would send them, but that late in the day, it was difficult for them to complete a job. So, I feel that had the dispatcher used better judgement and gave the plumbers extra time to complete a job ( allow for old plumbing - things do go wrong ), my large job could have been done in a more timely manner.</Review>

Diego and Louis did an excellent job.  They were on time, presented them selves very professionaly, worked hard, good communication.  Met our needs and special requests.  The cost of the job was much higher than anticipated, as quoted by Paul, who never again showed up on the job.

<rate>5</rate><review>We needed a repair done quickly because our washing machine could not be repaired until it was done. Sean (and one other person) from Dutton Plumbing came the same day we called, within two hours of calling. Both were professional and nice. They fixed our problem and helped check for leaks. Sean was great about answering my questions and wanting to help us figure out why our water bill was so high, too. I always enjoy finding companies who come quickly and are easy to talk to!  I can’t speak on pricing because we did not get any other quotes since this needed to be done quickly.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Second time I have used Dutton Plumbing and this experience was again exceptional!  I unfortunately had a toilet tank overflow and James C and Ryan D were my technicians, who were absolute professionals and knowledgeable in all areas regarding my toilet issue, also checked water pressure regulator (another issue) and replacement of another toilet potential problem in downstairs bathroom.  I can sing them praises as they are highly trained, efficient and best of all friendly!  I do need to follow up for further plumbing concerns and specifically will ask for James and Ryan -- good friends, good job and good employees!  Give them a bonus -- Dutton Plumbing has experienced long-term employees (that says a lot for quality standards and performance). Bene, bene grazie!< /Text>< name>

<review>After a long day, I had to come home and deal with a completely blocked sewer.  Having utilized Dutton Plumbing several times before, I did not waste any time deciding which plumbing company to call.  A quick call, followed by a return call to confirm the time frame when the plumber would show up, and not much longer after that, the plumber showed up.  Friendly.  Professional.  Considerate.  He got right to the job and took care of the problem.  Thank you very much!</review><GmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Awesome service ethics! Thanks Matt for helping us and fixing the recurring issue! I have First American Home Buyers Protection, and their contract plumbing company could not fix a simple issue. And they were blaming something which was not at all the main cause of problem. Thanks to Matt, he came and fix the issue the very first time itself!< /Text>

I am a young, single mother and Dutton's technicians basically tried to rob me. A 5 or 6 inch piece of exposed PVC pipe between two connectors on my sprinkler valve broke. I called Dutton and they sent their technician Matt out with another tech (not sure why they sent TWO people when I told them it was literally just a piece of PVC that needed to be removed and replaced). If I knew how to deal with the blue PVC cement I would have fixed the damn thing myself. So Matt and tech 2 show up and tell me "Oh, yeah that's an easy fix. We'll just have to dig around it a little bit and I'll charge you the exposed rate so it won't be as much for you." Tech 2 is in the grass kicking a soccer ball around with my daughter. They're really laying it on thick getting my guard down. So... now it comes time for them to rig up the invoice and get my signature... $450!!! Are you kidding me?! At first, because I have no idea what I'm doing, I was going to agree to it. Thankfully my roommate got home in the nick of time and told them that we would get a second opinion. My father came by and fixed it in less than 10 minutes. Dutton was going to rob a young, single mother of $450 for a $5 piece of PVC, some PVC cement, and 7 minutes of labor. How could anyone be so heartless and money hungry?< /Review>

Good work but way too expensive. There's a lot of cheaper plumbers that would do the same or better quality of work for not even half the price.<//text>

I would get others to bid the work. My wife called these guys when I was traveling for work and asked them to hook up the washer dryer (we just moved) and fix a diverter. They charged her $500 and then tried to up sell her on $20,000 worth of work. We will call around next time and don't plan to use them again.<//review>

<Review>All I can say is... GET A SECOND OPINION!! ... I had 1 bath room with  a clogged sink and toilet.. They said my pipes were broke under the house and the one pipe in front was cracked.. They said I needed ALL new plumbing at a cost of $12,000.00.. I questioned this because the rest of my plumbing was working fine.. I said I thought $12,000.00 was slightly extreme and their answer was "Well we do financing"  They never showed me any pictures or video that was used during the inspection.. I told them no thank you and without any other options from them, they left.. I called another company who came with their camera and showed me that the main entrance where he used his camera had not even been opened due to it being covered with dirt and spider webs. He then had me watch the video of the inside of my plumbing (amazing btw..) to show me no broken pipes but areas where there was settling that was causing pooling and due to build up, caused the clogs.. He flushed out the pipes with a hydro hose and viola... no clogs.. Oh and there was NO cracked pipes in the front either.. He was gracious enough to show me everything that he was doing so that I could understand..He charged me $625.00... I don't know if that is a good or bad price for what he did but, I do know it is a far cry from $12,000.00..  Shame on you Dutton Pluming !! If I could give you 0 stars I would!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I felt at ease working with her, especially after a negative experience with a previous service provider.  The appointment set up was very easy and when I was unable to keep the initial appointment, the dispatchers called back right away and followed up the next morning with a "first call of the day" appointment.  My technician was Kyle.  He was on time, friendly, reassuring and expert in his work.  He showed me everything that he was doing and explained the problem (which was due to some apparent ineptitude by the previous service provider.  Kyle didn't try to upsale me on any services.  He pointed out options that would save me money in the near and long term.  I was very satisfied.  My only regret is that I didn't call Dutton the first time around.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Called 4 times, spoke with Katie 2 times, she was nice but the technician never called me back. In their defense I called 5 plumbing companies to look at my non-functional water heater. NO ONE WOULD CALL OR COME OUT TO MY HOUSE!!!!!!  Money was not a problem, my landlord is paying for it. Is it possible that all plumbing companies have so much money and are so busy that they can't even call back??? Cold showers won't cut it in the morning. I will fix it myself tomorrow or find someone who cares enough to at least call back!  Shame on all af you! My kids are going to suffer through freezing showers in the morning I hope you you are happy. VERY WEAK!!!!< /text>

Got a call from Kayla at Dutton saying that a technician would be out to check on our plumbing.  Dutton was here in January and replaced our waste system under the house and our experience with them was excellent.  Today was a courtesy service at no charge.  Emanuel T was the technician and just prior to his arrival which coincided with the appointment time I received a notification call from Chris.  Emanuel T checked appropriate plumbing and water heater for any problems.  He was prompt, quick, neatly dressed with clean shoe covers and very courteous and left a complete report of his visit and said if we experienced any problems to call Dutton. I appreciate the service.< /Text>

Home inspection today from Danny D.  I was very pleased how he checked all problem areas, found the cause and made the necessary corrections quickly and efficiently.  He was clean and courteous and continued his inspection by checking our tankless waterheater and installing cards designating emergency shut off valves for gas and water on the appliance.  He also inspected the water line coming into the house and checked water pressure.  He was also extremely informative and was most helpful.  I definitely give him my highest rating.<//text>

My tech was Kevin K.  He was fast, friendly, and cleaned up very well after himself.  I had a broken toilet seal.  He investigated the area, asking for what I had noticed, before coming to the same conclusion as I had.  We ended up having to replace our toilet, as it broken after he removed the base screws.  He work quick, he cleaned up very nicely, and explained everything he found, he did, and to look out for in the future before he left.  Great job Kevin!  Thank you!<//Review>

The plumber was courteous did some clean up of water damage.
He cut 2 rectangular holes in the ceiling, wallboard, I guess to drain water.
My question now is who is going to repair the cut holes in the ceiling?
Please advise.< /Text>

<review>Nick G is a super professional guy with tremendous amount of patience, courtesy and knowledge. I wish most of service guys and gals are like him. He takes tremendous amount of care and listens to the customer. He is persistent and won't quit till he fixes the problem. Two other plumbers gave up before him but he kept snaking till the back up was all cleared. Super fantastic guy. Don't make him a manager coz you need more people like Nick in the field who are great testimonial for Dutton! Thanks Nick!</review>< Pics>

Terrible!!  They claim "Outstanding Customer Service" and " a plumber you would send to your mother house"  Canceled my appointment with them 3 times!!  Always calling at the last minute and making some sort of excuse.  Talked to a guy named Vince- who as sharp as a marble, and seemed totally lost in trying to come up with an excuse.  Ask for the owner of the company to call me.  Took time off all three times to be here for them.
TOO MANY GOOD PLUMBING COMPANIES OUT THERE- RUN FROM THIS ONE!!<//Text>

Diego did a good professioal job repairing our M Mouse plumbing situation. He did the job in late July 2018.  He came back,  as agreed, in August to hook up the drain line for our dishwasher after we got our RO issues corrected. .
Diego is polite, patient,explains things well and was alwaye careful to wear shoe covers.<//Text>

Danny D and Leo B provided service for our residence on a leaking faucet and water pressure regulator. Danny was the main technician and Leo assisted him. Danny was very knowledgable, professional, courteous and friendly. He took time to explain the problem to us, how he planned to approach remedying it and the relative costs. As for expertise and professionalism, their service was excellent. I was especially pleased by Dan's positive professional demeanor. They were prompt, finished the work within the quoted timeframe, explained their process beforehand so we knew exactly what services we were receiving, and they left their workspace as clean as they found it. As for cost, we have worked with less expensive plumbers in the past, so Dutton is not the most competitive provider in terms of pricing, however with Dan's professionalism and a very organized business service model (we have not experienced a more organized effort, from front office to completion), customers can reasonably expect to pay a bit more than what a sole provider/owner-operator would charge that doesn't offer such a comprehensive service model, which includes your initial call, prompt scheduling, phone updates, e-mail updates and accurate time estimations for both technician arrival and work performance. We might have been able to shop around for a cheaper solution since this call was not an emergency call, but overall, we feel we have received value for our dollar.<//Text>

This past week I was in need of a plumber.........Mon., 12/23 I called and Tues., 12/24 Matt D from Dutton Plumbing came to my house.
When I initially called, I told Vince that I needed muscle and not brains for a pretty simple job with one small glitch.
Here comes Matt with the muscle AND the brains to solve the glitch that two other people could not! And with the brains came a big heart. Matt is the complete package.
Dutton Plumbing is very, very, very lucky to have Matt D. And I am lucky to have Dutton Plumbing to call when I need help.
Thank you Dutton and thank you Matt.

OK, so here's the deal. Supposedly................the 2nd time is never as good as the 1st, Well not with Dutton Plumbing. Matt D far surpassed his 1st visit. Here's the fun part, he was with another plumber named Matt.....so I just called them Matts. They did a beautiful job. Thank you Dutton and thank you Matt D.

Earlier in the year we had some MAJOR plumbing issues with our main sewer line and stumbled upon Dutton. Not only were they quick to come out but they truly sincerely care about their customers and will work with you. Since then they've helped replace parts on or water heater and most recent unclogged a shower drain. Everyone from their dispatch to technicians are knowledgeable and polite. Best of all their prices are reasonable. I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of. They will continue to be our "go to" for ask my plumbing needs. Thank you Dutton!!</Text>

My experience with Dutton Plumbing was excellent. The service Pro was Rich B. He explained all
my options in great detail and pointed out some very bad issues that had developed. Over the last three weeks my 1961 home needed a complete new pipe replacement. Since this requires going through the cement foundation I saw many Dutton employees. Dutton had every type of specialists needed to do the job. They were all very professional and knew there jobs. They finished the job when promised and put my house back the way it had been.<//Text>

<review>Two days before Christmas and everything in my house is backing up into my tub. I tried to fix it myself, and got nowhere. I called up Dutton at 3:30pm and they said they could get someone out there that afternoon. I got a text with a quick bio and picture of the Plumber that would be out, his name was Felix and was great. At 5pm he arrived. He crawled under my house to check the plumbing, made a quick assessment and advised me what I may need to do in the near future since my plumbing was so old.

I sat down with my wife and let him work and after a short while I heard that beautiful sound of water draining. Wrapped up quick afterwards, gave me a few tips and took my payment, which was great at only 73 dollars (with their special for clearing drains).

I was very happy with Felix and the entire experience with Dutton, and would highly recommend them.< /review><user_id>115476423726475223039</user_id></record>

<Time>1527954815437<//Time><rate>1</rate><review>I have been a faithful customer of Dutton for over 15 years.  Thursday night around 9pm I entered my garage only to find my hot water heater leaking water.  I immediately contacted Dutton's 24 hour emergency service number plastered on the front of the hot water heater they installed, only to find out that they no longer provide 24 hour emergency services and that some one would contact me the next day. I could not wait and had to search for another plumber in the yellow pages.  Another came to my rescue and turned off the water heater, disconnected the gas line after turning it off and drained the tank of the remaining water.  I could not for the life of me understand a plumbing service not offering 24 hour emergency services.  Dutton came next day to offer to install a new hot water heater for an astronomical cost.  I searched the Web and believe I found an excellent new plumber and they are installing my new hot water heater as we speak and at half the cost of Dutton's quote.  And they offer 24 hour emergency services!  I have a new Plumber!
GOOD-BYE DUTTON!<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Returned home from a vacation to find a broken pipe in my front yard and had to shut off the water from the street.   Call Dutton Plumbing and was told that someone would be out between 8 and 10am.   Ryan J showed up at 8:45.   20 feet of galvanized piping need to be replaced with copper and Ryan recommend installing a ball shut off value.   Ryan gave me price up front with no hidden cost.   Ryan was able to restore water to the house while he replaced the broken pipe.    He finished the job with in 2 1/2 hours and my yard looked like he was never there (minus the pool of water).   Ryan was very polite, clean, explained everything he was going to do and answered all of my questions.   Thanks Ryan.    Dutton prices are higher then other plumbers but the quality of work and service you get I feel it is worth it.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
My parent's just purchased a mobile home and the hot water heater was broken. They called Dutton Plumbing to come out and Diego was the technician at that time. My dad being a contractor was sure we would have to replace it. Diego could have easily taken their money and replaced the water heater with no complaints from them but instead, he took his time, looked everything over and found a fantastic solution to not have to replace the whole water heater. In the end, Diego saved my parents over a thousand dollars and was extremely friendly.

After that Diego and Kevin came out because the water system that is currently in the house is horrible. They were friendly and professional while bending over backwards to get my dad the price he wanted and my mom the system she wanted. The manager Shawn was also awesome in working with Kevin. I highly recommend them!< /Review>

<Review>The technician was great and he did an excellent job.  He was  curtious and friendly.  He explained what he was doing.  Should get a raise. The only complaint that I have is that the cost of the job was outrageous for 2 hrs of work putting in a faucet.  Which was an automatic charge.  Approx. $460.  Dont  think I would use them again 2nd time the price was way over charged. Not doctor's or lawyer who always over charge.  Tech was great thou.

<text>I called Dutton Plumbing because they all showed up at Starbucks in Porter Ranch on a number of occasions and bought everyone coffee.  They quickly schedule a plumber to come fix my broken shut off valve for the backyard irrigation so there would be no further flooding.  I received an email shortly thereafter with a picture of Jake M who would be coming to fix my broken valve.  When he arrived, he discovered that the shut off valve from the city was frozen shut, so he had to call DWP to come and close the valve.  They said it might be 2 - 3 hours or longer, and he told me just to call him whenever DWP showed up and he would come back and fix my broken valve.  He then called DWP to have them come turn the water back on, and, since he could not test the new valve he installed, Jake showed me how to check it.  He said if there was any leakage to call him and he would come right back and fix any problems.  I know the complication with the city's valve made extra work for him, but I was not charged any additional fee, and he got me a $50 discount coupon because I called after meeting Dutton Plumbing at Starbucks.  I could not be more satisfied for the professionalism that Jake demonstrated, and his willingness to see the job through no matter what extra time or inconvenience arose due to outside complications.  Without reservation, I extend my highest recommendation for Dutton Plumbing because of the outstanding service that Jake provided.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1531236786582, 'text': "Hello there Wendy :)\nOh coffee caravans were so much fun.

Had Dutton plumbing come out for a yearly check up of my plumbing, something that Dutton offers to their existing customers.  ANDREW E. Come out and was very professional and  very friendly.  He took his time and explained exactly what was going to happen and what I should expect from his visit. If all of Dutton's plumber are as professional as Andrew E. They could sure count on having a life time customer.
Thank you Dutton for sending Andrew E. To my house.<//Review>

Response time is second to none.  I always get a call an hour prior to arrival confirming they are on their way.  This time when Ken got here the toilet was leaking (go figure).  He checked everything out inspection-wise and suggested we replace a few minor things which we could do ourselves and the charge was zero.  What other company does that????!!!!!<//Review>

Marc of Dutton plumbing came by to hook up my barbecue to my house's natural gas.  Since this was a manufactured home the fittings were a bit tricky.  Marc and his apprentice James C took it all in stride.  Even though they had to go chase down some parts to complete the job they didn't stop  (unlike another plumbing company that threw there arms up).   Since, I've recommended Dutton to my neighbor with a washer problem.  These guys are the real pros!  Thank you Marc and James!!< /text>

We were able to manage until late afternoon when the technician arrived.  Armando was clean, polite and responsive to our questions.  He also wore protective covers over his shoes  and used a  floor mat to protect our floor, which we appreciated.  Before starting the job, he explained our options and associated costs and did not pressure us in any way.  He was extremely conscientious and tested all of his work before leaving our home.   It was refreshing to have a technician who actually took pride in his work.

We had a slow shower drain for a few days then it erupted into a full on blockage that left us without service. We called at 7am and by 9am Adam was at our door. I took him right to the backyard where the septic was backed up at and Adam went to work. He was friendly, professional and knowledgeable. He made a few expert suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again and what may need to be diagnosis for future septic issue that will occur later due to age of plumbing system. Unlike my experience with other plumbing companies, Adam didn't try to pressure me to buy any unwanted or unnecessary repairs. He fix the problem and made some suggestions. I would highly recommend this company to any homeowner who is tired of being taken advantage of and who just wants great quality professional and on time repair.

I've used Dutton Plumbing for my home for many years.  They have  always been prompt, explained what was happening and how to repair the problem, and gave a quick and concise cost estimate for the project.  Ultimately I've had the entire house repiped to eliminate those ongoing annoyances that happen in an older home.  So far so good.  Many crews have been to the house, have performed their duties and left the property clean.  Matt and his apprentice Jake on the final day of the latest project were quick and left the area clean.  I use Dutton for all my plumbing needs.< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>We've been on the family service plan with Dutton Pluming of a few years now.  The annual service inspection includes a water heater flush, general pluming inspection and Bio-Clean drain treatment.  Our house is over 20 years old and has its share of plumbing issues.  To prevent these issues, Dutton Plumbing installed a pressure control regulator 3 or 4 years ago, but warned the hard water in the area would take its toll.  This year we had two more leaks.  We requested Luis Zamarripa as our annual service technician.  He is an excellent, dependable technician and he drives PINK DUTTON PLUMBING TRUCK.  10% of the profits from the PINK trucks go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
Luis recommended a whole house water filter to which we agreed.  He included the leak repair and did an excellent installation job.  We got an 18 month same as cash deal so it was very affordable.
Great job Luis Z.  Larry C. you have a great team!

We had Luis Zamarripa back on 9/12/18 to install a pre-purchased RO unit under our kitchen sink.  The installation concerned me because Luis Z. and Lon Ralston had to cut a new hole in the sink to mount the RO faucet.  The installation was perfect. No cracks in the sink, which is over 20 years old, and NO LEAKS under the sink.  I've been told that can be a common problem with RO installations.
Additionally, Luis and Lon, replaced our old dishwasher air gap.  We requested this extra work and asked for the air gap to match our upgraded sink faucet.  The match is a good one and the Luis and Lon's workmanship is excellent.

Dutton Plumbing maintains its 5 STAR rating in my house!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>An excellent employee and a hard worker.
I had what looked like an easy job at first but the guys who rebuilt this house put a lot of curve balls in for the poor Heyner.

Well he did not give up and kept on trying other solutions. All while my kids kept on asking if he liked monster trucks, cars, movies, horses, how old he is, what are you doing.
He replied always with a smile and got the job done.
Cleaned up thoroughly after the main job was and had time to talk options for payments and contracts.

I am rating Dutton Plumbing POOR for price not for any other reason. A few months back...I was trying to install three faucets in my house when I found one of the old ones... "water flex hose" refused to come off....it's always something when I fool with plumbing. I didn't want to force it because then I would have to shut off the main. Sooo we were forced to call a plumber. We found Dutton on line and they came within 2 hours. Nice truck...3 guys...it looked like a trainer and 2 other guys. This was a very simple job...just remove the stuck hoses and finish putting in the faucets. When I asked about the cost...they referred to a large book that already had all costs printed for any kind of plumbing job. FOR My 20 minute job they would charge around $300....which is really insane!!! I think the only way for me to get the price down to around $200. was to install the faucets myself...while these 3 guys looked on and then they hooked up the water flex hoses  in 10 minutes....according to their book that would be cheaper???? ...incidentally after they left one of the bathroom sinks was leaking when the water drains....but I didn't dare call them back!!!  I will never call them again!!!< /Text>

Dutton Plumbing is always responsive and sends the very best technicians to the job. I will use them for all my plumbing needs and especially recommend Kevin.<//text>< resp>

< Review>
Brett P and Tyler dug out and capped a buried gas line at a city Public Works yard. They saw-cut and jackhammered asphalt, then dug down 2 feet to reach a joint and place the cap.  This was a physically demanding job that took a full day. Both guys were great.  They worked safely and efficiently, and never complained.  They also cleaned the work area thoroughly afterward.  Brett's equipment was in good shape, and neatly organized in his truck (I always look for this with contractors). I would hire them again anytime. Thanks!< /Review>

O K guys ,,,, let us have people to perform trades like Mark and we will all be survivors of the mass of lying "contractors" that take our money and provide promises for tomorrow.
Mark an his worker SOLVED problems that were out of their realm of or scope of what they were called in to work on.
This is usually only found in an owner''s work ethic except the last 6 sbusiness owners that I have had over here for projects ,,,  requested prices well shall we say ,,,  we'll in excess of the going rate,,, as well as two companies which drew me in based upon FALSE weblistings......   claiming that they had no idea ..... yea right ....<//Text>

<text>My technician was a nice guy, and very knowledgeable, and I would have liked to do business with Dutton, but his $1,150 estimate to replace a garbage disposal was ridiculous.  He also bid to replace a gas line on my water heater to the tune of $480.00.  I can only assume that Dutton puts out totally unbelievable bids knowing that a few customers will actually give in and pay their outrageous rates.</text>< Pictures>

<review>I was so impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of Felix. He was knowledgeable about all the things I had concerns about. His answers to my many questions were clear and unhurried. Felix was able to complete the repairs my house needed and I was able to plan for upgrades of equipment I would like to install.
My house was built in the 1960's and I have wondered many times how I could protect my home from possible pipe breakages or who I could call if these "water disasters" occurred. I know that Felix and Dutton have my back. Thank you so much!</review><rating>5</rating>< Time>

Chad arrived on time, introduced himself, and was dressed in a clean uniform. He placed shoe covers over his shoes to keep my carpet clean.  I explained my plumming issues to Chad. He listened and repeated the issues back to me, to insure he understood my concerns. Chad inspected the parts in questions, he pointed out the problems, and provided me a short tutorial on the function of each part.

Chad provided me with several options to repair the damaged parts along with the final costs for each option.

The work was completed in a timely fashion and Chad left the area clean.  I was shown the new parts, as well as the old parts Chad removed. Chad was personable, professional, and I felt comfortable enough with Chad that I left him in my home alone while I ran several errands.

I would use Dutton Plumbing for my future needs and Chad represented the compony well.</Text>

<Date>1521741185450</Date><rate>5</rate><Review>4.6 starts really, 5 if he had been lucky enough to guess to try clearing the clog from inside first instead of from outside the house, and if he had made it a little more clear there would NOT be any high-pressure sales pitch regarding what keeps causing our clogs.  Persistence paid off and a 30 minute effort turned into almost an hour as his second guess worked.
Mark arrived quickly, was very professional, was clean even though it was a 7 pm call, asked if we wanted a free scope run the next day to find out why we have these issues every year or two now, and only charged us the $73 basic fee for a clog with access.  They just left after the scoping and THERE WAS NOT EVEN A LOW PRESSURE SALES PITCH.  The Mike Diamond commercials sound OK, but Rusty Dutton beats their price and they both seem to have the same exclusions and conditions for unclogging drains.  MARK M. at Dutton Plumbing has our business to deal with. . .um. . . 'our business'.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Ryan was nice but the cost of my repair was way more than I was expecting it to be. A $22 toilet tune up ended up costing $297. My neighbor who is a plumber asked to look at the repair and said the parts were about $10 so now feel really ripped off. Very upset with Dutton plumbing and will not ever use them again!

I would now like to add that after speaking with an extremely nice man named Andrew, everything was made right  and am back to only paying the original $22. Am so happy that they took care of this in such a professional way and would now rate them 5 stars. Thank you Dutton Plumbing.</Review>< pictures>

After some confusion using the chat on the Dutton website I received immediate assistance from Olivia on the phone. Within minutes of speaking with her David Walker's info was received by email and text. David arrived within the hour and rectified my water heater problem in minutes. He then offered to service the water heater for less than the cost of a service call from a home warranty company. He cleaned the sediment out, checked all the gas connections and parts then blew any dust and creatures away. He was done in 45 minutes. I have used Dutton before and have been very happy with the work. I have always recommended them.< /Text>

Steve in investigated the system and then made the diagnosis which
appears to have been a faulty valve.

<Text>Consumer beware. I called Dutton plumbing for a leak in the drain pipe to my washing machine. The plumber looks at the job site and immediately tells me that the cost of the repair will be $2200.00. I was floored. Then after I told him that i would get other estimates we couldn't get him to leave.He kept talking about this and that and when he found out that we had a cat he talk another 30 minutes about how great cats were.I did find a legitimate plumber and they did a great job. The cost $240.00.

<Review>Brandon  arrived on time  and was able to determine what he thought the problem might be and went about solving it.  It ended up being a little more than we originally thought but he wasn't deterred and was finally able to get things as they should be.
He was patient, kind and thoughtful.  Cleaned up after himself and was able to schedule a follow up appointment for me right away.  I would definitely recommend him as well as your company to anyone needing your service.  I will call you again in the future.  Thank you!

<Text>Had home service yesterday and was very lucky to get Ryan J.
as your  rep.

He was extremely professional and was obviously well trained
as he dealt with several issues that we had at home.

We were very pleased with him and would suggest he be anyone's

<response>None</response><review>I want to thank Dutton Plumbing for the work performed at my house. Every aspect of the experience was first class - from setting up the appointment (your office staff is excellent) to Kevin Kalin and his crew arriving at the scheduled time.
Kevin's professionalism immediately put me at ease, he and Paul Belcher thoroughly explained what the job would entail, gave me a quote and competed the work that day as promised at the price they quoted, no surprises. Great job!

I live in a home built in 1965 with old galvanized pipe under my tri-level home in my lower bathroom.  This pipe had completely deteriorated and not draining at all to the street sewer line.  My technician assigned to my overwhelming project was Diego Magana, under his manager Paul Belcher.  This crew managed to get me financing in order to move forward with  correcting my plumbing problem.

Over the three weeks, they worked with me on scheduling the time to get the job done.  My home was their concern and they were very careful to see that the area they had to work was kept as clean as possible while they jack-hammers my lower level floor to get down to the pipes for replacement.

My thanks go out to not only Paul Belcher and Diego Magana, but a big thank you to the workers that dug the 4.4 foot hole, then the refilling and and getting the bathroom back to  the its former order.  They did a great job.

Some of these workers are:  Miguel, Edgar P., Edgar B., Manuel, Luis and Noel.  I hope I got all the names of those that were here and I hope I did not miss any names.  A big thanks you to all.  They all did a great job!!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I had to have a water heater replaced. I called about 4pm on friday night. Kevin Kalin from Dutton arrived less than one hour later. He was accompanied by another tech. Kevin explained what had to be done and gave me an estimate. Both Kevin and his helper were professional and informative. The workmanship was excellent. Before they left, Kevin said if for any reason, I had any problems, to call right away and it would be attended to. Should I have further plumbing needs, I will call Dutton Plumbing.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Bryan C from Dutton Plumbing came to our rescue today!  Our plumbing was clogged - affecting 2 bathtubs, 2 toilets and 3 sinks.  We called Dutton plumbing and Bryan was at our house in about an hour!  He assessed the situation and flushed the lines.  Another field team member came to help thread a camera through to find the problem.  Unfortuntately, we got an estimate for a big job that needs to be done but we were aware of our home's plumbing issues and were expecting it.  Through it all, Bryan was super courteous, knowledgeable, professional and friendly.  We would definitely recommend both Bryan and Dutton plumbing!!</review>

Technician came on 9/30/2017 and three days later I had a drain completely clogged. My guess that Manuel T. (tech. name did the cleaning in dry or did not get to the street level. Anyways when I called the Dutton Plumbing about this emergency they sent to me the same guy and he suggested to me to change the drain. This advice I am getting for already 15 years because there is a crack in the pipe. Not much to add, he was not up to helping but rather trying to proof that he did a good job in the first time two days earlier. I am greatly disapointed with Dutton and would like share this experience to help somebody and avoid this so called "plaumbing service"

<Review>I had Dutton Plumbing do a complete Main line replacement and water line replacement including new tankless water heater's at my 4 Plex rental property.  Chad Schull was lead Technician with Paul Belcher as Dutton Plumbing  Management Technician.  I was able to count on Chad and Paul to make sure this large job was done quickly and correctly with the least amount of inconvenience to Tenants at the Property.  Chad worked after hours to insure Tenants had Water and hot Water with only a few hours of water shut off.  I had excellent communication from the Company and with Chad and Paul as to all factors concerning the job.  I new upfront what the job would intel and how much it would cost.  Dutton Plumbing stands behind it's work and I have a 20 year Guarantee on parts and labor. I believe it is well worth the cost to have peace of mind that all work was completed accurately with a Guarantee.  I would highly recommend Dutton Plumbing Company to anyone and especially to someone that has a large job and needs a large crew to come in and complete job quickly and have it  done right!< /Review>< Name>

We had a drain backup in our shower. We called dutton plumbing and they offered to send someone in 15 mins. That was too soon for us, so they worked around our schedule and sent a technition when it was more convenient for us. When Ramiro showed up he immediately handed me his card and told me his name and that he was with dutton. He wore the shoe covers and came with me to inspect the drain. Before beginning work he confirmed the price we were quoted over the phone. He worked efficiently and professionally. We had an excellent experience with Ramiro and with dutton plumbing. Very professional.< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//Gmap_id><Text>Called Dutton Plumbing (Simi Valley) for a sewer main clog. Dutton cleared clog but but their lead plumber, Sean Goldate, said I needed sewer main replaced $14,000+. Next, Sean from Dutton said he found a bathroom tub leak and he would have to rip-out the vanity and wall to get to it, he wanted $4,000 to fix this. DUTTON TOTAL WAS $18,000 TOTAL. Got a second opinion form Jim Beck Plumbing. FOUND OUT SEAN FROM DUTTON LIED ABOUT THE SEWER MAIN - MY MAIN WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION (PVC MAIN). JIM BECK ALSO FIXED THE LEAKY BATHROOM TUB. JIM'S ENTIRE BILL TO ME WAS ONLY $150. Dutton Plumbing of Simi Valley (owned by Eric Dutton) RUNS A VERY UNETHICAL OPERATION. Dutton plumbers are cheats and liars.

<review>I had a leak inside my bathroom wall. That particular problem had happened before and had been repaired by Dutton. Unfortunately i was just out of warrenty. The plumbing tech Brett P. arrived within his appointment window.After a little conversation Brett realized I had used Dutton for other repairs (new water heater, outdoor pressure valve, clogged drain, shower leak) Brett/Plummer called his field supervisor and got permission to honor our exp warent. I had not told Brett, I was thinking of switching service as Dutton can be pricey. Brett came in kept our house clean, was clean and personable himself. he  broke through the wall, repaired our leak and and cleaned. the he did was neat clean and done right. Brett if you read this thank you. Your work and presentation has kep me a Dutton customer. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

<text>My Mom called Dutton Plumbing because she had a clogged drain and by the end of the day, she had a $11,500 bill to pay.  She never got an estimate, nor was she told what Dutton Plumbing needed to repair.  She was bullied into paying the bill and she had to call them back the next day because her drains were still clogged.  My Mom is almost 80 years old and she was treated terribly.  Do not ever call Dutton Plumbing!!!<//text><username>Lisa Derkos</username><Time>1511124244298</Time>< pictures>

Called Dutton office at 7:00 AM, they said someone would be there between 9-11, no problem, then got call saying they would be there in 30 mins, they showed up almost 45 mins, again no problem.

The plumbing problem was a broken PVC pipe in the Meter box, easy to get to.  Well my Father was a plumber and I spent many years helping, so I know whats involved, this is a 15 minute, job 20 if you run into roots.  The guys showed up from Dutton in a nice new van, in pristine white shirts, carrying what looks like a doctors bag. I tried not to laugh out loud, wondering if they realized they were plumbers not doctors.  I told them they would not need all that its a simple pipe repair.   They then took about 10 mins to write up a estimate which was $816.00, but he was very proud that he was able to save me $134.00 and that's how he got it down to $816.00.  I told him he must be mistaken.  When he looked at me as if i was stupid I told him to take his fancy bag get back in his truck and get out of here.  That I am happy to pay a fair price but that was ridiculous and that I hope they don't rip everyone off in the same manner.

BTW Gordan Taylor Plumbing came out right away did the job in about 15 mins.  and I had him tend to a few other issues I had been meaning to fix like my R/O filter system under my sink, check my pressure regulator, test the pressure on the house, check a gas line to my fire pit. WOW I am sure when Dutton would add these other items I would have to take a loan out on the house to pay their bill.  BTW Gordon Taylor Plumbing did the whole job for under $200.00.

The odd thing is the guy from Dutton did not even seem surprised at my response I guess he hears it often.  I never got a call back trying to explain or appologize.  I realize companies are allowed to charge what they like, but at rates like that I am fearful for the people who don't know any better.  I had heard of a senior citizen who had them change a water heater for nearly $3,000.00 and I dismissed it as urban legend as that was just crazy pricing and who would pay such an amount, but now i must wonder if this was a myth.  I have been told their Plumbers work on a commissions.

I have used Dutton before and they were expensive, but this time they were crazy.  They have lost my business and have earned a special place as I will tell everyone of my experiences.  I wonder how many people they actually take advantage of like this.<//Text>

I called in the morning for a leaky faucet repair and a garbage disposal replacement, a fair amount of business for one service call.  I was told it would be no problem to get someone out by 2:00 or 3:00.  I chose 3:00.  At 3:15, the office called and told me it would be a little longer, but they'd be here by 4:00.  At 4:20 they called and said it was going to be impossible to get some out today, but they would be happy to put on tomorrow's schedule.  I waited all day, cleaning up a leaky kitchen faucet, to be told they weren't coming.  Not good, Mr. Dutton!  They seemed "disappointed" that I was going to all another company,  Wow.</Text>

<Text>We had a major water heater failure this morning so I searched the web for a firm to replace the failed one ASAP; Dutton Plumbing popped up first. I called and described the problem; Dutton promised to help ASAP and would call back soon. They did both and two techs arrived sooner than expected. They diagnosed the problem quickly, described options and immediately ordered a replacement. The new water heater was delivered within ninety minutes and in the meantime the Dutton techs removed the old one and prepared to receive and install the replacement. The whole job was done as rapidly as I could reasonably expect. The techs were professional and competent. We're pleased.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1468340083439, 'text': 'Thanks, James! It was our pleasure serving you.

They are a complete rip-off. Brought them in to fix a small leak on an exposed copper pipe. They replaced 9” and charged $510.00. Later on, they offered a no charge inspection of my sewer system. They came with an estimate of over $7000.00. When I asked for a complete report as to what is wrong with the current system supported by photos, they started to give me the round around. I will never use or recommend them. As evidence of the excessive profit, they make on people, They FDEX me a very expensive box of chocolate chip cookies. I rather be treated fairly then get cookies from them.<//review>

Not good. I asked for a water heater replacement under Mfg warranty, they offered me $1 water heater replacement under warranty with $2000 Labor cost. I asked them to give me water heater and I can do the installation myself, they put me on hold for two days and was told later, Water heater warranty expired because house ownership changed. What a joke !!!</review>
