Love having AAA. What ever I need to do in the DMV I can go to the AAA and get it done there in the fraction of the time! Even during this pandemic there is hardly a line to get in. I was there yesterday to register my 1980 Toyota Corolla and waited a total of 5 seconds before being seen by a agent. The transaction itself took a mere 5 minutes. 👍👍👍< /review>

And even right now with this Covid 19 going on, its better to come here since random DMVs are closed. The staff was super helpful and the line was short. Just be aware that as of June 20th,2020 there is only 1 person allowed inside per transaction. So if you're coming with family or friends, they most likely won't be allowed to tag along. Other than that this AAA location is great.</Text>< Response>

Went in the afternoon on a weekday. In and out was fast (~20 mins) for getting a international drivers permit. Filled out the forms online prior to arrival. Also, payable with credit card for getting the permit. Lastly, remember to bring 2 passport photos too. Location does take passport photos if needed.</text>

Never have I ever received such horrible service! I had called triple A because I locked my keys inside my vehicle. I called at 1:26 pm and the  dispatcher alerted me the eta was 2:22pm. Soon afterwards I receive a text message from the technician saying he will arrive at at 3:07 pm or sooner .... at 2:55 pm he messages me informing me he will be herencia in 20 minutes... which is after the second eta I was given. This is ridiculous! Unprofessional, will be canceling my membership with them.</Text>

Waited 1 hour to pay for title transfer, had to get it smogged. I come back and had to wait another hour in order to pay registration. They stated I couldn't pay them online, because I started the process with them.
Downey AAA has better customer service and faster services.< /text>< GmapID>

Was told by Agent Sergio that Saturday's are not recommended to come in so I can add my vehicle over the phone and I do as he said. Turns out I still have to come in to take photos which he never mention to me in the first place and now waiting time is over an hour. Should have just came for everything in the beginning instead of wasting time on the phone only to come back and wait over an hour. I am definitely switching after my year is up. Horrible service! They Sure live up to their horrible customer service!<//Text>

I checked in and never got called. I was finally asked what type of service I was there for. It was DMV which took less than five minutes. I waited over an hour , watching employees interact more with each other rather than provide customer services. I left AAA office at 5:35.<//text>

I have very bad experience and memory with this office.  I had to come back 3 times  Wednesday  Thuraday and Friday to get auto transfer and registration due to lack of empathy and no customer service . The staff treat us like nobody eventhough I am being 10 years as paying  member of AAA. I eve have my house insurance with AAA FOR 3 years .<//Review>

<text>This place needs management to re-train workers. No way is this office AAA customer service.  I come for 1 ticket to Knotts berry farm and have been waiting for 30 minutes. I also prepaid my registration and was asked to smog my vehicle, when I return to complete my paperwork an untrained person asked to return because she has no clue why I'm being charged additional fees.

< review>
Go early in the morning because if you go after 12pm it gets extremely packed and for some reason they frequently have DMV system outages which cause all sorts of drama for the people waiting to be next in line.  On more than one occasion I've seen employees go out to lunch in the middle of  a heavy rush with no none to back up their shifts, which can be very frustrating for the customers waiting in line!< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It cannot be possible that they do not accept a debit card. If they have the visa logo on the door. Very bad experience thanks to that I had to pay surcharges for my plates😡

Drove an hour and a half to look at a pop up ended liking a used hybrid. After putting down a deposit we were told the financing "guy" would call us within 7 days. Made me very uncomfortable leaving not knowing how this would turn out. It is day 7 no word. I called to inquire and the fellow on the phone couldn't have been more rude. Told me to be more patient and my turn will come when it's my turn. He stated due to COVID it's crazy. That the bank is slow and they are too busy. Funny how this is not the first place we have been to and everywhere else was willing to complete the WHOLE process that day. This whole COVID excuse does not fly with me as banks have never closed, work from home and are always available. This is a shortage in staff I assume. No we are not purchasing an expensive RV which maybe would have pushed us up on the list from his tone.. The only reason I will continue with the process is because our salesman Devon was very polite and informative and we love the little used camper. Writing this because no business busy or not should talk to a buying/ PATIENT customer in this manner.<//review>

<Text>Our sales associate Jay and all the office staff at Lemke RV are awesome! They are low-key and not high pressure sales there. We popped in on Mother's Day weekend to see the RV we wanted. It was low miles (6k), relatively new (2019) and in perfect condition. We paid a deposit to hold it, bought it in cash a week later and we are taking our two teen daughters on a trip to Oceanside for Memorial Day weekend. What an easy, pleasant buying experience!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2JLWkIZK31RMKIcUHKFLXzw1BLMCqpFJzULqG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

5 stars! Unbelievable service from this family owned business. I picked up a used RV here (no warranty) and drove all the way back down to SD with it. Started having problems with the slide out in the first few days and figured it was my problem now, but hit them up just in case they could help

Because I was so far away and couldn’t bring it back they got me a mobile repair guy and sent me a check for the repair. They didn’t have to do any of that, but they really bent over backwards just to conduct good business and make sure I was happy. Blown away. Highly recommend Lemke RV!< /Text>

Jay took care of us from the start. He was very informative and a no pressure salesman. We were able to put a reservation on the trailer we wanted totally risk free and came back the next day to make sure we really wanted to buy it. Jay and Lemke made the entire process fast and easy. Thank you for the great experience!<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><date>1599508102051< /date><review>Very unprofessional!!
Felt like I was imposing on salesman, always seem to be in a rush which resulted in several mistakes upon purchase of trailer. Excessive price on PDI. My pick up appointment was at 2:00pm, had to wait till 2:30 for the presenter to finish lunch. Was supposed to have a 2 hour presentation on trailer, it took about 45 minutes. Presenter did not seem very confident or informed on the trailer operation. Had to ask two separate times for the trailer manual which consisted of a stack of papers that they had copied. Stove top was not cleaned, had trouble getting outside shower to work properly.
Biggest issue!! When they hooked up the trailer which needed a 2 5/8" ball, (my hitch had a 2" ball). They didn't say anything about it not being the right size. Fortunately, I was able to make it home without any incident and went out immediately to get the right size ball. Also failed to tighten battery cables.
Very disappointed, will not recommend to anyone.< /review>< name>

<Review>Do not buy from any dealership! You are getting ripped off. You will be spending thousands more then the rv is worth. Please think about it. You buy an rv and drive off the lot and will be upside down 25% more then you could sell it for in the best case scenario. Buy from a private party and actually get a good deal. These salesman’s are bad people who do not care what they are committing you too.< /Review><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

On 2-23-20, we put our motorhome in consignment at Lemke RV in Rocklin, CA. We agreed on a price. It was sold on 4-20-20. Lemke never told us they sold it. We only found out on their website are RV was not banked owned. They were very slow at paying us. We finally received a check on 5-18-20. In November  2020, we wanted to get another RV, so we looked at to there website and found a 2014 Coachman made an offer the RV asking price was $68,000 we offered $65,000. The salesperson said it was a fair offer, but his Boss said he would not come off $1.00, they made a hefty profit off are consignment if you are looking to buy Rv go elsewhere we did, we brought a 2020  Winnebago 33 ft Fully loaded only 4,000 miles 2,000 Watt inverter HWH Levers Plus Solar Panels 2 TV's plus a Spare Tire,  retail MSRP $122,000 we paid $73,000 the 2014 Coachman didn't have any tv in rear bedroom no inverter and no spare tire When we sat down with the salesperson before we made an offer, he said he would take another $1000 off the price I am glad we waited. We got a newer and better motorhome. I drove to Colfax and got a super deal. We give that dealership a 5 Star. They know how to treat their customers

<rating>5</rating><text>I recently bought and sold a M.H and 5th wheel from Mark at Lemke.RV.  This was my second dealing with the Lemke staff.   Both times i was treated respectfully and my sales and purchase went without a hitch.  Each consignment sale was made within a week. Each time for a fair price.  When I decided to buy a 2019 Winnebago  on the lot, Mark my sales rep walked me through the process, his knowledge of the winnebago was above average and what he didnt know he made a note and got me the information i was looking for. Ive been rving for 40 years, talked to alot of salespeople, alot of dealerships and for me Lemke and all their staff are way above average.  There was a small issue upon delivery with the interior but was immediately corrected by Phil the office manager.   All in all i would recommend  Lemke rv  to others.  I appreciated there low key non pressure approach.  THANKS AGAIN TO PHIL AND MARK.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Name>John R</Name>< Review>
Some of the used RVs had obvious damage. I'm talking several spots. People always seem to defer to somebody else as the person who can explain stuff. Not a good look. We might go back but I'm not really inclined. Nothing really against them but just did not get a good vibe. Either they don't check things thoroughly and miss a bunch of damage or they did check it out and they simply don't volunteer the information. That's not the way I would do it.<//Review>

I would personally encourage anyone looking for a fair and honest dealer of RV’s to go to Lemke RV in Rocklin.  Even with the increased limitations due to COVID 19, they managed to make us feel we were the most important couple there.  Phil,  the owner made the experience of purchasing our motorhome as exciting as possible and even did extra’s to make the wait worthwhile!  We truly felt excited and happy to have our Pleasure Way to drive home!  Micah and Donna Hartung</Text>

My fiance and I recently just bought our first camper from Lemke RV and we sure are glad we did! Andy was a huge help with our decision making and didn't make us feel pressured like some RV places can. Phil,  Dylan, and the rest of the staff on our pick up day were so awesome and answered all the questions we had. They even included a starter pack which was a nice touch! Very happy with our purchase!< /review>

<review>We bought a brand new Lance 650 truck camper from Lance it did not work for us so I listed it on Craigslist a few days later somebody from Lemke RV called us and said they would have no problem selling this brand new camper luckily I negotiated only leaving it there for 6 months because once they get possession of the camper they listed it for thousands more than you can buy a new one for at Lance I couldn't believe it of course it never sold even though I kept dropping my price six months later I returned to Lemke RV to pick up my camper of course the battery was completely dead even though it had a solar panel on the roof and the inside of this brand new Lance 650 was completely Dusty and full of leaves and debris that blew around there lot I brought it home and had to detail the camper it took me two weeks to sell it on Craigslist so be careful when somebody calls you from Lemke and promising you they can sell your RV then adding thousands of dollars to what your price and then adding tax on top of that.. yeah yeah yeah they have a nice lot and they are well spoken and seemed very friendly but don't let that fool you your RV could stay there for months..... I do not like doing reviews like this but itit's my duty to let the community know what could happen once you sign the contract with Lemke RV    again I'm sorry for leaving such a bad review but it's a true story don't let this happen to you...

Here are a few things I've learned buying RVs
If you buy a truck camper remember you got to climb a flight of stairs to get in and it's hard on dogs 2
If you buy a travel trailer make sure it has two axles 1 axle it's not enough and your travel trailer will bounce and toss your belongings all over not to mention 1 axle is not enough for the weight after it's loaded
If you buy a motorhome or something with a motor remember they sit for a while you will spend lots of money on the motor transmission the exhaust the tires the shocks alternator radiator and a whole lot more that comes with a coach with a motor
I believe the best way to camp is worth a small 20 foot travel trailer with two axles when you're not using it your motors not rotting transmissions not rotting the exhaust is not rusting the starter is not freezing up and the alternator is not going bad
And whatever you do do not buy a Lance camper
Best campers or Winnebago and Jay flight and if you can afford it airstream
Happy camping</review>< pictures>

{'time': 1591929066953, 'text': "Hello Paul, Thank you for the opportunity to sell your RV. We sell over 95%+ of our consignments and some sell the first day they arrive and some take longer. Sorry we could not get it sold for you. After detailing it several times, advertising and storing it for months without charging you anything definitely was not the out come we are use to or hoping for and cost us to try. But after selling a couple thousand consignments over the last 8 years there is a some we just couldn't move. I think it was because there were some new dealers that had sales that we could not compete with no matter how hard we tried and we did try hard. Thanks again for the opportunity! Sincerely, Erik Lemke"}</Response>

<review>This place is great for buying a trailer. We are very undecided as to what we want. The sales guys were very nice, accommodating and professional. They allowed us to look at every trailer three times and were great with our kids running all over. Will definitely be back once we are ready to buy. Oh and the sales guys are not pushy trying to get a sale.< /review>< pictures>

Visited this dealer after reading great reviews on line.  Units were open and we were allowed to browse on our own.  Most units were dirty and a couple smelled horribly of mildew.  Can't believe Lemke would think these units are show ready.  Really turned us off.  Won't go back.<//Text>

We worked with Jay over at Lemke and had a really great experience.  We walked through the unit we were interested in.  If there was anything that needed to be addressed Lemke got it taken care of. They helped negotiate a reasonable price and had great financing company available.  They even helped us streamline the process and rushed the processing because we were trying to be ready for an upcoming holiday.  Lemke was fantastic.  I will absolutely recommend them to my friends and use them if we decide to move into another unit.  I Highly Recommend!<//review>

We were looking for a used trailer in the $15,000 range. Looked up their website and came in. Jay went over the top to find a perfect trailer. Their customer service is second to none. Their trailer prep to make sure everything on our used trailer was in the best condition and safe for travel... look here first!</Review>

< review>
My husband and I bought a used RV here and the experience was very positive.  They listened to whart we wanted and only showed us this type.  They were willing to work with us on the price.  After the purchase they cleaned the RV and made sure everything was in working order before we picked up.< /review>

Had great service and a decent deal on motorhome I bought. Only thing is getting a title in California stinks, 30 to 60 days. I'm from Nebraska and here it takes 1 or 2 days.< /Review>

Just as there is no "perfect Used Car" lot, nor is there a "perfect RV/Travel Trailer" dealer. That being said,  I didn't know what to expect when I drove out to Lemke RV over the President's Day Weekend. I met some nice people and learned that the goal of the business is to make each customer feel welcome and at home, not like a target. I didn't find what I was looking or at Lemke, so what did Lemke do? Phil Cooper sent me across the street to Bill Ead's RV where I found what I was looking for. Thanks to Phil Cooper, and the rest of the staff at Lemke RV for helping me. My recommendation is to go to Lemke RV first.</text>

When all others were unwilling to help, the staff at Lemke RV in Rocklin Ca, came through. We were able to sell our RV in a timely manner, and couldn't be happier with the result. Would highly recommend them for any further needs.</text>

< Review>
We were at the diner today.
We waited awhile to be seated.
We noticed many clean empty tables.
We got seated.
We waited 30 minutes before Black Beard the waiter he would not tell us his name. My wife expecting to a sorry we are very busy but we are busy get over it. He also we could leave if we want. Then he left again.
We think he may wet himself because he sent someone else to wait on us.
My wife said isn't the customer always right.
Ouch!
We did eat and the food was good.< /Review>

The value of portion size to cost is just unreal. The plates are about the size of a small canoe, and they are always literally overflowing with food. The bacon cheeseburger is excellent, as is the club sandwich; but the real gold is the breakfast menu. The pancakes are huge and fluffy, and the chicken-fried steak is glorious. If you get home fries, ask for them deep fried, they're amazing.</review>

This place is awesome. I always see off the highway and decided to bring my wife in for anniversary dinner. She's a simple gal and we enjoy different stuff. We were extremely satisfied with the friendly service and the great tasting food. We had a sandwich and burger and a couple of milkshakes. Everything was amazing. We will be coming back.<//text>

< review>
Get one thing and split it! One time, a single breakfast omelette lasted for 3 meals that day and breakfast the next morning.
Once you get over the fact that there is more fat in that single plate than you will need for the rest of the year, it's all good. But it does feel unnecessarily greasy and if you're used to eating healthy, you will feel the consequences. But if you were really into the healthy thing, you would never come here. The service is great and food comes surprisingly fast.</review>

Huge portion sizes.  Food was good and wait staff was friendly.  Some quality in taste and flavor is lost when you have such large portion sizes though.   Quantity does not necessarily mean best quality.<//Text>

Positive:  Enormous delicious platters of food.  Great service too😜  Negative:  Extreme long waiting time to be seated😯   I couldn't figure out why we weren't  seated when clearly there was  atleast 3 areas that would seat my party.  😣< /Review>

They must have been short staffed.  Waitress took it out on our table and people next to us.  Never had such horrible service.  My husband had to ask for water menus

<text>Their service is terrible waited over 30 minutes to get an overpriced orange juice that was nearly 4 oz tall. The waitress kept walking past our area and never contacted us again.

Rib eye steak for dinner last night was very good. Back this morning for breakfast and chili cheese omelette. Prices are on the high side but you pay for what you get because portions are huge!  Good for splitting a meal.< /text>

There was only one other patron when we got there at dinner time.  I realized why when I looked at their menu prices. This is not a 4-star restaurant, it's a coffee shop. A meatloaf dinner was 21 dollars,  a burger.. 16.00.  I was disgusted and wanted to leave but my husband had already ordered coffee. Will never go there again.</review>

Paid $40 for two chicken sandwiches and kids chicken nuggets. Sounds good, until I got back, And they forgot my 4 year olds chicken nuggets. (Never forget the kids food) then come to find out they weren't even charged! So I really paid $40 for 2 chicken sandwiches! Really? A truck stop diner?</review>

The food was horrid. My country fried steak was soggy and the potatoes were undercooked. They didn't inform me they were out of biscuits until my order was out. My wife order a burger and the bun was stale and the meat had a sour taste. This is not the same Margie's we remember when we lived here. The only reason we gave it two stars is because the waitress was nice and friendly. We use to eat here one to two times a week when we lived in slo but I doubt we would ever eat there again the next time we are in town.<//text>

The menu looked really promising, but on delivery, the quality of the food was just average. If a restaurant pays that much attention to the detail on their menu, they should at least give equal attention to the flavor and quality of their food.< /review>

I can live with a food item not being up to par with expectations but the service was so bad that it's not worth giving this place another shot.<//review></record>

I got the pancakes there, and they were just average pancakes.  My friend got the french toast and that was very good.  So I guess its kind of hit or miss.</Text>

<Review>Food and service are decent. Very expensive. The place smells like an old folks home that hasn't been cleaned in several years. I felt a like I needed to put the clothes I was wearing in the laundry as soon as I left.<//Review>< name>

(Translated by Google) The food is very good and abundant, we were there in August 2009 and I recommend sharing the dishes since they are VERY abundant, 100% recommended. The garzones (camereros) speak Spanish and are very friendly.

Since 1956, The Bakersfield Museum of Art has been showcasing fine art and is said to be one of the city’s top attractions.

Inside this large museum are two large galleries and two smaller ones. The permanent collection features art by local artists. The rest of the rotating exhibits feature a mix of art from all over.

The outside grounds of the museum are home to some beautiful gardens and sculptures.<//text>

We have been closed to the public for several months, we don't have ocean animals on exhibit since we're an art museum, and there is no park called Golden Gate Park near us."}<//Response>

Wonderful museum. I was actually shocked at how nice it was. I wasn't expecting much because I was judging it based on that it's in Bakersfield. So sorry I judged and so happy we came< /text>

The exhibits are great and educational for kids. We went to the rainforest and to the gem and skin exhibits which were a great learning experience. I honestly was impressed the most by the beautiful butterflies.</Review>

I love this place but was disappointed the Rain Forest exhibit was closed. My favorite part was simulated flying like a pterosaur - the new name for pterodactyls. Lots of fun. Scientists have learned a lot about them since I went to school. Also enjoyed displays about evolution of the earth's crust and the beautiful gift shop. Prices in the cafe are a bit expensive tho. Still worth a visit!</Text>

Visited with my daughter and her fiancé as a possible venue for their wedding. The museum is beautiful; the grounds were also very beautiful, very green and well maintained overall. But the gazebo needs a little bit of a refurbishing and paint, and apparently there was a mishap with a prior landscaper where some bushes and vines were affected. But they are coming back nicely. Would have been a great wedding venue, only the time frame was off for us.</review>

No problem  with the museum's
HOWEVER
I Purchased a family   membership and was told I could bring my 5 list grandchildren who where written on the card by the worker who sold the membership  to me.
When I brought my  5 grandchildren to the Laurie Brock museum  on 8-1-18 I was told only 2 of them were allowed at one time....
Fraud
The reason I purchased the membership  was so I could have time with all of the cousins together.  I asked about it at time of purchase and was told, no problem, just show the card.  Lies...
Very disappointing.
8-1-18
Just asked to speak with a supervisor
I was informed that 2 adults and 6 children  are  allowed and the girl at admissions  made a mistake.</text>

We stopped without any expectations as we were passing through-just wanted to see what art was happening in Bakersfield.  Wow, were we blown away by the great art and curation.  A nice mix of local and international artists.  The different exhibits meant there was something for every taste.  You can easily spend a couple hours and come away refreshed!< /review>

I'll be very honest,I love the artwork but I don't ever want to go back there to visit due to an employee,Juana Martinez,who continuously takes photos of me without permission and doesn't care whether you like it or not . She seems to  be more on her personal cell phone taking sneaky pictures of people than doing her job .I don't mean to talk down about her ,only her actions and that is why I can't go there to support the museum.<//Review>

Fantastic service! I needed air in my tires. Every time I go to the gas station to do it myself, I either lose my money or the pump doesn't work. I drove in and asked if they could fill my tires and with out hesitating they said yes. We realized there was a nail in my tire, so they fixed it for me right away. Only charged for patching the tire. Great service.</Text>

Had lots of fun! The food was good, the sangria was spot on and the live music was beautiful. Was nice to "learn" how to dance, the teacher was very charismatic!<//text>

<date>1436499170313< /date><rating>1< /rating><Text>Not worth a penny . Went to celebrate the 16 birthday of my daughters best friend who is passionate for  Spanish culture and was getting ready for a trip abroad. We ordered our food at 9.01 pm , food was brought at 10 pm. Reheated with no seasoning or flavor whatsoever. The servers tried hard to be nice but the place is just disappointing.Bathrooms could be cleaner and in better repair, they look and smell horrible. Owners should put some of the profit on making a better place. Not coming back . Not recommending this place either.< /Text>< pics>

We came for my husband and our friend's Birthday... Our entire group wasn't here so we waited at the bar for a while. Once everyone Arrived we notified the manager and he said that he would get us seated right away! 20+ min. At the bar and no contact with us. I had to grab another hostess to get our group seated ( at a table that had been ready since we arrived an hr prior)
Food was great! Server, very sweet. However when the Salsa dancing started, we were asked to give $5 per man for lessons. I, nor my friends could find that there would be a charge for lessons. $5 isn't a lot, but it was the principle... When I asked about the "Red Ticket" that was needed to get free lessons, the manager told us it was listed on the website... I couldn't find it on what was provided via phone "Website"
Overall, fun environment, great flamenco show, and once those salsa dancers started the place came alive.... But HORRIBLE customer service by management, super rude and unapologetic.  We spent over $400 on food and drinks while there.  A little more graciousness would have been nice... Especially for a place which only rates  an average of 3 stars on Yelp! Fun place , BAD management!!!!</text>

<text>The website hours and actual hours are not correct. It is not open when they say and they do not answer phone calls. It's a good place for salsa but note salsa is now on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and the restaurant is not open on Tuesday. I finally got to go for salsa and the place is very good for salsa and the food is great. The service however is not that great.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcde583a012937:0xb9b9aa86fe274e09<//Gmap_id></record>

Went to celebrate a friends birthday. I expected good food so we had dinner there. Ordered the house Paella for 2. The order was huge big enough for 4. It was under seasoned and could barely find any meats; we got a big plate of rice that I could have made at home from a box. The owner or manager Rodrigo was extremely rude. I will not complain too much because the servers were GREAT with us.  The music environment is the ONLY!!!!! Thing this place has going for it. Expect to pay $10 to get in and $5.00 for twenty minutes of salsa lessons. I would not come back. Theres better places in Long Beach.</Text>

Haven't had the food in a long time but remember it wasn't particularly great.

However, this place is great for coming in and sharing your passion for Latin dance. Great crowd, and music.<//Review>

We came her in a large group and service was horrible. They took for ever to serve us. Didn't even bring us water until we had been here for a long time. Food took one and half hours to serve. I had Paella and it was salty and tasted bad. The server was rude and was always unhelpful. They took so long in bringing our food that we didn't even get to participate in the salsa dance lessons they gave since we had just gotten our food. It was suppost to be a nice celebration and they ruined our night. I would have given them less stars if it was possible.<//Text>

<text>Dry, cold food. Entertainment was mediocre. Nothing special at all.. Pork chop was extremely dry. It was like eating hard tasteless jerky. Sangria was just simply kindergarten punch. No alcohol at all. Before, and during entertainment was pretty empty. After the show (when people are allowed on the dance floor ~ 9:30ish) was when people started showing up for the nightclub part of it. Paella, which is a simple rice dish was the only decent thing. Would not return and definitely would not recommend.<//text>< Name>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>First Time at Tapas....BAD BAD Food, Sangria was the worse I have ever had...it just tasted like rotten punch and no wine or alcohol in it.....Bad experience and Bad treatment from management: at the time of Salsa teaching, they were asking for $5 per person if want to participate....Ok so my friend just stood up by our table where we had dinner and the manager came up to us  (short brown man)  and told her to seat down or else she has to pay....he repeated in a rude manner he  was going to charge her, she responded "I don't want to participate I just want to watch"
then he was even more rude to say if you don't seat down you will be kick out of here!!, we were very upset how we were treated after we had dinner and drinks it amounted well over $100.
We will not return nor recommend to any body to go there. Its embarrassing for this establishment to call it "Tapas" its a Spanish Restaurant where every body should be nice and friendly...<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Run, do not!! Eat here!  Horrible service, ran out of food at 8pm on a Friday night and only 1/3 of my party got their food.  I made arrangements 2 weeks in advance.  Also, food received had a hair and was sub par, at best.<//Review>< pictures>

Terrible food.  Apparently this is a night club and not a restaurant.  Went there many times when i lived here 10 years ago.  Not the same...run down.  Reheated precooked bar snack food. This is clearly a bar and not a restaurant now days.  Too bad it used to be good in the day</review>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend it to anyone, it is dirty, cold food, tasteless, plastic dishes, until I found under the tablecloth that moved by how small it was, petrified chewing gum. I will never return.

<text>These guys are outstanding I came in when they weren't open yet but they still service my truck. I recently personally did my brakes calibers and rotors and could not bleed my brakes. So came in to have a brake fluid flush. The technician was good and informed of the whole process.

The team was fantastic. They were professional and courteous from the moment I walked in the door.  I didn’t have an appointment and they were able to immediately get my car back, estimated that it might take until the next day but were able to turn around my car with all the repairs day of. I received a call once it was completed and was able to pick my car back up that evening. Great customer service and fantastic work. I’d highly recommend them!< /text>

Great place I would definitely recommend for tires.
I would have given them five star review but I had to wait for a while when picking up my truck they only had one gentleman Alex at the front desk.

Who was answering multiple incoming calls, greeting customers, taking payments for services. He was great very knowledgeable courteous and kept his cool under pressure especially with the two customers who had a million questions and were bartering to lower the prices with out an appointment I booked my appointment over a week in advance to be able to drop off and pick up with time to get to work.

Alex definitely needed assistance at least answering phones I did hear a female voice in an office with dark glass finally answer a single call only after lines were going crazy and multiple customers in lobby.

Even with all that I would return in the feature for services location is convenient really close to my home.<//text>

I've been using Western Brake for years. They have put tires and brakes on all my cars and both my kid's cars. They always turn my car around same day and usually within an hour or two.  Their prices are competitive and their service is impeccable.  Most recently they repaired the left rear power window. I highly recommend Western Brake. I will be taking my car back to them again.<//review>

<review>My first time here, the service was Great! I appreciated the price and recommendations.  I went in for an oil change initially but almost faint...my 2 front tires was showing metal..I got a great deal..I felt like I was at the neighborhood mechanic...because of how comfortable I was waiting on my car..I will be going back for my rear tires and brakes..

I went back 2-3 weeks later in a nick of time so I did not have to replace my rotors..Service was quick and through while I waited...everyone there's nice professional and helpful!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

After bringing my car in for a dead battery, they replaced it and had me in and out within the hour. Not only are they honest, but genuinely care about me as a customer and I always trust them with my vehicle. Love this place!<//review>

<review>Service was solid and the staff was very professional. They gave me additional service recommendations, but did not pressure me to get the work done right then and there. I was given information pamphlets. They had to reschedule my appointment, and gave me discount of $10. They didn't have enough staff that day. Not the cheapest place, but good work.</review>< Pictures>

AAA picked me up...my alternator went out on the 5N freeway at rush hour. The tow truck took me to Western Brake and Tire later that evening. The Key drop box was easy. Tech called me the next morning and had my SUV ready by noon.< /review>

<Review>I was very happy with my service. I was told by another auto shop that I needed front and rear brakes as well as new rotors. My car only has 48k miles and was less then 3 years old. After going to Western I was told I only needed brakes and not the rotors. The cost was also half of what I was quoted at the other shop. They have earned my future business and I recommend them highly.</Review>< date>

I came out of work to find I had two, completely flat tires. I called AAA and needed my car towed somewhere. Lucky for me, I called Western. Alex found me the best tires, at the best price and even filled out the rebate paperwork for me. The service was extremely friendly, helpful and professional. I have definitely found my new tire service/brakes location for our vehicles. My car rides so smooth and quiet now!<//review>

< Review>
I found these guys when I first moved from Texas in 2016. I'm always worried when trying to find new service businesses, especially for my car, my vet, and doctors. But, I lucked out when I found Western Brake & Auto on the first try. They have been amazing. My previous car had many issues from oil leaks to alignment issues to a/c and heating issues and they were very fair in price and off the charts service. Everyone there is super friendly and able to tell me my car's issues in a language I can understand. Paul & Joe are like the cousins you can always rely on to help you through a tough spot. I highly recommend Western Blake & Auto. So much so, that when I moved from Anaheim to LA, I didn't hesitate to continue to make the drive down to Western Brake & Auto when I need service or repairs. They will continue to have my business for as long as I'm in Southern California.</Review>

I love Western Tire!! Many members of my family use them also.  They are efficient and trustworthy and have reasonable prices.  They never try to upsale you.  I drive 45 minutes to get my car serviced at Western Tires and it’s worth it!!<//text>

The price for the exact tires I wanted was $400 below Pepboys. The staff were respectfully kind and helpful. They called to let me know everything was going well and on schedule and called to let me know when the Jeep was ready to be picked up, two hours ahead of schedule. Our Jeep is like new and my wife and I could not be more pleased.
Thank you Western.< /text>

Same day turnaround on a battery that AAA didn’t have in stock. Great service for any auto needs tune-up, repair, and tires. The general manager of the shop, Joe, takes care of everything and has a good sense of humor. Recommended 10/10 for car maintenance.< /Review>

Weve been going to Western Tire and brake for years now. We know them well. I don’t think there’s anything on our trucks that they haven’t fixed. Perfectly btw. They are Clean, Welcoming, very professional and most important ... Very Knowledgeable! They’ve even fixed my dune buggy ❤️ I trust them. They really Care
Great Job Guys. You are Genuinely Appreciated!

Very professional group of people. Did exactly what they said they would do car was finished on time very happy they even offer to follow up the following week to be sure the air-conditioning is working properly. I highly recommend the shop I plan to use them for my 13 other cars that I have that need repair.<//text>

I found Western Brake and Tire on the AAA approved repair shops list. I took the SUV in for a creaking sound in the suspension. I told the service writer about the noise and he had their mechanic go with me for a test drive. The mechanic did a few maneuvers to test for the noise and he heard what I was describing. They did the repairs and it appears to have fixed the problem. I can’t remember the last time a mechanic test drove a car with me! Exceptional service! A pro shop. Neat and clean.</Review>

<text>My first visit. No nonsense. On time-on budget and friendly. I will definitely return.

My second visit. More of the same outstanding service. Honest, friendly and value pricing. I will
definitely return again.

My third visit and more of the same trusted services and support. Work continues to be provided as promised. I venture out of my area to know I’ll be taken care of with no-nonsense. I will definitely be back.< /text><GmapID>0x80dcd7b66d622d01:0xb2cfd5700ee67f85<//GmapID><Response>None< /Response>< user>

<text>I have my car serviced at Western Brake and Tire on a regular basis.  I either get an appointment or if they aren’t too busy will drop by to get my car serviced.  I get my usual oil change along with a vehicle inspection and tire rotation during the service.

Being a girl, the assumption is plan to get looted at a mechanic shop. However I was pleasantly surprised! I called on a Saturday an hour before closing and the gentleman who answered the phone explained there always is the chance they might have to order the lights, but they will try. My lucky day they had the bulbs an I was offered coffee while I waited. It wasn’t much of a wait it was done in five to ten minutes. I didn’t even have the chance to finish my coffee. They gave me the best early Christmas gift ever, SAFETY. A truly wonderful experience.
It’s good to know that there are such kind people out there.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
I was just ready to buy all four tires because I want the entire package when it comes to replacing tires. On a road trip I got a screw in my tire. Good Year patched it and I was off! Under $25.00. Why am I surprised I didn't need new tires? Because my very own dealership tried to sell me new tires before I left...with a medium to hard sell tactic. But I wasn't quite on board with the pitch. Listen to your instincts and know your cars ladies! ....and gents! These guys made my day and we're super cheerful and it was hot. You guys rock!!!< /Review>

I’ve been taking my car and my work vans to Joe for over 20 years. Bottom line is that they’re honest. I trust them and I know they’re going to get it done properly and for a fair price. If I don’t need it, they won’t sell it to me. I recommend them to everyone.<//Text>

<text>These guys were fantastic! Quick, clean, professional, and honest. I came in there expecting to pay close to 400 dollars but instead they were able to find the problem and I walked out only paying closer to 70 dollars. I will certainly  be going back for any future car troubles!</text>< Pictures>

Too expensive $30 for tire repair for a flat. I got it  repaired down the street for $20. Even after telling the person in charge I had $25 and showed him my bank account balance. It was an emergency and I am a lady i was alone. The man was rude and careless.<//Review>

<review>I work near this business so I started going here out of convenience about 6 years ago. I decided to keep going back because they won my confidence that they're honest. With 3 kids and 4 cars I've gotten tires and service here many times. I've also recommended them to friends and coworkers. Their prices are on par with the area - so not excessive but not rock bottom either. What they do offer is quality service that they back in the off chance there's a problem. And, they're friendly too.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I had 3 nails in my tire and they fixed it very nicely. The staff is very knowledgeable and they really care about their customers! The Customer is number One here!
I highly recommend this shop for all your Tire needs including brakes, Alignments and suspension work! They are the Best in Anaheim!</review>

Great customer service, second to none.  Fair prices, great work.  One thing to note, the bathroom is by far the cleanest of any  work facility I
have visited.   I would go back just to use the restroom.

A friend's car was making a noise. Thinking it was the brakes, drove over to have this shop check it out.  They took the tires off check and asked many times "Do you have a warranty or did you get the extended warranty?" They were so professional and helpful. The encouraged us to take the car over to Orange Ford. They did not charge a fee.  We are very impressed by their courtesy and friendly attitude.   I would recomend this shop to everyone.< /Text>

<Review>Came in,  no appointment,  really really in a hurry,  and they took super great care of me.  Alignment and 2 tires in time for me to get to my daughters dance class.  Great customer service on the phone and in person.  I wasn't going to change the tires, even though I needed them,  but guys this good and courteous deserve my business.

Got our Brakes done here needed rotors cleaned and pads replaced. tested the fix done by these guys and a loud squealing emitted from the front brakes.  When asked they said they just had to settle in, it was fine and it was normal.  We weren't totally sure but it was past closing time, and we lived over 2 hours away.  4 months later and they're kaput, and it's Going to cost us a 1800 to get it back to working condition. Needs new pads new rotors, leaking brake fluid and the calipers locked up on some of the wheels.< /Text>

My brakes went out. When I got to the shop I had to wait an hour to get a quote. The quote was $400+. I was told that the problem was my master cylinder, part came out to $170 and the $230 was labor. I priced the part on the high end at $90 and the part is only held on by 4 bolts. That plus bleeding the brakes doesn't come out to $230 worth of labor. I walked. I took my car to another mechanic and it turned out that my master cylinder was fine. The problem was a broken brake line.</Text>

Getting new tires for my PT Cruiser. Great prices, great customer service and they have a Kuerig coffee maker with all the flavors I never seen before. If your tires are balled, bring in the vehicle and they will take good care of you.<//Text>

<text>Thank you Joe and company. I was on vacation and ended up leaving these guys quite a present in the middle of the night. I was so worried I was going to get "raped". Small town country boy in big town city. I am pleased to say these boys really treated me well and were honest and fair. No raping here. Thank you so much. If i lived there I would be a customer for life.< /text><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7b66d622d01:0xb2cfd5700ee67f85</gmapID><Time>1507593583207</Time>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) They do not know about mechanics in this place, they think that the computer will solve the faults, they change expensive parts, they do not solve the problem and they do not give you a guarantee of the work👎👎👎

<text>I would highly recommend AME. They are organized and clean. The staff is very professional and respectful. The doctor that treated me was very kind and knowledgeable. The waiting room is comfortable with a TV and magazines. Patients must ring to doorbell to be let in for security purposes. Overall, a great place to go for urgent care needs.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2d1f485455a03:0x123ef86ac11f7fa7</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is by far my favorite urgent care! It’s always easy to make an appointment (through Solv) and check in. I’ve always brought my kids to this place, if they can’t be seen by their doctor or Saturdays. The doctors are always courteous and nice and are always helpful in easing a mother’s mind! I would highly recommend this place!</Review>

This urgent care always has appointments and are very upfront and straight-talking. After having suffered a car accident and being rejected by SEVERAL primary care physicians because they aren’t willing to give medical evidence in case I sue, I am happy that there was someone who was willing to help me because I needed it (whiplash, mild concussion). They get things done quickly and efficiently. Needless to say, I’ll be getting a new primary care physician, one who actually wants to see me healthy and not worry about a possible litigious nature.<//review>

Went in because my daughter woke up with a swollen eye, check in was super fast, and was seen by a doctor right away! I would definitely recommend!
P.S. I went in again for my other daughter, and again, they were super fast and efficient. I love the fact that you can schedule an appointment ahead of time with the Solv app!< /review>

<text>I really like this urgent care. I came twice for my son and this time it was for me. They have this new online check-in and appointment system Solv which is awesome. I never thought I would be able to make an appointment for an urgent care visit. I was seen shortly after my arrival and was treated by Nicky I believe was her name. She was able to identify my illness and prescribe me the meds to treat it. I will definitely be returning to this urgent care for both myself and family in the future.</text>< Pics>

It was around 8:30 am and there was a Girl cleaning the facility, She saw me and my son stand by the door and she didn't hesitate to open the door and kindly greet me and my son. She then proceeded to ask if  there was anything in specific that my son wanted to watch and went ahead and Put it on Netflix. I want to enforce how this nurse has excellent Customer service and how she has compassion towards patients.I asked for her name and she kindly said LonnieMarie Sir is there anything else i can help you with? I usually don't write reviews but i felt like this had to be known.  . Doctor got there by 9:25 was out in 10 minutes. I really recommend This urgent care to everyone excellent service by everyone. More people like this should work at these facilities. Thank You LonnieMarie and AME for making me and my son welcomed.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I have recently visited this location more than expected and I have to say the times I’ve came the waiting is really not too bad - of course, depending on how many people can be ahead of you.

Today’s visit could’ve been a long wait- 9 patients!  I mentioned to the receptionist LonnieMarie I had a pre-made appointment.  She  acknowledged the appointment I waited a little and was called in.  Soon after the visit I went to thank LonnieMarie.  Great Service all the way around!<//review>

Worst place ever!!! Young doctor needs more experience, took my 10 month old grandson in today she diagnosed him with allergies which was totally obvious he didnt have. She prescribed him allergy meds. We decided to take him in to E.R. as soon as we left this place. Turns out he has pneumonia, we definitely do NOT recommend this place.</text>

Villa Montanaro is a lovely community, clean, quiet with many amenities. Sierra answered all of my questions that I had and has been so amazing with the start of this process. I would highly recommend this community to anyone looking for a great apartment.< /review>< pics>

< review>
I have lived at Villa Montanaro twice (travelled in between) and this is, by far, the best community and apartment buildings in the area. The grounds are beautiful with lots of amenities and fantastic views from many of the units. But the best part is the management and maintenance team!

Sierra was incredibly helpful before, during and after my move! She is such a caring individual and effective and efficient about getting things done.

Jesse, too, has been so helpful and responsive doing repairs in my unit. He is very warm and takes even the smallest thing (like a little plastic pull for the blinds) seriously and handles the repairs quickly.

The property manager, Chris, is always looking for ways to improve the property and is responsive and friendly.

And Josephina, the cleaning person, is the absolute best! Her attention to detail is unmatched. These places are “white glove” clean!

Would highly recommend Villa!< /review>

Villa Montanaro is a beautiful community, the units are spacious, clean, and the residents, I had the pleasure of meeting, helpful and kind. From the moment I inquired about the possibility of living here, the response from the management team has been incredible. Rosalyn  patiently and knowledgeably answered all of my questions over the phone, and Sierra, whom I met with for a tour, was nothing short of phenomenal. All of my questions were answered, my special requests met and the individual care and concern I received extraordinary. For many reasons, I did not end up renting a unit here, but the decision did not come easily. I would recommend this community, and its management team, to anyone who is looking for a new place to live, and thank them for the excellent care and attention I received.< /review>

Moved in a month ago and the team at Villa has been nothing but helpful and amazing! Sierra made moving in so effortless. I’ve met a few of the neighbors and everyone is really nice and friendly. My favorite part is that everyone seems to have a dog around here, which helps in socializing my dog. I love that the complex is clean and very much enforce the COVID protocols. Any questions or concerns I may have (hardly any), Sierra and staff are sure to always help and address in a very timely manner.</Review>

While I didn't end up renting with Villa Montanaro, the experience I had was hands down one (if not THE) best I've had in 10+ years of renting. Sierra is SUCH a gem - not only was she extremely knowledgable about the unit, features, property/amenities, and area but she takes everything to the next level. Sierra responds extremely quickly to all inquiries, provides all information necessary to make an informed decision, and is overall a super friendly person! Not once throughout the process did I feel pressured to sign/rent with the building which really makes the experience so much better. THANK YOU SIERRA!!!!< /review>

There is a friendly leasing consultant, Sierra, and she gave us a perfect virtual tour and detailed information about the apartment. Her response speed is almost real-time.
It's been about a week since I moved in. It is very satisfied at the moment.  The parking space is spacious, the community is safe, and the neighbors are so good.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Beautiful community conveniently located right near the on-ramp to 680- surprisingly, you don’t hear much highway traffic. Resort like amenities, attentive maintenance personnel and accommodating, understanding management staff. Compared to the rest of the bay, you get a lot for your money here. The apartments are wel renovated and kept and people are generally friendly. Far less crime than the rest of Alameda county and there is a short walk to the PH BART. Highly recommend this community.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I LOVE living at Villa Montanaro. Chris and Sierra pulled off a herculean effort of a 2.5 week time to process my paperwork and prepare my unit so I could move in before starting my new job. Even with all of the social isolation during Covid I truly feel community from my A TEAM Chris, Sierra and Jesse. Sierra with her sweet personality is always helpful, thorough and prompt in her follow up to any questions I have. Jesse is a Jesse of all trades and can basically fix anything quickly and efficiently. Property manager Chris is also very accessible and caring about his complex and tenants. In addition to a top notch management team this complex is in a prime location. You can basically be anywhere in the bay within 15 to 30 minutes. This complex is beautiful and safe. I hope to be here for quite a few years.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I have lived at Villa Montanaro, Pleasant Hill, for almost 2-years now and I literally have zero complaints about this place. The building management and particularly Chris C., does an outstanding job keeping the grounds clean, responding timely to tenant’s inquiry’s, and keeping us all informed and up to date with changes or early office closures. The property also has an Amazon hub which hasn’t been the best for my savings but is super convenient nevertheless! This place also has prime location you are 10 min away from Bart, the grocery store, Wine warehouse, BestBuy, and so much more.<//Text>

We’ve lived here for two and half years, and honestly, our overall satisfaction to the apartment, management, and environment are the BEST in our experience - only reason of moving out is solely due to my work.

1. Apartment - still new, clean, good construction & design
Interior
- High Ceiling
- Hard Wood Floor (luxury color)
- Open Kitchen & moderate appliances
- Shower Windows (no more shower curtains!!)
- never stuck toilet (basically bathroom is gorgeous)
- Large Windows, Central Heating
- Excellent  Layout

Exterior & Other Environment
- Gated Apartments
- Not Gigantic Community
- Sophisticated Looking Building and Front Garden (we always like when we come back at night entering to the apartment inside space with water fountains and nice lightings)
-  5 mins walk to Iron Horse trail
- 5 mins drive to Heather Farm Park (Probably one of the best park in Walnut Creek area)
- 10 mins walk to Burt station.

2. Management
I think the management quality also contributed our best satisfaction.

Prompt email communication and excellent maintenance service.  There is an on-site friendly & responsible maintenance manager who is skilled, diligent,  flexible, and actually cares about residents.  He was very helpful when we emailed at some weekend evening to the office manager about our appliance, he came next day’s morning with a solution.  Also, when I ran into him and mentioned other little problem on hallway, he promptly came for us and fixed the problem in a second.  Never accepted tips we offered.

I am now fun of Windsor management and I often hear good reputation.

We feel safe, calm, and fun happy moment truly with our dog and plants in this community.  This is a good place to stay.<//text>

< review>
I lived at Villa Montanaro (one of Windsor’s properties) for ~1.5 years and cannot say enough good things about the property and staff. Chris and Sierra in the leasing office are absolutely incredible. Super easy to talk to, and I have genuinely enjoyed my interactions with both.  Jesse and Nick are amazing maintenance workers. They work their tails off, and are always willing to help out. The entire staff has a smile and a genuine urge to connect and help in any and all ways possible.  I only left to be closer to family on the other side of the country during these difficult times, but I hope to return back soon. Highly recommend Villa Montanaro to any looking for a great place to live, or even reaching out to Chris or Sierra for other Windsor properties.<//review>

We are from New York and she helped us with the virtual tour to answering any questions we had and we had many questions. Sierra was very communicative and responsive with everything. Even though we ended up moving to another complex, we had the best experience with Sierra. We needed an apartment earlier that we expected and unfortunately for us, the apartment in Villa Montanaro was not available on the date that we needed to move. I still wanted to write this review for Sierra because I was so impressed by how incredible and professional she is, Villa Montanaro is very lucky to have Sierra.</Review>< user_id>

The leasing agent, Sierra is amazing! My husband and I stopped here first for a tour and instantly fell in love with the facility, the employees and especially the cleanliness of the complex. We toured several other locations; however, none surpassed Villa Montanero. The staff is friendly, professional, caring and go above and beyond to make your move stress free.

I lived at Villa Montanaro for 2 years, and I’ve never been so sad to move out of a place. I would be living here for a 3rd year if it wasn’t for job relocation. Here’s my TL; DR review: the units and amenities are above average, and you get tremendous value for your money by living here.

PROS:
-Units are clean, have big windows that let in lots of light, and have floor plans that make good use of the square footage. To my knowledge, in-unit W/D, ice maker, small patio, and central heat and AC are standard.

-Well-insulated. We rarely turned on the heater during the winter. In the summertime, it can get warm on the top floors, but that’s what the AC is for!

-The staff here is great, especially Jesse on the maintenance team. One time when our fridge wasn’t working, he spent over an hour on the weekend fixing it.

-Amazon hub package lockers are amazing.

-Free, unassigned parking in the back lot is plentiful. Or you can pay extra for an assigned carport or space in the garage ($75/mo).

-Great location. Walking distance from BART and next to 680.

-There are luxury apartment buildings in the downtown Walnut Creek area that have nicer amenities (ex: Brio, Lyric), but they are also much more expensive. I feel like VM provided better value for your money.

-You will only hear BART if it’s a quiet night, and your windows are open. We had also looked at Avalon Walnut Creek and Walnut Ridge, which both had noise concerns.

-In the past 2 years, they have upgrades  like adding package lockers, re-painting the exterior of the complex, replacing the pool furniture, and renovating the clubhouse (not currently open due to COVID)

-Neighbors are friendly and respectful.

-We parked one car in the garage and one on the street/free parking lot and never had any issues w/ crime. However, I’ve seen a ton of smashed car windows at the end of the Coggins Dr closest to BART, where a lot of commuters park before jumping on BART. The section of Coggins in front of VM seems to be OK, but just keep in mind.

-Common areas and landscaping are well-maintained

CONS:
-They are owned by a larger company called Windsor, who increase the rent every year. For our 1 bedroom apt (946 sq. ft.), the rent was $2,665 the 1st year, $2,743 the 2nd year, and would’ve been $2,770 for a 3rd year. I wish that management had shown more of an effort to retain residents, but that being said, it’s not like rent increases are uncommon, and the increases aren’t outrageous. But comparatively, Park Regency kept my rent flat for 3 years.

Also when we were negotiating the rent for the 2nd year, one of the former leasing consultants tried to tell me how the new Avalon building down the street would increase rental prices in the area, which irked me. I felt like VM wanted to charge higher prices like Avalon, but Avalon’s amenities are nicer, and their building is brand new, so it’s not exactly apples to apples.

-The pricing on the website changes daily. If you have a lot of time before you need to move, I recommend checking the prices every day because I’ve seen the monthly rent on a unit change by like $200 over a 2 week period. And if you see a deal for “up to 1 month free,” call them and double check the deal for a specific unit. When moved in, they were giving 1 month free on 2 br apts but only $500 off 1 br’s.

-We had a top floor corner unit. On the side of the apartment next to the hallway, you can hear doors closing, people walking past, etc. The side of the apartment next to our neighbors was quieter, which made me wonder if they just skimped on the insulation on the hallway side. I loved how quiet our unit was, but things might be a little more noisy if you’re not on the top floor.

-Wish the gym was bigger.

-The paint and carpet in the hallways are outdated, but how much time do you really spend in the hallway? I’d rather have a nice apartment than nice hallways.</text>

I spent half the day looking for good quality office furniture within my budget.
Ronda greeted me with a cheerful and upbeat personality!
She educated me in depth about the different components and options for desks and chairs.
She didn't rush me and was not pushy, she was actually very helpful and gave me options that allowed me to get what I needed and wanted within my budget.
I'm so glad I stopped in.
This store has an amazing selection and the staff are all very friendly.< /text>

I had a great experience at Arenson Office Furniture yesterday that I'd like to share. I walked in looking for a conference room table for my office. I was greeted by a smiling Ronda Hale. She welcomed me to the store and pointed me in the right direction. After having a chance to look around at my own pace, I found the perfect table and we made a deal. Arenson will be my first stop for any furniture needs from now on. Ronda is the best!!</Text>

She then made several great recommendations with the floor plan, layout, and colors.

Don't understand why there's a sign right outside that indicates that all people inside MUST wear a mask when the employee who helped me wasn't even wearing one herself. Three customers came in right before I left also not wearing masks and she didn't say anything to them. Very disappointed.</review>

Really easy to work with and huge selection of office chairs.  The building is near Office Depot off Miramar srd and worth checking out.  We only needed 2 chairs and they gave us excellent service for such a small order.</Review>

<review>Great selection of office furniture, staff members are incredibly helpful and knowledgable.  Ronda especially was amazing to work with.  She used a CAD program to help us map out our office to the inch to make sure all our furniture would fit adequately.   Highly recommend going to arensens for all your office needs.</review><Response>{'time': 1475626333444, 'text': 'Matt we are so glad we had the opportunity to earn your respect and business, thank you.'}</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>They have good office furniture to fit all people, and it is customizable so that you end up with the perfect chair. The only downside is that it can take a couple of weeks to get your chair.< /Review>< Time>

<review>Working at my computer is a whole new and improved experience thanks to Arenson Office Furniture! Ronda offered her ergonomic advice generously, helping me to see not only did I have a bad chair, I was sitting in a way that was causing tension. We bought the Alera Elusion chair and it's the most comfortable office chair I've ever used! It's like I'm floating. Ronda's guidance about how to sit in the chair and also to have the keyboard below the computer has made a world of difference. I work with ease and comfort now! She never tried to sell us anything, just offered her caring guidance. It works out Arenson had the lowest price on the Elusion and it came with a free ergonomic lesson, thanks to Ronda. We will definitely be back to Arenson for any other office needs.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Ronda is an asset to us as well as our Clients and we look forward to being your go-to for any future office furniture needs. You know, Ergonomics are more important than most people realize and once they are able to experience the difference it can be life changing.\nKind Regards!'}<//Response>

<review>They have good office furniture to fit all people, and it is customizable so that you end up with the perfect chair. The only downside is that it can take a couple of weeks to get your chair.< /review>< rate>

<text>Working at my computer is a whole new and improved experience thanks to Arenson Office Furniture! Ronda offered her ergonomic advice generously, helping me to see not only did I have a bad chair, I was sitting in a way that was causing tension. We bought the Alera Elusion chair and it's the most comfortable office chair I've ever used! It's like I'm floating. Ronda's guidance about how to sit in the chair and also to have the keyboard below the computer has made a world of difference. I work with ease and comfort now! She never tried to sell us anything, just offered her caring guidance. It works out Arenson had the lowest price on the Elusion and it came with a free ergonomic lesson, thanks to Ronda. We will definitely be back to Arenson for any other office needs.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Bobby was a pleasure to deal with. He made the process simple since our phone call. Dropping off the car was simple and hassle free. He was also informative about what I needed to be done and all my options so I can make the right decision. He was also very communicative about the process and when the car was ready. I think because of him, I’ll be bring my Acura back to spreen Acura for service. I used to go to a competitor because of the trust factor. However, after today I know I have trust in Bobby at Spreen. People like him
are the reasons people feel safe and comfortable bringing in their cars.<//Review>< user>

I'm quite certain that I'm reiterating other customer's review on how great Spreen Acura treated them. The streak continues to my family's experience. My wife is due with our next baby and we wanted a bigger vehicle.

Jerimiah was sitting next to the front door (he should get his own office, to be honest) and greeted us on a warm Saturday afternoon. We wanted a used 2018 7-seater SUV and he gladly showed us their inventory. Many to choose from and we were indecisive on which trim we wanted.

After showing the used lot, he mentioned their last President Day Lease special on their 2020 lines with 0.9%APR. Needless to say, we walked away with a great offer on a new 2020 Acura MDX. Jerimiah wasn't pushy at all and just showed us the benefits of the special. Thank you Spreen Acura and Jerimiah for the great buying experience.</Text>

I had a dead battery in my car.  Was able to get a jump start and drove immediately to Spreen Acura.  Fortunately my battery was still under warranty.  In less than a half an hour, I had a new battery and was on my way.  Couldn't ask for better service.< /text>

I came to drop off my car to get it serviced, and the service has been fantastic.  The shuttle service took me to In-N-Out, and the waiting room is stocked with coffee, tea and water.  I also brought my laptop to get some work done while waiting for my car.  This dealership is a huge improvement over the former Acura dealership that operated down the street 10+ years ago.<//text>

Ordered from the Acura e-store. Waited a week to call, was told to wait longer. Called two weeks later and was told the part was discontinued. That’s fine, BUT NOBODY EVER CALLED TO LET ME KNOW!!!

<Review>WOW! Walking in here. Words can’t even describe. I walked into other dealerships previous to this one. The other places were so rude and made you feel so uncomfortable. This Acura dealership is far from that. They were all so nice and helpful, such full of knowledge my Sales rep. Her name was Natalie. Plus to me it was more comfortable because she was A woman just like me. She was so helpful. I came out with the best deal and vehicle. I can’t thank her enough. I highly recommend this dealership. It was a far drive for me it was so worth it!</Review><Time>1598716969928<//Time><UserId.>118308548934330974993<//UserId.>< Rate>

We were in the market for a used commuter with relatively low miles at a fair price. We received that and more with the Great customer service by everyone we talked with at Spreen Acura of Riverside in SoCal.. Most notably were the complete sales team and in particular Alan, Ryan and Omar whom we kept busy from the start to the very last detail of the car buying process. We kept Alan from his lunch break and he refused to let us buy him lunch or snacks.. Thank You All, your personalities and professionalism earned our respect for certain. See you all on our next vehicle purchase.<//text>

It's an old car that has required decent maintenance in the last few years. They are honest about the costs and have been transparent about what needed to be fixed, even going to so far to tour the car in the mechanic's shop. Oil changes, transmission, engine caps to address the check engine light are some of the things done. Wait time is still pretty long, but the lounge has snacks, coffee, outlets and there are periodical check-ins to let me know of the progress.

<review>First time I take my Acura for service at this location.  The service and attention provided  by technician was excellent.  However i give three stars only because the sensors were messed up with.  the same day my MDX was serviced, I noticed that  the lane assisted system  and the forward collision warnings lights are on.  I need to bring my car back  in, but if this is a continuous problem I will not take it back to Spreen  Acura again.   Sorry,  I like the service at my previous service dealer better.  I  always took my two Acuras there and never had any issues.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Did a great job getting me the car I wanted at a great price - beating all other dealers within a 100 mile radius.  Even delivered it to me.  Took care of all the paperwork for me over the phone and made it a very smooth transaction.

Make sure to ask for Dustin - He always treated me honestly and with respect.  I will definitely refer Dustin and the dealership to others.<//text>

Staff was exceptional in every way. Edmund and Ryan made the purchase extremely easy. We completed almost everything over the phone so when I arrived to sign it took about 10 minutes.< /review>

<name>Betzaida Flores</name><Text>Horrible communication and disorganized... if you have your own loan, forget it! They will make you pay for it!! They’re excuse for being slow as molasses is that their bank doesn’t know how to react to money outside of their loans. They have a three day waiting period! Plus, if you come at 9... you like the car and want to take it, no one from the financing department gets there until 11! So you’ll have to wait until then! We bought the car a Friday, processing took Sat, they don’t work Sunday. They didn’t receive the funds until Monday which still took another day to see it in their bank, Tuesday comes, get here at 9 (WHEN THEY OPEN) and no one was available until 10... “printing papers “ took an hr and still had to get approved by the financing manager who got here at 10:30 ( because we rushed him)! Smiles and apologies don’t matter if your process takes for ever!<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Love this place - I go here for my oil changes and I can always expect top notch service! I've been helped by Mat, Phil, and all the rest in all the times I've been here and they've always treated my incredibly well. One thing I'm sad about is that since the company switched management, they no longer offer the Hendrick oil change package which was a huge plus.

But in terms of service, I always trust the guys here at Spreen!< /Review>

I truly appreciate the friendliness and the service I always get at Spreen Acura. I feel welcomed, and important. I get accurate recommendations for what is needed, but never any pressure to do it that day, unless I desire to. This is a place that I have grown to trust very much. I highly recommend Spreen Acura.< /Review>

I had a great experience leasing a car at Spreen. Edmund Delucas was so knowledgeable and professional. He has a lot of product knowledge and was not pushy or pretentious. I see myself staying with Spreen for future leases or purchases. I will be recommending them to my family and friends.< /review>

I was working with Edmund who was wonderful! He was so professional, dealing with him was actually a good experience. During our negotiation I kept asking for the price for the vehicle I wanted to purchase without an alarm system added and without the extended warranty. Each time he went to his manager  he would not give him the numbers. After some time his manager (who I believe his name was Ryan) came out and was so rude and unprofessional, I was shocked. After he introduced himself he said "I'm done hackling. We've been going back and forth with you for hours and I'm done so this is what it is the alarm is not coming off of the car. If you don't want to buy the extended warranty that's up to you but I wouldn't buy a car with over 62,000 miles and no warranty." I tried to explain to him that I was physically shown how the vehicle did not have the alarm installed and would not want to purchase the alarm but he wouldn't allow me to finish instead he cut me off and said "this isn't coming off...this isn't going to change...you either realize this is it and take the offer or we're done" by this time I was done as well, done with his unprofessionalism, and done with his eye rolling. I said thank you for your time we will be leaving. Before leaving I wanted to reiterate how professional and helpful Edmund was but he just walked away. When he  was walking away he yells over his shoulder "well that's good too bad your losing a good deal over $500". I was shocked. This is unacceptable behavior, not because he is a manager but because he is supposed to be a professional. This is not the type of environment I expected to encounter when I made the hour long drive with my two young children. This was a very disappointing experience to have to deal with this type of behavior.</review>

Normally the process of buying a car is something I dread.  However, the staff at Spreen Acura made this the easiest purchase I’ve ever made.  My salesperson Devon was incredible.  Absolutely zero pressure, very helpful in finding exactly what I wanted and she went the extra mile in getting the TLX detailed and looking great.  Omar in finance was awesome and again, zero pressure.  He was quick at finishing the paperwork and helpful in securing the best interest rate.  I highly recommend this dealership and would definitely come back again.</Review>

If Acura ever wanted a dealership on which to model the ideal service department, they should come to Acura of Riverside and deal with John. My parents have bought Acuras here over the years and my Mother continues to get her Acura serviced here. Why do I rate them so high?

Because they care and have a soul. My Father passed some years ago. As my Mother is older, she's also dying from an aggressive form of cancer. What does all of this have to do with John in the Service Department?

He's ALWAYS looked out for her. He's been honest. His integrity is unparalleled. He's advised her honestly on recommended service. Acura of Riverside has always been honest and above board in all dealings with her.

Also, their superior service is why her Acura still drives like it's brand new.

I can't say enough good things about this dealership, their Service Department and their Parts Department.< /text>

<review>Be careful of this dealer when you buy a car from them. Make sure you get in writing what they are promising especially when you lease. I just had a negative experience with Spreen where they promised to pay the excess miles (on a previous car) but hadn't. We did not know that Spreen had not paid the excess miles until our credit scores kept getting hit for several months. Spreen was also very evasive when I tried calling them to help resolve the issue. In the end, I ended up paying for the excess miles. Acura was not very helpful either when I reported the issue. All in all, an extremely bad expereince from the dealership.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I have been a customer of the Acura dealership in Riverside for almost twenty years. On those occasions when ownership changed, I was concerned. Will service and quality remain as it has been? My 2013 RDX recently needed a major repair. Although I’d had similar issues during the warranty period, the onboard system never generated a service code. And when I drove into the dealership, the problem with the transmission wouldn’t repeat so they had no real way to know the problem. Recently the problem appeared again, and I drove immediately to the dealership. Bobby in Service remembered my past problems and immediately got a mechanic to drive the car and check it out. This time the problem generated a code which they were able to research and analyze. The problem. Bad valve in the transmission. Solution; a new transmission. Despite being about 3000 miles past warranty, Bobby contacted Acura, reviewed my service and the history of this problem with them. In the end, thanks to Bobby’s working on my behalf, I got that new transmission under warranty instead of paying several thousand dollars. So I gladly give Bobby and  Spreen Acura in Riverside a strong five stars. This kind of customer care and service makes for loyal, long-term customers. Thanks!<//Review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>Love my vehicle, but I think if you are working at a car dealership you should know simple math. This is the wrong business if you can’t add your numbers up. Also, the communication is very poor here. Between 3 different people and hearing 3 different numbers when purchasing your first car, it is unprofessional and very unpleasant to hear as you were told a price that couldn’t have been made by one manager that was made by a different manager. Not everyone is on the same page here. There are also things that buyers should be told what they need to bring in prior to coming back in and purchasing the vehicle. Edgar was a good salesman and had good information about the vehicle, but it seemed like his management didn’t support him.< /Review>< Pics>

Excellent service department. Purchased my third vehicle from this dealer through owner loyalty program, very pleased.

Just had another fantastic experience with Spreen Acura. Now on my second lease through the Acura loyalty program. 5 vehicles since 2007. Devon was great, really helpful and attentive. She made the process very smooth. Would definitely recommend Spreen Acura<//Text>

My experience of buying an Acura RDX was just fabulous at Spreen Acura! Britney worked with me on the pricing, the best financing rates, and any discount that I could get. She was very informative and polite and worked with me on getting a car that suited my needs and wants. And Omar took over the responsibility of going over the finer details of the entire purchase. Omar is very knowledgeable and patiently provided all information which I needed to know.
Both Britney and Omar deserve a thumbs up for their professionalism, courteousness and a “no pressure” attitude.< /Text>

Kevin did an awesome job and I so much appreciate him.  I was over due for my A1 service when suddenly my brakes started making a noise.  I am widow who depends on my car for work.  Kevin immediately got my car in and provided me with a loaner.  The work was completed quickly and he even honored my coupon.  I have now purchased three Acuras at this dealership and it is because of the service that I know I can trust as a widow.  Both Bobbie and Kevin do an amazing job.   Opal Singleton<//Text>

I found that Spreen Acura was very professional. My experience with them has always been excellent Just a simple things like setting your car radio or your clock they are always more than happy to help you out. Yesterday I bought a car and between Jay and Omar they really work hard to put me into a nice car however I would like another key one key is not going to work for me but I'm going back in and have one made so when you thinking about getting a car .Think about Spreen Acura.And how u want to be treated during the process  Their whole team are professional at all times and for senior that means a lot to me. So
Acura is a place to go.Spreen Accra is excellent when it comes to buying a new car and taking care of you nicely during process and very professional doing the process, Happy New Years Linda Mejia<//text>

Excellent pricing! Great service that went the extra mile. My salesperson delivered my vehicle to me so I wouldn’t need to repeat the drive! They also expedited the paperwork and tried to accommodate my needs as much as possible without delaying other customers in the process. Would definitely consider doing business with them again.</text>

Grateful for Wi-Fi in the Lounge area so I could work remotely

Alternative music blaring from the dealership was a little loud at 7am the morning. Definite change in vibe for the customer experience, especially older clients.< /Text>

The staff was awesome! They were very friendly and helpful. They even stayed after hours to show me the different features of the car and help set them up. Not a single complaint. Every member of the staff was great!<//Text>

Wonderful!  Great car too.

I bought a used car from Spreen and it was supposed to go through an inspection. 2 days after buying it the battery is completely dead. I've called the dealership 4 or 5 times now to speak with a manager and every time they are with a customer or at lunch. It doesn't matter what time of the day it is. I was promised a call back every time and still havent received one. I'll be going elsewhere for my wife's new car.</Review>

Never thought I'd leave leasing my car 2 nights ago... when I say Omar is wonderful, I absolutely mean it. He was calming and honest from the get go.
I have NEVER walked away after buying a new car with such a feeling of calm and general happiness. I usually dread going to the finance office after I make the deal, but even Luis had us laughing in his office.
No pressure here. No lies & a genuine openness from Omar R. I even called to let the dealer know how lucky I felt to have worked with them.
I've NEVER given a car dealership such a high rating before, but Omar absolutely deserves it. I will never accept anything less again.
Want a painless & quick experience? Come here to see Omar!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The buying process was easy and not bothersome

The problem was getting my car to me
It took over 2 hrs after finial papers were signed to get my car to me.  They kept saying they were detailing it. When I got it it was still wet  streaks in the windows. Dirty on some parts.  Still had the plastic on a lot of the inside.

If this part gets better then I would rate a higher rating< /text>

This place is awesome. Just leased a 2018 MDX here and couldn’t be more satisfied with the overall purchase. Steven you were above and beyond our expectations. If there is any advice I can give you if you stay in the car business it is simply one thing. “Always stay green”. You have a good heart and actually care about the customer. A lot of salesman get corrupted by this business so that’s why I say that. I’ve been doing this for 15 years and I’ve always remained true to myself. You will always sell cars if your honest and you keep your integrity. Thanks so much for everything you did for me and my wife. And thanks again to Spreen Acura.

Very satisfied customer here.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>People, be careful about doing business with this dealer. I am completing re-writing this review after finding out some shady strategies the sellers at this dealer use. I bought a used 2017 Honda Civic in January, 2020 from this dealer. I bought it Saturday and I took it to work Monday. On my way to work, I noticed that the car was always pulling to the left. After work, I took the car to Service and they told me that it was an alignment problem. Next day, I drove the car to work and still the same thing, the car was pulling and venting to the left. As a result of the car constantly pulling to the left, I went to double check the car history to make sure the car did not have collision or accident history.  Well, according to the link Ventica Rodriguez sent me, the car seemed to have a clean record with not damage or accident car history but I always was suspicious about the car pulling to the left and the helicopter noise the engine makes. Today, I found out that the car has damages reported from the previous owner on September 6, 2019 and September 27, 2019. Now, I understand why I could not open the Car fax report for this car when I tried to check the history of this car. Instead, Ventica Rodriguez sent me a link with an Experian car report that did not show anything about the previous damages.  Just a few minutes ago, I tried to open the link she sent me and the link is disable now. I deeply regret doing bussines with these people. I am not happy with the car. They never fixed the problem and the general manager Matt told me in an email that they were not in the business of making used car new. He gave me that answer because I told him to fix the problem of my car. Overall, this was a horrible experience since the begging. I remember the man that was doing the final paper work telling me that they were not going to sell the car if I did not buy the extended warranty or the GAP insurance. I told them that that was ok but I needed my $ 2000 down payment back ASAP. At the end, they sold me the car without me buying any of those additional stuff they want to sell you to make more money out of you, but the person seemed upset.  People be careful with this dealer, they are not honest. I am stuck with the lemon car they sold me and it feels terrible paying for something you are not happy with.</review>< pictures>

<Text>Dustin was awesome in assisting me with my recent purchase of a 2016 TLX. He was very patient and took me on three test drives because I was having trouble deciding on a particular car. I would have given five stars but I was not pleased with the handling of the financing portion. It should have been a smooth process because I already had a CU approval but they made it more difficult than it needed to be. Thanks Dustin.<//Text>< pics>

Personnel friendly and courteous Bobby in Service and Ronnie in Sales. However, I'm disappointed with the performance of my car after I brought it in for service. The issues are still there and although I was advised any problems return. That wasn't an option because the issues reserviced once I was 3hrs heading back to Stockton, California.  I won't be able to return to Spreen until the 12th of December and due to the fact I have to drive my car,  that other issues might surface.

<text>Ron is really great at his job. I had initially rejected his offer however he still convinced me to get the car. I liked his salesmanship and his positive and caring attitude towards his customers. He didn't make any false promises or played any tricks. So far it has been a pleasure working with them and I hope it will be even better from here.

Bought a used car there. (After buying 3 new from Spreen Honda).  Couple of issues came up. They took care of everything in a very professional and efficient manner.  One if the main managers called me directly to help me resolve these issues.  Thanks guys!  I knew I could count on you.<//text>

<text>I am amazed at the professionalism and thoroughness of this service center.  When I had my car towed to these guys, I was out of there with a no cost loaner car within 20 minutes.  When my car was in the shop, it was inspected and each area of the car was rated.  This was great!  I could see what I would need to address in the future.  The pricing was fair and the work was completed quickly!  Thank you John for a great experience.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I highly recommend driving all the way from L.A. They have the best and most honest service anywhere. Even a year after I purchased my car, they were helping me navigate my local Honda dealer as to what was the best way to order a new tire lock without ordering a whole set (as was suggested by my local dealer). I will make the drive out again to purchase my next car from them!<//Text>

We recently purchased a 2018 MDX at Acura of Riverside and couldn't be any more satisfied. From start to finish, Adam Greene went above and beyond to answer any questions that we had in an extremely timely manner. He was transparent in regard to pricing from the very beginning and made the experience as enjoyable as a car-buying experience could be. He was attentive and proactive, but not in a way where we ever felt pressured or outside of our comfort zone. I also had the opportunity to work with Ken French and Vanessa Valdez who were also very helpful throughout the process. It is absolutely clear that they have a team that cares about their customers. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone in the market for a new Acura!<//Text>

I traded in my old acura for new car from Spreen acura which was painless. Salesforce were not under pressure for sales since they not on an individual  commission based compensation. This business model promotes an atmosphere of camaraderie in the staff. Dealership does not add unwanted or unnecessary items to  bolster their profit margin which is an exception to the rule. Our sales person Jerimiah was a  friendly no nonsense  professional person who was knowledgeable about the vehicle. He helped to facilitate the financing process with Daniel in record time. I should also mention that my past experiences with the service department particularly Bobby is exceptional. Spreen management is fortunate in having them on their team.<//review>

This was the first time I purchased a car over the internet.  Not only was the final purchase price lower than the local dealer, even including the cost to ship the car to me, but I also was able to purchase the model and color that I wanted three weeks sooner than I could have buying local.  Thanks Ron Andrews and all of the staff at Riverside who helped make this a very positive car buying experience.</Review>

We had a great experience here at Acura of Riverside, a lot due to working with Fernando Coronado. He's was very direct, transparent, informative, and wasn't too pushy when we told him we wanted to wait a couple months to purchase. I would highly recommend dealing with him if you decide to come here!< /Review>

All the employees and managers who talked with us were helpful and friendly. Also the price was good too. The only reason we didn't end up buying from this dealership was that we got an insane deal on another car. If you are in market for a luxury car, I recommend to check this place too.< /Text>

I just leased a 2018 Acura ILX from Brittany.  She was not only kind to me but she cared about my needs and what I could afford and was willing to pay.  The customer service is top notch here, from the sales team down to the service team with Bobby & John.

<username>Edward Rios< /username><Rate>5<//Rate><review>No one likes to go and buy a vehicle at the “Dealership” Well maybe my experience will help with your decision about coming to SPREEN ACURA. Here’s my experience. I first called the Dealership to verify that the Certified Pre Owned vehicle was on stock. Sabrina answered and verified so I set an appointment to test drive. Upon my arrival I was greeted and assisted by Edgar who was very helpful in showing me vehicles. Then Edgar introduced me to Joel who got me through all the necessary documentation needed to apply for a loan. Both Sales Consultants showed patience and made sure I was comfortable offering refreshments and snacks during my entire time at the dealership. Then there was Sir Ryan who is the Sales Manager who process’s my application to the bank. He’s the gentleman who you’ll only be able to identify from his forehead to the top of his hair because he’s behind a really tall desk. Sir Ryan made the approval simple although I expected him to be a Shark he was actually very helpful and kept the process simple. Now it’s time to see the Finance Manager. Sir Omar was Top Notch at getting me through the Final Paperwork. He had very good customer service skills and did not keep the conversation dry. He is not your typical “Finance guy” who doesn’t care for your satisfaction. Sir Omar really does his best to make sure your happy with the whole process. I give SPREEN ACURA 5 STARS and I will be returning with family members soon to purchase from here again. You guys are Awesome! See you soon!</review>< Pics>

So I came to Acura after 3 other dealerships wanting to trade in my car for a newer used car. I worked with Fernando Coronado, HE WAS EXCELLENT! He was patient he was not pushy, even after not taking the car I first wanted he took his time to help me find a car that fit in my budget - and I love it. I am so happy with the service I got here and with my new car !!!!< /review>

I was very disappointed in the service manager that handled my account. Bobby Howard. When I came to pick up my car he did NOT go  over the work that was done to my car. He through my paper work to a gal that was on the phone with someone else. She printed out the work report and rang me up but NO ONE went over the work that was done on my car.

Deryk took my car in an wrote me up.<//text>

Not many cars, for the model we wanted, MDX
told us we only had two models to look at, a black 2018, and a Red 2019...maybe cause it's close to the end of the month?

Basically, never going back, waste of time.< /Review>

Fernando Coronado was a huge help. This was my first time at this dealership and first time purchasing an Acura, but I felt at ease through the entire process. He is incredibly knowledgeable of the vehicles and will go above and beyond to make sure you feel confident driving your new car off the lot. Great salesman not your typical car salesperson and a huge asset to the dealership.<//Review>

<Review>Claimed over the phone that they dont bait and switch but on the day they refused to sell the car without a $1300 alarm system option.

I visited Spreen this weekend with my partner who was looking to buy a used 2017 ILX. After the test drive we both loved the car and were set to buy. The sales person took the car back to be detailed and we went in to finalise the paperwork.We explained to the sales person that we would be able to pay cash up front for the advertised price. Unfortunately, the sales person went to speak with their manager and informed us that there was a $1300 active alarm extra that was not included in the list price but had already been installed on the car. We then asked to see the installed alarm system. The sales person left again and when they returned they informed us that the alarm was actually being installed as we spoke. We asked again if they could stop the installation and sell it without but they refused. Keep in mind that we were buying outright, not financing, so the alarm would not be protecting their assets at all. We ended up walking out carless and frustrated due to their very shady bait and switch.

I think the fact that they were willing to let us walk from a cash sale and lose any relationship we had in order to force an add on that hadnt even been installed for the test drive is extremely scummy and unbecoming of an Acura dealership. I cant think of any better proof that the alarm is a purely profit driven gotcha than that. They informed us that this would be mandatory on all of their used cars from now on so if you dont want to experience these sales tactics yourself then dont waste your time with Spreen.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>I leased an Acura RDX from 2015-2018. When I turned in my vehicle, I left some personal property (a FasTrack transponder with a significant amount of credit on it) in my vehicle. I returned several days later to pick this up, but the transponder was no longer in my vehicle. I spoke to management to see if they could help me find my transponder. Multiple attempts to contact the dealership and follow up with them went unanswered. After my fifth phone call a week later, a manager called me back and explained that they couldn’t find my property and there was nothing they could or would do to rectify this.

I was very disappointed with how Spreen Acura handled this matter. I expect a higher level of customer service from a luxury car dealership. I do not like the fact that my personal property went missing and management did not attempt to make things right. In my opinion, the way they handled this was very unprofessional and the fact that my property went missing in the first place should raise questions as well. Please keep this in mind should you choose to do business with Spreen Acura.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>When this was Hendrick Acura it was 5 ✴️✴️✴️✴️✴️but now that Spreen has taken over the service has gone down. Went in for routine maintenance & oil change only to get home (after waiting 2 hours for a supposedly 30 minute service) and find out that items that were supposed to have been accomplished weren't taken care of. Called up the service Dept asked for Bobby to call me back. To date no call back...... (This was my original post) *** This is our go to dealer for Acuras as a family we have purchased Five actors from this place and I've never once been disappointed we've never felt taken advantage of we have never felt cheated we also use the service department because we always feel we get good service good value great treatment for our money if you ever have any questions ask for Ken French he's our go-to guy and after you meet him he will be your go-to guy< /Text>< UserId.>

I just purchased a beautiful 2017 Acura RDX. I sent in an email, Ron Andrews promptly responded with all the information I requested. The price for the vehicle was best out of three dealerships I researched. Ron said he would have the car parked out front waiting for me. It was the exact car we discussed. Ron made the whole transaction go smoother than I thought possible. I recommend Ron  and this dealership to anyone who is looking for a quality car and a great buying experience.<//Review>

I have had my 2013 Acura TL for a while now and I must say that one of the best parts of coming to Acura of Riverside is the service department.  I mainly deal with Anthony Briseño which always makes my visits a pleasure to deal with.  He's always very informative and prompt to answer any questions that I have.  At the time of typing this review, I recently sold my 2013 Acura TL and went with another car brand, I just hope that the new service department that I will now be going to has a competent and easy to deal with service representative like Anthony.</text>

I've been bringing/buying my cars here since 2000 I have never been disappointed in them. My car is always taken care of, I am always taken care of and I am always shown courtesy and respect. I have never been exposed to pushy sales tactics by service or sales, which is huge to me. In my opinion the level of all around service and reliability makes the dealership well worth any so called savings from taking it elsewhere. Here you know your parts are new and warrantied, the labor is guaranteed, and the car wash is a nice bonus.</Text>

I don’t know how they have such high reviews, seems like they pay people for them because my experience with them was beyond horrible. I talked to the manager Chris over the phone about a specific vehicle, he later called me to say he’ll lower the price $1000 and to make an appointment with him, to which I agreed. My appointment was at 9 am, and I got 2 phone calls from 2 different people confirming my appointment. I told them I’m on my way. I asked for Chris when I got there and I was told he’s busy but they will pull out the car for me. 40 minutes later and no one comes over to talk to me and the car was still not pulled up. I ask another girl that’s working there about Chris, and she tells me he’s not even there and she can’t go look for him in the men’s bathroom! I had to ask her twice to contact him or have anyone else help us out. The car is finally pulled up after a 45 minute wait, and it was soo dirty inside and out! We try to take it for a test drive but the car wouldn’t even start bc the battery is dead. I finally decided that I’ve had enough and it’s time to go. Someone else working there comes to talk to me, not sure of his name, but his speech was slurred and his pant zipper was open. Very professional! Please save your time and go to a different dealer.<//text>

This was the second car my family purchased here, and we wouldn't go anywhere else. Fernando Coronado was so helpful, answering all of our questions and being patient with us while we found the perfect fit. I enjoyed not feeling pressured, and being able to get his genuine advice about each of the Acuras we were considering. He made this such an easy process. He's such a great guy, he really cared that I left there happy - and I did!! The Finance Manager, Adrian Brauner, was clear and direct and I appreciated his expertise. He gave me options and ultimately ensured I had the best possible deal. Big John was involved the whole way, and totally attentive to any requests. They make a great team! Thanks guys!!

The internet stopped working causing my paperwork to be done after 1am during the Christmas holidays. Driving the car home it smelled of cigarette smoke. When I callled informing the staff the response was what do you want us to do about it. The sales associate was off due to the holidays so I had to talk to various people to get the smoke smell out. I still need to get it detailed that will take all day. When the sales associate returned I informed about a missing mat the response was it was priced to sell even though before I mention a car Manuel that was able to be supplied from a different associate. To get anything done I have had to talk to 5 different people.< /Text>

He was also very knowledge about the car, and when it came to reaching an agreement to buy the car, he made it very easy.  Abel, thank you so much for what you did for us.

<Review>Terrible experience buying a new car from this dealership.  Had arranged the deal a week before and made an appointment to sign papers and pick up car.  Nothing was organized and took two and half hours to finally get the car.  Ready to go you would think but now they wanted another hour and half to install the cover and floor mats.  They wouldn’t start doing that until paperwork was all done.

Price went up $10 a month supposedly because we didn’t take Acura’s finance offer the first time two months prior so now Acura raised the payments.  Seemed strange but who’s going to argue over $10 when you’ve waited this long.

Nobody reviewed any of the cars features or how anything worked.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I've been a customer of Acura of Riverside for three years, after purchasing my RDX from them.
Everything about this dealership is first-rate - I decided to purchase the vehicle there in the first place because of their attitude - and that attitude continued on through the service department- everything and everyone is excellently professional and friendly.
It is no small consideration that I pass many other Acura dealerships on my 25 mile one way trip to get to this dealership, including one in my own town - less than 4 miles from my house.</review>< Pictures>

I went to Spreen Acura on a Thursday evening, arriving at 8:20 p.m. It was pretty quiet around the showroom at that time of night. Hunter the Acura Salesman came out of his office and said hello. I told him that I wanted to check out the Acura RDX, which is a SUV version of the four door aging sedan that I am currently driving. He said, "Look no further, you are standing right beside one." He showed me the inside of the showroom model, then he went to the back lot, and reappeared with an Acura RDX that looked just like the one in the showroom. He said, "Get in, and make yourself comfortable." He got in the passenger side, and gave me a nice verbal tour of the features in the cockpit of the RDX. Then we rolled out of the dealership driveway and did circle around the Riverside Auto Center. He had me try the Comfort versus Sport modes, and pointed out a few other features. When we got back to the dealership, he parked the RDX and we chatted awhile longer about the RDX and other non-car related topics. He told me that when I was ready to buy, to come visit him.
The whole experience was friendly and low key. Hunter was not the typical pushy car salesman. It was one of my best car shopping experiences.</text>

<review>I purchased a new RDX at Riverside's Spreen Acura on 9/1/2018. The process of buying was fairly good even though the sale associate who worked with us was not very knowledgeable. However, the customer service after the purchase is terrible.
There were some scratches on the front bumper of the car. The dealer promised to fix/repaint. I left the car at the dealer for the fix and had an appointment to pick it up at 11:00 am on 9/8/18. The appointment was a joke. We did not see our car until 2:00 pm even though I had checked with the associate on the appointment time before leaving San Diego to make sure we didn't have to wait at the dealer very long since we had to bring a small child along.
At the dealership, we expected to have the scratches fixed and the car detailed before we take it home. While inspecting, we noticed the car was dirty, talked to the associate who delivered the car but she did not say anything.  The child was very tired of the unexpected long wait. So, we had to leave for San Diego.
Knowing that my car was not detailed as it was supposed to, I have texted, emailed, talked on the phone with several people at Spreen beginning 9/9/18 but have not heard anything back. They just simply ignored my messages.
I don't recommend Riverside's Spreen Acura since they don't care about their customers after the purchase. In addition, the two associates who worked with us during the purchase and delivery are not very knowledgeable.< /review>< pics>

Bought a car from here. It was my first purchase for a car and it went smooth for the most part but I didn’t receive my plates for over 3 months. Then my finance loaner mailed me a letter saying I needed to title and register the car. I thought the delearship did all that for me. Anyways, I’ve called multiple times the past 3-4 days and no one could help me. Not even the finance department. I’ve tried taking to Luis from finance multiple times and he fails to call me back or help me resolve the issue. If I could do it all over again, I would buy a car from a different Acura dealership.< /text>

Had a GREAT experience leasing my 2012 Acura TL. Most of the "work" was done over the phone so by time I went there it was just a matter of signing and then driving away! Everyone is so nice and they are super workable with budgets! Will DEFINITELY go back for my next Acura!

John Crook did his homework and found that there was a software update that fixes that "juttering" in the transmission. Yesterday was the battery, I called him and he said to bring it in. In less than 30 minutes my battery was replaced and my TL was washed.<//Review>< Pictures>

Spreen Acura was great in my buying experience for my new RDX. The Sales manager Chris was very helpful and upfront and honest about everything. Once I got there Kanoa Assisted me from start to finish with the purchase of my new car and was great! Even David in financing was very honest  and got me in and out. I have bought several cars throughout my life and I can say 100% that Spreen is honest and gives you the best deals possible! I drove out from San Diego and worth every mile. No pushy sales Tatics there. You get what you want for a seriously great deal.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>Worse interaction with a car dealership EVER!!!

Called them to ask to put a deposit down on a used 2016 ILX. I was told, "We do not hold vehicles Even with a $10k deposit, due to not having a contract". I asked how we get a contract? The answer you have to be in person to do so. I explained 2 different times I live in a different state, I will be driving there this weekend to purchase. Their answer, "No problem see you then". So I of course was happy they changed their minds and said oh, so you will hold it. NO, was the response I got. I then asked am I just supposed to take a gamble that it will still be there when I get there. They reply, "Yup, if someone else buys it before then there is nothing we can do about it." I've purchased 3 different Acuras brand new and am making my decision soon if I will be getting another new MDX. At this point I will tell every one I know to avoid this place. Worst service I've ever encountered. I did ask to speak to the manager, I was told that is Chris Rushing. When the sales man got back on the phone he said Chris is not going to get on the phone to tell you the same thing I just said. I asked is he refusing to speak to me, YES was the answer. AGAIN... AVOID THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I just got a car at the Acura Of Riverside on 5/22/17. Since the beginning of the month of May I had been looking for a car and it was impossible to qualify for a car since 7 years ago I went through a divorce and then a few years ago I went through hardship and got a car repoed.  Well everywhere I went I could not qualify either I had to put a big chunk of money down and a payment that was out of this world.  Jonathon at Acura of Riverside helped me out I had my eye on a 2015 Chrysler 200 Limited Edition I told him my situation and it was a Sunday almost closing time and I thought after this I am just going to wait and save some more money so I can get a car. Well I gave him all the info and he told me he would call me back the next day (Monday) so that next day we were dealing back and forth by  530pm I went in signed the paperwork and came out with my new car I was so impressed at the Acura Of Riverside the do help people out with no credit to bad credit. I put little down and my payments are unbelievably low I would highly recommend Acura Of Riverside to everyone.<//Text>

great price,however worst customer service. "appointment" is a joke in that you are treated as a "walk in". sales reps unfamiliar with ACURA sales programs,online credit application ignored, vehicle delivered with one incorrect key fob and only 1/2 tank of gas. NO customer parking</Text>

I had a slow leak in my tire that was caused by a leaking valve stem. I noticed that the pressure was low when I returned to the parking lot at LAX Saturday evening after a trip to Europe. AAA put more air in the tire, and I brought the car in on Monday. Bobby was in charge of the service. I wasn't even charged!< /text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>First good impression about Spreen Acura was established when Katelyn Black assured me of the good customer service  that they render. Katelyn was so honest and nice. Instead of waiting for the RDX 2019, I ended up leasing a 2018 RDX, because of the "good customer service" that Katelyn was saying. Rommel, the Salesman, converted my interest into a lease rather than waiting for the 2019 RDX. However, I almost cancelled the lease when the unit was not delivered to my home the following day at 10:00 am as promised. I said to myself, the promise is broken. I was kept waiting until about 2:00 pm when it was finally delivered. Also, reviewing the contract now, I find Item #13 unclear. It was skipped in the discussion with Luis, the Finance Manager. I have some questions about this and I need written explanation and clarification. Overall, the people at Spreen Acura Riverside are so polite and so cordial. They indeed focus on "customer service". Not so perfect though but okay and tolerable.< /Text>< Pics>

I just wanted to share my experience so no one else goes thru the same thing. I went in with the intention of buying a car and not leasing it. When the numbers were presented they made it a huge difference in buying vs leasing. I had liked the payment on the lease and that's were I messed up by agreeing. They offered me different quotes with and without down payment and they said every 1k is 32 dollars a month you save but the 0 zero down vs 2k down was nearly a 200 dollar difference? Why lie? anyways, I had asked about my credit score and what it came out with twice and both times the sales rep "forgot" to get the sheet to show me and would steer the conversation a different way. I ended giving 3k down for this lease, after everything I decided to take my contract to my credit union and they went thru the whole contract with me. The 3k I gave down disappeared in those numbers. At the end of it all those 3k never helped with getting the car meaning the dealer just kept it and could of given me what I had at 0 down. Purchasing was a better deal for me due to my high credit score, it came out as a tier one credit and when they did the contract they gave me a deal of a tier 2 or tier 3 credit worthiness. I tried reaching out to them to get some sort of explanation, I know it's a bit late now but just wanted to inform everyone to watch their contract and my recommendation go thru a credit union first, second avoid this dealer.<//Text></record>

<review>John in service and Ken in sales went out of their way to help two stranded travelers on the eve of July 4th. We were towed in at 7 PM the night before a holiday, John had arranged for a loaner vehicle to be waiting for us (service had closed).  They went above and beyond the call of duty, and I will be eternally grateful. They found the issue with my RDX, it was under warranty and I drove home (back to the Bay Area) safely without issues. The whole team at Acura of Riverside is courteous and polite, couldn't be more impressed.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
The experience of purchasing the car was mostly positive, other than the salesperson insisting that the bumper on one car had not been repainted when clearly it was a different shade than the rest of the car.  It has been a major headache since then.  I realized on the drive home that the car, a '15 TLX V6, shifted hard in certain gears.  It was still under warranty, so I took it to the dealer near me within a couple of days.  The car needed an entirely new transmission, and it was in the shop for almost 3 weeks.  It also needed new tires.  I would think that an ACURA dealer would be able to tell that an ACURA needed a new transmission. Fortunately my local dealer is fantastic and got the entire thing covered for me and kept me in a loaner until it was done.

Though I live in Arizona and gave them an Arizona address with my Arizona license and told them I was taking the car back to Arizona they decided to register the car in California, wasting $300 of my money.  Now I get to try and fight the CA DMV for a refund because they insist that I made the mistake and that I should have no problem driving a car in AZ with CA plates when I am an AZ resident.  They are wrong, and the first time I get pulled over I will be cited.  I'm sure they know they are wrong, but the finance manager didn't want to admit that he screwed up.

EDIT - I have to give credit to Matt, the VP for Spreen group. He made the effort to speak with me, and we were able to come to a resolution on the registration issue. While it shouldn’t have come to that, in the end I felt like he was willing to do the right thing and is committed to taking care of customers.</review>

I picked up my 2019 Acura RDX a week ago and I Love It!!

The buying experience was extraordinary, because  the people and customer care is top notch.

I called  Spreen knowing what I wanted and Chris Rushing madenit happen!  I was specific about  the specs and cost and it wasn’t in stock so he went out of his way to source the vehicle. It took 2 weeks to find and it didn’t look like it would happen but he suprised me with a call on Sunday with the great news and it was at the negotiated price.  No gimmics.

He is tenacious, honest and genuine and a true pleasure to work with.

Bianca was really knowledgeable and she ensured the car was ready for possession and spent time demonstrating all the features with me. And there are a lot!  And lastly, the Finance manager, Luis, was friendly and knowledgeable as well and a pleasure to work with.

I highly recommend this dealership.

I test drove the car at Carlsbad Acura and they would barely budge on price. A Kearny Mesa rep sent me an email telling me I can’t afford the car because i would’ve pay MSRP. And three other dealerships wouldn’t budge on price and wanted to sell me what they had in in inventory.<//review>

<review>The deal: amongst Montclair Acura and weir canyon’s Acura, sprees Acura in Riverside was able to give us the best deal. We paid $1100 less compared to Montclair‘s quote, and about $1000 less compared to weir canyon’s quote for Labor Day weekend incentives. They even threw in a coating protectant for free! We’ll  definitely come back if we need another Acura. We love that they are straightforward with negotiations and there’s really no surprises.

The sales person: we worked with Devon and she is absolutely amazing, incredibly friendly and very efficient. I told her from the beginning that we have a two-year-old and needed most of the negotiating to be done over the phone, and she did everything she could to reduce our time sitting at the dealership. We got there 30 minutes before closing, and she stayed until past 11 PM to make sure she was available for any questions that we may have.

The car: we got the Acura MDX SH-AWD with Tech package and we are incredibly happy with it. Just a few days of driving it and we know we love it way better than our Mazda CX-9 touring. Blindspot detection, keyless entry, electronic folding mirror, seat plus mirror memory (allows 2 memory settings), Lane detection, cruise control, and overall driving performance outperforms our Mazda by a mile. It’s also smaller on the outside but more spacious on the inside compared to the Mazda. We also love that the Apple CarPlay syncs our phone onto the car’s navigation screen so we can use Maps, Spotify, Phone and text/Siri seamlessly.<//review>< Date>

It’s been a long ordeal with Spreen Acura but now that all has been said and done, I can honestly say that I am very happy with the service I have received.

In the first week of March, my husband and I decided to stop by Spreen Acura to check out an MDX. I was helped by Rommel, a hard working, nice young gentleman. I ended up buying a new 2018 MDX and at the time of purchase, we also decided to add running boards (for my kids and for me because I’m short). There were 3 options and we chose the Sport running board. This one turned out to be a big mistake for us because for some reason it only has a step for the 2nd row and not the front row, making it pointless for the short driver and front row passenger. Unfortunately the picture of the Sport running boards on the Acura website does not clearly show this, so we couldn’t tell. So a week later or so, I went to pick up the car after the running boards were installed and to my surprise, I noticed the lack of running board for the front row. I was disappointed but in a hurry to pick up my kids so I left. The very next day I called Rommel asking him if there was any way I could exchange them for the advance running boards and that I would pay the difference in price of the boards ($34) and the installation cost (within reason). The initial response after Rommel checked with his boss was “No.” I was extremely disappointed, since I hadn’t even stepped on the boards yet and I had offered to pay for the exchange, not like I was asking for a freebee. I obviously wasn’t happy and Rommel knew this, so after several weeks and lots of calls/texts back and forth and Rommel’s hard work and persistence to keep the customer happy and satisfied, I finally got the call from Rommel that they were willing to trade in my boards for the one I wanted at a cost of $400.00.

Knowing that we initially chose the wrong running boards, I agreed with paying the $400.00 out of pocket. Rommel advised me that Service would call me soon to set up my installation appointment but 2 more weeks went by with nothing. So I decided to call and follow up and I spoke to Kyle Lucas from the Service Department who seemed unaware of such an appointment and vaguely knew what I was talking about. He said he’d look into it and would call me back. About 30 minutes later I got a call from Anthony from Service to schedule the installation and finally 2 days later I got the boards exchanged! But then came time to pick up my car and keys. The girl at the counter tells me my cost was over $1000.00! I was completely shocked. We spoke to Anthony who had no idea what was going on. I advised him that I had spoken to Rommel and my cost would be no more than $400.00 + tax. It was late Friday so he asked me to take my car home and that he would contact me come Monday after he would speak to some people. Monday came and went.. and another 2-3 weeks. I didn’t get a call so I decided to call again and follow up on payment since I didn’t want this issue hanging over my head anymore and just wanted to pay and be done with it. I spoke to Anthony who informed me that I should’ve gotten a call from some other department in regards to the payment. I advised him I hadn’t received any calls so he said that he would look into it. Anthony called me back within 10 minutes and told me that he spoke to some managers and Spreen Acura decided to call it a wash on the payment! So I didn’t owe them anything! It was definitely a nice surprise and I was so excited to finally have the boards I wanted and be done with the whole ordeal. Although it took weeks to resolve, I am thankful for the outcome and I can now say I love my new car.

I want to thank Rommel again for his hard work, his persistence and great customer service. I would also like to thank Anthony for his great customer service and his assistance. And of course, thank you Spreen Acura for making me a very happy customer.<//review>

After driving the car for 1500 miles and 1 month, the battery went dead.  I proceeded to call the dealership and spoke to the sales manager Ken.  I asked Ken if the battery was part of the 100 point inspection and he said that he did not know.  Being a mechanic myself, I knew I was about to get my chain yanked.  How does a manager selling cars not know what is or is not included in the 100 point inspection.  Battery would be on that list for sure.  After letting Ken know that I was a mechanic, he changed his tune a bit and said he would find out if the battery is part of the inspection.  He said he called the service manager and proceeded to tell me that it was part of the inspection and that the battery was checked.  I was also told by Fernando while purchasing the vehicle that the car went through the 100 point inspection.  Ken, the sales manager, called me back and proceeded to tell me that the car only went through a 30 point inspection.  Hmmm....  either way, it's false advertising at this point.  I let Ken know that this was not good customer service.  Ken said he could not help me in any way to replace the battery.  I let Ken know that I would be writing a review of my experience and that was the end of our conversation.  About an hour later, the dealership manager Ken Welsh(different Ken) calls me and proceeds to tell me that he would like to make the situation right and said he would reimburse me for HALF of the new battery which was about $65.  I let him know that this was not about the money and it was more about taking care of a customer that just spent close to $30,000 at his dealership.  I declined his offer to send me a check for $65 after I sent him the receipt for the new battery.  He did not want me to write a negative review and kept me on the phone for about 15 minutes trying to persuade me to take the $65 and call it a day.  I was not about to take $65 to not write about my experience about this dealership.  I will not take hush money and I would like the public to know about my experience and decide for themselves to purchase a new or used vehicle from Hendrick's Acura of Riverside.  I read all the positive reviews about the sales and service department.  This may be due to paying people off with a few dollars or maybe a free oil change or tire balance.  Would it have been so difficult to just resolve the situation to make things right and have another happy customer?  I guess $130 was just not worth it!

I did want to mention the positive sides of my experience also.  Fernando Coronado my salesperson was truely AWESOME!  He is a young man who knows his products and is very knowledgeable.  Didn't experience any BS salesperson jargon and we got to the final sales price within 10 minutes and we drove away after about a 30 minute wait after the papers were all signed.  He is upfront, professional, and gets straight to the point.  I can't say enough nice things about Fernando.  Thank you very much for your service!  All the positive reviews about Fernando is all well deserved.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Extremity pleasant experience, beyond any expectations, dealing with Mr. Delancy Christion and his boss Ron (at the time of the purchase).
The whole negotiation (via email) with Delancy and the purchase was easy clear respectful and honest. When we finally got there to make the purchase, car, price, details were just like we talked about via email. We decided to buy from them, even if we had same offers from dealership much closer to us. We do not regret our decision a bit, everything they said the did. No catches, no tricks, no anything. Just amazing experience. As of now, when I think of next car we have to buy, I think of Acura, and Acura Riverside dealership particularly. Thank you guys.< /Text>

They went to every distance needed to provide me with a great sales process. Not the standard sales garbage. The team stayed late after hours with me to comfort my schedule. All representatives were very friendly, had great service, and were very helpful. I work in sales and service and very rarely find good service. Acura of Riverside has it covered. In addition the day after I purchased my vehicle I saw a small cosmetic issue. Toyota wanted to replace my entire bumper for $800 and take three days to do the work. I called Acura of Riverside and they took care of it at no charge in one day and gave me a complimentary newer rental vehicle while my Toyota was being worked on. Fiver stars well deserved. Special thanks to Jeff Hudson, Ileen Garibay, Chad, Travis and Alex in service, another lady in service that closes late(sorry I misplaced your name), and to the boss Mr. Harrera.< /review>< Date>

They had changed the oil, rotated tires, performed multi-point inspection and washed my car in 30 minutes tops.  The service department has always taken care of my car's needs.

This weekend I purchased a 2012 Acura MDX and worked with Adam Greene.  He was quick to reply to my online inquiry of the vehicle in their inventory. It was great working with him and he is also an owner of MDX himself.  He made both my husband and I very comfortable, answering questions we had and gave me the opportunity to take a good test drive on the hwy in addition to the main roads to make sure the vehicle was the right one.  Riverside has a great team of people working for them.  We had a great experience with Adrian Brauner the Finance Manager very helpful and informative and made a process smooth.  Would highly recommend this location to friends and family.  Thank you Acura of Riverside! I'm loving my MDX!< /text>

My experience was awesome! It was a toss up between the Infinity QX50 Lexus ES350 and Acura TLX. The handling of all the cars was great but it was the technology and the look of the console of the Acura that got me. my salesperson Bob Barro was extremely nice. He never was annoying with his followup.  He was very knowledgeable of Acura vehicles. Wasnt hovering or following us all over the lot as we looked around. And even when we purchased the vehicle Bob stayed with me to explain fully how the technology works.  If you're looking for someone to get you into the right car ...Bob is your guy.<//Text>

I have an Acura ILX.  It's about 2 years old.   I've taken it into Acura of Riverside about 4 times to fix a slow leak I have in one of the tires, they can't find the peoblem, but REFUSE to replace the tire.  They called me and said it was time for service, so I made an appointment and of course, letting them know of ALL the things that need repair, which were many!  I also advised them that I was disabled and would need a loaner, they said, No Problem.   I arrived to my appointment, they refused my loaner and was extremely rude.  I couldn't leave my car, due to his unwillingness to help me.  The business cards on the counter said, Cook.  Idk if it was him that I was dealing with.  I will never buy another Acura!!!!!!</text>

<Review>I had a very bad experience with this dealer. I hope that's not how they treat every customer. I bought 2005 Infiniti FX35 from this location with 90 days warranty, the car was leaking oil ( head gasket cover ) and they lied to me that the car was not leaking and when I tried to have them fix it the service manager Bobby Howard to me that I will have to pay $149.00 for diagnose. Diagnose? I took the car to 2 different mechanic and they did not charge me a penny to verify the problem, when  you pull up the hood of the car and look at the corner of the engine you will see the leaking. The fist time I brought the car back to fix, the lied to me and told me nothing was wrong with the car. I will fix my car and have the Judge decide the on it. They lack of customer service and they are liars.< /Review><Date>1458230679143< /Date><user>103479559047850250547<//user></record>

After many years of driving BMW's (which, after an extremely negative experience with BMW of Riverside and BMW of North America, I absolutely will never do again), Amin and Cassandra at Acura of Riverside made the transition to Acura and leasing so easy. They offered a fair price thousands below MSRP with no haggling, and more for my trade than anyone else.  I was also looking at Accords, but was able to get the Acura TLX for only about $1,500 more than an Accord EX-L; a small premium to pay for a nicer car from a luxury brand.  Unlike several other local dealerships, there was no phony Internet pricing, no hidden extras or overpriced dealer add-ons, and no bait and switch or high pressure sales tactics. Amin was very effective in explaining the advantages of leasing with an option to buy versus buying. The whole process was quick, painless, and very satisfying.

We just leased our second Acura in as many years from Cassandra Shamoun at Acura of Riverside.  Now we are a two Acura family.  Both times, Cassandra was very pleasant and easy to work with; not at all like the aggressive, superficially cordial, out-of-touch sharks circling the lots at some other dealerships.  Cassandra was knowledgeable about the product, and patient as we considered our options before finally choosing Acura.  The price was Truecar's highly discounted price without actually going through Truecar, and they gave us the high end of KBB for our trade-in.  Of course, the car is great.  You really can't beat Acura for value, and the RDX has the power and handling of a luxury sedan.  In all respects, a very satisfying transaction.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

This is our second experience with Acura of Riverside, and both experiences have been very pleasant. In the first transaction, we traded our RDX for a 2014 MDX. After shopping multiple dealerships for the right deal, the team at Riverside was able to meet our requirements and close the deal at a price that was very acceptable.

In this second transaction, the process was even better. They knew our MDX lease was coming to a close, and they offered to swap our 2014 MDX with a new 2017 MDX at a similar price with no money out of pocket.

After agreeing to a price, color, and features, all we had to do was figure out how to get to the dealer to complete the deal (we now live in San Diego) and all they had to do was find the vehicle configured as we requested. Once the right vehicle was located in Mission Viejo, Jonathan Marquez offered to go above and beyond to help close the deal so that we could receive our new vehicle without having to go to the dealer at all by driving it, along with the paperwork, to our house and exchange vehicles there. This was a remarkable service by Jonathan and he was very good about communication and timing so that we could plan for his arrival.

Once at our house, we completed the paperwork and a review of the new features of the new MDX within about 45 minutes.

We are delighted and would recommend Acura of Riverside to anyone who asks.

Thank you Jonathan, and your support team for making this happen so smoothly.< /Review>

< review>
!!!!DON'T  EVER GO TO THIS DEALER!!!! I would give it a 0 star if possible but i can't. don't  ever deal with AMIN SIDDIQ he is the worst person I have ever met. I have had 4 acuras that I usually buy at the Temecula dealer but Riverside had such good reviews that I decided to go. you do not know how much i regret it. I will never ever come back to this dealer and i will make sure everyone i know doesn't come here either. I am planning on calling the headquarters tomorrow and make a complaint. this Amid guy is racist, looks down at people, like why are you here if you cannot afford a car. he makes every effort  to make you feel discriminated. and makes it so clear that he doesn't  want to sell you a car. i drove 1 hr to this dealer, run my credit, and still got whatever documents  he needed and still couldn't  get the car i wanted. he wasn't willing to take any suggestions from the myself,  my husband or even his own salesman.he told the salesman "i will pay you whatever you were going to make on this deal".  He was very stubborn on not wanting to sell the car to me. We were complying with their policies to finish the paperwork, but over a simple car detail he wouldnt let the car go. Amin Siddiq is the worst person you can negotiate a car sales with, i can't stress enough how rude, arrogant, and pos type of person he is. His own salesman was disappointed to not sell the car when i was willing to take it home dirty! all the paperwork was done and yet he still didn't want to sell the car. He is in the wrong business if he acts this way with people and dont know what idiot put him of all people in charge of their dealership. Never again will i set foot nor recommend shopping for ANY car at this dealership.<//review>

<review>Had a appointment for a routine oil change. When I arrived I was told a 1 hour to hour and a half wait. So I asked for a loaner and was told only loaners for 3 hours of service or longer. The previous visit was told if I got my transmission serviced there along with my oil change a loaner would be provided but I told them on my next visit I'll do that. So when I asked for a oil change and transmission service I was told no loaner only shuttle.  Why was I told different? So I ended up waiting 2 hours . The reason I'm bother is because I waited so long then a customer came in for the same service  as me .as they me told my car was done and they gave her a loaner . It might be because she was a young attractive woman I don't know . But I'm a very disappointed customer. Looks like I'm taking my TL else where for service< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

On our first visit to this place it was more than we expected, we were looking for a 2015 Mustang and we not only managed to get it if not apart, the service offered by Fernando Coronado was the best we have received from all our visits to different agencies . We were very happy with this purchase and very satisfied to have achieved an excellent contract. Thanks Fernando!
