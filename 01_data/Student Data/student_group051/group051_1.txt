Sign outside says $0.99 but when I got inside...that was the catch! To get me inside because the $0.99 item is of course something no one really wants anyway. Left spending almost $15! It's the feeling of being fooled for me that I don't much appreciate.< /Review>

Stood in line for over 20 minutes to get a smoothie and finally got to the register to be told they were out of smoothies that day. They couldn't post a sign? Or announce that to make sure customers weren't wasting their time in that long line. I actually ordered food before attempting to order the smoothies. And had them cancel the whole order because the only reason we went was it was my daughters birthday and she really wanted a smoothie from there. If they don't respect their customers time they won't get any of my business.<//Review>

Nope. Don't go here. Both my friend and myself came here for the first time and the drinks were horribly made. Mine didn't even get mixed well (and wouldn't mix in) since they put too much brown sugar. Even at 100% (regular) sweetness, they probably put in 3x the amount needed. The boba texture and taste was really bad too. I wouldn't recommend going here at all.< /Text>

most of the experiences I've had here have been good. The boba tea is good and for a good price. One thing I do not like is that they sometimes allow a homeless man to come in and harass the customers. Other than that, the service is quick and the food tastes good.<//text>

Tried different Thai Tea's...Quickly isn't the best bit it can take my craving away when I want Thai Ice Tea and can't go out of my way to get it. It's good enough, though their menu comes with aside range of flavors< /text>

The drinks are good. Service okay. But they never ask how much sweetness and ice you want. Other places ask. Lots of choices.</review>

Their drinks aren't that great since they are a syrup based place. With only one person working behind the counter and another working in the kitchen, there is always a long wait time. The only redeeming thing about Quickly is their popcorn chicken, but that isn't enough to get me to come here. This is coming from a person who only lives 4 blocks away from here. Just go to a Union City for milk tea. Many more options.< /review>

<review>I come here for the convenient location and reasonable prices. Boba milk tea is a basic and I give it a 7.5 out of 10. The matcha green tea gets a 6. It had an akward flavor and the powder was actually in  clumps. I took a swig and found out the hard way how bitter it can be. If you're looking for boba on a budget I would recommend.<//review><date>1566953286951<//date>< name>

<review>This place is the home of my comfort food and drinks. They're not the best in town, they don't seem to be aiming for that, but they are reliable when it comes to taste. It reminds me of the times when I was in middle school, broke, and hungry. And there was nothing better than a sugar-filled jasmine milk tea that you bought with the $3 you had left. This place always lifts my spirits after a long day and the craving for boba is real. And here in Hayward this is the place. No frills, just good drinks and warm food. Anything fancier than that really doesn't fit the Hayward scene that I know.<//review>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>This Quickly has the best tasting drinks vs other Quicklys I've been to, but they are always out of the large Tapioca!! How can a Tapioca place run out?? They have poor service as well, they don't care to leave you standing in line, they wont tell you they run out until you order. I've witness many people walk out angry because they waited for nothing. Twice they have been out on large and small tapioca, that's ridiculous considering it's a Tapioca place! And the worst is that they said various times they don't recommend the small tapioca, but they offer it when they run out the large (most asked for tapioca). It just doesn't make sense! They don't apologize either! I don't get it! That was the last time I am going! After 5 consecutive times I went when I was craving them this happened!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>First and last time going here. I love boba tea and was excited to try Quickly, but no, just NO!! Everyone was so rude and the tea wasn’t even what I ordered. I regret coming here and wish I could get the last 30 minutes of my life back. The tea is bad and the “customer service” is even worse! Do yourself a favor and don’t even bother stopping here. You’ll thank me later.<//Text></record>

<user_id>115902092178490064889</user_id><text>Most cringy customer service and experience ever. While we were in line the worker(female) was helping another customer and was providing them free drinks ‘on her’. The worker also took an awful long time assisting them with just 2 drinks and had a loud nonstop conversation with them as well (as it was her friend). 10 awkward minutes later she finally greeted us and helped us. A couple minutes after, there came more of her friends which she also provided free drinks too. She told them the drinks would be free and to ‘text her’ what they wanted. While making our drinks she also had an awkward conversation with the boys about how one girl just quit because she was always calling in at quicklys and how a new girl they know is about to be hired. The new girl was apparently fu***d by one of their friends: “yeah her the one that got f***** by *****” were her words to the boys in front of us. She also kept saying bruh this bruh that out loud, non stop. Never have I felt so uncomfortable and awkward in my life. She also used a lot of bad words in Spanish, which I don’t know why she would in a work place? Calling the boys in there after us “mierda” and a bunch of other bad words and laughing at it(however the boys seemed to like it, since they knew each other). Overall very unprofessional  experience where the people there before us and after us got free drinks. I should’ve got a free drink too after hearing who had sex with who! Not professional at all👎🏻 My visit at this quicklys across Chabot College was on Friday June 8th around 9:30 pm</text>< GmapID>

I just walked out. They ran out of boba earlier today. Obviously not a completely fair review however, if you can't manage your supply of the main reason people come here... FAIL.</text>

< review>
Most of the time i go here they are ALWAYS out of fresh fruit and many other ingredients.
I just can't wrap my mind around that excuse! I mean okay if it happens once or twice but so many times i go here they are out of this and that and its kind of a dread because every other quicklys is fully stock no matter what day or how busy it is.
That is just downright unappealing and brings a damp over quicklys name.

Yeah the place is nice and all but it doesn't deter the fact that they are always giving excuses of what they are out of.

Hopefully they can turn this place around because everything else is fine except for that particular detail. But how can everything be great when they are out of it?!

Good luck and i wish the best for this business but they have to keep up their standards in how they do business and always be on top of things to keep their customers from being disappointed majority of the time</review>

Cashier was sassy and rude towards customers. Ordered lychee milk tea, gave me sesame milk tea. Gave it back, showed them the receipt, and they gave me lychee jelly instead of boba, and had to pay 50 cents to add boba. Would not recommend. Drinks are okay...</text>

First time going here with my pops and their croissants with cheese were very well made, their hot chocolate is great. Overall the service was phenomenal. Really like the mom and pops store kinda feel. Definitely going back even though my brother moved a little bit away lol<//review>

This place is awesome.  The donuts are out of sight. But the tasty cherry in top is the tamales and papusas. They're amazing!< /Review>

We also got the special were you get a tamale, drink and donut for a great price. The tamale wasn't my favorite it was missing more flavor. We did get the one that is made with cheese and jalapeños. Overall though good small place to enjoy a good cup of coffee with donut.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Quick service, good donuts, but old payment hardware. They had difficulty accepting my credit card, because its chip was slightly dislodged. Most payment terminals accept swipes after a certain number of chip read errors, but not theirs.<//Review>

What a great little shop. The staff were really friendly, greeted me with a smile and a hello, made me feel really welcome.
And it was really clean.</Review>

I  always stop here every morning for hot chocolate and a donut before heading towards my classes. The hot chocolate that is made at COC just tastes like hot milk, no flavor.</text>

I won't even give them a single star reason why two weeks ago the city and Health Inspectors made him close down for roach infestation and in mice and rats they have three days to clean it up also there was a drug addict sitting in front of the donut shops and inside the donut shops makes me feel very uncomfortable I will never go there no more due to the fact I don't know if I'll get a roach in my donut they they lost they lost me as a customer I will never go there again and I will tell my friends also the same do not go in there also also they have homeless and drug addicts in front of their store and also inside the store I don't even like walking by there no more due to the fact these people are using drugs smoking marijuana right in front of the store well my advice to people be careful when you walk by there because he's people always asking for money how we smoking marijuana taking pills also they have people sleeping at night outside the donut shop I will never step foot in that place again it made Vise two people please be careful because of drug addicts always sitting in front of their waiting for the next fix also the employees have very bad customer service they always seem to be mad and they're always talking and never seen them wash their hands after they handle money that's very nasty I will not even give him a single star<//Text>

I went to this store per my boyfriend's request because he wanted to take advantage of their dress shirt sale. He found a better discount in the back and bought two dress shirts. I was actually surprised with finding a small section for women and got a great deal on a white blouse with floral detailing on the front for $9. The cashiers at Van Heusen were friendly as well. Knocked off one star because the store was a mess.<//Text>

Love Van Heusen! I get all my office clothing from there as they have beautiful patterns and fit well at a great price.

When can Van Heusen provide online shopping??</Text>

Okie I never had a problem with vans till today. So my classmates bday is next month, and since me and my other classmates are like the best classmates ever, we decided to get her a thoughtful gift, the black and white checkered vans. However, since we are just some broke seventh graders, it is quite difficult for us to afford, considering it is $50 ($55 with tax). Therefore, we just wanted a single shoe, (only the left or right). In this situation, we only wanted the right shoe. This is because our classmate somehow lost her right shoe at school (she has the checkered vans in black and grey). So, we decided if she were to lose her right shoe again she’d have a backup. We also came to the conclusion that the black and white vans are extremely basic. This is a crucial part in why we wanted it, since our classmate thinks she’s not basic, even though she only wears gap and her vans. She enjoys calling other people basic as well. For her birthday, we wanted the guy she likes to ask her out by proposing to her with one shoe. We decided that if we weren’t allowed to do this that we will get two single shoes in seperate sizes, (one in six for our classmate, and one in nine for her soon to be boyfriend, as like a “congrats y’all are dating” gift). So, we went up to the cashier and asked her if we were purchase the shoes as so. She replied in an extremely rude voice, and looked at us as if we were some mentally ill kids, as well as asking us why we would need that, (which isn’t right since that isn’t her place to ask). She looked like she really wasn’t in the mood to be there. So in the end, we payed for a pair of black and white checkered vans size six. We might have to sell our houses after this since this gift was so expensive. I am extremely dissapointed in the quality of vans customer service.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Large warehouse with many of its products.
It looks good supply of sports shoes, of course skaters trend.
The prices still do not convince me much and I hope they improve them, because it is an oulet.

(Original)
Gran almacén con muchos de sus productos.
Se ve buena oferta de calzado deportivo, por supuesto de tendencia de los patinadores.
Los precios aún no me convencen mucho y espero que los mejoren, pues se trata de un oulet.</review><gmap_id>0x808fceb5eb5cebf7:0xc06bc03c61a693ad<//gmap_id>< user>

< Review>
After a billing problem with Anytime Fitness they called personally to resolve the issue and were helpful. They are working to fix the issue, if this has happened to you, reach out to them again.
I don't attend the gym anymore because I moved away. The gym staff is nice and provides good in person fitness services.</Review>

The gym is great. From the equipment to the staff & trainers and even the members themselves. Anything you want and need Anytime has it all. Most of all they don't try and sell you on something you don't need. So if you're there to lose weight, bodybuild, cross-train or even to just be as healthy as you can be, Anytime has got you. After searching for a gym for a while I'm extremely happy to have found Anytime.</Text>

<time>1599703309776<//time><rate>1</rate><Review>Joke of a gym only lets members of this specific location workout and wanted to charge me some ridiculous amount for a membership for their tiny jail yard workout area even though I am an Anytime Fitness member already. In fact, I was here on March 16 at 1 am working out, the only person there, when the owner or someone along those lines walked in and apologized profusely telling me that Garcetti had ordered all gyms to close, so they would have to close until March 31. Last member here before the closure, but I'm not allowed to workout here now that they "reopened." In any case, despite the generous offer of one complimentary workout at a gym which I am a member of, I just left because there was so little equipment.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>2nd UPDATE:

It looks like this location is STILL charging me. At this point the charges will be disputed and I will be asking for a new card from my bank. I had initially updated my review as I thought we fixed this issue but it seems Anytime Fitness does not have honest business protocols in place, and I would proceed with extreme caution when signing up with them. I tried to be reasonable but clearly they're thieves and will continue to withdrawal money from your account even after they noted it was cancelled and that they would no longer charge me. HELLA SHADY BUSINESS!
----------
When COVID19 hit I had asked to cancel my membership. I'm someone who has a higher risk of catching COVID due to asthma. I reached out and was first told that I couldn't cancel due to being in a contract until Dec. I believe I was emailing with the owner who was probably trying to figure out next steps since no one was expecting a pandemic. I get that and I thought we cleared everything as it was noted applying "free time" to accounts. I just now received charges for this gym and I have 0 communication from them about updates on their policy with all this COVID madness. I have NO plans returning to alot of places that can be done at home such as a gym and we have not stepped foot in that gym since the pandemic. No offense but I don't quite trust using most public services that aren't necessary until sometime in thefuture (if at all) given my risk factor. We'll see if Anytime Fitness does the right thing as I've reached back out again for a refund and cancellation. I'll be providing an update.< /Text></record>

How refreshing!! I joined and I’m hooked! The sign up process was so easy and definitely pressure free (unlike other gym experiences I’ve had) all they cared about was what I wanted and needed to reach my fitness goal. Nick the general manager is probably the most knowledgeable personal trainer i know and I’ve had so many in the past! I feel like I’m working out with a trainer and physical therapist at the same time! I love the private showers (even though I haven’t  used them yet it’s nice to know there there), love the fact I can go literally anytime and it’s so bright and the energy there is just amazing! Love my new GYM! Go Anytime Fitness!</review>

I’ve been to many gyms in the LA area. And Anytime Fitness Culver City is the nicest gym I’ve been to by far. It’s very clean and the equipment is very nice and new. The atmosphere is awesome and I love that the fact the gym is 24/7. The trainers are also very knowledgeable and motivating. Love this gym!<//Text>

It’s clean, I go on off hours and there is almost no one there.  I have a gym membership through my work so it’s very very cheap for me so I can’t speak to fees.  (Talk to your job about getting Active and Fit direct ;))

No lockers, just cubbies. And private bathrooms are nice! I like this place! Parking is  kind of a hassle even though there is a lot, many businesses use it, but I walk so that doesn’t bother me.< /review>

Awesome addition to the Anytime Fitness portfolio. This club was a previous private training and group training club, and it has now been fully remodeled and now offers everything that was there before, and more! Open 24/7, private bathrooms and showers, super clean, and great selection of equipment. And it's the ONLY 24/7 gym in Culver City. 5-STARS!!!</Text>

This review is specifically about the Small Group Training (SGT) at the Culver City Anytime Fitness location.  First off, the SGT is expensive.  BUT...it is completely worth it!  Usually there are only two or three other individuals participating in a given group and it feels as if you have a personal trainer.  I have been participating in SGT for several months with Cruz and he is fantastic!  Cruz will structure the one-hour workout to your ability level and continue to push you past what you think are your limits.  He has increased my knowledge about pre-workout warm ups and full body exercise routines (with and without weights).  I have been very active in fitness for two decades and am happy to have Cruz push me hard in every workout.  Over the past several months these workouts have added a jolt to my fitness level and motivation.

My recommendation is to sign up for a set package of 2 SGTs per week and then apply what you learn to your other workouts during the week.  This is especially relevant to the exercises you learn for abs.

A note about the facility: they recently remodeled this gym and it is very nice!  It doesn't have a dedicated setup for power lifting, but the power racks are usually available if you want to do dead lifts or power cleans.<//text>

<Review>Most of the staff were pleasant and helpful. The space is private with a variety of options for it's size. And seemed to be a perfect fit except for my biggest drawback:

One of their employees a tall blonde decided to film in the area where the public was working out without any sort of consent. Once I noticed her filming I would go to a different area to workout. What topped it off is when we left my wife told me that she heard her complaining to her co-worker about me being in her shot while facing a wall of mirrors! So it seems as though one of their employees has it backwards if anyone should be complaining shouldn't it be me?<//Review>< Pics>

Friendly but be very very very careful with this branch. There are a lot of hidden fees that they don't tell you verbally. The lowest price will not be 39.99 a month but might be $80 per month because they will keep hitting your account repeatly(especially if you don't pay attention).

Today, I talked to a Nick and he pretty much implied that I should have read the contract. I did and it seemed clear. I guess it was not clear enough. But? I should have listened to my intuition when they kept trying to push extra fees and additional training on me on the first day when I kept telling them that I could not afford it. I don't TRUST this company and it has only been 2 months. Lesson learned. This is my worst experience with a gym(money wise...like I said they were very nice but the money thing makes the whole thing worse. It makes them look sneaky.)<//text>

Such a huge disappointment with too many hidden fees and money hungry staff that try to pressure you into their fitness packages ($160/month for 1x week group training or $560/month for 1x a week personal training). I really wanted to like this place, but signing up for here was a huge mistake!! I kept receiving unauthorized charges to my card for fitness packages which were canceled and never used because after being talked into them by 3 different staff members, felt it was not within my budget. Nick, the manager was IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of, avoiding my calls (hoping I’d forget or let it go) or always “busy”. When we finally did get in contact, weeks of going back and forth, he promised the charges would be reversed on my card. New charges continued to appear on my card...Ultimately had to get my credit card company involved and report fraudulent charges. Thankfully that took care of things. I  was looking for a local gym, a family, and fun place to work out. This was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had!! Definitely avoid this place, it’s not worth the hassle, the hidden charges ($60 club enhancement fee lol) and all the other ridiculous issues I had to deal with.< /Text>

<review>I joined a month ago and they took out about three times the fee from my bank account wrongly.  I’ve been trying to get the credit back for three weeks.   Nothing but “don’t worry”... indeed, Nick apologizes that it was Kim’s first time signing someone up.   He lied about asking for the credit and then said he had to talk to the “owners”. I am not pleased that I have to resort to social media to get my money back....<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is spacious. The building is new and the facilities are enriched. There were only two shower stalls, but it was fine.

<review>I wish they had an option for 6, 7 or 8 stars.  First, the service was unbelievably good.  John not only was helpful and attentive, but he made fantastic suggestions and guided us to an amazing meal.

The sushi was amazing.  At John's suggestion I had the New Zealand and Scottish salmon nigiri to start and then a series of specially rolls.  I'm not usually a big fan of rolls because I feel like some places hide interior ingredients in there.  Not the case here.  All of the rolls were well balanced and delicious. If you're in the area, don't miss this unassuming little place!</review><name>John Hine< /name>< date>

<text>I have been coming to Zushi Puzzle regularly for 12+ years now. And unlike so many places where quality or creativity takes a hit after a while, Roger continues to serve what I believe are some of the most creative, freshest and highest quality dishes in the Bay Area. Not limited to sushi restaurants - among any restaurants. Every visit is an exceptional experience, but if you have time to plan ahead, try to reserve some of the limited seating at the bar. Enjoy!!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlTiZ8qoyEO0Me1Vf-X77ZQLTAyzneXI0WXj8M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><username>Ingo Bednarz< /username><Response>None</Response>< Rate>

I thought that it wouldn't be half as amazing as Sugarfish  (even though it's the same owner ) but it definitely surpassed my expectations! Tried the 5 different handrolls here and my absolute favorite was the signature Nozawa blue crab hand roll. I also love how they have sake out of jars.  Super cute. Oh and tip is included :)</Review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Pics>

Best sushi in the city (if you’re sitting at the bar). This man is a legend, and I’m always blown away by the flavors, freshness and quality of his selections. Don’t be fooled by the humble look of the restaurant, I’ve lived in japan for many years, and this is some of the finest sushi in the world.

Thank you Rodger< /text>

<text>Hidden sushi place that has probably the best salmon nigiri I've had in SF. Handrolls are also great. Punches way above it's price! The servers are super sweet and will recognize you if you go often. Ask them for help ordering if you want to try something new!</text>< Pics>

This place was the best. The sushi is so fresh that fresh itself got put out of business. The service is a little slow, and it does smell a little fishy like as in fish, but overall the fish is amazing! It melts in your mouth and not on your chopsticks. Fancy but not to fancy, and it is inexpensive which is great on a Friday night when the family is tired. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi restaurant.<//text>

<Review>Large menu of maki, but unfortunately they used wayyyyy to much rice in their rolls. We did try their handrolls too which is definitely the move if you don't want to eat more rice than fish.< /Review><Name>Brittany Oakes<//Name><time>1572215710391<//time><resp>None< /resp>< UserId.>

< Review>
One of the best meals I’ve had. Chef Rodger has a non intimidating sushi bar where he carries the conversation, asks likes and dislikes, and provides some of the best hand crafted sushi you’ll have. So much dedication and thought goes to the ingredients and technique, and it comes thru in everything you eat. Came on a friends recommendation and while there I could see why Rodger has a little cult following. Amazing.

For the best experience sit in the sushi bar and let chef take over. Didn’t take many pics, was busy eating, but here is a trumpet fish head. Also had uni from Japan, monk fish liver, roe, toro, and a bunch of seasonal things that depending on how he prepared changed the entire taste and experience. Mind blow and thankful for the good meal.<//Review>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Good sushi, weird seating policies. Had dinner there a couple of nights ago. Upon arrival the host asked us if we had a reservation. We said no and he put a concerned look on his face despite about half the tables being empty. He then grabbed his clipboard and made a show of walking through the really small dining area alternatively looking at his clipboard and the seated tables. He came back to us and told us we could be seated despite the lack of a reservation. This stuck us as a bit funny but we thought maybe a big group was coming in shortly and wrote it off. We then watched this same scenario play out a number of times over the course of our meal despite the restaurant never getting full. By the time we left he actually had 3 parties standing in the foyer waiting even though there were plenty of tables available. Sushi and the rolls were really good though and combined with host's clipboard dinner theater you can enjoy a nice evening.</review>< Pictures>

I think this place is a bit overrated. They used way too much rice in their rolls. The fish is excellent quality but none of the Maki rolls were impressive. This place would be 3 stars if it wasn't for the high quality of the fish.

Staff was very friendly and attentive.<//review>

<review>While the decor leaves something to be desired, the quality of the fish is the best in the city. The rolls are very creative and have great flavor. Another great thing is the freshly ground wasabi. You can really taste the difference between this and what most other sushi restaurants save< /review>< pictures>

At the back of this  unassuming restaurant is a bar manned by Roger, the upbeat chef who will detail everything you are about to eat, with stories, facts and even instructions on how to get the best taste with every bite. I had the Omakase and though it is quite expensive ($100/person) you can ask for a smaller budget. This was truly the best Sushi experience I have ever had. Plate after plate I was amazed at what Roger can do. I was beyond satisfies at the end, having gone to new places with sushi. This will become a staple whenever I am in town, it is absolutely an amazing experience. Make sure to make reservations if you want space at the bar, there are only 8 seats.<//Review>

<Review>This place has an excellent happy hour, and I totally recommend it!

I came here instead of Naked Fish on a Tuesday night (my boyfriend and I always go to Naked Fish and wanted to try something different).  It was completely empty except for us two, and the sushi was good.  The emptiness was a bit alarming as this is should be a popular sushi spot in the marina.

But the sushi was good, and was well priced!  I recommend coming here for happy hour.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I went to Zushi Puzzle based on the great reviews but was very let down after eating there. The restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived but our appetizers (gyoza and tempura) took an extremely long time to come out and we didn’t get them until after our meal had arrived.

The sushi we ordered was terrible. Fish did not taste fresh and was warm. I couldn’t tell if it was because the rice used in the sushi rolls was hot or if the fish was not being stored at the proper temperature, but either way it was not good.

Two people at our table ordered teriyaki instead of sushi (one chicken and one steak). The steak teriyaki was sent back because it did not taste right. When the waitress was informed that we wanted to send back the teriyaki because it tasted bad, the waitress said that it looked like it was cooked perfectly and nothing was wrong with it. About 5 minutes later she came back and offered to swap the steak teriyaki for chicken.

Overall the food was disappointing and it took over two hours for us to eat because the food was so slow to come out. The restaurant was very dirty and dingy. The bathrooms were dirty and the soap looked disgusting (as if it had been sitting there since the restaurant opened). I’m not sure if something was off the night we ate here but I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and will not be returning.< /text>

<Text>I made a reservation to sit at the sushi bar, as I wanted the full experience. Upon arrival no one greeted us. Apparently you have to be rude and approach THEM to tell them you want to eat. A couple that arrived after us were seated first, and the waiter told me that they were just waiting for a couple from the first seating to finish up. We waited. And waited. And waited. Finally after an hour we agreed to sit at in the dining room at a regular table. By way of apology, the waiter bought us a beer and said, "People work hard to earn their money, and we can't tell them to leave if they want to have a good meal." Really? I flew in from Brooklyn that day and wanted to have a good meal. The food was good and fresh but that experience ruined it for me.<//Text><time>1359666968330<//time></record></dataset><record>

If you are ever in the area this place is a must go.  The special on the first night I went was called The Best Made Hand Roll.  Not only was it actually the best made hand roll, it was one of the best things I have ever eating.  This place is also a great value for the amount and quality of sushi you get.  Go for omakase if you want a good variety.< /Text>< Response>

You know what... this place is really good!

I think, as others have noted, service is not a top priority here.... but don't worry, the food is great, and is very inventive (but old stand-bys are executed perfectly too).

Go for it... highly recommended!< /review>

You have to make phone reservations or else you may have a long wait or not even get a table. We arrived for our 7pm reservation and I had wanted to sit at the bar but there weren't enough chairs for my party of two. If you can get a seat there, you will get a great show my the sushi chef which would up your experience. They have a great selection of fresh fish from Japan on their daily menu. The waiters also try to guide you through the menu but they aren't necessarily too helpful. We ordered some sushi rolls, sashimi, and handrolls. We also got the "best hand roll" as we were told it was the signature best. The main component of that roll was the crab, and I have to say it was pretty good. But I would say the food overall was mind blowing. It was good for a sushi place. But one thing that chips away from the rating is the Chinese staff as you would expect more authentic Japanese food to be served by the Japanese.<//Review>

<text>I'll start with the decor...since it was my low point on the rating.  But who cares?  You're not going here for the decor.  You're going for the amazing sushi!  It's awesome!  I love his creativity, the quality of his fish, and basically everything about it.  The only issue... parking around here can be a bit of a nightmare.

Go for the omakase.  He'll know what to serve you.  One of my top sushi spots in SF!</text>< Pictures>

Good sushi at a reasonable price.

I've only ever ordered rolls here so I can't comment on the omakase or the other food. That said, the rolls here are large and filling, the fish tastes fresh, and the price is right.

Salmon lover? Check out the salmon killer roll!</Review>

Probably one of the best sushi restaurants in San Francisco (that's affordable). I love the Best Handroll Ever, its has soft shell crab, cucumbers, rice, and some type of magical sauce. The fish here is extremely fresh with a ton of daily selection to choose from. I always get the toro, which is delicate and perfectly fatty. I would recommend reservations. If you’re adventurous, you can make a reservation at the sushi bar and the chef gives you whatever they have for the day.< /Review>

I cannot recommend Zushi Puzzle enough! Their Omakase experience is amazing. I'll start by saying make sure if you would like to try the Omakase that you have a reservation. It's typically very full, so call ahead to make sure you have a spot. Chef Roger and his team of sous chefs are so much fun! Making the experience that much better! They really listen to their customers to customize the experience they are having. In fact another couple was having a birthday there and they picked up on that without being explicitly told. It's the small things that count.

Regarding the food, AMAZING! The small truffle additions to some of the nigiri was perfect. I've never had truffle on sushi before but I highly recommend trying it. The uni was very unique as well, I believe chef Roger is known for a special sushi dish with uni on it. The fish was amazing and he talked about sourcing fish and the different kinds throughout our meal, even educating us on how to eat sushi (make sure the fish is down so you get that flavor first). We had a special request for Kobe beef as well and of course he delivered! It was amazing!

Dessert was the most unique ever as well. He had a Kobe beef ice cream and similar savory but sweet ice creams. It sounds a bit unnerving but it was so smooth, creamy and flavorful (enough for the few bites given for dessert).

The price tag is a bit high, but not too high for a special occasion or fun night out. I highly recommend Zushi Puzzle and I will certainly be back if I'm in San Francisco again.<//Text>

If you go here you have to sit at the sushi bar.  Roger the owner and resident sushi chef is fantastic and he can make almost anything.  Although this place might not have the decor of some of the hipper sushi joints, this place has the most unique and uniquely prepared seafood in the city.< /text>

The omakase here is amazing. The chef is extremely friendly and loves to explain where each type of fish comes from. I highly recommend this place for all occasions (Family, Dates, and just normal friend outings). Remember to make reservations early and go only to the sushi bar because that's the only experience that's worth it at this place in my opinion.<//Review>

<Review>Decided to 'pop' in here after a recommendation from a friend of a friend. Sitting at the bar is the way to go. Not that the service at our table wasn't great, but the master chef making us whatever sushi he felt like was an experience.

We were sat after a short wait in the dining area, and we kindly asked one of the servers if there was any chance a spot at the bar would open up, he secretly kept an eye on it for us, and the moment he saw a couple moving out, he offered us the vacant bar seat.

Once seated, we went through a flight of various fish cuts from all around the world. I made it a purpose to try everything (and I enjoyed it all), even the baby squid, which was delicious!

Will be on my list of 'stops' next time in the Bay Area, highly recommend the establishment.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Some of the best sashimi I have had. The Rainbow roll is also quite good. Small restaurant so quite busy during normal dinner hours. If you go around 9:30pm on a weekday there shouldn't be any wait.< /Text>

Staff is Chinese, (one would expect Japanese in a sushi restaurant) restaurant is extremely dirty, bathroom is unhygienic, but chef Roger is unique, and most of the fish is fresh from the day, the fish in the fridge did not look good, it was not properly wrap in plastic... Scary!! Roger was serving some of that fish to client sitting in the restaurant, I ate at the bar and had a wonderful experience, he was cutting fresh fish for us, I ordered some sushis and Roger was over serving pieces (order one red snapper, served 3 different ones) and add some sashimis,  I did not order, i did not ask for omakase either, told me you have to taste the salmon you have to taste this... It was good indeed! When check arrive it was over $240. Roger told me: you ate a lot!!<//text>

<Review>My favorite sushi place in my hood. Zushi puzzle has a great selection of fish you never see at most sushi places. Like ivory sake? Never had it, and it was awesome. They also had different types of toro and like 4 types of sake. They even had live uni, which I usually don't like but coming around now. They have something called the best handroll, and I probably would have to agree. Get that as well.

Good suggestion is to do chef's choice and sit at the sushi bar. Make sure to make reservations as this place gets real busy on most nights.</Review>< Rate>

I Love Zushi Puzzle! If you want a great sushi place in the marina/russian hill/cow hollow district - you must try this!
MUST order:
- Best Hand Roll: I wish they made this into an actual roll
- Any roll with Butterfish</Text>

< Review>
Sit at the bar, tell the chef what you want, and you probably won't be disappointed.  I had a fantastic sushi meal here.  It ran me $85 for dinner (including two beers), so it's not for the faint of budget, but it's also not insane like a Nobu Sushi.  That said, the decor is quite casual, unlike a Nobu.<//Review>

This is our favorite sushi restaurant in SF.  They fly their fish in from all over the world, especially Japan.  Depending on the season, they have 5-8 different types of salmon. Rolls are great as well.

You'll most likely need a reservation unless you come right when they open, but even then I've seen them turn people away.

You can also special order fish from Japan in advance.  A table near us did this and spent over 4k on their complete meal for 4. That's how high end of fish this place can serve if you request it in advance.

For us normal people with a normal budget, zushi puzzle is a reasonably priced with most Nigiri between 5 and 13 dollars.  Rolls are priced from 6-20 depending on size.

The chef Roger is awesome and is rated one of America's Best Chefs.  If you sit at the bar and do omikaze,  he'll ask you what you like and don't like and will make sure you enjoy everything he makes you. He's got a great wit as well!</text>

Sit at the bar for the omakase fed by Roger for one of the best sushi experiences in the city.  Or just sit at the table for great sushi rolls, good value sake, and generally good service.</Review>

They don't have an online reservation system but be sure to call in and make a reservation since seating is limited(you do not want to attempt to walk in and expect to be seated within an hour). The head sushi chef Roger is very knowledgeable and friendly. Try the "Best Handroll" that comes with softshell crab and spicy tuna. Its conveniently located on Lombard St which gives you access to many bars in the area on Union St or Chestnut St.< /Review>< Pictures>

Zushi puzzle doesn't focus on the atmosphere, but has a unique selection of fresh  fish and sushi roles. My recommendation is to ask for suggestions from the chef and stick with what he suggests.<//Review>

Really great small (and somewhat hidden) sushi place in the Marina district that's actually fairly reasonably priced. This is one of the surprisingly rare places to offer Walu sashimi (one of my favorites types) and it's very fresh and tasty along with the rest of its sashimi lineup. Also features some pretty high-quality rolls: my favorites include the Romeo and Juliet roll and the Anniversary roll. Definitely recommended if you have a hankering for some sushi but don't want to spend a fortune.<//text>

<text>The omakase is a must. Chef Roger only does 2 seatings a night (6:30 and 8:30) at the bar/chef's table in the back of the restaurant. You will need a reservation, but it's usually not too hard for a weekday. Chef Roger has the freshest fish, and his talents made our anniversary meal amazing! We went through at least 16 courses, but our main sashimi plate was INCREDIBLE. Even the presentation was beautiful!

Chef Rogar is really friendly, but if you would prefer only a few fancy rolls to the omakase experience, the bar may not be the best place. It took us 2 hours to enjoy the full experience, and although it was pricey, well worth the money! We'll definitely be coming more often!</text>< pictures>

Not the prettiest restaurant, but the sushi was great.  Gotta get the Best Hand roll.  It's deep fried soft shell crab wrapped in soy paper.  We also ordered the unagi lover, the Salesforce roll and the sashimi platter.  The rolls were solid, though not particularly unique.  I did appreciate the tenderness of the sashimi in our platter.  We had albacore, salmon, and hamachi.< /review>

Oh my god. OH MY GOD!!! One of my favorite meals in SF and maybe in life. Must get omakase at the bar with Roger. He loves and respects food like nobody's business. If you want to eat boring rolls don't come here. If you want a sushi culinary journey then come sit at the bar.

Highlights:
Best handroll
Four kinds of toro
Kobe beef sushi with foie gras
Sweet shrimp and ankimo shavings
His epic ice cream made with KOBE BEEF FAT (its actually delicious)
Fresh scallop sushi
Uni and tofu
Pretty much...everything. Just trust in Roger.

Note: omakase is gonna cost a pretty penny, but better than most 1-2 Michelin seafood places for sure!<//Review>

< Review>
We made reservations and were seated right away by courteous staff and were given complementary edamame which was a nice touch. We ordered salads, two different sushi rolls and a 10 piece of the Chef's choice sashimi. The sushi rolls were good but average. They tasted fresh and tasty but were not anything exceptional at all and we've definitely had better. The sashimi, however, was out of this world. We have never had sashimi so fresh and delicious. If we lived in the area all the time, we'd frequent Zushi puzzle all the time just for their sashimi. Overall, we had a good experience at a very fair price.<//Review>

We also ordered the unagi lover, the Salesforce roll and the sashimi platter.  The rolls were solid, though not particularly unique.  I did appreciate the tenderness of the sashimi in our platter.  We had albacore, salmon, and hamachi.< /text>< pics>

Just ordered for the first time. Added an imperial roll to my dish and it’s officially the most poorly done roll I’ve come across. It tastes chalky like there are no essential ingredients in the roll.< /Text>

Really sad because I used to really like this place because of the garlic noodles. The stars you do get is for the garlic noodles.

We ordered the chicken salad and pho as well. Pho isn't anything to write home about. The garlic noodles with chicken was good but all the chicken in all our dishes were super dry. Like dry and hard. Like hurting my esophagus on its way down, hard.

One of the saddest thing is our salad was bitter. I thought it was just the cucumber and avoided it but something in there was bitter. It's sad because it's just a salad. It was supposed to bring me the freshness in the piles of meat we were gonna eat. I feel like maybe some of the basic prep work was skipped. Like milking a cucumber before you chop it up.

I don't normally do this, especially during COVID, but I literally was scrapping the salad out of my mouth with my hands because it couldn't get the taste out of my mouth quick enough.<//Text>

The curry ramen is outstanding. The curry has a full taste, with just the right amount of spicy for my liking. One comment from my family - "this is the best curry ramen I have had." (the comparison is the noodle place in Stonestown Galleria).

Service is fast and friendly. Parking is hit or miss.<//review>

Great pho!! And decently priced. You can order up to an extra large for $10.95. This was the #24- round eye steak with their sate sauce. Nice and spicy!</Text>

Michael and the rest of the staff are awesome, very friendly and welcoming. There's a great beer selection, the beef pho is awesome and the garlic chicken is off the chain. Great local spot, relaxed and casual!</text>

OMG this food is delicious and such great value! Very friendly and helpful staff. The curried chicken pho is absolutely amazing - and very filling! The fresh spring rolls are gorgeous too. Such an unassuming place with seemingly large number of takeout / delivery orders leads e to thinks it’s a local favourite - and understandably so! Very highly recommended for cheap and cheerful Vietnamese in Lower Haight!</review>

Surprisingly good pho. If they had served it with a platter of side salads to go with pho and a bit more meat this would be a 5-Star meal.<//text>

Very bad food delivered through Doordash. Ordered the beef combo soup, not even sure you can call it a Pho.. The broth was bland and tasteless, no condiments had been provided (thai basil, sprouts, hoisin, sriracha etc.), the glass noodles were ok, and the few pieces of beef were tiny. Overall not enough to call it a meal...<//review>

<Review>I don't like writing bad reviews, but my pick up experience was very below par. Most importantly this place is overpriced we were charged 12+5 for vegetable pho with beef. Forgetting to package chopsticks with a pho, and only packaging two packets of sauces for a large order is poor service. So many better places to get pho.. avoid.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I ordered satay veggie pho - the menu indicates there’s fried tofu, there wasn’t any tofu in my meal. I also ordered the milk tea which has boba in the photo, there wasn’t any boba in my drink. It was also 30 minutes late. The food seemed good but the order was wrong.<//review>< Pictures>

this is the best mental health service i’ve ever received. i finally found a psychiatrist that actually listens to me and took the time to diagnose me and to prescribe me the right medication and the best part is that it’s all free! so grateful for the experience i’ve gotten from here and for the ongoing service i am receiving!< /Text>

<text>Dr. Johnny Moyer is amazing!!!!! Never have I ever been so satisfied and taken care of by a provider. When I first came to dr. Moyer, I was in bad shape. He helped improve my health tremendously!!!  His assistant Jose is quite amazing as well. They make an amazing team.< /text>< pics>

I'm very pleased with the services provided at San Fernando Community Health Center. I'm currently seeing Dr Aura Veliz she's basically the reason why I started coming to this health center. I've Know Dr Veliz for many years, she's been my Dr for 3 of my previous pregnancies, this will be my 4th baby with her and she is truly amazing. I took me a while to find since she left her previous location. I went through facebook, linked and many other social media sites, I was able to finally find her through google search and I'm so thankful and happy I did. She's professional, caring and always makes you feel that you matter as a patient. Her stuff is like her and I'm very happy to her patient. If there's anyone else looking for her you can find @ 732 Mott St Suite 100-110, San Fernando, CA 91240.<//text>

The clinic has been nothing but kind, caring, and helpful. Every need I can think of has been met and has surpassed my expectations everytime. I'm originally from New York, and you don't get this kind of quality service on the East Coast. I highly recommend this location!<//Review>

I love Dr. Solarte he's been seen my baby since she was born.
I love that he is bilingual in Spanish & English. Answers all my questions. Waiting time this visit was very good. I was in and out of the office in 1 hour.</Review>

I was referred here after a visit to the ER for an allergic reaction. The staff were extremely accommodating, considering I asked for a same day appointment and they were able to help me within a few hours. I also changed my plan so I could become a patient here, and I’m very happy I did so. I can’t wait to come here for future appointments!< /Text>

Since the moment that I called San Fernando Community Clinic everything went very smoothly, I made the appt for a physical and vaccinations for my Grandson they made me next day appt with no problems, they sent me a confirmation email with the date, time and address and map and easy to find on my GPS, all the Nurses were very helpful, professional and polite, the Clinic is very clean from the entrance to the visit room and parking lot the environment were very pleasant, the Dr was very professional and friendly with my Grandson... overall I'm 100% + satisfied and I'll recommend this clinic to my family and friends, thanks so much to all the staff of San Fernando Community Clinic 😀👍</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I have to say I haven’t had not one bad experience coming to this place. I come here very constant more than I would like but because of my health. Appointments are available within one week. I’ve been to other places and usually takes a couple weeks and even a month to get an appointment. My primary Doctor is John but I have delt with two other doctors there & all seemed to be fully educated & very thoughtful. Receptionist are very helpful & nice, they speak both English & Spanish.  When arriving to place very clean and have many seat available to sit. Would definitely recommended this place. If your going to a different clinic I really recommend you call your provider to assign you to this clinic as I did 👍</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
A lot has improved in the last couple of months, desk is polite doctors are informative and caring. I have been bringing my daughter here since her first check up. Doctor Solarte is awesome I no longer live close to this clinic but I still travel 18 miles because I trust him and he’s informative. The facility is clean expect to be here for an hour to hour and a half if you’re a first time patient. The nurses are amazing and most of the time you see the same one in every visit which is great! Scheduling is easy and they try to work on your schedule and convenience.< /Review>

Even when I have had problems or issues with scheduling, running late, or switching appointments, they have always been helpful and nice. Dr. Folmsbee is a very easy going Doctor Who answers all of your questions and also gives you information about all the things he is doing and why. Very easy to talk and interact with.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Aura (don't know if I spelled it right) but she is also as caring, sweet, and attentive Dr. That has treated me for urgent needs. I really like this clinic idk her name but one young woman from the front desk is also nice. I forgot her name. She only speaks English.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I’m a home care worker and was bringing my patient too see his doctor. A lady walks in with a nasty gash on her finger. I mean it was bad! I immediately made her go in front of me in line and they totally ignored the situation and had her step back. It’s been about 45min now and this lady is obviously in pain. This really upset me and I spoke up and told the front desk and was basically ignored also. I felt like this needed  to be posted!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Amazing staff! Lady behind desk always answer my questions respond quickly they always book me. I struggle with a lot of pain and anxiety so I’ll never know when I need to book but I’m able to meet with primary doctor without waiting long time. They are such caring people. Free transportation!! Is perfect for me cause I cannot drive due to my anxiety. Dr. Johnny Moyer gives me my referral right away not just any referral he actually research look up what services that doctor will do with whatever I’m struggling with or if I need a test done. He is nicest doctor I’ve had this far. My medical covers it all. I’m currently seeing psychiatrist on computer hopefully he can give me right medication to treat my unbearable anxiety pain. Hopefully this type doctor help me when I hafdfurire children< /Text><user_id>114687782200103373059< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2904c30ed90d1:0x698bd18694de1cea<//gmap_id>< date>

Indebted for life. This organization not only helped me take care of my elderly mom with her complex dental needs but myself and husband. We have been patients there for over 15 years. We have always been treated with the utmost care and professionalism. They are there to help those in need and for those who need it at specific difficult times. Thank you UCLA Dental!< /Text>

The doctors office is great but the after hours people that you talk to over the phone are rude ! I just called and couldn’t understand clearly what the man was saying and he started giving me attitude then hung up on me before i could even give him my name
Like how he asked . So very disappointed . The doctors are nice and receptionist but after hours customer service is horrible.</text>

In and out is quick, but a big lady in the office is very rude. Be careful, don't spoil your day with the lady's bad attitude.</review>

Got thrown out cause I spoke up! They were saying that I was late for my 3am appointment but I had been told by dispatch and broker that it was for an 5am appointment and they said that it was a 4am appointment and they were going to change a lumper fee and I said that it was bull that everyone I come here they always come up with an excuse to charge and they told me to park in the street so basically I got kick out of their warehouse for speaking up!!!!<//Text>

<Text>Receiving opened at three am. Arrived 0315 for 400 appt. Sent to door immediately. Lots of room. Go see lumpers by door 27.
Unloaded immediately, out by 0445. Full trailer one item. Sorting many would obviously take longer.
One of the best So Cal experiences I've had. Good staff as well.</Text>< GmapID>

Great customer service at this Chevron gas station and convenience store in Fontana, CA. They even have diesel fuel and an air and water station. The gas pumps are clean and the squeegee stations are full of water and there are towels at every station.

They also have an extra mile convenience store which always has their shelves fully stocked with merchandise.</review>

When I first walked in, I was greeted by a Very Nice and Polite Gentleman (that is what the one star is form)

The rest of the experience was just bad

We were driving quite a distance so we wanted to pack up with water, we told the lady in the counter that if she could ring up two waters, In a really rude tone she said "You have to bring them up" we didn't like her tone or the faces that she was making but we said fine, and that we will bring them later when we were done shopping ( I guess that the other gas station spoil us) lol but we understood that

So then the Scratchers catch my eye, I point at two different ones and when she brought them to bring it up she asked me for my Id ( I am over 21 lol) but I forgot my Id, which it was fine, I can understand that she needed an Id, My friend said that he was going to pay for them, but she told him that he needed to choose them (keep in mind that she was telling all of this to us in a very rude manner) so he did he pointed at the ones he wanted and she once again told him no that those were the same kind that I choose? would it make a difference if he choose those? those will be new tickets anyway? but yeah I can get her point but she was just so mean, why would a person be this rude for such a small issue? this is the first time we have tried to buy these, it's not like we know automatically

If she was nice with us we would have stayed and not buy any tickets but we would have purchased many snacks for the road, water, and even jack in the box.... but since she was rude it was different, no way would we give this location our business anymore

Maybe if the Gentleman attended us, it would have been different, most of the customer's were lining up to his side, like if they knew<//Text>

It is your typical gas station with a mini mart and connected fast food. Nothing special, but nothing wrong either.<//review>

One star because one time i fell outside and someone saw me. It was embarrassing. However, they typically have low gas prices.<//text>

Small grocery store with a great selection of high quality meats. Produce is limited. Good wine selection. Everything is pretty pricey though. Staff is very friendly and helpful.</text>

<rating>5</rating><text>It is great to go into a market where everyone knows you name. That was what life was like before the tradeoff of price for service left us searching isles for help. For my money and they do get my money, Harvest Ranch Market is a shop where you feel good walking in. It is a friendly experience and you can find almost anything you are looking for. Get to know the manager John Barbat and the staff in the deli and meat/fish counter and you will get their picks for the day (although the meatballs and enchiladas are always worth the trip).
During Covid-19 every extra service has been happily offered including shopping and delivery to the trunk of your car when you pull up. It all adds to the value of being a loyal customer and enjoying the environment of the Mom and Pops that once lined America's main streets. So, with thanks to John for keeping me safe (and always finding enough TP). I recommend that you enjoy your experience at Harvest Ranch and keep a local treasure prosperous.<//text>< pics>

Starving and on my way from Encinitas to Escondido, I decided to stop and have fresh food instead of fast food. It was later in the evening, close to their closing so I didn’t expect they’d want to go to much trouble.... but instead the sweetheart guy behind the counter John “A”, made me the best tasting, thinly sliced and juicy, roast beef sandwich on a fresh roll served up with fresh homemade chips and a pickle, the size that could possibly feed two, if but oh no....YEP, I ate it all in one sitting!
This is definitely a beautiful area, very near Rancho Santa Fe, and this market is small, but carry’s items you won’t find at Vons!  Their deli has a huge variety of cooked foods if you want homemade taste without the hassle, and the Boars Head meat counter is mouth watering! So glad I stopped, and
I’ll definitely be back!</Review>

<review>They never answer the phone when you ask for the Deli--or the meat market.

They really need a manager.
They are afraid to hire a female manager.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< UserId.>

Great Market, love the deli! Their french rolls at the deli are delicious. Pricey meats but you get what you pay for. Best filets I've ever seen in a market.</text>

This is a market, not a SUPERmarket. If you need towels and laundry detergent, go elsewhere. Great selection of liquor and wine. Fresh produce and excellent guacamole. Staff is friendly.< /Text>

<Review>We needed a guaranteed COVID nucleic acid amplification test for Kauai within 72 hours of takeoff. Very efficient testing site. Staff was very nice and kept people moving through. We tested on a Saturday at 10:15am, and had results by 10:15pm. This gave us plenty of time to upload results. Also gave me peace of mind, since many places can not guarantee results in 72 hours. They have you do the swab yourself, not very far into your nose. We drove an hour to Oakland, but it was worth it.< /Review>< user_name>

Due to a weird travel plan, I needed a quick option for a rapid covid test. CityHealth was an affordable and convenient option. I ended up not needing the test, but CityHealth made it easy for me to cancel my appointment without hassle. Thanks for making life easy for anyone trying to travel.<//text>

My experience with City Health was superb! In fact it’s the easiest portion of the whole trip process. The staff at Oakland Airport (Devi) was so informative and went over and beyond by rescheduling my parties appointments with 72hrs at a location closer to our home. Also, the staff At Dublin were amazing as well. They were all very pleasant and informative and efficient! Thank you City Health</review>

<Text>The technicians were very professional, polite, courteous and friendly.  They engaged us in conversation regarding our travel plans that answered their required questions, and at the same time made it enjoyable.  They provided clear and understandable instructions that guided us in taking the "nasal swab culture.  My daughters (who were in a panic state prior to the test) applauded the entire procedure!

Thank You!< /Text>< pictures>

It was easy to find because of their tents, but didn’t there were no signs until just around the corner—Google maps takes you one way and then corrects itself once you start using you head back toward the road where you see the tents.

Once you’re there, it went smoothly. Even with short lines, it took time but it’s okay since I did have the time. You sit in your car the whole way through while staff come to your window to service you.

The staff were dry, thorough and gave clear instructions on how the test would be administered, and how the results would be received and what I would have to do with it when I receive it.

Thank you for a great experience.</Text>< Rating>

<review>Needed Covid tests for Hawaii travel.

Testing procedure was fast and relatively convenient for me. I live about 30 min from the airport so wasn’t too bad to make an extra trip to be sure to get the correct test for our Hawaii trip. Could see it being a problem if I lived farther. The people at the site were friendly and the whole procedure was through quite quickly.</text>

Everyone was very professional and very friendly . I am very happy that I found this organization. They actually listen to you and respond to every question you have. I really enjoyed how they made me feel very relaxed. Its such a relief to find an organization that actually treats you as a person and not as a number or dollar sigh. Two Thumbs Up for CityHealth.!< /Review>

<text>Fast, friendly, and had results in under 24 hours!  Website was easy to negotiate and the needed information (type of test, trusted travel partner, etc. ) clearly indicated. I’m giving them a solid A. I went to the SF downtown location (Jessie St. ). Parking nearby or take your chances on the street. You can’t turn onto Jessie because the test site is actually in the street.</text>< gmapID>

The signage for waiting could be improved since patients were approaching the site from different directions.  It would also have helped to have a dedicated "starter" but at least when I was there all of the patients were, well, patient and considerate.  The whole process only took about 15 minutes.<//text>

< Review>
Was very easy to make the appointment for the Covid test prior to my trip to Hawaii. Booked the appointment 3 days in advance to make sure there was enough time to get the results and once we got to the appointment it went very fast. No long lines and for they were very thorough with checking IDs and validating that all information was correct. Found out it was a self swabbed test which was a first for me since I was used to getting it done from the medical assistants. So it turned out to be a fun experience for all of us in the car since we had 3 adults and 2 kids to swab.. lol
Got out results in by the end of the day! Impressed and I will definitely use this service again for my next trip!< /Review>

<text>I initially had issues with booking an appointment as the website was experiencing issues and it was very difficult to get a hold of someone. I called several times a day for about 4 days until I was able to speak to someone about some questions I had. I was finally able to book an appointment at the El Cerrito location for a Covid test for Hawaii travel. Once I was there the process was very quick, staff was friendly and I received results 15 hours after testing!</text>< Rate>

<Review>I was completely stressed out about getting the test back in time. Stressed out because what if my husband got stuck at work and couldn't make his scheduled appointment. In the end everything worked out perfect. My husband did get stuck at work and through the Chat online they were able to change his appointment that morning for him. We all got our results back in only a few hours and uploading everything for our trip to Hawaii was easy.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Competent, safe, nice people working there. The only gripe: Hawaiian Airlines knew me as- full name including middle name- whereas the uploaded covid report from CityHealth named me as-first name, last name only. This caused  Hawaiian Secure Travels to disapprove my upload. Calls to Hawaiian were horrid. I waited multiple hours at a time before hanging up. Apparently the name mismatch is a glitch in their system. Still it might be best, for your clients, to include "What name will be on your flight ticket's?"  on the list of questions asked at the covid testing site. Thank you for letting me vent!<//Review><Date>1622910218384< /Date>< user_id>

Super easy and polite.  Scheduling kind of sucks but I got an appointment because they released a bunch of time slots the day before.   Their posting of time slots leaves something to be desired but once you book, it’s easy!</Text>

< Review>
Got my Covid test for Hawaii travel at their San Jose airport testing location, and received results within 12 hours. With insurance card,  I only paid $20.
I was able to book appointment ahead  of time, and was able to reschedule as well.  Their contact information on their Facebook page with email and direct phone number.  I arrived the testing site around 11am, right before long lines during lunch time.< /Review>

<user>112347106091858224724</user><text>We spent hours looking for somewhere to get covid tests to meet travel requirements for the UK. Not only was there no support from our airline or Kaiser, but there was confusing and non-specific information from the British government about which tests and at what sensitivity.

Google searches turned up places that quoted $200, $300 and even $400 - per one-hour PCR test - which for the four of US, with three lots of UK testing once we arrived was approaching the cost of the flights themselves. A CVS appointment, for which I took the morning off work and drove for half an hour each way with two small children, turned me away because I’d booked “the wrong kind of appointment” with completely unsympathetic staff.

Luckily a friend mentioned City Health, who had next-day appointments for travel-approved test at no cost, and right in the city rather than down at SFO. Staff were extremely efficient, had lots of safety precautions and were very helpful. The only thing that would’ve made it better would be if they were findable on Google!

Test before noon and you get the results by 2pm next day. Superb service for the city, thank you.</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Response>

We’re a family of four traveling to Hawaii in a couple days. We had our appointments yesterday.  Everything was so fast and easy and we got 3 out of 4 results in less than an hour. We are still waiting for one family member’s results.<//Text>

We spent hours looking for somewhere to get covid tests to meet travel requirements for the UK. Not only was there no support from our airline or Kaiser, but there was confusing and non-specific information from the British government about which tests and at what sensitivity.

Google searches turned up places that quoted $200, $300 and even $400 - per one-hour PCR test - which for the four of US, with three lots of UK testing once we arrived was approaching the cost of the flights themselves. A CVS appointment, for which I took the morning off work and drove for half an hour each way with two small children, turned me away because I’d booked “the wrong kind of appointment” with completely unsympathetic staff.

Luckily a friend mentioned City Health, who had next-day appointments for travel-approved test at no cost, and right in the city rather than down at SFO. Staff were extremely efficient, had lots of safety precautions and were very helpful. The only thing that would’ve made it better would be if they were findable on Google!

Test before noon and you get the results by 2pm next day. Superb service for the city, thank you.<//Text>

It was CityHealth San Jose, not Oakland. The wait was a little long because I guess many people are going to Hawaii. Everyone was very friendly and efficient. We will definite go back should we need the service again.</review>

I was worried about the invasive test and the timing, but to my surprise, everything was perfectly organized, the employees were super kind, and the test was done in the most comfortable way. I got the results after 18 hours.
Sincerely a big thank you to all the team.< /text>

Quick, clear, and easy! Got my results the same day, within hours. Simple drive thru, self-administered nose swab. Very nice and helpful staff. Results were texted to me by a 209 number saying San Bruno Kinetics with a link to gorillahealth which I thought was spam so I  deleted it, but luckily they sent an email too. So look out for that—it isn’t spam!</Text>

I was surprised and grateful that the testing was drive-thru. And the nurse that handled my 4 year olds testing was amazing and getting her to feel she’s in charge and that swabbing her nose was no big deal. And my results were in by 7 am the next morning— test was at 2 pm. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Great experience you self swab yourself as a staff looks and counts you down . 4 stars because they say that even though you upload your ID and insurance card does not across information and they have to upload information again.<//review>

<review>The only problem I have is that they say the testing is free but then there is a $20 "service" fee. So it's not free and for a service fee $20 is excessive.< /review><username>Barry Trute</username></record></dataset><record>

Liz Morgan, the PA that saw me, and the entire registration staff made my experience so smooth. I was a nervous wreck and they helped me and were very understanding and patient. I highly highly recommend this site if you need a COVID test. The whole process was quick, efficient, they are a well oiled machine!!! Thank you for everything!<//review>

<Text>Complaint!!!My disappointment is I was not able to pick up my prescription at Walgreen's. This was because whoever sent prescription did not pay attention to detail. Sharon said my prescription would be ready in 30 minutes. Walgreen's had my birth date wrong. My birthday is in October not February. I presented my identification two times at your office. I was quite disappointed because I really needed to start medication to treat what I came to Urgent Care for. Kind of takes away from the concept if I can't get what I need. I am still in pain and discomfort. I was not able to sleep at all last night. My face is still swollen and skin was inflamed. I called around 3:30 to explain my birth date was incorrect. I requested  for someone to call Walgreen's. Around 5:30, a man called to confirm my birth date. He did not like me asking why did this happen? He seemed not to care very much about my concerns. He told me Walgreen's will send me a text. Did not hear from Walgreen's. Called the pharmacy at 8:30 and they did not have my subscription ready. It is 6:30 in the morning now. I request the prescription to be sent this morning to Walgreen's first thing this morning. I need to start treatment immediately. Don't know if anyone will read this that cares, so I will call as soon as office is open to request this verbally. This was my first visit to Urgent Care and this experience was so horrible I will not use your services again. Whomever submitted incorrect information to Walgreen's needs to be reprimanded. I also would appreciate an apology as well. The man who called me at 5:30 had the opportunity, but instead was making excuses after I inquired "how did this happen". I will also be submitting a complaint to your corporate office. Someone needs to be held accountable. This is ridiculous. Now I have a headache.<//Text>< date>

I was able to book an appointment quickly and easily. Once I arrived, I probably had to wait a bit because there were a few cars in front of me. The staff was kind and polite and made the whole process really easy and painless.< /Review>

If you are flying to Hawaii and need the required covid test go here. Its fast and they are super efficient.  We were done in less than 30 min. Plus we made a same day appointment.  This was after waiting 2 1/2 hours in line at another "Hawaii partner", within appointment.  Only to find,  when it was our turn, out the test would take 5 days! Save yourself a lot of time and stress and use City Health, pay the fee and get results fast . We got results in 6 hours!!</Review>

I Love City Health Urgent Care of San Leandro. They are always so nice, quick, thorough, and professional. Anytime I come in I am in and out in record time. They are very good about following all covid protocol and are quick to answer any questions I may have. I recommend CHUCSL to anyone in need of quick top of the line medical care.<//Text>

We’ve been tested here (various family members) several times. We’ve all had a good experience, they make something really scary feel like routine, which is actually calming. They have all been very kind and very upfront.<//Review>

I was nervous our test results would not arrive back in time/72 hours prior to our Hawaii flights. They exceeded our expectations and our results came back in under 48 hours. There is also an option for an expedited test in under 12 hours for a small fee.  Results come back in PDF form -very efficient all around! Five stars!< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>I don’t know if this is normal, but I waited an hour and a half to get tested! I had an 11am appointment and didn’t get my test until after 12:30pm

Every step was arduously, excruciatingly, slow. Even though I had an appointment, just the act of checking me in (the first time) took 15 minutes. Then checking me in the second time (at “step 2”) took another five minutes or so. And it wasn’t just me! You can see them standing outside other cars on their tablets for an absurd amount of time.

It literally took me 45 minutes of waiting in line to get into the facility, and another 45 minutes once I was in.< /Text>< Pics>

2nd experience with CityHealth and I swear I get better diagnoses and service here than I did at Kaiser or any previous provider I’ve had. It’s a shame they only specialize in urgent care since I’ve been bouncing around for a PCP. Great Job ladies and gents, you’re on top of my list of UC providers.< /Text>

The staff were very nice, patient and had wonderful bedside manners. The assistant held my hand while I had an injection 💉! Also was required to get a Covid test before seeing doctors which was fine with me, at least I know I was negative!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Excellent service. If your employer allows you to go to this location or you can schedule and appointment, I 100% recommend. Great staff and has been improving every time I come back for repeat testing as an essential worker. Paid Parking right next door as well.</Review>

Actual Covid drive through test appointment was smooth and easy. The test results also came back the same day which was great. 4 stars instead of 5 because when my original appointment was canceled due to high winds, Cityhealth did not send me any notification letting me know it was canceled. I had to waste my time driving to the site only to find out about cancelation after I got there. This was particularly frustrating because they sent me a text reminder that morning confirming the appointment.< /Review>

<review>So, when I first booked our covid tests for pre travel to Hawaii, it said the test was a 15 min rapid test. I checked a day before our flight to California/getting tested and it is no longer that way. Instead for a fee, you can get results “within 24 hours”. Naturally, I was freaking out. But, City Health Urgent Care truly delivered! We got tested at 1:30 pm and had results back by 8:00 pm. Their customer services reps using the Facebook messenger were also great! Something important to know is that the lab picks up the samples at 2:30 pm. So, if you’re in the same boat as we were try to go before that time if you’re appointment is after that cut off. Overall, great experience!</review>< Resp>

<Review>I called urgent care and told me I can come in for a rapid covid test. I was exposed at work, working for Cal Fire. Little did they not tell me that I had to be a worker for Oakland just to get tested, something about a contract. Long story short I had to wait in line for almost 2 hours, just for them to say no.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Thank you Shirlie G. and the entire staff over at CityHealth Oakland Airport. I was one of the many Hawaii travelers that was having mini daily panic attacks about Hawaii's strict quarantine policies regarding results. I was about to cancel my trip but noticed on the CityHealth facebook page, Shirlie was guiding many people through comments and messaging. I messaged her and she informed me they are sending full PCR results rapidly to the lab for a $120 fee. I spoke with a few people who did this and all got their results super fast. The testing experience this morning was super smooth. Really want to extend gratitude to all of the staff- from the security guard guiding cars, to the many helpers in line simply taking IDs and getting us all checked in quickly. The entire process was painless and quick. Make sure you tell the provider who is doing your swab that you want the PCR test for the 24 hr result and pay the $120 fee, yes they accept card. I was waiting for my results like a psychopath, refreshing my email every hour. I got tested at 11am this morning.. I got my results in by 8:30pm ! Amazing. Thank you Shirlie, and ALL of the hard-working CityHealth employees for dedicating your time to get people tested. I truly appreciate your professionalism and great service !! Highly recommend CityHealth and don't worry travelers, if you have your appointment set 72 hrs in advance, pay the $120 fee you WILL have your results in time ! I would just recommend booking a morning appointment if possible.<//Text>

<text>It was very cold outside it took over 30 minutes to be tested.  Once tested the worker said that the results would come back in 30 minutes. After waiting 45 minutes I ask would they check foe status of results. They said the meter was on 3 minutes. I asked could they give me my results via email and she said yes.  I wish I was told that option in the beginning.<//text>< username>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!! THEY ARE IRRESPONSIBLE AND RECKLESS!!! My whole family was suppose to fly to Maui today, November 17, 2020, so we did our Covid test on Sunday, November 15, 2020 so our result would come in within 72 hrs before our flight, which is Hawaii's travel regulation to have Covid test result from within 72 hours before flight. I called the Lab, which is Curative, but they have not even received our specimen yet today which is already the day of our flight. I tried to call City Health Urgent Care, but no one is answering in any of their phones listed on any branch around the area. So we have to cancel our flights, our hotel and our vacation is all ruined because rebooking last minute is very expensive already. Who knows how many persons or families they have ruined their vacations, plans and travels because they are irresponsible and reckless. They just wasted our money, time and insurance. I think they are just a scam that is just after the insurance money and will try to scam more money out of your pocket.</Text>

<Text>New to area so this was a great place to go for treatment. Online appointments make your life easy. Simple check in process, very clean and nicely appointed facility. Kudos to Matthew who did my initial assessments. Very thorough exam and discussion with Sean regarding treatment and next steps. It’s a one stop shop with doctors and all lab work in one place. Very convenient with parking in the building on Clay St with validated parking coming soon. Highly recommend.</Text><username>gabrielle morris< /username></record>

<text>Update December 7, 2020:
——————————————-

Shirlie went above and beyond to help us get our Covid rest results 3 days after we arrived in Honolulu. Warrior DX lab did not deliver on their promise and CityHealth Urgent Carr did their best to address the problem. CityHealth Urgent Care reimbursed me for the lost costs of my travel with a check that they mailed to my address! I truly appreciate this level of follow up and customer care! I don’t update my review to 5 star because CityHealth Urgent care decided to work with an incompetent lab! However, it seems like they are not working with them anymore and they secured partnership with other labs. Hopefully, things will be better in the future!

Original Review:
—————————

DO NOT USE THIS PLACE FOR PRE-TRAVEL COVID TEST FOR HAWAII!! We are stuck at a hotel instead of our Airbnb and anxiously waiting for the results while losing a lot of money on both Airbnb and hotel. We are paying for a hotel where we must quarantine and the airbnb which we cannot use while waiting for the results! Our test was done on November 3 and we still have not received the results which were guaranteed to be sent within 72 hours! This issue caused serious financial and emotional problems for us. There is no one answering phone calls, emails or texts. We tried many many times to contact them and no one answers!

Save yourself from a nightmare and go somewhere else for your covid test!</text>< Pictures>

Arrived for a pre-travel COVID test within the specified hours. Was politely asked to go to a San Francisco branch instead, 11 miles and 30 minutes drive away. Why? I’m still not sure, as internet details for this site state ‘no referral required’ and ‘testing for all patients’. I’m an MD, and I’m pretty sure that I meet these criteria. Important to have up to date information on the internet to prevent wasting people’s time :). Thanks for your help.< /text>

Worst medical facility I’ve ever been to, they took my money, let me sit for an hour although they didn’t even have a doctor who could prescribe a medication - don’t go there!!  It’s a sham operation!!  Shouldn’t they have a doctor if they are going to make appointments for medical care???</Review>

<Text>First time in this brand new facility. Great overall experience! Made an apt online, which is always great. Arrived to an empty waiting room on a Friday around noon, was handed a touch screen for my info and taken to the back within 10 minutes. Intake guy was chill and thorough, and PA I saw (Sean) was prompt, professional and caring. Pretty much the whole process is paper-free, and the Walgreens just a block away makes picking up prescriptions super easy. Will definitely visit again (but hopefully not too soon!)<//Text>< pictures>

<review>This was my first visit to an urgent care clinic, and it was great. The place was clean and organized. All the staff were wonderful, from the front desk to the technicians and the doctor, too; all were caring and helpful.  Making the appointment online and online check in were really easy, too. I’ll certainly come back when the need arises.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f8143c3fddd05:0x856c0d9511588fb0</Gmap_id><user_name>Amy May</user_name><Time>1568416167260<//Time></record>

I had a little difficulty finding the clinic.  Although the address is on Clay Street, the actual entrance is on 14th.  It is downtown ( across from both City Hall and federal buildings), but I easily found parking. Probably a better idea to take Bart or public transit. The staff were pleasant and helpful, but for some reason their credit card reader was sending out the wrong IRS code, so I couldn't use my medical flex spending account for my copay charge. Fortunately, it did take my debit card.
I was there to meet with the Doctor as she was referred by my current physician who is retiring. Dr Salmon was very personable & professional. Took my vitals, listened to my concerns & offered relevant and helpful suggestions. I would really like to continue to see her, although the location of the clinic is really inconvenient for me.  If you live nearby,
have access to public transit ,or don't
mind dealing with downtown Oakland traffic, I do recommend this clinic<//Text>

Facility and personnel provided excellent service. It was easy to make an appointment as well as find the location. Staff took all the time I needed to complete my evaluation and feel like we covered all details. Would recommend to anybody needing to see a medical professional.</text>

CityHealth Urgent care was great! All of the staff were super friendly and welcoming and answered all my questions! Dr. Sean was extremely attentive and listened to my concerns. Plus I did not have insurance and the price was reasonable for paying out of pocket! I highly recommend!< /text>

<text>This place is completely sketchy. I scheduled an appt here for covid testing with a person over the phone, received a text reminder, arrived and had to wait 15 minutes before I was told they were closed that day. A whole family arrived and had the same thing happen to them. And apparently this has been happening for months! Seems incompetently run, for-profit healthcare. It's not the staff's fault this is why companies shouldn't be in charge of managing our health.

It's either gross mismanagement or somethings going on like they get state funding based on how many appts they schedule and they're abusing it. Places like this shouldn't exist much less be trusted with personal information.</text>< pictures>

Came in for a visit and got seen relatively quickly. Service was good but I specifically asked to send the billing to my insurance so I can pay with my HSA card but they instead charged me $125 (with the receipt saying services.. an itemized receipt would be nice) on the card I paid my $20 Co pay with. I was planning to pay with my HSA like I told them but now I can't because I won't have it in the new year. If you go here, pay your co-pay with cash and don't let them hold your card on file.<//Review>

From beginning to end, I was a bit unsatisfied with my care. The Asian receptionist was giving me a hard time because I didn’t have a tangible copy of my insurance card. The PA didn’t realize that the medication prescribed was conflicting with current medications until I mentioned it. I could’ve had a serious reaction to the medication prescribed if I didn’t say anything. Lastly, I was waiting on my Uber and the receptionist kept trying to kick me out although it was 15 minutes remaining until closing time. She passively aggressively asked me to leave several times although it wasn’t closing time. I felt so uncomfortable that I left despite it being cold outside. I’m never returning and wouldn’t  recommend anyone that cares about their medical care to return.<//text>

Sean the physician assistant is not only clinically very keen, but his bed side manner and sympathetic ear makes going to urgent care an easier experience.  He takes his time and listens to you, actually listens.  For me, you can not put enough stars on here for that quality.  I recommend this urgent care and Sean when you are sick or injured and need to get in to a medical provider.  The staff there are also nice and very polite, which again is a rare thing in this day and age, I wish I could use this as my primary care.<//Review>< UserId.>

<text>Just went to CityHealth with a troublesome earache. I did not have an appointment but I was seen very quickly. The PA was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and quickly diagnosed the problem. Saved me from hours waiting in the ER, and days of waiting to be seen by my primary doctor. Wonderful and convenient service in beautiful new offices. Happy to recommend and will definitely be back!<//text>< pictures>

Unfortunately my 3 year old daughter smashed her thumb and needed stitches. The staff here was amazing, compassionate and caring. The clinician Sean Parkin was friendly and really took great care for my daughter. I recommend this place to everyone who is looking for superb care. Thanks again Sean, Sofya and Matthew who X-rayed my daughters thumb! 5 star service!!<//text>

Whenever I call the Oakland office it doesn't matter what time no one ever answers. There's not even an option to talk to someone in the Oakland office. how am I supposed to set an appointment if no one's going to answer the damn phone?</Text>

I had no appointment and they got me in in about the amount of time it took to fill out the registration forms.  Examination/xrays/evaluation happened back to back for what turned out to be a sprained/bruised foot and ankle.  They gave me a boot and I was out in an hour and a half total.<//review>

Had our covid tests done at Sac airport. Orderly and efficient service. Staff very friendly, especially the testers. Results done in 18 hours. No stress, felt comfortable, pleasant experience from setting appointment to messaging support to actual test process.</review>

Heidi was awesome. My results were moving a little slow and every time I called she was very kind and very helpful. She even made sure that everYthing was taken care of at the end of the day. It’s nice to know that there are still people like her out there.Thank you!

They were fast, quick and efficient! I made separate appts for my family but they were able to do it all at one time! Did our test right before noon and got the results back around 10pm! I was able to upload out results and didn’t have to worry about when the test results were coming!<//Text>

CityHealth is an affordable & convenient option for COVID testing for travel to Hawaii. This was our 2nd time using them. Easy to get timely appts, friendly staff, there was a short wait in line (our appt was on a Monday around noon’ish) but once they verified ur appt/name/ID, it moved pretty fast.
Thank you for ur service, CityHealth!<//review>
