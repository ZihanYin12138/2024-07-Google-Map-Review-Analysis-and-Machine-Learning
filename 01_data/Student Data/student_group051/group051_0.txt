I am always able to get the parts I need to complete a job from these people. Case in point. Today I needed a new motor for my forced air heating system. I checked 2 other places which couldn't get anything until Tuesday. I called Coast and not only were they open but they had a right part in stock. I was able to get it and install it and my wife is happy again to have heat for tonight. Thank you Coast.<//Text>

<Review>Boss Lady sent me away to Johnstone supply after looking at a standard wall heater gas valve I brought in for replacement. For some reason they didn't feel like being helpful in person and I wasted my whole day looking for a part they had in stock all along when I called back later.

Beautiful place for a small company to look at the bay and have a sandwich. For YC members "only" though. Not touristic at all.<//text>

<text>An unbelievable experience that you can only find here,... right here ,..... nowhere else in the world can you find this experience. Absolutely worth the effort and money to get yourself here to paddle out in the Pacific Ocean at pillar point harbor.  Ask about the full moon paddle to really BLOW your mind.<//text>< UserId.>

Very good access to Dog Beach. Best place to walk your dog on the beach near half Moon Bay because the water is protected by the break water system. If your dog loves water this is the place.< /Review>

I was fortunate to have been invited by Travis R. Conte, Berkshire Hataway, Residential and Commercial Realtor. An ouside BBQ was the method used to prepare the food. The weather at the Club was perfect. Not too old or hot. It was such a pleasure to be there and leave with lasting memories!!<//review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Perfect for sunny days. The waves are quiet and soothing. Sea lions and seals are also swimming spots :) Parking is limited.

晴れた日に最適。波が静かで癒されます。アシカ、アザラシも泳いでくるところです :) 駐車場は数に限りがあります。< /Text>

Dena Burger is awesome and is now a new favorite of mine! Their burger selection is sure to satisfy even the picky eaters. The combination plates and traditional Mexican plates are all very enticing. I recommend this place to all of my friends in the area.< /Review>

Maybe I came on an ‘off’ day for this place.

During my time here 5 orders were fulfilled including mine. My order was wrong....asked for no cheese on the burger - simple request, but I guess too much to ask for.

Plus, the staff cussed in Spanish...I’m like ummm???

And just after I left, some guys showed up with some beers and sat in the patio....guess that’s allowed.

I will not be coming back here.</Review>

<review>Never going there again. I got a chili cheese hot dog. It was disgusting. I couldn't tell where the meat was or the bun, it was smothered in chili and cheese. The chili was boiling hot but the actual hot dog was cold. The hot dog tasted low quality; like it was microwaved and the chili had no flavor. The cherry on top is that my soda was more like just a cup of ice. Bye bye.<//review>< pictures>

We’ve found this place to be great for quick food runs at all hours. Often get their chili cheese fries or burritos. Their street tacos are pretty great, and my parents ordered their breakfast sandwich recently and said it was the best they’d ever eaten.<//text>

The worst service. Waited 20 minutes but was the only person in the drive through. She got my order wrong. I spent $10 for a sandwhich and a coke in a can. Would’ve been “fine” if she would’ve heard me right and added fries with my orders. I went through the drive through so I wouldn’t have to wait so much but they had me come out of the car anyways...  never coming to eat there again.</review>

Ordered their Cobb salad. It was very nice and the price was much cheaper than surrounding establishments.  Also loved that their service was with a smile. Only small complaint was that it was a little warm in the place.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Very friendly employees and a man who I think is the owner kindly attended me, I ordered a hamburger and the service was fast, highly recommended although the place looks like its impeccable cleanliness is old. Thank you.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The person who was in charge is very rude someone else asked him if he waited for 1 hour while his son was going to measure his shoes and the woman he attended told him he could wait half an hour and he should not have told him that but he told him very bad way

(Original)
La persona que estaba a cargo es muy ruda otra persona le pidió que si le esperaba 1 hora mientras iba x su hijo para medirle los zapatos y la mujer k atendia le dijo que podia esperar media hora y k ni eso deberia de haver pero se lo dijo de muy mala manera</Review>

<Review>I ❤️ The Dollar Tree.... Nothing but a Dollar 😄. Nice People, Polite,  Just Nice Workers there. I ❤️get the Batteries small & Big & Other Nice Holiday Things They Have There. Yesterday I Just bought 2# Apple 🍎 Cinnamon Automatic Spray Refills. Smells So Nice. Every time I go by there Also Something New. They  have Things in the Refrigerator eggs turkey 🦃 bacon , cheese, ,butter, even Ice cream, french fries 🍟😋. Try the Texas Garlic cheese bread. So good. I ❤️ they're Wheat bread. Cat Food, dog food toys. " Thank You Everyone" for Your Nice Service. God Bless you All😇".... For Someone Who Asked About Curbside Pick up?  I Called & Sorry they Don't.</Review><rating>5</rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

I got my hair done about a week ago and it was washed and styled so it took a few days for my to notice the damage but my hair is a mess. Chopped off in the wrong places, I got layers when I specifically said I did not want them. It’s uneven on the sides. Marbella took close to 6 inches off toward the front. It’s going to take years to get back what I had. I’m so disgusted with the work. I take really good care of my hair and it was down to my waist, now some of it is barely past my shoulders. Should report her to the board.<//text>

<Review>We love it here for both children! The entire staff is friendly, focused, and organized. The dental team is thorough and highly-skilled. We are always so impressed with their kid-friendly acumen; the children are treated with respect and spoken to as equals. The dental team does an excellent job walking through the steps of their procedures so the child feels comfortable and knows what to expect along the way. Their website is also full of valuable information - check it out! This Dentistry came highly recommended to us by our pediatrician, and we are so thankful.<//Review>< Pics>

My kids have always had the best experience here, with movies playing, prizes for good visits and kind and thoughtful staff. Even when my kids have had difficult procedures performed, like tooth extractions, they have still had a positive experience without any fear. We absolutely love this office and can not recommend them enough.</review>< GmapID>

<review>The team at Santa Monica Dentistry for Children is great. Professional, organized, and always on time which is very important when you’ve got three little ones. The staff is patient and takes their time. I love the combination of orthodontics as well. A good fit for our family. Definitely recommend.< /review>< pictures>

It's always a pleasure to visit your office.  The staff is very friendly and the office is very clean.  My 4-year-old is always excited for his 6-month check up.  I would give 10 stars if I could.<//text>

Santa Monica Dentistry for Children is a wonderful dentist office. The staff is all so kind and friendly. The dentists are very patient and take the time to explain treatment and information to parents and children while treating children kindly and including them in care and treatments. Highly recommend!< /Text>

First time bringing in a 3-year old - they were fantastic in making her feel comfortable and helping me as a parent to take better care of her teeth. I wish all medical appointments could be like this one.<//Review>

Fantastic office!  I myself am an orthodontist and bring my two children to see the doctors at Santa Monica Dentistry for Children.  They are very thorough in their diagnosis and provide excellent treatment for their patients.  Everyone in the office is extremely warm and caring.  5 stars all around!</review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>After a big move during the pandemic times from one side of the country to another, I needed to find a good place for my kids to check their teeth. I found Santa Monica Dentistry on Google and I couldn’t be happier! From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed and helped in seconds! All the staff is super friendly and professional! We were helped by Dr. Kim, she is absolutely professional, kind and the way she connected with my kids was wonderful! Thank you so much for making us feel welcomed in your practice! We can’t wait to see you again in 6 months!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Santa Monica Dentistry for children has been taking care of our son since he was 3 years old. He is now 9 years old. The customer service is second to no other, all of the staff treats customers with the respect and so friendly. The dentist and dental assistants really take pride in making sure their little patients are comfortable with every procedure.  Great place to take your kids!!< /text>

This was my son's first visit to the dentist and it couldn't have been a more pleasant experience.  From the front desk to Patty to Dr. Stone, everyone was professional and kind.  Bennett says, "it was GREAT!".  Thank you all, see you in 6 months!</text>

<review>My children's experience at Santa Monica Dentistry for children is always exceptional.  Even while getting a cavity fixed, my 9 y.o. daughter was completely at ease due to the kind and gentle explanations from Dr. Jessie Schwartz, and the wonderful staff who are with her every step of the way.  I can't say enough good things about Santa Monica Dentistry for children, and both of my children have been going here for 8 years!<//review>< pics>

My children ask to go to the dentist!
The doctors are all so sweet, gentle and thorough.
The staff are always so professional and so kind and engaging with the kids.  We've moved to SFV 5 years ago and we still fight traffic to go there.  Highly recommended.</review>

I have been to this place twice for my three-year-old daughter’s dental checkup. She enjoys as her teeth being cleaned and examined by the nurse and the doctor. I experienced a great care.

The environment is kid-friendly. There are supplies for children to scribble or color on the appropriate places provided in the waiting area. This place has TV to keep the kids calm while at the critical checkups. After every checkup, each child is allowed to take one toy out of plenty of little toys. Overall, I highly recommend this dentistry.<//text>

<review>We've been through a few pediatric dentists over the years, and Dr. Schwarz and her team have been the best--hands down. You need to have super powers to talk an anxious kid into the dental chair and keep them there when the going gets tough. This dentist is the real deal. And the staff are simply wonderful. My only complaint is that I wish they serviced adults.</review>< pictures>

Not that they necessarily need yet another five-star review, but they deserve it. Fantastic dentists. Dr. Swarz a is just lovely - professional, kind, and so accommodating. She and the staff treat kids and parents alike warmly and explain things in a way that's easily understood. I don't write many reviews but this was one I couldn't resist posting.<//Text>

The care and knowledge/expertise of Dr. Stone and her highly trained staff is unparalleled. I wish she had time to include adult patients, but I’m so glad she pours her time and love into these littles. We’ve been with this office since my son started sprouting teeth. He’s six and a half now and every time we go, my son is so happy. He has a very complicated mouth situation, so his joy is truly attributed to the wonderful way Dr. Stone has demanded excellence of herself and her staff. They have thought of everything to ensure each child’s visit is the best possible experience. I am so thankful to encourage and recommend other parents get to this office straight away for any children’s dental needs. You’ll be relieved you found her!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>Dr. Stone and her staff make taking your children to the dentist a fun and educational experience.  They are gentle, kind and so sweet, not to mention extremely proficient.  I would highly recommend Santa Monica Dentistry for Children to anyone looking for a pediatric dentist.  They are the absolute best!<//review>< pics>

I never thought I'd be rating a dentist.  But we took our 5 year old son here and the experience was incredible.  Dr. Stone understands children and the service is spot on awesome.  Highly recommended.<//text>

<Text>I brought my 2.5 year old son to Dr. Stone for the first time today. Both Dr. Stone and the hygienist Annelle were so patient and wonderful in explaining everything calmly to my son as they went through the cleaning, and Dr. Stone took as much time with me as I needed to ask questions. I had a question about my baby daughter's teeth too (even though it wasn't her appointment) and Dr. Stone happily talked with me about that as well. I'm so happy we found them!</Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<review>We have been coming to this office since my now 4 year old was about a year old. They are so kid friendly and give the perfect amount of enthusiasm to really keep her entertained and happy throughout the appointment. They always have a fun movie playing, cute sunglasses to help with the light and they have about 20 different flavors of toothpaste. If you have a child and they aren't coming here, you're missing out!!!< /review>< user>

Very kid friendly environment. I appreciate how positive and understanding the dentist is. My son's teeth had a lot of plaque and rather than make me feel guilty about it, she was sympathetic and helped me see how I could improve in the future.

My son likes going to the dentist because he gets to watch a movie and pick a prize, and I like it because his teeth are now clean and healthy again.< /Review>

<response>None<//response><Review>I love taking my daughter to Santa Monica Dentistry for Children. Both Dr. Stone and Dr. Schwartz are Moms and you can really tell.  The first time my daughter went to the dentist, Dr. Stone sat with her for about 20 patiently getting her to open her mouth. Dr. Stone explained everything and joked with my daughter, who finally let her "count" her teeth. Since then my daughter has gone to the dentist with pleasure. She loves getting new toothbrushes and the special prizes. I only wish that my dentist was as gentle and kind as Dr. Stone.<//Review></record>

EXCELLENT! My 2 year old daughter fell and cut her gums and lip on a friday at 5:00pm. They not only took me but spent extra time making sure my daughter was calm, happy and walked away with a huge smile. I cannot  recommend this dental practice more! Dr. Ellen Stone is a STAR!</text>

They have always worked well with my child, who can sometimes be reluctant. Always walks away with a smile, and gets more courageous each time -- with this energetic, encouraging staff!<//review>

<username>Kristy Ibarra Wells</username><Text>I ABSOLUTELY love bringing my son to see Dr. Schwarz and her staff.  Today was just not a good experience, and I'm sure it was just one of those days, and the luck of the draw.  I checked my son in early since we needed to use the restroom.  I informed the front desk staff that we are in no rush.  My son was called and he was apprehensive to get started.  The staff member said 'i'll be right back' and my partner carried my son into the back and none of the staff members knew who had called in my son.  The same staff member came from around the corner and said loudly 'oh, they are 30 mins early, so i'm just going to take someone else', and walked away.  I acknowledge that were early, and had even mistaken the appointment by 15 minutes, but I felt she was very aggressive, yet dismissive in her way of handling the moment.  I really do enjoy this office and have always enjoyed my experience.  I know this will not happen again at my son's next appointment.  A little bit of kindness does go a long way.<//Text>< Time>

< Review>
This was the most upsetting experience I have ever had taking my child to the dentist. There were an enormous amount of clues I should have picked up on before I let her give him fillings, from billing to various other issues, but nothing was more upsetting than her. Number one she told me when we went in to see her that he had a large amount of cavities. I have now taken those x-rays to a separate dentist to have them evaluated and according to her she didn't see any, however initially I trusted her. She suggested that we don't do them all at once and break it up in 2 appointments. She then asked me if he was afraid of needles.. I said no more that the average child but my older one had a bit more of a phobia for needles and could still handle a shot in the mouth. She suggested that we should to nitrous/ laughing gas but I really wasn't comfortable with that. She again insisted and that it just made the whole experience less traumatic for the child. When we came back and I again expressed my concern about nitrous she again insisted that it was not a big deal, but in fact it was extremely traumatic.. not for him but for me. As I watched essentiality him being drugged while she had a tv monitor inches from his face playing some kids movie I realized that this was more for her benefit than the child's. The kids are so out of it and distracted it makes it easy for her to do her job. I was so effected by the experience I felt I almost never wanted to take him to another dentist. When I called the office to ask why she insisted that he get nitrous she apparently had noted in his chart that he was needle phobic which never came form my mouth.

I have since found an amazing desist who has done new x-rays and said that he does not need any of the remaining filings that she suggested. I would suggest to any parents to stay away from her. She is greedy, lazy and unethical, I am so relieved to find a great trust worthy dentist who doesn't feel its necessary to drug every kid that comes n for a filling..< /Review>

<review>My 2, soon to be 3 year old unfortunately has some cavities. My husband took him to his first appointment which is where we discovered all our diligent teeth brushing and flossing did not pay off.
I went today for his follow up. I didn’t think much of the office UNTIL we got called in. Fun and bright orange and very warm energy. TV screens on the ceilings! How could you not LOVE going to the dentist??
Meeting Dr. Schwarz: THE SWEETEST and SOOO genuinely warm. Made me sad I never had a dentist like her growing up and so very blessed to have her for my children. She was reassuring and gentle. My son is horrible at sitting still. But was great about letting her check his teeth. Really, to me she’s just incredible. And with the routine she gave us, were able to hold off more decay.
Lastly, my son knows there’s a toy box. I have no clue but I follow him to this... mini prize area. Bouncy balls, toy cars, dinosaurs...and soo much more!! I spoke with one of the hygienist/assistants who is in charge of the unbelievable toy box. She goes to great efforts to make that toy area sooo special. She watched my son try to load up.  He had 8 toy cars and I luckily managed to get him to put 7 back down. But it made her so happy watching him which in turn made me smile.
I’m now blown away and slightly jaded I only got floss and a mean hygienist from my dentist growing up. They genuinely love kids here. They just want to see your child smile, happy, and enjoy going to the dentist. Which is far from my own experience. This is the place to go. Honest. I don’t do reviews. Only a few and it’s because I found myself compelled to, in a good way because I was moved by kindness or had really special unique experience.<//review>< Rating>

Dr Jessie Schwarz is fantastic.  My son had so much cavities and a medical condition that all the dentists I took him to before Dr. Schwarz weren't confident to treat him.  They either referred me to other dental specialists or even to a dental surgeon.  Earlier doctors suggested that my toddler son to be put out completely with general anesthesia for them to get the work done.  As young he is and I don't believe that the earlier doctors' opinion is in the best interest for my son.  I kept searching for the best children dentists in town and I found Dr. Schwarz.  Dr. Schwarz was able to treat severe cavities for my son without general anesthesia.  She and her assistant have ways to keep my generally very anxious son calm before and during the treatments.  My son cavities were taken care of and he is not afraid to go to Dr. Schwarz's office.   I'm very happy with this doctor and her staffs.  They are highly recommended.< /Text>

Food was excellent.  Establishment was also very nice, clean and well maintained. My only complaint was that they take forever to take and get your order out. Walked in at 5:00pm got my food at 5:42.< /text>

(Translated by Google) This restaurant is disgusting, My coffee and My husband were served with dirty rates, and the waitress tells me that she washes the dishes, does not wash well, that is not an excuse, hence they are wrong with the bill, they charge In addition, fix the total, the manager is rude, yells at customers, is grocero, bad experience not recommended.

(Original)
Este restaurant es un asco, me sirvieron Mi cafe y de Mi esposo con las tasas sucias, y me dice la mesera es el que lava trastes la culpa, no lava bien, eso no es escusa, de ahi ce equivocan con el bill, cobran de mas, fijence de el total, el manager es un grosero, le grita a los clientes, es grocero, mala experiencia no lo rrecomiendo.<//text>

Very satisfied. Easy to schedule and tech showed up on time. Performed the agreed upon work and did a good job. Other quotes that I got were trying to upsell on everything and even a whole new bumper when I told them specifically this car is for my son that is turning 16 in a month and I WAS not replacing the bumper. Easy to pay on the link when work is complete. I would definitely use them again if needed in the future.<//review>

Definitely Carbody Lab is the place to go to, I trusted them with my 2018 Tesla Model 3 and they went over and beyond to make sure I was pleased I was extremely pleased with the quality as well as there customer service. Their representative Maria was excellent and so professional. Thank Carbody Lab</review>

I tried several brick and mortar body shops to repair a  dent in the back of my Toyota Tundra. They all  hovered  around $1200.00.   I received the same level of repair in my driveway   From Car Body Lab and never had to leave the house. They came to me and did a truly professional job with a professional technician and I was able to communicate with the dispatcher and the technician all the time so I never wasted any time and the job only took about 4 hours to complete.    I watched and asked questions the entire operation. The technician never got upset with me and tolerated my interrogation. Never had to leave the vehicle or or have to wait to go back to the vehicle.  it was all ready to go on the spot.. I can't see why  Anyone would use a brick and mortar.. Oh yeah and by the way it only cost $455. Which is about a 3rd of what it would cost in a brick and mortar store.<//text>

I am so happy I found car body lab. I sadly backed into something and scratched the paint on my rear side bumper. Rather than taking it to a body shop so they could hold it for a week and cost me a rental car along with triple the cost I was lucky to have car body lab come to me at my convenience and repair it at my house. They had it done in an hour and it looks perfect like nothing ever happened. I’d definitely recommend them!!<//text>

I googled a car body work shop in my area. “Car body lab” came up. From the website I was told to use my phone to take a picture of the dent in my car and text to them. About 8 minutes later they text me back a estimate for the body work and a link to make an appointment. The pricing was great. The body work done on the car look brand new. The company is very professional. The business model is in genius! I highly recommend them!</text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I was skeptical about using this service after receiving a quote that was under 25% of the body shop quote I received, but I couldn't be happier.  Andy, the technician arrived early, said it wouldn't be bad to fix, and got right to work.  He did a great job fixing and painting it in my driveway.  The results are great, I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7vsZCVaRMoicdGPFwK3nnC6S2rLICKNyfikOt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0hQnX2CJa2qV8wKIv-A1VQrOGxuYvBexSjN67=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHPZhRy1bfDE0WD-EP-jZ_FJ9CWaQL3pOYiJ8l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZWAfifGXDJ7HsoPyim8Dlj2y3PvlHABcRBEUj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c6358395394f:0xeea83e07875097c7< /Gmap_id></record>

Dented the front bumper of my Rogue. Very thorough and professional service. I work a lot and my hours make it difficult to schedule car stuff. The fact that they come to your house is amazing. Found this company and they were awesome. My part took a while to come in but they kept me updated and got me scheduled quickly when it arrived. Took only 4 hours. Car tech was polite and worked fast. Really pleased with how it turned out. Would definitely use them again and would recommend in a heartbeat.<//text>

Submitting photos for a general quote was simple and efficient. The response time from them was outstanding! I am still waiting to hear back from other companies I inquired with. Pricing is very fair and the work quality 5 stars. I have a "baby" bimmer (2 series) but was worried the paint match might not be right, however, it was absolutely spot on. My technician was professional, personable, and very clean with everything. I will certainly recommend this service for anyone I know looking to do paint touch ups. Thank you guys very much!<//Text>< Pics>

I was referred to CarBody Lab by a friend. I had dents to be fixed after a small accident. I was a little nervous at first but I made an appointment and I was very impressed after the job was done. Jose Vargas was my technician. He was very professional and knowledgeable regarding the process. He walked me through it. You would have never guessed something was wrong after the finished look. I was also nervous about how the color would match as the color of my car as it is pretty specific but I was so happy to see it was the exact stock color on the car. I will definitely be referring this company to family and friends! Thanks Guys!</text>

My KIA Soul was made new again and I was very  impressed with the professionalism of the tech who did my repairs. My KIA was less than three weeks old and got scraped up by some Neanderthal at my local HEB. Didn’t even leave a “so sorry” note!  Work was completed in my garage in a very timely manner. I  HIGHLY recommend CarBodyLab!  Two Thumbs Up!!<//review>

Car Body Lab was a very professional company and a pleasure to do business with.  From the quote to the technician doing the service was a great experience. My SUV bumper looks brand new again, I can't recommend them enough.<//Text>

< review>
Sadly this has been one of the worst experiences I have had with an auto company. I paid 230 to have my paint replaced on the front right fender of my truck. Pablo and his son did a great job, but were very careless to other areas of my truck. This car is less than 2 weeks old and had no scratches on the tailgate when purchased. They wrap the whole car in plastic and when removing they plastic they scratched the tailgate multiple times with a razor blade. I contacted Pablo the technician to let him know about the mistake and he said he would not be returning as he did not do any damage. I reached out to the corporate office and they reviewed ,y phots below and took 0  responsibility or accountability. It just does not make any sense to me because if these scratches already existed I would have asked the technician to fix these originally. This company also quoted me 395 to come back and fix these scratches which they declined service after I agreed. From the corporate office to customer service to the technician is was by far the most unprofessional service I have ever experienced. I would HIGHLY recommend you take your business elsewhere.</review>

{'time': 1614461504654, 'text': "Hi Dalton. We're sorry to hear you were not satisfied with your experience. We vetted the pictures you submitted and reviewed them with several technicians who confirmed these were not razor blade scratches. While it is common for a technician to remove plastic from a vehicle using a razor blade, he would've had to accidentally bladed your tailgate countless times from what these photos suggest.\n\nIt' also appears that you agreed to pay for your tailgate repair and have our technician come back to work on your vehicle. However, he politely declined to service you as he felt he was being falsely accused of scratching your tailgate. We hope you understand."}<//Response>

<Text>Got a quote very quickly after filling out the request form. Excellent communication where they made sure my location would work for the job. Arrived on time and made the car look brand new again! Auto work is never cheap but it was definitely worth it. And they charged less than Auto body shops would.< /Text><Response>None<//Response><rate>5<//rate>< Date>

My mom accidentally bumped into a shopping cart. Some other customer was kind enough to push their cart up against my moms car instead of using the cart return area and my mom didn’t see it.

There were just minor scratches to the bumper so we didn’t need any paint repair other than to buff out the scratches so I can’t review the quality of painting.

The bumper however, did cave in quite extensively.

Many thanks to Courtney for repairing my moms car last week. He was on time, professional, and very friendly.

They came to my moms house and had her car repaired in just a few hours. And the cost was at least a third of what I expect a body shop would have charged.

This allowed my mom to afford to pay out of pocket in lieu of filing an insurance claim. Thanks guys.</text>

<Review>I had a 2" deep scratch on my almost new bright red Tesla S passenger door.  The sheet metal is aluminum so is not so easy to remove dents, but Erik made the dent virtually disappear, and the color match is perfect.  When Eric was finished, I could not see the incident!   Excellent service and dent/painting expertise.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Although the technician was late (due to weekend traffic) the quality and the repair time easily made up for it. Not only was I stunned by the fact that a single technician did the job (which I'm amazed he was able to do since I couldn't find anything on the internet nor in my vehicle manual on how to replace the bumper) but also by how quietly he did the work! I didn't even know he'd started! In fact, I assumed he was sitting in my garage stumped as to how to switch out my damaged bumper with the new one. Before I knew it he was knocking on my door to tell me he was finished! And the end result was flawless. I think I may have even teared up because the work he'd done made my car look like new! I'm so glad and relieved I went with Car Body Lab for my vehicle body repair after so many others refused or wanted a ridiculous amount of money for the job. Keep up the good work folks!</Text><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

<review>I live San Diego and have called on Car Body Lab three times  in  the last 2  or 3 years and the service and the results have been excellent. This last time there were some small body repairs and painting needed on the right asrear quarter panel of my Outback. Scheduling was easy, my technicians were top-rate and the results look factory original at a cost at least half of what I expected to pay.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Someone rolled into the back of my one week old car on the highway and put a small crack in my rear bumper. I wish I would have left this review sooner because I have now forgotten my technicians name, but he was awesome! He knocked on my door at exactly 10:30am which was my scheduled time. He made sure to cover the rest of my car as he welded/painted so that it wasn’t touched. I came out once to offer him water and he politely stated that he came prepared. He was very professional and didn’t leave a trace of evidence behind when he left. So far, I have referred Car Body Lab to two friends needing services and I will definitely be using them again if necessary in the future (but hopefully not) :)< /Text>

I have used them before on my new lexus and this time I needed body work done on my Honda CRV. They are very professional and with very competitive pricing. I feel 100% comfortable with them and the quality of work shows. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

I had about a 8 inch scratch on my car, that really stood out. Omar made it look as if it were never there. Nicole provided excellent customer service and getting an appointment was convenient. I would certainly recommend Car Body Lab to others for any paint job.</review>

<Review>I had a scratch on my front bumper that needed to be cleared and I reached out to CarBody Lab wanting to correct the ugly looking white line. First impression is they’re very fast with scheduling an appointment and very polite. Fast forward to the day of the appointment, I left my car at the location they rented out and then proceeded to piggyback on home. 2 hrs later and my car is ready! At first I didn’t notice it but there’s some very light, light, light markings still present and I thought they would have buffed that out which they did a very good job with the rest of the bumper well. But I’m not complaining since they offer lifetime warranty so if it goes bad I have them to look back to.<//Review></record>

<Review>I reached out the Car Body Lab for a large dent above my driver-side back wheel. Every other body shop was quoting me triple what they did and they came to my house, probably the most convenient experience I've ever encountered while dealing with my car. Everyone told me the whole panel would need to be replaced, but that was completely not true. Rudy showed up on time, was so polite, explained everything they were going to do, welcomed all my questions, and ensured that if I had any questions/concerns after, he would gladly come back. I feel so grateful to have found this team that I trust!! I hope I don't need them again, but if I do I will absolutely be calling Rudy again. Check out the before and after!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8oDxFJti1fQMkqOOMoyJyjAgE2DYHgxN5mozf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa1RGVFqopFZc61ITaJF2Gc9w6GmLbQEVHYF2K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great job! would recommend Adam to friends and family. Ridding around with key scratches was definitely an eye sore but adam assured me I was no longer going to have to worry about it anymore. I'm glad I found car body lab. I'd recommend them to anyone. Great job guys💪🏾< /text>

<text>Jason was the repair technician for Car Body Lab and I was very impressed by how he repaired my car... in my garage!!! My white Honda Insight had damage to the front bumper and side fender. Jason was very professional and worked diligently for over 6 hours to restore my car to look brand new!! I was emotional seeing the final result!!! I would definitely recommend Car Body Lab! They were communicative, punctual and professional with a solid work performance!< /text></record>

The online scheduling and estimate process was very convenient. It was refreshing not to have to waste time with numerous phone calls to get the work I wanted done clearly communicated and scheduled. David the technician was very courteous, professional and he arrived early. The pricing was reasonable and there was no surprise about the cost when the job was completed. The car scratches were removed without incident and to my utmost satisfaction. Simply an all around Great outcome!
Thank you!</review>

My rear bumper got smashed in when hit by a Van.  I started searching for and auto body shop and came across Car Body Lab.  I requesed an estimate which was a very simple process just sending a couple photos and filling out the information of the make model and year of car could not have been any simpler.  Within 10 minutes I had this great estimate, which I accepted and had an appointment set for just a few days later. The technician arrived on time and was very knowledgeable.  He answered all my questions and was very thorough and  professional and very kind. My car looks great. Can't even tell it had been damaged.  This was exceptional service. I will definitely use again and I will recommend to all of my friends and colleagues.  THANK YOU, CAR BODY LAB.

<text>Super impressed by the service and quality of work delivered by Car Body.  I had several scratches on the passenger side trim of my 2020 Tesla Model Y.
Car Lab service works exactly as it says - booked online, received confirmation of appointment in minutes, and technician arrived 20 min. early of the timeslot.  Quality of work was perfect.  I'd use them again in a heartbeat!<//text>< username>

Jacob did a great job replacing my bumper. He was on time and the whole process took around 2 hours including matching the paint. Very much recommended.<//Text>< username>

Pros:
• Technician showed up on time
• First technician was friendly
Cons:
• It took a total of 6 appointments and two technicians to complete and the final product looks like someone spraypainted it.
•Tech forgot tools
•Tech polished before letting the paint dry causing the whole job to have to be done
•Tech didnt have time to apply clearcoat so an additional appointment had to be scheduled.
• Tech didn't cover car getting excess paint alongside whole side of car, and rims.
• Tech left a big gash on a panel that didn't even have damage on it to begin with
• Tech didn't sand properly leaving tiny but visible bubbles.
• First technician did a good job matching paints but didn't take care of the body work properly. When the second technician redid the job, he didn't match the paint as well leaving a dull finish.

Summary: It's cheap, but you get what you pay for. It says they are hand-vetted certified with years of experience. The first technician was brand new. Management wouldn't take responsibility for the situations making the excuse that they are just contractors and not actual employees of CarBodyLab. This experience was based in Orange County, CA.<//review>

<Response>{'time': 1614460930276, 'text': "Hi Josh. Thank you for your feedback. I checked with our customer support team and it's my understanding that our company accepted responsibility and sent a different technician who rectified the imperfections in the original work done on your vehicle. Last we heard from you, you informed us you were satisfied with the final result. The pictures you posted appear to be from prior to us sending the second technician.\n\nThat being said, I personally contacted you yesterday but have not heard back from you. We want you to be happy with our service and if you still feel the work is not satisfactory, please feel free to get back to me so we can find a resolution"}< /Response>< gmap_id>

I was getting very frustrated with companies that wanted to charge me $1,000 for small areas. They wanted to repaint the whole side and I wasn’t about to pay for that. I came across this company and I submitted a quote and in around a hour I got a quote. For every including corner of bumber and two areas on the lower sides of each door was way below what anyone gave me. I love the results every thing came out great! The only thing I wasn’t happy about is that I ask them to be very careful to not get the paint on the garage floor and when they left the was paint all over on the floor. I wasn’t happy about that.</text>

<Review>Car body lab was so convenient to use, to be able to download pictures of the scratches on my car and get a quote as quick as I did was great and the quote was much less than I thought it would be. Add the convenience of them doing the work right in my garage was terrific, Jason did an amazing job and you can’t even tell there was any work done or scratches to start with. I highly recommend this service to anyone who needs scratch or dent repair, I will hopefully not need them again in the future but if I do I would definitely use them again!<//Review><user>106834222554170888633< /user></record>

<name>Twiirlss T</name><time>1606303563335< /time><Rating>2< /Rating><text>I hope you have time because this will lengthy in detailed . I reached out to carbody lab for repairs on my right fender/bumper . I agreed to bring my car to the technician because i couldn’t have the work done at my home . On 10/03 I was told by Nelson my repairs would only take 6hrs . I dropped my car off at 10am . The technician didn’t reach out to me until 7:17 to be exact telling me the car was in the drying phase . I asked if I could come get it while I had a ride and he said yes . I drove an hr to pick up the car only to find out that the clear coat he put on did not dry properly and it needed to be refinished . So I let him keep my car as he agreed to drop it off the next morning . He didn’t bring me my car until 10am . When I got the car it appeared to have been fixed but after paying close attention it still was not as they promised which was “a factory finish” . So I reached back out and requested it be fixed AGAIN . This time I was told that technician would bring me a whole new pre finished fender . He agreed to bring it to me 10/7 @5pm and install it . He didn’t show up until 7pm. Unfortunately once he was finally finished I was in a rush to leave so I really didn’t see the final install . The next day I noticed the paint on the fender  was much darker than the rest of the car . I proceed to inspect the car and noticed the bolts from the undercarriage/splash guard was missing . And the bumper Protruded from the car. It doesn’t even stay in. I reached out to Nelson on 10/15 telling him about yet another issues . He assured me the bolts would be replaced . Today is 11/23/2020 and I have still not heard from Nelson . I said all that to say don’t go through these guys or if you do , do it at your own risk . This whole process was such a headache and a lot of my time was wasted . Not to mention the money I had to pay for the repairs and it’s not even finished to factory finish like they guaranteed.  I wish I’d just went to a traditional body shop and I’m sure my car would be good as new . I can’t recall the technicians name but he lives in new port richey Fl first Initial is D and I do not recommend him , he’s not professional or prompt at all.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I contacted CBL because of their high ratings. Their process was very quick & easy. Caesar was my technician. His work is excellent!  He did an outstanding job on my car! Caesar was courteous, professional & fast. He also helped me with what I thought were rims. He explained they were wheel caps & where I could purchase more.  I’m so very pleased with CBL & their employees! If necessary,  I would  definitely use CBL again & highly recommend them to family, friends & anyone in need of their expertise!<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

My 2019 GLC300 was scraped and gouged by a concrete light post and I could not live with it.  Car Body Lab was quick to respond, did the work at my home, was friendly and professional, charged a more than fair price, completed the work in a reasonable time frame and when they were done, I was amazed at the quality of the work and the outcome. I would highly recommend them to anyone and would definitely use them again for for any future repairs.<//text>

All I can say is WOWOW.  I had them take care of all 4 of my cars from deep scratches to full bumper re paintings.   I literally never thought this would occur and I would live with the scratches forever.  Their guy came and in two days literally made all 4 cars look new.  You would never even know our cars were 5 years old.   This service makes fixing your scratches and even minor dents easy.  The person they sent was a literal perfectionist, he even wanted to make sure it was polished just perfect before he left.   Use this service, worth every penny.<//text>

Hector Gomez met me at our lake house. Understand this is not your typical PDR repair. This is true auto body work! Hector did a great job. 100% happy with the entire process and experience. Hector is even going to do a follow up in a few days. Excellent service. Great job.< /review></record>

<Text>I couldn't believe how easy it was to repair the dent in my car! I had been dreading doing it because I thought it would be such a headache. After getting quotes from different body shops, they all wanted to charge more than Car Body Lab did AND I wouldn't have access to my car for several days while the repair were being done.

Getting a quote and making an appointment were super easy, they arrived on time, completed the work in the time they said it would take, and the result we great! I would definitely use the service again (though fingers crossed that I don't have to).< /Text>< pictures>

I first contacted this company back in December. I was provided an estimate for my car and with estimate was told I needed to make payment towards parts immediately. I did. I have been rescheduled now 3 times. Just today I had a 9 am appointment it was changed to 11 am. I was then texted at 11:20 that now arrival time would be at 12:30. I have a job a child in school am busy.   I am now told “things happen “ I understand things happen but for 2 months really.  ????? Still waiting</text>

<Text>Wonderful experience.  The technician was very professional and explained the entire process.  Once completed the car was back to a factory finish.  I will continue to use Car Body Lab when needed and have already reffered them to two coworkers.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>I was very pleased with the service provided. I got exactly what I asked for which was a next day appointment in the morning, The technician was set to arrive in between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. and they arrived at exactly 8:00 a.m. on the dot. They cleaned up my driveway as well as vacuumed my car. I will definitely recommend this service to my friends and family<//Text>< Response>

So I had a deep scratch on my new Jeep.  I just couldn’t live with that!  So trying to stay home these days I looked for a service that would come to me to repair.  This was the way to go.  The service was amazing!  Came out looking like nothing ever happened.  Thank you!<//review>

Great Experience. I was never aware this service existed until I stumbled across them on google. I got a quote fairly quickly and was scheduled for the next day. They quoted me significantly less than what body shops quoted me and the repair was completed in one day. All of this from the comfort of my own home.</text>

<UserId.>115852173894455177054<//UserId.><Name>Catherine Wong<//Name><response>None</response><review>Over the years, my car accumulated a ton of dings on the rear door because the parking spots at work were super tight (a few of them were probably of our own doing from our second car too). It was such an eyesore that I finally wanted to do something about it, and I found Car Body Lab from a Google search. I'm impressed by the easy interaction. All you need to do is upload a photo, they send you a quote in like 15 minutes and then schedule for the service. It was super convenient for the technician to come to our house to work on the car, given wfh. The technician did a fantastic job and communication with the Car Body Lab team has been great as well. I highly recommend them. I wish I found them sooner.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>5</Rate><Date>1601780483720</Date><gmap_id>0x80c2c6358395394f:0xeea83e07875097c7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Honestly, the pictures don't even do the work justice. Omar and Car Body Lab knocked it out of the park. I'd wanted to do some work for a while now on my car, but the prices at dealers or shops were so expensive for only a third of what I wanted to get done. Omar and his colleagues did a stellar job, and I would refer Car Body Lab to anyone in a heart beat. On the operations side, Nichole and her colleagues worked with me on schedule and helped make this all possible. My only complaint is that most of the coordination is done via text. I realize that's the new order of service, I just wish a simple phone call every now and again. Otherwise, if you're looking for a spot, this is it!</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<text>The process to have them give a quote and schedule was seamless. The work was great quality and they showed up on time. The reason I didn’t give 5 stars is 2 razor blades were left on my garage floor (I have 2 young children) , a random box of bolts was left in my car amd the dust was horrible all over my trunk and in the garage.<//text>< rate>

These guys did great work on my car. Their service is mobile and hassle free. I needed body work done on my fender and they were able to book me in pretty quickly and send a technician to my home. My technician was Brian, a young fella, he showed up on time and was very polite. He's a perfectionist and pays attention to every detail. By the time he was done, the car looked brand new. I'm a big fan of Car Body Lab and highly recommends them to anyone who's looking to avoid going to a body shop and wasting their time and money.</Text>

Very happy with the service!! This is an amazing option if your car is still running and can still use it without having to haggle with your insurance company to add in a rental reimbursement. Bumper and fender replacement was all I needed and it was all finished in one afternoon!! Francisco was super friendly and informative during the repair if i had questions.  Highly recommend CarBodyLab!!<//review>

Their ad says they would be 1/2 the price of a body shop but they were four times the price. I got for a quote from a body shop. It was a small shopping cart ding and they wanted $400I definitely think you should shop around this is not the place you were going to use.<//Text>

I recently had the unfortunate luck of having a shopping cart run into my vehicle.which gouged my baby..Car Body Lab took my info and pics and set me up within the week.the repair that was done made it seem non-existent and the color match was phenomenal...my color was "habanero" so that was hard one...the easiest part is they come to you..what else can you ask for...10000% satisfied< /Text>

I must say I was very impressed with the quality of work performed by the technician sent to my house. The best part was I didn't have to go anywhere. He came right to me. Was very punctual and finished in less time than quoted and the quality was flawless. I would highly recommend them if you need body work/ painting done to your car.</Text>

<Review>When I was first introduced to this company I was surprised at the very affordable repair cost. The affordability was great but it made me question the reliability of the repair due to its low cost. Regardless, I decided to get it fixed by them. I had two dents and a crack which required me to replace the whole plastic. The result was spectacular. The color matched perfectly and no one would have known there were damages on the spot before. Brian who repaired my car showed great professionalism and I would recommend him and moreover this company to anyone.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

So affordable!! I got a quote from a body shop for nearly $2k and it was gonna take them a week! I got my car back from car body lab in 6 hours and less than half the price. Highly recommend and will use them again in the future.< /text>

I had an awesome experience with Avenue Body Shop. Someone hit my car. I went to these guys and they instantly fixed it. All I had to do was give them the insurance information from the person who hit me and Car Body Lab took care of everything. My alignment was messed up, too, so I had them fix it. Talk about making a bad situation with someone hitting you and then making the repair part so easy and stress-free. Thanks to Avenue Body Shop, I now have a car that's like brand new again and runs perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend!!! Thanks for fixing my car!!!< /Review>

The company was very straightforward with the pricing and kept in touch along the way. I was looking at a few different companies for a paint job to fix a scratch on my car, and I’m glad I chose Car Body Lab. The job was done well, it didn’t take much time, and the price was as reasonable as you can find. Overall, great experience< /Review>

I had my bumper repaired in Houston on my Mazda. All the work was done in my garage at my house. The work was convenient with an amazing quality, and at a great price. You can’t beat that service. So happy I went with Car Body Lab.<//Text>

Some low life shot my car with a pallet gun n it left a deep dent a the paint came off, I went online to looks for and urgent paint repair i was hetting quotes from few places n the price was just too much, I came across car body lab n they were very quick to act on what was going on ,  2 days later I booked an appointment.  The guy that came to fix my car did a very professional job n it didnt take that long for my 2020 charger to come back to life . Thank you car bosy lab<//text>

Car Body Lab came through when I accidentally grazed my neighbor’s bumper backing out of our narrow driveway. The tech was able to remove any trace of the scratch and perfectly match the color. The convenience and value of the mobile service is unbeatable.< /text>

Paint used was nonflexible paint on my bumper. So as heat and slight bumps happen the paint will definately crack. Not very high quality. It only lasted 1 year for me. Then when i contwcted they do not honor their warranty</Review>

<review>I was Leary at first, but this seemed to be a reasonable option against having the car in a body shop for weeks for a seemingly minor repair. Especially being a BMW who knows how this could have turned out? Renee showed up this morning on time, was a clean professional well organized technician. He got right to buisness with no nonsense. The end result ... for a fraction of the price from a body shop , the incident never happened! Color matching and clear coat is PERFECT! He left my garage cleaner then when he arrived, I could not be happier! I tried to find something wrong and simply could not!If at any point you need something like this done I highly recommend car body lab and further recommend asking for Renee if he’s available! Thank you for making my day Renee! From Keith!< /review>< gmapID>

STOP! If your not going in a shop they can’t do a perfect job. HAPPEN TO ME. Given no discount. They even tried to charge me more than my quote. They said there was frame damage they couldn’t see. BEW AWARE of that fine print. If you wanna go cheap and get an ok job that will look better use them.

Had to wait with the mechanic 1.5hrs while they tried to figure out how I was quoted 3 different prices by them. $1000 $1500 and $1300< /Text>

Excellent!  I had some front end damage.  They set up an appointment (then tolerated me changing it 5 times).  They sent me the techs name in my conformation email.  The tech was on time did all of the work while my car sat in the drive.  The tech did an amazing job.  Paint matched perfectly and you could not tell anything had been wrong, or fixed.  Prices are fair and I doubt you'd find a lower price at any other body shop. Great customer service!  Will definitely keep in my contacts in case needed again!<//Text>

Saw an ad for Car Body Lab / Driveway and thought to myself, "If the repair comes to you, the cost for this must be insane!". Boy was I wrong. I sent a couple photos through email and within a day they responded with a quote that was 88% cheaper then the quote I got at a local body shop. I booked it. The day came and Brian called me right on time and got right to work. Brian also respected my space (6 feet) and wore a mask during the duration of the job. While he was working, I tried my best not to bother him with constant questions but it genuinely concerned me that I was paying so little for something that would've costed me an arm and a leg. I get a call three hours later and it was all done. It was faster then a car detail. See for yourself. When taking the after picture I even forgot which side the damage was on. I'm a customer for life! TIP: Get Brian if you can. I don't imagine repairs getting any better than this.<//review>

<Review>Don't waste your time and money at the body shop - use CarBody Lab. Because they don't have the overhead of a typical body shop, you're looking at prices 30-50% cheaper than a body shop with the same quality of work. You also end up saving more because you're not stuck leaving your car in a body shop for multiple days. They are quick, great prices and friendly. Jose Vargas in Miami fixed my car and he was so kind and helpful. Highly recommend!</Review>< pictures>

Nelson was very professional and very kind. When I made my appointment I was scheduled for 12pm ... he arrived 10min early and went straight to work. He explained everything to me and made sure I understand the whole process of what was going to take place. I car was done in less than 2hrs and when I saw my car I was very pleased. You can’t even tell where the chip marks were.  Nelson is awesome and very good at his profession. Thank you so much ! 😃😁</Text>

Marshall did an amazing job! Super helpful from the start, pulled my car in since I was working from home and was in the middle of a phone meeting when he arrived. The paint matched the pearl white perfectly (little shimmers and all) and the car looks the same as it did before the scratch 10/10</Review>

A drunk driver hit me just after the clock hit midnight on New Years and left some decent damage on my front bumper. Other shops quoted me $1500+ to replace and repaint everything and I was not having it. I found Car Body Lab via Google and decided to give them a try. Billy and Todd came to my home and within 2 hours had my car fixed. Their work was excellent, looks like brand new, and the price paid was 1/8 of what I was quoted at a traditional shop. I’m thoroughly impressed and would recommend Todd and Billy, who are subcontracted by Car Body Lab, if you’re in the Tampa Bay Area.<//text>

<text>HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY!

I wish I could give higher than a 5 star rating!
Nicole was attentive, professional and followed up with all of my questions and concerns promptly. When my property manager denied my request to have my car serviced at my residence due to unavailable space, Nicole had me booked at a location that could service my needs the very next day! My certified technician Juan, arrived on time and had the job done in two hours! I thought there was a catch because they quoted me $1,000 less than the 5 previous auto body shops I went to but I assure you there’s no catch and Juan did an incredible job! I can’t say enough about this company! I’m a skeptical New Yorker, who just moved to LA and a perfectionist who has high expectations for any service I’m paying out of pocket for. Anyone who knows anything uabout auto body repairs knows how difficult it is to do an inner-panel blend on a paint job, Juan matched it perfectly! Seamless process, they send you a quote within minutes and you’re set and ready to go! This is a small company that won’t be small for long with this kind of service! I’m incredibly happy with the way my repairs turned out!</text>< Pictures>

I provided my home address and they said the work would be performed in my driveway. When the technician arrived he told me he couldn’t make the repair because his truck also needed to be in the driveway. I was only informed that my vehicle needed to be in my driveway and that they would need access to electricity. The technician never introduced himself and had an attitude.

Normally I write either good reviews or no reviews but I am so disappointed with the work they made that I need to share my experience with them as great reviews was a reson why I used them. Firstly they mismatch the color and painted my doors using wrong color. To correct this error they wanted to paint other panels so the difference will be not so visible... Additionally to this the finish of the paint is very very bad. You can clearly see a difference between a original panel which is smooth and painted one which is rugged. The technician would lie to me from day one: when I noticed a difference in color he said that it is normal he just need to come other day to end the job. They did very poor job in covering other panels and surrounding area. I have paint inside door handle, on the bumber and on the car of a neighbor. They did not responsed to my complaints. All this cost me lot of stress at the end I have funny looking doors.<//text>

Carlos was my technician. He was amazing!!! I had some scratches on my rear passenger side door and he made them disappear. He was very knowledgeable and professional. Nicole also made the inquiry and booking process easy.<//Review>

<Review>Firstly I don’t write reviews, I really don’t but this deserved one. Car Body Lab sent someone to fix a minor scratch on a new Range Rover. Due to unfortunate circumstances the tech caused a significant problem to another part of the car. At that point I thought I was screwed with a substandard company even though the reviews from their home state of California were top rate. I sent an email the same day and called the main company. The owner Rudy was immediately in touch as was Nicole from their office. Not only did they fix the problem they went above and beyond to ensure I was happy. Their new Tech Sam came and put everything right to a main dealer quality. To say I am impressed by their response and behavior is an understatement. The quality of work for the original minor scratch was easy to fix but the quality of customer service by the owner himself is something that is not so easy to achieve. Car Body Lab are exceptional and I have no hesitation in recommending them and in particular Sam to anybody in need of their expertise. Nick Hughes</Review>< pics>

Also very cost effective, definitely cheaper than repair shops with a “physical address” where one has to wait a day to get the job done! Mine only took 2 hours and without leaving the house! Highly recommended<//Review>< Pics>

I can’t say enough good things about this company. I needed a quick repair to a rental after a piece of rubber flew off a truck in front of me causing damage to my bumper. 🤦🏼‍♀️   Rene was excellent. Very professional and his work was flawless. I’d definitely recommend them!<//review>

I should have known it was too good to be true. I got a quote to refinish and repaint rear corner panel, hood and front bumper.  When Deanardo left for lunch I noticed that he only taped off the quarter panel and hood, when he returned i asked and he said the front bumper was not included. I showed him my proposal and he looked in his paperwork as well and apologized for missing it.   I asked him if that was going to cause any problems and he said no.  B4 he left for the day I noticed some rippling on the hood.
He said it would level out, but if it didn't to just text him and he would come back.  It did not level out, so we set up a time for him to come back.  Upon closer inspection, the front bumper was obviously rushed and not refinished, just repainted, and he left 7 overspray spots on my car; so when he returned I showed him and he said no prob.  Before he left he informed me that he cracked a trim piece but that he ordered the part and would replace it. When he returned to replace the part he broke I showed him an overspray spot that was still there & he told me I needed to contact Car Body Lab to set up an appt.  When he returned this 4th time he was very short and said that this job has been a nightmare and that he did the front bumper for free.  I told him that i showed him the paperwork and the bumper was included and he said it wasn't and he did it as a favor.  I said that he needed to address that with his employer and snapped and said he doesn't work for them.  We argued back and forth and I went inside and contacted the office.  It's been over a month now and my bumper has still not been addressed.  The lifetime guarantee is a complete sham.  If it seems too good to be true...IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!

Also, he showed up an hour past his 1 hour b4 & after time allowance.< /text>

Highly recommend!  Sent the pictures of the front bumper scratch that I needed to fix and received an estimate back within a few hours.  Worked with me to set up a location site and completed the job in less time than quoted.  Prices were fair and reasonable -   I was quoted twice as much from another company.  Excellent job and you can’t even tell there was a scratch ever there.< /Text>

Great, affordable, and super convenient! Jack scheduled my appointment with Ruben, the technician. Ruben removed a large dent from my bumper and painted it with a matching color that he mixed himself — I was very impressed! Once he was done, it was like this accident never happened. Seriously, ALWAYS consult Car Body Lab before calling your insurance company or a body shop.< /Review>

There were numerous dents and some of the scratches were very deep. Car Body Lab had me looking as good as new in just a couple of hours and at a very reasonable price. Wonderful work and would absolutely recommend them to anyone.< /review>< pictures>

<Name>jose gomez< /Name><text>I love this service and highly recommend it. I am tired of haggling with body shops and, frankly, feeling ripped off. I needed some minor body work done recently, prompting me to solicit quotes from a few local body shops. They told me I would pay over $2k — a stupid amount of money for minor work. I was pissed. A friend of mine in LA told me about Car Body Lab.

The process was transperant, easy to use, convenient, and affordable.

The work quality was great. Not sure what Marco and his team did, but that dent is gone!

Thanks Car Body Lab — consider me a customer!<//text>< Date>

According to law this is illegal In many areas. There are so many safety concerns.  There is a reason painting is done in a body shop. Spraying chemicals that don’t eventually go through a filter but go into the open air is dangerous and unlawful. I’m surprised google allows companies that perform illegal activities are allowed to advertise.< /text>

<user>112931397134304047891<//user><username>Chris Quach< /username><Date>1573416019975</Date><rate>5</rate><Text>I call CarBodyLab on 11/06/2019 and scheduled an appointment with Nelson over the phone in California because I needed to get the trunk molder, front bumper lip scratch, and the top front bumper dent repaired and Nelson quoted me $445 so I told him that I just wanted to get the trunk molder repaired and he quoted me $245 for Saturday which was 11/09/2019 at 2:00pm. Next, Nelson was able to help me find a technician named Marshall Matthews that works in Texas because I live in Texas. Yesterday, The Technician Marshall, texted me that he was on his way to my house around 10:45am and he came right on time and when he came I asked him how much will it be to get the bumper lip and the top bumper dent repaired and he said at first it was $150 and he lowered it down to $100 and I told him ok let’s get that fixed for the total of $345. After, everything was completed The Technician Marshall, did an awesome amazing job on the painting and the paint match exactly like the original paint on my car. If I have any other damages on my car I will used this company in my future.< /Text>< pictures>

I was in LA for work and needed an immediate service to fix a rental I had to return before heading back to New York. Despite their busy schedule, they were able to squeeze me in the same day. Ruben was very professional and his work was flawless. I returned the car to Avis no questions asked. I wish a service like this existed in NY.< /Review>

<Text>Don't have car body work done by anyone else! Marco is not just a technician-he's an artist! Our 2013 Elantra was hit twice in a Von's parking lot plus I scraped it backing into a three-rail fence! Now our car looks brand new! Plus-Marco comes to your home to do the work and does it better than any body shop we've ever been to! Marco is also very friendly and kind! You'll really like him-plus his work is flawless!

If you look closely, you see dust particles on paint job since it is done outside. Reasonable prices. Great for older cars and if you dont care about a perfect job.</text>< pics>

Reached out to Car Body Lab to get a quote for my Toyota Prius that I accidentally scraped. It was a minor scratch on my bumper and I didn’t want to go through my insurance to avoid a rate increase. Car Body Lab got back to me within 5 minutes with a quote and scheduled my appointment with Ruben. The communication was great from end to finish. The day of the repair I even got a notification with a link to track how far the technician was from getting to my home. Ruben worked his magic and the car looks as good as new now.<//text>

<review>Came today to repair a small chip on my trunk.  After he left I noticed several scratches on my trunk and bumper along with paint splatter on the other side of the trunk.  They caused more damage than they fixed.  Will be back to hopefully fix it but I would hope they send someone else because Refugio did a horrible job.

Update:

3 stars now because Refugio did fix all the issues after 3 visits.  Why it took 3 visits is another question.  The issue was ultimately fixed.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<username>Kathy Dufour</username><Review>Tech came on time and did great work. Price about same as maaco but was able to get scheduled much quicker. Convenient to have done at house and did not need to relinquish vehicle over multiple days.  First pictures before and last is after. 2013 Ford Transit Connect. Mini cargo van hoping to convert into camper van.<//Review><user_id>114979936467413804449<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

They have a decent menu and the best part is that they're open later than most places. I had the salmon poke bowl and the California roll and it satisfied my craving for sushi. I really recommend this place if you're looking for some quick sushi or a poke bowl!< /text>

I really recommend this place if you're looking for some quick sushi or a poke bowl!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnat7s7E9MVV5c48TcLDAiWzTu7gGQsLFM_B2i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

I tried them on the spur of the moment me cause they had a drive thru.  I was taking a chance because we never eat Japanese food and I wasn't sure if my family would like it. They loved it! Didn't try the sushi only the other dishes.  Would definitely go there again. The food was very good!< /review>

<review>Got the tonkotsu ramen, salmon poke bowl, and rainbow roll. All dishes were amazing! The fish was soft and fresh. The ramen broth was flavorful, and the egg was cooked well. Definitely recommend!</review>< Pics>

Very impressed with a spot that tackles so much (sushi as well as poke burritos and ramen PLUS THEY GOT A DRIVE THRU Y'ALL) and yet maintains such high quality. The Energy and Sunset rolls are fire, and the appetizers are no slouches either. Another sushi spot to impress the homies with😎</text>

The very best sushi spot in California! The ramen portion is large so make sure you have someone to share your delicious rolls with, which you should also definitely give a try! My favorite sushi rolls are the ones that have asparagus and cream cheese in them, so the Super Philly was the absolute highlight of my meal. The Kaiba Roll was very unique in flavor and well made as well. My boyfriend ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and while I usually prefer Miso Ramen, I ended up trading bowls with my boyfriend halfway through xD The Bluefin Carpaccio was also so great with the ponzu and mayo drizzled over.<//Text>

My 1st time visiting tonight and more in the future! Thank you Kaiba for being open late on a Sunday (till 1230am). Bought a Tempura Shrimp Crunch Roll and Sushi Burrito.... both were VERY delicious, great portion, good prices, and well packaged for drive thru service. The guy working drive thru was very friendly and welcoming. Posted 2 photos. Thank you Kaiba!< /Text>

Customer service is beyond a 5 star rating, as well as their rolls! Everything was done in a timely manner we took about 30 min here from start to finish. First sushi restaurant I've ever seen with a drive thru, if you are craving sushi this is the place to go!</text>

< Review>
This is a great small little Japanese eatery. They replaced a sushi place we used to visit frequently and it to my wife and I too long to try it this place, but once we had dinner there, we went back the very next day for lunch; they're that good.

Their menu is a bit small, but everything on it, that we've tried, is good. The jalapeno bomb is probably the most average item on their menu, and it's very good. The crunchy asperagus roll is one of my wife's and mine's favorite roll of all time. If you haven't tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and stop by.</Review>

Love it here. The spicy miso ramen is my favorite. Love that they have a drive thru. Everything is fresh and it's always bustling with guests.< /review>

Excellent food quality, large portions, fresh sushi! Can't go wrong. This place was such a pleasant surprise!! Nice staff, very accommodating. And the food was excellent! We had fried soft shell crab, crispy spicy tuna, yellow tail carpaccio for starters. Everything was so big and flavorful. For main course, tonkatsu ramen, salmon burrito, tempura and sushi burger. Excellent! Everything's was wonderful. Note: the bun of the sushi burger was the crispy rice and the French fries were tempura sweet potatoes. So extra light & crispy-highly recommend! This is a wonderful place to eat!!< /text>

I ordered over the phone @11am, they said they open @11:30am, they still took my order saying my food would be ready by 11:45am, it wasn't,  I had to wait for 25 more minutes, food was good, the service not so much< /Text>

<review>We ordered a Tuna Sushi Burrito, Spicy Miso Ramen and Takoyaki.

Staff was very attentive and quick.

Tuna Sushi Burrito: Flavors and texture were on point. The rice was a thin layer but not too thin where it broke. The garlic chips and 2 sauces as a dip was a plus. We ordered a Super size and shared, still very large portion.

Spicy Miso Ramen: It was not very spicy, broth was good but nothing unique. The noodles were way too much, so much we barely got any broth. The noodles were also weird, not the right noodles used for Japanese ramen. They used Chinese egg noodles. They also give you only half a soft flavored egg. What a tease!

Takoyaki: Yummy! They had the right sauces and I love the Bonito flakes!</review><user>107135160095019803258< /user>< Pictures>

Not real authentic Japanese food. I think it’s American fusioned. Feel like something I can cook myself at home.</Review>

28.39 for this much drive thru sushi. They asked for tip... if the fish was somewhat not store market fish I would be inclined to give a higher rating and an actual tip, but what sets it apart from McDonalds or Burger King? Nothing<//Text>

<Text>Tonkotsu ramen and Takoyaki. Got everything to go. I liked that the noodles weren't hard and ready to serve. I liked the takoyaki as well and they give you a lot of sauce. But, I feel like the takoyaki is overpriced with only four balls.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Based on all the reviews I was excited to try this place out. Interesting menu choices from sushi, ramen, udon, salads, and burgers. We got the ramen, fried chicken, the free gyoza (via yelp checkin), and a caterpillar roll. The best thing was the roll. The ramen was ok, but seemed to be lacking something. The broth felt overly fatty. Fried chicken was also ok. And the gyoza was ugh.

Right in the middle of our meal all the lights turned off. I thought we had a blackout for a moment when all of a sudden one of the waiters starts shaking a tambourine. Then party lights started flashing and the wait staff sang happy birthday to one of the customers. Once it was over all the lights came back on. Never seen such a show at any ramen place before.

The building looks like it was an old Taco Bell. Complete with drive-through. The parking is ok but you have to watch out for the drive-through cars. No wifi is offered here. From the outside the place seems a bit shady.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.<//Review>< pictures>

Food was good but a bit pricey for what it is😔. The sushi isn’t the best I’ve had but it gets the job done. Not the worst but definitely not the best, bit disappointed since this place was very highly recommended to me by one of my friends. My thoughts are it’s a bit overrated but I can see the appeal🙃.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This is one of my favorite places! The food is amazing, and fully customizable. They genuinely care about food allergies etc and will bend over backwards to ensure a positive experience. The spicy miso is the best I've had, and paired with a mint lemonade and some sake, it makes for a great evening. Their COVID response has been great as well. The drive-thru makes it very convenient to order ahead and pick it up quickly.</review>< Pics>

The service was nice even though we got there close to closing, they didn't rush us. The food was good. And it was more then what we expected. The price of food was worth the quality and the amount. They didn't even say anything about us having a happy meal from somewhere else for our son.< /review>

<text>I always go to this restaurant and the service is usually great, but my dad told me he went today and he was disappointed because he says a guy who was taking the order from him was rude. When my dad was almost finished the guy rushed my dad and took his plate away and he wasn’t finished eating, he also brought the check very quickly as if he wanted my dad to pay right away and get the hell out of there quickly. I’m writing this review for my dad as his English is not very good and he doesn’t know how to use the phone very well to write a review.<//text>< pics>

Had a good experience here after a friend recommended it to me. I ordered the mild Tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles. The ramen itself was very delicious and with extra noodles was definitely full by the end of it. My only problem was that the broth was too salty for my taste. They have such an eclectic menu that I will definitely be returning however.< /text>

<review>My wife and I love the foods here, it's one of the top Ramen and sushi restaurant in the area. There are lots of other closer sushi places but it's worth the extra 30mins drive from our place. The service is friendly most of the time.  Would be 5 stars if the sashimi plates are more consistent. Sometimes it's super out of this world good (see picture), and sometimes they're  a bit disappointing scraps of fish with the skin left on them and the pieces are smashed. For the price,  it's just not right (will post pictures if it happens again, want to stay positive).  I would order them everytime we dine there,  but for that reason I'm afraid to because it ruins my whole dinner and experience there. Also miss the 99cents beer, now its twice that for a small mug.  The Ramen and rolls are always looks good and they are delicious (5 stars). Oh and they have a drive thru, unheard of for a great sushi and Ramen restaurant.< /review></record>

Super plus for me personally. And also that was they offered to box our left overs themselves. Such a great, kind way to grab new customers loyalty, in my opinion. So simple to do and at the same time not part of their job so that was greatly appreciated. Must try! Highly recommended.</review>< pics>

Pretty good value, the staff were all pretty friendly.
We ordered a sushi boat, that came with teriyaki beef and chicken, California roll, and dynamite roll, assorted tempura, and gyoza.
If I was going to say anything negative, and this is just me being picky its that the batter could be lighter on the tempura, and the teriyaki sauce tasted differently then I was use to.
Other than that for around $40. it was a pretty good deal.
Give them a shot if you live close by. Would I drive out of my way to go back ?  Maybe ??<//Text>

Delicious. We chose take out because we needed to use the restroom, but love the idea of sushi drive thru. Eating in looked like a lot of fun as well.</text>

A good friend brought us to this restaurant, didnt seem like it from the outside, but good food, great service! Especially liked how fresh and succulent the tuna sashimi looked, tonkatsu ramen was flavoursome and definitely try the spicy seafood yakisoba!<//text>

<text>Food was good except they forgot my ramen. Im giving a 2 because they didn't know how to handle the situation. My hand was raised for probably 1 min and they were just looking at me, I guess they were discussing which ramen I got. Cancelled my order because I was running late for my flight, but they brought it out as soon as I cancelled it. By this time I lost appetite.

They didn't offer to give it to me for free, didn't ask because I was just busy worrying about making it to my flight.</text>< pics>

<review>Delicious! The quality of the food was amazing and the prices are hard to beat. Hands down one of the best Japanese food I've had in this area for sure. I had the Kaiba  boat and Ramen. The only minor complaint are the young servers. They could be taught a little more manner and learn how to improve on their customer service a little bit more. Not that they were bad; they were actually decent but if they had some more experience this place would be the only place I would dine out at when in the area. Other than that, 5 stars!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I knew this was highly rated. But its an old drive thru building. So wasnt expecting that much.

Sushi is fresh, prefect temperature, and boy the thick cuts. Didnt look that great but tasted really good.  And the sashimi combo comes with real wasabi (frozen), not the chemical paste we normally get. That was impressive.

Even the spicy miso ramen was superb. One of the best i have had.

Met everyones expectation. Great service. Superb sushi and ramen. And not expensive.

Ok rolls are a little on the chunky side. But good value for money.

Cannot ask for more. 5 guys, over ordered with beer for under $120!!< /review></record>

<text>Disappointing. Huge drop in quality on product and increase on prices. 5.95 for 5 pieces of gyoza? Ridiculous. I got the rainbow roll and it tasted room temperature with little flavor. Sad to see the quality go down since last I was there.< /text>< userid>

I paid $16 for a roll I ended up not eating because they didnt tell me over the phone that the roll they suggested had cooked salmon. I'm all about raw salmon. It was super fatty roll. Couldnt get myself to eat it even though it was pricey af. Wouldn't come here again.<//Text>

<resp>None</resp><Text>The GF and I have been faithful Kaiba customers for many years now, I'm surprised I haven't written a review before this point. The service is always friendly, the drinks are always cold and the sushi is always good. I love the large menu they have. From sushi & sashimi to Ramen and teriyaki there is something  for everyone!

Honorable mention to the brussel sprouts,  Monkey Brains, and sesame chicken.  The appetizers are all amazing and can be a meal by themselves if you like.

Did I mention the sushi burritos and burgers? How about the $1.99 Sake? Kaiba is the spot to eat, go there and find out why!<//Text>< time>

This is one of my favorite places to eat! A lot of people discount it because it has a drive through but that shouldn't stop you. The custom service here is excellent, your food order comes quickly, and it is always delicious. My go to items are the dragon roll and the tokantsu ramen. This place used to be a burger restaurant. Kaiba came in and used the Drive thru to its advantage. Even through the drive thur you get great service and great food. The o ly thing is just because you're going through drive thru don't expect fast food speed. It takes a bit longer than an average drive thru does but it's definitely worth the wait.</text>

< Review>
It has really nice service, very friendly, but when it comes to the "extras" they used to have like the free small samples of ice cream and the variety on the menu I think it was better before when it was named "maki sushi". Not sure if it is under new management but most likely that's what it probably is,  but I liked it better before. Food still good but did not impressed me, and price wise i feel it is slightly pricier than before.</Review>

< Review>
This is my go-to sushi restaurant. I stick with three items, although there are plenty other options. My top three choices are 1) Jalapeno bomb, 2) Salmon Burrito (warning, the large stands up to its name, and if you want to eat something else, do yourself a favor and order a mini), and 3) Crunch Asparagus. I often pair my meal with their $2 draft Sapporo that is so cold there are ice chips floating at the top. Be sure to do a Yelp check-in for a free starter, drink (non acholic), or ice cream. The staff is friendly, and most often attentive, but they're working on hiring more people, so this should soon be remedied. Last fun fact, they have a drive thru. Yep, a sushi joint where you don't even need to leave your car to order.<//Review>

Their spicy miso ramen soup is delicious. Their drive-thru menu does not show everything they make. When you get to the drive-thru window ask for a paper menu because this place is worth going back . you can also enjoy indoor dining.</Review>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>This used to be Maki Sushi that our family visited on a monthly base for over 10 years. The new owners have redecorated the interiors which look great. The menu has been re-vamped which is good, but we do miss the bento box meals. Although I like to support local small businesses, we may not be coming here as often as before.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
Have been going here for almost 10 years . Changed hands listen here ago and we recently went in there.  My wife and I for dinner and before dinner ordered one tall bottle of beer and asked for 2 glasses and he said that he would have to charge for the 2nd glass. I always do this to keep cold, then order 1 more sometimes 2 more,  I told him no way get the manager so he did and 3 other people came back and I told him this is never happened to me before and I'll be the last time.  He said he would wave at this time I said well you can wave good bye to me cuzz I will never  come back.< /review>

<Review>Really liked the new place. $0.99 beer special all the time, and the rolls are large but cut to a good bite size. I tried their ramen and it was very good. I have been here 3 times so far, once inside and twice I used their drive-thru. Everytime I have been happy. I just wish they had some sort of customer loyalty program in place.< /Review><user>116177663141269265888<//user><Time>1497464775167<//Time><Name>Ryan DeVaul</Name><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Good ramen. $.99 cold Sapporo. Cannot beat it. I come here often for lunch. Don't eat meat and asked to switch the pork for an extra egg instead. No go. Disappointed but all good.</Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Food is decent for sushi, it's not as good as sushi joint down the road, but for drive thru sushi you should have your expectations set accordingly.  The main issue is the service through the drive thru window, I have been here at least three times, and 2 out of those 3 times I waited at the window for about 20 minutes with nobody greeting me or charging me for my order. In fact most of the time I don't even think they know I'm here even though I just spoke to them through the speaker. Even more frustrating is at the window you can see the workers standing around chatting with each other.</Text>< GmapID>

So disappointed a few months back when all of a sudden this place was where Maki Sushi has been for years. It was THE best. Honestly this place is barely ok. Compared to Maki Sushi it sucks.< /Review>

Delicious! We came last week because we found out this place changed ownership. We are here again! Unlike the previous reviewer, I think this place is way better than Maki Sushi!! They serve a little of everything on the menu, but I particularly love their ramen! It's just Spicy Miso or Tonkotsu here, but they are both good. My husband loves their poke bowls. Their ice cream dessert is to die for. Overall, great new place. Expect us to come back again!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Most successful restaurants don't just up and close down, so I don't know what that says about Maki Sushi. I was never able to try it. Kaiba though, is really good. Their prices for rolls and nigiri are very comparable to other local sushi places like local chain Orange Roll and Sushi and Kampai in Los Alamitos. The rolls are pretty substantial as are the pieces of fish you get when you order nigiri. The ramen and sushi burritos are also really good. I definitely feel like I get my money's worth when coming here and the food tastes delicious. Add in the great service I've received and this place is awesome. Love this place. Just my two cents.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) One of the best places I have eaten, excellent service and very rich food, just one detail that the sushi I ordered was too big and too thin it was difficult to take it to eat it, but everything else very good.

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) In general, the food tasted good.
The salmon pork that I ate was great, but the sauce was a bit spicy and a bit sour.
The donkotsu ramen was also very delicious, and the sesame chicken and squid meat were delicious.
