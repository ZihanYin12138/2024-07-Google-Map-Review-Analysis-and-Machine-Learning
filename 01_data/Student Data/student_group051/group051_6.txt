They turned the restaurant into a supermarket! It's awesome! The veggies look very fresh and they have just about everything. The best thing here is the giant aisles!!! You can shop without crowding with all the grannies on Stockton St.

Oh and they have some dope snack selections 👌👌👌< /text>

This was the best dim sum I had while visiting San Francisco. The service was good and the location was close to a couple of parking garages.< /text>

Fast cart dim sum service. Seems to do alot of local regular business vs tourist. Huge stage and balcony for second floor seating. Was probably really fancy at one point. Pretty dated now. Bathrooms were stinky and dirty. Also lots of stairs to get to them. Staff is curt but efficient. Speaking chinese to them helps alot here.  Food is fantastic.< /text>

Very decent dim sum and Cantonese food. Clean and good service. Each Thursday night at 8pm,  a young pop singer, Mimi, performs at the restaurant. Really enjoy her voice. You cannot find such performance at each restaurant. Have been there a few times.</Review>

<user_name>Li Li</user_name><Date>1547054411842< /Date><rate>3< /rate><Text>Love the dim sum on carts, arriving steamy hot, tasted just as expected. Very crowded at times, with servers talking loudly to each other. Chaotic and disorganized environment. Tables and chairs were set tightly, So, you have to be super careful in trying to sit down without bumping the chair behind you. If you need an attention to order more drink or pay your bill , you must spend sometime looking around or wave or grab anyone attention because they seem to be on some kind of missions, excluding customer satisfaction. We were not sure who was our waiter. The bathrooms too need serious attention concerning cleanliness. Overall, it was ok experience. My preference is for somewhat calmer and organized establishments, with more attentive servers. So, if you wish for a relaxing good time eating dim sum, this is not the place for you. However, if you do not mind the noise and below average service, then, enjoy.<//Text>< Pics>

Reasonable dim sum house. Great variety of items.  Best peking duck in a bun. If you want extra, best to order a whole duck with buns and take extra home. Ask them to put duck bones in separate take out box, so you can use for soup stock. Enjoy!< /text>

<review>The food was great though I didn’t know what it was. Most of the staff don’t speak English but it was fine. They come by with carts of food and you point at what you want and they stamp your card. You get a lot of food for the price. I went at lunch time though.<//review>< pictures>

Came here for a party.  Dirty, dirty, water glass.  Attempted to wave down a waiter, made eye contact and he walked away.  Wow, cleanliness issues and extremely disappointing servce, or lack of any decent service.  Wonder if the health department or any government agency ever been here recently.< /Review>

a lot of chinese banquet meals are held here. the food itself is honestly pretty mediocre, but i can see it as an easy event venue if your company is trying to host a large number of tables. (i went to one that seated around 800 people)<//review>

Don't expect anything fancy in this large venue, nor the deferential welcoming you may expect from any above-average restaurant. The staff can be a bit curt while accommodating you, and the servers may not be particularly fluent in English. However, service is swift and efficient, and for dim sum all you need is to point at what you'd like to try (or you can still easily order a la carte). The place is especially suitable for medium size groups and for families. And very reasonably priced.<//text>

Closest thing to an authentic large dim sum restaurant I experienced in china. There's smaller places around the area that give you a different feel, but if you're looking for a dim sum place that has thousands of carts going around you at once, give this place a try. Go around 11am - 2pm. Food was aight.< /Text>

Food is ok but the restaurant is very noisy and always full. If you wish to eat here for lunch on weekends, try to come at 11 as the place.Will be packed quite quickly. Service is good though and food is served through carts.< /Review>

Traditional dim sum. Got to figure it out.  No English. But if you don't speak out they will give you the 20 dollar dishes.  Look for the bamboo dishes.  Don't get fished on just the highest priced things.  This place is for locals.    Got a try.  Be well vacationsensei<//Text>

Be warned the meat plates are not necessarily hot due to being carted around, but certainly cooked.
Basically you flag down a cart, point at a plate, and it's added to your tab.  If you want more than one of the same plate, and you don't speak much Chinese, just hold up your fingers to indicate how many you want.  It's not the best place to spend too much time at the table, but it was more than worth the experience.  If you just want one or two plates or something it's cheaper elsewhere.  Best to bring friends as it's more worth the amount of food and experience you get,</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

Food was pretty good, but service sucks. My partner and I were almost finished when he stepped into the restroom for a moment. A server came over and told me I had to leave because someone was waiting on the table. They even tried to grab the untouched custard bun off the table. I tried to explain that my partner would be right back, but they insisted I leave anyway. Unacceptable.<//Text>

<review>[from July 2006]

I was just at New Asia for a friend's wedding and -- though I was very happy to share this special day -- I wish I had been equally happy with the food.  Instead, it was bland and utterly uninspiring.  The McD's of dim sum.

The faded/peeling wallpaper and the soiled napkin originally placed at my table didn't exactly set a charming ambience, either.

Service was decent, sound system was fine.

But -- and true, this isn't the restaurant's fault -- whatever you do, DON'T PARK AT THE LOT HALF A BLOCK DOWN!  In big print, I saw "$2 per 30 minutes."  Okay, not cheap, but not bad.  Imagine my surprise and disgust, then, when I was told "$25".  Then I noticed the fine print ("$25 from 4 hours, 1 minute and onwards.")  I was parked for 4 hours and 7 minutes.  Bastards.<//review></record>

<Text>TL;DR: Go elsewhere. Expensive & bad food.

Low quality food (shrimp dumpling that has a hint of sourness, Shumai that tastes of old meat) with an extremely rude cashier.

Would skip and go to any other Chinese restaurant in the area. There's plenty for you to choose from and the prices here are no where low enough to justify the bad food. The interior is also very off-putting and borderline unclean.< /Text>< pictures>

Also, the demographic is the older crowd and they serve dim sum the old school style with the push carts. The dim sum is average and the service varies. The interior also needs some up keep as it feels a bit dirty and dated with the old tables and chairs.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I went here a long time ago when I was 13 and I loved it, decided to go here again when I have limited time in SF. Worst decision. my friend and I were only obvious non-asians there and we got the worst service. Food was always cold including the hot dishes. 40 minutes after our table was cleared did we actually get our check even though we kept asking. Finally we just decided to get up and go to the host lady in front, I left a tip on the table even though it was not deserved. And the rudest woman yelled at me for leaving it at the table. Then she rounded up our total bill just because? THE FOOD HERE IS NOT WORTH THE RUDENESS OF THESE PEOPLE<//review>

The atmosphere is very unique. It appears as if they offer live music on occasion and have a lot of food options but I didn't like the food much. It all tasted very bland and the plates and silverware didn't looked like they were cleaned all that well. But I have heard good things about this place so take my words with a grain of salt.<//Text>

We paid a lot for what we got. Dim sum were okeyish but not the best. The duck came with almost no meat, only fat and bones. They didn't even let us take the detailed check with us. I would not recommend it.</Text>

<Review>Wow, really old school bad dim sum. They have not change for decades. Most of the customers are 70 yo or more. This place fits their old taste bud.

It's a little over priced for the quality of the food.< /Review></record>

The new Asia is the first restaurant that I went to. The first here is very Chinese and correspond to the name" New Asia". Then that service is good since I call the waiter and they can call on 24 hours.<//text>

This is one of the biggest Chinese restaurants in the city. No wounder this place is always busy with marriage ceremonies ! Parking is a hassle and food is  just average.
Here is the good part: during XMAS they usually host Kung Pao Kosher Comedy Festival  "Jewish comedy on Christmas in a Chinese Restaurant." This could be a real treat!<//Review>

A classic dim sum house. More authentic (although slightly less sanitized) than Yank Sing, always loud, always crowded on the weekends. The food itself ranges between good and great.< /Text>

I went there for an event, it was so crowded that I worried it might exceed the capacity, hard to walk through. the audio system is not good enough for singing performance, the vegetable dish is too oily, I didn't stay to the end of the event.< /Review>

The food is so disgusting like you don't understand and the price for it is so overpriced there was styrofoam in my food the soup was bland. Some food were over salted while others were bland. Ground was sticky and getting a table was a struggle because no employee was at the door.</Review>

Did someone say Dim Sum?! Let's meet at New Asia!

I've been told that this place is a bit touristy but I disagree. What sets it apart from most other chinese restaurants that you may find in the area, is that it is HUGE and still fairly clean! It was designed for banquet sized events such as weddings.

This place has TWO levels. When they have tons of people they open up the second floor for customers to sit at and eat.

The food is absolutely delicious! The size of each item is oversized! You know you are getting your money's worth when you come here.

The little old chinese ladies are super friendly when they come by on their carts asking what you want to eat. If you speak canto, they are pretty fun to talk with while they are grabbing a steamer of food for you and stamping your card.

The only unfortunate part of this huge place, is the second floor. If you get there too late and get the boot the second floor, you are in a world of loneliness. They have to turn on the kitchen on the second floor, and re-organize the staff to accommodate both floors. So sometimes, the second floor gets ignored a bit. They won't necessarily pre-make all the stuff already prepared for the first floor. So you'll have to flag someone down to get what you want if you can't find it on the carts.< /Text>

Being from LA (san gabriel valley). I've been trying to fill this giant void of good dim sum. This place is always packed! I was told this was the best Dim Sum in the area, I am from LA and I still think that Monterey Park has some of the best dim sum ever! It took a long time to get a table, we were finally able to sit down and all our our plates were dirty and it took 30 minutes to get us tea. Food was ok, service was pretty lousy. This place is very large and can sit many people.< /Text>

It is a Google place to experience local chinese enjoy there dim sum morning tea.
Lots of fresh items. And rare foods most Americans do not eat. Weekend morning tea
Is clouded.
It is good to share a table, if you do not wait to wait long.
My favorite ju hong (pig blood) fong jou(chicken feet) cow and pig stomach.< /review>

The food is pretty decent, if your looking for authentic chinese dim sum, it is a good place to go to, but not very good. The decorations are pretty nice, it looks pretty authentic to the restraunts in China. The service is really bad, the waiters sometimes will ignore you if you try to get their attention, that is the only bad thing about the restraunt. I would recommend New Asia if you are looking to try some chinese food.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This restaurant is suitable, and many people like to enjoy the tasting and gatherings come to this restaurant. The waiter is also good and polite to the guests. The food is fresh and the taste is good. I hope to continue to work harder.

In the evening, you can choose a variety of dishes with moderate taste.

<Time>1561907621645<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) Chaotic restaurant with a new service concept. (I'm not an asian food expert). Employees drive with carts through the restaurant and you can choose from things that are priced differently. Since we are in Chinatown you should set yourself up for a little communication with hands and feet. The food itself was very good. The staff, despite the high Wuselfaktors very present. Prices really fair. I would recommend. But it is not for a candlelight dinner provided that is not clear yet.

Wuseliges Restaurant mit einem mir neuen Servierkonzept. (Bin kein Asia Food Fachmann).

<Text>(Translated by Google) Outside hui, inside well ...
Very large DimSum restaurant which is always well filled. Definitely go at noon and not immediately take the first best dishes from the carts. Green tea is free. However, you should not look too closely at the premises and in the early afternoon whole groups of buses are being carried through. The DimSum were very good and who dares can also try chicken feet.

(Original)
Außen hui, innen naja...
Sehr großes DimSum-Lokal das stets gut gefüllt ist. Auf jeden Fall mittags hingehen und nicht gleich die erstbesten Gerichte von den Wägen nehmen. Grüntee gibt es gratis. Man sollte sich die Räumlichkeiten allerdings nicht zu genau ansehen und am frühen Nachmittag werden ganze Busgruppen durchgeschleust. Die DimSum waren sehr gut und wer sich traut kann auch Hühnerfüße probieren.< /Text>< userid>

The short: The 5 star reviews are absolutely correct. This is the tint shop you are looking for.

Had my wife brand new 2020 Q7 tinted last week. To keep it short, I am very particular about our cars especially window tint. We just moved to Roseville last year so I obviously we had to find a new tint shop. I did some research, called around and got a few estimates. The moment I found A+ and saw the reviews I thought, "there's no way" it can't be this good. Well when they were able to get us in SAME DAY, offered me a loaner shop vehicle if needed and was the best price of the three others...I could not be more happy with the results! We had literally everything tinted including one very large window that I know would be challenging (along with thinned to remove some existing tint) and I expected a few flaws. Again A+ proved me wrong! Tint is flawless, better than what we expected and the customer service was outstanding. As long as we live in Roseville A+ will be our new tint shop and will be the only choice when asked who I personally recommend.< /Text>

I dropped it off before work and he called me right as i was getting off work that it was ready.

Went over information and care for the windows.

Will be bringing my wife's car soon.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgxVmjjP-RGOiKJpdZsl2_nVrRO1Z-vEw-exPq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Excellent customer service! Staff went above and beyond to show appreciation since I am from out of town. Showed up without an appointment but they were still able to get my car a full window service in a decent amount of time. Very impressed with the finished product! My car looks so amazing! :) Definitely a 5 star overall!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>A+ Window tint, worthy of the name. I called to schedule a future appointment and called me back when there was a cancelation and move my appointment, give me a loaner car. The tint installation looks great. If you need quality service look no further.< /text>< Rating>

Great service and great work. I was seen the same day I called and they even upgraded my tint for free when they didn’t have the one that I originally wanted. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone wanting to get an amazing tint job done for a reasonable price.</Text>

They were an absolute pleasure to do business with! I inquired for a quote on Tuesday and they were able to get me in the very next day! I've contacted other companies and they were all saying it would be about a month until I could get my windows tinted. Highly would recommend for any tint work!</Review>

Amazing amazing work. I know nothing about window tinting. You could tell me they just paint the windows black and I’d probably believe you (okay I’m not THAT bad) but A+ did a beautiful job on my car. From the immaculate shop, to the pristine “loaner car” (that looks like it’s cleaned after every user) to the beautiful work I’m really impressed. Never felt like I was being up sold or pushed into anything (which would have been easy to do as I know so little.) I did a lot of research and I’m so glad I picked you guys for my car. To anyone on the fence-tint your windows, go with A+ and listen to the guys in the shop, they’re pros! Truly grateful and HIGHLY recommend!! Thanks guys!!<//review>

Slavik helped me out today when I was in a real pinch. I needed my window tint removed because I was selling my car the next day and he stopped what he was doing and helped me out in a time of need. It’s been a while since I’ve experienced such amazing customer service and he definitely sets the bar. I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a job done correctly with friendly, honest service. Thank you Slavik! I will be back again and again.

I was able to get an appointment for next day. He worked around my schedule with picking up my daughter. Superb customer service. Finished the tint at the exact time he said it would be done.
Would highly recommend! Also, would highly recommend clear windshield tint. Makes a world of difference with the heat.<//review>

So far since this was done just a few hours ago I rate them a 5. The gentleman who helped me this morning around 1015/1030 am was very kind. He/they did a good job on the tint. I'm happy this far. If anything changes I will do a update. But for now I would recommend them for sure.</Text>

<review>I wouldn't recommend any other tint shop over A+ tinting or even recommend another shop at all. Best product/pricing/quality work/timing/customer service.

Slavik is a hard working, perfectionist who takes each job personally.  He went the extra mile for my wife’s car and appreciated his attitude.  When I had an issue, he was very accommodating even though it was my mistake, he made time in his schedule to darken up the sunroof and didn’t charge me to do the removal.   Highly recommend him,  Steve in Grass Valley<//text>

A+ Window Tinting did an excellent job on my car, I called them over the phone and they gave me a quote and took my car the same day. When I got there I was informed on the types of tint available and chose the best one that works for me. It looks great and very clean, good customer service and very professional!<//review>

I went in to get my windows tinted to try and keep as much heat and UV rays out as possible as I am expecting a baby, and they were very informational and honest on what was going to work best for me which we really appreciated. It turned out so beautiful and they did an excellent job for a much better price than I found anywhere else! They stayed extra late to finish up just for us and even tried getting out some of the dog hair that was stuck in my backseat which was so incredibly nice! We were very happy with our experience there, wonderful customer service!</Review>

I took my Audi S8 plus to get my windows tinted and they came out perfect. They opened early for me so they can finshish by the end of the day. They had to strip the lighter tint that was already on the car and put the darker tint that I requested. They did a great job.  Plus they gave me a loaner car so I didn't have to wait around. These guys are the best.</review>

Just had work done for the 2nd time from this place, the experience the second time around was just as good as the first time! Does quality work and in a timely manner. Both times I've been there the guy(s) working seem pretty busy but both times my vehicle was done same day.

If you're needing windows replaced and tinted, I'd recommend hitting up Exceptional Auto Glass, right across the way from A+, to do the window replacement, then the guys @ Exceptional will walk your new window(s) to A+ for tinting. Got a windshield replaced, tinted, in 3 hours time.

This si the only place I'll go for all my tinting needs.<//Review>

If you're looking for a local place to get your windows tinted then you need to check this place out. I called to get a quote in the morning, and they were able to get me in the same day which was great. I was explained the different tint options that were available and pricing was clearly explained. The finished product looked great and I felt the price was competitive with other tint shops. Definitely give these guys a shot!</Review>

< review>
I met with Slavic late afternoon to inquire about window tint for my 2019 370 Z. I wasn’t sure which shade or percentage of shade I wanted, so Slavic took time to explain each shade percentage in addition to offering carbon tint which is a superior product which I wasn’t even aware of. Based upon how flexible Slavic was and willingness to accommodate my schedule, I was able to get the job done that same day. I  was able to watch him in action and was amazed how Meticulous he was with each detail of the prep and application process. The windows came out perfectly and I could not have been happier. I would recommend Slavic without exception especially if you own a high-end vehicle and want it to look perfect. Give him a call as his service and prices are exceptional. Thank you Slavic! You did an amazing job and my ride looks showroom ready.<//review>

I called in at 12:00pm to inquire about a quote to get my truck tinted and not only did the owner take his time explaining the available options he gave me a quote over the phone.

He asked me when I wanted to have them done and I said how about today? He said that he doesn't mind staying late to finish the work and had me drop off my truck at 4pm and supplied a rental car to get around town until he finished the job!

Excellent pricing and great customer service I would highly recommend A+ Window tinting!< /Text>

I just want to thank A+ window Tinting for a phenomenal job and service on my truck. Absolute top notch professionalism from all employees. I am as picky as they come with someone taking pride in window tint, this place exceeded my needs while doing it at a reasonable price. Thank you again, if you need your windows tinted go see A+ in Roseville.</Review>

Literally just walked out of their shop after getting my Fiance’s Civic tinted for Christmas, and I am so amazed at their incredible work! Not only did they finish it very quickly (just over an hour!) but the windows look absolutely flawless and not a bubble in sight. I will 100% go back there in the future! He also took the time to explain to me all of the features of each different shade and I was very impressed. 10/10!!!<//text>

Fantastic place to have your windows tinted!
They have the best price around Roseville. The guy was super cool and let me borrow his personal car while he tinted my windows. He gave me a free upgrade and even did the job fast. Simply the best around! A+ all the way!</Review>

I have had two vehicles tinted by Slavik with ceramic tint. The first one was done 3 years ago and looks as good as the day he did it. Slavik, is not only professional but knowledgeable and stands behind his work. I would recommend everyone to come here.< /review>

Their service blew my mind. I came by to get a price quote on fixing a tint job I had done before in Lemon Grove. The rear view window was bubbling badly because the low-quality tint film was slowly letting air in whenever I ran my defrosters.
Slavik gave me a fair quote for the fix and, because I had a few places I still needed to get to for the day, let me use a loaner vehicle while mine was being worked on.
The final results were “A+” indeed! High quality film, no residue from the other film and looks factory-installed. They were also able to save my defrosters by getting the old film off without a razor. Great results and service, would definitely do business with them again.</Text>

<Review>Made a reservation and he was waiting for me. I stopped it off for the owner to work on. My truck was super Dusty so the owner took extra time cleaning my windows so the tint wouldn't scratch. I had a few bubbles the next day in one of the windows but went away the next day. He said he would redue if I want happy about it.</Review>< Resp>

It's a neighborhood liquor store where you can pick up soft & adult drinks, candy, and some basic goods in between trips to the big box stores. Friendly staff provide a good environment on the inside while it's a bit rough on the outside. One of my favorite marts close to home.< /Text>

< Review>
Whoever run this company is unprofessional and rude. I am an owner of one  the property they used to manage and i ask them to provide me with with docs of my property. I talked to a person who seems to be the owner and he was rude, disrespectful with aggressive language. I was calm and trying to understand what i need to do in order to get docs of my property prior I bought where at that time they have to be managed by them. Do not deal with such people they dont care about you as much as they care abut getting their %

when a person who suppose to deal with tenants and landlord telling you " i don't want to hear your crab" when you are asking a normal question on how can i get the docs... then you can tell how professional they are!<//Review>

He was rude and loud when we told him that we could not assist him with the information he was seeking and that he needs to contact the right party and request it from them. He kept us on the line while other clients were waiting. He is upset because we could not assist but he failed to realize that we took the time but could not address his concern since we were not a party to the real estate transaction .'}<//resp>

I am very impressed with the staffs and they are responsive in emails and prompt to return calls and they handle my paperworks and applications in a very professional manner. I have been doing business with APM for about 20 years. The owner Leon Pham is a very nice person and aways ready to help you with any issue. He is a great and awesome guy to do business with.
I am very happy and please with APM.

< Review>
Our property management lead, Leon, says what he means and means what he says. He's been reliable and up front with us on expectations throughout the process. He does not over-promise; he delivers upon his promises.  No organization is perfect; we did have one repair from a third-party vendor double-invoiced, but APM ratified the error, quickly.  It's the response to adversity that's more important than untested promises, and APM came through.  We can't in good faith give higher than a four Star review because we have no other property management company experience with which to compare to APM; thus far, we're not looking to replace APM.  APM is performing above expectations.</Review>

<Text>We switched to APM because we lost confidence with our previous property manager. Not only that APM offered better pricing, they were the only company who answered the call immediately when we called. We spoke to the broker and were assured that they would be able to assist us with an ongoing mold issue. The transition was smooth and the maintenance staff has been very helpful. Thank you.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Some of their checklist includes things that need to have professionally done for example like a drape/curtain that you never use and kept on storage and getting  carpet cleaned when it was never cleaned before moving in. They make you do all these cleaning and you have to pay out of your own pocket to get the place clean. They even mention about painting the walls! I know some places own by them and the house have holes, patches , cracks they don’t even fix it so the people that’s moving in is basically have to do extra cleaning themself. This just upsets me because one of my friend is renting from the management and to me I feel like they try to scam you to do things for them when it should be their problem to do it!<//review>< Pics>

<text>They took care of our property, 212 union city for over an year. My husband and I are very pleased with their services.
We found them to be reasonable, trustworthy and honest.
Their fee wasn't the lowest and we were enticed by few other PMgr's but these guys have our trust.
We finally decided to sell the property and they were professional about it. No hassles at all.<//text>< pics>

APM deserves 6 stars. I was referred to them by my real estate agent after I was frustrated with my previous property manager who failed to properly respond to my questions and concerns about the new rental law. Leon is very knowledgeable with the laws and he answered all the questions I had in 1 phone call. You don’t have to take my words for it. Give them a call and you will find out. I was sold after Leon was able to address all my questions that I was concerned with but never got straight answers from my previous property manager. My agent has referred clients to APM for 30 years and said that they are the property management company which many real estate agents in the area referred their clients to.<//Text>

I am an owner and was really unhappy with what happened recently my place was rented for 18 months when I told them in emails for one year and even the amount for the rent didn’t go up to what I said in the email it was totally ignored. I don’t like to rent my place for more than a year at a time especially when I told them early on I was thinking about selling it. Not knowing when you sign a property management agreement that they have the right to do whatever they want with the lease or the amount because you’re given them permission and I didn’t see it until after I signed the property management agreement the amounts with the 18 month lease.  So if you’re an owner and thinking about going to this company you better make dang sure about the amounts and what the lease is before you sign anything. They have agreed to take a hit on the rent for the next 18 months out of their maintenance fees but I’m still unhappy with 18 months and the whole thing. I was told the other guy that did it has a lot of rentals well then he should be doing a different job if he’s not paying attention.< /text>

This is my second property management company. Unlike my first management company, I really like and appreciate the works they did for me as the owner of the house. They listen to me and provide very useful information to me whenever I got questions. The team has demonstrated the highest professional standard in answering calls, responding to emails etc..
I recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a property management company to take care of their rental houses.
Keep up the good job!!< /review>

I already tried renting two great and affordable homes here and both those times affordable property management take down their application for that certain home when I clearly told them I will apply tomorrow in the morning and the secretary approve and said they haven't received many applications. I was so interested in this home I could provide my family with but once I was ready to apply the listing was gone so I call their office and a man answers saying that they have too many applications in and that was the reason they took down their listing. I am really upset with this management and how they handled my situation. would not reccomemnd.<//text>< user_id>

This is the worst agency that I ever seen in my life. The staffs are rude and unqualified and they are just a bunch scammers whom charge people for their credit report in order to rent the property for them, but they come up with stupid excuses which don't make any sense at all! I wish I could give negative stars to this crazy agency with their dump employers who are a bunch of crooks and waste timers.</review>

<Text>If your looking for a new place to settle with family look no further. APM’s application process, approval, and sign of lease was very smooth and hassle-free. Each and every time I have issues in our townhouse we’re renting the response is within 24 hours and they try to fix the issues ASAP. That’s what I like most about. They are also transparent and clear about the terms and conditions of the lease. I would definitely recommend APM.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

APM services always have an excellent services in every area of their work. I have been a client for the past 7 years. I never had any issues at all. Staffs are courteous, very professional and go an extra mile. It's hard to find a business you can trust. APM is a rare breed that you can trust and so I can sleep well at night.<//Text>

I never leave reviews  even if I have a bad experience. I called in to ask a couple of questions and moving in time frame and she got all short and had a very RUDE tone. Why would you want to have someone like that as your property manager? You're supposed to sound welcoming and make people want to live at your property not keep them away from it. Work on your people skills and maybe you won't have so many complaints. Or just get a new person to answer the phone that will treat everyone with respect and not cut off you off on every sentence. Good luck.< /review>< username>

It there was a lower point than one I would have given that. This is a money grabber place. Although they checked our credit score last Thursday, they asked this morning to check the credit reports for my adults kids, and a couple hours later they refused our application. Thats very stupid because they knowingly took our money.

Please stay away from this place worst place in Fremont.

They deserve no points at all!!!!</Text>

Affordable Property Manage is a processional company that is customer centric.  Properties for rent are fully descripted in lisitngs and the rental process is through but not overbearing.  The rental contract is reviewed with the tenant and service requests are handled in a timely manner.  All communications are cordial and we are kept informed owner and managelment needs.
I highly recommend Affordable to my friends and family</review>

They don't want you to see certain units and this is because they are old and outdated. Windows that barely open and walls so thin you can hear the neighbors TV, bathroom, baby crying and other things, they never fix what they say, said they would replace old window coverings instead had someone come clean them and they broke them up because they were old . stone with no knobs, no screen door, they are horrible and don't follow or enforce any rules they have you sign<//Text>

Terrible experiences with them on multiple properties. Their office hours are very limited. In order to see a property you can’t call to schedule beyond 24 hrs, they are not available on the weekend when most people are off of work and they can only show a property between the hours of 9am to 3pm M-F when most people work. This is an inconvenience and has deterred me from working with this company in the future.</text>

Unpleasant staff. At first they act nice but once you are a tenant they are atrocious.  I always paid on time (auto withdrawal ). Every time I needed to discuss an issue with the depatment I was met with resistance (only about 4 times in two years). I don't understand why since I was a great tenant.

I moved out after 2 years and they want to charge for paint - $800.  I took pictures when i moved in and I hope you do too. The paint was mediocre when we moved in.

Also they want to charge $120 for two lightbulb replacements and a PLATE that I overlooked on the porch and didn't pick up.  That is an interesting charge to say the least.

Oh well never refering anyone here ever.<//text>

These are horrible property managers. I lived in a property that they managed for two years, and spent the last year of that waiting for them to fix my refrigerator while continually being billed for furniture removal in the garage that was there when I moved in, thermostat adjustment on a thermostat that they had replaced AFTER they received a bill for an adjustment, among a hoard of other things that were never fixed or fixed properly. It took months for anything to get done, and a couple times I had to hire an attorney so that Leon would stop harassing me and sending me frivolous bills.</text>

<text>The guy Leon made me feel worse about about my stupid tenant situation than it was,. I have to take care of this stupid tenant thing in my own, all I wanted was a custom property management plan from this company and it wasn't going to happen to help me talk to the stupid tenant when I arrive in town on 4/27,.  I have a bad vibe now about property management companies in general and I have to take care of this tenant on my Union City property 420 miles away, ridiculous, stupid, and a waste of a conversation<//text><Rating>1</Rating><pics>None</pics><username>A.

<Review>I completed an interest form online and was contacted the same day to schedule an estimate. The estimate was completed on-site the following day.

I have two skylights, a main floor balcony/deck, two dozen floor to ceiling sliding doors, other windows, a side and back deck and a driveway. I hired Ascension to clean all of the windows of my home (inside and out), as well as the screens and frames. Also included in the task list was my two skylights, as well as pressure washing of all of my exterior flat surfaces (decks, balconies, walkways and driveway). I also had an exterior deck resealed.

The guys from Ascension were professional, courteous and efficient. The job was completed more quickly than I expected, and my end result is excellent. Super happy with the job performed.< /Review>< gmapID>

<Review>Ascension did very much effort to accommodate our window cleaning schedule due to our house will be on the market shortly. The job was done with high quality and the price is very reasonable. We forgot to let them know a certain area to clean, and the very next day they had someone to finish the job very well. We highly recommend this company to everyone.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x80d955bb6fb3ffff:0x8addad603045c5fb< /Gmap_id><Time>1625953658444<//Time>< Pictures>

I would highly recommend Kyle and Ian, they arrived on time, did outside snd inside windows, tracks, repaired screens, cleaned dryer vent and cleaned a skylight. They were very friendly snd polite young men and did everything I asked them to do. I will use them again for some power washing in the future.</Text>

My whole experience with Ascension home was awesome and easy. I had gotten a number of bids via Yelp for indoor/outdoor window cleaning. They were the first to respond, had super clear and reasonable pricing, very easy scheduling, super professional staff (both those on the phone and those who came out to clean) and even came back for a post rain touch up. Will be using them going forward regularly. Very highly recommend!<//Review>

Kyle did a good job cleaning our windows and screens.  He did not arrive on time, but ahead of time by an hour!  He was very professional and we are very happy with the service.  So happy in fact that we are already looking forward to our next schedule.  This time we will included our newly installed glass fence (backyard) and hopefully the inside of our windows.  Highly recommend them!<//Review>

Kyle has done a terrific job, and has been professional, and respectful of our space while working.  The windows gleam, and have never looked better, in the three years that we’ve lived here.  Particular attention given to the solar panels is an added plus, and I appreciated seeing the “before and after” pics to note the job well done, and no doubt, increased optimization of electricity from the panels.<//text>

Ascension did a wonderful job on windows for a rental I own. The windows are older and the screens were redone a year ago. They were hard to get out and back on!!. Ascension did it with ease.  Not one bent screen !! They were fast and the work took no time at all. Big Thank you!!<//Text>

Our experience with Ascension Window Washing was positive all around. The office staff was friendly and efficient. They were flexible and worked with our schedule. They also made paying online easy. John came to clean our solar panels and the many windows on our two story house. He was extremely polite, professional, and hard working. John was also understanding about dealing with our dogs, as well as the numerous family members he had to work around. John exceeded my expectations. Ascension Window Washing is hands down our go-to from now on.<//review>

Fantastic job and very professional. Wes really delivered on our Christmas light plan for the new house and made it easy for us to have one of the best looking houses on the block. From roof, to tree wraps, to door decoration, they have proven themselves and really delivered on our expectations. Thanks so much Ascension!< /review>

B.E.S.T  Window Washers Hands Down!

Wes the owner of the company came over and inspected all our windows and then washed all the rails and the edges and pressure washed the outside and even pressure washed our screens they look absolutely gorgeous and there’s some pictures attached to see. It it was a very fair price at $100 per 1000 sqft of space to pay. We’re on the second floor so they had to use ladders and long handled gear to wash our windows around outside our unit such a pleasure to work with them. We will use again next year. We highly highly recommend them for your windows.  We will never use another window washer again, the last company we used wasn’t bad but they missed the rails and screens and for nearly the same price!< /review>

Their work crew were prompt and courteous and did a beautiful job.  Other companies that we called, either never responded or came as stated for giving us a quote.

Christmas lights... it's the 2nd year they've done our lights. I love that they remind me via text every year (I need that) and this small business that was started by a husband and wife  is awesome.

Very through, went over step by step what he would be doing, then executed as stated.  He cleaned up after each element and after the gutters in particular that took just as long as the cleaning. I would highly recommend the company and John who provided our service.<//Text>

John from Ascension was a pro from start to finish. He wore a mask, gave us space and asked in what order we wanted the windows cleaned as not to disrupt our working from home. He cleaned the inside and outside of the windows, tracks and screens. He even repaired a bent screen in our son’s room. Highly recommend!<//Text>

They were prompt, professional, and did an excellent job on the windows in an Edwardian flat. They're about 20' off the ground, but that didn't even slow them down. Communication with the manager was quick and efficient. 10/10. Will use again.</Review>

We had all around an excellent experience with Ascension Window Washing.
Their immediate response to our need of rain gutter cleaning, the great communication before and after the job, and their video documentation of what was done made us feel very much at ease. We chose the right company!!. I would highly recommend them!<//review>

<review>Wes and his crew perform amazing work, and have a great eye for detail. Wes came by and cleaned all of my interior/exterior windows, as well as removing and cleaning screens, and cleaning all of the window frames and seals. Wes was in and out in a short amount of time, and was extremely courteous and respectful of my home. I will be using ascension window cleaning from now on for all of my window cleaning needs.<//review><userid>114236874034111318550</userid>< resp>

<Text>Wes and his crew did a thorough job on our property. We live close to the ocean and we had all kinds of stuff in our large backyard (algae, dirt, acidic residue, etc.), not to mention bricks which he specially treated with a power brusher! After the job, Wes called me out to make sure it was up to standards and asked if there was anything else that needed attention, which my wife and I really appreciated. It’s nice to do business with someone who is local and a native San Diegan, who makes you feel comfortable coming onto the property. His customer service is top notch and organized. If you want someone you can trust to get the job done right for any of your exterior cleaning needs, contact Wes at Ascension Window Washing today!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1568080741533, 'text': 'Thanks Jim!

Wes and his guys came out to our home and were on time, professional, and always goes above and beyond.

He wants to complete all jobs that meet or exceed the customers desires.

He cleaned our solar, painted our home, cleaned out our barn, painted the inside of our barn, and we plan on using him again for future projects.

Honest, self starter, crew cleans up afterwards, and a pleasure to work with.< /Text>

This is the second time using Wes to clean our windows and Solar panels. After the rainy winter we’ve had in San Diego our windows were pretty dirty. Both Wes and his helper were very respectful of our home, always removing their shoes and being very mindful of our pets and open doors and windows. All communication was spot on with email as well as text messages with scheduling. Prompt , efficient and respectful. We will definitely have them back again.
Thank you Wes!<//text>

< Review>
Before hiring Ascension,  I talked to two other pressure washing companies.  They were charging so much more before even hearing the job. Ascension was responsive quick and came even the same day. Hehosed algae off stucco and cleaned sewage pipe. We are going to make him our main vendor for our HOA. I would call them before anyone to save you the time.</Review>

The only place I will get my hair cut. Everyone who works there is friendly and professional. I also have a child with Autism and they were able to cut his hair and keep him calm just by being sweet and patient. My son gives them 2 thumbs up!< /review>

They don't trear their employees well so none of them stay.  Every time it's new people.  A roll of the dice.  Many times one starts your cut and someone else "more experienced" has to finish it or instruct the new person.

I asked for a trim and they hacked 6" off my hair.  They've given me 1" from the scalp long layers.  Theyve literally ruined my hair and my daughters hair more often than they've got it right.  And if you find someone who does a good job - next time you come in they are gone.

In addition 2 weeks before school on a week day they had a 2 HOUR online check in time.  I checked in.  Went there 2 hours later.  STILL had to wait over 30 mins.

Just dont.</review>

<Text>A few hours before my wedding I took my two year old to get a hair cut we waited 30 min. He’s a bit afraid of the machine so when it was his turn he started crying and two of the works asked us to leave . They said he was a liability and where not going to do his hair cut ... so they asked us to take our stuff and leave ... they didn’t even wait for my son to relax and had no one waiting to be next ..they just said we have the right to refuse service ... complete waist of time ... I went kuts kocky and they did it for free ... my son cryed a bit but the guy did a wonderful job and no one was a liability<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

They barely trim your hair, on purpose. If you want any more than a blunt cut you're up a creek.<//text>

<review>If I could do a negative star rating I definitely would. I went and asked for a simple layer hair cut. I asked for a fringe and she cut my hair so horribly. She cut it from the back to the front then cut more. My layers are literally 2 inches apart. My hair was at my shoulder length so you can just imagine how short it is now. She had no clue and kept denying she cut it wrong. My layers don't even connect! They even told me as I was leaving that the hair cut was on them. Are they serious!!!!! They messed up my hair so bad and didn't offer me anything! No fixing, no money, NOTHING! Do not go there!!!!!!

<review>Several of the ladies know how to cut hair for adults as well as children. Then there are the ladys who dont know how to cut hair & seem to think its ok to practice on my son. I tip well but am dissapointed. Kids at school made fun of my son so we had to buzz his hair. Waste of money. 2 star experience.</review>< Pics>

<date>1607622804336<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>The gals at Moondance Bridal were so friendly and made me feel super comfortable during my shopping appointment. I believe Danielle was the one who helped me try on dresses, and Anette helped me check out. I came in a month before my elopement and they quickly helped me find some dresses from my favorite designer. I ended up with the first dress I had tried on, as it was so pretty and unlike any I had seen before. My mom used her seamstress experience to take it down a couple sizes, and added buttons down the back. I felt absolutely beautiful in it and I received so many compliments from friends and family. I'm so happy I was able to find my dress here, and would recommend Moondance Bridal to all future brides. They never once made me feel pressured, they mailed me a sweet thank you note afterwards, and they even gifted me the cutest moon-shaped gold earrings with my purchase!<//text>< pictures>

I completely admire the way the owner handled the situation, and I see that this is not what the shop stands for. Therefore, I have updated my 1-star review. Though it's left me feeling skeptical about wedding gown shopping now, I do not hold Moondance Bridal responsible for Olivia's unfavorable treatment. The Moondance Bridal shop is beautiful with so many different gown options. I wish we had a different selling associate, which could've made for a wonderful experience that I had wished for. I just hope no other bride has to go through what I did and have her special moment overshadowed and stripped away from her by such degrading treatment.

Let me start by saying, I NEVER write reviews, but I owe this to warn other potential customers who are helped by Olivia. Having come from a customer service background, I must say I'm very disappointed in Olivia's lack of professionalism. She provided great assistance in the beginning, but completely changed her demeanor once I stated I wanted to walk away and think about it overnight about the $3,000 investment I was about to make. She made extremely rude remarks, "WOW. Go ahead and go research it. I even poured you champagne and took your measurements, so I thought you were going to buy it! WOW!" Then was completely dismissive to me and my guests. Correction: I said, "I think it may be the dress", not that I was ready to buy it on the spot. I was inclined to go home and think about it overnight as I had looked at two different dresses and couldn't choose, then go back NEXT DAY to order a dress. I preferred to pay cash anyway, which I didn't have on me at the appointment. And clearly, after reading other Yelp reviews on here, customers ARE allowed to walk away and go back to purchase their dress or at least with other associates we can do so. Because of Olivia's treatment, I will now sacrifice the dress I wanted to go elsewhere because I will not give money to someone who was flat out disrespectful. And after looking through other reviews on here (i.e. Brittney R.), looks like I'm not the only one that this has happened to. I just know for my business, I would NOT employ an associate that treated people that way. Customer service is everything!</Review><Rating>3</Rating><name>Ty C<//name></record></dataset><record>

Being a local wedding planner and a BRIDE TO BE, I had the most INCREDIBLE experience at Moon Dance Bridal finding my dream wedding dress. From the beginning stages of booking my appointment, to the attentiveness and knowledge my stylist provided, to trying on dresses and everything in between- the entire experience was exciting, smooth and everything I dreamed of and MORE! Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the ladies at Moon Dance Bridal for creating the magic I felt and still feel today, as I said "YES TO THE DRESS!"< /text>

I came in with zero expectations and with the mindset that I may not find "the one" that day and that would be alright. Olivia was incredibly sweet and hospitable and after just a few questions, nailed my style. I didn't really even know what I wanted! After trying on the 4th dress, I knew it was the one. No need to try on another. I said YES to the dress! Tears and smiles and one of the most memorable experiences of this chapter of my life. Everyone was so nice and made me feel like a million bucks! I loved everything about this place! My budget was respected, considered and I was even able to purchase a vail & earrings for UNDER my budget. I couldn't be happier.< /Text>

<review>The absolute BEST bridal shop out there. The shop is simply beautiful and their dress selection is incredible. Best of all - the entire staff is so sweet, so fun, and the owner, Danielle, is a one of a kinda human. They make you feel so special, are so attentive, and so patient, all while making sure you have the time of your life.
Danielle was so beyond accommodating and understanding during several moments of second guessing and indecision and I can't thank her enough for her kindness in those important moments. She truly made sure I got the dress of my dreams.
I visited them from Santa Barbara (twice) before officially choosing the one and would do it a thousand times over. Definitely make visiting Moondance a priority no matter where you are from. You will not regret it.
Thank you Moondance for hands down the best customer service experience I've ever had - from anywhere, ever!< /review>< rating>

I found my dream dress at Moondance Bridal!! I had the best time trying on dresses here! Moondance is in the cutest building and their shop is so cute! The staff was SO nice! They make you feel really comfortable while trying on dresses. They have a big variety of beautiful dresses. They were willing to split some costs because I needed to express my dress to receive it in time. I thought that was so sweet of them! Everything was super clean and everyone was wearing masks. I was overall so impressed with this bridal shop! I definitely recommend you come to this bridal shop before any in SLO County!< /text>

Moondance Bridal made my dress shopping experience so amazing! They were very kind, patient, accommodating, and made sure that none of the process was overwhelming! I didn't know exactly what I wanted and they were able to help me find the perfect dress for my body. My whole group and I had such a blast here and were so grateful to be here for the dress shopping experience. Every single lady who works here is a dream to work with and I could not have been happier! Thanks so much Moondance!<//text>

Moondance Bridal, hands down, deserves more than five stars for this review. Last week my partner and I drove several hours to San Luis Obispo for my very first bridal dress fitting at this boutique, and couldn't have felt more taken care than we had at Moondance.  Annette and her daughter Sophie really took the time to connect with us and personally guided me through every dress that was on point with my aesthetic and price range. The whole experience was well - paced and very comfortable. I never felt as though I didn't have enough time with eachdeach in order to narrow my selection and was given honest and unbiased feedback that allowed me to reach a natural decision on my dream dress.

Moondance has an impressive selection of curated designer dresses that are stunning and unique, and all within a reasonable price range. If you are considering visiting Moondance, I urge you to follow your heart and make an appointment! With all the stress of wedding planning, coming to Moondance and embarking on the dress search felt effortless, uncomplicated and got us even more excited for our wedding day. The staff at Moondance created such a special and personal experience, that will always be a memory I cherish.

Thank you Moondance 🌙✨<//Text>

<text>This is the first time I've ever written a Google review...I had to share the incredible experience we had at Moondance Bridal. My mom, sister and I drove up from Santa Barbara looking for a specific dress. We had no idea we'd arrive in such a beautiful boutique. We were greeted warmly and served champagne. Suzanne assisted us and was so friendly, inquisitive and patient. She really understood my personality and style even though she'd only just met me. I soon discovered I wasn't a big fan of what I originally thought I wanted. Suzanne listened and observed closely, bringing in gowns I never would have selected. She was objective yet encouraging and in the end, it was between 3 dresses, all stunning. I ended up choosing an Emmy Mae Bridal dress and it's absolutely stunning...so unique and just perfect for a garden wedding. The other ladies in the shop were so sweet and complimentary. The shop was feminine, pretty, bright, airy and immaculate with a stellar collection of bohemian, chic dresses, They had an adorable selfie set up and gave me a little gift bag before we left. Moondance Bridal truly went above and beyond. I'm relaxed and just not into all of the wedding hoopla. I hate feeling spoiled and I never thought I'd be interested in wedding gown shopping but I have to say...I loved it and I'll remember it as a highlight of my pre wedding journey. Thank you Suzanne and Moondance Bridal!< /text>< Pics>

My first bridal appointment could not have been better. Moondance was my first choice and I’m so happy it was. The team was so helpful and knowledgeable about a lot of the variety of dresses I was wanting to try on. The showroom is literally is what magical boho vibes are made of. It truly was the best day ever.<//text>

Not only are each of their staff members kind and attentive, but they make you feel like you are the most important person in the room.

What an incredible way to start your bridal journey with women who make you feel like you're trying on dresses with your best friends.

Wherever you are, LA, San Francisco or somewhere in between, make the trip down to SLO to find your dream dress at Moondance.</review><user_name>Kiely Crow< /user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

This place was magical! I visited twice and bought my dress the second time. The staff was incredibly welcoming, helpful, patient, and kind. They kept every style idea I had in mind when pulling dresses for me (and within my budget). Annette, Tawnya, and Suzanne were all wonderful on my visit! They were so accommodating, as I had many people attending with me. This was the most wonderful experience I have had especially compared to other places. I loved the gift bag and photobooth after I had purchased the dress of my dreams!<//Review>

My first time trying on dresses was AMAZING! The girls at Moondance are super helpful, sweet, and patient. They helped me look at a wide selection of dresses that were in my budget, then took the time to listen to my style and how I want my wedding to be. I would definitely recommend booking an appointment with Moondance Bridal!<//Review>

I found my wedding dress here this weekend and loved the experience. The shop was beautiful and the customer service was excellent. They didn't rush me or limit the number of gowns I tried on. Tawny and Danielle were so kind and made me feel special from the moment I walked in. They spent 90+ minutes helping me and giving a lot of personal attention. After I ordered the dress they sent me home with a cute goody bag.
I loved the selection of designers and gowns because I'm not a fan of the more traditional dresses. The dresses here were more bohemian, romantic and minimalist. It was great to be in a shop where I didn't have to push past racks of poofy princess gowns to find the more modern, laid back styles I was looking for. The shop also has beautiful bridal accessories! I would definitely recommend this shop to any free-spirited bride looking for something unique and laid back.</review>

Had the pleasure of meeting with owner Annette and her fabulous team over at Moondance. Aside from the fact the salon is darling and beautifully decorated they have an exquisite and unique collection of designers. I'd been to several shops prior and was extremely impressed with the variety provided. They have a style for every bride from black tie to backyard wedding looks. The best part of my experience was the kindness and warmth of Annette and the Moondance team. They made me feel right at home and could not have been more genuine and upbeat. Made the session so fun and took the pressure off that comes with such a tough decision. Highly recommend and will be singing their praises to future brides!< /Text>

<text>I don’t even know where to begin. Moondance exceeded all expectations & then some. After going to over eight different bridal shops looking for my dress, I finally decided to buckle up and drive 4+ hours to San Luis Obispo to visit Moondance & it was the best decision ever. To be honest, as soon as I opened the door to their boutique I told my mom “I have a really good feeling about today!” The ambiance & decor here is amazing. I worked with Suzanne and Danielle and they are both the sweetest, kindest, most knowledge ladies! I found my dream dress here & what an amazing celebration it was. I can’t imagine the moment feeling any more special than they made it for me. I cannot wait to go back & visit the store & the girls when I pick up my dress. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Well, being the Dad of the bride to be I wasn’t there. However when my wife told me of their experience, I had to write an absolute glowing review. The location, staff, designer, and of course the dresses made all feel so special. My wife said it was like a San Francisco experience with the friendliness of SLO. Well done Moondance, you have made my family very happy.<//review>

I could not have imagined a better experience while searching for the perfect dress! Scheduling an appointment was simple and straight-forward. Amira handed me a glass of champagne upon arrival and she was super helpful in guiding me to pick out and try on dresses. About 10 dresses later, I found the one! They worked with my timeline and impressed me with their customer service. Stripping down and trying on dresses can be very vulnerable, but everyone at the store made me feel confident and beautiful with just the right amount of guidance and input. I recommend this shop to all the brides-to-be I talk to!</Review><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
There are so many positive memories I have regarding my experiences with Moondance Bridal and their excellent staff in San Luis Obispo. I was so pleased with every aspect of each of my visits I wanted to shout it off the rooftops and tell everyone I knew all about it!

When I made my appointment, I had the unfortunate mishap of doing so in the midst of a family emergency, so while I never in my life imagined having to try on wedding dresses without my mother (my best friend in life), I had to do it on this day. I have to say though, even with all that, Annette at Moodance Bridal truly made this experience easy and exciting for me.

During my appointment, I was given the 411 on how it works, you give insight on what you’re looking for, together you will select around 10 dresses and away you will go to try each of them with the assistance of the women you booked your appointment with; in my case Annette.

While selecting the dresses, expect to heard, they will inquire about your style, listen and in return, offer options they thing think might make a statement which represents you best based on what you’ve given them. So be honest! They will encourage you to tell them “heck yes”, and even “heck no” when they present options that do or don’t excite you. I can assure you, each of them will take a genuine interest in you, as a person, not just a buyer or customer to make sure your experience goes as well as mine.

Everyone I worked with was personable, easy going and really kind. Not only did I feel heard, but my requests were respected. When I stated my budget and later showed interest in a dress which may have jumped outside of my budget, they were up front about cost and allowed me to make the call of whether to try it on, leave it out, or think it over and circle back, without any pressure.

There was no time in which I felt pushed in any way to hurry based on time, nor did I ever feel pressured to purchase anything before leaving. It's a tough decision, and they want it to be the right decision just like you do. In my experience, the women at Moondance Bridal went above and beyond taking pictures for me to share with my mom who was unable to make it that day and give advice on accessories as well as multiple perspectives to help me get closer to selecting my “top-2”!

So finally, and most sincerely, thank you so much to everyone at Moondance Bridal for all of the efforts and dedication throughout the process. Special thanks of course to Annette and Susan as well, I won’t forget my experience here and will always recommend Moondance Bridal.< /Review>

As soon as I walked in I knew I was going to find the one, the vibe is very cool and they have a lot of great styles for the more boho/free spirit type brides (and a few more traditional too). All of the dresses I tried on were beautiful, the space was bright, clean, and welcoming. The consultants were so sweet and helpful, they really knew what they were doing and made some awesome suggestions too! If you’re looking for a wedding dress in the Central Coast area, you haaaaaave yo make Moondance Bridal your first stop.<//Text>< username>

1st night good 2nd night terrible.  The room next to us someone was pounding on the door and yelling for about 1/2 hr. Tried to call the front desk but the phone didn't work.  Later around 3am a fight broke out.  Later that morning I complained to the manager about 45 min later I get a knock on my door and them wanting to know why I complained and  now they're getting kicked out. As of 3pm they have all there Belongings outside between my room and theirs just hanging out smoking. They mad dogged me when I went outside.  Did I mention the 8 plus cats that they had in The room that got out and they were trying to get them? Also the pillows were lumpy. Now that I think about it I'm changing my 3 to a 2 and that's being generous< /review>

<Text>Let’s just say that walking in the hotel smells weird like cigarettes n really bad funky smell. Bathroom was horrible the faucet for the shower is broken. And the jacuzzi wasn’t dirty and full of lint. Living room the couch has stains. Bedroom lights was different one was the LED light n the other light wasn’t and the curtain is broken. Smh never again. That room is a mess. Room number is 120.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Needs to be upgraded outside needs paint job. Room needs to be painted and wooden floors need to be replaced with new ones. TV and cable service need up grades. Along with micro waves and coffee pots old and outdated. The only thing I can say was outstanding was house service, everyday beds made and clean towels. I stayed for 6 nights and that’s about what my stay was like.<//Review>

Positive: Location is ideal; only 10 minutes from where I needed to be. It's a quiet spot with basic rooms, which suited me just fine. If you're looking for upscale living with the rain showers and wireless charger alarm clocks, this isn't the place for you. Negative: The first night we were given a room that wasn't clean, but that night only needed it to store our belongings. Hardwood floors throughout, but some warped. Microwave and fridge old with pieces broken. Lobby closed from 10:30pm, no night assistance.</Review>

I book & stay at a lot of hotels using the Star rating system on Google Maps...   There is no way this is a "3-Star Hotel"  compared to many of the places I have stayed at, it is a 2-Star Motel at best.  Something's Fishy.  Perhaps they have an insider at Google?<//text>

The room had a bathroom door that didnt lock, the door was all crapped up, an ac that leaked with a towel under it to catch the water,  not enough towels for 2 people. The people at front desk were rude.</Text>

However the guest service is motel6 style service. 4 of 5 times I have tried to reach the front desk there is no answer. When I checked in I had to call the attendant's personal cell phone. she came rushing out of a guests room. Is she providing "additional services"? That is what the perception is. They charge an extra $50 in case you decide you like the towels and sheets more than your own at home. I was told this would be refunded when I checked out. Almost a week later it has not been refunded. With my rewards level I am able to have a late check out. When I asked how this worked the attendant responded in such a way that I felt like I was asking her to provide the same "additional services" the check in attendant was providing! I'm not that kind of guy nor do I care to associate with those kind of women. Let's upgrade the service level here! The Microtel in Morgan Hill and Super8 in downtown Las Vegas can give you some excellent points to follow!</Text><Date>1595874755921</Date><pics>None<//pics><user_name>Damon Micheal< /user_name>< userid>

<text>I made a reservation through Wyndham rewards using my points and when i got there they said i have to pay instead (and will give you all kind of excuses), also they will try to charge a very high rate instead of the internet rate that you could have got before going there but since you are already there they just charge you whatever they want and since it was late i didn't have much options. The lady manager from India was also very rude and she thinks is very smart and better than you or at least that is how she made me feel, the opposite at how a hotel is suppose to treat customers.<//text><gmapID>0x808fb7afd9900935:0xf594ca88743e3d25</gmapID><Date>1590595411642< /Date><resp>None< /resp></record>

I stayed at this location for a work trip last week and the hotel was HORRIBLE. The room that I stayed in had bed bugs, I not only was bitten from the bed bugs, but I also had to throw away all of my belongings including my suitcase. When I brought the concern to the staff’s attention, I was immediately dismissed, spoken to poorly and was treated very poorly. I had to immediately check out of this place after making note of the bed bugs, and I wasn’t offered any special accommodation or even offered a simple apology. What was disappointing the most in this experience is the lack of quality service and customer care. I later called the hotel to speak to the manager because I was told he was out on business the week before, and before I could even explain my dissatisfaction I was met with yelling and screaming from the Manager and Owner. He was extremely disrespectful and rude, and passed the phone off to someone else who was unable to help. I was not expecting exceptional service from this establishment, but It was extremely disappointing and upsetting to be treated in this way given what I had to experience. If you ever stay here, please make sure you retain a record of the local Health Department’s number and formally proceed to file a complaint with the Health Department. Please protect yourself and follow best practices in dealing with this establishment.<//text>

There are some maintenance issues that I have seen in the rooms, but they don't affect the stay. The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. Overall for the price, it is a great place to stay.</text>

<Review>Terrible Hotel Ever and without any doubt my worst experience! BED BUGs!!! This hotel is exposed drastically to the bed bug infestation! even if you stay a night, you'll see rashes and bites on your body. I've been in CA for a business trip and this issue becomes a great hassle for me. Now I need to dump everything I brought with me in the trip to avoid propagating it in my home. The management is awful, they lie on inspection! They try to give excuses as much as they can to avoid accepting any responsibility or refunding you! I called them, first they hang up after I explained the issue. I kept contacting and the response I got was that inspection has been done in the room and when I asked them about the exact time, they throw time and it turns out that I was in the room exactly at that time and no inspection has been obviously done during my stay! I strongly suggest not to even get close to this awful hotel!<//Review><Response>None</Response>< userid>

My credit card was charged and the reservation was confirmed. Upon arrival, the owner of the hotel refused to give me a room saying they no longer accept reservations from third parties. He spat out that I needed to call Southwest.

This man showed no kindness or hospitality, and it came across that he was angry with ME for having booked a room.

In spite of that, trying to get directions around the place was impossible. I ended up walking twice as much as I needed to just because it was it was inconvenient for them to walk over to a window, about 10 feet and describe where I needed to go.

<text>Low cost, no frills type of place. There's a large pool but it wasn't open when I was there. My room seemed to be newly renovated with new flooring and appliances. I didn't see any hot food options for breakfast, just the typical toast, fruit, juice setup that most budget hotels have. Lots of Asian restaurants in the vicinity.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I liked the breakfast and I liked having coffee in my room. The wifi kept sketching out on me, but everyone was really helpful with getting it to finally work.<//review>

The check-in and check-out process was extremely smooth. The room was super clean and fresh towels and sheets everyday. Breakfast was great! Timings for breakfast were great too! Had a great time<//Text>

<review>Bad service but expensive price. They don’t clean up room every day. Per 2 Days they clean up your room. I feel itchy when sleeping the bed. So I changed hotel after stayed there 2 days. During I stay there completely power off in night...<//review>< rating>

So far, great.  Tommy and Kasie at the breakfast area are very polite and helpful young adults. Breakfast area very clean and plenty of food.
Rooms are clean. Can tell it's an older building but well kept. Room is big with refrigerator and coffee maker.< /Review>

Standard 3 Star Hotel. Service was quick and easy. Room was clean and adequate. Not a lot of plug-ins for phones/laptops. You have a microwave in the room but good luck fitting food in the mini fridge. Internet speed is good enough to play games on, didn’t try and stream shows or movies. Half the tv channels didn’t work, continental breakfast was decent but could use some work. No meat (bacon, sausage, ham), only option for eggs was a cheese omelet. The area where you get breakfast is cramped.< /text>

<review>The room itself was clean and comfortable and checking in/out was simple. I had a couple of issues with the room, which may or may not be just a preference issue. The first was the bed, it was too hard and uncomfortable for me and I had trouble sleeping. This also led me to focus on the weird tapping (or dripping??) noise coming from the wall/ceiling. The other issue was the water pressure. Washing my face in the sink was a challenge since there was hardly any pressure, and the shower wasn't any better. They did have a sign in the office about maintenance happening with the water lines, so hopefully it's not a constant issue.

That all being said... The breakfast was good and the staff was nice. If I could get a softer bed with them, I would definitely stay again.< /review>< name>

<Review>Great place, pool was great. Came to Cali on a school field trip to have some fun. Stayed here and it was wonderful. Breakfast was wonderful. The room was nice, however not to many plugins for electronics. (Especially if you have a few people in the room) now remember that this is a motel so don't expect the best of the best. Can be a little noisy at times, but nothing to bad. Overall, great location, great amenities, great room.

It's pretty great! 😀< /Review><username>Skyler Mcdonald< /username>< Rate>

<Review>The location was convenient.  The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious and clean.  Loved the wood floors.  Breakfast was average.  Room was next to fitness center so we were awakened every morning early by the treadmill runners making the floor shake.  The shower temperature was hard to regulate, either scalding hot or ice cold.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>The staff was very professional and helpful.  The morning breakfast and room were excellent.  The room, however, had a really strong smoke smell and had I not just come home from a concert and was too tired I would have asked for a different room because the smell was overwhelming.  I did inform the owner who said he would take care of the smell.  Not sure whether he had or not.< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< Name>

Not so liked it.  Got a descent studio bedroom with average floor, bathroom quality. Thermostat was not working well, had to manage using mai ac duct buttons..

Main issue I faced was bedbugs there.. you cannot switch off the lights and sleep, else you will be deficit with blood the next morning 😀😀

I booked this hotel because it was near yo Google, Microsoft and Amazon.

One or two days stay is okay but can't stay more that that...

Yes, you can get car parking, morning breakfast Free.<//text>

< review>
Extremely horrible customer service. Violated our privacy and right to use our do not disturb sign. Bathroom window literally falling out off the track onto me cutting my leg. The manager refused to help, discount or refund us. He refused to even talk to us about the situations. We caught some guy in our room when we got back to the hotel, after we put the do not disturb sign up. The front desk lady told the maintenance guy that he can knock 3 times and if no one answers then just walk in to fix the window and toilet. We disputed it and they refused to even talk to us. They told us to call the police and make a report. We took it up with the corporate and they were not of any help. This perused for 4 months. This hotel was disgusting, the food was absolutely horrible, and the staff had horrible customer service. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It’s not safe nor secure for kids or people to stay at. They go through you stuff when your not there. Even though they violated the security policy, there was no consequences. They should be held responsible. And we tried with everything we could to make that happen. Wish I could give them zero stars.<//review>

There was a phone in the room, but it was not connected (no wire) and after midnight, no way to contact the front desk short of using your own phone and calling the outside number or walking to the lobby.

Ask for extra pillows before then if you need them as there is no housekeeping staff to bring those by late at night.

The water faucet for the shower / bath in our room was upside down, and started scalding hot moving towards cold as you turned it on.

Other than that, it was a hotel with a firm bed and good air conditioning. We slept well and it's right off the freeway (though getting there from 101N is a bit of a janky lane change to get to the street).</text>

Location for me is about the best thing about this place. The showers fluctuate in temperature to the point it's unbearable. The middle aged lady at the front desk was combative when I wanted to change rooms because of the shower. The fridge made a terrible noise that kept me awake. The free breakfast does have egg omelets, but their frozen and there's a line for the microwave to warm them up. 1/10 will not stay again.< /Review>

From the exterior I can't be certain if I was lucky or not, but certainly my room had been recently renovated to a standard that you would not typically get in a much more expensive or prestigious chain. The stay was overall very pleasant and comfortable and (for the location) good value for money.</Text>

<Text>Sundowner Inn or as it is now called, Days Inn by Wyndham, is a centrally located Inn right off Hwy 237 in Sunnyvale. Due to it's prime lication, commuters have quick access (by car) to all of Silicon Valley. The rooms are spacious and spotless, and have been recently renovated. I found my stay very comfortable. There are also wheelchair accessible rooms with great care taken to ensure full amenities and easy accessibility features (room 107 is a great example). Mr. Shah, the owner, continues to help his staff regularly, with the vigor and vim of a person a quarter of his age , even sometimes working the front desk on weekends, where he loves to meet his guests and give them an overview of the grounds, of which he takes great pride. There is a lovely pool on-site and breakfast is served daily at the pool cabana. There is also a Greek restaurant with tasty choices for everyone. My week-long stay was excellent, and I would highly recommend it if visiting the Sunnyvale, San Jose, or surroundings.< /Text>< pics>

Got a complimentary upgrade to the King Suite. Water is softened, linens aren't coarse but are nice and fluffy, staff is friendly, location is convenient with access to highway and many restaurants. There is a Greek restaurant on site with awesome garlic fries.< /text>

<text>I had a offal time here. The office staff said I could stay til 12.30 and the next morning the housekeeper was at the door at 10:55 telling me I had to get out. Then I went to the office and and the staff was aruging with me that I had to leave. My reservation was for 3pm til 12pm when I booked online but when you arrive check out is 11. Don't go here<//text>< gmap_id>

Been staying here for years, originally called the Sundowner (the sign is still up). Very clean rooms, nice linens and towels. Hot breakfast served by the nice looking pool. A great Greek restaurant is next door.</Text>

Ok place.  A little dated and could definitely use some touch ups as far as painting, new bathroom, and Windows wear the screen isn't torn up.  But it's convenient and everything else was good.< /Text>

For the price this is exactly as advertised.  The only downside is the appliances are a little old and there was no vent in my bathroom.  (I think) as a result of no vent being in the bathroom the cleaning service opened the bathroom window every day to air out the cleaner fumes.  I compulsively had to close it every night, since I don't like sleeping with windows open.</Review>

Basic good housekeeping missed a few details:
1) pack-n-play "crib" needs the padded piece (was replaced by a single queen flat sheet -- ouch ouch!). Front office staff took me to look for it -- found :-)
2) clean the crib!! Cockroach living in the folds!! Smashed, then checked for others.

Otherwise, 1st floor accessibility room w/ (2) queens is fairly newly renovated w/o carpet (yay!) and nice lighting.

Front office staff are nice people and executed quick check-in.<//Text>

Waited 40 minutes to check In. Could not connect to WiFi. Front desk lady argued with me about It and said all of their computers were working fine ! Said MY COMPUTER was the problem. WRONG ! Manager gave me a customer service number and was able to connect to WiFi by bypassing their DNS server. Very noisy last night. People partying on 2nd floor. Not good !<//review>

Horrible experience at this motel.  The room was dirty and smelly. Had to wait 2 hrs to check in because there were no rooms ready when we arrived.  Horrible, horrible customer service.  He had a bad attitude when he checked us in.  We asked for a rollerbed and they delivered it to the room, when we opened it, there were rat poop on the bed sheet. It was so GROSS!!! We quickly folded it back up and rolled it out of our room.  Then I called the front desk and told them about it, but they didn't say nothing, not even a "we're so sorry".  We were suppose to stay there 2 nights but I couldn't sleep that night because this whole ordeal made me uncomfortable.  So we checked out very early the next morning.  I wish I would've taken a picture of the rat poop and report this slum motel to the health department.  I will never, ever stay at another Days Inn ever again!!!  Don't even let the pictures of this motel online fool you.<//Review>

Had leaky roof. Reported it next morning  they did nothing, left it leaking so the whole  corner of the room was flooded. Asked the receptionist to help fix or move me which she said she couldn't. Offered towels. These people DGAF. On par with Sunnyvale as a whole.< /Text>

<text>Nice and cozy little hall too bad the space was kind of small for the event we got to attend there and the fact that there's only 1 restroom (stall) for women line  to pee was awful with only 1 stall that's why I'm giving it a 3 stars other than that it was ok</text>< name>

I was very satisfied with the hotel. Because It has good rocation and reasonable price for the service. I know if you are not satisfying the hotel. You should prepare more money to stay in Sunnyvale, CA.
Thanx ! Days inn & suites, See you later !</Review>

< review>
I ended up spending the nights of Monday - Thursday at the Days Inn in Sunnyvale.  It was the only thing that was close, still available, and under the hotel cap for my company, so I went for it.  I didn't realize it was a motel (strike 1), I didn't realize it was itty-bitty (strike 2), or that it didn't have wifi (strike 3), so I wasn't terribly happy on first arrival.  That night, I was made less happy by being woken up twice by loud rodent sounds coming from roughly under my bed.  Gross, but fine, I thought, I'll just make sure I eat all my meals out, not leave food anywhere, and not spend much time here until tomorrow night, when I can get my money back.

Except they wouldn't let me leave.  They told me first that I couldn't get a refund for the first night, which I thought was lousy but reasonable.  I had paid them for a night in a room, I guess I didn't specify it needed to be rat-free.  Then they told me that I couldn't get my money back for that night, or any of the other nights I was staying there.  "You can leave any time you like, but you can never check out," I guess.  I was pretty resigned at this point, so I asked if they could at least get me some traps I can set so I can sleep.  They said, and I quote this because it is so memorable, "We had the guy buy extra traps this week, but it looks like we're out."  Every part of that sentence is just wrong.  You cannot run a motel under these circumstances.  But no, resigned Nathan just asks if they can direct me to a hardware store so I can buy my own traps.  I figure I'll expense them!  I get the name of one down the street and she prints out Google Maps directions for me.  I follow the Google Maps directions, arrive at the hardware store: it's closed.

So I gave up and coped with it.  The second night I was there I finally got a glimpse of one of these. It was about the size of a soda can and was running from behind my nightstand to behind my bed.  Ugh.</review>

Free breakfast in the morning, descent breakfast, the breakfast area is next to the pool and is quite nice. The staff quite rudely kicked everyone out of the breakfast area ten minutes before the time was up saying they had to clean the place.

the only problem I had was that we were put in a room next to the laundry room ... the noise from the laundry room wasnt the problem, it was the housekeepers. We were woken up at 630am on a Sat by their laughing and cackling. We were not thrilled.<//Text>

The room was large and in decent shape. The fridge was very noisy, though, and we had to unplug it. The worst part of the stay was the outside noise, however. The front wall has NO soundproofing- we can hear people outside as if they were inside. Sirens and train whistles blew all throughout the night, too.</Text>

Terrible. Room was dirty, found a hair inside folded towel,  and water went from hot to cold the entire four days I stayed there. Thought it was just my room, but the other two people I was staying with said the exact thing.<//Review>

<review>it's as you'd expect. it's a days in. you need strength to turn on the taps, the pool is freezing cold. otherwise it's clean and that's what matters. Clean linnens. there really isn't anything within walking distance though. so heads up</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fb7afd9900935:0xf594ca88743e3d25< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This seems like a good deal for the price compared to other Santa Clara hotels and motels. The check-in experience could have been better, I think the 'new guy' checked me in.  Another guy reminded him to speak politely.  The room was nice and seems clean.  The furniture and flooring were in good shape.

Most of the pillows were too big and fluffy for me. Not as much as I have seen at other places though.  It's a good reminder to bring your own.

I did not test the wi-fi, check out the pool or try the coffee.

The towels were as you find most anywhere - white, scratchy and too small.

Parking seems adequate.

I would return here.

Update: I forgot to mention that to charge your phone on the nightstand you need to pull the furniture away from the wall to get to a plug.  The top plug was so loose my charger prongs wouldn't stay in the socket!< /review>

<review>We got a good deal. Everything you need is in that room. However,  my only complain is the noise. I don't know how old the structure is but the wood can get squeaky and the frig motor is pretty loud so if you're a light sleeper heads up.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808fb7afd9900935:0xf594ca88743e3d25</Gmap_id>< time>

<review>Out-dated and dirty. We watched about 5 different men visit the prostitutes in the room next to us within an hour span. They harassed us about my service dog (made copies of her registration, which is actually illegal). Then put a pending charge of $150 on our card before we even checked out. They told us it would be refunded when my husband went in and talked to them then ended up clearing a $200 charge. When I called regarding that charge they told us it would be refunded and that it takes time to go back into our account. Just spoke with then again a week later and they said there is a note to speak with the manager when he gets in. This place is disgusting and will try to scam every penny out of you.< /review><gmapID>0x808fb7afd9900935:0xf594ca88743e3d25</gmapID><Name>Kaylene Black</Name>< Time>

<Text>We have booked so many rooms through orbitz. The room in this hotel was infested with bed bugs. As the booking was done through orbitz we were told that the room was prepaid and hence we had to send an email to the manager to discuss the situation. The manager never responded to the mails. Its sad that Orbitz lists hotels such as this that have poor customer service and super bad rooms.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

Maintenance came to check the thermostat because there was no power to it, but he knocked, and didn't give us time to get to the door, before he used his key to barge into our room. We had traveled 15 hours the day before, so we were tired. The key chain was in, so he wasn't able to come in the room. We got dressed, telling him "just one minute", and by the time we opened the front door, he was gone. I called the front desk, and they said he had already gone (left the property, seriously, after 2 minutes?) The only thing more frustrating than someone barging into your room is that they aren't even there once you get to the door.<//Text>

Stayed there first time 7/29/16 for a concert, evidently used to be a Sundowner motel but new owners.
Checked in they were nice enough, but they want $100 deposit, for credit cards (??) and make sure you DON'T BRING A DOG they aren't allowed (don't know why, the place is nothing special).
The room was ok, hardwood floors, refrigerator, microwave.
Breakfast was ok, nothing special.
Oh, make sure you get to the breakfast because there's NOTHING else around.
It is convenient for 237 or 101.<//text>

< Review>
We reserved a two room suite weeks in advance of our house being tented. When I went to check-in with my two small children they informed me that they had overbooked, so they would be putting us in a single room with two beds. They were unapologetic and did not seem to see anything wrong with the situation. They also did not offer any discounts to make up for our dissappointment. Since we were essentially living our regular life (husband still going to work, kid still going to preschool, etc), it was very important to be getting naps and regular sleep (not vacation sleep). Needless to say, we did not stay there and were quite angry about the whole situation. I would suggest calling ahead of time to make sure that you are actually getting what you reserved.<//Review>

< Review>
I'm sitting in the room right now, debating if I can make it through the night hiding on top of this bed or if I need to go find another room or even sleep in the car. This is by far the worst hotel I've ever been in.
The front desk lady must have been depressed. Checked my friend into my room and me into his and told us to just not cause any issues in the rooms.
In the room, the lights all have sensors on the switches so the lights keep randomly turning on and off. There are cobwebs in the corners, black stains on the walls and the floor boards in the bathroom have all been torn out (probably due to the water damage under the sink).
The sheets and blankets look clean, but of course I'm too freaked out to look at the mattress under them. So I'm going to sleep on top of the blanket and use the blanket from the other bed next to me to keep me warm (this is again assuming I don't hear bugs crawling and abandon everything and sleep in the car).
So much for Days Inn having any semblance of a reliable brand. Avoid this place like it's the plague.<//Review>

The room was poorly maintained with all of the caulk around fixtures crumbling away etc... The desk staff was unhelpful and just short of disinterested. No room service options, laundry out of order,</Text>

Horrible guest service. I have never seen a hotel worse than this.
I had got a room for my old parent who had come to visit me for the weekend.
They noticed that the water is not coming in the wash basin when I droped them to sleep at 10:00 pm. I brought it to the notice of the front desk person. But she said that she cannot do anything for that.
I asked her to change the room but she even refused to do that saying its so late at night!!!!
Basically I think they run the hotel with just one person after 4 pm, thats fine to reduce the costs but they should have somrone for an emerging problem on call which they dont have or they dont bother to trouble them
The customer service means none for them.< /Review>

This is a motel in the true sense of the word. No luxury.  But my room was clean and the location is very central.  But — this is just an old motel.  If all you need is a clean place to sleep for a few hours then this does the job.</Text>

Lots of parking. Rooms were alright for the price. A little hard to find in the dark, the sign they have was covered by bushes/trees<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The attendant treated me with total indifference. I arrived at the hotel after 20 hours of travel and needed to take a shower to go to the congress. She simply told me that the room was not clean and went back to talking on the phone. Since my reservation began the day before.
Except that the PDP left 50 dollars stuck in the card as voucher. I asked and she said she had released the value.
Today, a month after my stay the value remains stuck as voucher on the card. I can not move at all.

A atendente me tratou com total indiferença. Cheguei no hotel depois de 20 horas de viagem e precisava tomar um banho pra ir ao congresso. Ela simplesmente me disse que o quarto não estava limpo e voltou a falar no telefone. Sendo que minha reserva começava no dia anterior.
Fora que a fdp deixou 50 dolares preso no cartão como voucher. Eu perguntei e ela disse que tinha liberado o valor.
Hoje, um mês depois da minha estadia o valor continua preso como voucher no cartão. Não posso movimentar pra nada.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The hair dryer is from 1940 and worse it does not work, the room smells damp, under the stairs there is a lot of trash cigarette butts. Gross !!

La secadora de pelo es de 1940 y peor no sirve, huele el cuarto a humedad, bajo las escaleras hay mucha basura colillas de cigarros. Que asco !!< /Text>< Name>

Der äußere Anschein eines etwas in die Tage gekommene Motel trügt sehr, da die Zimmer sehr sauber und neu renoviert sind. Das Hotelpersonal ist äusserst aufmerksam und freundlich. Die Ausstattung ist sehr gut und gepflegt. WLAN kostenlos, sehr schnell und leicht zu bedienen.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It's creepy, it's ugly, it's cold, it's lost, it's not very clean, it really makes you want to run. But when the booking is booked, you have to sleep there. But I really do not recommend this place. It is particularly difficult to find a nice hotel in the area, but this one is really to be avoided.

(Original)
C'est glauque, c'est moche, c'est froid, c'est perdu, c'est pas très propre, ça donne vraiment envie de partir en courant. Mais quand la réservation est bookée, il faut bien y dormir. Mais je déconseille vraiment cet endroit. Il est particulièrement difficile de trouver un hôtel sympa dans le coin, mais celui là est vraiment à éviter.< /review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><name>Takahiro Yamada<//name><review>(Translated by Google) The location is close to the entrance of the freeway in Silicon Valley, and it is convenient to visit the vicinity of Silicon Valley. I think that the room is also large and has a refrigerator and is good. The drawback is that housekeeping was late or came too early.

(Original)
立地はシリコンバレーの中でフリーウエイの出入り口からも至近で、シリコンバレー近辺を訪問するには便利です。部屋も広めで、冷蔵庫が付いていて、良いと思います。難点は、ハウスキーピングが遅かったり、早く来すぎたりしたことです。< /review>< Time>

Lots of cool stuff. Met the owner Juniver who was painting a cupboard. Several ladies were walking through. No junk being sold here. Seemed to be nice and great condition. Baskets, dressers, lamps, pieces for decorating, candles and more. Small, but comfy store that is very presentable in the midst of Denair's downtown. Hopefully other store owners will be inspired to improve their storefronts.< /review>

The wings are amazing. The fries with the BBQ pork are also fantastic. Service was great the two times I've been there and the restaurant was very clean.</text>

Food is very fresh and tasty!  Favorite is Krave fries,  Sriracha sauce is just spicy enough and doesn't burn if you're not a fan of hot spicy dishes.   Poke is excellent & Ramen is very tasty & huge, usually takes me a few meals to eat it all.   Staff is very friendly,  depending on how busy they are they don't always answer the phone for call in orders but nothing takes a super long time to make so the wait is short.   One of my favorite places to eat!!!<//Text>

The name says it all... once I think about their poke bowls, I really do KRAVE it!  I’m a creature of habit, but love the ahi tuna poke bowl with spicy ponzu. Toppings are always fresh and they pack it in, giving you a very large portion size.< /Review>

Food was good but the customer service was terrible, we called with a pretty simple order and the person on the phone had a problem understanding and was extremely rude. When we picked up the food the cashier who we talked to on the food was rude and mentioned our phone order like she was upset with us.< /Text>

<review>I ordered for the first time over the weekend to go and went inside to pick it up. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. It has a little bar you can build your own salad or rice bowls. I will be trying that next time. We ordered four ramen three shoyu and one miso and there was so much ramen and so many toppings it was amazing. We also ordered gyoza and they were so crunchy and delicious especially when dipped in the sauce. We are definitely going back.</review>< Time>

We have tried almost everything on their menu and nothing ever disappoints it tastes amazingly fresh, they truly care about their customers, and the service they provide. Today was something special as we ordered our food ate in the car before driving home and I ended up going back to get another poke nacho not because their portions are small but because they are that good. They are a small business but truly deserve all the support!!!< /Review>< rate>

Awful customer service. I don't like the guy yelling in such a loud voice. Inconsistent safety precautions- customers dining in a corner, other customers without a mask. I wasn't told how long the wait time would be- oh, wait, the guy did yell 15 minutes from the kitchen. Expensive. Not worth it.< /Review>

David is personable and attentive to creating each masterpiece bowl of Poke... ingredients are fresh and snap with each bite.  Flavorful sauces make each morsel a yummy treat!  Quick stop off the street east of Lowe’s near Tucoemas  Credit Union.< /Text>

<review>I have been here a few times and love the new place. Great food that is kept fresh. Avocado is kept and cut in the kitchen. The staff is very helpful and nice.
Only downside, I can't take any of the alcohol home to try.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

This place rocks, poke at its best. You tell them how to make it. So many choices, all the fixins
The staff is super friendly, and the owner is really genuine guy. outside seating is available. One of the cleanest places in town.

The food and atmosphere are sooo good, I can't wait to dine in when the pandemic ends. We had the poke, miso ramen and wings. All were amazing! By far the best ramen that I've had in Tulare county, it reminds me of the ramen I usually get in Los Angeles. So glad to have a closer option to satisfy my craving! I'll definitely be back to try the shoyu and spicy ramen. Prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes.<//Review>

I ordered spicy shrimp and tofu ramen. Very hearty and flavorful. Excellent quality served hot and fresh. Friendly and courteous staff. The Krave fries are the best fries I’ve ever had. Tender chopped bbq pork over a bed of crispy flavorful fries. The saracha aoli sauce compliments the fries. Will be returning soon for another great meal.</Text>

<text>Afters is super amazing. I love how they can get the donut to be as hot as it is while still having the ice cream be really really cold inside. I always think that I'll be breaking my teeth while eating these milky buns but it turns out okay each time.

My favorite flavor is hands down, the cookie butter. Very similar to my overall favorite flavor, salted caramel, the cookie butter is sweet and savory. It goes really well with the milky bun which is also sweet. Their cookie monster flavor is also really good.

I've never been disappointed with this place. I think the milky buns are a much better version of what everyone's trying to do with ice cream fusions, like with cookies. They have so many flavors and they're patient with you trying the ones you find hitting your curiosity.

The staff is always quite friendly making Afters on the higher end of ice cream parlors out there. I always recommend this place to all my friends and you should definitely check it out.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-V_DEwNq2Hv6wnq0febHqsDixSWZIzCfy4nWd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObCP_kLKA8L9pK-ocKy3rg886tjG8s9_N9SR3S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6V8fhSn8ihGmw02gCIXOsgVh4F8_j8aRyxvj9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPaTDm_3Nxm-YuxyuGjPxCIx_kAlSXeMonQPHI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNouLs8_w3rgVl_iIvUgku1-qMvJot38qGJ2DdJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjmOWWZFiX1lD-TgKWGX2vqUi_BNWpBsxOwzn6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN-Dpfjn0pjc6F9FKeqM1FcTBgT4RkzKGkP4iE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkTMW-0fcrNcFeWZnKUIWXSuQqjkBDVZcty7cx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_cFntQH3vbOCT9AYROMuzt-D544LI8yLMX9mO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc70KaSFbbiQzmOgTpJOr7xauXtXWgbV7x9Zb9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn68uofTLZMLplCcPJvwXlGhQXQjAjIZUF3tIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNr5FfhwCxhoI4ms3kWkEseerjm_-ghmjKRNboN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBORHPxZex3d10ieImLMJcDCiiSIwcf23lWGM8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbgsWc0t_fuuTr--G63HTjlM8Iqq5Fq8u1kVE7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbffgz0-YtKISHHFzVfwTvyr7clBuwmp1_vEBv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><name>Eleanor Ramsey<//name>< UserId.>

<review>Tried this for the first time and WOW! Hot donut with cold ice cream inside... what a combo!

I got

Cookie Monster Milky Bun
Jasmine Milk Tea Milky Bun with Afters Flakes
Açaí blueberry
mint Cookie Monster

All were amazing but the Jasmine Milk tea was my favorite! I was surprised by how they nailed the tea flavor and the Afters Flakes (caramelized corn flakes) provided a nice CRONCH

Caution: the Cookie Monster and mint Cookie Monster has strong food dye so your tongue will get colorful

Q: Where do you learn to make complicated ice cream dishes?⁣
A: Sundae School 😂 ⁣
•⁣
🍨 hey foodie fam, have you heard there are new plant-based ice cream flavors at Afters? They recently partnered up with Eclipse Foods to bring you Chocolate Chip Cookie & Java Chip, made from a blend of oat, corn and potato and taste just as creamy as regular ice cream 🍦. Don’t believe me? Get a double scoop with another flavor and I bet you can’t tell the difference. So delicious 🤤 ⁣
•⁣
What we recommend:
📸 Chocolate Chip + Cookie Monster⁣
📸 Java Chip + Açaí Berry⁣< /text>< pics>

Double scoops is more worth than 1 scoop. Aside from their Rick and Morty ice cream, nothing seemed too interesting.. Their ice cream shop title is also incredibly misleading--it's just called, "Ice Cream"... It's easy to miss when you just enter from the road.</text>< user>

Afters is my goto for the end of a nice date. Can't go wrong with some cereal milk with Afters flakes and Vietnamese coffee. Nothing fancy like some LA ice cream shops but for the same price you get like 3x the ice cream and it's damn good!<//review>

For other Afters virgins: you can either get regular ice cream (cup/cone) or you can get an ice cream sandwich with one of their signature donuts instead of cookies. What more could you need? The staff was also super friendly and helpful for our first time there. Will definitely be going back.< /Text>

Omg!  Ice cream inside a doughnut!  This place is so good we went 2 days in a row.  Got the chocolate doughnut with coffee ice cream.  Coffee ice cream is rich coffee flavor, the Milky Bun tasted like a mocha.  Round 2 got a glazed doughnut with churro ice cream and cinnamon toast crunch topping; omg, it was like eating an ice cream churro.  Both were amazing, could decide which was better.
If you have a sweet tooth,this place a Must GO TO!<//Review>

I love different types of ice cream but this was a huge fail. Overpriced, average (at best) ice cream, not creamy or upscale at all. Huge fail. Spent $7 to try the sticky bun, horribly stale. Don’t waste your money.</Text>

The ice cream here is amazing, very creamy and very flavorful.  My favorite is the Cookie Monster flavor by far but I have tried most of the others and they were really good as well.  Also the price is right, you get really big scoops for the price.  Service has always been great as well, fast and professional.  This is totally my go to ice cream shop in the area.</Text>

We've been going to Afters for 4 years and their scoops are failing at their very best. Their size of their scoops used to be the size of a softball and  now their scoops are almost as big as a size of a tennisball. Also, the icecream is soft and runny.< /Review>

<Review>This is an ice cream and donut lover's dream. It's ice cream sandwiched in between a donut. Depending on time of day, you could have a crazy line or no line at all. Still worth the wait for that sugar rush! Donut comes warm and you get toppings too if you like. Or if you are not feeling the donut, just get ice cream in a cup... But why?<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

The space is kind of oddly sized inside and no seating but there are tables outside. Somehow the girls who work here are always made up to the nines which I sort of worry the false eyelashes might fall in my ice cream but again I commend the effort.
I always get cookie butter in a cup, no toppings, because the flavor shines on its own. Today I also tried the lavender milk tea and that was quite good. The lavender really showed up to the party without smelling like soap. But my heart still belongs to cookie butter.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The location is easy to miss since the signage is minimal, but trust me, you don't want to miss it. There are some really interesting ice cream concoctions like the blue cookie monster flavor with cookie pieces in it (their most popular flavor) or the peanut butter s'mores flavor, which I tried. I had my ice cream in a glazed milky bun, which tasted essentially like having my ice cream in a warm glazed doughnut. The soft, warm, sweet bun surrounded cold, creamy ice cream with crunchy pretzel pieces in it. SO GOOD! The store is pretty plain and doesn't have much ambiance, but if you're looking for a unique treat, this is the place to go.<//Review>

A little too sweet for me if you have the ice cream squished into a donut. They charge to cut that donut in half. What's that about? They have a couple of decent flavors. My advice, skip this place and head over to Cauldron.</Review>

Great flavor choices and fair prices. The ice cream was delicious. They have comes or cups, offer 1, 2, or 3 scoops, and allow you to have two flavors split between each scoop.< /Review>

This place should be called diabetes burger.i only gave 3 stars because I can only handle going here once a year.  The ice cream in a sugar donut actually makes your heart stop, I have to hit my chest a couple of times just to make sure it's still pumping. Not the best ice cream in the world but definitely some interesting combinations. If you are trying to become the fattest person in the world then for you I give this place 5 stars, but for everyone else "try it then diet"< /Text>

I've stood in line at night (since a friend insisted) and I've been able to waltz in with a few minutes wait in the daytime. I will say their ice cream is definitely, really delicious.

But ONLY their ice cream.

Their Milky Bun is the diabetes inducing treat that gets everyone all crazy but A) it's too sweet B) it's too sweet and C) even the non-glazed donut is too sweet.

It looks adorable though. They mash some ice cream in between 2 flat donuts and  then heat seal it so it's like a hot pocket. But. TOO SWEET.

I love just getting their ice cream in a WAFFLE cone. They make it really fresh here and it's ultra crispy!

Almond Cookie and Monster Mint Chip are what I crave.

Yum yum yum.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>This place is great for dessert! Definitely recommend the milky bun, warm donut-like outside with ice cream and toppings sealed inside. They have many flavors of ice cream and toppings that I believe are rotated, but the Afters Flakes are made in-house and really good, like homemade Corn Flakes. Definitely recommend for after dinner treat, or heck after a doctor's appointment for that matter!</Text>< pics>

<Review>Great flavors of ice cream served in a warm glazed donut. Also comes with a wide array of toppings. I can't eat this every night but I wish I could. Service was prompt and friendly. Watch out for lines as some people can't decide what they want but that's OK too since they let u sample the flavors u'd like to try.</Review>< pics>

<text>I loved their peachy mango and blueberry acai sherbet. Both are light refreshing and very delicious I recommend it. The only down side of this location is that their is limited seating.

I tasted the churro and I will definitely be getting that next. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place.<//text><UserId.>100796901249650260094< /UserId.>< rating>

Tried the very hyped up "milky bun-" a glazed donut with ice cream. Although it is a unique dessert, overall for me it was too much sugar overload.

I went on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was about 25 minutes to get to try the ice cream. The decor is hip, sarcastic, and overall just very hipster.

They have a variety of interesting flavors and mixes: for the milky bun you get to choose a topping and they mix it with the ice cream and put it in a warm donut. The best ice cream I tried was jasmine tea- very refreshing and delicious. I instead got cookie butter with captain crunch because I thought the textures would go well.

$5 for this dessert is a little much for me, I'd rather have a cookie ice cream sandwich for half the price. Because of the price and wait, I think the Milky Bun isn't really worth it.< /Review>

Yummy ice cream with interesting flavors. The Earl gray or Cookie monster are my favorite with cap'n crunch as a topping.

Be warned the donut sandwich is very very delicious but the glazed version is super sweet.  Try the unglazed first!< /Text>

I got it on their “milky bun” and was just not a fan. It’s basically a glazed donut but the whole things ends up to be a soggy floppy mess. The flakes added a nice crunch and are very much necessary. The gentleman helping me looked half asleep. Why is the area where they are assembled in behind frosted glass? Makes it feel unclean. It was just like of an underwhelming experience in all regards.</review></record>

It was good....BUT...I don't understand what the hype is all about...the milky bun was ok...its a really neat idea....but not to die for...and for 4$ a scoop for ice cream that's kinda pricey. HOWEVER they do have unique flavors. Like peanut butter s'mores and cookie monster. This particular location was clean and had outside patio seating. Service was friendly. It's a every once in a while kinda place for us.</Review>

I was expecting a big crowd, but was pleasantly surprised to be the only customer there at the moment. Got a milky bun with Almond Cookie ice cream. I really wanted the Peanut Butter S'mores but they didn't have any. It was okay. Very messy, though. I thought $6 was a little high for the amount you got.<//text>

I found out about this place on Instagram! A friend of mine made me drool on my phone after she waited hours in line for a milky bun and posted pictures.

Lucky for me I was traveling back to Cali anyway and had to add this on my list to try!  A local in town said to come early to beat the crowd, yes sir.

The biz sign is on the window made difficult to find unless you have really good eyes ha it just says ice cream in small letters on building, but let me save you the trouble it's sandwiched between a Chinese restaurant chain(forgot name!) and Hallmark in the left corner of the plaza.

They have a list of original ice cream names you won't find anywhere that I can think of,  had trouble deciding, wanted to try them all, ended up with my favorites and I knew I can't go wrong with the flavors. Fun and cool toppings to add.

Glazed Milky Bun + Salted Caramel + Cookie Butter + a sprinkle of lucky charms= sweet warm buttery orgasmic milky bang goodness!!!!

Then you feel like going for a walk after that, but totally worth getting fat for! :)

I'm coming back to try the churro and Vietnamese coffee ice cream!!!< /review>

<Text>The Hype: The glazed milky bun, which is a donut.

The Yum: Their ice cream quality is top notch. I really love their creative flavors such as the cookie monster, churro ice cream, viet coffee, etc.

Jasmine Milk Tea ice cream: I do recommend it. It's not too sugary and it's not super rich.

The Line: It wasn't that long and it gave me time to read some yelp reviews to see what to get.

Tips:
If you still want the milky bun with ice cream then get it without the glaze. The glaze will stick to the paper wrap and the sugar will take over the ice cream flavor. My head hurts from the sugar high I got from it.

If you want the milky bun sealed or filled, they will warm up the bun so your ice cream will melt faster.

Best to get just the ice cream... unless this is your first time here then it doesn't hurt to get the bun so you can cross it off your foodie-list.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd27390c3fe7ab:0x98c5e2648edf90f4<//GmapID></record>

Now that the hype has died down, this place is even better because you don't need to wait in a giant line anymore. There are a good number of very solid flavors that will appeal to most people.</review>

<review>Came to Fountain Valley specifically to try Afters. Unfortunately, I found it to just be hype =(

Luckily, there wasn't a line at all. I decided to get the jasmine milk tea ice cream in a glazed bun, topped with mochi.  While the idea sounds delicious, I found the bun to be a bit dry.  I shared it with the bf, and we both thought it was OK, but not worth the hype.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dd27390c3fe7ab:0x98c5e2648edf90f4< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Really good ice cream with pretty good waffle cones.  The cookie butter is my favorite with chunks of cookies (I think ginger snaps) mixed in.</review>

<Text>Mmm, came here on a sprinkling night but the ice cream still hit the spot. The line can be long every once in a while.. everyone's trying to get that donut bun with ice cream + a topping.

Try a flavor of ice cream before you get it! Several toppings and flavors, not bad at all. Will have to come back to try some other flavors!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd27390c3fe7ab:0x98c5e2648edf90f4</gmapID></record>

I remember when this used to be the place to go , but the staff working there seemed uninterested today , the donut wasn't as warm as I remember , and the cookie crisp was so stale . I brought my girlfriend here for the first time thinking it was going to be just like the first time I came but this place seems like its losing its touch  :(</text>

< Review>
Went for the very first time yesterday and O-M-G, they're doing ice cream right! I got a nostalgia flavor of pineapple & cherry (growing up with Big Stix) and my partner got a mint monster with fruity pebbles in a milky bun. I honestly thought the idea of ice cream in a doughnut sounded way too sweet for my taste but it was just the right amount of creamy and the crunchiness from the Fruity Pebbles was the perfect touch! There was quite a line when we got there but it went by so quickly, we were in and out in 5 minutes! Great job AFTERS :)< /Review>

<review>Didn't like it. Two different scoops of ice cream for my husband, flavor ok but consistency too soft and slightly grainy. I tried the bun. Didnt taste fresh like a regular Krispy Kreme & the ice cream inside was a goopy mess. Couldn't finish. Even if it was a bargain (it's not, at $4 for one scoop & $6 for a bun) we would not return. Stars are for the staff, who deserve a higher rating.</review>< user_name>

Came here one Sunday afternoon and was surprised to find a line outside of the shop! I debated not waiting but figured why not? In the 45 min line, my sister, parents and myself all decided that we wanted to try the glazed milky bun ($5) with different ice creams.

For $5, you can get the bun (glazed or non-glazed) with ice cream in the middle and one topping. They had a pretty good variety of flavors and toppings to choose from.

I personally had the churro bun with oreo bits but also sampled the below:

-cookie monster
-strawberry
-cookie butter

All of them were really really delicious. It was hard to distinguish the exact quality of the ice cream because it was overwhelmed by the taste of the glazed donut. That being said - the overall combo was sweet, messy goodness and I did enjoy the churro flavor.

Not sure if I would wait in that line again but I'd definitely come back again if I'm in the area.<//text>

<Text>Wow! Does Afters live up to the hype? Man I want to find something bad to say about this place but I just can't.  This is one of the few times that the hype actually panned out. Most of the time hype is just a bunch of people following each other for no reason. Afters is worth it! Waiting in line for an hour is not for me. I have only waited 10 or 15 minutes each time. Any more than that and I will pass. For anyone that hates waiting, don't be "that guy" who holds up the line by trying 10 samples. Yes you know who you are you and your cheap friends. I say 1 to 3 samples is fair game but think about what you want while you are in line instead of just pretend you are there for the first time and there isn't a line of impatient people behind you.

It's all about the ice cream. I have only been here a few times but I think the ice cream alone is worth it. I highly recommend getting the ice cream within a milky bun. I always go without toppings because I can go without the sugar adding to more sugar. Besides as my friend always says it's bikini season. I don't personally wear a bikini but I support those who do. I put Afters on my list of things I will make an exception for not eating healthy. I will always have some room for ice cream. Just eat healthy and exercise when you are not enjoying ice cream. My go to is the Jasmine Milk tea ice cream with a milky bun unglazed. I don't have a big sweet tooth and the glaze blast me into another dimension of sugar overload. It was too much for me too handle. I can't hang with people that get multiple scoops or toppings.

I will not tell you this place is amazing because I don't believe or support hype. If you like ice cream and line is decent, you should try Afters at least once. If you don't like Afters I'm glad too because the line will be shorter so keep hating. I want some ice cream now. I still gotta try Sprinkles ice cream because I heard that is the king right now. When I do I will do a comparison with Afters. No party is complete without doing something Afters!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>DONUT + ICE CREAM = $$$$

Throughout the years I'm constantly seeing new and hyped up creations from the ramen burger to the cronut. I mean the idea is great and all but I think these things are seriously overhyped and unfortunately the same goes for the Milky Buns at Afters.

When I heard the line for Afters averages 45mins -1 hr long I knew it probably wouldn't be worth the wait. I had friends tell me about this place and show me pictures of the famous Milky Buns so being a foodie i knew i had to try it for myself. Luckily, this past weekend Jen H. and I dropped by after the Color Run around 2pm on Saturday and to our surprise there was no line! We waited about 5 minutes! So if you want to try this place I highly suggest coming here in the afternoon to avoid the crazy teens that gather here at night.

In terms of the dessert itself, I thought the handmade ice cream was delicious. I sampled a couple flavors and fell in love with the Acai blueberry because I love fruity flavors. The Milky Bun comes with one topping for around $5. I got fruity pebbles and it gave the Milky Bun ice cream sandwich a nice crunch and paired very well with the ice cream. As a whole, the Milky Bun tasted just like a donut ice cream sandwich. Imagine if you were to add really good ice cream inside a glazed donut then you would get the Milky Bun. There really isn't much to it then that so hype or no hype if you must try come during the off hours because the wait is ridiculous if you come at night.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

One of my favorite ice cream places!! I'm glad there was no line this time around. We waited around 30 mins the first time I came to this location. Granted, it was a year or so ago haha.

What I Ordered
- Cookie Monster and Churro Ice Cream

Yummm! Cookie Monster will always be my go to choice!  Jasmine Milk Tea is my second! . However, I had to go for Churro today after sampling it. Delicioussss!!!

Not a fan of the milky bun option. I got that the first time and ended up eating only the ice cream and throwing away the donut. The bun did nothing to enhance the ice cream experience. I wished it was a krispy kreme glazed donut instead. It wasn't sweet enough for me. :X<//review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><name>Walter Macalma</name><Resp>None</Resp><text>Disclaimer: In depth review lies ahead.

Long has the tradition been the dessert come post meal, but years ago I met a man who was so in love with his dessert that he ate it first, knowing that if he were to get full and unable to finish his meal the 1 thing he wasn't going to miss was dessert so he would also often skip appetizers. It's on that premise that I think the name After's plays on, because I think the same effect would occur if they called it "And then".

Todays social media has changed the game in how we market. Beyond the website it's FB, IG, Vine and Twitter that are making the biggest strides. I actually think that the website is a little light on the features.  it's nice and all, fancy and bright, but not really intuitive or informative, just heavy on the pictures, links and promotion. I found out about Afters through IG and not Yelp or friends, that's a first since I'm obviously pretty active yelp hunter.

The signage is really just remnants and a little sketchy compared to the work they put in online. The seating is not tended to or cleaned as often as they are pushing out product. The parking lot is littered, literally with wrappers, melted ice cream and just junk. It looks like a parking lot after a sporting event. They need WAY more trash cans, more tables would be nice too, but not necessary. I don't mind coming here and eating here, but this isn't Starbucks where you set up your laptop and do HW, it's busy, it's packed and hanging around is wasting space when you see how many people want this stuff. Décor inside is stark and basic, 2 toned paint and I get the current Gucci mane reference, but it's kind of permanent for someone who has an expiration date on relevance. Maybe put that 1 in chalk or on a monitor versus paint. Wait can be up to an hour.

I LOVE the monthly changing menu. Check the website with progressive flavors like Milk & Cereal (though I never added sugar to my cereal I know some kids growing up who did, I think it's a regional or cultural thing). Smooth, not too rich, unique. Vietnamese Coffee is  bold up front, but doesn't linger and isn't highly caffeinated like the coffee itself.  Churro is a little gritty and is excellent with caramel as I try to go for the dulce de leche end note. Jasmin Milk tea is a good replica of the typical milk tea you get from boba spots, but since it's ice cream it's quite a bit thicker. Almond cookie is liquid macaroons and great when you get it alone, no toppings. Cookie Monster to me was a bit of a bust. Their rocky road could use more nuts and marshmallows.

It would be nice to have fresh pressed waffle cones and standard made upon ordering. Many of their flavors are so rich you almost need something to mellow them out or go no toppings and in a cup, not cone. NOW onto the star of the show the Milky Bun which is basically a donut, sliced in half, stuffed with your choice of ice cream and toppings and resealed. There are large variences in workmanship as I've had picturesque and then abominations made. The glazed even when eaten right away is messy so go plain and no toppings is my preference. You really can't eat just one, so why wait in line all that time to realize it. Buy 2 and don't be disappointed.

I like the concept, and the ice cream, marketing is on point, but using an old Mexican food shop in a shopping center that probably couldn't handle you popularity or need for immediate expansion lacked some foresight. Oh the curse of innovation. It's a great place to come eat after you get  G Burger across the parking lot. Warning: I've seen 2 people be distracted and hit pedestrians here. Parking lot is dangerous so don't' be distracted walking or driving. My guess is you'll see flavored buns here soon. May your ice cream be high and fat and your buns always be milky.< /text><Rate>4</Rate>< gmapID>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I may never have found out about this place if not for my good friends at Bobalife, (if you love all things boba/cutesy/Asian, I suggest you look them up), and when you have an endorsement by 2 people who clearly know their sweets, you bet I'm going to drive an hour to try these ice cream-stuffed milky buns.

First off, I have to strongly urge you to show up at least 15 minutes before they open, as the lines get hella long, and they stay that way indefinitely. Secondly, these guys have some really unique & delicious ice cream flavors on the menu, so you'll want to bring a friend or two to split a couple of milky buns/ice cream cups. Lastly, bring your appetite; ice cream wedged in between a big glazed donut = sweets overload.

All that being said, who doesn't love the idea of an ice cream sandwich made with a gorgeous piece of sweetly fried Heaven that is the Milky Bun? It's fairly simply: You decide whether or not you want the ice cream in a milky bun, (and why wouldn't you?). You choose your flavor. You add a topping. You pay. You go outside, and try to find a secluded area where you can stuff your face, as the delicious, messy ice cream runs down your fingers. Repeat, if necessary.
With the smorgasbord of flavors like, Churro, Cookie Butter, Vietnamese Coffee, & Jasmine Milk Tea, and toppings like Cap'n Crunch cereal & chocolate chips, you'll want to use the time spent in line to plan your order to waste as little time as possible. Once you're there, you're a bit pressured to move quickly.
Want my advice? Try the most popular combinations of a glazed milky bun with cookie butter, topped with Cap'n Crunch cereal. Or if you're feeling like some java, go for the Vietnamese Coffee topped with some chocolate chips.

Just don't do what I did, show up alone, and then decide to get two stuffed milky buns and scarf them down at the same time. I'm still recovering from the food coma.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

"So I sing you to sleep, after the lovin." - "After the Lovin", Englebert Humperdinck

I first heard of AFTERS Handcrafted Ice Cream during a segment on the KTLA Morning News, featuring their trademark "Milky Buns" & their variety of unique flavors.  I knew right away that I had to move my hot ass on over there someday, and with plans on having dinner at the nearby Shin Sen Gumi Robata & Yakitori, it was the perfect opportunity to come in & and see what all the fuss was about.

AFTERS is located on Brookhurst & Talbert, in Fountain Valley.  If you're looking for a big AFTERS sign, you're SOL.  Just look for ICE CREAM on the left of the plaza, and you've found it.

The friendly employees will kindly let you sample whatever you like.

Around 6pm on a Monday night, with only a few people in line.  Perfect timing by yours truly.

Donuts aren't really my thing, so I already had in mind to have strictly ice cream.  I refer to donuts as "heart attack food".  One of the most unhealthiest things to eat.  I already imagine a "Milky Bun" to be way too sweet for me, so I can share my own unbiased opinion on the "coup de grace" of any ice cream parlor - the ice cream!

Of all that I tried, my favorites were the churro, milk & cereal, jasmine milk tea & Vietnamese coffee.

Each had the distinct flavor of their namesakes.  I loved the crunch of the Frosted Flakes in the milk & cereal.  All had great creamy texture that good ice cream should have.

Service was good.  The employees didn't hesitate to let me sample whatever I'd like.  There are a few outdoor tables to sit & enjoy your ice cream.  Parking is in private lot.

AFTERS Handcrafted Ice Cream makes high quality ice cream in a unique assortment of fun flavors.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to return for more ice cream, but if I'm in the area, I definitely see myself diving in for another scoop or 4 ;p

Highly recommend!
