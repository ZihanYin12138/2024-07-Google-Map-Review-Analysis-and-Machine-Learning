<Text>Great place to pick up sushi thats already prepared and other food items they have on their menu.  I also enjoyed that they have other authentic goodies in their shop and the owners (I'm assuming) are always so happy and have a smile on their face!  The times that I have been there they always spark up a conversation and are super friendly to answer any questions! The shop is always really clean and organized and sushi is always on point!</Text>< date>

The staff was so friendly and eager to serve! It was a wonderful pick-me-up to be greeted with a smile and excitement after a long day.
I definitely recommend Sushi Hut for anyone looking for a delicious meal and a smile.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxY39xlfNU_mNGFfN3ay_SMpuRgHLxifAPnmYr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcyUKRF9zoUM4UWyCWkSqpFfk0xW7rgOIclN-8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

I ate here just yesterday with my family and the experience was great! The food, along with the customer service, was amazing and the lady at the front was incredibly kind, understanding and energetic. You could definitely feel the positivity in the restaurant.< /text>

The wonton soup is delicious and the poke bowls are fresh and tasty. I'm all for their sushi and snacks as well. The owners are wonderful, they always make you feel "at home". 👌💕<//review>

<review>I was running about 30 minutes late to pick up my order. As i arrived i was welcomed by the woman in the front counter. As i told her my name to receive my order, she noticed that i was late and was quick to check if my food had gotten cold! The food was still pleasantly warmed. I had ordered the bbq buns as well and she resteamed them to make sure they would be nice and warm as well. Great customer service. The food did not disappoint, very tasty and delightful.<//review><user>109443396183297373306</user><Resp>None</Resp><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

Extremely clean, organized and well stocked restaurant. The owner is incredibly kind and attentive. She really went above and beyond during my visit. Being from Oahu I have high expectations when it comes to poke but this place definitely reminded me of home! The customers that came in she already knew them and what they’d order, to me that just shows A+ customer service skills and making strong connections.</review>

First time trying this place and I absolutely loved it!!!! The service is amazing! Very enjoyable vibe! And the food was really good as well! Thought it would be a more restaurant type but it seems more of a lunch kind of place. But still loved it!!</Review>

<Review>Food is fresh in taste and quality. The customer service provided is throughout, great at offering food items haven't yet tried or possibly consider ordering for first time buyers. Wont disappoint if you like seafood or willing to try if you haven't yet. Clean environment for the restuarant and restroom stocked, clean as well.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Came into this shop randomly on a hot day wanting boba and a quick roll of sushi. THEY HAVE THE BEST SPICY MAYO IN TOWN AND THIS IS NOT A LIE. i got a package of sushi from their display and it was DELICIOUS. Their boba was just as amazing!!! I’m not a fan of incredibly sweet things and their boba was perfect!! sweet but not to the point of it being gross and the boba was cooked perfectly!!!! My favorite thing was how welcoming the workers were. They made you feel welcomed and truly are the definition of amazing customer service. 10/10 everything about this place is amazing and I definitely recommend it if you wanna try some cool new snacks or munch on sushi or a poke bowl. It was so good that I had a dream about eating more of their sushi (it’s that good). I was kinda bummed that they didn’t have a tip jar because they really deserved a fat tip. New favorite sushi place :-)< /Text>

Staff are really friendly! Especially since it is a local business! The sushi is great and they also have boba too.

<Text>The place is clean and plenty of seating.  The staff super friendly and helpful. I arrived towards closing time so I didn't get to try the sushi. It seems like it's all pre made and packaged so you just buy what's there. I did however try the salmon poki bowl and I asked for it spicy. I'm going to say i was very impressed! Everything tasted so fresh and I don't know all of the ingredients but all the flavors just mixed well together. I'm definitely going back for another salmon poki bowl and next time I'll get there early to try some of the sushi.</Text>< gmap_id>

Have come many times I've enjoyed their rolls, poke bowls and boba. Their seafood is always fresh you can request brown rice instead of white. Always friendly service!< /review>

I love it here, I'm not a big fan of sushi but some of the ones I have tried I have enjoyed. Their boba is delicious. They could get some more sizes though. The service is great they are so nice. They will defiantly remember you and sometimes your order. Every time I go she knows I want the chocolate boba. 10/10 would recommend.<//Review>

They really care about their customers, not just as people who eat here, but as people who they enjoy seeing every time and that they want to get to know.
The sushi is awesome! They've really mastered what they do, and they also offer delicious poke bowls, ramen, and boba teas.
I will keep coming here for as long as I live in the Monterey County! 💙<//review>< Pictures>

By far the best dentist office ever. Haven't been to a dentist since I was 17 so I was kind of nervous. Other than that the doctor was incredible and so were the staff. Will definitely be returning</text>

<Review>Thank you ladies for being kind, respectful. The ladies were not rude, they listened to my needs and the dentist was welcoming, kind and patient with my boys. God bless you ladies.
Very happy patient.</Review>< pics>

The dentist is great, front desk is so helpful. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because it is always so hard to get in contact with the office through the appointment line and there is no direct line for scheduling/rescheduling appointments.<//Text>

It had been awhile since I’d seen a dentist. This office made me feel very comfortable.  Front staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The back was equally helpful and friendly.  Dr Palmer gave me options. He explained everything and helped me make decision what to do next.   I highly recommend Dr Palmer and this office.</review>

And very informative to what my child had. Also gave me options to what medicines he could take. Explained everything. His name was Dr. Felix Conte. Amazing doctor.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x809054c91350b5c3:0xcf30f2804a04fb1f</gmap_id></record>

At first I have had a total of three appointments with Dr Palmer and at first I didn't you know I said a few comments and I didn't wasn't sure what his comments meant and as my appointments have progressed Dr Palmer is by far the best dentist that I've had I've had a total of four dentists to my life throughout my life Dr Palmer is the most knowledgeable and caring and concerned human being who is a very good dentist excellent<//text>

Staff very friendly it's clean in building. My grandson is only 18months went for 1st check up they made him feel comfortable  Dr Palmer was very good with him. So i only gave 4 stars because i don't know how they work on adults but what i seen them doing on adult looked great. So i recommend them for sure.<//Text>

The one exception was they called my RX's into a completely wrong pharmacy that I had never used. I told the MA Walgreens on Oakdale and Scenic and my precipitations were called into CVS on Oakdale rd.
I had to go back into the office to find out where my prescriptions were.
It would be nice to have a direct extension to the office so I dont have to walk into the office for a simple question. Instead of having to go through the call menu where there is no option to speak to someone at the office I ho to.<//Review>< Rating>

The wait in the front to be called into the room was great 30 mins. 35 minutes for the patient room. Better then other golden valley health centers. The dr was helpful and heard what I wanted to say about my health concerns. I would recommend this place and I hope I can continue coming here.< /text>

I tried calling for an appointment for an annual teeth cleaning. Their phone was busy, took me to voicemail and would not let me leave a message. That was not great. When I went by in person the next day to schedule they said I needed an x-ray exam first and then scheduled me that same time. My wait was about 10 mins. That was very good. Then an appointment a few weeks later. They stay busy. Nice A/C.< /text>

<Time>1550101599320<//Time><rating>4<//rating><Text>Overall, my lastest experience at this clinic was stress free. The front desk didn't acknowledge me for a minute or so. But, within 5 mins of recieving paperwork to fill out I was called to the back. The nurse their had a smile on her face and remembered me and my twins from when I previously visited. She spoke with me about my concerns and needs and was very helpful... When the doctor came in he too engaged in conversation with me about my health. I genuinely felt they cared foe me. This visit was less than an hour long, so that was a plus😊.

Worst place to go to. If you call for a question they argue with you. Worst experience I’ve had. Your like a inmate to them just a number. Had a appointment and still waited 3hrs so what was the whole appointment for? Dr won’t call you back they have the workes call. I hope they shut all the GVHC. They are all the same. Only if could give No stars.<//Review>

<rating>3< /rating><review>This visit was for my teenage son, taken in as emergency walk in, due to a back molar giving him trouble. They took xrays of ONLY that tooth. Found he needs a crown and wisdom tooth pulled. Auto referral out, they do neither of those.
He said the experience was ok. I can't give much of a review on all the things, a parent or anyone would want to know about; because parents are not allowed in the back with their minor children at this place, cleanliness of rooms and workspace? Cleanliness and sterilization practices for medical instruments? Let me ask my 14 yr old...Answer from son: "It's alright".
Did they pay attention to you and treat you with respect and politeness? Answer from son: "I guess, Mom"..
Front desk, where I was to bring the papers right back up to a particular young woman.
(Front end) experience with the MA was disappointing, the young lady helping me must have been under alot of stress outside of work because when she snapped at me verbally, as she was receiving the clipboard and patient forms from me; while I was in mid sentence asking for two appts..she complained in rant fashion "I have so, much, going on!"while grabbing the sides of her computer screen! And I was told to Go sit down and wait. O.K. I was, considering 2 appointments...<//review>< Pics>

I really wanted to give 0 ratings but unfortunately theres no option. I had a Very bad experience here. First of all you cant even reach the direct office to speak directly to front desk associates. I had to get transfered to multiple people just to get hold of one person. Than they hang up on you. Front desk associates i guess they dont even know what they doing or maybe they dont want to do their job. Now my daughter will start her school late just because they couldn't give them the information they need. I have filled all the requirements form front desk needed from me before I left the office and its been a month now they still haven't faxed the information.</review>

Went in to their dental office with a toothache. They did x rays and found I need work but dentists is on vacation so guess I get to live with the pain for over a month until they can get me in. Ridiculous! Not Compassionate! Seems like they don't care about patients just trying to make their numbers for the day.< /Review>

Didn't wait to long in the waiting room. Consultation wasn't long. Some times the wait is long but it depends on the Doctors.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Well, I just happened to give my opinion and say that I do recommend this dentist clinic since I made an appointment yesterday and on that same day they treated me super kind and they explain well the things that they are going to do or check apart from all that I like to go wherever I feel comfortable since I don't speak English and of course here in Golden Valley they always have most of the people who speak Spanish, so this will definitely be my clinic !!!

(Original)
Bueno solo paso para dar mi opinión y decir que si recomiendo esta clínica de dentistas ya que yo ayer mismo hice una cita y en ese mismo día me atendieron súper amables y te explican bien las cosas que te van a hacer o checar aparte de todo eso me gusta ir donde me sienta cómoda ya que yo no se hablar inglés y por supuesto aquí en golden valley siempre tienen a la mayoría de la gente que habla español , así que si definitivamente esta será mi clínica !!!< /review>

Best experience. I got quotes and gentlemen gave me 3 options a couple months ago. I had  held off but when I called the back and sent a text I received a prompt responce. Capital & Co Insurance has made the process easy and painless. Great agent and by far the best one with excellent communication and professional. Didn’t give me a run around unlike other agents and gave me the best options and rates. Definitely recommend them to anyone looking for the best deals and great customer service.< /Text>

I wanted to change insurance companies for a better deal and I spoke with Ben, from Capital and Co Insurance,  he was great.  He was very patient, answered all my questions and helped me understand the jargon making me feel very comfortable and satisfied with his customer service. He helped me find the best price possible.  The whole process was easy and professional.  I would recommend this company to anyone who’s looking for any type of Insurance and specifically Ben!!!!! Thank you so much!<//text>

You don't wait on hold forever to talk to someone. Also, they do a good job finding the best price and value in your policy.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Ben helped me out a lot. I had a DUI and couldn’t afford auto insurance. I had shopped around with six other companies and none of them were able to find a policy that I could afford. I called Capital Insurance and wasn’t expecting much. Ben turned my day around. He’s relatable and personable and made me laugh. He wasn’t just trying to sell me a policy. He took time to make me feel comfortable and answered any question I had. He got me a great price that I wouldn’t have thought possible. Great experience and recommend Capital Insurance 100%.

I've been with Capital Insurance for a few months  now and my experience has been nothing short of amazing. The brokers there form personal relationships with their customers so that they can better assess and assist with their needs. They are easily accessible even after business hours for any questions or concerns you may have.

My particular agent, Eidan  has been helping me throughout my insurance journey. Whether I have questions, want to explore other policies that offer lower rates, need to make a claim, or accidentally forget the exact date that I need to pay my policy renewal each month; he is always there to answer my questions, research different companies for me, and remind me that my payments are due. He's an exceptional Capital agent.

I highly recommend Capital  insurance. They're quick, they care, and they are there to help you through your insurance process -- even if your record isn't spotless.< /text>

Thank you ben for all your help and time explaining what policy and why it would best suit my needs. I am now paying a fraction of the price because of you and am very appreciative and grateful for all your help and time on getting me the perfect policy in place. Great customer service skills I’d definitely recommend him to anyone and everyone that’s getting ripped off by their insurance companies… talk to ben folks you’ll be surprised on what he’s capable of!!!!

P.s the kid deserves 10 stars!!</text>

Doing business with Capital Insurance  was one of the best choices I've taken this year. I use to be part of Allstate that upcharged me after my first 3 months with them. Capital Insurance was able to find me an insurance plan that was affordable and completely honest upfront. I highly recommend choosing Capital Insurance . All the agents are knowledgeable, professional, and sincere! Choose them!</review>

I had the sincere pleasure of working with agent Eidan G. He was very professional and explained everything clearly. By far the Best pricing I found in auto insurance. Never thought after my accident I would be paying under $70 a month!
All email transactions was almost instant!!!
Capital Insurance  is very affordable, their response time is amazing and their agents are actual people, not rude or all business. 10/10!!!!!!!!<//Review>

<Review>I’ve shopped around many times before but as far as quality and service, they are amazing! Eidan was able to find me a policy that provided the same coverage I had before, but for a better price. It’s been hard, especially during these times, so I was very thankful. Love you guys.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I love this place! When waiting for food, it can take a bit longer than you'd like but keep in mind this is food made from scratch. So well worth it! Great, great prices for homemade, comfort food! I've had just about everything on this menu; from pupusas to soups, fish, tacos, etc. I can honestly say I've enjoyed everything! I highly recommend anyone to come eat at Genesis.<//text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

The pupusas are small and thin with very little filling, the beans are watery, the Salvadorian cream is watered down and runny, (you literally need a spoon to eat the beans, lol).  You would expect that these foods are suppose to be the staples and highlights for a Salvadorian restaurant and they are not. The flavors are not bad and do taste authentic, however the textures are gross.  It seems as though they are trying to save money by watering down and skimping on their foods.  Which is why I will no longer eat here...< /text>< Gmap_id>

And the prices are a plus. $6.99 for the breakfast plate which includes refried blended black beans, sour cream, fried plantain, avocado, fresh white soft cheese, scrambled eggs with tomato and onions, includes handmade tortilla or french roll. You got to try this place. My mom had the chicken soup with veggies she loved it. We also purchase tamales for $1. Its just amazing. Cash only place!

Small place, very good pupusas they make once ordered but the horchata doesn't taste like horchata & their "salsa" is basically tomato water. Other than that, this place is really good & affordable.</Review>

(Translated by Google) He had a better expectations. Not taste very good portions very limited and average prices popular. Bread is something delicious. And many traditional Salvadoran food. But it is not the best you can improve a lot but it will time with customers.

(Translated by Google) Very good service some very good food dishes.
The only bad bad thing that they need to improve as soon as possible is the Tanning for the pupusas is very bad for not giving off horrible.
The pupusas are good but the tanning and horrible sauce

<rate>4<//rate><text>Taste is really good. Price is pretty fair for the location.
One gripe i seem to have is consistency. Ive ordered both through delivery services or take out and the serving size of brisket/steak or meat in the Dac Biet Large is hit or miss. I have gotten close to 8 slices of rare before and other times a measly portion.
All in all its a good place to eat</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDBFLLqzg6a3XKwO8-kJK6AzypGNwG63tVVLYG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHaXN4T6qodX5K3xwt3Fu6-uXucHndh2vCWsrJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4ktm71a2gqjxvVbmlcwsZSsRqwWachWEQ__Di=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdbc147a28ba3:0x2a444637f18c3812</Gmap_id></record>

Coworker had ordered the calamari and when it arrived, was literally inedible. It was rubbery and hard. Asked if we could change to something else and the waitress said "no, you already ordered it".  It was unexpected and disappointing.

Its unfortunate because their pho and egg rolls are pretty good.<//text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>Service is quick and prompt... Food comes out quickly. Quality seemed to have dropped since they first opened. Their broth for the pho is not that great and a bit salty--it doesn't have the aromatic beef broth smell & not flavorful--there are many other places in the OC with much better quality and much better prices. I would recommend the filet with rice, but these days it's seems to be soggy and has way too much sauce compared to when they first opened. In addition, their cans of soda is $2.75 each with no refills--a bit over priced, especially when I can get a 12-pack at Ralph's for this price when it is on sale. Finally, this was even a more disappointing visit only to learn that they NO LONGER ACCEPT AMEX.</review>< pictures>

This is our go to pho place. The restaurant is clean and food is good. Things we like: rare steak pho, steak over rice, chicken banh mi, egg rolls, charbroiled pork with vermicelli noodles.

Also, take out is always nicely packed. If we order pho, we'll reheat the soup at home, then pour the simmering soup over the noodles and steak in a large bowl. Don't cook the noodles as you heat the soup, or it will fall apart and turn to mush!< /Text>

The new pho place just opened recently. We came here twice (both dinner time) and liked it very much. The interior is newly remodeled and beautiful. The pho broth is sweet and cinnamon-y than other pho places but I like it. We have tried several other dishes and liked them too. The BBQ meat is a bit on the salty side for my taste, the chicken is white meat so it's on the dry side. The seasoning is good though.   Overall, I enjoy coming here. It's so close to Cowan height so we don't have to drive to other pho places. If you like pho, give it a try.</review>

Ordered the Pho Tai Chin for takeout, and knowing I would be charged extra, I asked for extra meat. A regular sized bowl is 8.95. Arrived to pick up my food and my total came out to 17.95 😕. They charged over three dollars for extra rare steak and extra brisket each. At least let me know over the phone that you'll be charging extra for both and let me know the total so maybe I can change my mind? 🤷🏻‍♀️ And much to my demise, the extra amount I received was pretty dang sad. Me being my passive self, I still tipped and ended up leaving with a $20 bowl of pho. Flavor of the pho was good, but not worth $20, that's for sure. The brisket also tasted not fresh - had an unpleasant beefy flavor. I'd stick with rare steak.</Text>

Although I placed an order for pick up (which was delicious), the staff were very kind. I will definitely come back to try a different dish!<//Review>

<text>Staff are very polite. One entree was forgotten but the staff apologized.

The food was delicious and made up for it. It tastes almost like mom's cooking. Will be back here if I'm rock climbing in the area.</text>< Pics>

Finding a good Pho restaurant in Little Saigon? Easy
Finding a good Pho restaurant anywhere else in OC? Hard

This is probably the best Pho restaurant in Tustin, and if it was in Little Saigon, it would probably get a cult following as well. Decor is very hip and modern. Oversized wood chairs and floor give the space a warm feel and lots of natural light brighten up the place.

The broth is packed with aromatics. The cinnamon & star anise are very pronounced. I feel the brisket could be more tender. They bring your utensils out in this neat little woven basket.

Only down side I've seen here is the slow service, especially during the lunch rush. It took 15 minutes to get our food out to us. That's an eternity when you're talking Vietnamese restaurant terms.

Overall, solid spot for Pho and I believe I'll keep returning.</text>

< Review>
Good food. Reasonable pricing. Slow service. It took about 10 minutes to get served after being seated though the place was half empty. That was after finally getting someone's attention. Food came out about 10 minutes later. No follow up afterwards. Check was brought out eventually and no one came back to pick it up. One had to go up to the counter to get it paid.
Iffy if I would return, though the food once was again was good. Ordered a couple of Pho's. Oh another thing of note; they were playing Christmas music as ambient sound.</Review>

The service ain't bad either, the owner's kids sometimes help service the customers. So having their help, along with the other waiters/waitresses really made service easy to get. The whole place is very clean and the seats are comfortable as well.</Text>

<Review>Went there because I was in the area on a Saturday and of the high star rating. There was no line at 11:00 am. The decor in the restaurant was pleasant. I ordered the lunch special that came with a rice dish of chicken and two deep-fried spring rolls. The rolls were disappointing because they weren’t crunchy and tasted so-so. And the chicken was so-so, too. The only thing that I was impressed was the pillowy jasmine rice.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

The environment of the place is really nice and comforting, i arrived and got seated right away but they did take long to take my order i want to say it was atleast 10min before i had to stare at the waiter and then he came and took my order. I did like that he mentioned the lunch special which was basically what i was ordering so that was nice . The broth its self tasted really bland to me, im not one to add sriracha or the "brown sauce" to my pho and i did to this one and i added quite alot. I got the chicken pho and to me even though the broth itself was boiling hot the chikens texture just seemed thick and dull. The lunch special came with 2 eggrolls and they actually forgot to bring them out to me, i had to remind the waiter that my order also came with eggrolls. I was upset with the eggrolls because they weren't hot they were warm but ive had eggrolls where they are still cooking on the plate. The only reason im not giving it a 1 star is because the pho was hot and it stayed hot till the moment i finished it and it didnt look thick like most pho get when they start to cool down. Would i come back , no i wouldn't . Would i recommend it to people? no, but the place was pretty packed with people but this is my opinon.< /text>

<review>The service was great and the food beautiful and delicious. The restaurant itself is spacious and very well decorated. Not your average strip mall vietnamese restaurant!! There were many booths not too close together and we felt very comfortable, not too close to other patrons.
I got pho and asked if it had msg. They weren't positive but found out after I ordered that the vegetable based broth is free of msg as opposed to the beef based broth. However, thankfully I had a very minor reaction to the msg as opposed to other restaurants. I would will ask to have the beef on the side next time so it doesn't cook too much before I eat it.<//review><user_name>Julia Cassen<//user_name>< pics>

First time here and was kinda stunned about how little busines at the time frame I arrived because the atmosphere was beautiful expected high prices but not at all very reasonable authentic but so delicious so light and hit the spot. I am going to be a regular here. Later on drove by and business picked up around 7pm. Love this place.</Text>

<Text>I’ve been going to Jeff now for almost 6 years. This is the best, Most trustworthy, And affordable mechanic shop I’ve ever taken my vehicle to. In the 6 years I have NEVER had to take one of my vehicles back in for the same issue. He always goes above and beyond my expectations. Finding a good mechanic you can trust and that is affordable is hard to find. No one will touch my vehicles but Jeff and his crew. He has earned my trust and my business for life. Thank you Jeff for your hard work and taking care of my vehicles that I put my wife and kids into.<//Text><Date>1602900741282<//Date>< Gmap_id>

They did a fantastic job for me. Hunted down and tracked  a part from a junkyard to another mechanic to get a tiny part that the manufacturer was gonna charge almost $1000 for. Saved me a ton of money when they could've just told me how much the manufacturer part was and not worried about it.< /text>

Needed A/C work done. They completed the work fast and repaired what others could not. He spent time explaining and showing me what was done and why. I had to travel 30 mIles to get to shop but worth going again if I need any repairs to my vehicles. They are honest and have fair pricing.</Text>

<Text>I 100% recommend this shop. I've had AC issues with my car for over 3 years and have taken it to about 3 different shops. Inevitably, their "fixes" would also last a couple of months and the AC would blow out again. Jeff and Anita were super friendly, and Jeff was able to diagnose the issue and get my AC working again in just a few hours. I'm so happy I came here and wish this had been my first stop!<//Text>< name>

Didn’t know anyone here in Visalia that can recommend a good auto repair shop and I’ve been looking at this place’s reviews in a while. I had to get my CV axles replaced and they did it for an affordable price compared to another shop that I went to.

Pepe, the owner, is really nice and trustworthy guy. I went there even before to get my battery and alternator checked and told me right away what needed to be done, while the other place that I went to basically wanted me to keep my car for a day just to “check it”.

Thank you!</Review>

<Review>I went with Pepe’s based on other reviews in regards to honesty and affordability and they were right.  I don’t post reviews often, but was very impressed.  Not only did they get me in fast, they got the AC repaired quickly and was surprised by how affordable they were.  I spent almost as much last year trying to fix it myself and wasn’t successful.  The cherry on top was I realized when I was leaving that they had aired up my tire, they didn’t have to but their attention to their customer was impressive.</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Picked this shop because of good Google reviews. The reviews were true, I feel like we have found the new home for our cars when they need help. Jeff and Anita could not be kinder or more professional. A hidden gem right on Main Street!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1592417682903<//date>< Resp>

<rating>5</rating><Text>After reading all of the positive reviews online I gave Jeff a call and he DEFINITELY did not disappoint! He diagnosed the issues with my vehicle promptly, provided me with a quote for the work, which was very fair. I just picked up my car and realized that he even replaced my burnt out headlight AND changed my oil.....AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!! 😁
It's such a relief to know that there are still businesses and business owners who have integrity and can provide this level of customer service! Thank you Jeff & Team! You've definitely made a customer for life! ❤<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Made a pretty good sandwich. I’ve grown up in the area and have driven by this and other locations, but I think this is the first time I have eaten here. Glad I stopped by and I will probably stop by again when I’m hungry.</Text>

I found this place at a  local charity event and De Vinci's was there sampling their food.  It was delicious so I went to the store/eatery in Lodi.  I love the location in  downtown Lodi.  The inside is inviting and smells wonderful.  They have a big  variety of pastas, chicken and sandwiches.  They make the VERY BEST homemade focaccia bread I have ever had.  I bought a big slab of it to go.  We had the plate of pasta, salad and bread.  It was fantastic.  I asked if I could have half ravioli and  half tortellini.  They said yes so I had that..  I would rate their homemade pasta with a 10. The homemade sauces are very delicious.  The staff was very friendly.  It was very clean too.  I will for sure go back to try everything on their menu.  I would definitely recommend everyone go to De Vinci's.  Make sure you try the bread!!!   Excelkent food.</Text>

Meat was delicious. They were out of all sandwich bread other than focaccia. Service was fair. There we 3-4 girls working but nobody was on the same page. They were not communicating and it was kind of chaotic. Ravioli with meat sauce was incredible, but they were a touch too soft. Great variety of foods. Might try it again in the future if we're in the area.<//text>

The pasta bar here is great! I had some macaroni salad that was creamy and sweet. They always have good simple salad options, too.<//Text>

Food was lacking flavor, overpriced for the amount they served. I have been a customer for many, many years, and the Lodi location was lacking. Stockton locations are more generous and consistent with prices.< /Text>

When it comes to value and conveniences this place is at the top.  It not only is a great take out option but the recent in-house improvments have made it a great family friendly dine alternatively to pizza or other fast casual restaurants in town.  My family and I go there at least once a week.... That good!!< /text>

The only good thing is the foccacia bread and salad, all the pasta sauce (which I'd all the same for every dish) tastes like nasty cafeteria food. I remember it used to be so good, not anymore!< /text>

<text>Food isn’t great and I live in the neighbor hood they create way too much smoke sometimes you can’t be outside especially if you have asthma or your baby is on a teach or ventilator a lot of kids develop asthma in this area I wonder why. The neighbor hood is full of smoke at times it’s like there is a fire . I don’t care if the food is good or not I care about my children...<//text>< Time>

<Review>I've passed this place close to 3 years always wondering about it. One morning passing it i Could smell the smoking food. Then on i vowed to try it.  Boy i wasnt disappointed.  Love the ribs. Salad was great.  I've Paid more for a salad with maybe a 1/3 of the meat they give here. oh and the bbq sauce is fantastic.

Only warning is the parking.  It's a very small lot.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I like this restaurant! They have first-rate food, their menu is nice, The cook in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are consistently good, the service towards the clients  is very good too. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend it with no hesitation.</review>< rate>

When I pulled up the scent of hickory perfumed the air. If The Sirens call you for BBQ this place is the answer. Don't let the low prices fool you, it's legit barbecue done right. While it's not overly seasoned they have a great rub that will make you order an extra meal to take home. Good sized portions here too.< /review>

< review>
The pulled pork sandwich was soaked with runny coleslaw on top, which I was not aware of at time of ordering. There aren't any pictures of the food. The macaroni n cheese was runny and generic. And the apple cobbler was terrible. It was literally apples with stiff uncooked, oatmeal sprinkles. I threw the entire dinner away after 3 bites. Will not return< /review>

This place is old school and does the job! We enjoyed our ribs and the sides we very good too.

I only give 3 stars because they didn't have pulled pork, my personal favorite, they didn't have a patio either and they were little pricey.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I ordered the chicken and tritip dinner for 4 and asked for rare tritip with mashed potatoes and cole slaw and it came with rolls bbq sauce gravy and au jus. I liked the cole slaw and rolls. The wait time was excellent and the meal was ready in 10 minutes from when I called in the order. The au jus had a good flavor. Gravy was ok. Mashed potatoes were runny and had too much liquid mixed in..not sure what liquid they use but their mashed potatoes are not white and more yellow looking from the liquid I am guessing. The tri tip had a good flavor but was not rare and some parts were dry and over cooked. I like tri tip red not gray and dry which is well done from being over cooked or left under heat lamps. The au jus and bbq sauce helped. Chicken was overcooked and dry. The last time I ordered here I recalled similar on the tri tip and chicken so they need to work on cooking to order. Nobody likes dry chicken. It will be sometime before I order food from here again so hopefully they get it. Maybe you need steamers to put your food in? Heat lamps dry meats out. Good luck.< /text>< Gmap_id>

They raise their prices on tri-tip and there's a sign at the counter saying how much each tri-tip dish will cost now. I ordered one and they jacked on another $10 on top of their posted price period that bummed me out. But I love their food< /text>

<text>Food excellent: Had BBQ pork roll and side - bake beens - very good. Decor very basic and a bit tired and old. Don't let discourage you for eating her. The staff are good, and have worked there for a long time. Low turnover means quality people. Would eat there again</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Always servss excellent food.
Hours can be a bit unpredictable, as they make most of their income as caterers.
Did mention their really tasty BBQ?
Beef ribs are always thick and meaty.
They just installed an answering machine, to let customers know when they are closed for the day.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c29cc9a84cdc9b:0x761e4611654d3c14<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ordered the turkey sandwich. It was absolutely amazing. And the bread was sooo good. I was just disappointed that there was nothing else on the sandwich. No lettuce or tomato or anything. Just meat and bread.</Text>

Rosie's BBQ kitchen is my favorite cheat Day meal. All of their food is absolutely delicious you can't go wrong with any of their ribs or other menu items. Every time I'm not feeling the best I call in order to Rosie's and it's always ready within 15 minutes. If you're looking for great barbecue you don't need to look any farther</Text>

Amazing BBQ . I love all the different dishes they have in the menu.  I recomend the BBQ Ribs in particular, so delicious.   Nice bar, clean floors, great handicap access, safe parking lot .  I enjoyed the Hawaiian Breeze drink; we were helped by our waiter Kristen. The environment is friendly and inviting . Come and have a blast . Cheers Rosie's BBQ</Review>

Good BBQ is hard to find.  The baby back ribs were cooked perfectly and not to sweet or over-saturated with sauce.  The pulled pork sandwich was very good -- good pork, fresh bread.<//text>

<Text>We have been here before and had a great experience. Now, not so much. The employees during lunch have no desire to actually work and make sure the customers orders are being filled and to make sure stuff is stocked.
There were no straws, empty containers for condiments. The ice machine jammed and nothing was done. 2 employees were arguing and one didn’t want to get the fries out of the fryer.
Oh, and I ordered a sandwich which was like half the size I had received before.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

We heard good things about this place, so we decided to give it a try. We actually were waiting outside for the place to open. What seemed to be the manager of the place pulled up and walked right past us without a greeting and actually looked annoyed that we were even there to eat. Strike one. Then we went inside to place our order. The worker did not greet us, didn't even acknowledge our existence as people. Strike two. We got our food, and it was absolutely horrendous. The meat was dry, the beans were hard as if they weren't cooked. The point of having baked beans, is to have baked beans. Key word: baked. As in soft .... So that was strike three. We also heard the owners/managers arguing about something that should have remained private. For us, this place is not worth revisiting. Oh, and did I fail to mention this place has a B rating? 🤢 If the service is poor, you can only imagine that they do not care about the quality or cleanliness of the back kitchen area. We will DEFINITELY not be returning to this dump. I feel ashamed for forking over money for pure disappointment and utter disgust.<//review>

Good food. Very southern. Friendly and quick service. Their catering is good too, just don't expect it to be fancy.

Dining area is barebones with tables and chairs. No ambiance. That's not a dig or anything - Rosie's knows what it is and doesn't pretend.

Good, fast, friendly.<//Text>

First thing you notice is the B in the window.  That's not always terrible in L.A. so I gave it a try because I work in the area and always see firemen and cops eating there on break. So it should be great right? Well....  I walked in after noon. Place was very empty. Walked to the counter no one was up front.  About 2 minutes and someone walks up to me behind the register. No greeting.  Just a - are you ready to order? So I ordered a sandwich combo with a drink and mac n cheese on the side. The guy was super uninterested in taking my order. Made me feel like I was bothering him. The food took a long time to arrive. The sandwich was dry and small. Cut in half so it looked like I ordered 2 sliders. The mac n cheese was served in a little plastic cup. Was oily. Burnt. And absolutely flavorless. Couldn't taste any kind of cheese. It was basically boiled pasta then baked in the oven with some flavorless yellow cheese on top. It was SO oily. When I left I said thank you to the guy upfront and waved goodbye.  He looked at me and said nothing. The fountain drink was good. And the bathroom was clean. For those 2 things they get 2 stars.<//review>

Been going there for years. The service is always great. Friendly staff, delicious and food comes out fast. The tri-tip salad is amazing. The only salad I've eaten that fills me up. I recommend it to all my friends.<//text>

This place not been remodeled for last 50 years, City Inspector will shut them down one day for Cockroach and rat infestation.

Awesome tritip sandwiches. The homemade chips are killer. Hidden spicy BBQ sauce isn't very spicy but I did like it's sweetness. Their tender and flavorful baby back ribs are will worth it.<//text>

Great barbecue, friendly staff and fast service!  Their lunch specials are always a good bang for your buck.   Never a bad meal and always a great experience.   My only drawback is they're not open 24 hours.  Lol<//Review>

Food is awesome. They burger is an insult though. It's just a plane frozen patty on hard bread and this still charge like 8$ for it. Everything else is good.< /review>

<review>This place was so delicious. We had the lunch special with a Caesar salad and it was filling for two people. The ribs were really soft, the sauce was delicious (and I do not like BBQ), the garlic bread was pretty good - seemed super fresh, and the Caesar salad dressing and croutons tasted home made. I'm not sure that they are but just my impressions of the place.
The service is very cut and dry but who cares! They get to the point and get you why you want.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Rosies' BBQ catered my daughters wedding in June 2016 located in Orange, CA. Scott was extremely helpful in choosing a menu for 200 ppl. He answered all questions although when he wasn't available he did return my emails or phone calls promptly. The food arrived on time and was DELICIOUS! Our guests can't stop talking about the potato salad and the meatballs! All of the food was super tasty. No complaints. All praises for Rosie's Catering.< /text>

Man! Talk about good! I am a barbecue snob. I personally think I am the best barbecueist in the world. But this food, in an inauspicious building near Topanga and Chatsworth is hands down the best store bought rib meal you can find. Try the 8.95 lunch. You will be estatic.</text>

<text>Rosie's is an okay bbq spot in the West Valley. The meats are actually pretty good, especially the chicken and tri tip, which they are known for. It is not a particularly great place atmosphere wise. It is rather dark inside and on the outside, painted a drab brownish color that makes it difficult to see if it's open..and it does not stand out from the street. The staff up front is mostly high school /college aged kids..they seem to come and go quite frequently, no doubt the pay isn't higher than minimum. Service is therefore not great..like ordering from a fast food joint. The owner is often around, but don't expect her to say anything /greet customers..she usually is secluded in a cubicle of sorts near the register, eating and reading. Honestly, if it weren't the fact that this about the only bbq place around, I'd stop coming by from time to time..it's too dark, and the service is non existent. Better to take food away.< /text><rating>3<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Always good.  My favorites are baby back ribs, tri tip sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, coleslaw, and fries when they are fresh. (Have gotten fries that were stale or reheated on occasion, which went straight to the trash)  Otherwise, food is good and prices are resonable.<//review>

Kevin is an exceptional realtor and individual.  My husband and I worked with Kevin as first time home buyers.  He consistently made himself available to answer our questions and offered valuable advice throughout the home buying process.  Kevin’s skillset as a realtor goes beyond being knowledgeable; his passion and charisma makes him stand out amongst others in his profession.   What we appreciated most about Kevin was his loyalty to us and how much he exceeded our expectations.  We are very grateful for our experience with Kevin and would recommend him to anyone looking for a realtor in the Sacramento area.<//review>

Not only is Kevin knowledgeable and professional, but he truly puts the best interests of his clients ahead of his own (something that, unfortunately, seems to be less and less common these days). As an industry veteran of nearly 3 decades, I can say with confidence that his clients are in good hands with Kevin.</Text>

Buying a home is one of the biggest decisions in life, and I was able to take it easily, because of his help. He helped me familiarize myself with all the paperwork.

Kevin did an excellent job on the sale of our Woodland home (March 2021).  He was able to secure a better than ask offer with a low contingency quick close.  He did an excellent job in negotiating on our behalf.< /Review>

Kevin not only took on a monstrosity of a task in trying to sell my house but he took on the additional duties that no typical Realtor ever would do! He helped me as a single mother who was relocating from the west coast to the east coast mitigate a lot of my stress by taking care of some pending things that I had no time to take care of. Wether it was coming by to help me move things from one place to another, taking down TVs and mounts, to helping me shred paperwork and dump trash he did it all and more!!!! I couldn’t have asked for a better realtor a better person a better mentor in the world of selling and buying then I got in Kevin. He even impressed on my children the values of being a good person a genuine person with integrity professionalism and kindness. His consideration his technique his tact his expertise cannot be described in your ratings but in the paying it forward of all the good that he does for his clients. Kevin thank you so much I could never be any more grateful for such a wonderful person to have helped me with this chapter in my life! God Bless You and Your Beautiful Family!<//text>

He was patient - especially in these trying times for all of us - as we took our time and wanted to look at homes over several months.

Professional and knowledgeable, he navigated us with confidence to finding the homes that met our needs.

During our search, during negotiations and during the closing process he was always on our side working to make our house purchase as simple and successful as possible. The best part about working with Kevin was that he was always focused on answering our questions, giving us good advice, and putting his special negotiator skills to work, getting us the best possible deal.

We will definitely work with Kevin again and we are highly recommending him to anyone!</Text>< Pictures>

We are so fortunate to have met Kevin Mehta when we did. Kevin helped us to navigate the sale of our first home and the purchase our current home. I would need much more space to explain how awesome Kevin was throughout the entire home selling & buying processes. He's a true professional and a genuinely good person. Kevin has become more than our realtor and more of a friend to our family as a result of his kind, helpful nature. We wish we had another house to buy now, just so we could work with him again :) He makes home buying/selling such an exciting and educational endeavor. One of his many great attributes is that he listens and then asks thought provoking questions which ensure you get what you really want. Thank you for everything you've done for our family and all the support and insight you've continued to provide as we have real estate questions!! You are the best!!</Text>

My daughter referred Kevin to us after having a great experience with him on their home purchase.
At the time we were looking for something around the Sacramento area. We eventually moved our focus to an area where my husband got a job. He provided us with an agent in that area who has worked hard for us. He respectfully worked with our agent to answer questions and offer support as needed and helped in the negotiation process.
He has continued to check in on our progress as we have gotten closer to the close date.
He has been nothing but thoughtful and considerate and came to bat for us when it was important to do so. We do not think we would have gotten the seller’s credits that were given without his exceptional negotiating skills.
Kevin is committed to excellence, is thorough, and knows his business.
I have and will continue to recommend him to meet anyone’s real estate needs.<//text>

What character traits do you want in a realtor? If you value honesty, compassion, and a solid work ethic you should call Kevin Mehta. He is a realtor who values his customers as people worth getting to know. Kevin has the heart of a servant. He puts your needs before his. Kevin continued to help my wife and I find our home long after it ceased to be his account because we began to look outside his area. His expertise, knowledge and experience saved us thousands.Give Kevin a call, you’ll find a blessing.<//Text>

<Review>Kevin sold multiple properties for me, including commercial and residential.  No one better in real estate than Kevin and I’ve worked with many realtors before knowing him.  His work ethic is exceptional and he’s very quick to respond to my questions.  His marketing plan is a huge differentiator from other realtors.

Kevin is an expert negotiator and so happy to have him help me with my real estate needs.  I highly recommend Kevin to help you with the selling or buying of your properties!!!<//Review>< pics>

Kevin is an exceptional and professional realtor who helped me sell my property for maximum value!  Kevin has an awesome marketing plan and set him apart from any other realtor that I worked with.  A huge bonus was how he can negotiate so well.

I will proudly recommend Kevin to anyone looking to buy or sell a home!!!!!</Review>

Kevin did a fantastic job, guiding us all the way through the process of finding our next home.

Good negotiator, knowledgeable and confident, he was on our side all the way, from helping us realize what we want to negotiating good terms for the sale and to the closing and the mountain of paperwork that needs to be navigated through.

Highly recommend Kevin for any and all real estate needs!</Text>

Kevin even got us some information from the county and the city to help with our decision. We were under the impression that buyers dont usually have a lot of negotiating leverage when they are buying a new home but Kevin was able to get us builder credits that were  far more than our expectations. Thanks a lot Kevin!</Text>< pictures>

From start to finish, Kevin’s enthusiasm and commitment to finding us the best fit for our needs was impeccable. He loves what he does which makes the process of “working” with him a breeze. He always went above and beyond and well exceeded all of our expectations. Throughout the process he stayed in contact with us and took the time to educate us on different types of properties based on different scenarios. Any questions that we had were answered promptly and truthfully and if he didn’t know the answer, he would do his research to get us the correct answer. Being that the closing was done out of state he made sure everything was done seamlessly and all we had to do was sign. He genuinely cares for his clients and is always looking out for their best interests; we couldn’t ask for anything more. His industry knowledge, unstoppable drive and superior negotiation skills are on another level! We look forward to working with Kevin in the future and HIGHLY recommend his services to anyone!!!!< /text>

Kevin helped me buy my first home and I will definitely be recommending him to any of my friends who are looking to buy in the future.

I was referred to Kevin via a coworker, and was very happy with the referral. As a first time homebuyer, Kevin was able to answer all of my many, many questions that I had throughout the process of buying my house (seriously, I had a lot of questions).

When we looked at houses, I never felt like he was trying to "sell" me on any house in particular - for me this was so important, since as a big people-pleaser, I can sometimes convince myself that I like something, even if I don't, simply because someone is doing a good job selling me on it.

The house that I purchased was older and Kevin really helped to walk me through the repair request process after the inspection. He worked with me to review my list of repairs and edit it down to a list of must-have items to make sure both the seller and myself felt like we got what we needed to lift the inspection contingency. He did a great job negotiating with the seller so I didn't have to compromise on any of my must have items. After the repairs were complete, he called up each of the contractors to talk to them about the repairs that were done and get their feedback on the house, which is something I wouldn't have thought to do as a first time homebuyer, but something that I appreciated.

Buying my first home was by far, the biggest purchase I've ever made, which made it exciting, but quite stressful. Kevin helped to smooth out the process as well as make me feel comfortable and knowledgeable about the decision I was making, which I am very appreciative of.</Review>

<time>1561140770484< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I cannot begin to explain how grateful my husband and I are for Kevin. We were living in South Carolina and my husband got military orders to Northern California and we were connected to Kevin. At first we were leery since it was a long distance realtor relationship, but it worked out amazingly despite the time difference and communication barriers of never having met. Even with our time difference of three hours Kevin was able to work out schedules for us to Skype him so that he could show us houses. We fell in love with one house in particular and he was able to help us negotiate with the seller to get a reasonable price and a few other perks. But it didn't stop there! Even after negotiations were done Kevin STILL kept going, he is one mean negotiator and got numerous repairs done for the house at the cost of the seller, had us close in 17 days (almost unheard of), and even got us a check written from the closing company because they missed our deadline by three days. He even got the company to let us move in earlier even though we technically hadn't closed with the county yet. As first time home buyers my husband and I were extremely impressed by the professional courtesies bestowed upon us and the finesse that Kevin showed through every step of the way. Even now, a month after closing we are still hearing from Kevin about repair updates and how the house is doing. I would definitely recommend Kevin for anyone selling or buying and we plan to use him in the future! You really knocked it out of the park Kevin!!!<//text>< pictures>

With that said, my expectations were still blown away!  He was very knowledgeable and most importantly, accessible.  Although most of our communication was during typical business hours there were times that things happened over the weekend, sometimes around dawn (when I was away on business trips), and one time even around midnight!  He is very responsive with phone/text/e-mail.  He was extremely knowledgeable and answered all (and I mean **ALL**) of our questions.  Even the questions that might come off as stupid or hypothetical, we felt comfortable the entire time.  Thank you so much for helping us navigate our home sale and our 10 offers!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
What sets Kevin apart from other realtors is that he goes above and beyond to protect and benefit his clients.  If there's a better way to do something and a way to save them money he doesn't stop until every benefit has been passed along to his clients.  I highly recommend him for your real estate needs!!</Review>

<Text>To describe Kevin in one word, I would use "PASSION," he really loves what he does because he sees in each new client an opportunity to make a family happy.

He doesn't look to achieve your expectations but to exceed them!<//Text><name>Andrea Cachua Fruchier< /name><GmapID>0x809b214af61f5aef:0x71c8ca45914064df< /GmapID><userid>104004901068420840393<//userid><time>1580862731480</time><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1580868317742, 'text': 'Andrea, I really appreciate your recommendation and your kind words!'}< /resp>< rate>

<name>J<//name><text>Kevin has gone above and beyond for us. He made sure we were taken care of, negotiated more than what we even expected to get, and walked us newbies through every step of the way. It was the luck of the draw that we connected with him through QuickenLoans, but are very glad we did. He kept us true to what we wanted and found us a beautiful home.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate><Resp>{'time': 1570597113547, 'text': 'Hi Justin, thanks so much for providing an amazing review.

Kevin was great to work with. Problems with the condition of property he had listed were handled professionally and as swift as they could be. Communication was fluid and we were able to work together to find a solution that worked for both his, and my clients.</review>

<review>I had originally gave this location 5 stars but I went today and the guy told me that he couldn’t serve me because there was no cook available which I completely understand however, shouldn’t they have back up or shouldn’t he be trained?

They were really patient with me as I had a somewhat of complex order. The wait time was reasonable and I got my entire order correctly the first time, unlike many other fast food restaurants</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcae4755b9cca5:0x2e8610b401a67676</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I came to pick up my order for my mom and our family. But they said they couldn’t give it to me because I had to have the person who sent the order with me. The guy was so rude and didn’t give us the food he also confirmed that we had another order but it got canceled because the door dasher didn’t deliver it so we decided to order pick up. I work at a fast food restaurant and I always deal with customers, I’m always nice, I could never imagine treating customers like he did. The guy was just so rude from the start. Never coming here again.<//Review>

It makes me feel like such a Karen but like, what can I do when 2 out of the 3 burgers are missing in an order?</Review>< gmapID>

Disappointed. Simply asked for no ketchup on my  Famous Star & there was nothing on my burger. Tasted so bland & dry i didn't even finish it. Also, it tasted like they used kale instead of iceberg lettuce.  Service in 24hr drive-thru was fast & courteous, but maybe a little too fast to mess up a simple order. One bad experience won't change my opinion of Carl's thought. Wish they'd have some other menu options like Hardee's does IE: Mushroom n Swiss burger & roast beef sandwiches</text>

<review>Waited a good 20 minutes to order in the drive thru with two other cars infront of me. One was trying to back out of the drive thru because there was a car at the window who wouldn't leave. Turns out they were closed when online it said it was open 24 hours. Lights were on but no one was home. So I drove to Jack in the crack to get the oreo shake I oh most certainly deserved.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Today I had a horrible experience at the university location in riverside on Sep 6th at 1:30. Ordered was 25$ in burgers & fries. Their was a dark haired girl working that day.and a young male. The women at the window forgot 2 of my burgers, fries were cold, it took more the 15 min for the food to come out. And 8 cars behind us. There was no reason for the poor customer services, poor attitude. Tryed to contact but no luck phone proceeded to just ring.

I ordered a burger, small drink and jalapeno poppers as a side and it was $16. It seemed alot but I was ordering a thick burger so I thought maybe thats why. After getting home the order was wrong. They gave me a regular burger patty anf fries then charged me extra for jalapeno poppers. They charged me for a large too. Also the food was cold... Don't go to this one.<//review>< pictures>

You guys know Carl's jr. It's a famous chain of restaurants that began as a series of subsidiary restaurants to a larger restaurant named Carl's. The spin-off became more successful than the pilot, so to speak, and who the hell now ever heard of Carl's? This place is okay today merely because I find they have no California roast beef sandwiches on the menu anymore. Those sandwiches were absolutely bomb. Especially with ketchup. So come on Carl, Junior us up some California roast beef sandwiches and I'll raise new from 3 stars to 5 on a scale of 1 to 20 encompassing all the restaurants in the world on streets that begin with k. For California, phonetically.< /Text>

Hi I ordered 2 BFC burgers and for both of them they were made very sloppy and looked unappetizing even the sides were very cold and stale, my 2 large drinks bearly had any ice and the sodas were flat. Unfortunate I didn’t take the time to check the food as it was handed to me, and when I got home I noticed these mistakes.< /review>

<Text>Came through with the family to have the Beyond Famous Stars, and although they were a bit disappointing (extremely messy, unseasoned), this is not the reason for my 1 star review. My reason is the shift leader, Adreina. Her behavior towards a disabled, homeless, customer was absolutely disgusting. A man came in, prepared to order, but was told to leave, once she saw him. This man said more than once that he just wanted to order, and pleaded more than once to know what he'd done wrong. She just continued to tell him to leave. The poor man left, humiliated and undoubtedly hungry. Absolutely horrendous. You cannot always look at a person, and know they're homeless. You cannot always assume a homeless person will not have money. Most importantly, how dare you take away such an opportunity, that most take for granted? Knowing you ate today. Not everyone has that luxury. Please, teach your employees compassion. Unacceptable.< /Text>< Time>

BUT I do take my mom here and she enjoys the coffee (she says it's not as bitter as Starbucks) and she prefers the chicken sandwiches. I have had the plain biscuits. They are way too salty, flavorless, and mediocre. The staff is pleasant. If you're a lover of this chain, it may be worth checking out. If you're a real foodie, stay away from this joint.< /Text>< Pictures>

First they need to update their hours. Second they need more vegetarian options. Foods pretty good though.</Review>

Everytime I come here the food is cold. They have the nerve to raise the prices but this location is horrible. I'm always polite and willing to waite, still always get cold food or wrong order.< /text>

Definitely one of the nicer Carl's Jr I've been to. My order took a long time to come out so the cashier gave me a free dessert so I'm not upset. The food is like any other Carl's Jr. The staff does make sure to keep things clean, which is nice.</Text>

I had been craving pasta all week and this restaurant certainly satisfied that craving! I got the rigatoni sausage and was literally scraping the sauce off the plate it was so good. They brought out bruschetta on the house and our waiter was personable and made us feel like family.<//Text>

More for Carl's Jr. Doesn't accept any of the NFC payments, but does deliver your food to you. Wifi is great! Bathrooms require a token. And they have a small salad bar of condiments which is cool!< /Text>

Female manager was in the back messing with trash...when I got her attention she came to the front and started taking my order. She then started making people's orders WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. Then got mad at me when I asked her bout not washing her hands. She did not wash them till I told her I was calling corporate.<//text>

Ok first off  what fast food place close at 10???? And they told me that the Green burrito  is over at 9:30,  like it should be open till you close . The staff it rude and did not try to sale me anything or ask if I wanted anything .she just told me ok have a good day after one question about the Green burrito.  I was completely taken by surprise that she shut me down so quickly. And I seen that they used the dirty mop water to scrub the ground on the outside .< /Text>

<Text>This is strange. I am in california and just walked into this specific carls jr and asked if they would SELL me 3 cups of hot water. The cashier seemed to be ok to do it then what seems like a shift leader or shift manager starts saying something in spanish to her and she tells me she cant GIVE me water. I said i will pay whatever the coffee price is, then the shift manager says its california health department law that they cant sell me hot water.

Is this true??? I have received hot water SOLD to me by Mcdonalds, Buger King, etc while i visited California. I am confused.

If its not true, i will send Carl's Jr an email in reguards to this matter.< /Text>< name>
