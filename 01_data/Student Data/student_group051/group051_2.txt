The food here is exceptionally flavorful and I really appreciate the variety of vegan options. I ordered the curry “chicken” and it was delicious, though I’d note that “spicy” was absolutely covered in red pepper flakes that changed the texture in a bad way. I loved the rice and plantains. Veggies were great too, very flavorful. I wish there were slightly more veggies and less rice. But it was a super tasty meal and I’ll definitely be back.<//Review>

<review>The service was great. However, my mom had the curry goat and coconut rice & peas. Both the curry goat and rice had entirely too much garlic. I could smell the garlic before we even opened the bag.
I ordered BBQ chicken wings with coconut rice & peas. The chicken was good but the rice was not tasty. Too much garlic. I am Jamaican and I have never had garlic in coconut rice from anywhere. I eat coconut rice all the time from Cuban restaurants etc. Never with garlic, not tasty at all. I was excited to try this restaurant but was disappointed. I will stick to authentic Jamaican food from one 876 in Chatsworth.< /review>< rate>

Ordered the Jerk Chicken box. Came with fried plantains and coconut rice and beans. Coleslaw and extra jerk sauce on the side. All were great. I'm no jerk chicken expert but, chicken was was moist and came clean off the bone. Poured extra sauce on chicken and the spiciness was perfect for me. Made my brow glisten a little but, did not kill the flavor. Rice and plantains went well with it. Also ordered the carrot cake great as well. I will definitely be back.<//Review>

Always amazing food, and kind service. I’ve always tried the jerk tofu and plant based chicken. Today i had the pleasure of trying the curry plant based shrimp and plant based curry chicken - both AMAZING!! Will definitely be ordered the shrimp again next time and always look forward to eating from here. 10/10 everyone should try their food!!< /Review>

Honestly, I didn’t even know this Majestic Establishment was near me. If it wasn’t for my brother coming to visit me for Long Beach I probably would have never been able to experience the amazing taste that is JamaFo. When we arrived it was very simple to Oder from the kiosk. I had noticed that they offered Vegan options which at first confused because their vegan options where vegan chicken and shrimp etc.
So I had trusted it was vegan and went the Vegan chicken curry with the coconut rice and steamed vegetables. It was definitely worthy of its price. If I had to compare it I would say it’s like that episode of Rick and Morty (The Shoney’s Ep) when the big agent was eating the nuggets with the Szechuan sauce. If you haven’t seen it you missed the reference,anyway the food is amazing and generously portioned. I came back the next three days and over that time I was able to ask and the find out that their Meats are Vegan I seen the recipe although I can’t recite it.Courtesy of a wonderful employee. Great Food, Great Price, Great Portions. Much love.</review>

<Review>Delicious food, as usual. We typically get the curry chicken and jerk chicken.  This time, we ordered the curry goat and it was extremely spicy, more than we can handle comfortably. We will be sure to request mild next time.< /Review>< pictures>

I'm so glad I found this spot in the valley. Their food has always been great. Very friendly staff. Favorite meal is their oxtail box. Their jerk chicken and curry chicken are also good. Best patties are the beef patties. Haven't tried their drinks. Overall, everything is great.<//Text>

Perfect 10!!! I haven't even finished eating my food before I stopped to give my review.

1. PLENTY of food! Got two to-go dishes and they were absolutely STUFFED with food.

2. Food was GREAT! Peas & Rice = fluffy! Oxtails = savory and tender. Curry shrimp = flavorful! Plantains were even soft.

3. Prices are reasonable! See #1. Because that is the determining factor anyhow.

4. The gentleman was very friendly and helpful over the phone!

5. Online ordering was easy!

I don't live on this side of town, but whenever I'm in the valley again I will be back!<//Text>

<Review>I haven't had Caribbean food in almost 10 years. Found this spot today and OMG the curry goat was SO good. I will definitely be back soon. The rice and peas and steamed veggies hit the spot, too!< /Review><time>1597470746541<//time>< pics>

I was impressed, phone in my order, picked up within 30 minute. Very clean, quite impressed. Met Dave and knew if  the food was nice as the place I would be coming back. I ordered oxtails for my daughter and I, she had rice and beans with hers and I had the vegetable rice. The whole dinner was excellent for my daughter and i.< /Text>

This place is awesome!  I should have tried it sooner.  I kept seeing it come up when I searched for vegan options on food delivery services.  Tonight my wife and I tried it and wish we ordered sooner.  We ordered the jerk tofu box and the coconut curry tofu box and vegetable patties.  Everything was flavorful and delicious.  The portion sizes are huge.  We definitely had leftovers.</Text>

You got the best plantains in town! But I need a lot more meat in the chicken patties. I got a couple good ones but a couple were not much meat at all. Please dont skimp on the meat those patties can be very filling but I cant afford to buy 4 or 5 every time for just one sitting and a side.</text>

<text>I love this place! So glad to find a jamaican place in the Valley, I used to drive to Inglewood for my Caribbean fix. The oxtail is a bit sweeter than I’m used to but it definitely hits the spot, the customer service is excellent, really like the loyalty program, and place always looks clean.</text></record></dataset><record>

Newly opened and very small. I believe that the only do catering and take out due to their size.
It's also hard to find. Parking is horrible. But the people were very nice and the food was excellent. I had the jerk chicken.<//Review>

<Text>Delicious! Nice hearty portions. Got the jerk chicken and it was moist and had the  perfect spiciness with an accompanying sweet sauce, with a huge portion of rice and beans. Additional sides are plantains and I had the Cole slaw. My friend had the shrimp and it was also delicious.  Highly recommend.< /Text>< Name>

One word describes this place-

Flavors!!

Brian prepared my family's dinner meal for us.  It was my first time there after driving by so many times for some many years from work or even from church.  I decided that I wanted to try this place out and I'm glad I did.

The short ribs were very soft and flavorful.  The vegetables were crunchy and tender but not overcooked.  I don't know how Brian did it but everything that he prepared for us and we ate was so flavorful.  All of the flavors were infused and melded together.  I also ordered the braised pork and the non spicy curry cage free chicken.  The most surprising of all was the Fiesta Combo Plate.  It reminded me of chicken sisig, a Filipino dish.  This quickly became the favorite.

I recommend to try this place out.  Their food is prepared fresh with fresh ingredients grown out front such as the herbs they used probably for making these dishes so flavorful and magical.  For sure we're coming back again in the future.</Text>

Great food! They have what I'm guessing is a seasonal 'Taste of Guam' menu on... the chicken was terrific. From the regular menu the ribs were everything you'd want in ribs. Excellent service too.< /text>

It was good...I usually go here to treat myself because it is local and walkable.  This has great quality ingredients and fresh veggies, I think the items are organic and locally grown.  This week I had their gyro and it had some type of lemon cucumber in it along with the fresh greens.  It was sweet and interesting and gave the gyro good texture.  The owner is local and prides himself in his work.  We try to support local businesses so it's great to see this restaurant here!<//Review>

We tried spicy lamb, spicy pork, and curry chicken, they come with more than ten types of vegetables in them combined. What is amazing is that all these vegetables but the onion come from their organic vegetable garden in the East Bay.  We will come back soon to try their grilled stuff soon.</Review>< pictures>

Woah! So good, glad I stopped here! The sign says organic, free range, local and fresh.... So true! It's undeniably fresh, and delicious. Most of their produce is grown nearby at a Buddhist temple. I'm already looking forward to my delivery route next week:)</text>

Me and my date ordered a Chinese type spicy chicken and the Thai Spicy Green Curry Tofu.

Definitely NOT worth its current 4.9 stars. There is nothing Thai about the Thai Sweet Curry Seafood. Average at best. Short ribs were slightly less than average; substantial gristle. Probably wise to stick with the grilled meats.  Service was accommodating. Restaurant was cold. Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.< /review>

I tried their tri-tip steak.  It smelled wonderful.  It was fresh off the grill, tasty, delicious and mouth watering.  It comes with two sides.  I opted for double the organic salad.  The other options are pita, white rice or grilled vegetables.  The service is friendly and helpful.  It is clean and inviting.  I will return to try more of their other entrees.< /text>

I was doing laundry during my business trip after a search for a laundromat near my hotel. I paid way less for a filling and healthy entree with all sorts of vegetable stewed to my spicy pork dish. The place does not charge for steamed rice as most Chinese places do. Visiting from the East Coast, I was getting used to pay New York City price for food after eating several times on Castro Street. This place taught me otherwise. Thank you Yami Grill!</Text><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

I am definitely going back: fresh cooked food, spicy and not so spicy. The best part is the selection of dishes, a little from various cultures. Delicious!!</Text>

I'm surprised at how rude the staff is.  I had questions about the menu and the waiter wasn't interested in answering them.  There's a WiFi YamiGrillCustomer that has apparently been disabled.  I won't come back.

Edit with a reply:  You didn't offer that I could pay for my own food separate from the group.  When I asked if I could order something you told me that I wasn't allowed to order and then WALKED AWAY as I was trying to ask you a question.  I tried to get your attention and barely got a chance to ask you about the WiFi.  I had also wanted to ask about what was in the appetizers at the table which involved interrupting the meeting that was in progress so that our group leader could ask you.

If you'd made any attempt to be polite, I wouldn't have bothered with the rating.  This is entirely about the service.</text>

I found out about this place from a Groupon deal. Prior to this, I never knew that there was a small strip mall in this location. Yami Grill is ok...the menu is expansive...they serve food from different cuisines. I was always skeptical of restaurants like this. But it turns out that the food was not bad. I will go back if I am in the area.</Text>

I do not know where you are from, but in the center of Mountain View, where we pay $15 minimum hourly salary, $13.95 for 8 oz of Tri-tip steak grilled to order per your request of doneness, and a fresh organic salad, Thailand long grain rice, decorated with toasted sesame and Teriyaki sauce;  and $11.95 for two 4 oz pieces of fish fillet thinly battered and fried to order with steak cut fries, house tartar sauce, I agree they are priced cheap, but the quality is not. If you have a restaurant within 10 miles of vincinity of Yami Grill, that serves similar menu items you have ordered but with higher quality, please kindly suggest to us. We will not only visit them and try these dishes out so that we can improve our quality, we will also buy gift certificates for you for that restaurant in the amount you've paid us. Basically, I am willing to give you a full refund for the money you've paid us to show our sincere gratitude. Thank you again, and you must know how to reach us, via www.yamigrill.com."}< /resp>

<Text>Don't do it if you don't have a plan b, Or are far from home. Flixbus may cancel or reschedule your bus after you are already sitting there waiting for more than an hour.  This might be fine if you're just going somewhere nearby where someone can come get you, but not reliable to use as connection from let's just say the amtrak or an airplane. You may become stranded in a foreign city and they will do little about it. You may have to wait many hours maybe overnight before the issue is resolved. Also calling customer service was useless.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I was expecting that in this pandemic they will not fill the whole bus even when I called them and they said they will have social distancing in the bus and it's not full which was not true at all.

In a pretty sketch area with a decent amount of crazies near by. No place to sit while waiting for your bus to arrive and not covered from rain. Guess I can't complain too much about it for their inexpensive fares.<//review>

<review>Booked a ride Downtown Santa Monica to San Diego. The bus didn't show up. There were no info in app. After an hour waiting I've called support. After several calls they've just offered a refund. I really think that public transportation can be good, so this company must just go away</review>< user_name>

<Text>FlixBus left me STRANDED! This was my first time riding on Flixbus. The ride from Vegas to Montclair was about 25 minutes late getting us there but other than that it was fine. But when I tried to get home 2 days later the bus never showed up. There were 7 people waiting at the bus stop. But the bus never showed up. An hour and 15 minutes later I got a hold of someone on the phone with costumer service who said the driver claimed they drove by the stop and no one was there. There were 7 people at that stop, 10 min before it was scheduled to arrive. The bus never drove by. Do not take Flixbus, very unreliable, I'm now stuck in a different state waiting for the next bus to come TOMORROW. My wife has to call in sick to work tomorrow and Flixbus just cost us a days wage.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
TAKE NOTE: THE STOP IS ACTUALLY WEST FROM WHAT IS SHOWN ON THE MAP ITS ON THE LAST SET OF 3 BENCHES WEST OF THE BUS STOP.
HONEST REVIEW PART 1
So far i got picked up from them i got a notification of a 5min delay. The app couldn't track the bus at all whatsoever. (not too worried at the moment after the reviews) 5 more minutes passed no update on a delay. Then it arrives, i get on and my seat i reserved was taken. Still some spots open and jist about it. I do believe maybe that the location of the company on the map is actually about 100 feet west(toward monte vista) of the location. Its at the last set of 3 benches after the 3 benches with the 2 bus stop signs.  Had no problem getting on the driver looked on his phone said my name and i was able to get one with ease. The buses are nice and clean inside, you can bring your own food, and they have restrooms too! (now for the ride back where people got stranded i will follow up tomorrow night from victorville after this) I do think the placement on google maps and how the company explains the stops are very different areas from google maps. Which i think is maybe why people miss it or the bus never shows up. People did mention that theu even had a groip of people waiting. But we shall see</Review>

I received INCREDIBLE service from Love Haight Computers for a LCD display replacement for my late 2013 MacBook Pro 15” retina laptop. I get anxious anytime I have to take my laptop in for a repair, but from the start they made me feel comfortable placing my laptop in their care. I received a prompt response to my service inquiry online and they had a “like new” refurbished LCD display with which to replace my shattered one. I am a full-time graduate student with a very busy work schedule so it’s difficult to go without my laptop for several days. Not only did Love Haight Computers offer me a cheaper repair option with the refurbished LCD display, they replaced my screen within just a few hours! I am so appreciative of the team and all that they did to get my computer working again, and with such a fast turnaround! This refurbished screen works amazingly, so happy that I came to Love Haight Computers. Will continue going there for all my repair needs!</text>

Horrible customer service, completely unorganized and their quotes consist of “how much do you want for it?” — I’m picking all of my items back up and going to someone who knows their stuff and doesn’t just buy Apple products. They should win an award for the amount of my time they wasted.<//Review>

Love Haight Computers and has been a HUGE blessing and lifesaver when I needed it the most. The staff will work with you and do whatever they can to get you into a machine that fits your budget. Being a broke student whose previous MacBook was stolen, the owner helped me find a laptop that fit my budget and saved an entire semester of school. I will ALWAYS be grateful and bring any computer needs and repair issues to Love Haight Computers first. I recommend this shop to all of my colleagues, and if you haven't visited, you should stop by and let them win your business themselves - you won't be disappointed!</Text>

I went in to get my battery on my Mac pro replaced. They weren't sure how long it might take but to come back in an hour. I returned in 45 minutes and they had it done. They even attached new rubber feet to the bottom of my computer for 10 bucks! Awesome service, friendly people, highly recommend.</text>

Azm has taken care of me and my computer woes for the past three years.  I love that Love Haight Computers has a personal, non-corporate vibe.  They are always super fast with their turn around and have reasonable prices.

Things I have had done-  RAM upgrade, hard drive information transfer, screen replacement and battery replacement.

Also, Azm knows that I am an artist and always cleans my dust/paint smother computer!<//text>

review. These guys just rock ! Super accommodating and informative. Still singing their praises!

They are into helping you keep whatever computer you've got running. Brought in a 2010 laptop. Downtown at another computer store their answer was get a new one. Love and Haight fixed my computer and at avery low cost respectively.
Thank You. Will be sending you as much business as possible.<//review><user_id>103057529022502585573< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x808580a6cc645d4d:0x9b8b8dad3cdf4204<//Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Great staff. Very knowledgeable and friendly. A little pricy, but totally worth it. Also they are 95% Mac focused here, meaning they don't really have much in the way of PC/Android. It's mostly a repair shop, not a computer supply or parts store. I feel some reviews and results on Yelp/Google/maps/ask are kind of misleading​ about Love Haight Computers<//review>

PLEASE DON'T EVER GO TO LOVE HAIGHT COMPUTER.
PLEASE GO TO APPLE STORE FIRST BEFORE YOU GO TO THIS PLACE.
First of all, this isn't my first time at this place. I used to trust them, but not anymore.

My MacBook stopped working. Because of having gone here before, I thought I should just go here again because Apple store is official and likely to be "expensive", but turns out, APPLE STORE IS WAY CHEAPER.

LHC diagnosed and told me my laptop is helpless. It will cost $900 to fix or get a "refurbished used" one. Due to how disappointing it is, I decided to go to Apple store and find out what they say. BUT LHC CHARGED ME $200 for diagnostic still.

Apple Store charged nothing for diagnostic or transferring data on this computer. More importantly, they told me they can fix it for LESS THAN $500.

Obviously, I wasted $200 at LHC for nothing. And they were trying to trick me into giving them my fixable computer and taking something that is likely older or worse from them for $900.

NO WAY. PLEASE DON'T EVER GO TO LOVE HAIGHT COMPUTER.<//Review><Date>1544216131146<//Date>< Gmap_id>

Way to quick to throw BIG prices around.. Disappointed bought something i didn't need.. Didn't really see the point of the guy being there as he didn't do or check anything.

Said no to a pricey repair, got home had a look myself for about 1 minute tightened and screw all fixed beautiful. Total time of labour 15 seconds.

Make your own mind up

I'm a cook and no idea about computers.< /Review>

<text>My mac book air had been non-functioning with the "ball of doom" for weeks! I tried to swing by the Apple store and they turned me away, instructing me to make an appointment with the genius bar online.  Lame.  I turned to yelp!  These guys have rave reviews and I see why!  There location is prime, central, but still with tons of parking.  They were so cool, easily diagnosing the problem, trouble shooting for an easy fix and casually telling me my options if I want to upgrade to fix the problem in the long run.  Despite spending a good 30 minutes with me, they didn't charge me a dime.  I will be back with any future IT needs! These guys are great. Thank you!<//text>< pics>

<text>Recieved used computer from there as a gift. Needed several pricey repairs, until they finally agreed to swap my computer out for a comparable one. They smiled the whole time that they gouged me for repairs the second one needed from day one, switched my computer out for the previous lemon with the last repair. Their dog is really cool.</text><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

<Text>Note: The do not work on Windows! I was disappointed when I showed up after calling to confirm if they can assist me to show up to the door to be denied. Despite being bitter, especially after walking 10 blocks with my desktop, they were still very kind and helped refer me to a different repair shop. If I run into mac problems, I'll definitely come back to them.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This place is incredible -- I have tons of love for Love Haight computers. A few months ago I bought the new MacBook Air and later realized I didn't really have any use for it. Worried it wasn't worth my while to take a loss on the sale, I was amazed when Love Haight offered me close to what people are selling their Macs for on Craigslist. Another perk is I didn't have to deal with emailing a bunch of strangers and arranging a sale. I looked at other online services for MacBook Air buybacks and found the offers to be way too low based on what I originally paid. Love Haight offered me way more money and gave me the choice of receiving cash or a check. In addition, I didn't have to deal with shipping my computer, which made the process so much easier.

Prior to my most recent visit my iPhone screen cracked. I took it to Love Haight and they fixed it within 30 minutes for less than it would've cost anywhere else. They're completely worthy of the 5-star review. If I ever have any tech issues, it's pretty clear who my #1 choice is in SF.<//text>

< Review>
My friend referred me and I'm so glad I went! My laptop was stollen :( and I needed an affordable replacement. Going in for a referbished Mac was way easier than scrolling through all the options online. I hate online shopping for big purchases! The guys over at Love Haight are awesome, friendly, knowledgable, trustable, and made computer buying SUPER easy. They found me a machine in my budget and added the extra RAM I needed in just a few minutes. Thanks so much, my computer is the BOMB and I feel secure with the 1 year warranty. Love Haight, you all will be my computer guys for life <3</Review>

The seller was totally ignorant about computers and how to sell, at one point I've asked about the specifications of two computers and he told me that first I have to choose the equipment that i wont and after he tell me the specification T-T (How does he want a choice if I only know the serial number of the product?!?). Bad seller and expensive equipment equal bad shop.< /text>

Worst place to buy Baile tickets, if the events get cancelled they do not give you your money back and make up a lot of excuses! For example they blame it on the ones pronouncing the events yet they’re the ones selling the tickets ,which makes them responsible to return the money. They also tried telling me to go to other stores saying they will give the my refund, and as soon as I go to the other store I am told that “it is not their responsibility because they didn’t sale those tickets to me “ which I strongly agree! Why would another store give me the refund if they didn’t sale them to me. Really disappointed on how this works . I highly recommend not buying any tickets unless you’re sure the events won’t get cancelled, and if it does good luck getting your money back.<//text>

I was in Woodland last week & stopped by La Superior for the 1st time & was pleasantly surprised.  They have a great selection of meats & cheese (and lots of other items).  I was commenting about the great prices for meat to another person who gave me all info on the  differences and tips on the Bakery as well. (I found out later that he was the Manager Jose M).  He & all the employees were very friendly,  quick to respond and  courteous - & the carne al pastor was amazing! I will definately be back.<//text>

Worst place to buy tickets, don’t buy them from here. If a baile gets cancelled they refuse to give you your money back.< /Review>

<Text>Not a bad place to find Hispanic products. Food in the restaurant is good. Meat sometimes can be a hit or miss but it is getting better when it comes to quality and serves. Store has a bad rep of selling bad meat but I can attest that it's improving. Overall it has potential.</Text><UserId.>105232365704228275915< /UserId.>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) What a horror of service leaves a lot to be desired by its employees if they do not want to work so that they stay the night at home, I don't know why they ruin the day of someone who is going to make them a good store salary to hire such disrespectful people, they treated me with such comments Rude and I am very upset since the cashiers mocking an older person who went to turn around when the door was closed.

Que horror de servicio deja mucho que desear sus empleados sino quieren trabajar que se queden a dormir en su casa no se porque le arruinan el día a alguien que va hacerles el sueldo buena tienda para contratar gente tan falta de respeto, me atendieron con comentarios tan groseros y estoy muy molesta ya que las cajeras burlandose de una persona mayor que fue a dar la vuelta al estar la puerta cerrada.< /Text>

My wife and I eat at Erik’s on a regular bases. Place is very clean, the orders are always fast, staff and management are very welcoming and friendly.  The food is always good and yummy.  By far Erik’s is one of my favorite places in Roseville to eat at.</Text>

I am from Canada and decided to take a trip down to California. I was recommended this deli and boy can I tell you that the food was the most  scrumptious I have ever had. The environment was relaxed and it was a nice place to just eat and chill. I would highly recommend coming down to this deli if you are in town :).<//review>

Speedy service, great tasting sandwiches with the right amounts of stuff on them (not too little or too much of anything).  Cannot sit down and eat there right now, but the sandwiches were fine when we got home to eat them.  Bread was fresh and not soggy with too much sauce.< /review>

<review>I was born in the bay area and have been going to Erik's deli since I was little and I love it. When I moved there was no Erik's deli and then they put one here. Definitely one of the best places to get a sandwich and soup and pasta salad. Amazing place<//review>< pics>

Nice and decent place.  I ordered the new pulled pork sandwich.  It tasted good.  It just seem empty, was just BBQ pork with buns.  Cole slaw was ok.  A slice orange was nice touch.  Overall experience was not outstanding.  Maybe will try again with different dish.<//text>

<Text>This is one of my husband & son's favorite places, ever. We used to go to Erik's in Santa Cruz when we lived there, so they were quite stoked when we got one here in Roseville! Their prices are kind of steep, but it's completely worth it to see my guys so happy. The food is yummy & always fresh. I'd recommend Erik's...and I'm happy that they have vegetarian options!</Text>< pictures>

All of us constantly crave their sandwiches!! They are just so much better than homemade. I know that they seem a little pricey but the ingredients are always stacked really high to the point where I can only eat half a sandwich at a time. Not to mention that the gluten-free bread doesn't cost any extra, it's a very good deal. Just make sure you get the rewards app, then you get points and offers in return. Their sandwiches are so good, I I try not to get the same thing every time but I usually do. I've even had them make me something that was off their menu that used to be on the menu and when I asked they said it was not a problem. We take a lot of our visiting family members here. Now that I'm leaving this review I want to go so badly!< /Review><gmapID>0x809b1ff24c66cd75:0xee713be303b0a101</gmapID><rating>5< /rating></record>

Warm roast beef sandwich was tasty w/ tomato & fresh sprouts. Pickle wedge nicely seasoned, but quite small.  Menu tilts towards warm sandwiches, soup & comfort food, but I'll definitely be back on not-too-hot days to explore more of the menu!< /review>

<Review>The clam chowder was alright but it would have been better if they included the bread bowl. I got home to find it not with my order. They can keep the carrot cake. Way too expensive for the amount of food<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x809b1ff24c66cd75:0xee713be303b0a101</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I really enjoy Erik's DeliCafe. When I lived in Santa Cruz I ate at Erik's about once a week. I'm glad a location opened up here in Roseville. The holiday sandwich is a must try along with their chilli. Great, fresh, filling food at a reasonable price.</Text>

Erik’s is always a go to place for good sandwiches and soup. Personal favorite is the Crusin’ Club and the Tomato Bisque soup.

Staff is always friendly, place is clean and quick.<//Review>

<Review>I usually come to this place at least a couple times a month. I've tried to give this place a chance because I enjoy their food. Unfortunately 9 out of 10 times I come here my order is messed up. The last time I went in not only was my warm sandwich cold but they also charged me for cheese I never asked for and also put things I asked not to be on there on both the sandwich and wrap I ordered. I've had to go back multiple times because they've messed up my order. I no longer want to come to this store which is sad because their food is actually quite good if they get your order right.< /Review>< Response>

As a native Santa Cruzian I am so happy we have an Erik's close by. Been eating their carrot cake, pilgrams progress, and chili for 25+ years! One day soon I too will run my own location here in the Sacramento Area so more California's can get this awesome and fresh home style soups, sandwiches, salads and more!< /Text>

I don't know why the ratings are so high? Yes the employees are womderful, the food on the other hand leaves ALOT to be desired. My friend ordered a Reuben and I thought it was a patty melt!!! Barely any meat or sauerkraut (I hate to say this but Arby's is better!), not to mention 2,000 mg of sodium. I had the Clam Chowder and it was watered down with corn starch and water!! Not good value for the money....< /Review>

My last visit though was much different, I really enioyed it and found their salad to be very good!

The people here are very nice and I love the historic decor of the Roseville area they have hanging everywhere.

Really makes them feel rooted in our community as a business that cares about the history of Roseville and people in it.

My wife is a huge fan pf spouts on her snadwiches and they definitly offer that which most sandwich spots don't.</review>< Date>

Food was fresh, sandwich and wrap didn't have much flavor. Tortilla soup was great but 30$ for one and a half sandwiches seems a bit much, especially for mediocre food. Won't be returning.< /review>

Good and fresh sandwiches that will you up. Thai chicken wrap is great, as the peanut sauce has a good heat to it. BUT people, if ordering to go....double check your bag for the extras! It happened again....no pickle spears today with my sandwich and I had requested a few extra! Come on....this is like the 6th time that my sauce or spears have been left behind!! Why do I tip? No more....and double checking my bag everytime at the counter from now on!!!! So - you get 4 stars on food, but1.5 stars on service!< /review>

Really great sandwiches, they even do gluten free! Prices are a bit high, but they are worth it.</Review>

On the edge of being pricey, but look where it's at. I had one of their salads and it was delicious. It filled me up.</Text>

This is a really fun place. Dozens if not 100 of flavors. Coco de oro, (chocolate pieces with caramel) and chili mango are my favorites. Also lots of sherbets and regular flavors too.<//Text>

<Text>They have a decent variety of mochi and mochi+gelato flavors.  I love that they are able to succeed in keeping the mochi texture around the gelato perfectly soft and chewy. (Whole Foods on the other hand has significantly failed in this aspect, or maybe i was just unlucky with the ones I got).</Text>< UserId.>

Rosa is a blessing of a human being in her caring kindness & her customer service is BEYOND exceptional! She was SO patient with all of our questions & was knowledgeable to answer all of them with a gracious smile (the entire time). The ice cream was absolutely delicious & I look forward to the ice cream bars we took home for later. We will be happy to visit this store for a treat at every given opportunity. ...I hope Rosa will be there to be the smiling beacon of light & joy that she is to add to the delight of our visit. Thank you, Miss Rosa. 😀
P.S.
The cucumber lemon & spinach beverages are refreshing & delicious as well. Blessings in Jesus!🙋💝💖👣👣<//text>

< review>
Seriously worst service ever! My family and I went to get specific items, 2 icecream cups, 1 chicharron preparado and 1 Chemis. First the cups were way to small, second the people there need to be properly trained because they didn't know what they were doing and speak louder also a chemis is made with fruit and icecream not fruit and cream. Also a chicharron preparado it's made with cabbage not lettuce and it's supposed to be dice tomato and some avocado wedges not pico de gallo. I just walked away and never coming back. I might not own a business but I do know how it is supposed to be run. At last but not list its 4 PM Saturday and this place had some families in there but there was not enough crew to take care of them. Very disappointed!</review>

(Translated by Google) Wow I was surprised to see so many delicious flavors. But unfortunately I ordered two quite bad Flavors. Since I opened the door it smelled unpleasantly terrible, like rotten milk, expired sour milk ... I felt like vomiting 🤢 but I thought maybe it's some chemical to clean or something ... finally I asked for lemon and eggnog, well the of eggnog has caused me nausea and "reflux"
All day, my mouth tastes like sour milk all day I have a huge disgust. And I couldn't eat lemon snow because instead of tasting acidic like lemon, it tasted bitter to me like lemon seeds. Gross !!

(Original)
Wow me sorprendí de ver tantos deliciosos sabores. Pero para mi desgracia pedí dos Sabores bastante malos . Desde que abrí la puerta olía desagradablemente terrible, como a leche podrida, a leche agria caducada ... sentí ganas de vomitar 🤢 pero pensé quizá es algún químico para limpiar o algo  así... en fin pedí de limón y rompope, bueno la de rompope me ha causado nauseas y “reflujo”
Todo el día, mi boca me sabe a leche agria todo el día tengo un asco inmenso. Y l nieve de limón no la pude comer porque en vez de saber ácida como el limón, me supo amarga como las semillas de limón. Que asco !!<//Text>

If you are buying a home, you want Colleen to inspect it! She is extremely knowledgable, professional, thorough, and responsive. We had a few follow-up questions after receiving the report, and she was more than happy to take the time to answer our questions. We highly recommend Colleen from AmeriSpec!</review>

<Text>I was blown away by the professionality, courteousness, and the friendliness Jeff Clark, the local inspector, showed my real estate agent and I. He provided an in-depth analysis of all the key items he noticed after giving a walk through of the home in Long Beach. I am grateful my realtor put me in touch with AmeriSpec. I will definitely use them again in the future for another home. Jeff, you need a pay raise! Thank you!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Colleen is the best inspector we’ve had in our twenty years of home buying. Thorough, attentive, and delivers incredible A+ customer service. Report turnaround is also the fastest we’ve ever experienced and of the highest quality. Highly recommend.<//Text>

<Review>Collen Brand of Amerispec was very clear and balanced in her verbal report to my buyer clients.  The home was very charming but very old and  Colleen helped my buyer to prioritze the needed repairs, as well as the secondary inspections.  My only problem is that she is so much in
demand that we have to wait for her availability.  But we do wait.

Colleen Brand with Amerispec is simply the best. She is timely, extremely meticulous and thorough. She is my go to inspector every time. Her report is so thorough and well laid out that it allows us to build a great case for repair negotiations. I feel good that my buyers will know every detail and condition of the home before they buy. A bonus is that Colleen is such a pleasure to be around. I give her a 100/10.< /review>

For our home inspection, we scheduled AmeriSpec, plus a mold and termite inspector all to investigate on the same day, costing $2K combined. AmeriSpec flagged all the issues and the house failed each inspection. We did not buy that house but found a condo, and initially only scheduled AmeriSpec to inspect. Why? Because if it fails AmeriSpec’s investigation, there’s no need pay for the other specialists to inspect it. No one does it better than AmeriSpec!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have used AmeriSpec for two home inspections (both as a broker and a buyer) now and both times they have provided me with the most detailed and thorough reports. They made themselves available for questions afterwards and set me up with software to make all the information easily accessible. I will continue to use them for all my future home inspections.</Text>

<review>I would use this company again and I would recommend it to anyone that is purchasing a new home. On time, reliable and expert at inspection service. I had questions and the inspector had answers, in fact I was told to call if any other questions came up later. I love that! That’s complete service with a smile. I was told what was wrong with the house I was purchasing and how it could be remedied. Very grateful to my real estate agent for recommending this inspector.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Colleen Brand is an excellent inspector. She’s prompt, professional, and thorough. She was able to squeeze my buyers in last minute to accommodate a very short contingency window. She is top notch all around and we would highly recommend her to anyone in the future!< /text>

<text>I am a real estate agent. Colleen is a true professional. She has spent a lot of time off the clock learning building code- when she inspects a property she gives it a thorough checking out. I have found that she communicates complicated issues very simply in easy to understand terms. I would have Colleen inspect my house when I can finally afford one! :-P< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Colleen was amazing! I was a first-time home buyer investing my whole financial future in a century-old property that's been flipped, so there was a lot at stake, a lot that could be wrong, and a lot that was completely new to me and overwhelming. She was so thorough and professional while at the same time being very personable and good at explaining things in lay terms. The seller's agent was present when she presented her findings and tried to push back on some of the defects she identified, and she was ready to back up all of her observations with clear photos and explanations of how the work should have looked if it had been done properly. The seller fixed most of what we asked for, and we're now happy in our home, knowing that everything is in good working order for our family, thanks to a follow-up inspection by Colleen! I felt absolutely confident in her inspection report, and that's not something I can say about the majority of the home buying process.</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Colleen did a very thorough inspection on a house in escrow. Unknown to me, a sleazy realtor (Bulldog Realtors in Venice, CA) was trying to sell me a house with extensive structural damage. Thanks to the awesome services from AmeriSpec, I avoided being defrauded by a bad realtor, buying a hazardous property, and can look forward in my search for a home. Highly recommend Colleen. Thank you for your expertise, experience and your candor!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

Colleen did a fantastic job.  Very efficient and thorough.  When we needed a structural engineer she was able to refer someone and she was available to answer questions even after her job was done.  I would def use her again.< /text>

Best buying experience ever. Obviously a business and in business to make money, but more than fair about it and with great customer service. Should offer courses in customer service management to other local dealers!< /review>

<text>This was an excellent car buying experience (which sounds even as weird to write as it probably is to read). Jhovan was fantastic and did everything he said he was going to do. He facilitated my purchase from out of state and was flexible in allowing me to pick the car up at my convenience (coming from the east coast). I will definitely work with him again in the future. Once again, I recommend this team to anyone looking to get a luxury automobile.</text>< pictures>

Angel Moreno made our experience of buying our first Porsche a delight. He was super responsive and he kept us updated on all the process and next steps until he was able to deliver the car. The whole process was flawless and everyone involved were very professional, so I definitely recommend Porsche Ontario as your Porsche dealership!<//Text>

<Text>Ontario Porsche is a five star red carpet dealer. Gilbert assisted me with my purchase and stayed late without even any pressure to finish the deal so he could go home and even offered to help me set up my phone and go over some features.  I had made two trips to the dealership to test drive a Macan and he was very patient with zero pressure. Shelby was amazing in finance to deal with made me feel like part of the family. We drove about 4 and a half hours and it was worth the drive. Highly recommend them.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNocH1AFF_5YrRDnKdgD4Ldnv-DvHzGK_DeC13C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt_T3GT-BQ0Xt6JhNKirMh7iTLbugrwXMTzP7B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>Patrick Posey was very helpful. I don’t like to go to any car dealerships when shopping for vehicles.
I always get anxiety when doing so.  Patrick greeted me with warm welcome the 1st time when I visited the dealership and had put me at much ease. His team is great. The financing manager Shelly is awesome. I would strongly recommend this dealership if you are looking for a Porsche. The excellent service elevates the experience when you are shopping for a higher ticket item.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< username>

The service was amazing! Sha was my sales rep and he made the purchase of my car seamless! He followed up with me during for 3 months as my lease for my BMW was coming due and when the car in the color and specs that I wanted came in, he didn’t forget about me and called me right away to have me come in.  Thank you sha for helping me purchase my first Porsche!</Review>

Great dealership on the luxury vehicle. We had great shopping experience with one salesman Jhovan Coronado . He was very helpful for the first Porsche shopper as us. He was a honest salesman which could keep his words. Happy to make a deal with this place and if we need any extra Porsche in our garage, we will definitely come back to Jhovan with no doubt .<//text>

I visited a few Porsche dealerships looking for the right car. Porsche Ontario out shined them all. The facilities are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and professional. Patrick Posey was a super star. From my initial emails to the completion of my purchase, he was always responsive, helpful and knowledgeable. Shelly Fisher was also fantastic to work with with. They both made the entire experience a pleasure. I highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a Porsche.< /text>

I have nothing but great things to say about my recent Taycan leasing experience with Sales Ambassador Gilbert Villagrana and Finance Ambassador Shelly Fisher III.  Both were ultra professional and helpful at every stage.  I emailed the dealership about a Taycan 4S that had just arrived, and heard back from Gilbert the same day, with a video of the car.  The next day we negotiated a very competitive lease price, and I put down a deposit to hold the car.  I then discovered I needed a bigger battery and asked Gilbert to find me a different 4S, in a hard-to-find color, with other desired options.  Diring the next two weeks he scoured all available and incoming inventory at dealerships throughout Ca and neighboring states, keeping me posted along the way.  Eventually Gilbert found just the right car coming into another dealership.

Even though Porsche Ontario needed to swap a car with a dealership hundreds of miles away to get me the one I wanted, they honored the original price we had negotiated for a car in their inventory.  The day after I signed the lease, Gilbert drove 6 hours to pick up my car at the other dealership, dropped his own car off, and then drove my car another 3 hours further to deliver it to my home.  I told him he didn't need to do that, but Gilbert wanted to configure the PCM and other systems, explain the car's features, and answer any questions I might have.  He then Ubered back to the other dealership to pick up his own car and return home.  All on a Friday!  During the next week Gilbert checked in regularly and helped answer my follow-up questions.  The Taycan is a complicated car and this proved very helpful.  How's that for going the extra mile?

Shelly was also great to deal with.  I've come to dread the usual finance department add-on pitches and hard sells.  That's not what I encountered with Shelly.  He explained the add-on packages that Porsche makes available, made straightforward recommendations about what he thought made sense for a lessee, and completely left it to me to decide with no pressure whatsoever.  Shelly also arranged for me to docu-sign all the papers and expedited completion of my lease.

I'm an attorney, I dislike surprises, and I know when someone is trying to game me. I encountered none of that.  On the contrary, I have never had a better car buying/leasing experience with any brand or dealership.   Not even close.   These gentlemen are the best, bar none.  I would do business again with either of them, and with the Porsche Ontario dealership, in a flash.

As for the Taycan 4S, it's a high spirited thing of beauty.  I  have never driven anything quite like this solid rocket. After blast off, you can just sit back and enjoy the sound system, which also delivers the best acoustic experience I've ever had.   Nice work Porsche.  Now I'm thinking 12k/year will not be enough.</Review>

Amazing Customer Service from start to finish.  Our experience with Megan Breunig was so wonderful, she represents the Porsche brand with pride and it shows!  Her attention to detail, efficiency, professionalism stands out.  Even more so, Megan makes sure you are taken care of in all aspects and that you are truly getting the full Porsche experience.

<review>I am in awe of this facility. I am an avid car enthusiast. Especially a Porsche enthusiast and have been in the automotive industry for quite some time. Porsche Ontario has the best customer service, hands down. Everyone you meet that works there seem to be a car. Enthusiast (which is rare) I have frequented this facility multiple times and every single time my experience has been the same: Exceptional! Manni, Jaime and Mark are the absolute best! I recently had my car serviced and they pulled every string possible for me. They did the impossible and went out of their way that no dealership has ever done for me before. I am thoroughly satisfied with this dealership and will not only continue to service my vehicles here, but will also continue to praise and refer clientes here.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
We had a wonderful experience with Porsche Ontario sales. From initial contact with the dealership to driving away in our new Porsche, the entire team was responsive, thorough, friendly, courteous, and exceptional to work with. Primo Garcia was fantastic. We connected early on about a Porsche that we unfortunately couldn't come to final terms on. However, once a couple of other options became available, Primo and his colleague Patrick Posey provided us prompt and complete information. Never did we feel pressured to make a quick, uninformed decision. It was a thorough process and we felt very good about our final decision. Even when we took our time, they still never made us feel like we were monopolizing their time. At the end, we know we made the right decision for us. And when we decided to sell our other Porsche, Pouya made us a great offer that made it very easy to sell it to them. And the great experience extends to the finance department, where Shelly made the process easy and complete. In the future, will definitely reach back out when another Porsche is in our sights.</Review>

<text>My wife and I just purchased a Porsche Taycan from Porsche Ontario in California. We had visited several dealerships prior to choosing this place. On our first visit we were extremely impressed with the knowledge and demeanor of our salesperson, Christian Agraso. He answered our questions and went a lot further in describing his personal feelings regarding the car as well as this new Porsche dealership. After we chose to purchase there, Christian helped us build the car with all the options we desired. He didn’t hesitate to let us know which options we wouldn’t need and only recommended those extras that would enhance the vehicle’s performance and cosmetic appearance. His honesty was very obvious to my wife and me. From the time we confirmed our order for the exact car we desired, Christian continued to be accessible 24-7 to answer our questions. Finally upon picking up the vehicle yesterday, he spent many hours orientating us to the many aspects of this new beautiful vehicle. We were also impressed with the Finance Manager, Michael Cordona who was also very knowledgeable and honest in helping us decide on some insurance options for maintenance and wear and tear.
IN SUMMARY, ONTARIO PORSCHE reminds me of the old Avis Commercial which stated, “WE TRY HARDER”<//text>< pictures>

<username>Gerald C<//username><Time>1611105445254<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Absolutely loved my experience here!! I look young and when i went to other Dealerships nobody even gave me the time of day to go over the numbers of the vehicles i came for. Megan was my salesperson and she approached me right away. She was very friendly and  went over all my wants and needs. She went over all my questions and was straight-forward with all the numbers. The estimate she gave me was the same from start to finish. Would 100% recommend her to anyone looking to purchase here. Thanks for helping me find the perfect GT4 for me megan!

I purchased a used Tesla Model S from Ontario Porsche and I can honestly say that it was the best car buying experience of my life….mainly due to the salesperson I worked with, Primo Garcia.  Primo is super diligent, honest, and sincere.  He blasted through the paperwork and hooked me up with coffee, snacks, and nice conversation.  He also had the vehicle I brought to the dealership washed and drove it back to my house (40 minutes away) so that I could take my new car home!!!:-). If you want a first class experience all the way around, work with Primo Garcia at Porsche Ontario…you will not be disappointed!!!<//Text>

Porsche Ontario and my salesman, Jhovan Coronado, far exceeded my expectations when it comes to car buying experiences. The transaction was smooth, fast, and stress free! Jhovan was always available via phone, text, or email with regular updates about my order. The sales manager, Dan Ebach, was also outstanding and a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend Jhovan and the entire staff at Porsche Ontario!</text>

I found an offer I want on Porscheontario.com and chatted with them at the same time. I felt very comfortable to schedule an appointment as my requested. After finishing chatting, I got a text message with confirming my appointment and advising the address as well which is very helpful to me.  Their location is very easy to find. Once walking into the building, I got very warm welcome and had been taken care of right away. I mentioned I was interested in that 2020 new Macan special offer. The sales person Patrick went to drive that car to the front and instructed me for a test drive. I like the car very much. Then Patrick worked on my lease of that car very professionally. I felt I made a super right decision to go to Porsche Ontario. It's a very happy experience to me. I am sure I will recommend this dealer to my friends.</Text>

Exceptional staff in a beautiful facility.   Primo Garcia provided first class customer service on a recent visit to check out a pre owned car.  People are friendly and the dealership is pristine and very well managed.   I was genuinely impressed and enjoyed my experience at this dealership, plus they have plenty of eye candy for the auto enthusiast.   If I lived close, I would visit just for fun.  Thank you, Primo.<//Review>

My most recent car service experience with Porsche Ontario is astounding.
It is my second time here and never did I expect that car service at a dealership is consistently exceptional.
The service department here  is extremely brilliant, sincerely accommodating and precisely thorough. I think Kevin Hayes made that all happen.
This is my first Porsche, not in my wildest dream that an amazing brand like this is supported by an equally amazing dealership like Porsche Ontario.<//review>

I recently Purchased a new Panamera 4 for my wife. We traded in her Mercedes Benz. My experience was actually very good. We arrived at the dealer and was greeted by Megan Breunig. A very nice young lady who took us on the test drive. She was very knowledgeable about the vehicle, and very personable. I fully expected her to pass us off to another Sales person or Manager after the test drive, but it never happened. Nice thing about the dealership was I dealt with Megan start to finish. It was nice to deal with one person start to finish, that usually never happens. We worked on the numbers of the new car which was fairly straight forward, as the dealership had the vehicle I was interested in priced very fair to begin with. Where I usually have the issue is with the trade in. That is when things generally go south. They offered me from the beginning, what I felt was a very fair price for my trade in. I had already done my research so I knew what a fair offer was, and what I would accept. We made some minor adjustments on the numbers came to an agreement and my wife drove home the car of her dreams. It was really just that simple! The entire staff was awesome but Megan went the extra mile and never once pressured me. She listened to my concerns, work for me to make sure I was happy with my purchase and that I was completely satisfied. After the paperwork was complete it was time to take delivery.  Megan made sure my wife knew everything about her new car. She took her time explaining everything, how it works, set up her phone, and I could not have been  more pleased. Usually there is a quick once over and they send you on your way. Then its up to me to figure out the car and explain it all to my wife. It was by all accounts, a very good experience start to finish. Cannot say enough about Megan and the staff at Porsche Ontario. Our sincere thanks!

All of the service was explained and my questions answered.

If you buy any Porsche products, this is THE place you need to go. I just purchased 2021 911 4s Cab from Jhovan at Porsche Ontario, his service was way beyond extra ordinary ! Everything was done as professionally and prompt!  I can't wait to go back there to purchase a another one again in the future.  +AAAAAAAAAA Porsche dealer for sure!</review>

I made an appointment to test drive the car. I met with him on the lot he gave me some necessary information to test drive the car. He sat in the back with his mask on and answered any question I had for him. He was very professional, and very courteous. I could not go back to buy the car right away so asked him if he would hold the car for me until the next day he said he would keep it in the back. When my husband & I met with him to purchase the car he was honest and open, I did feel that he was helping me to get the best deal. After all the paperwork were done he sat on the passenger side and explained every single button that I needed to know on the car. He was a gentleman he gave me his number and told me to call him anytime with any question. Overall I gave my experience with him & the dealership ten out of ten!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I stopped by a few dealerships looking a Panameras, but couldn’t find the right fit until I went to Ontario. Megan was exceptional. She took the time, and had the knowledge, to educate me on all the features of the vehicle I was interested in. She wasn’t pushy and was extremely kind. I told her I only had an hour to purchase the vehicle and she was able to make that happen. I had a great experience and would highly recommend this dealership and Megan in particular.<//Review>

Had inquired online about a 911 and received a friendly call from Patrick Posey. Invited me to go over and test drive the car. He is a pleasant guy to work with. Told him I would come back once I made some calculations. He gave me the best deal after having talked to BH dealer. Thank you for making my first Porsche purchase experience a great one!

Overall my experience at Porsche Ontario is superb . From the time of my arrival until i left the dealer with my new 2021 Porsche Cayman GTS 4.0  . Especially to Patrick Posey  my agent who helped me alot with  the introduction to my new Porsche he made sure everything was clear    to me  , he took his time explaining the details of the car .  And also to the finance agent  that made the paperworks  quick and easy . Thank you Patrick for your professional assistance in making my  experience  at Porsche Ontario very pleasant . Hoping if i can get another Porsche it will be in Ontario again .< /text>

{'time': 1614368704273, 'text': 'Mr. Sing,\nI have to be honest here and say I’m really dumbfounded that you would make these accusations since they are so far from the truth it’s laughable. You wanted to buy a Panamera from us in California and ship it to your home in Texas, no problem, we do 10-15 deals like this a month. Now we need some sort of commitment from you that you are really buying this car so we don’t sell it to someone else while the paperwork is finished, so we ask for a CC deposit which we do not even run. Then we need to get proof of your income to get you financed; you provided a document that was not accepted by the bank. We then asked you for the documents the banks asked for and you did not send them and therefore we cannot get you financed. That’s when you began calling with profanity laced verbal assaults on our team members. Now, you feel that it’s ok to write these libelous reviews as further retribution because you didn’t get financed. Mr. Sing, we sell lots of cars all over the country and have very little issue doing it; the reason you don’t have the car is that you cannot prove your income in a manner that is acceptable to the bank. Furthermore, we do not want to do business with you. Your behavior and abuse is something we will not subject our team to any longer. We encourage you to please take your business elsewhere.\n\nMark Marchant\nGeneral Manager\nPorsche Ontario\n(909) 292-1939'}</resp>

I bought my car and I had the pleasure of getting Alex Montiel as my salesperson. Alex was super professional, very quick responses (even at 11pm at night), sent personal videos of the car I was interested in and took very good care of me. I spoke with other dealers and decided to purchase my car from Porsche Ontario because of Alex. Alex, thank you for all your help and making this car buying experience seamless and fun!</text>

Awesome car buying experience at Porsche Ontario, especially my sales advisor, JB Beitz.  He handled the complicated out of state purchase like a veteran.  He has been selling cars for many years, and knows all the minute details that are required to get the job done.  Two huge thumbs up to JB and Porsche Ontario.</review>

< Review>
My boyfriend and I went to five different car dealerships and made Porsche Ontario our last stop. I had the Macan in the back of my mind when we walked in and we were greeted by Jonathan. We walked around discussing a few options and ended up picking out one of the smaller suv's we liked. My boyfriend and I were debating back and forth and we had no pressure whatsoever from Jonathan who was very professional and knowledgeable. He helped us make a decision, which was a pretty big decision for me choosing a luxury suv like this. We are very happy to have purchased from Porsche Ontario, everyone was super nice and friendly, great experience! Shelley in finance was also great helping us with all the paperwork. Last but least, absolutely love driving the Macan!</Review>

My 911 had a high pressure fuel pump failure while driving on the highway. I immediately stopped at Porsche Ontario and before I was even out of the car, David Barron was at the car diagnosing the problem. Within 20 minutes I was checked in, car was taken into the service bay and I was driving home in a beautiful Macan S as a loaner. David kept me updated via text throughout the service. Porsche Ontario and more specifically David Barron made the experience 5 stars. Also, this is my second Porsche and highly recommend asking for Bob Macdonald when it comes time to buy one. He lives and breathes Porsche! Thanks David, Bob and Ontario Porsche.< /Text>

< Review>
Initially, I was looking to purchase a low mileage,  certified preowned car from a local Porsche dealership in the San Diego area, and after much online searching, I was surprised to find that the exact car I was looking for was at Porsche Ontario.  I contacted the dealership through their online chat and was immediately helped out by Christian Agraso ( Porsche brand ambassador), who confirmed that they had the vehicle on the lot and sent me pics and a short video of the car.  Within 10-15 minutes, (and I really mean 10-15 minutes!) Christian and I were able to come to a price point I was comfortable with and filled out some of the paperwork online.  I set up a time to pick up the car that same day and drove to the dealership (very nice, modern and new Porsche dealership!).  Christian Agraso met me almost immediately and took me to the car to test drive and go over the car details, (the car was also immaculately detailed inside and out!) I signed the remaining paperwork with Shelly (finance manager who was also friendly and professional!).  Within 20 minutes I was ready to roll!  I have purchased vehicles online and over the phone before, but this by far, was the easiest, smoothest and best car purchase I have ever had!  If you ever need to pirchase a Porsche, I would highly recommend Porsche Ontario and Christian Agraso! They also have several electric charging stations on site and was able to charge my electric vehicle!  Thanks Christian and Porsche Ontario!< /Review>

{'time': 1614368614787, 'text': 'Mr. Sing,\nI have to be honest here and say I’m really dumbfounded that you would make these accusations since they are so far from the truth it’s laughable.  You wanted to buy a Panamera from us in California and ship it to your home in Texas, no problem, we do 10-15 deals like this a month. Now we need some sort of commitment from you that you are really buying this car so we don’t sell it to someone else while the paperwork is finished, so we ask for a CC deposit which we do not even run.  Then we need to get proof of your income to get you financed; you provided a document that was not accepted by the bank.  We then asked you for the documents the banks asked for and you did not send them and therefore we cannot get you financed.  That’s when you began calling with profanity laced verbal assaults on our team members. Now,  you feel that it’s ok to write these libelous reviews as further retribution because you didn’t get financed. Mr. Sing, we sell lots of cars all over the country and have very little issue doing it; the reason you don’t have the car is that you cannot prove your income in a manner that is acceptable to the bank.  Furthermore, we do not want to do business with you. Your behavior and abuse is something we will not subject our team to any longer.  We encourage you to please take your business elsewhere.\n\nMark Marchant\nGeneral Manager\nPorsche Ontario\n(909) 292-1939'}</resp>

Porsche Ontario saves the day. My car broke down as we were driving to a weekend get away on a Friday afternoon. The service manager Manni was so helpful and considerate. Manni went out of his way to run a diagnostic on the car, thankfully the issue was not severe. The dealership had the needed part in stock and repaired the car that same Friday afternoon. The service shop is large and also impeccable. Besides the service area, the showroom is beautiful, spacious and modern, representative of the Porsche’s on display. Truly beautiful performance vehicles. Everyone we encountered was helpful and accommodating ( putting  a kids channel on the tv for my child) . I highly recommend Porsche Ontario for all Porsche needs. Thank you!!!<//review>

Just purchased a 2020 Macan S from Porsche Ontario. Not only is this new dealership absolutely beautiful, but Megan Breunig, who worked with me was professional, beyond friendly and also super knowledgeable, which made the whole experience a most pleasant one.

<rate>2</rate><Text>I just purchased a 2020 911 Carrera Cabriolet from the dealership through Alex Montiel as salesman. Both Alex and everyone else at the dealership was helpful and respectful. I would highly recommend Alex so ask for him by name. He is professional and always willing to help

UPDATE:

As of today my new vehicle has been in the Ontario service department for over a week after I drove it home and one other time and sadly the Porsche Connect hasn’t worked correctly from the evening I bought the car. After some research, I’ve discovered that the PCM not working on many Porsche cars is a known problem dating back at least to 2015 from what I can find. To me that means all Porsche dealers know about this issue and are still selling these cars and allowing customers to drive them off their lot saying things like- “it will connect once you get out into the open Air and the signal comes through!”  That’s what I was told and it was a lie, plain and simple. If you decide to buy a Porsche with a PCM, DO NOT DRIVE OFF THE LOT, unless you know the PCM is fully functioning or you’ll be in the same position I’m in now. You’ve been fore warned.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Beautiful new menus. But cut out half the normal drinks and raised the prices. Plus charge you extra without posting any extra pricing on the board. Been going there for years. Today am deeply disappointed. Bought a Zone drink with whey, like I often do - which is already pricey. Then because of whey protein I am surprisingly charged an extra dollar. Felt very cheated, esp as there is no mention of "extra $1 for whey". I don't like soy but get penalized for whey. Not sure if I'll return there unless I have coupons. Drinks are getting waaay too expensive and not worth it.<//Review>

<review>This is the best raw juice bar in town. Everyone should try the Awakener or the Energizer. They also make great smoothies, the staff is friendly and the service is quick.</review></record>

Look at their fixed finished... Funny is they passed inspection with (the city Agent Jennifer )  you be the judge ...< /text>< response>

<review>I only have GREAT things to say about INEZ and GLORIA they make a super team. They have really helped me out many times. They calm me down. Those two have done a great job. Also like to THANK, Terry Hood, who was always a good sport when I would bug her about things.  Thanks, Sue<//review>< time>

I’ve worked with Amanda at Regency so many times and she continues to provide excellent service! Her knowledge in property management and real estate make her and Regency my go to person for all things real estate! They do such a wonderful job managing all of my tenants, and are always available to help! Amanda handles all of property sales as well and she is alway so professional, and has the best communication! I highly recommend her!<//Review>

<Text>Regency Property Management has been not only a blessing these the hardships of the pandemic, but also on a personal level as well. I give special credit to Debi Lenox, who has, from the beginning, always expressed herself in a professional, yet friendly manner. Debi has exceeded my expectations and provided me with a sense of trust and confidence in property management which I have never had before. Keep up the good work! I would recommend Regency Property Management to anybody looking in the area. I, myself, plan to continue to work with this agency in the future, when planning my next move! Thank you so much for everything!< /Text>< Pics>

The staff at Regency Property Management was very friendly, responsive, and attentive to my renting needs.  It's always a pleasure working with Gabriela, Amanda and Aida. They were easy to work with and were very professional and knowledgeable to any questions that I had.  I would definitely recommend Regency for rental properties or the management of your own property.  Great team!< /Review>

Inez and Gloria do a great job of managing my rental properties. Sometimes they are a little slow to get back to me but, that is totally understandable considering this dreadful pandemic year. They have really stayed ahead of the negative issues that it has brought to the property management industry. I truly appreciate all their hard work and successful results, and would highly recommend Regency to any rental property owners in the Fresno area.

I was remiss in my review above in that Iforgot to mention that Terry and all the accounting folks do a wonderful job at keeping the books and sending out timely monthly, yearly statements and tax documents.Terry always answers the phone and provides me with answers to my questions.

Also, Brad was awesome for what he managed to do for evicting a large group of squatters who had a false lease.</Text>

<Review>Very pleased with Regency's attention to customer service. My primary point of contact with the company has been Gloria who has always been professional and courteous no matter my concern. Whenever there's a problem, she's been quick to respond. I'll definitely be recommending Regency to my friends.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I went to several places & nope didn't like the people, because of the way they treated me, like I was just someone else.
So I gave your company a shot & it was fantastic in fact Brandon treated me like a friend and very knowledgeable and friendly. He made me feel very comfortable and I was able to talk and he listened to me not like everybody else but he listened and he cared that is a very rare thing. Thank you Brandon very much. I can and will recommend regency properties management because of you Brandon.
Fantastic 👍</review>

<Review>Gloria and Inez were wonderful to work with when my client decided to sell his property that they managed.  They helped make the transaction go really smooth.  Every time I needed a financial document they emailed it over the same day, if I had a question they answered it the same day, if I needed to schedule inspections or the appraisal they had notices served quickly....all i had to do was ask!  Gloria also physically on site when needed made sure we could get into every unit we needed to, even when tenants made it difficult.

I can't say enough kind things about them, I can't wait to work with them again.  They are extremely professional and helpful.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809467ccb371b557:0xc497ef8c6c209136</gmap_id></record>

She motivates me to be a better man. Thank you for always providing EXCELLENT service and always putting a smile on my face.<//review>

<text>I love living here.  Great neighbors, gardeners do excellent work, management are strict, but I really like that they don’t allow ANYTHING, to cheapen the appearance or privacy.  I’m trying to qualify for a better refinance of my mortgage, and hoping the appraisal goes okay.  Thanks for all you do!</text>< Pics>

I've been working with property Manager Amanda for several years and she is always on top of everything I request and always willing to go above and beyond to get things right. Regency management is a very reputable and professional company to work with. Amanda has always been quick, diligent, efficient, and at the front of every concern I have and always resolving anything that comes up. Highly recommend for landlords and future tenants.<//Review>

I been doing some research on moving to Fresno. I been looking for a nice place to live for about 6 months, most places I called just don’t have time to explain the whole process but after speaking to Mari my decision has been made. Not only did she have the patience to answer all my questions over the phone but she did so with such professionalism! She explained every step I need to make to make this move as smooth as possible. Thank you Mari highly recommend her!< /Review>

<Text>Arlene and the staff at Regency have been an invaluable asset for our Association. They are conscientious, flexible, and professional. After dealing with an out-of-town management company before, partnering with a local company that knows and anticipates their clients needs is a breath of fresh air. Regency really goes to bat for the community and their efforts take a lot of the stress from the Board.</Text>< pics>

She didn’t left me alone during the whole process, and I felt very happy with her service. Thank you Amanda. I will recommend you to my family and friends.<//text>

Thanks to Gloria we do not have to worry about finding renters, maintenance, or anything else having to do with the property.

<Review>I went through them for a home years ago and they made the process very simple....they run your credit once and will store it for a year I believe so you can look at different options and not have to rerun your credit each time which I absolutely loved.

I lived in the home for a few years and they made it easy to get things fixed or repaired.  You just call and ask for a work order for any issues and they will come and fix it.

Amanda Santana specifically...is such an amazing asset to the company and for clients. She is professional and has a great attitude to point you in the right direction for your family and fit.< /Review>< name>

Good quality service from staff members, in a timely fashion. I know Vanessa very well....she knows how to handle each of the situations and answers all questions that always come up. Seems like staff is always going to her for help as much as most of tenants do as well.  Regency should hire more people like her, and with the same qualities that she has, nice, attentive, professional, and always courteous. She’s my go to person!!! Good job on who might have hired her when they did!</Review>

We have been with regency properties since 2013 and couldn't be more happier with them. They manage multiple properties for us and provide a great experience for the property owner.  From responsiveness to your questions and excellent accounting from people like Terry Hood in the bookkeeping department. It really makes it easy when tax time rolls around and we have a such a complete report to provide our accountant. Also from new features like client portal and p&l statements every month. Five stars all the way around for regency properties.

The local frozen yogurt place. The kids got their ice cream, and we spoke about future projects and he delivered what was requested at a time when he was not obligated to do so at all, and could have just simply waited until Monday. His efforts are much appreciated by myself as well as my superiors, I’m hoping to continue to do business with Brandon because I’m completely comfortable with knowing that just as I want him to know he can count on us for repairs he’s requesting, I can count on him per my requests, even after hours. Thanks Brandon!!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Terry Hood and everyone at Regency are amazing to work with. She has been managing my portfolio for a number of years and I couldn't be more pleased by her professional, thoughtful and invaluable assistance. The key factor in our working relationship is trust, which she has earned time and again over the years. She and everyone at Regency are also a delight to work with.
All the best,

Our HOA acquired the services of Regency Property Management several years ago when the performance of another firm declined. The personal commitment of Arlene (Our property Manager) and her assistant have since never wavered. In spite of often competing priorities, she is steadfast in keeping our finances in order and the Board of Directors updated. When the Board faced crucial  decisions or challenging issues, her advice or assistance has been instrumental in seeking successful outcomes. Thus, without hesitation I recommend Regency for Property Management services.< /text>

I've worked with Regency for a few years now & they are extremely professional & helpful. Amanda Santana is an absolute rockstar & she has always been able to help me out on various projects when I need her. She's also very knowledgeable with anything you might need, from evictions, to city regulations, etc. She's saved me a lot of time & money! I'm thankful that I found someone as helpful as Amanda to help guide me in my real estate ventures.<//text>

<text>We had a great experience with Regency Property Management, i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company to any of my friends or relatives. We got the place we were looking for and my wife is happy,  I'm pretty sure we owe it to Brandon Waters. I have to say he made the process easier, he is informative, communicative and in my opinion good at what he does.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I think her name was Vanessa. She is undoubtedly one of the most compassionate people that has helped me. She didn’t seem fake. I actually felt like she genuinely wants to help me and others. I would recommend her , 105%. Thank you, Regency & Vanessa!</review>

My position in my organization has given me the opportunity to work with many management companies and property managers over the years. Amanda Santana with Regency has been responsive, understanding and dependable in our work together. I honestly feel that the work we’ve done has been for the betterment of many properties, neighborhoods and the City as a whole.< /text>

I have had the pleasure of working with Brandon Waters as it relates to our property located at 4781 No. Polk, Units 131, 132 and 133 in Fresno.
i have found Mr. Waters to be responsive and great to work and yet very professional in his
approach to getting things done.
This was not the case in dealing with Regency Property Mgnt. in the past.
In other areas this is still the  NOT the case. Brandon is a credit to your organization.<//review>

As an HOA Board Member, I enjoy working with Mikki Martinez. She is so knowledgeable and very practical in dealing  with issues that come up.  She knows the legal ends of things but recognizes that our residents are people, each with their own story and is willing to work with  them if they meet her half-way.  She has reduced our past dues and recommended good vendors.  Her good sense of humor goes a long way to lighten long or difficult deliberations.  I highly recommend Regency Property Management.</Text>

Regency Property Management is great and generous company. They go out of their way to help individuals less fortunate.  They go above and beyond the call of duty. Highly recommend! 👍🏼< /review>

Iv been dealing with regency for over four years now as a renter and vendor, it has been nothing short of a good experience! Brandon Waters has been the best property manager I have had the opportunity to deal with, he is very responsive, professional and approaches daily operations with the intent to better his assigned communities.<//Review>

<text>When Regency Property Management,  Said we can provide you with quality services and a professional organization to help you along your journey,  I said we will see. That was four years ago,  we were at 33% fully funded. Today 100% fully funded and Happy.  Not only does our team Gina,  Arlene and Charlotte,  provide outstanding service to our community they are part of our family. We at the Height of Loma Vista (HLV) would not be enjoying our lifestyles, our beautiful community without them.  They have made my life as Board President a piece of cake.  Thank you Regency for what you have done and the things we have planned for the future.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809467ccb371b557:0xc497ef8c6c209136< /GmapID></record>

The team at Regency Property Management is and has always been very professional in questions I have had in the past. I have had the privilege to speak with Terry Hood on numerous occasions. She is very knowledgeable and always a pleasure to speak with regarding questions I have had. As a home owner, I know I can trust this company if need be.<//review>

I stood in line for 45 minutes at the rental office with more than 30 other angry people because the women at the front desk were incompetent and rude. I don't understand how this company can still function with how inept they are. They have 7+ company cars out front at all times and yet they can't afford to pay for simple fixes and repairs on their properties? I had to fix my own windows in my rental after their panes we're separating from their frames and I continued to hear nothing from Regency regarding the matter. Their customer service is awful. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. If you ever have to do business with them be aware of what you might be getting into. They only care about lining their own pockets and looking pretty.<//Text>

In regards to waiting in line, I am sorry. Due to Covid we had to limit our office exposure. However, you can pay online completely free using a checking or savings account number. Or you can pay using cash at any 7-11 or Walmart store. When you call me I can go over those options more in detail. I look forward to talking to you.'}</Response>

Not very professional of some of the women in the front of the office. Don't go near closing because they will leave with you standing there waiting and say nothing. I stood there thinking they were just going around the building to get back inside. Multiple people waited as well.< /Text>

< Review>
My husband is a u.s Army veteran and when we moved into our apartment a different company owned it. Regency recently purchased this property a couple months ago. First thing they did was start sending out letters about rent right away. Then followed that up with letters stating all objects had to be removed from our porches to keep the property looking nice, mind you the porch was barely big enough to hold 2 rocking chairs. Their maintenance man didn't fix anything. I had asked several times even prior to them buying the place for him to replace the window cranks and the knobs in my shower which poured a steady stream of scalding hot water. The wear and tear on the apt were normal. Nails in the walls, the toilet over flowed and flooded out our entire apartment, we were blamed for clogging it when there had been issues from the start. Always a bandaid fix with this guy. The carpet had to be pulled due to that and bc their policy is you had pets.. Carpet comes out.. Which was never tacked properly Anyways. Flash forward to today. I call to see about our deposit. And I am told we owe money. Mind you the v.a put a double deposit down. And march rent was paid. But apparently we owe for marches rent (835$) a late fee for marches rent (75$) 4 days of april (75$) plus whatever repairs they deem necessary. In short probably all of it. I wouldn't recommend doing business here. They seem to be trying to cheat people out of money.< /Review>

I stand by what I said. I've been a tenant of this property company for a long time and it's always been the same terrible customer service. The girls are rude and unprofessional. It takes a very long time for anything to get done and when things are done corners are cut when dealing with damages and repairs. The review spam is very low and misleading.</text>< rate>

its unfortunate that i have to give 2 stars. Really unprofessional services, maintenance is slow, i had broken water pipe for a month , got 150 off my rent even though i had to get a hotel twice a week for showers, and eat off disposable plates and utensils because washing dishes with no hot wate is not easy. Im not even sure that the staff means well, the delay on communication is extremely slow, except of course if you are late, which i have never been , or your neighbor whines and complains about everything, then they are on you quick. I am hoping to nuy a house soon so i never ever have to deal with a property management company or landlord again.  I could write a book but i dont have time.<//Text>

Every time I’ve called, I received the information I needed.  Brandon Waters spent a lot of time getting me set up on my account and didn’t make me feel like a LOL.

Both Mikki and Brandon have helped me on different occasions.  Thank you< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I have been renting at lakeside condos about 2 years now and haven’t had any issues until recently. Long story short my work van broke down, sat for about a month, got a letter saying it would be towed, fixed it, got another sticker for expired tags saying they would tow my van if not updated in 96 hours. When I asked for time to get the money to pay I was told rules are rules and they would tow it anyway even though I pay my rent on time every month and have never been late. Even with the pandemic I’ve never been late on rent but don’t have the extra money for tags and asked for 2 weeks to be able to pay them and they said no. Super awful regency absolutely horrible< /review>< Pics>

< review>
My husband and I looked at a house and turned in an application. When I was turning in the application I asked the receptionist at the front desk, Vanessa, if I would get a call to notify me of the decision, whether it be a denial or approval. She indicated that yes they would. She took my $120 for the application fee which was for four people and copies of all necessary documents. I was told 3-5 days to process the application. 5 days go by and haven't heard anything. I call and leave a message since no one answered. No call back after two days. So a week after turning in the application, I call again to speak to someone and again no answer. So I left another message. Never a call back. So they gladly took my money, lied about how they do business and never contacted me. So naturally they rented the house because it was removed but why lie and say they will do something that obviously they don't do. Horrible service in my opinion and I will never attempt to do business with them again. And I will always tell people to not use them because of their horrible service.</review>

Applied for an apartment and they never called and told me the outcome. I had to go down to their “office” to get a response since they
wouldn’t  tell me over the phone. Very unprofessional . Receptionist is rude and snappy. They charge cash for a credit check just to collect money from people and never get back to us.. scam likely DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! #SCAM  also reposting to BBB< /Review>

<text>This agency has rental's that are not up to standards probably up to code also. Not willing to to repairs necessary even refusing to fix or replace things that can put the renters at risk of dangerous injuries nor health risk. Now I know It's up to property owners to do it or I should say "flip the bill". But Regency is the mouthpiece. Example:  you lived in place over 7yrs carpet was bad to begin with, they charge you full replacement of carpet not cleaning. I believe after your there so long you should'nt have to pay for that cause they have to replace anyways.  Or about $7. Per lightbulb in every single room to be replaced. 😱👎<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The HOA sucks. They will fine you real fast but our fence was busted down by a tree branch took them a week to cut the tree and now it's been 3.5 months and my fence is still not fixed. And now someone or something busted down my fence more and popped my swimming pool</text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I moved into my unit in January of 2019 on East normal avenue. the same night someone broke into the unit and stole all my belongings. apparently the windows in the bathroom and the kitchen as well as the front living area where not securely put in place. the company did not want to assist me at all and they gave me a really hard time. As if that wasn't bad enough I realize that they had over charged me $100 for the deposit and I demanded that they return it immediately. I was told by my property manager that I would receive a check but to this day I have still not received my money so that was just outright theft. Additionally my unit was broken into two more times through the window that was supposedly repaired by maintenance, incorrectly. Then I was promised to receive bars for my safety so that my unit could not be broken into again but I am still waiting on the bars to be installed. I have requested that my unit be fumigated three times but still no one has showed up to fumigate my unit. these ladies are very beautiful and sweet when you first go into the office and inquire about a rental property. After you sign on the dotted line they treat you like s***. The ladies do not return phone calls and they frequently lie about everything. They are poorly trained and I believe that there is some racism involved only because I just can't imagine them treating Hispanic people this way. now I feel that I will have to sue them in order to get my deposit back after reading these other reviews. if you take my advice you would stay the hell away from regency property and take your time find a good property management company because these ladies are not someone you want to deal with.< /Review>< Pictures>

I have two Properties being managed by Regency. The owner Brad always has tended to every concern when I've had one. I've only had one particular issue in the last 3 years and that was 3 break in attempt. Right when I got the urgent call I called Regency and Brad himself immediately drove down... on top of that it was 945pm! What company ever responds to late needs on a whim like that! THIS Management company does and to Me that is Exceptional service! Not only does Brad care about his clients and delivering excellent services efficiently, he takes his business seriously. (If you don't pay your rent I'm sorry you will get told to Pay or Leave.) That is anywhere you live. I've owned my properties for 28 years and hiring Regency has made my life a lot easier! Thank you Regency!< /review>

<Text>I have had a great experience renting with Regency. From the time of finding a listing online to addressing minor maintenance issues as they arise, the company has been more than responsive. I was moving back to Fresno and needed to find a place on a limited number of trips, Regency was more than accommodating and assisted with getting everything done electronically. They arranged to allow me to move in out of their normal business hours and followed up the next week to make sure everything was meeting my expectations. On the few occasions I have had to call the office, the team has been helpful, professional, and responsive. I highly recommend renting from Regency.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809467ccb371b557:0xc497ef8c6c209136<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Gmap_id>0x809467ccb371b557:0xc497ef8c6c209136</Gmap_id><review>I have talked with people at Regency over the phone and in person about 20 times over the last month. Overall, many of the people working there are helpful and considerate. Regency will work with people with prior evictions and felony records, which is wonderful and so needed. There is much to appreciate about the organization.

However, my experience has not been good. And I would recommend to avoid Regency if you have any other options. Once in trying to view an apartment, I scheduled it the day before and showed up at 1:30 like we agreed. However, no one came. After calling the office (which their phone system is abysmal), they said, "You didn't answer the call, so it was unconfirmed and no one is coming. Someone will leave now. It will be 7 to 10 minutes." Ten minutes later, I called again, and the receptionist put me on hold, which resulted in being hung up on. I called again and they said, "Oh sorry, that unit won't be available for another month."

I have been told contradictory information multiple times. The employees are often patronizing and try to make you feel dumb for asking questions. Perhaps they are understaffed, which could explain stressed and short responses. Or perhaps the company fails to train employees sufficiently. I don't know. Regardless, my experience overall has not been good and I would not recommend working with Regency, if possible.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Horrible. They don't deal with their HORRIBLE TENANTS. Living next to one of their properties is a nightmare. Countless complaints that they don't follow through on, their tenants have multiple families living in 1 unit with 1 parking space so they take up 5 parking spaces including parking spots to a different property that is NOT OWNED BY REGENCY. They block the only entrance and exit with their vehicles and visitors vehicles, they make gang related threats to other tenants and their visitors.

It’s almost impossible to get a hold off Chrissy, she never returns calls, she never keeps her word. Don’t expect her to do what she said she will do. After she promised something, she disappears and won’t answer your call at all. Every time we would have a problem at our property it would take forever for her to get people to fix it.  Very disappointed with this company.</Review>

<text>Just hired as the property management company for my rental at 7675 N 1st St and it's been a bumpy start. We can't pay rent online yet and it's been extremely tough to get in contact with anyone over the phone. Their hours are 9-5 and they close their doors from Noon-1. Can only get better from here.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Tenants denied access to all pools, even though Fresno county said pools could reopen June 14, 2020. No discounts were given, even though the pools are advertised as an amenity.< /text>

Vanessa is the bestest, she always makes my day. If I have any questions she is Johnny on the spot with answers. Her customer service is the best in the valley, I know this because I work with multiple management companies on the reg.< /review>

<review>horrible customer service. I personally went in to turn in my application. I had a call back for the apartment. After confirmation, I called to set up an appointment. But my application was never found, and no one ever called to give me an update. I was given the run around. It was so frustrating!</review>< Pics>

They are collecting application fees , meaning they hold off on approving someone until a certain quota is made. They will string you along saying the owner needs more info or has other questions they will even go as far as saying worst case scenerio " just pay a double deposit if you have bad credit ,evictions etc etc... Then get a denial letter from Sacramento ... Huge scam be wise people...< /Review>

Great company to work with!!! I called and asked about a property they had for rent they were friendly and took the time to ask me about what I was looking for. Nobody else took the time to do that, and they showed me every property I was interested in. I would definitely recommend them! I only paid 1 credit check fee of 30$ for everything it was well worth it!!!< /Text>

If you have Comcast stay away because Property management will not give permission for Comcast to come out to replace lines to fix cable problems. That means even tho I can pay for gigabit internet from Comcast it drops out constantly everyday.<//text>

They manage a large complex of privately owned condos for the homeowners association. As an owner: I've left 5 messages over 3 days, none returned. Have been hung up on twice while on hold, waiting to speak to my prop. manager or any assistant. Operator says they're having phone problems.  STILL? This level of unresponsiveness is consistent with prior comments over the past year.

From previous comment/review:
"Encourage tenants and the public to keep reporting substandard housing to the city through its FresGo app.   ***“If we don’t receive a complaint, we don’t know about it.”***     The city’s Anti-Slum Enforcement Team, or ASET, tackled 14 that had about 4,200 health and safety violations. That’s more than 450 units with issues like mold, pests, electrical problems, ventilation issues, broken windows and fire damage.   ASET has another 14 properties under investigation, undergoing repairs or waiting for re-inspections. That’s 320 units with 3,700 violations. -Jan.25, 2018<//text>

< Review>
I have never felted so belittled by a property management before. With all my previous landlords, I've always received a refund back from my deposit. This is the first time ever, that I am being requested to pay additional fees for a rental that I clearly cleaned after I moved out. I have pictures to prove that the house I left was in good condition. I even have before pictures of when I moved in too! So you can compare to see the from the "wear and tear," in the three years that I lived there. I should have been granted at lease half my deposit back! Instead, I took them to court and won. They wanted to appeal the case because they said they had other proof. They offered half of my deposit back or to appeal my case and take me back to court. I didn’t want to deal with them again, so unfortunately I took their offer just to rest the case. Lesson learned. Please read your rights and know your laws! This agency will try to fool anyone they can possible get. It’s unfortunate that we live in this kind of society. The rich trying to take from the poor.<//Review>

Very Elegant and Polite Staff. Even though we didn't get approved for the apartment we applied for.
We had very terrible credit and were on the lower side for the income. Which is reasonable.<//review>

When the place was finished we moved in but all the bedrooms smelled of dog urine and they were unwilling to fix this. We had to pay $300 out of pocket to tear them up and even flies were buzzing on them once they were placed outside. Just recently the fence surrounding the house was smashed and broken because one of the "maintenance" workers driving into our driveway and hit it, then claimed that they aren't allowed/not supposed to drive into people's driveways when clearly on 3 separate occasions my family and I have seen them in our driveway. They also were unwilling to fix this. What ever you do don't work with them find someone else please.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Horrible experience was mislead to believe i was approved for a place and after 3 weeks they told me I wasss denied...very UNPROFESSIONAL and shady. The front desk receptionist don't follow the same procedures and policies and the online administration  is a complete fluke..theyre never updating the website so apts u think so available are not, they just haven't removed them off the web and then u end up having to make another selection and risk not being satisfied with what's now available. I heard bad things about them but I'm sorta desperate and crunched for time.. but I see why the reviews are what they are. SMH..just a complete mess and screw up..now I have no clue where I'm moving too and I moving out in the 1st. Way to go Regency...way to go! 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾< /Review>

To date I can't get them to spray my place but they want me to pay rent. What a joke! Exterminator told me that if they scheduled follow up they could eradicate the problem. I'm waiting for them to come by it's been 3.5 months since I called to tell them. Don't rent here or anywhere they manage</Review>

I have used them for about two years now. I thought things went well, but I have a complaint that the front desk did not give receipts when I paid HOA fees for Peachwood.  They will take a check but don't give paperwork to prove payment, forcing me to waste time going to my bank to pull cancelled checks.  Beware programmed property managers.  They also did not allow a home warranty to be used for handyman service on one of my units, insisting on their own screened pros. The seller wasted the money on the deal to me and I lost payment to the pros out of my profit.</Review>

DO NOT RENT FROM REGENCY. This place has terrible service. The employees here are always rude and give false information so they can steal your money. They tried to move me into an apartment that had a broken fence, broken windows, walls that were about to cave in, and INFESTED with roaches. This was the case for both places I got accepted for.  They don't ever make repairs and take forever to get back to you when you have a problem with your unit.<//review>

I'm very upset I live in the Summerset Village Apartment I called him twice and goes straight to voicemail they say they are open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and closed from 12 to 1 for lunch it is 2:09 right now and nobody's picking up the phone I call you guys the Regency owner of Summerset and all I get is a voicemail to call the operator over and over again nobody freaking picks up I'm very irritated my water is turned off and it has been turned off for 20 minutes now I had no notice that the water was going to be turned off and I'm in the middle of cooking I am very upset that I have no water to clean my food and cook my meal you guys are very unprofessional.<//text>

<Text>This place is horrible and that is short for this property management place. Be worm!!!they are only friendly at first. But once you rent and sign that contract the staff is rude, disrespectful, and have no manners. They never get repairs done right because they do not want to pay  the full price to get repairs done right. Stay away!! We experienced it first hand. We rented for a year never late on our rent.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I'm so glad I'm not renting from this place. I sent an email about an available property and got a prompt call back. I didn't get the name of the person who called, but she scheduled three appointments for me on the same day. I got to the first place right on time but no one was there to show it to me. I waited 20 minutes, then called the number that had called me and a woman answered. I told her who I was and where I was. She mumbled something about seeing who was supposed to be there and hung up. I waited another 25 minutes before deciding I wasn't going to deal with this company anymore. If this is how you treat people who are trying to rent with you I can only imagine how you treat actual residents.<//Text>

Encourage tenants and the public to keep reporting substandard housing to the city through its FresGo app.   ***“If we don’t receive a complaint, we don’t know about it.”***     The city’s Anti-Slum Enforcement Team, or ASET, tackled 14 that had about 4,200 health and safety violations. That’s more than 450 units with issues like mold, pests, electrical problems, ventilation issues, broken windows and fire damage.   ASET has another 14 properties under investigation, undergoing repairs or waiting for re-inspections. That’s 320 units with 3,700 violations. -Jan.25, 2018<//review>

Horrible experience with this property management. They are what you call "slumlords!" If you don't know what a slumlord is, please google it, because Regenecy Management Property located at 331 W. Shields is the definition of a slumlord. They are only nice at first, (before business) after they get your business, (prepare to put a fight for everything)! They are money hungry, and that is their priority. They don't know what customer services is.< /review>

This company made me feel as if they could help me with a brand-new life when I started renting with them 5years ago, but this year I am homeless, boarded out of my 1st place. 3days before Christmas, and in court behind, incomprehensable, unethical, poorly educated staff members,( whom I'll do the FAVOR of not mentioning your name this time). From my overpayed deposit, to overpaying the rent, no renewed lease to Pushing unlawful detainer paperwork against me only AFTER accepting my Credit check for another apartment. Thanks he ride has been unreal, but a learning experience none the less. Good riddance to bad garbage. This company is a headache beyond them all. I'm sad to leave the decent members of this company. But the newly hired apple polishers will run outta gas and be in my position in little to no time. You'll be an invite to the company party this year, to the same mfers who will surely pass your ass up at the bus stop on their way to work like they never knew you...promise XoMEoX< /text>

<review>I've only lived at one of their properties for a few short months and their follow up is unreasonably poor. They lack common customer service skills as well as basic privacy standard. I addressed a privacy concern via email to one of their supervisors Adam and never received a follow up. Taylor is my property supervisor and is aggravatingly difficult to get a hold of. If you want feedback on anything you have to make multiple attempts to contact her to get a response. The ladies at the front desk are very sweet and helpful but only so much they can help with when it the "supervisors" responsibility to follow up with issues at their assigned properties. I work for a property management myself and understand that things get hectic and unexpectedly come up but their disregard for follow up is not an ideal trait for a company I want to continue tenancy with. The house I rent from is beautiful and has been recently remodeled which is the only reason I intent on continuing my lease with them otherwise I'd much prefer to pay rent to someone who appreciates my business.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

If I could give them a zero I would I never recvd my last months rent and they put in a dishwasher that I never approved of. They intimdated me to give back pet deposit when they had two dogs and I only approved for one and the dogs peed on the carpet all over. Of course I should have never let them imtimidate me it was a good learning lesson.< /review>

They don't upgrade properties to be immaculate(perfectly clean or brand new) before you move in and then they want to upgrade things and charge you for items that were worn or dull/broken when you move out. They charge you for anything and everything they possibly can. The sliding door we had barely would open, you had to give it a real push to open it, the windows didnt have locks on them, the towell rack and toilet paper rolls were stripped and looked like they had been redone more than once before we moved in so they werent very stable. The screen door would stick. My husband and i didnt pay much attention because it wasn't a big deal and it wasn't our house. They charged us for all those things and then overcharged a crazy amount to do simple things like painting and cleaning. Which i had scrubbed the place before we left. We had a 1000$ deposit and they charged us 1600$ for all for that stuff. So supposedly we owe 600$ even after our deposit!! Ridiculous. On top of that, the managers never return your calls. We had to call several times and would get sent to voicemail and never have our calls returned or voicemails answered. Worst mistake, not researching your rental property management group!!< /review>< user_id>

Disgusted with this company i truly dont know how what they do is even legal. I paid a 1000$ deposit to move in 2 weeks after i move out i get an estimate on how much i will get back well turns out i actually owe 550$ they spent 1550$ on "repairs and maintance" for things that were already messed up when we moved in! I see people on here with the same issie taking them to court and i want to warn people to stay away i have never felt this robbed in my life! They gave me an estimate 2 weeks after i moved out which was on January 6th. I just now got the actual bill today after weeks and weeks of calling to find out what it is im getting back! It is now February 23rd and im still fighting with them please find a better place to rent from.< /review>

Called this place many times all day, they kept putting me on HOLD. OVER AND OVER. No one helped me. I applied and was calling to check up on my application only to be ignored. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.</text>

<Text>Poor follow up with property issues. It took months before we got a reply for maintainance issues. The only time anything was fixed was when the renew on the lease was due. Once we signed the lease, all maintainance stopped.I woud not recommend doing business with this company.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809467ccb371b557:0xc497ef8c6c209136</gmap_id></record>

They have the worst customer service I spoke with a women who sets up the appointments to view homes and she had the worst attitude. She didn't sound polite nor happy about her job. If you don't like your job get a new one!!!!  This company is just bad.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) In my experience
I do not recommend renting with this company after they leave you an hour on the line and they only tell you to wait, it has taken more than five days to send someone to check the sink in my kitchen, which was covered and the water was returning. drainage
For them that is not an emergency since it took five days for them to send someone

At first they are very friendly but later they do not answer calls or e-mails and they do not care about the repairs or maintenance of the properties
They only care about the rent money because in the two and a half years that I have been with them I have never paid my rent late
If they have enough staff to collect the rent checks but they don't have enough staff to maintain the properties when you really need them
Very bad service for my taste

En mi experiencia
No recomiendo rentar con esta compañía después de que te dejan una hora en la línea y solamente te dicen que esperes esperes se han tardado más de cinco días en mandar a alguien a revisar el sink de mi cocina el cual estaba tapado y estaba regresándose el agua del drenaje
Para ellos eso no es una emergencia ya que tardaron cinco días en poder mandar a alguien

Al principio si son muy amables pero ya después no contestan llamadas ni tampoco los e-mails y no les importa la reparaciones ni mantenimiento de las propiedades
Solo les importa el dinero de la renta ya que en los dos años y medio que llevo con ellos nunca he pagado mi renta tarde
Si tienen personal suficiente para cobrar los cheques de la renta pero no tienen personal suficiente para darle mantenimiento a las propiedades cuando uno los necesita realmente
Muy mal servicio para mi gusto< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>
