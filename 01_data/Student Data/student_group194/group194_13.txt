True pros, the service was truly outstanding. You can order any tire and they will match online prices. Or you can buy your set, ship it there and they will install it. Alignment with the latest laser technology: very precise and fast. Thank you 5 Day! While you wait, you can walk to Prospect Coffee and treat yourself.<//Text>

I've been having trouble finding a shop that will align my lifted 98 Jeep Wrangler TJ being as it has aftermarket fully adjustable upper and lower control arms and track bars.

These guys did a full front a rear alignment and fixed my caster angle. Jeep drives great now definitely reccomend if you have a 4x4 or something modified they'll figure out how to get it driving straight.< /Review>

Excellent place to go for a set of tires and pretty much everything tire related. Super friendly and helpful, with a great selection of tires, along with impressive pricing. They are also able to order tires if they dont have the specific ones you want in stock at the time.

Got a full set of nice (Pirelli) new tires for my car here, along with a 4 wheel alignment. I didn't need to break the bank to do so as well.

If you are interested in a new set of tires, a phone call or an email is a great way to get an estimate. I shopped around, and the guys at 5 day are hard to beat.</Review>

I've used these guys multiple times now.  Always friendly, and helpful.  Great quick service and very trustworthy.  If you don't need something, they won't try to sell you on it.  I was expecting to need to change a tire when I got a piece of metal in my tire.  Instead, the tire was taken off and examined.  They found that it just needs a patch(which was done properly) and I was on my way in 10 minutes!  I highly recommend them and they are the very convenient downtown area.< /Review>

Had puncture repaired for free under store service plan.  Came in late in day but they jumped on it immediately.

Have bought tires nowhere else since my family discovered this family-owned little store 20 years ago.  Best combination of value and service.</review>

<text>I'm so pleased to have found this place. It's a family owned business that has been there for I think 38 years, and it shows. They are kind, helpful, and know their stuff. What a pleasant experience, and great service. I had all four tires replaced, and they will now rotate my tires for free every 5,000 miles. I got the guarantee from them, so when a week later I got a screw in one of my new tires, I brought it by and they fixed it for free. Another thing I appreciate is that they are realistic and honest about the time it will take to get the work done, so I can plan accordingly, and not sit around waiting like I have with other auto service places. By the way, very reasonable and quick turn around time on the work as well. All around, warm hearted, great work, and honest. This is now my tire place for good. Highly recommend. The kind of place that I feel good about supporting.</text>< Pictures>

I had a really great experience at 5 Day Tire Store.  I went in to get my alignment fixed after reading all the great reviews on this place.  After inspecting the car, they told me I needed to replace my two front tires due to the poor alignment, which I wasn't expecting to have to do.  However, the owner Alex gave me a great deal on the replacement tires!  My alignment feels so much better now as well.  Besides the excellent service and reasonable prices, the owners are what really makes this place great!  Highly recommended!</review>

I have been to this shop 2x now and both times I have been greeted with impeccable service and time frames for completion that go above my expectations. Prices are very reasonable and my tires come with free rotation when needed.

They have done all 4 tires for me and preformed my alignment and balance. My truck is driving great. I am so happy I took the chance and called 5 day tire.</text>

<Review>Love, love ,love coming here because I feel like I'm getting treated well. Once many years ago my husband got tires at Tire Pros which was a disaster since they put three tires of one type and a third of a different size. Once we discovered 5 Day Tire, it was such a relief to fine a reputable business. I wouldn't trust anyone else! I refer anyone who asks me for a recommendation for a tire company. Thank goodness for 5 Day Tire!< /Review>< GmapID>

<review>I went to 5 Day Tire Store for replacement of front tires on my Lexus in addition to brake pads replacement.  I'll tell you how honest this shop and the owner, Andres, are.  After inspecting the brake pads, Andres informed me that the pads are still in good condition and do not need immediate replacement. I was willing to pay for the new pads, but Andres was honest enough to do what's best for me and my car and not out there to make a quick buck.  This honesty has certainly earned my business for a long time, not to mention referrals to my family and friends.
As a side note, Andre's dad (original shop owner) came in and was shooting the breeze with all the customers and made all of us feel comfortable doing business with his shop.
I highly recommend 5 Day Tire Store to anyone who needs tire, brakes, and probably suspension work performed on their cars.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
I have had 3 very positive experiences with 5 Day Tires.  First - had to get tires for my commuter car (that had been in my driveway for a while) and they hooked me up with good value on two tires, talked me out of four that I may have gone for.  Second - repaired one of my "old" tires a few months later that had a nail in it at no cost as they also took a look at brake work that I needed.  Third - stood by their brake work quote even though it was a few months later after some heavy driving.  Will be going back for new tires on my Toyota SUV soon and any other car I may have.  Great experience!< /review>

So unprofessional, it was like an episode of Seinfeld. I ordered a pair of tires from them on Tuesday in preparation for a Saturday appointment. I show up for my appointment and they are like "whoops!" Not even a sorry for wasting my time. There are better tire places.<//Text>

Outstanding!  Best tire replacement I have ever experienced.  After this experience, we will only ever go to 5 Day Tire Stores in Ventura for a new tires.  Price was excellent.  Service was gold star.  The staff were super friendly and went out of their way to make the wait comfortable.  It doesn't get better than this.

<Review>A little story to the review:
I had gone to America's Tire Pro earlier today for 2 new tires only to have them call me stating it was crucial to get a third new tire... they told me my spare was unusable and I would have to spend another $115.
Being an independent student who works two jobs just to get by, I was in no way prepared to buy from them again.
I found Avenue and 5-Day Tire here on Google.
Called Avenue first and got a very short abrupt uninterested response. I then called 5-Day and IMMEDIATELY received better customer service within the first 'hello'.
Alex was the sweetest and most helpful and had me come right in. Once I got there, he knew exactly who I was and went straight to check out my tires. After looking for a minute, he said I could use my spare, get a matching tire for it AND I would still have a spare just in case all for $50. They are more than friendly and have helped me out more than I could imagine. Moral of the story: I should have bought all 3 tires here from the start. THANK YOU ALEX AND EDGAR</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I've been to several different places from Ventura to Oak View for work on my truck in the past and 5 day tires provided the best customer service and prices by far. No nonsense, just a very sincere and thorough business. Highly recommended.</Review>

Not the best first experience at Dunkin Donuts. The store was nice, clean, and plenty of seating. I gave 2 stars bc there were only 2 people staffed on Saturday morning. The second employee showed up just as we walked in, put her hair up, put on gloves and started working. She didn’t wash her hands. Hygiene is very important when food handling. Maybe just emphasize that a little more. Regardless the donuts were ok, the tea was good, not many iced tea options, and the sandwiches were actually the best part. They have the usual egg, bacon, or sausage(I can’t remember if they had ham) and different bread options. They’re not that greasy which is why they are good lol. The prices are reasonable too, cheaper than sbux.<//text>

The asian guy kinda overcooks the bagel, and not enough cream cheese. Also their coffee is the worse. Other than that neat n clean place to eat. Don’t forget to try jelly filled dough nut<//review>

Yikes. Outlets literally all across the walls of the entire place, and none of them work... They're clearly there for customers as they have built-in USB ports for cellphone charging. The employees weren't the nicest either... Had a good latte, I guess.<//Review>

Not bad donuts as far as donuts go but love their excellent croissant s and coffee . nice little shop good service but I HATE seeing them throw away trays full of fresh donuts into the trsdh no excuse what so ever when they can simply donate them to a homeless or  domestic violence  shelter or a soup kitchen. Too many going hungry in cities everywhere to justify waste at that level 9</review>

<Text>I'm from Connecticut. This was my first Dunkin I seen while visiting family in California. They had no idea what we were talking about when we said things like " light and sweet" and everything was wrong..I heard it's a newer shop so I tried to be fair with my rating. I'm a Dunkin addict. I go twice a day in Connecticut ( there's one on every corner)  and these people just seemed to be lost when it came to making drinks. Very friendly staff though.</Text><Date>1515093554553< /Date><userid>107916366813416292947< /userid>< Resp>

Clean, good service, donuts are very unmemorable. Coffee is predictable murican drip. Normally I don't care about this, but I'm taking a star off because they are playing really really horrible music. 4 on the floor dance music is NOT coffee music. I am fairly certain they're doing this to force people not to do work in here. So if you want better coffee and to buy local, go to Finns down the street. For cheaper better local donuts, go to Ferrell's across the street. For a working environment, go to Starbucks also down the street. But I do like the drip coffee here more than Charbucks.<//review>

Went to grab a snack at 5:15pm and they were closed. A the lights were on and the hours say they are open until 10pm but no employees were inside and the doors were locked. They had a wet floor sighn out for patrons and had clearly just moped but again, doors locked and no one inside. 🤔< /Text>

Ugh. Don’t bother. Pickings are surprisingly slim and quality is just not there. Head across the street to Ferrell’s instead. You’ll thank me.<//text>

the coffee is good. And some of the breakfast sandwiches... But the donuts really aren't that great, and the service is terrible. I was there for an hour and a half and they were never able to give anyone napkins.</text>

<text>Clean and uncomfortably uncommon. Very strange layout. While standing in line I had a chance to check out the prices of the doughnuts......... When did Dunkin' Doughnuts start adding gold and silver to their doughnuts? I'm from the East coast where there is a Dunkin on every corner. But they never cost almost $2.00 a doughnut. I got along without Dunkin for over five years and at that price I'll do without for another five. Very dissappointing 😔😕 They are good doughnuts but not that good.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Inside has penty of seating, a very open feel, high ceilings and well lit due to large windows. Alit was daytime when I visited but, I can imagine the lighting to be on par once the Earth's rotation moves our respective  horizon p for the night).</text>< pictures>

Worst donut place ever. Can't open on time-the posted hours are 5 am and they make that about once a week. Small parking, lot slow service, no wifi (no really) although you can poach the guest  access from the retail store next door, practically no inside seating.....there is no reason to hit this place up really.</Review>

The manager was rude and argued with me about my order she told me that I needed to make sure the cashier new next time and not to be difficult I told the cashier my order correctly in the first place he apologized as well as the other young man that was working there I apologize profusely for her rudeness and her poor conduct as a boss I go to Dunkin Donuts everyday at home everyday I spend 40 $50 a week at a Dunkin Donuts to have a woman be rude to me it's ridiculous I cannot wait to get back to Tennessee where we have what you call Southern Charm and hospitality people around here just rude  even made my coffee wrong<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The donuts as usual are deliciously delicious, the service at this branch was particularly poor.

A month later needed some addtional pieces, they called the sister place on Rodeo (apparently no longer a part of the business), found they had what I needed to complete the project, about 500 lbs worth, picked it up.  All was good.  Am going to try again this month, need about 1500 lb worth, somewhat wary based on recent reviews, will report back.<//review>< Pictures>

Right next to the 405 these guys are pretty awesome and just chucking everything from sand to pavers into your truck with gusto. Pretty good price for the average home improvement person with b level knowledge. The guys are really nice and you only have to duck passing jets every 3 minutes.<//Text>

To start I had a bad experience with these store I have been buying them materials since 2000 the owner and the employees were helpful and friendly but now in the store is a guy who says is he’s son and he took his place on the store and in multiple times I have some issues with him and once he took me out of the store because I told him that he was charging me more than I bought he stared saying that was his store and he can do whatever he wants and many more bad words and he told me that he didn’t want to see me again buying is his store  in my opinion he is so disrespectful to the costumers.... honestly I don’t recommend this store<//Text>

Good inventory of masonry, stone, sand, gravel and concrete construction materials.  Somewhat small, confined yard. Fair priceing and convenient if you needing materials.</review>

< Review>
We (my nieces and I) got in line outside around 5:30 pm.  Mind you it was freakin hot!  Little did we know it was going to close soon.  The sales gal came out and told us that we are not guaranteed to come in since they were closing.  It was 3 mins till 6.  Did we have a choice?  Instead of giving us this BS rule, they could have accommodated the people that were in line already.  Took our business to Tilly's.  Sorry but not sorry.</Review>

<Review>I will NEVER go back. I was there to get sweatpants for my little sister and ended up not getting them because when we first walked in I didn’t get greeted or anything, I felt uncomfortable there with the employees. The “manager” Mia, shouldn’t even be a manager. She was very rude. Didn’t smile, didn’t talk. Stared at me and gave me dirty looks. It was my first time going to the Santa Barbara location and it was the worst experience ever! I walked out with no purchase. Don’t go there. It’s worth the drive to go out of town to a different location.< /Review>< Pics>

Every single time I've walked in here, I've never been greeted or offered any help, even if I'm the ONLY customer in the store. I am either straight up ignored and make my way around the store in silence, or the girls at the register are too busy gossiping to grace me with the gift of their attention. Yet numerous times, as soon as another girl walks in who is blonde/Caucasian, they are immediately greeted with a smile and the store employees trip over each other trying to offer their help. I've never experienced blatant discrimination like this in a store and will not be returning to be treated this way again.</Review>< gmapID>

Super cute clothes perfect for petite small girls as it it geered more for them. Small but cozy. I would give 5 stars if the staff hadn't been chatting behind the counter one girl did say hi and smiled but the others were chatting and took forever to finally charge us.< /Text>

The staffs were the rudiest staffs that I've ever seen. They did not greet me and my friend when we first walked in, and the staffs were all chatting with each other. When we were picking up clothes that we wanna try, they gave us those gazes like we were not supposed to touch it with our dirty hands. Only been there twice and I'm sure I would never wanna go in again.< /Review>

The service was decent, but it was a bit busy. I've never found pants that were so tomboy, chill and sexy looking at the same time & perfect for skating, my butt looks so fly in all of them<3 literally spending my all my Xmas money on their clothes.< /Text>

I used to go to this store a lot when I was in France and was excited when I found out they were opening one here in Santa Barbara. The clothes are really nice but the customer service is HORRIBLE! The employees don't do much except gossip at the counter. My sister and I have been there twice and each time they've treated us pretty rudely compared to the white customers. They'll stare at us when we walk around and one even followed us around, they wouldn't let us bring our bags into the dressing room and when the line was long we decided to go in one fitting room together but they wouldn't let us (even though the other two fitting rooms had 2-3 girls in them too). They didn't change their attitudes until they saw that we were going to actually buy something. It's really a shame since I like that store but they just the give the whole store a bad vibe.< /Review>

They advertise free tune ups for life.  I bought a nice bike for my son and 4 years later take it in for a tune up.  They told me they lost my data and I'd have to pay 55 dollars.  I paid the money and communicated my displeasure and asked for a simple apology. I was told the words I'm sorry wouldn't be said.  I promised I'd leave them a bad review if I couldn't at least get the words I'm sorry.  They told me to go ahead,  so here I am.  I'll not be giving them any business or recommendations in the future.<//Review>

< Review>
Bought my first carbon frame and I was lucky to find the owner of this fine establishment selling is practically new 10 speed groupset. He helped me build my first real race bike even if it doesn't have the newest components  nor disc brakes it makes me feel good about getting out there and just trying to get as fast as I can but do it safely I'll he paying my thanks personally to Aaron for the service🤟🏼💪🏽 ride on</Review>

This place is the worst people i went there today had a easy fix on repair on my bike i waited outside for 10 minutes to be told they where backed up on repairs for 3 weeks. So i was loading my bike up in my truck so then another person came up with a bike and he was let right in. Perfect example of racial discrimination me being covered in tattoos and told to go away. Bad customer service people.< /text>

First time here, they were very helpful with answering all my dumb questions.  Definitely will be back, they seem to really know their stuff. They have lots of parts and can make repairs in store.</Review>

<Review>The service is fast and professional. There was a small problem when I got my bike back: after a day of riding my newly tuned bike, the wheel was flat the next morning; there was no puncture on the outside. When I brought it in, they were willing to cover most of the price, taking the blame for the flat. Most professional place in the area.
Edit: They didn't admit to making the mistake, but rather they took responsibility for the incident.</Review>< username>

I recently bought a Sea Wind bicycle from here and the store is amazing! The staff (Aaron in particular) gave great service, unlike a store I went to in Lakewood made me not want to come back! Bellflower Bicycles is different (in good way). I will recommend this store to all my friends make sure they come check the store out. Aaron wasn't pushy and the customer service is commendable and very impressive!

Thanks Bellflower Bicycles!!!!!!! :)< /text>

<text>You can expect a professional, knowledgeable and informative experience. Spoke with Aaron a couple days was nothing less than welcoming, open to my ideas and took the time to discuss 2019 #sebikes . Went in and met Jeff, he was equally friendly and took care of everything I bounced off him. Definitely recommend this shop, my bike needs and fellowship are here! Thanks Bellflower Bicycles!</text></record>

Fair and upfront prices, honest salesmen, conveniently located. They did a great service to my brother-in-law's bike after another shop ripped him off and ruined his bike. We walked in right at closing and they still took the time to talk to us and get his bike checked in for repair. It was done on time and with no issues. He is happy, my wife is happy, I am happy. We're all happy! Yay!!!</Text>

<text>This is the absolute WORST bike shop in the area, I am a seasoned bmx rider and have came there  multipule times for fixes and parts and they always give me the wrong parts, don’t put stuff on right, and charge a fortune.  Anyone who says against this hasn’t been to franks bicycles down the street, he is a awesome person, charges right, gives you the right stuff, AND DOESN’T CUT CORNERS!!< /text><Response>None< /Response><Rate>1< /Rate>< Name>

I’m afraid of the dentist. Did my research and found her. Excellent care and service. Staff is caring and thoughtful. Everyone is professional. Office in Marina 94123. I am extremely happy I’ve found a dentist taking care of all my dental needs. Prices very affordable. Location centralized.</Text>

< Review>
I'm a huge fan of Smile SF!

Dr. Farah Sefidvash has been my dentist for 6 years now and I have absolutely nothing but praises for her and her team. She has a keen eye for details when it comes to oral health. I trust her and all of her dental hygienists fully. Apart from Dr. Sefidvash being a truly skilled dentist, she is kind and always makes time to connect on a personal level which feels so comforting in life but especially at the dentist's office.

The office inside is well styled and always clean—professionalism that provides a sense of assurance. The location is beautiful with a glimpse of the Bay on your commute there. I actually moved further away to Bernal Heights but I still come to Smile SF because I love the community and I feel at home every time I visit!

I couldn't suggest a better dentist.< /Review>

My dentist for +5 years! Nothing to complain about .
Dr Farah Sefidvash is so friendly and good at what she does. My mouth has been healthy (she regularly does all sorts of checks, e.g. cancer checks, x-rays, looking for cavities...), and my teeth are white & clean. She explains everything clearly, and is very attentive.
What I also love about Smile SF: the location (I usually combine my appointment with brunch or shopping in the neighborhood), and it's an all women team! :)</review>

Long Covid and infection burst a tooth. During the pandemic, many dentists were closed, but SmileSF was taking patients and had good reviews. The diagnosis was to address a variety of issues to give me the best chance of success with a crown on the broken tooth: Gum treatment was needed to clear infection, home care would be required to heal the gums. Next, the broken tooth was flanked by two teeth with old fillings, so those fillings were ready to be replaced, and the best time to do it would be during the clean out and installation of the new crown. I could understand it would be dicey dealing with either of those fillings later. So over the last 6 weeks I've had all this work done. The bonus is that my Long Covid episodes (which had escalated during the few weeks before my tooth burst) have subsided a great deal. Causation or correlation? Who knows? Long Covid is a mystery at this point. But many of us who had Covid-19 are having a variety of dental problems. SmileSF is practicing good protocols to keep them and we safe from re-infection. If you are cohort 2 (as I am) and episodes are increasing, checking for infection of your gums and teeth might be worthwhile. This office is struggling a bit with the Pandemic protocols, as everyone is. But they are fully equipped and careful. I would recommend Dr. Farah Sefidvash.< /text>

Dr. Farah is very competent, the office staff is very friendly and the facilities are quite modern.  I had a root canal today and  think I actually slept  through part of it.  She is thorough and explained everything in detail.  Prior to any treatment you will know exactly what is going to happen and the charges.  Highly recommended.  I am going back tomorrow for a cleaning and will let you know how it goes.< /Text>

<review>I came to Doctor  Sefidvash for cleaning. After extensive consultation she recommended that I should get a crown and a filling. The process took multiple visits. The experience was painless. I love my new tooth. No issues or sensitivity.  She is a great dentist and I highly recommend her work.</review></record>

I always have a very positive experience at Dr. Farah's office.  Her staff is always prompt, courteous and highly professional.  I am a long time patient of Dr. Farah since 2002 and have had extensive necessary dental work performed by her over the years, including a 2-3 yr Invisalign process and bridge, and also various crown work which has always been more than satisfactory to me.  Dr. Farah is always professional and caring, and she  explains all the procedures and treatment required in lots of detail including a written treatment plan and cost estimate.  But even more importantly, she is very gentle and genuinely concerned about patient comfort.  I actually look forward to seeing my dentist regularly!< /Review>

I've been seeing Dr. Farah for about 17 years and recommend her highly.  When I first started seeing her, her practice was called "Gentle Dental Care", and that's what I was looking for and received at a high quality level.  I've been impressed how Dr. Farah is able to handle well and confidently situations during dental procedures that earlier dentists found challenging. She does a good job communicating exactly what is happening, and seems exceptionally well in tune with maintaining patient comfort through procedures.< /Review>

I’ve been going to Dr. Farah for 15 years, and she is amazing!  I’m so comfortable in her chair that I often fall asleep; from pure comfort.

She’s very personable and her goal is to take care of your teeth, and make you comfortable at the same time.

I would recommend Dr. Farah to anyone!</text>

Simply put, Farah Sefidvash and her staff lack integrity, honesty and competence when it comes to dentistry. Here is my experience in simple bullet points (please note that I visited Farah Sefidvash after 4 months of my previous dental cleanup in Houston, my old hometown. I take very good care of my teeth, floss and brush per dentists' recommendations, and never had a cavity):

*dental hygienist claimed that I needed deep cleaning for most of my teeth, and I knew that was false.
*dental hygienist was aggressive and hurried in her cleaning.
*dental hygienist kept making awkward jokes that left me very uncomfortable

*X-ray technician took what must have been over 20 x-ray images of my teeth, which subsequently led me to ask her to stop since I was a few more snaps away from getting oral cancer.
*Reason for taking all these x-rays is because she did not have experience and kept messing up

* "Dr" Farah Sefidvash could not care less about the x-rays that were presented to her on the screen. She got called away half through my examination and never came back.

*I spent over 2 and a half hours at the clinic for a simple cleanup that should have taken less than 1 hour.

I've lived in many places around the US. Some of the dentists that I came across were OK, some great. I've never had such a regretful experience with dentists until Farah Sefidvash came up on my search engine. I should have read more closely into the bad reviews out there. Lesson learnt.</review>

I love my dentist! I had a dental emergency quite a few years ago, and happened to see her ad in that week's Bay Guardian. The Bay Guardian has disappeared, but thankfully Dr. Farah is still around ... and still working miracles. I owe my smile to her.

She takes a kind, non-hysterical approach when making recommendations, and there's always a gentle, clean precision to her work. I have NEVER felt any pain — not before, during, or after ... and that includes extractions, root canals, and crowns. The office staff is great, the rooms are clean and inviting, and her prices are fair.

When I tried to post a review of Dr. Farah on Yelp, they ended up burying what I'd posted ... maybe they couldn't believe a dentist could be this great.<//Review>

Her staff is lovely and the office is in a great location in the Marina. A UC grad all the way with great credentials.</Review>

I've been going to Dr. Farah for over 10 years now, and there's a reason I'm a long time client; because she's simply wonderful.  She takes time to explain diagnosis, prognosis, and everything in between.  Her staff is wonderful, and always very pleasant.  I hope to continue seeing Dr. Farah for another 10 years</review>

<text>My experience was very traumatic. Dr. Farah Sefidvash destroyed my front tooth number 10 and ruined my smile. I went to her to do a simple procedure changing the color of my tooth's small filling to make my smile look whiter. Dr. Farah ended destroying my tooth by changing the length and shape. She was nice and asked me to go back to her that she will fix her mistake but unfortunately for me after I trusted her more than 5 times and gave her the opportunity to fix her mistakes I ended with a weak and broken tooth. After this horrendous experience I visited another dentist to get some help and she couldn't believe the huge size of the filling I had on my number 10 tooth.
Now I need a crown which will cost me $1500 because the tooth will always break out and also may need a root canal because of the extreme sensitivity she left after working so many times on the same tooth.
If you are looking for a good dentist which you can trust that will take care of your smile. She is not the one!</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Best dentist, hands down, in my, ahem, vast experience (father was a dentist and I worked in a dental lab).  If you want to keep your teeth, Dr. Farah is your dentist.  She discusses with you your long term goals for keeping your mouth healthy.  THEN she sticks to the plan.

Is she painless?

I fell asleep in the chair during the procedure after (she told me) she had to do a root canal.  Local anesthesia.  She wound up NOT doing the canal, because she is conservative, and considerate of my wishes even if I am out cold.  You can trust her to save salvageable teeth even if you are out cold..<//Text>< pictures>

Farah's office had a deal on Invisalign a while back and after lots of research I felt like her office was closest to me and had the best deal.  She didn't have any patient reviews which is what made me a little nervous about the whole thing but i'm glad I decided to give her a try anyway.

Everything went very well!  Farah and her team made sure to explain the whole process in detail to me before I signed up.  They also took the time to answer any questions I had during my treatment.  The whole thing took less than a year because of the type of fixes I needed (time may vary depending on your teeth).  I had a protruding tooth which was my reason behind the whole thing but learned that a lot of my teeth weren't straight.  The appointments were always very quick check ups and now I have very straight teeth!  Everyone notices and compliments my smile!  If you're thinking about Invisalign it's pretty amazing!  No one noticed I had the treys on my teeth or the "buttons" that keep the treys in place.  It was an easy experience and HIGHLY recommend getting the treatment with Farah and her team!<//Review>

I saw Dr. Farah's ad regarding Invisalign and checked her out.  I instantly knew she is an expert and decided on the spot to go with her.  It has been 10 months and I am extremely happy with the results.  My teeth were on the move out and they are now back where they should be and straight!  Dr. Farah is clearly concerned with her patients' satisfaction.  I highly recommend her and will continue to see her after my Invisalign is complete.  (She is an expert in the Botox dept. as well!)

I got great savings compared to my previous company and she was very thorough with explaining the different types of coverage. Super grateful & happy Michelle answered my call and invited me to the Mack road location so I could get the coverage I needed at an affordable rate🦊 Thanks again Jazmin!< /Text>< gmap_id>

The young girl @ front desk is the only reason why I give this place a 5 stars.  She understands good customer service and very helpful.  Other staff is very rude and only helpful to people they are familiar with.< /Review>

This insurance place is very people friendly! Customer service here is on point and everyone here is cheerful and polite. I did not have to wait more thank a few minutes for help but upon walking in I was quickly greeted and offered a drink. I also have to say that Kristina and Mgr. Lucia was really helpful and knowledgeable in helping me with understanding not only my rates but what my policy detailed and covered. I am also impressed by the patience that everyone posses to help with some of the challenging questions that may come up. I would recommend this place hands down to anyone and it definitely worth it! Thanks again for your awesome service. KRISTINA IS AWESOME!!!!!</review>

<review>Lucia Medina was such a huge help! I was having financial trouble and she was so patient with me, and helped me on three separate occasions to ensure I left worry-free and satisfied with my visits. I stopped going to the cost u less across the street from my house and switched to the one 4 miles away just because of how well taken care of I've been in my recent visits. Thank you guys so much!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The employees and the owners are very friendly and accommodating. Though their commodities are limited at this time, we can find most of the basic needs. Another plus is that this store is cheaper than it's counterpart.< /Review>

<review>The store is under new management and new owners who, are way much friendlier and great customer service. So far, so good. Hoping that they will exceed the quality of service by the previous owner. I like it that they resumed cleaning fishes if requested and fry them for you for a minimal fee.< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>Under new management, still to early to review. But, so far the take out restaurant has been greatly improved and store is heading in the right direction 😊.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x8094c0a2240bc237:0xa644ff478f3d47e5<//Gmap_id><userid>101210082306661569188</userid>< user_name>

If you want authentic Filipino cuisine, you have to visit this place! The food is superb and the employees are very welcoming! I feel sorry for my wallet, as this is a place I'm gonna be visiting often!</Text>

< Review>
A great variety of authentic Filipino food. Stuff I haven't had since childhood. And they just don't look good but also taste awesome! And everybody is very friendly and welcoming , which is why I stopped going to zenny's. That old man and woman at Jenny"s are very unwelcoming and very rude. Unless your part of their circle.<//Review>

Wish i could give negative stars. When you walk in they look at you like you dont belong, and when you say hello they dont respond. Very racist! NEVER going back there.</review>

No one asked me if I needed anything when I stood in front of the hot deli. Then when I tried to buy my tea I had no idea you couldn't use card under 10 dollar purchases. The guy behind the counter who already had no customer service good attitude, I mean at least fake that your happy I walked in to buy something. Anyways, he just looked at me all weird and said you don't have cash. Ummm If I did don't you think I wouldn't have been holding my card in my hand. Never going back that's for sure. Rude as hell< /Review>

Shrimp paste smell greet you, not Asian grocery store, more like 90% Filipino ingredients that Chinese Japanese Korean don't know what to do with. Good if you grow up with Filipino food, I am not a fan of fried pork skin nor the taste.</Text>

They serve food here but do not have access to fresh veggies daily ?
No beansprouts ? No mint ? No basil ?
Basic things you can get at savemart, save yourself a trip. Savemart carries most of the items you want, and more.</text>

Newly opened areas for foot tragic flow; gives this place a welcomed new  feel!  Sunday's only 9am 5pm

No parking. Parking lot was full. If you can find one, street parking available.

Admission...$5

The line to get in was long. However, the line moved quickly and we were in!

100 +  friendly vendors offering you the best deal they can.

Live DJ Killing it!
And Various Music playing here and there as you stroll looking for those sleepers (hidden treasure)!

Shady areas to relax/ post.

Delicious Food trucks to fuel you when you get the munchies. And yes, Rest rooms available and clean.

If you enjoy:
A lively atmosphere.
Youthful spirited energy.
Friendly faces. And a barrage of clothing, vintage items, oddities, Art,  etc.

Then I'll see you there!</text>

<Text>There's nothing more LA than supporting local businesses and artists at this must-see market for clothing, jewelry, artwork, furniture, and pretty much anything else you can imagine. Buy your tickets online ahead of time to skip the line when you arrive. Keep in mind that parking can be hard to find!</Text>< pics>

Great location & variety of vendors. So many great finds, but also some vendors have the audacity to try over-charging for used clothing items that you could buy new today at Macy's for less 😅 do your research & haggle as necessary<//Review>

Don't go during the pandemic, guys. Bought tickets before realizing how crowded it was. Most people were wearing masks BESIDES THE PERSON WHO CHECKED OUR TICKETS...?! I didn't see any vendors clean any of their merchandise at any point. It seems like a breeding ground. Definitely wait to come until COVID 19 passes.<//text>

Overpriced. No "Trading" going on. Hipster Hangout. Gone are the days of anything worthwhile vintage. $5 to enter, I got a huge bag of pine cones as they are everywhere on the ground for the taking. Def $5 worth of cones, RIP Melrose Trading Post.<//review>

Really nice experience. Not a lot of social distancing but definitely encouraged. Mask were worn by mostly everyone. The Thai and Jamaican food trucks offered some great tasting food. I found some vintage and trendy items here. I would suggest prepurchasing a ticket to avoid waiting in line.</review>

It was $5 per adult to enter. We parked for free up the street in the residential area because it was Sunday. I didn't think anything was swap meet pricing and I think most of the second hand stores from Melrose Ave. opened a booth here. It was an entertaining afternoon and the Pad Thai from the food truck was delicious.</text>

Must wear a mask to enter and pay for a ticket. Proceeds benefit art programs for the fairfax highschool grounds that the market takes place on. Some vendors will also negotiate the prices. I bought a vintage italian sweater from the 70s for $25 instead of 35. And a Canon 35 mm camera from ' 99 for $60.
Not bad!
They also have many garden and house plants as well as holistic and organic options to clean your home.
But if you're looking for cheap costume jewelry, sun glasses and the perfect distressed tee, this ... Is the spot to be.</Review>< UserId.>

Great choice of vendors! The vibe here was so chill! Found some good stuff. Plants galore! Go early when it's not so damn hot. There are a few food trucks. I got super lucky with the parking but it is a challenge getting down Genesee Ave. Very narrow street.  Looking forward to my next visit.< /review>

The place to find unique one-off items. From clothing and accessories to furniture and trinkets. I love wandering around the aisles, getting lost and promising myself not to spend any more money. Hard to do.

They raised entrance fee prices from $3 to $5. Cash is best to have on you for most of these merchants.

Come right when it opens to find the best items. Or if you just want to browse, take your time and get here before they close or else you’ll get a million reminders on the loud speaker about closing in x-amount of minutes.

There’s a cute food court area - all located out doors. Get coffees here, rest your legs and unwind.

I love how people who shop here are wearing amazing, trendy clothes.</Text>

I love this flea market. It’s there every Sunday and there’s always so much to choose from. I saw Heidi Klum there with her daughter last time I went! Definitely check it out if you’re in the area. There is free valet parking here as well or street parking available. There’s always live music and food trucks here with delicious food!< /Text>

Awesome market. only a cupla bucks to enter main gate.Anything and everything type traders. We found treasures! New hand painted shirts through to vintage glass! Held at Fairfax High School grounds on Melrose, only on Sunday, the area this market takes up was very worthwhile taking the time to go and wander through, as it’s extensive. If you’re looking for an ‘Aladdin’s Cave’ treasure hunt market, this is it. Beautiful array of stock, a visual feast, well set up alleyways. Good food available, the restrooms are in the school building, and walkways are asphalt, some shaded, some sunny. also had a beaut little mini golf area kids can use for FREE, using fancy shoes as the bumpers.</Review>

This place is massive! It's also a bit of a maze so I would suggest getting a map. Don't come here if you are looking to get valuable items for super cheap prices. This isn't junkers laying stuff on tarps (which I happen to love also). The sellers here know what's for sale and prices are similar to antique stores or Etsy.< /text>

Not as good as it used to be even though it is bigger now. The set up seems to have no rhyme or reason now and not a lot of cool stuff like before. LACC is just as good if not better now and is a lot less to get in to.</Review>

We love the Melrose Trading Post, it opens every Sunday on Fairfax, supporting the local High School.

There are so many vendors filled with creatives who’ve come together to bring you affordable one of a kind pieces from; furniture to antiques, to jewelry, clothes, a shiatsu massage, crystals, vinyl records, dream catchers, plants... etc

There is a lovely square of food trucks and a live band.

Great place to go with friends, family, or with people visiting!< /Review>

I didn't know this place before until my daughter who is Miss Jr Teen Hollywood was there to sell some cookies in order to help some non proffit organizations. This place remind me of my home town Tlacolula plaza because there are a lot of different vendors so you can enjoy different kind of foods and flavors. You can also rest under a big tree with a big shade there. The cost for the entry is $5.00 each person. If one day you are there, I hope you search for the girls, Miss Hollywood and help them to help the program "No Kids Go Hungry." They sell water and sodas too.< /review>

So many awesome vendors: clothes,  accessories,  home goods, plants, art,  vintage,  repurposed,  new,  local,  global, you name it! I've bought handmade jewelry,  rugs,  candles,  homemade beauty products etc.
We also always go to the food area and get crepes and lemonade.  They have so many choices though.  Live music as well.  The best Sunday hangout.  Entry is now $5, I seem to recall. Might want to bring cash, although most vendors do square now.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmFXbNGuVk4GeQx5l7kMe3lquCPRQulzCPsD2S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

I could go on and on about this flea market - I have devotedly attended this Sunday tradition for years now and have watched it steadily grow in size, vendors, and popularity.  You can find an eclectic variety of wares here: vintage clothing, artisan and vintage jewelry, houseplants, antiques, local artists, new furniture from local craftsmen, food for all tastes and diets, knick-knacks galore, and even more items in between. Most vendors inside accept cash and cards, but be prepared for the cash-only entrance fee of $5. You’re guaranteed to find something you didn’t know you wanted every time you go.< /review>

Lot of creative stuff, good place to see creative stuff,,,very innovative, I found many old items like ..camera , ornaments, plants, hand made ornaments,
Many of them can bring their kids to show how an old camera looks like, stuff to decorate home, made with wood, iron, fur etc.< /Review>

<text>Very nice flea market. There is a great variety of goods on sale and you will be surprised by what you will find. Even if you dont buy anything just looking at all the wares is fun and worth the $5 dollar entrance fee.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7TzaU_-K1AxDtH2I3P7lbCIRrJTKeEK1x4cuV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXY04At2xex11yDd2w5jMyWuRufopupOE1E7wa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><name>Amir Kalantary<//name></record>

This place is amazing. I could get lost in this market for days. Downside is that some things are just overly priced but worth perusing.</review>

<rating>4</rating><GmapID>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e<//GmapID><review>This is a relatively fun, but small flea. It carries a $5 entry, but once you're in you're greeted with mostly vintage clothes, a few succulents and/or house plants vendors, some vintage print places, local Jewelers, vintage furniture, and a pretty great coffee place. It's more of a quirky outdoor home decor shop with a cover fee, but it does have its gems. Go here for clothing, or home decor. Don't come here for bargain hunting and lots of treasure hunting.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< date>

<Review>This is a relatively fun, but small flea. It carries a $5 entry, but once you're in you're greeted with mostly vintage clothes, a few succulents and/or house plants vendors, some vintage print places, local Jewelers, vintage furniture, and a pretty great coffee place. It's more of a quirky outdoor home decor shop with a cover fee, but it does have its gems. Go here for clothing, or home decor. Don't come here for bargain hunting and lots of treasure hunting.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I love hunting for treasures here. It gets pretty packed with “trendy” people who mostly shop for vintage clothes, which works great for me because it keeps the crowds concentrated at the clothing booths while I look for home decor. You’re able to find anything from antique pieces to modern handmade crafts. Most of the vendors are the same every week, but some change out and you’re able to find new things every time.</Review>

<Review>My first time at a flea market! There are two entrances ($3 each person). It's cash only, but if you don't have cash there is an ATM right by the entrance. Inside there are a lot of vintage items & stores that sell sunglasses, clothes, furniture, accessories, candles, food, & just some random items. Reminds me of an upscale outdoor swapmeet. It's only on Sunday's and it's just a fun spot to walk around! You may find a treasure or two!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Love the authentic italian food and choices, not to mention the cheap prices. You get your food like cafeteria style but it's so good and you can ask for small alterations in your order without the price going up. For example I wanted less noodles and more meat sauce. No bbn problem! They only accept cash is the only bad thing.< /review>

Had a good time walking around and looking at all the cool, vintage clothing/shoes/ jewelry and kitschy decor . Definitely have to visit the corn booth. The baked potatoes are at the same booth and are really tasty. Live music brings it all together.<//Review>

The boyfriend and I always walk pass by but we never went in until last Sunday. It was very interesting! There is an entrance fee of $5 per person but its totally worth it. This has to be one of the most trendiest flea market I have ever been to. They so much great and unique vendors. I was finally able to find the perfect camo jacket Ive been looking for, for lower than store price. The boyfriend and I got some healing gem stones for 2 for $15 and so on. I def would recommend!< /review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>If you check the website, there's usually a coupon for $1 off entry.

Early bird def gets the worm here.  If you arrive early there's parking, but if you are like most of LA you aren't gonna get any parking, good luck with that!

As my friend says, it's like an outdoor goodwill, so you don't get the musty smells.  Are you spending an arm and leg on stuff you can get for a few dollars at Goodwill?  Probably!  But the goods are always unique and there are also almost always celebrities if that's your thing.

There is always awesome music in the food area.  And the food isn't bad either!  The guy in the corner doing corn bowls is awesome with delicious kombucha on tap.  Other notable eateries include the crepe place and there are always samples of fries.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not exactly my style per say... very vintage.
The music, food and drinks were great ! Very nice set up too. The plants (for purchase) were BEAUTIFUL. Extremely hot inside here though because of all the tents. Also, I think the entrance fee of $5 was a little silly.</Review>

Then I drive down the Street to Little Johns toffee @Farmers Market...the Carmel apples r to die for.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This flea market never gets old. I love spending my Sundays here. The food is great and sitting and listening to the music is nice. Always something to purchase and prices are better now then when I used to go a couple years back. I would say you can clear about 2-3 hours of the day here. Even though it’s $5 now I still think it’s a good deal. They do have $1 coupons online so check it out. Also, you may bump into your favorite celebrity or musician because there always some wondering around.</Review>

<Review>First time here. It's awesome! Traffic is bad and parking is worse. And there was a line to get in. But that's all expected so if you aren't up for that, you chose the wrong place. Inside though, there are great vendors. Everyone was very friendly and tasty food stuffs!
Here's a photo of something that made me smile.<//Review>< Pictures>

The Melrose Trading Post is a weekly (Sundays) flea market type of outing, and it features many eclectic and trendy artisan and collectibles-type of vendors. I went here for the fragrances by RxCandles, a great producer of fine scents for personal and home use in aromatherapy.< /Review>

5 dollars to get in. Some booths are, to be honest, just people looking to get rid of junk they found at a thrift store. Some people sell vintage clothes (also probably thrifted) that could probably be cool but they’re a little hard to look through. The cooler vendors in my opinion were the ones selling handmade and refurbished furniture, some sold handmade jewelry, and the plant vendors were fairly priced. A good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.<//review>

Great place to check out if your in need of a decent deal, market food, shop till you drop and find a rare item.  Lotta vendors are trying to out price you so be ready to haggle.  Great time and will go again.  Please track the whole place or you won’t know!<//text>

<review>This place is a complete dive.  You can get everything there cheaper elsewhere.  If you buy there you're getting ripped. Super bored, disengaged unfriendly people.  $5 just to get in and look.  $5 just to look!? Zero atmosphere. Went to The Grove right after - it's free to look, straight away you're 5 bucks up.  It's also absolutely beautiful, not a grim dust ball; far better experience, product and prices.  Many other better things to do than get scammed at this dive market.<//review><Date>1560143062289< /Date><user>104437617259683469202< /user>< response>

<pictures>None</pictures><rate>4< /rate><review>Fun, and I thought there was a lot of variety in vendors. Vintage clothes intermingled with artist Renditions of old and new ideas. I found some great antique jewelry reasonably priced. A few seamstresses out there making some unique athletic wear as well as club attire. There is a cover charge to get in... I think it is worth it as I'm sure it decreases the vendors lease fee and not everybody sells what they'd like.</review>< date>

<text>This is a great "flea" market.  There are some that are mostly trash, but not this one.  It is well known and has great vendors of used, new and a mix of both.  Really good food vendors too.  Have only been a couple of times, but had good shoping experiences.  Have also had good breakfast burritos and even good live music.  Not only is it a shopping experience, but full family entertainment too.  Will always,go out of our way to check it out whenever in town.<//text>< pics>

This place is great! I love that the admission fee goes to a local high school's programs. The street market itself has a wonderful variety of handmade jewelry and products from local vendors, and folks selling vintage/used items. A great spot to find unique gifts or just to spend an afternoon (plan on taking some time to get through it all).</Text>

This little alley is suuuuuuuuuper cool. You want some odds and ends that can't be found other places (this is it) Such a good stop.

Music
Vintage Gear
Food trucks
Art
Shoes and more

This is what you expect in this part of town. Just a cool little stop for any age.< /Review>

Its a street market showcasing local artistry and people's vintage finds. What other would call junk could also be another person's treasure. No shortage of old clothes and ornaments. There's a vendor there that has a whole department store section for aloha shirts for 7.00. Great fit for summer or for a gift for your trendy teen. It's bigger than you think so take the time to explore. Also, say hi to all the dogs you'll see. Came around 1:20, didn't find parking until 2:00 so I suggest coming early. There's also a mini street market across the street. It's a great Instagram photo spot due to the fact that there's an angel wing mural at the entrance of it. Great place to visit for 2 or so hours.< /review>

Great food, great finds, tons of fun. a curated vintage, up cycled, recycled and hand made goods post. Multiple music options throughout, bathrooms, trash cans, valet parking, website.

Really great way to spend an afternoon. Really interesting items that I've never seen before. Im an antique junkie  and love places like this. Quite large. Expect to spend a couple hours but not a couple bucks...most things were way out of my price range.</Review>

< Review>
Of the flea market offerings in LA, this is a big one.  However, the dominant item is clothes, clothes, clothes.  If you are looking for curated/vintage home goods or local artists, artisans, etc, this swap meet does have some, but they are few in number compared to the clothing offerings.  It's mainly a younger crowd, so whatever used-clothing trend is happening at the moment for that audience, you'll find a lot of here.<//Review>

<Review>A fun place to spend an afternoon, but less useful for making purchases. From my perspective, the household goods weren't very varied, well-priced or high quality, but may just not be my style. Great people watching and food trucks though and admission is only $3 per person. I'd really like to give this spot 3.5 stars.

Also, uncomfortable restroom experience - guests can use bathrooms in the high-school, but the doors are so low that people standing in line waiting for the rest rooms can see you over your stall. Not sure how this isn't a problem for high-school students...<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Love this outdoor flea market. Great unique finds!
However, lately I’ve noticed the vendor’s prices increasing and merchandise is becoming a little too expensive which completely contradicts that of an  traditional flea market or swap meet.<//Review><rate>4</rate>< Name>

Ah I've been here so many times I can never get bored of this place. There is so much to see and so much to do. Plan to spend a good 3 hours walking around checking everything out. I love the coffee at the food truck in the middle of the market. Remember to bring cash for the door to get in.</Review>

5 bucks to get in and it's worth it. Tons of variety of things, but mostly clothes. People are interesting and there is live music of varying degrees of quality. I also saw some people going crazy over some "famous" people there, but I didn't know who they were.<//review>

I see this as an over rated market. Clothes, furniture and food - all were below average. The only good thing is to enjoy the music and songs played by the musicians. Also, few plant shops are wonderful. Also, the entrance fee varies depending upon your arrival time.<//review>

After arriving in 1997 & moving into the neighborhood it became one of my regular weekend destinations . Super cool then as now! A Melrose tradition! I love the early morning crush to get in... vendors & patrons. My most fond memories of the flea market are attending with all of my old friends. Remembering 20 years of sleepy mornings rolling down to the post. #oldschool #vintagestuff #ravers Thank You.< /Text>

It was a first visit for me. Lots of cool stuff, though a bit expensive (I think) for old, raggedy, stained vintage clothing. The atmosphere was chill I enjoyed the whole scene.<//review>

You have to come here! First off, the $3 admission ticket goes to the high school to help pay for programs that get cut (arts, physical fitness, etc). And then plan to stay AT LEAST four hours here. It’s amazing. So many different type of booths from grunge and cheap to chic and pricey. I stumbled upon this going up Melrose on a Sunday and I’m so glad I did! One of my favorite activities during my trip to LA.<//review>

Paid the $5 entry fee, walked amongst the snobs and well privileged fuctards for a couple hours.. I mean, the vendors were cool and easy to talk to, I even bought a skateboard, but the crowd of Spice-Girl Wanna-be's and people walking with their noses in the air who are too good to smile back at you - yeah, I'll pass next time and find us a fun Swap Meet to visit.<//text>

The hot spot for LA’s urban dwellers every Sunday, Fairfax High School parking lot is filled to the max of hipsters and kiosks ready to upscale your wardrobe or you interior decorating. Entry fee is under $5 and you can literally spend a whole day here checking out the shops, some live music and a delicious snow cone. Every trip to the Flea Market I walk away with new hand crafted jewelry or a groovy pair of sunglasses. Do yourself a favor and brave the parking to come wander around the asphalt, it will not disappoint.</text>

I mean, the vendors were cool and easy to talk to, I even bought a skateboard, but the crowd of Spice-Girl Wanna-be's and people walking with their noses in the air who are too good to smile back at you - yeah, I'll pass next time and find us a fun Swap Meet to visit.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Big flea market, Melrose = pricey but there are lots of vendors packed full of one of a kind goodies for you to take home and wow your friends and family. Lots of shopping in walkable distance so plan to make a day of it.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Nicest flea market I've been to, some interesting crafts and art.  Parking is a pita though and $5 to enter.< /text>

<text>This place is crazy, no offense, but when you hear that assume an offensive comment follows. It's a giant thrift store outdoors, most of it and I mean most, is used clothing.

You could literally get the same stuff at your local thrift store for a fraction of the price there, plus $5 to get in, yeah that's crazy.< /text>

This place is crazy, no offense, but when you hear that assume an offensive comment follows. It's a giant thrift store outdoors, most of it and I mean most, is used clothing. So if your into the whole BoHo seen, head right over.< /Text>

Not a good flea market basically a place for hipsters to come meet for coffee on the weekend not a good place to find anything really cool vintage wise don't recommend it go to the Pasadena City College one that's much better</Review>

(Translated by Google) Admission fee $ 5 / Stamp your back
Food truck meals, small shows, clothes, flower pots, accessories, antiques, furniture, shoes, photos, picture frames, cameras, and candles.
From looking good new products to garbage
From something you want to be a little expensive to selling at a reasonable price
There are many kinds of things, so it's fun to watch them and the time goes by quite a bit, but I personally have nothing to buy ^^;

(Original)
입장료 5불 / 손등에 도장찍어주고 입장
푸드트럭같은 식사, 작은 공연, 옷, 화분, 악세서리, 골동품, 가구, 신발, 사진, 액자, 카메라, 캔들 정말 다양한 종류를 한 데서 팔고 있었습니다.
괜찮아보이는 새제품부터 쓰레기가 아닌가 싶은 것까지
조금 비싸다 싶은 것부터 꽤 저렴하게 파는것까지
여러 종류의 것들이 있다보니 구경만해도 재미도 있고 시간이 꽤 금방 지나갑니다만 개인적으로 전딱히살건없더라고요^^;< /text>

(Translated by Google) One of the best popular markets in Los Angeles and worth a visit, the prices are very reasonable and the merchandise is very unique and there is music on stage in the food side. Overall the place is worth a try.

It opens only on Sunday, the entrance fee to the place is $ 5. Most places require cash to pay, but there are withdrawal machines with an additional fee.

(Original)
من أفضل الأسواق الشعبية في لوس أنجلس و يستحق الزيارة، الأسعار مناسبة جدا و البضاعة جدا فريدة و يوجد موسيقى على المسرح في جهة المأكولات. بشكل عام المكان يستحق التجربة.

يفتح فقط يوم الأحد، رسوم الدخول الى المكان ب٥ دولار. أغلب الأماكن تتطلب كاش للدفع، و لكن تتواجد مكاين سحب مع رسوم إضافية.</review>

(Translated by Google) A large flea market held every weekend at high school.
It costs $ 5 per person to enter.
It can be purchased for less than half the price of used clothing stores in Japan.
They also sold miscellaneous goods, accessories, antiques, used clothes and furniture.
There are many stylish people so you can enjoy just entering.

(Original)
毎週末高校で行われる大型フリーマーケット。
入場に一人5ドルかかります。
日本の古着屋のだいたい半分以下の値段で購入できます。
雑貨、アクセサリー、骨董品、古着、家具まで売っていました。
お洒落な人がたくさんいるので入るだけでも楽しめます。<//Text>

(Translated by Google) There are many cute shops that are smaller than Rosebowl's flea market! Compared to rosebowl, there are more accessory stores, so this is recommended for those who want a necklace.
You can enjoy a variety of food trucks and live performances.

(Original)
Rosebowlのフリマより小さいけどかわいい店が多い！rosebowlと比較するとアクセサリー店が多めなのでネックレスとか欲しい人はこっちがオススメ。
フードトラックが充実してたりあちこちでライブやってたり、いろいろ楽しめます。< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The Flea market is located in Fairfax High School, on Elle's famous Mallory Street. Admission is $ 5, free valet parking. It's always crowded with young people and tourists living near Hollywood. If you come to Los Angeles, the center of world entertainment, I recommend you to stop by.

(Original)
엘에이 유명한 맬로즈거리,Fairfax high school에서 열리고 있는 Flea market으로 볼거리 먹거리 살거리가 많은 곳입니다. 입장료가 5불이고, free valet parking입니다. Hollywood근처에 사는 젊은이들과 관광객으로 항상 붐비죠. 세계 Entertainment 의 중심지인 Los Angeles 에 오시면, 꼭 들르셔야 하는 곳우로 추천 드립니다.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a nice antique fair, there are also some artisan exhibitors. Approx 200 stalls there are also food shops and when I went there was a girl singing live with her guitar. It is done every Sunday and admission is $ 2. I parked one block away on the street at no charge. You can haggle or ask for a better price. There are very nice articles. Worth a visit.

(Original)
Es una linda feria de antigüedades, también hay algunos expositores artesanales. Aprox 200 puestos también hay negocios de comidas y cuando yo fui había una chica cantando en vivo con su guitarra. Se realiza todos los domingos y la entrada es de 2 dólares. Yo estacione a una cuadra, en la calle, sin cargo. Se puede regatear o pedir mejor precio. Hay muy lindas artículos. Vale la pena visitarlo.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Quite wide this swapmeet offers a lot of variety. You find quite a few things depends on your taste.
Also When you visit this place do not forget to take a little tour of the food stalls. Many choices and everything tasty, especially the Mexican food from Alberto I love when I go I do not hesitate to stop by for some tamales or a dish that they prepare. Delicious.

(Original)
Bastante amplio este swapmeet ofrece mucha variedad. Encuentras bastantes cosas depende de tu gusto.
Ademas Cuando visites este lugar no olvides hecharte una vueltesita por los puestos de comida. Muchas elecciones y todo sabroso especialmente la comida mexicana de albertos me encanta cuando voy no dudo en pasar a hecharme unos tamalitos o un platillo de los q ellos preparan. Delicioso.<//Review>
