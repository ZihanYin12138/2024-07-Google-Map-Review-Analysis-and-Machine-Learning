< review>
Does not honor Yelp Check-in Discount and charges $60 if you enter after 8pm. Overall, they are ok. I liked the 4am access hour. I didn't like how they advertise access 4am-945pm, but conveniently leave out the  $60 charge if you want to access your items after 8pm. I also didn't like that they didn't honor the Yelp check-in discount of 50% for first 2 months. The lady was like, we don't have that discount. We can give you 20%. That's a dramatic difference and when I called to make my appt before I showed up with my belongings, I mentioned the discount. So that was frustrating. The lady finally was like, well I can give you 20% off of the first 3 months. Then I also mentioned that I have USAA rental insurance, so I don't have to pay the monthly  $9 fee. My phone was at literally 0% on power save mode, so I couldn't pull up the proof. I asked to use the store phone and was denied. (The lady said that they only have 1 line...) Then I was like well I will use my phone until it dies. She was like, " Well you only have 3minutes  to call USAA because the screen will timeout and you will have to go outside and use the kiosk because she has to go on lunch...... Which I believe several thungs she said was false. It was 1:30pm, so they would close the store at 1pm for lunch while other people are there? I honestly think she was bothered that I had a coupon and wanted to make my process as difficult as possible for me. The 2 reasons I choose this place over other locations was due to their hours and Yelp Check-in Discount, both which didn't workout how I thought!!</review>

<review>I was looking for a place to store my vehicle so I searched on google. Sav-On Storage was the best option available for me. They were very professional They have great prices and very nice staff. I was helped by Monica who was also very nice and helpful with the services that I needed. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for good service and affordable pricing.< /review>< Pictures>

<user>104239799822526989532< /user><Text>I have been your customer for 10 years and the service had been the best in the town and also the most expensive year after year, but it had been worth it because the mail was never 'missing', the front desk friendly and helpful;in other words, a first class service but something has been happening with the management; I had a case, I received a package delivered on November 9 and I went to pick it up and it was not anywhere and it was delivered to me until November 23 since I needed it for November 14, I had no choice but to order it with express critical delivery again. O.K. that was the first and the second; They put confidential medical correspondence in the wrong box, the person who received it, fortunately that someone returned it to me without a sender from Montana, explaining that person, he/she opened it without notice it, since it was in the correspondence and from there, this person went to the airport and on the flight, notice my envelope, when it arrived in Billings, put it in the post office, it was an appointment that we expected for my son with special needs for 8 months; the envelope arrived a day before the appointment, November 28. I am willing to pay these boxes because in San Diego is increasingly common the theft of packages from the houses and until then I had been very satisfied with the service, hopefully it return to normally, it will be a shame to have to look for another reliable place.< /Text>< pics>

First time I ever have a reason why to rate this place poorly. As they say “Your only as good as your weakest employee”,  unfortunately the store manager is the weakest link here. Janet has an attitude, she’s snooty and disrespectful.< /review>

Great service from top to bottom. Accessible hours and secure as can be. Great prices that makes for a great move. Their year around facility is a great idea why don't other storages have that. Don't forget they also sell packing supplies and offer insurance which is a match made in heaven. You can pratically store anything in your house with them from stuff in your attic to everything in garage including your cars.< /Text>

Had 2200 dollars of my stuff ruined by the water truck during the repaving they did this past summer.  Filed a claim 2 months ago and still never got a call back.  Can’t get ahold of management becaus they apparently don’t have a contact number or email.  So that’s been great.  I’m down all my wife’s purses, a couch, a bat from my grandfathers league in the 40’s. Some decorations and bedding. So that’s been fantastic!!!< /text>

I switched to them after the USPS  lost my mail several times and learning that they don't change the keys after you cancel them, so a previous user was stealing my checks!!! Anyway, I have been with these guys a few months now and I really like their customer service. They are polite, and actually go out of their way to satisfy customers, they notify me about packages  that arrive and make sure I get all my mail delivered, and if there are issues, they let me know ASAP. I like that they are open on Saturday until late and 30 mins more during the week, that allows me to get to them after business hours. They even have a FB page! Super good for fast communication and record keeping. I was just telling my family how good this change has been for us.< /text>< rate>

I visit chula vista once a week and I have my storage there, but Saturday 11/25  I traveled only to pick up my mail but I was surprised because they closed 2 hours from 1 to 3pm and I lose time plus I will wait until next week to obtain my stuff, maybe you need more staff to cover this issues!<//Review>

I love angel nail and spa! I have been going here for years. The ladies are all very professional and if I ever have a problem they always fix it! They also have the most amount of mail colors possible. Anything you want you can have there! I personally think they are the best nail salon in the South Bay!<//review>

Very clean, very nice staff. Owner is wonderful. Very happy with all 3 service I had. I was a last minute walk in, they were very happy I came in. They made time for me even though they had a study flow of appointments.</review>

Angel Nail Spa continues to be my usual place, even though I moved further away. If you're up for a walk, it's easy to park for free near the library half a mile away, or there is garage parking under the spa. The spa itself is sunny and open, the ladies are all wonderful. At this point I usually go for a gel manicure and new skin pedicure, and they take wonderful care of me. It's a great escape for an hour or so. I try to remember to call ahead, but I also can't remember waiting long as a walk-in.< /Review>

Poor quality . I need to explain how correct the shape of the nails several time because they all very different shaped. When I asked them to redo it, they have shown a bad attitude saying me everything is great. The other girl corrected my nails finally , charged me $72( correcting their own mistake) but on top of all one of my finder got infected...if it won’t get better I have to to the doctor
My suggestion is better to get better quality but for a little extra price than to go to that salon and get that kind of bad experience
I think it is very important to do a quality, but not quantity even it cost a little bit extra for the service . Any successful business should make customers happy by providing professional service !</text>

This is was my first and last time going there
I got my nails done 4 days ago (acrylic refill)
And my nails need a refill already today is the 4th day of getting them ready at angel nails & spa
They charge me 84 for a refill and pedicure + I tipped her 15$ .
I really like how my nails looks and it’s a cute shape and color but I’m so sad that in the 4th day it start getting off of the bottom of the nail 😭😭< /text>

I have been going to angel nail since I moved to Hermosa about a year ago. THey do a great job, are very well priced and the staff is always friendly. You don't have to feel guilty for changing your mind or asking for what you need at this nail salon. Very professional environment.< /Review>

<Text>5-Star service the first time I went to Angel in September. 2-Star service or less the most recent time I went (Sunday). They upsell you as much as possible, and pretend like there is a language barrier and miscommunication when you say you don’t want the additional service. I loved the service the first time I went there- so much so that I drove and hour and a half down to Hermosa again JUST for their location. If you do go to this location, be VERY firm about the service you want. Know what you’re paying for, because they will take advantage of you if you don’t.< /Text>< Response>

Everyone is good in the shop. At least 6 girls can do gel manicures. They are always consistent. I see Cindy, Jenny, Nina. All are great.< /Text>

Ok to be fair, this is of course a fast food restaurant. However, in all the fast food restaurants, this one is really our favorite!

Often we are so tired from work and just looking to have a quick dinner. Noodles & Company is always reliable, and with the free delivery from DoorDash it’s just the place for that last minute delicious lifesaver.

For those who’ve never been there, Noodles & Company has a very simple menu. Few noodle choices served with different sauces like pesto, Alfredo, marinara... But the thing that appealing is that all their menu items can be made vegetarian! All of them!

I would highly recommend you’re try the Pesto Caviapatti. And the spaghetti Alfredo is one my favorites. Also FYI: their Mac-and-cheese side and tomato bisque soups are fantastic! Totally worth the extra $3.</text>

I can't get enough zoodles. They have perfected the use of vegetable noodles. Try the zucchini shrimp scampi, if you're good with seafood, it's awesome.< /review>

Enjoyed the Thai noodles and the green salad as well. Reasonably priced, especially when it's so big I can make a second meal out of it! Generous with the noodles and staff was friendly.<//Review>

<Text>One of my favorite Noodles and Company place in the bay. Went here twice and both times it was great. The spicy beef noodle soup is SCRUMPTIOUS. And get the peach sparkling drink. It's also DELICIOUS. The beef is super tender.

A little on the pricey side excellent food and small portions. Found myself spending about $16 per person in my party. Noodles are cheap, increase the portions and make me feel I'm getting what I paid for. The food is good though, love the primavera pasta with chicken. The garlic toast is awesome. Service was impeccable, all present were kind, courteous and helpful. Overall experience was a four because I felt I did not get a portion equal to the cost. With Olive garden nearby and limitless pasta bowls available they should rethink portions and offer a larger serving size<//text>

I love this place, only I was disappointed in the flavors this time. We ordered the peanut sauce noodles w/chicken. The peanut butter sauce was just too much, too thick and rich for me. Great flavor though and good serving of chicken.  Also ordered the korean beef noodles. The flavor was too sweet and tangy for me. The potstickers I didn't realize we only got 5 of our 6 piece serving, but that's ok because the didn't taste very fresh, just ok. The dipping sauce was great. The side of mac was delish.< /text>

<Review>Eli (i hope that's how his name is spelled)was very helpful, very welcoming, and very nice.
He made the experience enjoyable!  (He should get employee of the month!)
Food tasted great and was very well portioned (big plate filled with noodles!).
Noodles and Company is my fave when visiting California.  I wish we had one in Tucson, AZ.  But it makes the trip to Cali exciting to know this restaurant is there.<//Review>< name>

<review>The Japanese pan noodles are a great meal and low on the caloric intake compared to many of their other dishes, which is surprising since the dish was tasty and well worth trying on our first visit. The restaurant decor and cleanliness was kinda blah but the noodles made up for it.< /review>< Time>

We love Noodles & Co.. Ordering was a bit off at this location (simple order items seemed to confuse the staff... maybe they were training someone... we've all been the newbie once). We actually hit this location twice in as many days (stocking up since we don't live near a Noodles) and it was consistently good. They also have w Freestyle Coke machine (which is awesome, btw). Heads up: the BBQ Mac was much better than the Buffalo Mac (for which I had very high hopes). It seems like they prepare the Mac differently for the Buffalo (less creamy) and that, combined maybe with the parmesan the add, really made the Buffalo Mac seem dry or mealy. I totally ate it; just saying.<//review>

My takeout order was cold by the time I got home, contrary to the many services I've received in the last FEW years. The food sat open and exposed on the shelf too long before it was properly packaged.

Reason: Inexperienced and ineffective help you've hired. This may be cost effective to you it's detrimental to my satisfaction.

Thus, today I'll give the lowest rating possible: 1.< /Text>< UserId.>

My fiance and I love this place. Good food and a fair price and staff is always nice and friendly.  The food comes out fast and is always good. They also have the cool coke machines that have all the flavors, which I really like.  Always clean and they clean the tables after you leave. Love this place and it is usually not to crowded which is nice.< /Text>

I truly enjoyed my meal here. They had such a great variety (of noodles) to choose from. I'm trying to watch my calorie intake and there wasn't too much I couldn't have from the menu. The small size with a protein is just enough and then I added a side. All for about $10.<//text>

<Text>Friendly and helpful staff. Very clean. The lemon wedges to squeeze into iced tea are cut perfectly. The ice dispenser is one of those hateful ones built in to the misbegotten multiselection drink machine. Thai curry noodles are tasty but not as spicy as I'd like. I plan to return soon, even though it is far out of my way, to try the macaroni and cheese dishes.</Text>< pictures>

This was a favourite place of mine in Chicago that has recently made its way to Orange County. It features numerous pasta dishes including Asian and Italian dishes, as well as a variety of Mac and cheese.< /review>

I've seen the slice a few times now and wanted to give it a try. We had planned on going to another restaurant in this area but it was very crowded so we headed over to Noodles & Company. I was a little skeptical when I saw the menu had a bit of a schizophrenic feel with so many varieties from Asian to American to Italian. So glad we stuck around and gave it a shot. We tried an appetizer of the Korean meatballs the Mediterranean salad and the Korean beef noodles. Everything was excellent! Fresh taste and good service. Very glad we found this spot because we will definitely be back.</review>

All you do is noodles, but I guess it's just too hard. Ate here three times, first time I got the pad thai the noodles were crunchy. Second time mac and cheese water and undercooked chicken, and the third time had a salad and Korean meatballs... not bad<//Review>

One of their new beef noodle dishes actually sent me to the ER. Thankfully my wife was home and able to get me in the car and to the hospital... mind you, this was a single experience and not necessarily a shining example or what everyone's experience might be. I should also say that I had been here a few other times to sort of "test the flavors" before hand. Each of those experiences however was also pretty lack-luster to say the least. Come to think of it, I've never once left this place feeling satisfied, so after this last visit, I think it's safe to say that noodles & company is officially off the list of dinner options from here on out.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Had interactions with two different employees here, both had a very negative attitude. When our food was served we felt the portions were very small. No other Noodles location served us like this. Ordered a regular size steak stroganoff and got half a plate of cooked noodles (very watery, apparently they don’t know how to strain noodles here) with what seemed like a sad attempt at some peices of dry steak (no sauce) and a dash of cheese on top. Also literally had one piece of mushroom. One (this is not a joke). Going to the Raising Canes across the street after this. Don’t come here.< /Text>< pictures>

Noodles were very overcooked and had been sitting for a while.
Ordered the Asian dish with steak and it was very dry.</text>

Always a pleasure coming here. The people that work here are great !! Very friendly to everybody that visits. The food is Uhhhh Mazzzzing !! They have a great menu with choices from all over. Fresh ingredients and sauces with a great flavor. The dining room is kept clean and they can have some people come through here. If there's a line they get you through pretty good and if you have the app you can order ahead on line. Try a little smolder from Boulder seasoning if you like some spice but be careful...it will sneak up on you. We love having more Noodles & Company out here and hope you enjoy it as much as we do. Bon Appetit !!!!< /Review>

We first went the the Vancouver, WA location and we were thothoroughly impressed. Then this one opened up in our area. We have been probably 4 or 5 times and i just kept hoping it was "a bad batch" but no this location cant make decent pasta. I dont plan on ever going back. The butter noodles are LITTERALLY swiming in butter. There is almost more butter then noodle gross. And the mac n cheese was DISGUSTING. Mac n cheese is one of my 4 year olds FAVORITE and even she wouldnt eat it. Her mac n cheese litterally was a pile if noodles also swimming in greese with a TINY bit of cheese sprinkled on top. Flavor and quality aside  why anyone would pay that much money for 15 noodles is beyond me.

We ordered the butter noodles and mac n cheese at thr Vancouver location. The bowl of butter noodles was huge. Less greesy and more flavor. The mac n cheese was thick with cheese sauce.</review>

<Text>Very beautiful place at night. I usually get food and eat it up here watching the view. Weekends are especially cool, a lot of teens come up here with music and just hang out and have a good time no drama at all.<//Text>< rate>

<Review>So, Google wants me to rate a parking lot.. I saw cars parked there, so I guess it is serving it's purpose. I've never actually parked there, but I have passed by several times while riding my bike. So, if you are looking for a place to park your car and access the path along the Aquaduct,  it's great. I recommend it to many of my customers as a way to get in a bike ride without worrying about cars...<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great spot to take your date to and look out over the entire Antelope Valley, as well as, have a little private time with that special person...it's not a very big spot and it usually has a few visitors at any given time, but you can always find a spot to scoot into and do....whatever!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

If your an AV local like myself, then this spot means more to you than just some Aqua Duct🌄🚴‍♂️🐶🛸

Tae'lor and I love watching the Sunrise 🌞

For an amazing Sunset:
head West on Ave N coming from 60th st W,  immediately to your left after the hill, there's an area towards the back,  this is where you have to drive uphill a bit.
The Sunsets there are Stunning 🤩

Don't take my word for it, get up and go see it for yourself!!! 🌞😁< /Review>

Amazing service, friendly staff, and a great haircut. A little more pricey than I normally spend on a haircut but it was worth it.</Text>

<review>I rarely give reviews but what a great spot. If you’re in the area and need a good haircut COVID-19 and beyond, come here. Daniel was kind, professional, and efficient—all while being safe and maintaining a clean space. I was in and out within 20 minutes with a clean fade. What more could I ask?

They do take walk-ins but it’s better if you book online through their website under “Services.” I highly recommend theDAPPERY and will be coming back<//review><Time>1599693659807<//Time>< Gmap_id>

As soon as we walked in we were welcomed.  Safety precautions are in place. Very clean, organized, and the TV's around make you feel at home.  Daniel nailed both my son and my haircut.  I showed him a picture of what we wanted and he asked questions through out the haircut to make sure it was perfect.  Highly recommended.< /review>

First time at this place they are cool gave me what I asked for which was nothing major. but price was crazy I paid 47 dollars for a 15 min cut I had them trim the sides and the back , didn't want the top touched because I'm growing it out . I was shocked at the price.  So if you go here get a quote before they start .<//Review>

Very clean,professional, friendly comfortable environment and experience! Have been getting cut by Dan for years now. Hands down the best barbershop you can find with a 35 mile radius easily! Not your typical beat up barber shop that had a coat of paint slapped on the walls. Every detail was done perfect and could see this barbershop easily being know as the best place in the Bay Area for a fine grooming experience. Also offering other services as well. Definitely a one stop shop and worth every minute!

Thanks Dan as always. Great job man

Great Barbershops are hard to come by. What Daniel has created here is the greatest. Family oriented. Comfortable. Catch the game while you wait. Treat your lady to a pedicure or get you daughter some fresh French braids. Good vibes. Black Owned and everyone is welcome. Sure to be a pillar in the community.</text>

Dan the man is what I said after my haircut. It’s hard to find a barber that understands what haircut you desire let alone have great hands cutting hair. Great environment and Not to mention new shop on the block. Great barber and great clean shop.</review>

I have been here twice since it opens. Both times I have left with one of the best cuts I've ever had. When I first walked I was greeted and directed to the iPad. I waited for my cut on the soft sofa and watched espn. Once I got into the chair I introduced myself. We began speaking on current events and sports. As a fan of the Raiders I recommend my barber Daniel to everyone. Hes a competent, honest, precise, barber. Plus he gave my an image I will never forget. Guy is great. I'll be a life long customer.  In conclusion, take you time and go see what the buzz is all about. The Dappery is doing great local cuts.<//Text>

The place is clean and professional, the decorum is super comfortable and has an attention to detail focused on the customer experience while you’re waiting to be seen (free wi-fi, charging stations, flat screen tv’s). But most of all the barbers are talented! I followed the owner from the previous shop he used to work at prior to venturing out on his own, and even though his new shop is a little farther out than the one he used to work at before, I choose to travel the extra miles for his services because he’s just so talented. I highly recommend you check this shop out, because in my opinion it’s the best one out there.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808f91d551a937f7:0x8c370a2458fe114b<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Dan (the owner) has been cutting my hair for the past 15 years  and is the only barber I trust! Dan’s new shop is great and has all you can ask for in a barber shop - comfortable atmosphere, modern look, a ton of TV’s and modern technology (you can pay with a card). Check him out!!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I was in a roll over accident last year, the Berg Injury Lawyers team did a great job of keeping me updated, informed, and that I was understanding the process of my entire case. Everyone I spoke to over the phone was very friendly and did everything to make sure I got the knowledge I needed and that I was being taken care of. I would like to thank Benny and Ken for doing such a fantastic job. Highly recommend!</Text>< pics>

Though it took longer than I expected and I didn't get near what I anticipated I can say Delia was very caring and answered all my questions.

Personally I would have been more aggressive especially with all the information that was available it should've been a clear cut case in my favor but I wasn't privy to conversations with the guilty parties insurance, the driver attempted to beat a red light, had no license, no insurance and left the scene but did return.  I am very thankful to The Most High that I am still here but the injuries I sustained will be a lifelong battle.

I know there are a lot of working parts and I feel that there was way too much negotiations going on with the guilty parties "miraculous" insurance but thank goodness I am a responsible driver and car owner and carried the correct insurance and for that my under insured motorist allowed me to receive a settlement one year and two months later.

Delia you are a sweetheart and I do sincerely appreciate your help.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVSSp85MzVannX32HPgDJbHNVELvmRvWkcB0hU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Amazing experience overall, i know the whole idea of acquiring representation or a lawyer can be a daunting task, but at Berg they made the whole process so seamless, and i felt comfortable and taken care of throughout the whole process. Berg guided me through, and took a huge weight off my shoulders during a situation that would usually cause so much unneeded stress and work. I highly recommend to anyone who has been injured to at least call and find out for yourself why they are the best in the business!!<//Review>

After my horrible car accident I was completely against getting a lawyer but my husband convinced me to use Berg Injury Laywer. I'm so glad I did.  Just received my settlement and people were shocked it didn't take longer.  I'm happy.  I'd use them again for sure.<//Text>

I was referred to Berg Injury Lawyers by our best friend who had witnessed the wonderful care they had given his co-worker. After making the call to them, they came to my home to make the initial paperwork easier for me. (I was an emotional mess) They made phone calls and interceded on my behalf, gathered all medical bills, information, documents, evaluations, progress & reports. They made sure every medical concern I had was checked out and treated  They kept me informed of each step in the process and made sure I was comfortable with every decision made on my behalf.  They answered all of my questions until I understood them completely. They kept track of everything that was needed to fight for and protect me.  They caught billing errors and negotiated lower fees for my medical services which put even more money in my pocket. With that being said... their services weren’t just about making sure I received the highest settlement possible. (of which they went far beyond my expectations). From day one, EVERYONE in the Modesto office treated me with respect, kindness, compassion, understanding, patience and with HEART. They take the time to get to know their clients. We are a “real person” to them. They had no fear standing up against one of the larger company’s in the area who would’ve otherwise tried to minimize the hardship, strain and chaos of what  their employees’ negligence put me through. They will fight for you and make sure every detail is taken care of, every “i” doted, every “t” crossed, so there are no surprise bills after your case is closed. With Berg Injury Lawyers, peace of mind for their clients is just as important as the settlement.</Text>

I had a great experience with Berg Injury Lawyers. They are very professional and they have a very fast and efficient response time. Shant has been awesome. He is knowledgeable and has answered all my questions. He is efficient and has always gotten back to me when he promised. He is an asset to your company. Thank you to Berg Injury Lawyers and your staff for helping me with my case. I would definitely refer you to anyone of my friends and family needing your services.< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>They dont even deserve 1 star. I asked them multiple times what my case was worth and they said just keep going to the doctor. After 100,000 in medical bills they told me i was offered 25,000 so i would get nothing. Then when i questioned that they quit leaving me to settle my case but only after putting a lean on my case for 9,000 leaving me with far less then my medical bills and to handle my case. they did not earn that money i did. The bar is already looking into this but save your self some trouble find a better law office.</Text><Time>1567778599759< /Time>< UserId.>

<review>My inlaws referred me to Berg Injury Lawyers, they had a good experience with Berg 15+ years ago. The day I called someone was at my home starting the process. Never being in this position before, Berg associates were very helpful. The process took a little more than a year. In that time I was always kept up to date on my case. Thank you to everyone at Berg for the help!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Jeanie Ringgenb<//name></record>

I am so grateful that I called Berg injury Lawyers after my accident! They helped me get into the treatment I needed, and had I not received it, I could be worse off. They had a great team of people who worked  on my behalf so that I didn't have to deal with that extra stress and my injuries. One of the best decisions I ever made!</text>

How is it possible that you did absolutely NOTHING I fired you and you submitted a claim with the insurance company and charged a fee when my other lawyer did all the work? Avoid this place! They'll take all your money and you will be lucky to get a dime even if you get rid of them. I didn't think they could do that but apparently they can. The we don't get paid unless you win is a very TRUE statement! If you involve them in any way and retain another attorney and that other attorney wins your case Berg STILL takes your money keep that in mind!!!

In response to the reply I got don't play dumb! You guys had a lean with the insurance company and even though we fired you yes you Berg Injury lawyers you sent the insurance company a bill for the phone calls for a couple of faxes that where sent and "time" that was spent on my case. They insurance company deducted the amount you said you were owed out of MY money! And yes once again it was you Berg injury lawyers. Anyone that doesnt believe me. Hire them. Fire them. Once your case settles let me know how much they said they were "owed".< /Text>

If you've been injured in a car wreck you definitely need to call Berg Injury Lawyers.  From the very first call they work to make you feel part of the family and ensure they work hard to get you the money you need from your injuries.< /review>

<date>1468944206078</date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>Really unprofessional I don't know how they do it. I have a case we won't and the case workers here say whatever to get you off the phone. Yes Mrs. Latino we will call you back and update you on your case by the end of the day.. Not! Yes I will let you know what the outcome was.. Not! And when you call you can hear how annoyed they are by your phone call and it's like they purposely drag your case as long as possible just to get back at you for disturbing them. I've had other lawyers take half as long as Berg. I  always say if you don't plan on doing what you say don't say it at all! This is the first and last time I  will ever hire Berg.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>Such an amazing spot! Spent all day here. Great place to check out amazing views, surf, and enjoy the West Coast at its finest. Low tide exposed great tide pools with many great animals. Wind is mostly blocked by the huge rock wall which was great with cooler temps.<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

Very clam and good Beach, big surface to play for kids, not good for swimming because surface goes deep with water, mostly people comes here for surfing. Need 5-10 minutes walk from main road but easy to reach to beach with kids or older people.<//text>

Awesome and beautiful beach. Parking is free but have to take a short walk. No restrooms. You can also hike above the beach and views are gorgeous (just beware of steep cliffs).<//text>

Quiet, tucked away, and hiding some of the best surf on the central coast. There's a secret way to drive here but most people park along the highway and walk to the shore. You can also bike from Wilder Ranch in just a few minutes and enjoy the fantastic cliffside views. This area is also a legal drone flying area so you may hear some buzzing.<//Text>

<text>Amazing beach. Went at low tide in the morning. Only one other family on the beach. The low tide gave way to some tide pools to see crabs, starfish, and other creatures.</text>< response>

<Text>This beach is an absolute favorite. The lack of parking, no restrooms and half a mile walk to the beach insures it’s usually quieter than other Santa Cruz beaches, with mostly surfers. The beach is long enough for a great walk. Low tide gives fabulous access to tide pools, and the wildflowers are insane here in the spring. Lots of gulls, seals and other birds.  I come here often to paint as it’s so peaceful. Please pack out your trash if you come here :)<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLXH0_14o9njKG5zQzhpHzDnuZZp6c3pEoXCxW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The beach is clean, private and plenty of sand. It was not very crowded for a summer Saturday afternoon 👍🏼👍🏼Watched surfers, dogs play, enjoyed our packed lunch and had a quiet beach nap 👍🏼😴

If hike a bit further to the left you will come to a hidden grotto to watch the waves crash against the rocky shore. Very peaceful! Oh, and we saw a few seals pop their heads up to survey us ☺️

It’s about a ten minute walk from the parking lot which is pretty broken up so be careful! No public bathrooms tho 😩< /review>

Beautiful and empty during a full moon. Parking was hard to find, and parking turns off from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.

The secluded coves were just stunning in the moonlight</review>

Super nice beach to watch the waves crash up on the sea stacks and the sun set over the cliffs. Lots of space to set up and lots of sand and beach to roam and walk around on. Entrance and parking are a little sketchy and not super easy on a regular vehicle but doable nonetheless.</review>

It's been about a decade since the last time I've visited this beach. my older brother had brought our family here on an outing.. and I remember loving how quiet and chill this beach was (even though we found a huge dead seal that day)...
I was pleasantly surprised that it has not changed at all... you have to walk a bit of a distance to actually get to the beach/ocean, and it can get very windy, so I don't believe it would be a good idea to carry a whole bunch of stuff (like when you go to the boardwalk). It is a beautiful beach to go relax in with a blanket.. or walk along to the other side and look at the all the little shellfish that are growing on the rocks.. be super careful though, because the waves hit out of no where and can knock you down or into the ocean (if you do bring small kids, maybe don't go to that side of the beach)
I honestly think this beach is where people come out to go surfing though.. because I remember most of the people there were surfers back on my first visit here.. and the handful of people here today also all went out into the water.<//review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Wow!  How relaxing.  We visited the beach for the day with another family.  In the afternoon we built a fire with driftwood, keeping it going with some of the dried seaweed we found lying on the beach.  We sat around the fire, and something about the whole place made everyone cheerful, happy, even giggly.  Drove back to town and had dishes at various restaurants:  nachos, curried goat, and cheesecake, then bought some bbq potato chips and grapes for the ride home.  A day by the sea really gives you an appetite!</text><name>Alicia Woodrow</name>< userid>

This is one of our favorite beaches  We have been coming here for the last 10 years and the cleanliness at the beach has gone down. I think the literacy ( common sense index) rate has fallen down with people visiting. There is a big board which mentions "no dogs" allowed where as the beach has people coming with their dogs. As it is a no dog beach there is no requirement to cleanup after your dog is done with their waste management. The area around the beach has started smelling like one. "No fire or barbecue" allowed on the be beach which again is violated by the young crowd visiting the beach. Rangers should visit the beach more often to keep check on such violations so visitors to the beach can enjoy it more as it was before a few years back.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very good beach to relax, it is wide with sand and with some cliffs that will leave you surprised!
The walk of approximately 1km from the parking lot is worth it !!

Very nice beach to relax, the cliffs on both sides are incredible. The walk of 1km from parking side is worth

Muy buena playa para relajar, es amplia de arena y con unos acantilados que te dejarán sorprendid@!
La caminata de aproximadamente 1km desde el estacionamiento vale la pena!!

Ambiance was low key chic. Drinks unfortunately were not good.< /Review>

Suggested to have a reservation. Great atmosphere.  Will create a drink just for you, or order right off the menu. Pay for the experience though.< /text>

<user_id>116822121763024604987<//user_id><Date>1619673040770< /Date><Review>So disappointing. Made reservations over a month ago for a group of 6 visiting from FL. Showed up for our reservation (and was texting the person who handles the reservation line and he confirmed our reservation AND time to close). We show up and waited around for 5 minutes for them to get someone to help us - there was also a couple waiting outside to get in too but no one was helping them so they left. Then a guy finally comes to help us and tell us they “decided to close early and last call is right now.” Offered for us to make a reservation on another day, except we are on vacation. Didn’t apologize what so ever. Just a really unfortunate experience, and can’t recommend this spot. Find another speakeasy in Temecula or grab a bottle from a vineyard.</Review><gmap_id>0x80db7fbf3d400001:0x58f15d3f27893c8f</gmap_id>< Resp>

<Text>You are paying for an experience. Please do not get this gem confused with a commercial style bar. I absolutely love speakeasies. So first it has a secret door and everything, my first thought was THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. You will step into be 20s and wish to never leave. The decor is gorgeous and the music is mood setting. When you sit you will be  blessed to encounter Tristan!!! He is nothing less than perfection. He is beyond knowledgeable and does it so effortlessly without making you feel inept. I mean the man has got to be the most well informed bartender ever. He is not one of these guys throwing your drinks together and moving on to the next patron. EVERYONE is hanging onto his every word craving the stories behind each drink he is crafting. He is not your average bartender ppl and you will not be paying an average price. This place is pricey and for good reason. 13 dollars a drink sounds crazy until you actually walk in and see what you are getting. I'm a penny pincher and would save just to have this experience. You have to try this place out. Don't miss out. Once you come here you'll never see bars the same. It was like I was living the  prohibition experience. Must try drinks Dead man's chest ($18) Wild wood, and a classic Whiskey sour. Not that out of the bottle foolishness. This is my new go to for drinks. It really changed my entire drinking experience.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Called and made a reservation for five people. We were very excited to go based on reviews. Showed up and they told us that last call was early tonight and they couldn't seat us. Paid over $30 for our Uber to get there too. Very disappointed</text>< user_id>

<Text>My husband and I came for my bday back in February. Great drinks, great customer service.  Tonight was a very different experience.  My husband and I decided to come back and spend out big anniversary night back at Asperation room thinking we were gonna have a similar experience.  Boy were we wrong. We were sat at the  corner of the bar, ignored the entire evening,  told when I asked for extra olives for my martini they cannot do that even though I was planning on spending well over $200 at this bar. Forgot to put my order of steak fritz in. And after waiting well over an hour they tell us they forgot to put in our order and they are now out of steak. Instead they brings us out a pitiful sea bass to compensate.  When talking to the manager he just said drop his name next time we come in and he will take care of us. They took better care of the employee off duty then they did of us. We ended up leaving with me in tears  and extremely angry.  3 different couples to the left of me came and left with food and drinks before we even got our second drinks. When I called repeatedly to talk to the manager Kenneth in the morning my calls were repeatedly ignored. Being told every time he was on a phone call. The restaurant is run by children.  I have worked in customer service for 19 years. The treatment we received is disgusting,unexplainable and extremely disappointing. My husband and I drive far to come to Temecula.  Finding childcare so we can have a night out is few and far between and this is how my evening was spent. And did I mention they still charged us $50 for our drinks. There was literally no excuse for this kind of service and behavior<//Text>< gmapID>

Such a cool speakeasy vibe. I went here when they were hosting the Miracle pop-up. The bar was selected specifically to host this special event if that tells you anything. Can't say enough about the staff and the decor and the atmosphere. A must stop if you're in Temecula!</Text>

This gem is tucked away in Devilicous at the end of Old Town Temecula and you will not only be wowed by the quality of the drinks but the atmosphere makes it a place you must visit at least once. It's got a very cool speakeasy vibe and decor that really gives the place a unique atmosphere. We ordered The Old Man and The Sea ($14) which has a black sea salt on the rim and contains egg white. It's got a salty but sweet taste, not too bitter. The texture of the egg white is what makes it. Second drink, served in a fresh coconut is The Dead Man's Chest ($18) which is similar to a Mai Tai. They serve it with a dried pineapple ringlet, which completes the sweet and tropical taste of this drink. We have been here a couple times and it's best to get there early or make a reservation as it does fill up quickly on the weekends. We will be back soon!< /Text>

Our bartender was one of the greats. We tried two drinks from the menu and of course they tasted amazing. The tender asked us what we liked and then set a glass of something wonderful in front of us. The most impressive part of the night was we asked the the bartender to make something that would make us like Gin, since we absolutely detest it. What that man made was what I can only describe as apothicarian sorcery. Delicious apothicarian sorcery.< /text>

Deadmans chest definitely hit the spot, was really cool watching them make it, but it is strong definitely we sipping it but still got a really good buzz going,maybe more than a buzz lol, the pineapple and cherry added was really good too, had devil's on horseback as an appetizer and it really hit the spot, definitely recommend both< /Text>

I must say I love this trend toward cocktails as art. I have been to a few of this style of bar and they have all been great. The Apparition Room is doing a very good job as well. Had a great time, will definitely return often.< /review>

<Review>Incredible ambiance. Just the right amount of lighting, prohibition era style music, and beautiful things everywhere. Food and drinks were original, interesting, creative, and most of all delicious. Service was kind, cheerful, helpful, and attentive. Definitely a worthwhile experience.<//Review>< pictures>

So nice we had to do it twice....literally in one day! The service was great - they were personable and knowledgeable about their craft. Scare Bleu may be my new favorite drink. Campfire Sour is a work of art. And, deep fried olives? Surprisingly delicious considering I don’t eat much fried food. Ambiance is fun, and styled like a real speakeasy. I’ll go back if I’m ever in the area again.<//text>

<review>Insanely cool.  Just don't order "ordinary" drinks.  Stick with their menu and live a little!  Great for trying something different!  AND be quiet and respectful to other customers.  No one cares about your personal life ..... it's a "SPEAK EASY" for a reason.  If you want to be loud, go to Yardhouse or something.  Maybe Fridays since they went out of business.< /review>< pictures>

Such a fun experience. First off you need to make reservations to see if space is available cause it is a small space. Love the decor and the seating is even comfortable. Shout out to Joel our bartender. He did an amazing job of crafting our cocktails. Will definitely go again.< /Text>

Great service and amazing drinks. If you're not sure what you want just let them know and they'll make you something based on your preferences. Always great times at Apparitions.<//review>

<Text>Always a great experience. Hard to get in as a walk-in so ensure you make reservations. My girlfriend loves the dead man's chest drink. If you are looking for a place to pre-game before going to one of the near by clubs this is a must. The drinks are strong, the bar itself is nicely decorated, the bartenders know their craft and are very friendly and polite. Don't like what's on the menu? No worries.. these bartenders  are chemist, they will make you anything.< /Text><gmapID>0x80db7fbf3d400001:0x58f15d3f27893c8f</gmapID><Resp>None<//Resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

<Review>Cool speakeasy  make reservations on weekends as its limited space.

Parking - Its Old town Temecula so limited parking on busy hours or weekend.

Location - Towards the end on Old Town but in the prime area closer to all the happening bars.

Venue - Very clean and new looking with a good size room.

Drinks - On point with a good selection to choose from.

Prices  - Going rates so competitive.

Overall great place and worth checking out.< /Review>< rate>

This place is such a treat. The whole experience is great, the drinks are interesting and well balanced and the bar tenders are attentive without being all over you. Got a little history lesson with my absinthe (which they prepare the way it's supposed to be done....so fun) thanks to the guy who appears to be the head bartender. Do yourself a favor and do it right by dressing up and making a thing out of it....there is technically a dress code which I wish they would enforce a bit more since the floral sun dress and tshirt crowd kills the vibe hard</text>

Simply put: do not go here. They made us stand outside for 15 minutes past our reservation for no discernible reason (no one exited and our seats were ready). They also said we couldn't talk to our friends who were also at the bar but that "maybe we could go over one at a time to say hi." What? We sat down and waited 30 minutes before we finally caught the bartenders attention for a drink. He was rude, dismissive and unhelpful. We have been to many, many upscale bars and speakeasies and have never experienced such a poor level of service. The interior was cheap and the drinks overpriced. We will never be back.<//text>

Apparition Room is an absolute gem in every way. From the design aesthetic, to the amazing Bartenders  (Mo, Tristan, and Matt), to the masterfully-crafted cocktails, to a great  Bar Back (Adam), and an awesome pair of proprietors... this place is one of the best this world of ours has to offer! Due to what I do for a living, I’ve been exposed to the world’s best mixologists and beverage programs. And I’d put Apparition Room against any other place and put money on them. They’re awesome! And the food is great, too!</review>

Tristan, our bartender, was so hospitable and knowledgeable, and very creative. My wife enjoyed Old Fashioned's, which Tristan made differently each time. I had whiskey drinks, which were excellent. The "Devils on Horseback" appetizer was delicious; and the Charcuterie & Cheese board was one of the best we've ever had.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80db7fbf3d400001:0x58f15d3f27893c8f</gmapID></record>

Drinks are decent, staff are pretentious and rude. Don’t ask the bartenders for recommendations unless you are in the mood to be talked down to. They force you to wait to enter the bar even if you have a reservation...I assume to try and create a false sense of exclusivity. We will not be returning.<//text>

Yummy Mexican Ice-Cream and snacks.
Very clean & tidy.
People who work here are Very hospitable. They takes time to listen everytime to make sure of my order as I am still not familiar with the different snacks & mixed ice-cream items. And more than anything, they make super yummy Mangonada & Alotay (don't know if I write it correctly!) this is our ice-cream parlor 💖
Great job team👍</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY0SeqDMEaHyNQ5zPIKPZRPHGK1WaQKPRQFVvf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcQGmmcaZiqRAdnpLiWTk7sHUN-uUBEefEgY3w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2uJXH6ponuoVuAVd4Fzry8X2QkDywT3qj2JRc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZQ25EMHGs0T79M1xRvkvOeHbwFyuNfLw16NWK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4ggkGozWOjMU1msqlM5tYjgoZLKi3EbbWOHIP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1B0aYIGevUNsUrLt-Yl_AY-nHu3j_B-AWigwJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7lCmMojYGclgH6nTCdWYryAtedwEA4o6cJVgv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeNNufW2kuJumwVnDkkmDe36vOWC6QH8ZgoOb_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9DVbJF-4h6WWHPIk2YgjTOVbS6g2VkrkRWmMm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM26uNQzmE1jumdp-41UwxxZk-IDgUMvkBJ1YDI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM81YhnQHQyoRIgRGzuasvQJ38RVvtxi5O5uJdX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBIhbTtFFBWwBXm9CGWjq-zjIFhJTnO6IDhs-W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I have been here before for ice-cream and popsicles which were awesome. Those are great! As for their raspado game... not so much. I’ve tried their vanilla raspado and that wasn’t tasty either. If you come stick to popsicles and the ice-cream.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I've been meaning to review this spot. After visiting several of these chains, I must say they're not all created equally. This specific spot would be mine and my son's favorite. They definitely offer a variety of flavors and you can tell they take pride in what they do. Other spots seem sloppy and careless compared to this location. Definitely would recommend this place. Wouldn't recommend a specific item, just try something new each time you go. You won't regret it.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Awesome place and fair prices, I ordered a couple of jugs of Horchata for my son's birthday which they require a day in advance notice FYI. You pay a rental deposit which you get back when you return the jugs although bring your own ladle because they don't supply that strangely unless they just forgot to give me a couple when I picked up my order.</text>

Mi obsesión reciente: heladerías y paleterías. 😉

If you think that the Mexican culinary experience only includes tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, etc., you’re definitely missing out. Delicious ice cream, popsicles, drinks, and snacks galore. The variety of flavors is to die for. Fresh homemade stuff. Lots of fruit and nut chunks. Excellent customer service to boot.< /text>

Good service and pizza. The woman working there was very nice, and helped me find an outlet to charge my phone. There are two outlets one behind the bench in front of the counter and another one over to the side past the counter.< /review>

Great place to go for dinner or lunch, tucked in a little strip mall.  I ordered pizza and they made it to order.  The pizza itself was good and the location really can't be beat!  Plus it was less than 5 minutes away from my hotel!  I'd come back!< /text>

Great little joint that makes pizza slices to order.  The New York style pizza was fresh and delicious.  I stayed at a near by hotel and was able to run back with the pizza and it was still piping hot!  I'd come back again!</text>

<Review>The pizza was edible, nothing great. Glad I had a Groupon because it definitely wasn't worth $20. The worker, I assume owner, was a one man show. It was supposed to open at noon but he didn't show up until 12:05. You'd think someone would be there prepping at least 30 minutes before opening.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

If it was sketchier I would have expected the food to be better (as is the case for the hole in the wall places that look scary & have great food). While the food didn't disappoint it didn't leave me wanting to go back while  I was visiting. Thin crust pizza. Meh.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dc01ee6ca259fd:0xfba47ce17dcfc0cd</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Really loved the place. Will definitely become a regular here. Coming from a true new Yorker this pizza did not disappoint or the calzone. The staff was very friendly specially this girl named Isis she was running around and smiling the whole time 10/10< /Text>

Pizza was good. Good sauce. Nice and garlicky. I'm pretty sure the girl that took my order, then went back and made my pizza. Thus why some people may have complained about slow service. My service wasn't slow, but I could see how it could be if they were busy and only one person was working. Worth a try IMO.< /Text>

<Text>It's pizza.  Close to the beach.  Nothing special.  Nothing bad.  If you're looking for a unique local experience this isn't it.  But if you just want a quick fair price lunch, this is the ticket.<//Text><Date>1525278870377< /Date>< resp>

The crust was obviously frozen previously. Sauce had zero flavor. Never again; will head down to Luigi's next time instead.<//Text>

Or take the chance and leave another horrible review after you experience what most people do your choice.

< Review>
As I walked into the restaurant I made obvious eye contact with the cashier directly behind the register. I smiled and approached to order, to which she immediately ran back into the kitchen as if I was invisible or just plain hideous. I waited patiently at the register until she finally came back. I greeted her with a happy smile. Before I could even open my mouth and say what I would like to order, she said that the ovens were off and that they only had 2 slices of pizza left. She said this with such a quickness I was shocked and confused. I didn't have time to process this at first. I am not sure what she thought I was in the store for with my group of friends, of course 2 slices was just a bit small for us. The most insulting part of this was that it was only 7:20pm and that they wouldn't be closing till 8pm. Why are the ovens off close to an hour before they close? They were trying to close early. We were all young once and yes it's great to have fun, but please update your hours that ovens close at 7pm so that this doesn't happen to another unfortunate soul. I just wanted some food after a hard day. It was my turn to treat my coworkers, who are also my best friends. They seemed like they were okay with it, but I felt terrible. I know eventually I'll get over this, but it just sucks. I had money in hand and ready to pay. It was a waste of time. Please help your employees understand hours, or perhaps the clock was set ahead as a prank. If so I can not blame them, but can someone please update the clock. Thank you.<//Review>

Do not order the burgers or lasagna. The sauce makes Chef-Boyardee in a can seem like a delicacy. The mushroom swiss burger reminded me of an MRE. Rock hard, super thin, over cooked, and almost as good as space-food. The antipasta salad was good, but incredibly small. Heck, even the soda was flat. Honestly, I do not like leaving bad reviews, but I feel even worse letting someone else make the mistake of eating here. Sorry Ocean's, take pride in your food and customer service if you want positive feedback. Cheers!< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>This place purposely do NOT answer calls after 8pm and put you on hold 10 mins before 8pm and never come back so they don't have to make anymore pizzas before they close.  We've had so many problems with this pizza place.  They are NOT worth it and filled with bunch of lazy people.  Their phone service is through "Magic Jack".  Call it after 8pm and you'll get the message " the Magic Jack customer you have called is unavailable to take your call".  This place don't deserve your business.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Terrible service - no customer focus. If you call, they put you on hold never to return for your order.  If you call back, Magic Jack phone service is busy for the rest of the night.  Why are they in business?  Food's poor and service is bad - save your money for someone who appreciates it!<//review>< Pictures>

The pizza was poor, the service was slow at best, and not a single person working there seemed interested in anything but joking with each other. Multiple people in the restaurant were upset with how slow orders were taking, and we were generally displeased by how the food tasted. Even managed to get our order wrong. The atmosphere was alright, with a cool beach hangout style, but doesn't make up at all for the poor quality of the place.<//review>

Just arrived at condo on beach. Botched order and Uber eats (delivery source) said he was on his way nearly 30 minutes after scheduled arrival after a ridiculously long and as he said insultingly 20-minute wait at the restaurant...”Rarely I have seen employees less interested in working or who clearly could care less about doing an efficient job...And the place wasn’t busy at all! Wow!”
Don’t order from this place!<//Text>

Horrible service. Waited ten minutes at the register while a couple of patrons said rude things about everyone walking by. Finally walked out because we were never going to be served. As we walked out the only employee we ever saw strolled out from the back leisurely, I'm sure she was on her phone or doing something else not work related. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.<//review>

It's been quite a while since I have been to a business where I felt as though I was inconveniencing the staff by placing an order.
The food is okay but for the price it is not worth it.
Thank you for the reminder, I won’t be back.<//review>

This place had the worst service I have ever endured at a food place. I wish a no star review was available, because i sincerely wish that anyone who sees this just avoids this place. Both servers were terrible, i tipped 4 bucks for some pizza before the meal snce that was their system and the waitress (did no waiting) literally took pur order and walked away. No drinks were offered, even when paid for. When she did come around to getting our drinks, she placed them on the counter where one orders and said ,"your drinks are ready", and walked away. Making a friend walk to the counter from our dining table to get the drinks? At this point I knew this couln't get better, as the male server was so extremely rude to other customers giving THEM business. HE DIDN'T BRING ANYONE THE DRINKS THEY ORDERED AND WHEN HE DID HE WOULD SIMLY HOLLER ACROSS THE DINING ROOM AND ASK IF THE CUSTOMER WANTED ICE BY SIMPLY YELLING "ICE?!" Please do not go here and ruin your day or the day of your friends and family.< /review></record></dataset><record>

We waited almost an hour for our pepperoni pizza because they forgot about us. When the pizza did arrive, it was soggy and dripping grease. Not really worth the price.</Review>

Absolutely the best Tortas. They raised the price up to about $10+ but still worth it. I go there seldom now due to that but still worth it. Pan dulce is always fresh too!

<review>Love this place! Every time I come here, the tortas are the same: lots of meat, good price and makes me full. I haven't tried anything else there but the tortas are full of flavor and spicy, which I enjoy.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7bML71dzt1Ah-gdBLOpvpH5lOwslipXdk3am6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZbcFkvQxdDYeSnU2N-xQDCbUMDmmLepHESVvG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>TORTAS!!! Nom, nom, nom!

The Torta's here are huge! Apart from the generous portions all the ingredients tasted fresh. The tomatoes, avocados and even the bread. So far I tried the Milanesa, Cubana, Azada and the Hawaiana. I am delighted  to report that none of them were disappointing!

Then, there are the rest of the goodies in the store. The lines can get quite long, but they move along fairly quickly. I also ended up getting a Custard Horn, Mango Flan and a ChocoFlan cake.....YUM! None of the desserts were overly sweet. They were just so very well balanced and the chocolate tasted like it was genuine Coca, or maybe a decent bittersweet dark chocolate. I just wish this place had more seating and was in a slightly better location. It can be a bit challenging to order, I got the impression that the entire staff speaks broken English or very little English. The selection of baked goods here is immense, can't wait to try all of them!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>The Food
When a friend sends you a picture of a giant sandwich and says "I would like a review". You bet I'll go and get the giant sandwich and do a review. I didn't know Mexico Bakery was a place until that day, and definitely did not know there's a giant sandwich. The giant sandwich refers to torta, which in this context is a sandwich. I order their combinada (combination) with 2 carnes (2 meats) with asada (beef) and cubana (cuban). But there's more, it comes with meat chili (sloppy joe?), egg, avocado, and an array of vegetables. When I say the sandwich was big, I mean it was as big as my face. I can't even fit it into my mouth. Even though it is like $16, it was not a bad deal. The only gripe I have was that the beef was dry and tough to chew, otherwise it was pretty good. The bakery has a variety of other selections, from pastries to desserts. Would like to return to check out their other items.

The Miscellaneous
The bakery is in a quite spacious plaza, with plenty of parking. The inside itself is not super big, but still decent sized. There seemed to be a small amount of seating before, but of course now is all take out. They have a straightforward menu you can order from, but many of the selection on display is not on the menu itself. The combine selection from the menu and display is quite extensive with many items. The prices are not bad, pretty reasonable.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrKF023BvMLEFS4MF8Nru7Y2ngZnPcS8EzKqZZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT_ij2_a_F6_Wy0t6yD9XaM0zjUh7Ige1D4t1b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fcd448e1531ff:0x11108a1ef781c47f<//gmap_id></record>

<text>My friend and I were impressed with Mexico Bakery! We decided to order Cubana and Jamon. I highly recommend trying both! Oh my God! It was unbelievable! I haven't tried anything tastier than that sandwiches! Bread, meat, and vegetables were so tasty with a flavorful sauce! My friend was so happy that we found this place!

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>I have been going to both this location and the other location (Santa Clara Street) for many years. Although this place is a bakery, it's well known for having excellent tortas. When I go, I usually either get a glazed donut or a churro to accompany my main dish. Now, if you fancy tortas, this is definitely the place to go. One, they are reasonably priced. Two, they give you a great amount of meat. To be honest, they give enough that you can share with a significant other. For my taste, I go with either the traditional carne asada, or I really get a little fancier and get milanesa. You will not go wrong with either. Finally, as of late, they have added other traditional taqueria specialities (e.g. tacos, quesadillas, burritos), but I don't come here for those.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHzmVnllaQr48qOskFs-cReEdk2gl_7GXnWy2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiTF5zi9-kHuVt43UVVXf89-GPrLJZpkjv1-2B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7JjcAuRP1L4Gj16OfVwcYg0KXzAma6-dNXl9S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSa7aLwSixo7D6SwU02j3paneHFQ7RvH7ol-IN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtTODjV409B_eTev4gNSDRWnZAouE3Xn1FNT9l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7L9R98h_3I1SxO_VOXR43lrNm27lFUV-pvbPv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Just get the baked goods, don't order any hot foods. I ordered a chicken torta and chicken burrito from there and not only did they get both orders wrong, but they tasted completely bland and oily. Donuts are great though.</Review>

<Review>Get your fresh bread here also other bakeries and do they make a giant sandwich known as a "Torta"

I got a friend chicken sandwich and it surely filled me up.

< review>
First time trying it out. Been wanting to try this place for awhile and i finally did today. We tried the asada torta and i liked it a lot. My sister said it was just okay. The torta is huge thou so either go there when you're really hungry or share one... definitely would try another one next time.

Upgrade: i think i found my favorite!!! We tried the pork and cubana. Oh boy... Everyone who said they love cubana. I totally agree. The pork was a lil dry. My sis said wait for like 5-10 minutes to let the juices out a bit then consume.... yummm</review>

<response>None</response><review>I don't know what happened to this bakery.  It used to be my favorite bakery and I am sad to say that I am only giving them one star.  Their bread and tortas are amazing!  I used to order cakes from and I stopped because they were getting sloppy.  I decided to give them a second chance this past week and I was so disappointed.  I would not recommend this place if you are placing an order for a cake.  I showed them a picture of the design and it basically seems like a five year old did it.  The cake itself was messed up and it seemed like someone poke something through the icing.  When we cut the cake, there were literally two very thick layers of icing and a very very thin layer of cake.  I will not be coming to this bakery for cakes.</review><GmapID>0x808fcd448e1531ff:0x11108a1ef781c47f< /GmapID>< Rating>

The food is very good, but a bit greasy / heavy. If that's what you're looking for, I'd give this closer to a 4 out of 5. The desserts are quite good. Specifically, I have come back many times to get the chocoflan. It's a flan and a chocolate cake in one. The juice from the flan mixes into the chocolate cake, making it very moist.< /Text>

Excellent fruit cake. Always busy and that gives you good feeling that the food is fresh. They bake most of their food right in view of the customers.</Text>

I get pan dulce from here often. But since Covid and face masks have become a thing, the employees don't wear them correctly and or they take them off to talk to each other on the otherwise of the plexy glass. Bread 5stars but bc of the faces masks 4stars< /review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>So despite a few hiccups in service the food is  above average. I ordered a super burrito (chicken but got steak instead, oh well). They actually season their meat and cook it just right. The  burritow huge and I had to ask them to rewrap it. No big deal there. The only complaint was there was this crazy person I side asking everyone for two dollars and they didn't ask her to leave. The bathrooms were horrendous too. But I still give four stars because the food makes up for most of that. They would have a great restaurant if they just fixed some of the minor issues. Also, just being picky, but I wish the tortillas were freshly made.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Was craving some late night flan, this place stays open late and has a lot of variety. Service was all over the place. Walked in and was not helped right away. Started browsing the selection and another customer came in and somebody came up to help them. I thought of maybe they didn't see me walk in first and waited to be helped. Another customer walked in and again, was helped before me. Then the cashier walked away and an older lady asked if I needed help. I told her yes, then she walked away with out saying she would help us or not. I patiently waited and she returned now ready to help. 10 minutes have passed at this point. I ordered a few items. After my first 6 items I walked to the next section to let them know my following choises. The woman walked away assuming I was finished with out asking of that would be all. She did this twice before I was done ordering. Was rung up and asked to sign, but wait, there was no pen to sign with. Awkward. Took whole 20minutes in and out. I rarely write bad reviews but after tasting the flan I was craving, I was very disappointed. It was at least two days old and has been frozen. The bottom of the flan was tough and chewy. Did I mention there was at least 5 employees working? I don't understand how service could be this bad.<//Text>

Mexico Bakery popped up as the first result when searching for Mexican Bakeries in San Jose on Yelp. I decided to give it a try as it had a near perfect rating from almost 900 reviews. It is located in the eastern edge of the city so its not in the best part of town, but the location is not as sketchy as some of the other areas on the east side. There is a small parking lot in the front so parking is not an issue. At the peak lunch hour on a Saturday the place seemed pretty full with a line 5 people deep in front of the ordering station which is too your left when you enter. The baked goods and cakes are in the long display to your right. I did not see any anyone behind these displays so I skipped these items and got in line. I decided to get the Torta Milanesa ($8.50) which is fried breaded beef steak, to-go with everything. The lady behind the cash register spoke decent English so I did not face any issues during ordering.

After ordering I had to wait for around 15 minutes before I got my order. Here you get an order number but unfortunately the numbers are called out in Spanish so like me if you can’t speak Spanish it is a bit of a hassle. The good news is that orders are processed in order that they are received so if you track the person in front of you, you would know when you are up. It would be a lot easier if they simply called out numbers in Spanish and English, but that is too much to ask here.

I got a huge and I mean huge torta which had almost 3 layers of milanesa. This had to be the largest torta that I’d had in my life. The one word to describe it would be terrific. The only negative that I can think of is that it was a little heavy on the salt and it had a little too much Avocado for my taste so next time I’ll skip the Avocado. Price wise it was slightly more than what you would pay for a burger in Five Guys so I’d say that it was in line with what you would pay for a comparable item in the area. Looking at the overall package or service, quality and value for money, Mexico Bakery definitely has me down as a fan. Hopefully I will figure out how to order the baked goods and try some of those and update my review at that time.</Review>

Gravity pulls me back to Mexico Bakery whenever I'm nearby.  I love their tortas, flan, juice, and of course the many desserts!  They often hand out free samples of warm deliciousness!  I've tried the veggie torta (Queso) and the Milanesa.  Both were excellent!  Since I love them so much I've tried tortas many other places, and so far nowhere else can create Tortas that compare to Mexico Bakery.< /text>

They have the best tortas ever!
But it's old school Mexico style service , frost come first served! Be patient and respectful it's worth the wait.
But if you got white boy mentality " serve me now!" I suggest you go to Subway and have it your way!<//Review>

<text>busy place. need to cover the fresh baked pastries better. There are locations where the pastries are never covered against flies. There needs to be better lighting in the pastries cases. This would also deter the flies from  flying in those cases and maybe easier for the employees to keep them out.
Better involved staff members. There needs to be more clear English speaking employees that can helped move lines along and help customer services</text><rating>3< /rating><response>None<//response>< date>

<review>My favorite Mexican bakery in the Bay Area. The pastries taste great, the people are friendly and the prices are reasonable. The pastries are ALWAYS fresh and baked daily. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because the location can use a little TLC and some light cleaning. If you are interested in trying some Mexican desserts you definitely have to try their popular Conchitas ( I prefer the vanilla flavor but the chocolate ones are good too).<//review>< pictures>

The bread we got was very fresh and tasted delicious
I want to go back and try their food and cakes
Parking in the front is tough so I recommend parking on the side of the building</Text>

Best place ever to get Mexican bread!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍 They have so many variety of pan dulce. They also have the best tortas. The customer service is awesome, they are kind and the baker always gives out free samples. Will definitely come back. 😋< /Text>

Got both pollo & asada tortas, so delicious. Fresh bread, lots of meat, cheese, & toppings. We also added extra mayo. Splashed down some cinnamon rice agua fresca for the sweet tooth.</text>

This bakery has gone from being the to go bakery to being the last resource. The costumer service, food quality, pan dulce, and pastries quality have definitely taking an impact, not sure if the business is under new owner or management but. This place is struggling, I believe the only reason why it gets pack is the fact that is the only actual bakery in that heavy commuted street.< /Review>

This spot has food like; tacos; burritos; tortas and so on. They also offer pressed juices. One of which I was able to taste I believe it was called vampiro. It is a bakery so you find delicious tres leches cakes, flans, jellos and more yummy treats. This place does tend to get fairly busy but we hardly had to wait.< /Review>

The wait can be a little long, but well worth it.

And of course, it's a Mexican bakery so they have amazing pastries and other tasty desserts.< /Text>< Rating>

< Review>
Never get a cake from here. The first time we got a cake for my moms birthday it had mold inside & they did nothing about it & acted like it wasn't their problem. Second time we got a cake for my sister & one of female workers was giving my mom attitude over having to take the small cake out of the box to write "Happy Birthday Nancy " & then had to wait for the longest time for them to make more piping gel when the lady ran out of the color she was already using. After my mom took the cake home she noticed it said "HBD Nancy" in the ugliest hand writing. Not going back.</Review>

Absolutely, the best tortas for the price! Very tasty 😋 the best part is that desert is just as satisfying if you can eat that much.  A must visit for Mexican bread lovers!<//Text>

<Review>The Mexican pastries are exceptional. I would say it's probably one of the best in this area.   From their selection in pan dulce to their cold press juice and their atolez they have selection to chose from.  You can also call your order in this way you don't have to wait too long.  The down side is that they do take a while to help you. But they are pleasant people< /Review>< name>

<review>The line is very very long and the workers here are super disrespectful towards the clients. It seems as though they do not want to work there. They need to hire people who actually have enthusiasm to work with PEOPLE. However the dessert and bread is very good here. The only thing that makes this terrible is the WORKERS themselves. Hire more people to attend the amount of people coming in too.</review>< gmap_id>

<Review>More than just a local bakery, they are known more for their huge, delicious tortas. About $5 each but they are worth it. Family owned and operated so the people behind the counter are usually super nice. All around a great local spot.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Where do I begin?!! I love the tortas, especially the cubana. The sandwiches are made to order. Huge!! Fully loaded. Normally I would split with someone for a torta that size, but I always almost finish it myself, and save the rest for later.. They do not skimp on the avocado either like other places do.
Pastries: I have tried almost every thing and have loved it all. I do however recommend the chocoflan. So yum!
Service: there's one line for everything. But they are pretty quick in trying to help everyone. If the line starts to form, the workers in the back comes out to help out.</Review>

Always like to get my conchas here they are the best!!! The owner is very friendly and gives out free hot bread at night.  Very nice friendly and courteous service here.  And the tortas are one of their specialties very very good!!! Love the cakes and their chocoflan.< /Review>

Fresh & Delicious! Have only had the Pastries. I gave it 3 stars becuase of cleanliness or else it would of been 5. Seating area was a mess. Im not sure if i walked in after a rush or crowd but if I was going to eat there i probably would have left. But it was about 10pm and place was still very busy. I bought about a dozen pastries all different. Reasonably Priced. The cake with pinapple on top is the BEST!!!!</review>

Tortas are delicious! We come to SJ just to eat here it is that good! I get the carne asada and it is so big we have to take some home.  The bread is fresh made and all the ingredients are fresh.</Review>

Amazing place for breads and Tortas. Had the Milanesa Torta, the thing is massive for only 8 bucks. Couldn't even finish half. They don't skimp on avocado as it is loaded with it and they definitely don't skimp on the meats. A must try if you like Tortas and Mexican breads.</review>

Biggest Baddest Tortas in town! I highly recommend trying the "Milanesa" or "Cubana". It keeps me and my Gf coming back. Amazing Family run business. 5 stars hands down.<//review>

Ordered a birthday cake 2 weeks in advance .Picked the cake up all the way across town driving 25 minutes . While serving we noticed it wasnt leche cake . We called the day after the party and they told me to expect a call back.No call. The next day, I call back and talk to the "manager" a lady who was really unprofessional. She said we need to show them a slice of the cake.How is that possible , when it was specifically for a party? Not like we had left overs . After her telling me to"hold up", etc.. mumbling how they wont help me out.. I tell them they lost a customer and she responds "Oh okay thats fine" to the president of this company,hope you find better people to work for you , or youre losing your business .Not to mention, its a little filthy inside I will be reporting to the health dept.< /Review>

Best Mexican bread!! My favorite is the conchas, ojos, elotes, polvoron they are delicious and fresh everyday. They also served gigantic tortas that are full of meat with jalapeños, avocado and cheese.< /Review>

Came here for lunch after some Valley Fair shopping.

1. Torta cubana, 6.75
~Pretty good. Everything worked well together, especially the sausage, egg, and guac.

2. Torta ham, 6.25
~Mediocre. I got this one on accident since they had duplicate order numbers. It's basically the cubana minus the fried egg and sausage.

Service was rather disappointing. I had to wait quite a while to get a to-go box since there was only a single person making tortas, although someone eventually saw me standing there and offered to help.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Had the Torta Asada. It had plenty of ingredients; lot's of meat and avocados  (loved those two the most). The meat was delicious very savory, and the avocado was good (tasted "fresh" to me). The only downside is it can get pretty messy to eat so I wouldn't want to eat that in my car. The jalapenos were't spicy,but tasted pretty good.<//Review>

<text>I hear a rumbling in my tummy! Uh oh....where should I go?

I chose Bakery Mexico! I was sold on the "less than $5" meal since I was rolling on a budget to save for future trips and shopping expenses.

Among all the helpful tips from friends, you have two choices between their famous tortas: Milanesa or Cubano. Well, my SO and I ordered both to share each other's half and try what the other sandwich was like. My-oh-my!! I love both! I can't pinpoint any favoritism to which I enjoyed more. I found that both had incredible amount of meat, packed with avocado, tomato, eggs, hot dogs, etc. The juicy meat with all the dripping oil sliding down my hand, I almost had a heart attack! Their tortas was to die for! I couldn't finish the rest of mine, so I took it home to eat for later.

I'm not sure what else is there to say, other than, come here for their tortas! You won't be disappointed. The size of my two hands combined was the size of their tortas. Very filling and greasy but worth it! They also have pastry goodies, but I haven't had the chance to try any of it. I might come back for their slices of cake or cookies, because they priced it dirt cheap too!

Not bad. Not bad at all. I'm coming back!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The carne asada torta was amazing. The guacamole & carne asada were generously applied. The jalapenos weren't spicy, and added a nice sutble flavor. The horchata wasn't too sweet, well made. My only qualm is that all of the tables were pretty dirty. We had to wipe it down ourselves. Tables aside, the tortas were amazing. I would recommend this place to my friends.<//Text>

Really nice tortas. The place is packed most of the time. There is not enough variety in sweet mexican bread. You will definetely not find sweet corn bread, pan de elote, or proper mexican cakes. The tortas are ok.< /text>

(Translated by Google) This place is very good if you like bread like me. Although they also make cakes and other things. The only thing I do not like is waiting so long for you to attend, but it's only sometimes.

(Translated by Google) Disappointed of this place, I made my order of 2 cakes and they only gave me one I had to ask again for the other one and it was there when those who work in the place shouted because a rat went through there inside.
When I received my cake and arrived home I saw that it was given without meat. 👎🏼 I called them to tell them and when they answered me they did not give me the opportunity to tell them and they just told me to wait a moment for the ahortia I attended they spent 10 min. And they forgot that they left me on the phone waiting. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼

(Original)
Decepcionada  de este lugar, hize mi orden de 2 tortas y solo me dieron una tuve que volver a pedir la otra y estaba ahi cuando los que trabajan en el lugar gritaron porque una rata atraveso ahi adentro.
Cuando recibi mi torta y llegue a casa vi que me la dieron sin carne. 👎🏼 Les llame para decirles y cuando me contestaron no me dieron la oportunidad de decirles y solo me dijeron espere un momento ahortia la atiendo pasaron 10 min. Y se les olvido que me dejaron en el telefono esperando. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very good bread, and atole, I have been at 5 or 6 am and there is only one person serving customers and usually the line to attend you is huge. And the ladies who attend are always rushing you, you have not just asked them for something and they already say "and what else". And I don't know if they have changed personnel, but lately the tamales are not good, they taste strange.

(Original)
Muy buen pan, y atole, he ido a las 5 o 6 am y solo esta una persona atendiendo a los clientes y por lo regular la fila para que te atiendan es enorme. Y las señoras que atienden siempre te estan apresurando todavia no acabas de pedirles algo  y ya te dicen "y que mas". y no se si ya cambiaron de personal pero ultimamente los tamales no estan buenos saben raro.< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Saturday December 26 10:30 pm we ordered approximately 15 cakes, arriving home we discovered that we were missing 2 Cubans, we called and they said we would return for them we returned and still the wrong order, raw card, not jalapeños etc.
The service has always been good but today they passed.
