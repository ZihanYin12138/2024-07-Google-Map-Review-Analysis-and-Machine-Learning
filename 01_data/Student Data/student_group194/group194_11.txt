There were multiple issues at the location. They only had one person working the registers practically the entire time I was there. There was a line four customers deep when I arrived and got progressively longer after I ordered. There was only one person on the grill, who also left their duties to help with the blizzards and the fountain drink machine that had run out of ice. I ordered food and blizzards and had to change my food choice because they did not have any hot dogs. Although the blizzards were made well, they melted by the time my food was ready. An overall bad experience.</text>

I go to this location almost once a week whether it's for the food or their amazing ice cream, and I'm never disappointed. It can be a little busy at times, but they always managed to get everyone's orders out in a timely manner.<//review>

< Review>
The employees were nice but the service was horrible. I ordered a blizzard and a corn dog and ended up waiting 17 minutes for it. Not only was the corn dog not even warm but the middle was cold-like it had just thawed out. From the time i stepped in line to order til the time i got my food, it had been 27 minutes. I had been here only one other time and remember the service being slow so this recent experience did nothing to change my opinion.</Review>

For my first time at any DQ, this experience was terrible. Workers looked like they did not want to be there. The guy who was in front in register gave me attitude and would take a break after a few customers to talk and laugh with the other workers. The girl who made me my blizzards messed up on every item and one of them contained a hair. GROSS. My brother ordered a meal and they got that wrong too. He didn't eat that night thank you DQ. I think I got food poisoning tbh. Wait time is long and terrible for simple orders. NEVER going there again.They need fast and motivated people.</review>

It was mine and my sisters first time going here and we were pretty excited to go and try it out and see what the hype was about. Keep in mind it’s our first time going. My sister very politely asked the cashier (on the receipt is says Veronica G ) if the raspberry bliss was good or had she tried it and the cashier very rudely responded back and said idk and shrugged her shoulders that is very poor customer service. I work in fast food and the 2 1/2 yrs I’ve never answered a customer that way very unprofessional. Never going back after bad service.<//text>

Worst experience ever. Gave my order and waited 30 minutes watching every one after me get theirs. When I approached the person working who is a young man he asked me what I was missing and I told him the entire order he asked me to repeat it at which point I said now I don’t have time and he did not know how to give me a refund so I left with nothing. It’s not all his fault the two girls working left him with a busy store. I need my refund.</Text>

Most disrespectful Manager I've encountered. Rebecca is her name. My shake was either not blended correctly or too warm and I asked if they could reblend it. I was immediately met with hostility and rude attitude. Rebecca shunned me away like I wasnt welcome. I walked back in afterwards to wash my hands or get napkins from the shake running down the cup and Rebecca again shunned me away saying I couldn't use the restroom. Just such a bitter experwhen we came for something sweet. No stars.<//text>

<review>I could write two short stories from my experiences at this location, but I'll keep this short.

I enjoy their ice cream, it's the same as the rest. Plenty of parking and open late.

Now, normally I don't care about service, but this place has shown me that sometimes it matters.

In short, they seem to always have a mix of workers: one is competent, friendly & helpful, and the other is usually a complete moron (I don't cast aspersions lightly).
***This is during the evening shifts.***

May you never get your order taken by one of the dodos.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1565015843098, 'text': "Hi Eric, we appreciate your feedback.

<Review>Every employee at this location should know if this Dairy Queen has a senior discount. It should not be up to a manager--who may not be present--to approve a senior discount. Nearly all Dairy Queens offer this discount, as does Wendy's, Taco Bell, Del Taco, Carl's Jr., IHOP, and many, many others.</Review></record>

You think it would be a nice chill spot, cool inside and relaxing but its never cool, usually long lines and a little pricey. I want to like it so much more than I do, but they seem to fall a little short everytime i go there.</review>

For the price you pay, the customer service, quality and quantity of food really is not great at all. $4 for a very small burger. McDonald's mcdoubles which are 2 for 3 is way bigger, better and cheaper! The ice cream cones are better at McDonald's also!  I could have tolerated the food and the price but the customer service needs alot of improvement big time. Rude staff. Will not be visiting this or any other location. I grew up in Canada  so was really looking  forward to a good  DQ experience.</text>

It's a good place to eat. Food quality is decent and the ice cream is delicious. There is one problem, and it might be a tiny problem, but there's a female employee that has a little bit of an attitude. Get rid of her and it would have been 5 stars.< /review>

<Review>I love the fact that it doesn't matter which dairy Queen you go to their slow but they're all equally slow they give great product but still slow but we did go there about 9 p.m. and there is a huge line and they did but one order at a time I mean I guess that's good for being freshly made and everything but I think we have a line out the door you need to go a little faster< /Review>< time>

There was a miscommunication with our order and they handled the dispute with agression. The tension that came about from their service made my grandmother upset and me uncomfortable. Their ice cream was good, but I probably won't be returning.< /Text>

<review>Friendly staff, but the parking lot (no drive thru) was shady. I was stopped by a homeless person asking for money and a church person asking for donations. When did Blizzards get so expensive?? I can't see myself paying $5+ for a medium Blizzard again, anytime soon. It doesn't surprise me that there are so few in the LA/Orange County border area when prices are that high. I drove 21 miles to get to this one (my closest).<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

If you call over there can get directions they don't seem to know how to get there it's a nice place it is the people that work there they just didn't understand where we were coming from so that's why they had trouble with directions ice cream and to search they have oh my God they're so good a really good place to get ice cream<//Text>

They took our order quickly. Afterwards, other customers came in, but all 3 workers were gone for like 2 minutes leaving this fiiiiiiine guy standing around awkwardly. We made eye contact a few times, it was awesome.</review>

They are almost as expensive as 31 flavors Baskin-Robbins. I don't care how good the ice cream is nothing is worth 4 + $5 a scoop!< /review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Slow service, and it wasn't the workers fault. There were only two of them and it was really busy. But the main reason I gave it a 1 star was because it is in a super sketchy area. This woman comes in with her son, and asked for the key to the bathroom. She struggles to get it open so goes and tells the worker it is broken. The worker literally had her hands full at the moment, and she told the lady "ok I will be there in a second" the woman complained and said "no my son is going to pee his pants, he is going to have to pee in a cup" the woman goes and gets a water cup and takes her son to the back of the store to pee in a cup!!!!! Like what?! And what was surprising is that the workers just let it happen!! Like I said they were super busy, but still!!< /Text><name>ellimak< /name>< gmap_id>

Rude customer service offered by Eda Lagus, Assist Manager.
She can't even scan in a coupon correctly and when I tried to tell her how to scan in a coupon, she snapped at me with "I been working here for a long time.  Do you work for DQ?".  I use to work for fast food, so I know how the system works.

Besides this assistant manager being rude, most of the staff will ignore you to talk with each other.  I put up with this because this DQ is the closest one to us.

After Eda, DQ just lost a 2 year customer.  Thanks.

Avoid this DQ.</review>

Customer service was great, everything was good except the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge was a lil nasty. Im a cookie lover and the cookie's recipe could be greatly improved. Too dry on the outside and moist on the inside.</Review>

<text>The only reason I give it 4 stars is bc the young boy who helped me was really nice. Even tho he had a long line. I give the supervisor that was there 1 star because she let him handle 11 ppls orders as she did NOTHIN. The place was not clean and there was ppl waitin . As a supervisor she needed to help. But all she did was walk away as all the ppl came in.<//text><date>1468298051749< /date><user_name>ripsy/ /veronica</user_name><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>4</rating><Gmap_id>0x80dcd80146bcb93f:0x639228595ab510f8</Gmap_id><user_id>101756756953787472733</user_id>< pics>

Walked in at 9:05 p.m. and ordered chicken strips. The guy told us that the kitchen closed at 9 and they don't serve hot food. Very disappointed since we drove a long way to eat at DQ. It's strange that the kitchen closed at 9pm when the store is open until 10pm.<//review>

MRI time! Nice waiting room, super friendly reception peeps. They have a nice changing area that’s very private with lockers for security. They were on time and my technician was super kind especially since I’m claustrophobic and MRIs are not my thing. The tech took time to explain each step and not rush me. Since it was with contrast, I had to have an injection. He got me on the first try (double yay!)< /Review>

<Review>This was my first and during the pandemic for a CT. The place had lot of seniors and the staff were on guard and prompt to everyone across all ages. Thank you for showing courtesy and warm gestures all the while.<//Review>< Time>

Had a great experience as always. I came here for my first time years ago when I was pregnant. The staff is always friendly and professional. Today we came because my daughter needed an X-ray done. Since she’s a three year old you can imagine how difficult she can be, with anything medical related. However, the staff was really great with her. We appreciate their patience. At the end of the visit they gave her stickers and let her get a toy. Thank you James and Katie.</Text>

Imaging Partners is the best! I have had to use their skills on a few occasions and the office is clean and welcoming.   The office staff and technicians could not be nicer and more efficient.   There is plenty of parking and the office is easily accessible. Every experience I have had here has been a pleasure. Thank you for such wonderful, kind service.<//review>

This place was amazing for my mother’s needs. Catherine at the front was very welcoming and personable. The staff was incredible since my mother could not walk. Katie, Khan and George all helped to move my mother without any problems and with big smiles
The service was outstanding. Thank you for making the process easy.<//text>

I have been here numerous times for ultrasounds when I was pregnant with my kids and routine X-rays. Today I brought my son for a sinus x Ray. Everyone is always very helpful and friendly. Routine x rays are on a walk in basis, but we didn’t wait long at all< /review>

<review>Right when you walk in the place is inviting. Lighting is just right and overhead music is relaxing. I was helped right away by the next receptionist. Xrays walk ins are welcome however MRI, CT scans and I believe ultrasounds will need to be scheduled ahead of time and your Drs office will need to fax the order unless you have it then it can be scanned and emailed to their website. You have to arrive 30 minutes prior to your MRI so be prepared to wait where there is plenty of comfortable seating and magazines available.
Lindsey was my technician and he made me feel so comfortable..reason for 5 stars<//review>< pictures>

I’ve been coming here with a friend who is a patient. It will be the only place I will come in the future. The staff is amazing and appointments are easy to make and they run in time. Do yourself a favor as they are also very reassuring during what can be difficult times<//Review>

Imagine Partners were not on time.

I had a 9am appointment, because I wanted to be in and out, they were 30 minutes late.

I'm hearing more and more issues form doctors about patients being late.  The same goes for them.</Review>

I attempted to schedule an Urgent MRI twice today and kept getting the run around at first. They scheduled me for next week..for urgent, really! I was told it had to go through Utilization review and when I tried to explain my situation to the male rep, George didn't seem to care; he disregarded what was said and just insisted that once they have the status then they will call me back. I work in the medical field and I've heard that tone & statement time after time it's for reps that don't give a damm about you but just want you off the phone. If I were him I would have taken a different approach first I would apologize to the customer that stated she was in pain and would let her know I am going to do everything in my power to get an answer. Then I would have called SJHAP asking for the status because that's what a caring person does when they work in this type of industry. But instead I called my HMO medical group and was on hold for a while when I finally got through I was told there is NO AUTH required for an MRI and I should be able to schedule right away. I called Imaging partners but they close at 4:45pm. They really should keep their lines open til 5pm. I told the SJHAP rep what happened and was told to call customer service tomorrow to complain.
I just know that you have to advocate for yourself because unfortunately there was no one in that office that did.< /text>

Been using this facility since it opened. Go back 4 several reasons. Bottomlime- effective, high-end/ CLEAN,expert & highly competent  report docs (Radiologist), reliable, convenient. Easily had over a dozen MRI's & several other images (been very sick 4 long time). Reason I always choose this imaging center is due to the following (kindly read please...bout 15 seconds & is truthful).
Onus of a Positive visit is CONTINGENT UPON THE PATIENT (Us) BRINGING ALL DOCUMENTATION REQUESTED (call ahead if ur not sure)!!!
Full Disclosure- Own several HC/Medical companies. But do NOT have any biz relationship w/ these folks! Also have Spinal Stenosis, AS, Stage 4 AVN, & other wonderful med issues LOL...So I have had my fair share of office "experiences", visits, & hospital stays. All that said/written- this facility has always been expedient, same-day service capable, all imaging reports (mri - other films) have been completed ahead of regulatory timelines, eager 2 reprint reports & images on CD-ROM, & professional staff that makes me want 2 headhunt them for 1 of my offices.  Nuff Said as they say...Be Well, JSH (all in my humble.& limited experience)< /review>

July 27 2016 Wed. 12:45pm. The only front girl with black hair and heavy set....just describing to hopefully the Maneger reads this. Your employee needs to at least care for the patient's. Did not see proffesional service like your mission statement and it was not low stress also like your mission statement. She did not say sorry. She would of not work with my wife as the patient. Does not welcome patients or even care's. My wife had a 1pm appt for a 1 hour US, she is 20 wks pregnant. She has been drinking water for this big test. The front office girl has the authorization but no Dr. order. My wife Dr. Office was closed when the front office try to call no luck and we try helplessness trying to keep her appt but the front office
doesn't  care. She wanted legal document order and has to re schedule to late.... so I was upset, my wife and baby too.... gooo mission statement...way to go....<//Text>

<review>The food took forever to come out. It was about a 2 hr dinner because the veggies came out, then the raw meat and then the broth, which was not hot. Seemed so backwards. Oh and everything that came out was in about five min gaps. Still, the food was great!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I didn't get around to writing this review until now eight months later, but here we go.

Our group of six people for a birthday dinner came into the restaurant and there was only one other small party so it was rather empty and slow. The service was good at first with a friendly male server for the first 15 minutes, but then he kind of just disappeared for the rest of our meal. I had to flag down other employees who were walking past our table multiple times to get napkins, water, and basic table service.

I don't write too many negative reviews, but this experience even now, almost a year later, still stands out in my mind. Management at this restaurant needs to better train their employees.

The food portions we received were rather very small, and the pricing was on the higher end. We definitely didn't get a great amount of food for how much we paid, which was about $25 per person for the hot pot special and it's not even bottomless! I ordered a vegetarian dish and I only got what I recall as four small/medium pieces of tofu in it.

We definitely won't be coming back again. Disappointed!</Review><rating>2< /rating>< Gmap_id>

Delicious food and awesome owner! Besides the great food they have, the owner always takes care of us. We always order their beef and salmon teriyaki combo. The sukiyaki soup base is the best with the beef and vegetables. We dine here at least twice a week. Great food, great service, great ambience.<//text>

<Review>My family & I have been coming to this place for years now. Eddie the manager is wonderful, helpful, and makes sure you're accommodated. This place does tend to get busy during certain days & times, so I usually call ahead to ask wait time. Services can be a bit lagging during very busy times so go on a day not too busy.Their food is great. Their single portion shabu is enough for two people but we also get their 2 for special. Angus beef. Corn Miso and sukiyaki. Dipping Sauces are good with the cooked meats & rice with the broth. Other side sides were good too. Appetizer calamari were a great size. Not tiny. Decent quality and thick. Haven't had anything that has disappointed us. Place is clean. Will upload photos next time.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I so wanted to give this place 5 stars. The atmosphere is chill. The lunch special is amazing. Lost of food for a great price. The assorted roll was what scared me. I've attached a photo. I've had bad sushi before and this was a sign that I could not ignore. At any rate I hope this post give management a better idea of their product. I will be back.</Text>

DO NOT EAT HERE.  THE MANAGER OF THIS RESTAURANT DOES NOT SHOW UP TO HIS JOB AND LETS FRESHLY HIRED WORKERS RUN AMOK.  I went to dinner the other day to only to be treated in the most horrendous manner.  My order took FOREVER to arrive to my table despite the restaurant being completely empty, and the explanation from my waitress was "oh, well we have alot of phone orders."  I let that slide.  Finally, we got our main course but never got our appetizer, despite having reminded our waitress numerous times.  We completed our meal, and instead of getting our dessert, the waitresa gave us our check.  We reminded her of the dessert, be we never got that either.  Finally, exasperated, i asked to have the items we never got to be removed from our bill, but our waitress informed us she couldnt because the manager was not in.  And why was the waitress a complete train wreck?  Because she just started working there!  So this so-called manager left this newbie employee along with another newbie employee completely unsupervised to run the restaurant!!!!   Unbelievable.  If the manager cant even show up for work and cant properly train employees, i can only imagine how this restaurant accomplishes more difficult tasks like keeping things up to code, assures that food is being handles appropriately, etc.  For your own safety, please avoid this place.  It is only a matter of time before this managers irresponsible behavior results in disasterous consequences.<//review>

<text>Went on a Friday night and it was very busy! We were lucky enough to get there with one table open. Food was good! We had mixed tempura as an appetizer, as well as edamame. We ordered sushi rolls for dinner, the Tiger Roll being my favorite. The crunchy roll was ok.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>Way, way overpriced and inexperienced sushi chefs. The Maki are mediocre and lacking any skill or creativity. The Uramaki fall apart easily. Tables are very close together as people consistently bump into others’ tables whenever they moving about. One waiter for the whole restaurant and front counter. The spoons are huge relative to the bowls.<//review>< date>

<review>Everything here is great!

The shabu shabu quality is fantastic and it's made even better by their wide variety of soup bases, meats, and other ingradients.

Moreover, you can customize the sauces to your liking. You can come to this place so many times and try something different each time. Try the beef, it's a classic flavor.

Outside of their soups, the other food is good. If you have space at the end of your meal get the green tea ice cream, and yes, get it fried.

Service is always fast and friendly.

sometimes you'll find a Yelp check-in deal.</review>< Name>

Best shabu for your buck withi 50 miles I've been. They offer a lunch special for $7.99 that just can't be beat and their sauce bar is the best in town! The picture provides and idea of what you can for the price!</text>

<Text>Happy Hour prices are reasonable for both drink and food.  Nigiru sushi was excellent, wish they gave you a bit more sliced ginger with the order, but asking for extra was no problem.  The fish portions were large and high quality.  Would have preferred a bit  more sushi rice portion, but it's better this way than big rice/small fish!  My friend got the rolls and said they were great.  Saw others with Shabu Shabu and it looked fantastic with large portions.  Waiter said the lunch special is the hook up for the Shabu.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dccd3b2f214977:0x78bb4af4ca93c348<//Gmap_id>< rating>

An excellent hair salon, it's themed for kids but there are many adults that come too. I like scheduling with Ruben, he does a great job and remembers me and my haircut, but everyone is great here. If you bring kids there are TVs for them to watch and a good number of shows available. They say they open at 8 on Saturday, but they seem to open a bit earlier than that. Appointments are highly recommended, but not necessary.</text>

Went here for my baby’s first haircut before his 1st birthday and Ruben did such an excellent job, of course my baby was not very happy but Ruben was able to move around my baby and finish cutting his hair. We will definently be going back to this place.<//review>

Ruben is the best! My wife won't let me take them to supercuts or great clips 😂 We always go with Ruben, he cuts perfectly to the hair style of our twins! They have TVs at every both with every movie/show a kid could want. They have the coolest barber chairs for the kids to sit in while they get a cut and watch Disney+. Thanks for always doing a great job Ruben!< /review>

<review>Kayla was amazing! All the staff there was super friendly! My son is two years old and has always hated haircuts, it has been a chore to take him. I brought my son here based off recommendations and I’m definitely not disappointed! Kayla was super patient with him and my son did not cry once, he was very happy in fact he didn’t want to leave! Thank you, we will definitely we back!<//review>< time>

This is an amazing place to take your kids for a haircut. They have cool seats, TV's to watch while the kids get a haircut, it's clean, everyone is friendly, the decor is beautiful and their prices are fair.
My 17 month old son loves getting his haircut here, by Anthony, as he watches Toy Story.</review>

Took my 2yo son for his first haircut. They were great! Had plenty things to keep kids busy, plus they know how to keep the young ones happy while cutting their hair. No easy feat, and they have the patience of saints. Highly, highly recommend. We'll be back for the foreseeable future to keep our boy clean cut. 😁👍</text>

I took my son here for his 1st haircut and told her to keep it long. He went in with 6inches of beautiful curls and asked for only a TRIM; only cut off the ends. Well, she left him with only an 1.5 inch of hair. Won’t be going back because he might be bald next time. And $22 seems pretty steep for a cut.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This place is so fun! They really distract kids while they get their hair cut. It's so much fun they have little cars the kids sit in and they have TV's in front of the cars. So the kids get to watch movies while they get their hair cut. Plus they have free arcade games you can play which is my favorite part. And in the back of the store they have fun things the kids can play with like a small play ground and some fun puzzles on the walls. It's so much fun. At the end of the hair cut the kids can get free lollipops or cracks. And the service is really good they are so sweet.< /Review>

Big Thank You To Ruben!!! We took are 4 year old son (who has Autism) for his first hair cut and Ruben was so great with are son so patient and making sure my son felt the most comfortable with the clippers, and even though my son gave him kind of a hard time Ruben went ABOVE AND BEYOND and we can't thank him enough for a great hair cut but also being so patient with are son and going beyond what I excepted from any barber!

Also we drove from Lancaster because we could not find a kid friendly barbershop in are area and being his first haircut I'm so glad we made the drive here because the place was clean a lot of toys, candy, video games, tvs with every Disney movie and more. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for there first kids haircut are needs a great friendly barbershop!!!

THANK YOU AGAIN RUBEN!!!< /text>

<review>The staff was very kid friendly and my son had a great overall experience for his first hair cut. They even took a picture of us after his hair cut and gave us a copy of it with a lock of his hair. They also had arcade games for all the other kids if they wanted to play games while waiting for they're appointment.</review>< pictures>

Great staff. We always make appointments for our kids prior to their haircuts, and we are always in and out within our appointment time. Anita has been cutting our kids hair since they were little, she gives great haircuts and the kids love their getting their haircuts by her.<//text>

<text>I have taken my daughter here 3 times with two of them being disappointing. Sarah has cut her hair the last two times, I end up regretting going there. My friend's daughter also had a bad experience. People are nice,  but haircuts are not. Going somewhere else next time.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>They have given all of my daughters their very first haircuts.  Children had their choice of car to sit in and movie to watch while they got snipped.  At the end we got a certificate and a lock of their hair for us to keep.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGXXd7JkB2OswpPwDdNqpI4XZ6d5wPxvb3PjFa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

Gloria was great when my son was apprehensive about getting his haircut, all he wanted to do was play so she let him play.  She let him stand up playing a video game as she cut his hair. She was great!<//Review>

They have the best barber in the world, Ruben. Ruben is one of the most impressive people I have ever met. He is son nice and endearing to small children it is truly something to behold. After taking my children here and having their hair cut by Ruben, it wasnt long until I started having my hair cut by Ruben as well.

The best thing about this place is that all of the other stylist's are fantastic as well. I wouldn't hestitate to recogmend this place to anyone.<//review>

Fadaie Insurance has Far exceeded any expectations I could ever have of an insurance company. My situation was a bit unique and I felt like they took the time to address every question and concern of mine. They made me feel like I was a very important customer. They even were able to beat out rates from the supposed unbeatable USAA insurance. Ask for Melissa Mendez she will take care of you! I will be using her from here on out! I never thought I could be so satisfied with insurance.<//Text>

I worked with Sandra on March 6th and she found a policy for my home in San Francisco with Safeco insurance. I was comparison shopping and this was the best rate. Sandra was professional and worked swiftly and competently to find a policy to fit my needs. However, shortly after paying for this policy, I was contacted by Safeco with a demand that they had ordered an exterior appraisal of my property. I was never told to expect this by Sandra. The appraiser came on April 1st. On April 28th, Sandra informed me that Safeco was increasing my annual premium by 1,274 from 5,376 - an increase of 24%. She said that they did not realize that San Francisco had a higher rate per square footage. I expect people in the insurance business to know the rates - isn't that their business?? I have informed Fadaie that I am very unhappy about this and they have offered to work with me for a solution. I think this company works very hard to take care of their customers, but I think I should have been informed that 1) an appraisal would be demanded by the insurance company and 2) that the rate they quoted was an estimate subject to that appraisal. I will be switching insurances agencies and insurance providers.<//Review>

<review>We purchased a Travelers Home Insurance policy with Sandra. She has exceeded my expectations in customer service through the escrow process, and continues to be very helpful. I was not expecting this level of personal engagement, and I really enjoy it. Working with this company is so much better than my previous experiences with insurance groups.< /review>< Pictures>

I can’t say enough good things about Fadaie, and particularly its agent a Henry, after purchasing a homeowners policy from them today.  Henry was patient, professional, got me an excellent rate, and responded to my emails so quickly that it almost felt like we were having a conversation in real time.  His support staff also was excellent, sending the policy immediately to my lender and sending me the fax confirmation sheet within minutes.  If they keep this up, they’re going to have me as a client for a very long time.< /text>

They tried a couple different providers, got the quotes to us quickly, and adapted the policies as we went.  Very creative short term rental, long term rental and homeowners  combined policy that was not offered by many in the market.  We had some trouble (we caused it) on the back-end with some of the processing of the new policy and they made it right!   Signed, a Loyal Customer</Text>< user_id>

Henry Galvan is the best insurance agent!! He helped me after I had an awful experience with a different agent somewhere else. I am so lucky that my friend referred me to him. Whenever I have any questions about my policy he calls me back super fast. He’s genuinely nice, knowledgeable, and professional. I never felt like he was just trying to me a quick dollar off me. Top rate service from a top rate agent!</text>

Excellent service and great prices, i have been working with Henry Galvan for years and i couldn't be happier with his work. I brought many friends and family in need of good car coverage and they have been very pleased as well. He is extremely knowledgeable and even if you don't know much about insurance he will find you the best policies at the best rate.  A+++ Highly recommend</review>

Great friend and a great insurance services that Mr. Fadaie has provided for my family and me. He works with many different cases and I have gotten many different insurances through him. Khasha Fadaie helped me get the best ratting for different insurances such as car, motorcycle and life insurance. He does many more things and if I ever need anything else, he is the man that I will be giving the call!<//Review>

Mr Fadaei is an extremely competent professional who is honest, straightforward, and really cares for his clients. I have been his client for around 10 years and I have used him for all different kinds of insurance and every time the rate that he got me was better than anybody else. Besides being a very intelligent and competent agent, he's also a wonderful human being who has a heart of gold and cares very deeply about his clients and his own professional work because of his love for the Beloved God. In other words he is ruled by a higher principle than business and regulations. In summary, I give Mr. Fadaei my highest recommendation.< /text>

<text>I am a full time student who just graduated cal state and I was thrilled with the service I received. Not only did the company assure that I obtained a full coverage insurance they also did it at a great price! I highly recommend anyone to seek business with this company. More specifically, I recommend other fellow students to become a client to Fadaie insurance. They will provide quality service and give you the most economic price for insurance. I recommend you speak with Lizbeth she was a wonderful agent very attentive and concerned with providing excellent service. Lizbeth made the experience easy and listened to all of my needs and concerns. Overall, It was top quality service and I definitely encourage others to become clients of this company.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><Name>Diana Hernandez<//Name><Resp>{'time': 1496242894939, 'text': 'Diana we appreciate your comments and wish you the best in your endeavors to come.

<rating>5</rating><review>First of All I would like to thank you Mr. Kash and his team efforts for outstanding customer service for our corporation to meet the criteria of our clients.

We tried several Insurance agencies to meet our clients requirements. Once we found Kash. Our search has stopped here and now we have long term relations with Fadaie Insurance Services.

Kash team is very efficient to send the quotes in a timely manner and earn the business right away.

I would say this is the best Insurance agency in town I have ever had.

Once again thank you Kash

I have been dealing with Fadaie insurance for the last seven years and I think they are the best in the town. KASH and his staff are simply wonderful . I kind of developed a personal relationship with KASH from the day one as he is a very pleasant , accommodating person and has thorough knowledge of his profession.
I referred my other family members to him and they all are very pleased with the courteous and professional service they get. Our home insurance is also through them and we always get the best possible rate . Awesome service always and I feel pleasure in recommending the agency .</review>

<text>Thankful for Kash in helping us with our needs insurance for our martial arts gym. He truly cares about our success.  He made sure we had the right coverage to protect our new gym from things we had not considered. Thanks for that. The online quotes from other companies don't go into that. Glad we got to deal with you in person.

It helps to work with someone who has the experience and expertise to get you the right coverage.  Give Kash a call and you'll understand what I mean.< /text>< userid>

I want to thank Kash for helping me since day one at Old Town. Liz was extremely helpful when she worked there, she was my go to representative. Nonetheless, Jim was remarkably supportive with my partner Arvin and I, he got our newly company instituted by providing both of us with information regarding general liability insurance. My partner and I are both unfamiliar and new to the commercial business insurance aspect but Jim pointed us in the right direction and followed up with both us.
In addition, Henry also assisted me in my motorcycle insurance needs couldn't be happier with my coverage, he explained and broke down it down so I could comprehend.
My entire insurance coverages from dwelling to business to vehicles come from the help of Fadaie Insurance. Kash has a phenomenal and knowledge staff that can assist you in any of your insurance needs, even the receptionist is extremely friendly. If you want to pay dirt cheap for great coverage then I highly recommend their services to everyone! Make no mistake about it.</Review>

I was looking for a new insurance agent who could get me a good rate on auto and renters insurance. When I came across Fadaie Insurance, they not only got me a great rate, they also gave me great service and support. In just an hour or two they had me all set up. Thank you Fadaie Insurance for being professional insurance brokers in Temecula, CA</Review>

My family has been dealing with henry for about 20 years now when he was with another company. My family fallows him everywhere. He always goes above and beyond to the point that i have his personal number if anything comes up. He makes it very personal and love dealing with him. I wont go anywhere else unless henry is there.

Thanks brotha

Kash contacted me when a couple of his clients relocated from California to Arizona. He helped get the info so i could requote them and then reviewed the quotes afterwards to make sure were well taken care of.  Rarely do I see agents take such good care of clients that essentially are leaving him ( due to moving out of state). Just shows that he really cares. I would recommend this kind of agent to everybody.</Review>

< Review>
It doesn’t matter who answers the phone at this agency they are the most helpful, professional, and courteous agents you will find. Not only did they save us money (even with 2 teen male drivers in my home)…They helped us through an unfortunate accident. Even followed up with the insurance adjuster to make sure we were taken care of. Constantly surprising me with continued follow up and checking my policies saving me money whenever they can even if it means more work for them. I do not take the time to write testimonials for companies very often. But I truly feel that this business is one of the few left that is staffed with people who honestly care about their clients. I highly recommend you at least give these guys a chance at earning your business. You will not be sorry.< /Review>

<review>They're always friendly with smile as you walk-in. I know it's hard for me to smile like they do. As soon you seat down first question they'll asked, "CAN WE GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK?" Mostly places doesn't do that. The person I admire at Fadaie Insurance Service was hmm I cannot think of her name but she's Hispanic she look to be & I believe her husband work at Pala Casino.

From the moment I was referred  to Kasha the owner of Fadaie Insurance you could tell he was a man off integrity, he does exactly what he says he is going to and he wastes no time.  It's hard to find people like this in this day and age. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

At first that I meet this guy(Kasha) in Fadaie insurance, He was a Gentleman and He was very friendly person, Even I invited him and all his family to my home for few times and  I got my cars,home, motor cycle  and health insurance and umbrella insurance from him and even I told my brother about him and he transferred his insurance to Fadaie too, but as soon as his business start growing he forgot who he is and service has gone down as far as it could ,I have start changing my broker ,if you are looking to buy insurance forget about him his not the right person. and his not honest he prices is not good for what he offers.< /text>

<Review>I had a great experience working with Kasha. We suffered water damage in our kitchen and I called up Kasha to report the damage. He was immediately on the phone with the Safeco (with me on the Line) and got the claim registered. He then helped me setting up a restoration company to come out the same day and start the restoration work. I am very happy to say the least. Thank you for the great service and it puts my mind at ease knowing that I have Fadaie Insurance services taking care of our insurance needs and being there when we need them.

I am a local  Real Estate Broker and I am a Fadaie Insurance client! I have known Kasha for almost 13 years, needless to say that we became very good friend.
Sometime work and friendship doesn't work well...right? Wrong! Kasha has been the most ethical and diligent insurance agent I have ever met! I am totally bias...but for a valid reason!
I virtually send all my clients to Kasha and systematically I receive praise from my clients commanding me and thanking me for such a great insurance referral!
Kasha is true to his clients, caring and honest! I rest my case with one last thought, you'll be shortchanging yourself if you'll not give Kasha a call!< /Review>

<review>I called in my order at 5pm, Deep Dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese $12 and change total.  Great deal, I briefly opened the box and thought everything looked good. When I arrived home we got ready to eat and noticed one side 4 slices was cheese and pepperoni missing sausage. The other 4 pieces were accurate.  I tried calling the store on 4 different occasions when I got home. I was on hold each time upwards to 13 minutes being the longest and I hung up. Disappointed and will not return to this location.<//review>< pictures>

You know, they have very good pizzas here. The crusts are soft and delicious and they have a great sauce that they paint for a first preliminary layer before adding cheese and more (at $2 a piece for an extra topping).
Now also they have a big sign in the window which offers a medium pizza with cheese and pepperoni for $5. My friend Jesse and I came in and ordered two pizzas with two extra toppings each. He also got a 2 liter bottle of dr. Pepper. So 2 * 5 is $10, and 4 * $2 a piece for the extra 4 toppings is $8 more. That makes $18 for the two pizzas, right? No, the total came to a little over $27 and I'm trying to figure out how they added that up. They would have to charge nine dollars for a 2 L soda. Okay, I figured the tax and we'll be generous and deduct $2 from that. But a 2 liter soda is no way $7. It's not even $5. You can get a pizza for $5, but they generally cost more than a 2 liter Dr Pepper. Hum. Let me check the receipt. It says $27.60. And they charged me $7 a piece for each Pizza that is advertised for $5 each on the giant sign that can cover half a bus that's on the outside window. Grr!<//Text>

<review>We're not regulars. We do not know how things work here. I phones my wife to pick up dinner. I ordered it and told my wife that it was under my name. She was given the order and was told it was all there. She made it home and there was no ranch dressing for wings wich I had purchased for $.75. And purchasing dip for the wings??? Fine, whatever. Again, no one at Little Ceasars bothered to check the order. My wife made it home realizing that the 2 liter Pepsi was missing. Made another trip to pick that up. Exactly what my wife wNts to do after working 10 hours.</review>< Pictures>

No hassle but the toppings are the same amount as the regular. I religiously buy both type pizzas to compare at every ceasars I go to. they always tend to not make the extra most bestest the same as normal hot & ready. oh well</Text>

<text>I ordered online for delivery the cost for 2 pizzas is 18$ when you can just pick it up for carryout for 10$ instead there I felt ripped off. Second one out of the two pizzas where fresh and the other one was dry , stale , and taste like it was left in the warmer. Don't order little Caesars delivery.</text>< pictures>

<Text>pizza and service here is above par. I wish there were more places like this around town. Had a friend come into town and she asked me to take her here again. It has a great atmosphere. If it wasn't far from my work I would come by more.< /Text>< pics>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!
I called in an order. They took forever to pick up the phone, the girl answered and she was super rude. Her name was Veronica. She asked what I wanted to order so I told her my order and she asked if that was it, I said yes and she said okay and hung up. Didn’t tell me how long my order would take.
I walk in there she doesn’t greet me. I go up to the counter and I have to tell her I’m there to pick up my order she took the payment and then didn’t even tell me my order wasn’t ready or anything just gave me my change and left me there.
When my order was ready she called my name put the pizza on the counter and didn’t even say have a good day or not even a thank you. If she’s so miserable working there she should just quit instead of making us customers feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable. She needs to learn how to treat clients with some manners.< /text>

<Text>This place needs better management and decided workers. When I arrived I witnessed a bunch of kid workers just playing around and immediately I thought, “are they playing around with the food” so I decided to leave until they clean up their act and clean their clothes. SMH<//Text>< response>

Phoned in my order at 6:23.was told be ready in 15 min. Got there and payed, and waited untill 7. Just to find out my order was waiting in the warmer the whole time.  A bunch of other customers were complaining how long it took to receive food. Walk-ins were ordering and getting theirs right away.  Something needs to change at this location. Not impressed.< /text>

You won't find me rating Little Ceasar's Pizza based on the quality of their food. You can be your own judge of that; however it's safe to say the general public could agree on basic store operation standards like customer service and general cleanliness. Don't expect this store to achieve those two basic functions.</Review>

This store is NEVER on point! I have come here and waited 20 minutes for a pizza I had to put in the oven when I got home! Tonight, I was told it was a 30 Mom wait for a $6 ‘hot and ready’! The pick up oven had pizzas in it but no pick up names. I’m done with this one. I’ll be driving all the way to the one on California from now on. Terrible location!</review>

Took WAY too long to get supposed "Hot and Ready Pizzas." There system was very inefficient. Instead of putting more of their best selling item, $5 pep, they were putting in 1 of their new $6 pizzas, a cheese pizza, then a pep pizza, and the cycle repeated itself. So my 10-15 min wait turned into 35 minutes especially since they gave out a pizza to two different customers who ordered AFTER me! Those should have been mine.<//text>

The girl must be her first day or somthing. Ive never heard some one say "gimme a sec" 3 times in a row. They are so backed up right now because of her that she is telling people 20 minutes and then calling there names out less than 1 minute later. Dude i dont want food thats been sitting in a warmer. It tends to get chewy and greasy as all hell.<//text>

<text>Hoping your mangers read these comments. This location NEVER has any hot and readys. And when you do get a pizza it is undercooked. Always a bummer. I love little Caesars, but I will drive twice as far to not go to this location.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I had just left Wells Fargo Bank after spending 2 hours trying to RESOLVE an issue REGARDING FRAUD.

The fact that the Bank acted like they DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHO I WAS. THIS ATTITUDE WAS NOT ONLY UPSETTING, FRUSTRATING AND ALMOST TO THE POINT OF BEING DEGRADINGE!!!

This attitude and behavior of Wells Fargo Employee directed towards me was humiliating after being a part of this Wells Fargo Bank for years way back in the day when it was inside the Ralph's and them it moved next to Elliott's Pet Store and CONTINUED when they moved to their present location.

My loyalty to Wells Fargo Bank remained FAITHFUL even when I was a victim of there opening unneeded accounts that was so widely reported in the news I still REMAINED.

Until I walked into the Wells Fargo Bank and needed help to recover money taken fraudulently from an account and all of a sudden in an instant who are you?

I WAS TREATED UNFAIRLY AS IF I WAS A STRANGER AN UNKNOWN PERSON.
THE TREAMENT WAS A COMBINATION OF UNCARING, HARSH AND INCONSIDERATE BEHAVIOR.

I FELT ABUSED, ILL-TREATED AND DISRESPECT TO THE POINT THAT ONCE THE FRAUD ISSUE IS RESOLVED I AM CLOSING MY ACCOUNT IMMEADIATLY.

AFTER OVER 25 YEARS WITH WELLS FARGO BANK THEY TREATED ME SO SHABBY I AM DONE.

I left the Wells Fargo Bank feeling low and greatly disappointed almost crying sad and extremely low in feelings and spirt to be treated in such a manner after all these years.

But then as I walked out I looked up and saw Little Caesar's Pizza right across the way.

I smiled and said YES! I KNOW IT IS JUST PIZZA. BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS MORE THAN PIZZA. IT WAS FEELING GOOD.

I walked in and was greeted with a big smile and a cheerful hello!  and a how is your day going? And what would like today?

Well that is all it took this one person's act of kindness to let all the Wells Fargo Bank's BS to slide down and be forgotten in that instant

I left Little Caesar's Pizza with a warm smile from that one person and a quick enjoy your pizza thank you for coming in and have a great pizza.

It could gave been he just started his day or was new on the job but the kindness expressed to me was truly NEEDED and APPRECIATED.

I HONESTLY enjoyed my pizza when I got home in part because the person who waited on me was so outstanding and the other part the pizza was FRESH AND HOT AND TASTY

Both my tummy and spirt was filled that day by Little Caesar's Pizza.

I am still waiting to resolve my issue with Wells Fargo Bank but once that is cleared I am done I want NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH Wells Fargo Bank.

But as for Little Caesar's Pizza I will be back!

I was disturbed when I saw an employee  handle food then money and didn't wash their hands.  I nicely pointed it out and she just looked at me like I was crazy.  Sanitation in the food industry is very important!< /text>

<Text>This place used to be on top of things with the "hot and ready", but for the last few months it seems like there is never anything ready. Today I complained to the guy at the register. He explained that the turn over rate with new hires was very high.. people dont stay long and they have to continuously train people. After a few exchanged words, I realized he was the manager. I am going to rate this place as a one star for now and will edit my post when they figure out how to keep employees long enough. At first I was heated when I walked out (having to wait over 10 minutes for 2 hot and readys) , but once I digested the words exchanged, I started to feel bad for the manager. Hes aware of the problem but sounds like he genuinely doesnt know how to keep employees long enough. I hope he figures it out, cause I'm not going to give up on this place for the time being. Manager guy, if your  reading this... I dont want to see u fail, I really do hope u find the issue, cause if the customers are happy, you'll enjoy working there and not have to deal with upset customers. Rootin' for u to succeed</Text>< pics>

<name>Nick Ponce<//name><Text>I’ve been having bad experiences with his location. They hire kids who have no idea what they are doing. My last visit, yesterday the 18th of January 2018, will be my very last time at his location. I’ll drive the extra mile to get pizza off of California. I ordered 2 pizzas and a crazy combo. The guy taking my order always has an attitude problem like it’s my fault he works there. He took so long to get my food, the last bread that I bought was given to the lady after me. It was given to her by the manager who obviously didn’t care that I ordered first. Maybe cause she was a woman and I was a man? Mind you I already paid for it. Now I was told I need to wait 7-10 minutes for more bread with a smile on their faces. When the next bread came out it was given to the man after the woman who was after me. They skipped me twice and now I had to wait another 10 minutes. So after 20 minutes of waiting for bread that I shouldn’t have had to wait for, the kid goes to get me my sauce and tells me he could only fill it half way because they ran out of sauce. I guess they weren’t able to make anymore pizzas that day since they ran out. That place has been going down hill and now they lost a customer. Might not be a big deal to other people but when you wake up every day at 4am, you want to get food and go home to eat and relax with the family and not wait for incompetent people who have no idea what the real world is like.</Text>< Rating>

There is no words to tell about this place . This is the most , the best banquet hall ever we have been before. Service is the best, food is amazing... we are not having parties in here, also whenever we have any occasion in our house ,we order from them, we recommended them to our friends, everyone is happy.
Highly recommended place in heart of Glendale.
Choose this spot you will never regret that!!!!

We had a last minute event at La Boheme.
We needed to find a place to have a mercy meal.  We thought we were settling at La Boheme but to everyone's  surprise  it was one of the most pleasant  experiences  that our family has had. The owner Arthur was great. The food was amazing and the service excellent. I would highly recommend La  Boheme to everyone.  Our family talked about it  and we will definitely  have another event here. Thank you guys for a the great evening  under these tough and difficult  times.

Delicious food and excellent customer service.

Was here few days ago for a welcome baby party and was absolutely satisfied with their food, service and the restaurant in general.
The interior design was beautiful and nicely decorated.  Waiters were very nice and friendly. Will definitely recommend this place for any occasion or event.<//text>

The customer service was definitely good: they are both nice and attentive. The appetizers were also delicious, and the alcohol settled nicely with the food. We had a small group, about 20 people. We did my mother's joshgerooyt(dinner after the funeral service) we had a pleasant time, it was a cozy atmosphere. Will go there again.</Text>< Pics>

My parents just celebrated their wedding anniversary here and are more than satisfied with this venue. Arthur and his team provided my family with the best experience from planning the party all the way through to the end of the night. The food is exceptional and the service was even better! The team were a great help in setting up our decorations hours before the event and they were more than willing to offer us some of their equipment. We highly recommend this venue and already have some family members contacting us for more information. Thank you again Arthur!<//Text>

<text>Let me start off by thanking Arthur and his staff for the amazing service during my 21st birthday. Everything was amazing, the food, the service, the venue was all 5/5. The venue was very clean, and the food was fresh and cooked with high quality ingredients. The venue is also very beautiful and is the perfect size for banquet hall events. The Valet parking was also very professional, and the owner Arthur was great in making sure everything went smoothly. All my guests also enjoyed the venue and had a great time. Thank you!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

Second time we went here for our party. Arthur is just an amazing host and makes it very easy for us. There wasn't a thing he didn't  accommodate with a pleasant smile. The food was outstanding! The hot dishes came out in perfect timing and intervals. Salmon and shrimp were cooked perfect and not overcooked! The waiters were extremely polite and attentive. To date I have not been to an event where waiters followed each guest to the car showing assistance with flowers and food. Such a professional environment. Really enjoyed it and will definitely go there again for any of our parties. This will be our go to banquet hall! Thank u to the chefs, staff and Arthur for making our very special day perfect!</review>

We had a birthday party here and had an amazing time. The owner, Arthur, was very professional and went through everything very thoroughly. From the moment we talked to Arthur, we could tell that this party was going to be a success. He was very helpful and organized. All our guests were impressed and they all had an awesome time. The food and service were also excellent. Everyone is still talking about it. We are already planning future events here.</review>

If it were possible I would give this Hall six stars.  I had an amazing experience.  Everything went perfect.  The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the management was great.  I recommend ❤❤❤LA BOHEME BANQUET HALL to anyone who asks me where to hold their event.<//review>

This place is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to that place. when  I feel like having a superb meal, this place comes right away to my head. good and all kinds of  food and a rich cuisine.professional staff members, and agreeable atmosphere. In addition to that, the price is modest. I praise this spot with pleasure.</text>

The staff was unrelenting in their unprofessional behavior,  and unfortunately the management did not provide any relief. The Hall is smaller than it looks.
The kabob was salty and over seasoned. The meat dried to a rubbery consistency. The parking arrangement was horrible. They've monopolized the parking lot to overcharge the valet and they are uncompromising and inconsiderate of special needs vehicles or large vehicles.
As with all reviews,  consider an objective view on the relationship of the reviewer and the source of their review. I am not bound by personal relationships,  nor am I bound by my culture to share my experience about LA Boheme Hall.

I will say, I'll never allow the celebration of my happy memories to such offences made by LA Boheme Banquet Hall.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

So disappointed! Just spent 8k on a sectional sofa. We wanted quality and were willing to pay for it. It took over 3 months to arrive and looked beautiful in our family room. Unfortunately the first time you sit on ANY of the cushions they sag and leave wrinkles in the fabric. This has never happened with Ethan Allen. We contacted the store with photos. Hopefully they will do something to rectify this situation and I can update my review. Meanwhile, avoid Bassett- not worth it.<//Text>

Truly beautiful furniture. Not sure that the prices are reasonable--seems high
They do have pleasant people greet you and they stay available to answer questions. They also have home design services and many other fabrics available</text>

Went in thinking we wanted one thing but found something completely different that we fell in live with. Paula was patient and helpful even though we walked in about 20 minutes before closing.  Great service and quality furniture.< /review>

I purchased a recliner couch on Labor Day of this year it is now December 11 and I still haven’t gotten my replacement couch for the defective couch that was delivered to me it’s been over 3 1/2 months that these people keep pushing it out 15 days or it’s going to be here then and it’s going to be here in another 15 days now it’s does they said it would be here on December 7 now it’s December 11 no call from them no update.
I was told by the sales person that it was built by Bassett I assumed it was in the United States I later find out that it’s actually from China and when I question them about it they said it’s built to their specifications but if it’s built to their specifications then why did I receive a couch Recliner that is defective it has taken them so long to replace it they’re probably continuing to sell this couch to other people while I’m still waiting for my replacement couch
One side of the couch walks back-and-forth it has a 2 inch difference than the other side of the couch.< /review>

I want to thank Nancy Johnson at Bassett Furniture in Dublin, CA for helping me redecorate my family room. She listens which I feel is very important. Nancy is helpful with ideas and suggestions and she is a creative, talented designer. I also want to mention John who is another excellent design consultant at Bassett. John worked along with us to find the perfect textiles for my room. I could not be happier with the result!

Designer John Davis is the ONLY reason I purchased over $25,000 worth of beautiful new furniture for my new house. I have a MODEL home because of John! He has a GREAT eye, AMAZING customer care and service, I had a very personalized experience when he came to my home and I learned a lot about how different fabrics work together with my type of home and exactly what I was going for. That said, they need to give talented designers like John, more power to make the customer even happier - I would have purchased even more! Thank you John Davis!

<text>Once the "designer" that assisted us finalized the sale she completely disappeared.  She told us she would call us 2 days after our purchase to give an idea of when our recliner would be delivered.  Yet over a month passed without so much as a call or email from this woman.  In fact, I had to call myself to get information on our purchase.  We were also not given a time window for the delivery date which is very inconvenient.  Basset has great quality furniture but these glaring service flaws may be enough to prevent me from returning.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I used to think that Bassett furniture had the best products as well as the best customer service until now.  I purchased one of their more expensive sectionals called the “Envelop” and paid almost Six Thousand dollars$$$  for the 5 Individual sectional pieces.  First of all one of the pieces was defective and needed to be repaired, replaced, fixed!!  This venture all started in August, furniture delivered in September.......They sent a technician to my house to see if it could be repaired, tech couldn’t fix it said needed to be replaced.  He ordered the new piece, I called Bassett as well to confirm what the technician said.  They said it would be another month until the new piece would be delivered.  The beginning of November they deliver the WRONG PIECE!!!  I am furious.......its now going to be the holidays and I have tags on the furniture WAITING for the right piece.  I call VERY upset talked to Bassett whom assured me the matter would be taken care of, and someone of “Higher Authority” would be calling me back.  At this point I want my money back!!!  The furniture hasn’t even been used, still has tags on and the Holidays are around the corner.  Well the holidays came  and went.......unable to have ANY at my house due to unusable furniture.......its now December 31st going on New Years and NO ONE  from Bassett has called, no furniture no NOTHING!!!  I am amazed that I can spend that type of money and receive such poor customer service........so folks don’t make the same mistake I made.  Buy from your smaller local furniture stores they’re not so High End that they cant take care of their customers. Happy New Year!!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Name>Vivi Russell<//Name><time>1536181505826<//time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I was saw the good reviews here so choose here to bought the furniture, from the very beginning, The sales person Jeanne came to Service me, I told her I just got a house, I need all the furniture, she make offer to me said: I can help you with that, I also can going to your house to help you design the furniture, I was very satisfied by her Service, and than after she went to my house and I went to the store again to choose the furniture, I I told her I will going to Macy’s to looking for the mattress first and than come back because the day is the last day Macy’s had the big sale, I went to Macy’s to bought the mattress and some furniture and than came back to Bassett to told Jeanne I got something from Macy’s and she told me she is upset with that, I understand, because she try to help me to pick the furniture even went to my house,and she told me she will do her best to give me 50% off discount of all furniture, I still like Bassett furniture and I like her service too, I don’t want her work for free, eventually I spent like 4~5 hour to pick my 2 bedroom sets and one dining table with bench but without dining chairs (out of budget)and ottoman, because is late time the Manager Pauly and Jeanne try to Close-up the deal kind of push me, didn’t cross check all the item numbers and the invoice wrote so mess, all the numbers and furniture have so many prices, only they can understand, she told me is all the furniture 50% off, when the time the check out only 25% off or 35% off, in this point I already feel being cheating, but again I like the furniture I choose even it wasn’t 50% off and again I don’t want she work for free, so I still pay for it, but today I’m here to writing this review is because two days ago I got 2 items have defect, side table and they damaged the other side table not delivered, and the ottoman was wrong one, I choose the one is rectangle not the Square one, the square one it was in the show room I’m finger point that said I want the fabric, but not the shape, I sitting on the couch and the one ottoman I want it, I asking Jeanne is this one too low for my couch? She told me , you don’t want elevation your legs way up when you sit down, and I agreed that, so I told her I want this one with that fabric,she knew the one I want, but now they gave me a wrong one, which is the square one, and I called back to her, she don’t answer the phone so I called the store and they told me she is with customers right now, after she have time will call me back, but I never get her to call back!! it’s her mistake, and now I have to pay for it, I got a punishment for her mistake!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80d9451131093137:0xe2a36cc89d879920< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My experience at Bassett was a pleasant one.  I worked with Kathy Kenny who was fabulous!  She was extremely knowledgeable and professional.  She did not pressure me to make a purchase.  She listened to me and made relevant suggestions.  I will definitely seek her out the next time I go to Bassett.</Review>

<text>Melanie Baker was amazing! She asked the right questions to understand exactly what our needs were. After carefully listening, she took us around the store to show us a few products. Melanie was knowledge, cortious, and honest.

We ended up getting a quote on a few items. She was relaxed and not pushy about making the sale! We ended up returning the next day to buy! It was a great experience! If you are in need for a beutiful leather couch set, make the drive to see Melanie; she will make your time invested well worth it!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d9451131093137:0xe2a36cc89d879920< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Our sectional sofa looks great! They really knew what size to put in our room as the sofas in the store can look different in your home. Only downside is that they do the design review in the store when they should be doing it in your home so they can show you exact measurements and fabrics in your home's lighting. Had to make a few changes to the design but everything turned out good. Will post another review if we use the warranty.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Horrible experience. If I could give them 0 stars I would. My husband and I barely made it through the doors before we were approached by a sales person (older white female with short orangish hair) she asked what we were looking for and my husband asked if they had children's furniture. She was quick to say they didn't, then I asked if they at least had full size beds, and again real quick to say no, then answered well maybe just one, she explained that it's brown and we wouldn't like it. She didn't even show it to us, but went on to say how expensive furniture was and how kids don't need it; Like did her kids not have furniture? And how does she know what we consider expensive? Then she started suggesting furniture stores from down the street to 40 plus miles away, she literally suggested any and every store but that one. It was clear she didn't want our business and we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Truley felt it was racial profiling and age discrimination. Very disappointed and will not ever go back.

This is based purely on my experience of dealing with the sales department while trying to make a rather large recent purchase. My wife was narrowing  her choices to purchase a bedroom set and had established contact with a manger who then put her in contact with a member of the sales department. This member was extremely helpful and spent a tremendous amount of time going over things and working with my wife to ensure she was happy with her purchase and to make sure her needs were met. They agreed on a day that the purchase would be made and finalized.

Wanting to see the set for myself, I walked into the showroom on another day and was met with another member of the sales department. I told this sales associate that my wife was already working with another member of their team but I wanted to look at some bedroom sets. I asked some basic questions and looked at the sets my wife wanted me to see. I thanked the sales member for their time and said I would arrive in a couple of days with my wife to hopefully finish the purchase. At that time I was told that I shouldn’t wait and that the bedroom set needed to be ordered that day. I was told if I waited the set we wanted may not be available anymore. I told her I would meet with my wife and return in a few days.

A few days passed and I returned to the store to finalize the purchase with my wife. We were met with the associate I had spoke with and I informed them I would be needing the original associate that had been working with my wife. That original associate showed up and while my wife finished up the details of the purchase, I found out that the associate that showed me the sets I looked at, was now telling the other supervisor or manager on the floor that they would be “Splitting the purchase”. I guess that ment they would be splitting the commission. This didn’t feel right to me since the original associate was the one who did most of the work and also was the one  initially referred to my wife by the manager.

My wife and I finished our purchase and I walked out of there feeling a little bad for the original associate. To be honest the more I thought of it, the more I was actually thinking of canceling the order. Just because it didn’t feel right and I felt like the value of me as a customer was deminished. That is was all about the sale. From the pressure of having to seal the deal the day I went in, to the day we did show to finalize and being told the commission would be split. It’s going to take a while to feel good about wanting to do future business there... Especially if that’s the way the sales team treats each other and their customers. There’s plenty  of business to go around for all the sales associates. And to squabble over a commission didn’t make me feel good as a customer.</review>

Fell in love with the highlands poster bed online but needed to see it in person before we were comfortable making the purchase online. The staff was very helpful and answered all of our questions. The delivery time frame and communications were just as expected. Everything on time and as promised. Love the bed and looking forward to acquiring the other pieces in the set!< /text>

I love the couch we ordered and really appreciate the help our sales lady was able to give us in order to match pillows with it that we absolutely love.  She was very informative on mattresses which we purchased too.  Our new mattress is heavenly.  Totally glad we decided on a mattress too.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>We recently went shopping for a new sofa.  We had heard from our neighbor (Alameda) that he had a good experience with Bassett Furniture in Dublin.  So we made the trek out there and met Nancy Johnson in the showroom.  Nancy helped us select a sofa walking through all the options.  She was meticulous at getting our order exactly how we wanted it giving good advice along the way.  Our sofa arrived in just a few short weeks and was delivered just when they said it would be.  We couldn't be happier with our sofa and the friendly, professional customer service provided by Nancy.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d9451131093137:0xe2a36cc89d879920<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amanda was a delight to work with. However the sofa ended up being not the sofa I intended it to be. We had a misunderstanding as to the style and I ended up with a fabric that I love and a sofa style I hate. Part my fault for not double & triple checking the order before it was placed but thought I had made it clear as to the style I wanted. But the service was great, the time frame was perfect and Amanda did check to see how the order was progressing.< /review>

Nice and cozy little place with great food and service.  One person in our party was a vegetarian and had no problems fining a couple options to choose from.  Great wine list and nice sized portions.  Our server was very familiar with the menu and made some great recommendations.  Can't wait to go back.< /Review>

Great spot if you're dining alone. Varied menu, and my waiter suggested some side dishes to make my soup and salad dinner very special. Try the mocktails, try the milk bread, definitely wish I'd tried this spot earlier in my trip. Great for kids too!<//Review>

Great service, good food, and family friendly. Had a fantastic server, Sebastian, who was so great with my two kids. The kids portions are large and reasonably priced. I had the burger and it was very flavorful and filling. The waffle with pork belly was wonderful and even my daughter like it.</text>

<Review>Good place to grab a drink and bite. Food quality is good, but it's pricey for the portions served. Stays pretty busy since it's part of the Hilton. Good service too, would recommend for a casual night or dinner with colleagues.<//Review>< pictures>

We shared some appetizers: a chorizo dish, an octopus dish, and one with pimento cheese and crackers. All were pretty good. I ended up choosing the bibimbap which was good but not traditional as it wasn't crispy on the bottom. My boyfriend got the chicken dish and you get such a great serving size!</Text>< pictures>

<text>I decided to eat here due to it being at my hotel. I made the right choice. When you walk in, you’ll notice a hipster atmosphere. It’s not bad or anything, but you might not expect it. The menu might also come of as strange for people who aren’t used to very hipster style food. Luckily, I’m used to it. I ordered the 8 hour bolognese. When they slow cook tagliatelle for 8 hours, you know that it’s gonna be good! It was surprisingly one of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had! Plus, the fries are OUTSTANDING (I tried my dad’s fries). However, DO NOT SKIP DESSERT! All of them are incredible. I got the Coconut-Guava Roche. It’s basically coconut and guava mousse with bits of tapioca and gelatine. It was AWESOME! So was my brother’s S’mores Sundae (marshmallow flavoured ice cream with toasted marshmallows and graham crackers) and my parents’ Carrot Cake (not what you’d expect a carrot cake to look like, but don’t let it fool you!)! I will have to recommend Urban Tavern to everyone I know. You’ll love it!< /text>< Date>

KJ killed it with fast and humorous customer service. Best burger I and companion have had in YEARS! Friend had wine; excellent cab sauv and my draft beer was fresh and flavorful. Dessert was a tad expensive but presentation was lovely. All in all, a real boon after a 5 hr flight from Toronto.< /Text>

What an unexpected surprise.  Entered with the intent of a quick bite.  Was treated to amazing food, the bass was out of this world,  served by knowledablge and attentive staff.  Like seriously one of the best meals I've had while dining out in quite some time.  I will be visiting again before I have to head back home.
EDIT: I ate there three nights in a row and each meal was outstanding (could be a little more generous with portions, but I'm a fat Midwesterner).  Enjoy :)</Text>

Very noisy.  5 of us sat at the round table in the front corner and it was virtually impossible to have a conversation.

Service was good. Food was pre cooked. Rice was undercooked to most standards, the steak was dry and the Bibimbap's  cucumbers had a softness that suggested the weren't fresh. So hence the 2x 🌟 for the service and 0 🌟 for the food. Not to mention UT is in the expensive range.<//Text>

This gastropub offers very delicious spins on surprisingly healthy dishes (unhealthy dishes are also available), as well as a solid array of cocktails, wine, and local craft beers. The octopus is a very well crafted and highly recommended dish, and the shishito peppers are filled with ample flavor.< /Review>

<Review>Service was slow for the money being spent, food was good, but not exceptional.    I picked one of the most expensive items on the menu, the boneless ribs & it honestly tasted pretty identical to the "heat & eat" pot roast meal I buy for my whole family at Costco for $11.99.   My coke I ordered hardly had any ice in it & never got refilled. It would take a lot of convincing to get me to return.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The environment is cozy and staff polite. Positive experience.

A minus star is due to my beef be too much cooked when I asked medium. Good portion size (not extremely big).</review>

We orders Blistered Shishito peppers, the Burrata and the Urban burger.
Some of the peppers were good but most didn't have enoth blisters and tasted just like raw peppers. The Burrata was a weird combination of prosciutto (I think), burrata cheese, toasts and greens (with balsamic viniger). The burger and the bun each fell apart realy fast while eating.

Overall it cost 50$ and wasn't worth it<//review><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Nice place and good service.  Only reason I am giving two stars is that I ordered a flight of beers at $10.  The bill came and I paid with a $20.. no change from the staff.  Eventually had to ask for my change which I find unprofessional and rude..  Still tipped the man $3.00 but really did you think I was actually tipping you at %100 rate?  Felt like a scam which should not be happening at upscale establishment..< /review>

Sometimes as a moral vegetarian you crave a burger and deeply regret your decision thinking "ugh, what a waste of a burger". Other times, you randomly discover urban tavern with that craving and consider a return to an omnivorous diet because the Urban Burger is so damn good!! Also got the mushroom ragout which was an amazing medley of mill valley fungus that really put a cap on the meal. Unfortunately declined the dessert but eager to try the options!< /Text>

Went for dinner. 50% off bottle of wine as guest of Hilton. Wait staff excellent and made the meal. Menu has a lot of fusion and limited variety. Have had better food but was ok. Would like to see a bit more traditional pub food. Falls short on authenticity in the Korean fare. Not a bad layout, get both at back if you want quieter.< /Text>

The overall atmosphere was as the name itself implies with modern, hip decor. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, but unfortunately this did not carry over to the food. The menu was limited and overpriced, even for a Hotel based Restaurant. The rib eye steak (supposedly painted hills farms)  was ordered medium well ,and on first presentation was thin, completely overdone and burned at the edges. For the price tag of close to $40, was disappointing to say the least. This was sent back, while my Fiance' ate her meal alone. 20 minutes later, the second attempt arrived......in the same condition, another thin rib eye steak, over cooked. This was made minimally tolerable by a decent glass of wine on the house. Overall, we would not eat here again. There are too many options nearby, where $100.00 will buy a much higher quality dinner.</Text>

Not sure why this restaurant only gets 3.5 stars..? We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Urban Tavern. Food was excellent (big portions) and service was outstanding. We had the quinoa and roasted beet salad and the onion soup for appetizers, both were fantastic. The beer battered fish and chips were the best I've had. The fish was super fresh and moist, the beer batter light and flavorful. My wife had the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes. It was also really good. Had the 14 layer chocolate cake for dessert...WOW!!! So moist and delicious! Great bottle of wine as well. We will definitely recommend and go back as soon as we can.< /Review>

Nice bar and restaurant. The first time I cam was for a company party. We got to use a private room in the back, had our own bar, and a great selection of heavy appetizers. The sliders were really good and so were their cheese rolls and desserts. Since then I've been a couple times for drinks and they were great. Plus the ambiance is fun and the staff is friendly.<//Review>

Steak was WAY overdone and even had it been served how I asked was not seasoned well. The pork dish is stellar but the only one anyone aty table really liked.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Best salmon I've ever had in 40+ years of traveling the world.  And not the most expensive.  Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting San Francisco.</Text>

If you're staying at this hotel, IMO this is the best and closest eatery. Prices are a bit expensive, but nothing egregious. Food is delicious. Their salads and side dishes are 👌</Review>

Food is very tasty and they have a good selection of beers on tap and a great selection of mixed drinks. Just a bit pricier than the norm because its attached to the hotel, but worth it.</text>

<text>Sign outside of entrance (inside hotel) showed many breakfast options. However, once I walked in I was told only the buffet was available. "Cold" continental breakfast buffet was 27 dollars, "Hot" continental breakfast buffet was 32 dollars. Kudos to the waitress for being understanding, and explaining that when it is all said and done check would be 50 bucks.

I went someplace else :)< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Excellent food- the smashed fries, chicken fried mushrooms,  jidori chicken and far-east snickers bar desert are fantastic.  Best service I've had anywhere... ask for KJ, she is beyond knowledgeable of the food and so personable!</review>

Took 20 minutes to get seated with zero line. Finally got our seats and realized the restaurant was a buffet. No biggie till I realized the buffet had all of 4 choices for food, not counting salads. Drinks were brought by an uninterested waitress ... 14 bucks for a Moscow Mule, the second of which I eventually had to procure on my own at the bar. The food was bland, at best, and all for the low low price of 150 bucks for two people.

I know of a Subway on Polk with not only better food, but better service. No exaggeration. The view was nice, though ... that's worth the one star. Seriously though, there are so many good places to eat in SF, go anywhere else. Literally anywhere. I wouldn't go back again if my meal was free.<//Text>

A little pricey, but average for San Francisco. Had the burger. It was okay, I mean it's a burger. Fries were a bit soggy for my taste. Wished they had been a bit more crisp. Bar staff was friendly.</text>

<text>Was a little unsure about eating here due to eating on Google. After eating here, I wish we had came sooner. It was delicious, our waiter was fantastic, I got the burger with egg, my wife had the salmon and we had the milkbread appetizer.

We have been here 5 nights, this was the best meal by far. The salmon was excellent, the burger easily the best I had while in SF. The milkbread, don't miss out on this, you have to try it.

Great experience, excellent dinner and atmosphere. Thank you.<//text>< Rating>

I didn't even realize this place is part of the Hilton until I began the very long journey to the restrooms which took me through the lobby, around corners, and down long halls. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance with a huge industrial-like horse sculpture in the center of the place which also serves as the restaurant's logo. I thought the place could have used a little music, however.

We had the 1/2 chicken and the ribeye. While the food isn't particularly anything to write home about, it was certainly good. I'd give Urban Tavern a solid 3.5 stars, but I'll round it up to four because our waiter was attentive and friendly as can be!< /review>

Good beer and wine selection but ehhh on the food. Very pricey and small portions. A pricey bowl of Bolognese comes small with no salad and not even a side of bread. I  a pinch try it but not a destination.</Review>

A bit pricey (and I was considering either doing a 3 or a 4 based on price alone), but the burger was solid and the servers are really nice. Burger was nice and juicy and really darned delicious. The burger was not that pricey for a upscale-feeling restaurant ($11), but I thought the $5 black coffee was a bit much. I'm in the area for a convention this week, but I think I'm going to go across the street to Naan and Curry or Chipotle.< /Text>

< review>
We came here for a surprise birthday brunch and were able to secure a bunch of tables in the back. The downside to getting the tables in the back was that it's right next to where the restaurant connects with the hotel next door, which is also the only way to get to the restrooms that the restaurant uses.

The drinks were flowing, however there was hardly any alcohol in the drinks... Huh? This is brunch. And we're in SF. That's just not cool. Bloody Mary's tasted like liquid pizza, and my mojito tasted like liquid Dentyne.

As far as food goes, it was OK. My BF ordered the 0.5lb burger, and I got the salmon chopped salad. I didn't think the salmon had much flavor to it, and the vinaigrette wasn't anything special. The burger was actually really tasty. I really got a taste of the meat, which I appreciate. The burger came with a side of shoe-string fries which were tossed with sauteed onions. They were really tasty.

Overall, this place OK. I can understand why it's attached to a hotel, as I'm sure it is easy to please the masses with it's medium-sized menu. I probably wouldn't spend the money myself to come back here.

I just want to add that our waiter (the older one that is from Barcelona) was absolutely hilarious. We'd come back for him, and that's it.</review>

<Review>Short on time, we opted to have dinner at Urban Tavern, the restaurant housed within the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. It was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Being greeted & seated was pretty instantaneous, but I would recommend sitting farther away from the street entrance during the winter months - a draft blows in every time someone opens the door.  Service was above average. Our waiter was friendly, and when food allergies were mentioned, he checked with the kitchen twice to make sure the selections made were a-okay to consume.

I ordered the half chicken, which came with a side of green veggies (broccoli, I think) and mashed potatoes. It cost $24, which isn't too different from NYC prices, so that wasn't too out of this world for me. My dining companion ordered the fish & chips and that entrée looked pretty tasty - flakey fried fish, and thickly-cut potato wedges. The chicken was a hearty portion, and well-cooked. There was some gravy on it, and I used that to flavor up the sides.

If in the area again, I would definitely visit Urban Tavern.< /Review>< Resp>

They validate up to 5 hours if you park in hotel's garage. I would park there and just buy a drink at the bar if you plan to spend some time in downtown.<//Text>< name>

< review>
I've eaten here a couple times, once for lunch during a conference and most recently, for a pre-show dinner.

Now that I know how good the food is and close to theaters, I'll be sure to come back.

I'm recently vegetarian and I eyed the vegetarian papardelle pasta and instead opted to get the chile cheddar biscuits with honey butter and the little gem chopped salad with radishes and asparagus. It was definitely a rich combo and filling. I paired my meal with a Kentucky mule -- Bulleit whiskey with ginger beer and sparkling wine. It was rather refreshing!

For dessert, I debated between the "beeramisu" and the 14-layer cake. I opted for the latter at the server's recommendation ($4 more at $12). It was definitely monstrous but not as decadent or chocolatey as I would have hoped. There was too much buttercream and I would have liked more cake. Next time I'll go for the peanut butter cup or snack cake treats.</review>

Extremely poor service by the bartender. Customers seemed to be an annoyance to him. Waited 20 minutes for service in a bar with 6 customers. Gave up and went elsewhere.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The service was very good, but the wine was at room temperature (warm), I ordered mussels (rich but a little spicy for the sauce) and my husband ordered meat (small portion and nothing dazzling)

Nick and his team are great. I've gone to them three years running and they are meticulous, fast, informative and responsive. Out of several CPAs and other tax prep methods I've tried, they are definitely the best I have encountered. 11/10, would recommend.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Kimberly was great, she communicated everything in detail and was friendly and knowledgable. Nick on the other hand... was difficult to work with, did not listen to our company's needs, was condescending and did not provide any value to the goals we were hoping to achieve. Fortunately we were able to find another accounting firm that wanted the work.< /Review>

I highly recommend using CPA Corner for your audit and tax needs.  We have used them for years and been very happy.  I had submitted our books and my calculations for gross profits was very different from what CPA Corner said.  I "argued" a bit thinking I was right but in the end I redid my calculations and I had been wrong.  This error they found saved us paying ~$10K in taxes.  They truly work to make sure clients pay taxes that are necessary and no more.</Review>

We have used The CPA Corner for six years.  Nik and Kimberly have been a pleasure to work with.  My husband passed away in 2019 and they have been  very helpful helping me navigate the legalities.< /Review>

CPA corner firm is a great and helpful firm that I am using right now. Mrs Kim and her team is very knowledgeable about tax. I had asked her to help me out with my business tax and personal in a short period of time. She was willing to help and resolve everything to me. I am truly happy with their service and communication. Thank you< /Review>

After spending an hour with Nick in a consultation about my business and personal tax, I decided I will be filing taxes with his company.  Nick was very knowledgeable and very helpful.  He explained things clearly.  Nick answered all my questions, and advise me on specific business structures.   I feel more confident regarding tax laws after talking to Nick.  I would highly recommend The CPA Corner Firm.< /review>

They remind me when I need to upload documents to start my tax return, I submit everything online on their secure, easy-to-use site, and they call me within a business day if I'm missing anything or to answer questions. It's good to know that Nick and Kimberly always have their client's best interests in mind -- thank you Kimberly for giving me a call before tax season started to get me prepared and answering all my questions in regards my 401K and IRA!</text>

<Date>1581723797205< /Date><resp>None</resp><Review>I found The CPA Corner online, after searching for trustworthy and legitimate accountants to handle mine and my husband's complex tax case. Upon calling, I spoke to Kim, who spent around 15 mins of her time on the phone with me to discuss in detail the complexity of my taxes; Kim was more than willing to help and referred my husband and I to Nick.

After spending an hour with Nick in a consultation, we decided to file our taxes same day. Nick was personable, educational, enthusiastic and overall optimistic regarding our situation; in a normal case where we might have ended up owning, we left with a pretty substantial refund. I'm extremely happy with the services Nick provided and will only continue to do business with The CPA Corner. Thanks guys!</Review><gmapID>0x80dcdd1cdeeb1189:0xf1e66f57972d7611<//gmapID>< user_name>

<review>Nick is super helpful and reliable. He helped me on getting back my tax refunds at a reasonable price. I've asked many CPA to help me with my case but they all rejected due to its complexity, but Nick accepted it because he knows what he is doing. I really appreciate his work and effort.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Nick & his team are fantastic!  My business partner and I use him for our two businesses as well as personal taxes and he has done wonders to ensure we are doing all we can within the rules of the IRS.  He has also helped us be more proactive and plan so there are no surprises and we are well prepared.  They are so responsive and helpful.  I couldn't be happier!< /Review>

<Text>I've used certain websites and programs to do my taxes myself for years just to save money and have never been satisfied with the results.  After working with CPA Corner for my taxes this year, for the first time ever, I finally have a good feeling after filing. I actually look forward to working with CPA Corner next year. The people here are patient, honest, professional and very knowledgeable. This was a great experience.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I have used the same CPA since 1994. She was based in Arizona where I use to live. Even after moving back to California I would still mail her all my paperwork and she would complete my taxes. Last year I had started a Corporation and thought it was time to find a CPA closer to me here in California.

After searching for many CPA’s in my surrounding area and reading many reviews, I decided to give Nick from The CPA Corner my business. Let me tell you, I definitely made the right choice. He prepared my taxes for my corporation and my personal taxes.

Nick and his staff are very professional and friendly. Nick explained everything and answered every question that I asked. I was really stressed about finding a new CPA since I’ve had used the same one for the pass 23 years. Thank you Nick for easing that stress.

No short cuts, no hidden fees, no hassle filing, detailed and organized!  Sadly, I paid legal zoom about $1K to mess up my life and cheat me.  Even though I'm paying Nick, he's getting it done correctly and he has easy quick steps to follow.  I'm not the most internet literate person around, so his step by step guidance works wonders for me.  At the same time, I know exactly what is going on with my taxes and financials.   There's no middle man, so you deal directly with Nick.  I like this because it keeps the cost down.   I also want to highlight his hospitality!  Never have I been to an accounting firm that offers food and drinks during the visit.   I'm extremely comfortable with Nick. I've been cheated a few times before, last time was Legal Zoom!  I wish I found Nick before Legal Zoom.  I hope my review will help you find peace of mind when you schedule that consultation.  You will be agreeing with me when you leave his office!</Review><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I highly recommend Nick and the CPA Corner for accounting services, especially for tax preparation. I have a personal independent contractor account, and I also opened up a new S-corporation business last year, prepared with a previous accountant, and this previous accountant botched it (i.e. incorrectly calculating my W2 statement, misspelling my name and address on important documents, unnecessary fees for unnecessary meetings and corporation items). Nick and his team were like a breath of fresh air. He and his team clarified and helped me untangle the situation and Nick did an amazing job in explaining what was wrong and helping me figure it out. I’m really new to this business world and was very intimidated, but Nick and his team were very patient with me and explained everything. They also helped me find a lot of deductions from my taxes and saved me a lot of money. Without them I feel like I would be paying so much more in taxes. Nick was quick to identify The problems I had and fast to respond with a solution. They also communicated with me so well with phone calls/emails to follow up and give reminders for due dates and updates on my accounts.

What I loved most about The CPA Corner:
- Fast communication
- Time efficient
- Private file sharing program
- Clarity
- Reasonable fees< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Nick Pham is a professional who has clarified and handled my taxes, ran multiple scenarios to explain certain points and made recommendations. As a business owner for 15+ years I finally feel comfortable in the explanations brought forward. He  was able to share his knowledge and translate them in simple terms. Up to date with the tax laws I feel comfortable working with Nick and the team at CPA Corner.< /Review>

Nick is a great accountant. He is very detailed, professional and experienced. Every year for the last six years I've been owing money to the IRS because my prior accountant either was not experienced or did not bother doing his job. Since I've been coming to Nick for my taxes, He's already saved me so much money. First time in years I am actually getting a check from the state tax. He sits with you and explains all the details of your taxes and what he will do to save you money.<//text>

<review>Just a note to say thanks to Nick and the team at the CPA Corner. After a couple rough years with our old CPA, we brought our company tax problems and legal entity issues to Nick. Nick and the team have a very professional and thorough process which identified many mistakes that had cost us a LOT of money and we were headed for more trouble. I'm happy to say all of our issues are now resolved thanks to Nick and the team and I'm able to report to our leadership team with confidence our tax and legal compliance issues from the past are resolved. I can't say enough about the great work from the team at the CPA Corner. If you are looking for a CPA or Legal Entity partner, look no further.</review><date>1554411320059</date>< rate>

<Text>Nick and his staff have been fabulous. They know the laws and fought hard for our 2 IRS Audits. They won both our audits saving us almost 100K in what the IRS was erroneously trying to say we owed. They will be doing all of our tax returns every year from now on to be sure we have everything in proper order. Much cheaper than a tax Atty!!!

It is often said to have a good doctor, lawyer, mechanic and accountant.  I found my account and I would recommend him to others.  If I had a time machine I would have hired him years ago.

I've appreciated the professional and personal care we have received very much!

I had large amount tax return check since I found him,
and even he recheck my last two years tax return, which were from another accountants, and I got huge money back from the mistakes.
😀

If you are interested in a CPA certified accountant, I would like to recommend his services to my friends and family for all their accounting needs, because he does the speed and efficiency.

He is very capable and knowledgeable, I plan to make use of his services in the future, and I am happy to referral him to all my friends.<//Review>< Pics>

Mr. Nick Pham at the CPA Corner - went to my file and pointed out every single details that related to a foreigner (in this case Canadian) working in California with incomes from both Canada and the US. He walked me through various issues, as if he was a tour guide in the tax matrix. Since I had some accounting background, Nick's service serves as a delicious mental meal for me.

I strongly recommend anyone resident or not, any foreigner working in the US to come to his service. You will have another pleasant 5-star experience to be shared among your friends and colleagues.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< user_name>

Nick and his team at the CPA corner were awesome. I was  overwhelmed by all my tax stuff because I am self-employed but they walked me through want I needed to do and they were friendly and kind. They are now my official CPA and I look forward to working with them for many years to come!!!<//review>

<Review>We had a very positive experience with Mr. Nick Pham. Very professional, competent and customer oriented. Always transparent, he explains us every single step that any process would require
In addition of filing taxes, we filed an ITIN for my wife and it was a very smooth process. We are now filing for tax amendment for a previous year and, again, Nick is doing an excellent job.
His staff is also great, easy to communicate with and always available.
Couldn’t be more happy and will definitely keep coming to The CPA Corner for anything tax related.</Review>< Pictures>

The CPA-Corner and Nick Pham saved me from a very scary situation.  Nick was very accommodating, knowledgeable, but most importantly very honest.  He tells you exactly what you need to know and what needs to be done for the best outcome in any situation.  Whether it be your yearly tax filing services or any audit situations.  I am so grateful to have found Nick and will continue to use his services for years to come.</Review>

I have to say this firm is very unprofessional. Their phone response time is 24 hours. Ridiculous. You have to play phone tag. And the lady on the phone is extremely rude. I asked to speak to Nick and she kept being very rude saying we are book so we can’t help you. So as have now they are not accepting new clients. Move on to the next. Many CPA’s out here.< /Review>

Stop looking any further and just leave your stress and headache about your taxes on The CPA Corner and let Nick take care all of that for you.
Dose it sound like a commercial advertisement to you? :D
Definitely … no marketing, no advertising or anything likes that on this review.
5 Stars because he deserved it.

I found out about The CPA Corner through Yelp and Google and based on the great reviews I decided to call Nick to help me out on my personal tax since my accountant guy left me without any responses when I sent him my audit letter that I got from IRS.

I had a complicated issue on my personal tax 2013 and it related to 2014 due to my previous accountant’s mistake. My previous accountant claimed I was an owner  - owning a business, in fact I was not in 2013 - causing not only the IRS but also my County put a question on me later on in 2015 for the reason that they didn’t get my California filing tax return and my business profit & loss statement for 2014.
*In 2014, I moved to Illinois to start my first time business. Obviously I didn’t have any income in California so I didn’t have to pay any taxes there legally, but I did pay all my taxes for Federal and Illinois State. Long story short, in the situation of being audited I was so frustrate, I didn’t know what to do and how to fix all the problems. Luckily, I found Nick, he looked at my tax returns from 2012 to 2014 and he saw the big mistake from my previous accountant. He then helped me filed an amendment for my 2013 taxes and included proof of that I didn’t have any business in 2013. After almost 3 months, my case was successes. I even got money back from IRS. Happy…

And this year Nick helped me on my business and personal income taxes. Everything went smooth…

It has never been easy to find a knowledgeable and professional CPA to work on your tax return…. I’m so glad to have Nick beside for my business and personal taxes. Even though I haven’t met him yet, (everything we worked on phone and emails) but I can tell he is easy to work with, quick and responsive to questions- within 24 hours you will get his answers if you have any questions for him.
Needless to say, I will go with Nick from now on for any other tax matters.

Thank you Nick, I appreciate all your hard work.< /text>

<Review>I found Nick Pham - The CPA Corner Inc on Yelp review about a month ago and he has been nothing but great.  Nick is very through about the process and responds  to phone calls and emails promptly.  His website interface is easy to use and secure.  We had our taxes filed before the deadline in less than 2 weeks, the delay was my fault.  I definitely will continue to work with Nick.  Thanks Nick!<//Review>< Pictures>

In one word, - Nick is amazing! His team and himself did a great job for my 2016 Tax Preparations and 2015 Tax Audit. I am very happy my friend recommend him to me. His profession working method gives me great impression. After he accepted my case, he had two meetings with IRS and he is one of the most trustable and respectful CPAs in this area. I strongly recommend him to my friends.< /review>

Nick went above and beyond our expectations and helped us resolve the case in a timely manner. We had a complicated tax situation, kind of urgent and chaotic. He guided us through the whole process and with his thorough knowledge and skills, he saved our lives. He is quick, reliable and a trusted CPA. He becomes our accountant now.< /Review>

<userid>105682292986252073827< /userid><Name>Alex Do< /Name><Text>I usually did my tax return every  year through Turbo Tax. However, this year, my tax became very complicated due to stock tradings and multiple incomes. I tried to file with Turbo Tax but after a few days with hundreds of tax forms, I was overwhelmed with all the numbers. Seeing how much I had to pay more to IRS, I was panicked so I looked around for a professional CPA to help me. Since there was only a month left, no one would help me with all of my crazy tax papers. I was hopeless when I called Nick Pham. Luckily, he agreed to help me right away even though he was super busy. He spent many days working on my complicated papers and corrected more than 60 errors I made in the return statements and saved us thousands of dollars. Without Nick's help, I am sure I would be in trouble with the IRS.
Nick is very professional and responsive. He would call or email me right away if he discovered anything on my tax returns. I am a very picky and punctual person so I expect lots of transparency and prompt responses from professional services, and Nick meets all of my expectations.
I'd definitely work with him again on my next tax return.< /Text>< rate>

< review>
I was dealing with serious medical issues not to mention I had not completed my taxes for 2014 in December 2015.  Needless to say my stress levels were through the roof.

I reached out to Nick at the CPA Corner and he took care of everything for me.  All I had to do was email over my tax paperwork and after only a few questions Nick had completed my taxes for me within two days.

Not only did he complete my taxes very quickly and seamlessly, but he also saved me over $1,300.

Nick made my financial stress levels go away so that I could focus on my health.

I appreciate all that he has done for me and HIGHLY recommend his services to anyone interested in a CPA who goes above and beyond to take care of his clients.<//review>

<text>I went in to see Nick Pham at the CPA Corner after searching many CPA's in the area. Nick was courteous and informative over the phone so I agreed to pay a consultation fee to see him for an hour. Nick asked me several questions before starting the consultation and wanted to find out that he was the right fit for me before the session began. Although I only paid for an hour session he met with me for over an hour and a half. This has been the most helpful consultation I have received to date while starting up my business. He is extremely well connected and wasted no time getting me to the right people to help me with my business. I will definitely be using his services to start my business because of his experience in starting up businesses. He also helps new business owners in creating a business plan, reviewing documents, and other areas where a new business owner might not be knowledgeable, all at an affordable rate.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>If you have tax problems, CPA CORNER will solve that. Mr. Nick Pham is the main man. He's the nicest & empathetic person you'll meet. Their services are honest to goodness, non judgmental and never take advantage of you. This is why I was so eager to make this review because they deserved to be appreciated. Since the time we started filing for an income tax, we tried to avoid being prepared by a tax accountant due to hearing people's stories that they are expensive. We used turbo tax each tax filing. But this year, I am in trouble with taxes. Here, there, and everywhere IRS is really looking for ways to tax whatever you made whether a loss or a gain. That may mean you can’t getaway without paying more taxes for sure, I was so worried about owing thousands to the IRS and I might not be able to pay it because My husband is the only one working for the entire family. We have more than 5 dependents. Financial priorities and household budget are too tight. We do not have enough money. But my problem couldn't solve on its own. I was worried that if I use turbo tax with my tax problem, I might get into so much trouble by paying more & I might be missing things that Could've saved me money. So, I had to seek help from the tax expert & luckily I found The CPA Corner. I first booked a consultation and it went so well that I learned many things that I never would have known about taxes. They are very updated about tax laws, newly signed laws  that sometimes the tv news forget to report. Mr. Nick Pham, the managing partner of the office acknowledged my problems, found the solution and worked on helping me solving my problem. He's very knowledgeable & expert in this area. After endorsing him my tax problem, I was stress free, had peace of mind & worry free. And when I finally received the completed tax documents for review before filing it, I was shocked that CPA corner saved me from paying too expensive tax fees. It was such a relief! I even have an expected refund which I never thought I would because of our huge taxes. Just prepare & gather all your tax documents even those receipts from donations. He will not make up digits to fill in your tax return because he will not falsify your return with fake numbers. As much as possible, you have to avoid getting audited by irs. But with all datas  you provide, he will figure out where to insert them in every blank corners of your return to help you save tax fees. Hiring  CPA Corner to prepare your tax return may cost more than you pay for the Turbo Tax but I assure you, it is worth every dime. You'd be sleeping well at night knowing your tax return is well taken cared of, done the right way & saved you so much from paying extra tax fees. CPA corner definitely helped me with trouble & solved my tax problem. So when you're in trouble with taxes, do not hesitate to drop by CPA Corner. There is no tax problem they can't solve. I highly recommend it. aside from their tax services, the reason why you'd want to work with them is because you are treated as a valued client. Kim in the front desk is awesome! She greets you with smile & very welcoming. I just hope that this review will help you figure out in looking for good tax accountants and find better ways to solve your tax problem.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Nick Pham and his firm, The CPA Corner, are the best CPA firm that we've ever used!

Rapid responses but more important extremely careful and runs audit checks to protect us in triggering those flags  unnecessarily on our tax returns.

Very patient with me, which another CPA might be offended otherwise as my micromanaging because I value 'Inspect what you Expect.'

What makes Nick's skills with friendliness so great is I always catch myself as the weak link rather than him when I challenge an item or deduction he did for us.  I even learned how I was shortchanged with previous CPA's (just because it was quicker for them not to check) in having our state refund as nontaxable to our next year's federal tax return, when all we needed to take is the standard deduction rather than itemize in our Schedule A.

Nick and his firm are a valuable asset for our businesses and our family.  We plan to do business with him for life.  To anyone else considering hiring him to prepare your taxes, your search just ended.</Review>< pics>

Discovered Mansaf only at DishDash. Didn't know such a dish existed until I checked out this chain of restaurants. Mansaf is simply amazing with the yogurt sauce and tender lamb. I've ordered it every single time I visit. If you get it as a takeout, take precaution to not shake it too much during transport, you don't want the entire rice soaked in the sauce. Only con is everything is a bit pricey here.< /Text>

<UserId.>112423544387816171712<//UserId.><Review>Yesterday (Saturday May 1) my family and I went here for lunch.  We haven't been back since January and my daughter was craving their yogurt sauce.  We've been coming here since they opened here in North San Jose.  We ordered 2 plates: chicken shawarma with freekeh, falafel balls and hummus. and a plate of chicken kebab with everything separate (for my daughter), freekeh with falafel and fries.

I'm not sure if the stars aligned or the energies of the universe got channeled nearby or if it was the beginning of my daughter's birthday month, but the food was exceptional! Really really good.

The chicken shawarma was excellent, my daughter ate 2 servings of the kebab, the hummus was light and delicate!  However the standout for us where the falafel balls, they were just outstanding.  On this day they were not like any other day, they were hot and airy golden balls of goodness today.  Paired with their Chipotle tahini sauce and a little garlic yogurt sauce they were incredible.

Now that I know how the meal can be at Dish N Dash I'm a little disappointed at all the other meals we've had here.  I hope to come back soon and see if they can maintain this high level of quality food.

I will definitely keep you advised either way!

My only one tiny draw back was that the state is still under COVID restrictions, limited indoor seating and you have to ask for everything including little itty bitty portions of their sauces (that we would normally drink while we dined).

Overall I would recommend and I hope you have as wonderful an experience as my family and I had here.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The food was super delicious. A different type then I normally would eat but this was extremely yummy!!! The garlic sauce was super good and normally I wouldn't like that. They did great making sure we were set to eat our yummy pick-up order. They motivated me to take a chance trying new foods. I recommend trying them out for a great experience. 👍<//text>

Good location, usually not crowded, but can be slow. Good choice of beer, TVs everywhere inside and outside, friendly staff, and good Mediterranean food as always. All dishes are good. Can look overpriced, but portions big enough.< /Text>

Whenever I am craving Mediterranean food, dish n dash is the first place that comes to mind. The quality of their food is fantastic. I usually get the falafel wrap with a side of garlic dip and fries. Their cauliflower wings are very good too. One of the things I love most about this place is the variety of sauces. I usually get one of each on the side and it makes each bite of food a unique experience!</review>

High quality food, tastes healthy and delicious.
I get the chicken shawarma here.
One of the best things, though, was the nice patio they have for outdoor dining.
Unfortunately the fascists in Sacramento have decided they know better and thats not allowed now.
Still worth it getting take out though.< /Text>

<review>Really good! I wish they had a few more items on the menu but other than that, it was a really good. The line was long but it moved fast and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Definitely recommend this place. They have TVs everywhere, even outside. Nice clean place and they even have a bar!</review>< Pictures>

<text>Only upto 2 extra pita breads are given for free... staff spoke spanish, barely understood english.

1. Food was nice, I had chicken shawarma with hummus, rice and babaganoush. It was good, but the shawarma was a little dry
2. The menu is a little confusing, but the staff helped me navigate their setup.
3. Outdoor dining is in their patio. Would visit again to give another chance</text>< pics>

<Review>Firstly, we happened to be walking dogs. This restaurant has a beautiful, dog friendly patio complete with a large tv, sun shade types of umbrellas all over, and lots of patio heaters. In early December, sitting outdoors here was very pleasant! You order your food and pay at the front counter. The cashier was friendly and explained the menu options- having the dish served over salad, in a wrap, over rice or hummus, for example, as well as "styling" options that were essentially toppings to give the dish different twists. The side choices were vast, AND they had a decent beer and wine selection. We were excited to try the fusion combos we had been instrumental in personalizing.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Dish n Dash has become my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Love their falafel and kebabs, very juicy and flavorful. Great appetizer, salads and rice. Definitely try their baklava. They seem to use quality ingredients. Prices are decent given the portion size. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Finding a parking spot could be a hassle on busy days.<//text>

A Slice of the Mediterranean Right Next to Silicon Valley.

There's this place, an quick-service, order at the counter, get your stuff, and sit. And there's another place like this that's a more casual dining, table service place. Both do it well, serve similar foods, and your choice of either should depend on how much you want to be taken care of and how fancy you want to be.

I ordered the Lamb Shwarma ($15), you can get is as a wrap (with toasty lavash) or with pita (that is homemade), it comes with an herb-tahini, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickles, and parsley; and served with a choice of a side (I went with the Lentil soup). Other choices are hummus, fries, tabouli, falafel, salad, rice, babaghanouge, spiced carrots and walnuts, or pomegranate eggplant and walnuts. Also, if you want to go nuts, you can “Style Your Dish” with additional accoutrements for $3 more; I went with the Greek and added roasted bell peppers, grilled onions and mushrooms, and feta cheese. My wife ordered the Falafel Wrap ($12.50), it comes with an tahini, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickles, and parsley; and she got a side of babaghanouge. She styled her dish as Jerusalem and added hummus, grilled eggplant, and cauliflower. As far as Mediterranean food goes, it's one of her favorite cuisines and she said this was in her top two and would eat here once a week. The kids ordered the Chicken Shwarma Wrap ($13.50), it comes with garlic yogurt, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickles, and parsley; and they got a side of rice. They styled it as South of the Border and added black beans, avocado, and cilantro. They were so quiet when they ate; it was a beautiful scene. They loved it.

You have the option of adding additional sauces at their condiment bar: spicy chili, chipotle tahini, Greek yogurt, and/or cilantro lime. All were delicious. My only complaint were dirty pint glasses (check the pic); I ordered two points and both had crusties on the outside. Not a big deal, but a little gross. Overall it was a good experience with good food and I would recommend this place for a gyro, shawarma, or other Mediterranean fix.</text>

We ordered vegetarian food. Instead of ordering wraps or rice places we ordered a lot of sides and appetisers. Our order included: Spinach feta cheese appetiser, rice, vegetables, hummus, garlic dip, falafel, and gelato with baklava as dessert.

The appetiser was simply delicious and we loved it will be an under statement. Falafels were crispy and delicious! Hummus was amazing and my hubby loved it since he is a fan of all things Hummus! Rest of the sides were good and went well with other items. The food was so much in quantity that we had to store half of it(except appetiser and falafel) and eat it next day! Dessert was simply delicious as ice-cream was of premium quality and it went so well with the baklava, highly recommended.</text>

<text>Big place and nice ambiance. Super tasty Middle East food. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken salad plate.  Plenty of seating indoors or outdoors. Place is also suited for project party/meetings and can easily host 20-40 members. Plan for lunch hours as order lines can go vvv long!</text>< username>

<Review>Nice easy going place, staff is very nice, menu has many options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians, prices are more than descent and the draft beer menu is pretty big considered it’s a Mediterranean restaurant.

Great quality and tasty food. A bit expensive. I feel in love with a dish called Mansaf (delicious slow cooked lamb in aged yogurt, served with basmati rice) $20. Also the sauses are very tasty.<//Text>

I was on business trip in SF bay area. My host took me to this restaurant because he know I'm from camel land. You can find there some different dishes from several Muslim oriented cultures in the middle east, slightly adapted to American style. What I tasted was very tasty fresh and close to be authentic. 5 stars speak for itself. The prices were reasonable compared with the bay area. Enjoy< /text>

Occasionally, the order is messed up leaving the customer waiting indefinitely without the food. Not sure if human or computer error that is causing the problem.  But if you wait for too long then check with the front desk.</Text>

<text>What an absolute pleasurable experience. Was my 1st time here and did not know what to expect. I will be back on a regular routine to eat here. The lamb and ground beef kabob pitas were phenomenal! My son was hog wild over the salmon wrap south of the border style!!! Great atmosphere and good prices.<//text><response>None<//response>< time>

Bigger place when compared to the Sunnywale and Fremont locations. Also the lunch bundling is different which is better than the other locations.

But the service could be improved, not very friendly staff at front desk especially during pick ups.</Text>

Great food.  You can get authentic Palestinian food and a mix of other California cuisine. The menu is fantastic there something for everyone. The service is great. Even when the line is long they move it fast. Great place for lunch and they have a nice outdoor seating. Everyone I take there for the first time loves the foods.< /text>

Very nice. I was groaning driving into the parking lot and seeing the line spilling out the door at noon on a weekday.
Little did I know that this was a fast casual setup where you order and pickup from the counter. Yea!!! Also the restaurant is huge inside with the same amount of space outside.
No problem ordering and finding a place to eat the wonderful kabobs and saffron rice. I liked all the dipping sauces and kind of wished some of the sides were in the pump dispensers.
I would definitely come back for a fast delicious casual meal.</review>

Lamb entree is creamy and comforting.  Luscious saffron sauce bathes basmati rice for a surprisingly decadent lunch.</text>

This place fills up really quickly, consider arriving here right after they open (11:30 AM) so you can get a good spot in the parking lot and you don’t have to wait in line 15 minutes to order your food, which doesn’t come out fast either.

For starters we ordered the Spinach Rolls ($6.50) and the Lamb & Beef Sliders ($8.50) which come in large portions. The SPINACH ROLLS come with 3 rolls that could be easily mistaken by a small burrito but TASTE LIKE HEAVEN! The Lamb & Beef Sliders includes 4 sliders, which are the size of about 1/3 of a sandwich. When it comes to taste, the Spinach Rolls win over the Lamb & Beef Sliders by a landslide, but you should try them yourself.

For the main entree I ordered the Salmon Wrap ($15) with a side of Tabouli. Tabouli is always a nice fresh addition to any middle eastern type of food and in this case it didn’t disappoint, which is not what I can say for the Salmon Wrap. The Salmon Wrap comes with a lot of vegetables and the salmon is tasty, once you find it in between all of the veggies. It seems to me that paying $15 USD for an entree is a bit too much considering the ingredients.. If you get Tabouli as a side order, it’s a whooping $5 USD and considering that it’s just a few vegetables, that there’s no waiting service and that you have to clean up your table after you’re finished... It just seems too much for Mediterranean fast food.

The portion size is large for both the appetizers and the entrees, so my suggestion is that you choose to share your order with someone else, unless you are extremely hungry!

As for service goes, it’s all GREAT!</Review><Time>1525745593603</Time></record>

Dish n Dash has several locations in the Bay area.  Operates like a fast food but serves high-quality and delicious Lebanese Middle Eastern food.  Pretty much anything on menu is a sure delight.  Shawarma, falafel and kebabs are the basics to start with.  Lentil soup and salads are excellent.  The food is very flavorful and for those who seek more, a trip to the dips/sauce stand will do it.  I particularly liked the cilantro and yogurt dips. There's often a line to the checkout register (frequent on Friday afternoons when most office goers decide to lunch out too celebrate the coming weekend) but the line moves fast.  Service element is low, prices reasonable, food delicious.</review>

Delicious middle eastern food made with high quality ingredients.
Did not like the dark over air-conditioned inside seating with TV's everywhere, but the outside patio is spacious and shaded.
Service, which consists of ordering at a counter, and having a tray arrive, is cheerful and efficient.  And prices, portions and quality are an excellent value.
Vegetarians will have good options.< /review>

Just as good if not better than the Sunnyvale location. This location has way more seating and has a ton of beers on tap. The food is so good. I got the lamb schwarma with freekah and babaganoush and it was magical. So tender and juicy. Their sauces are delicious as well. Definitely check out the garlic yogurt one!! Dish n Dash is on the expensive side for lunch, especially if you get lamb, but the quality and taste are worth it.<//review>

I love their fish taco! It was one of the best tacos I've tried. The place is small and who knew, in San Jose too. Service was quick, meal was delicious, server also gave us a discount for online order. Been craving for this fish tacos ever since, will have to stop by again soon.</Review>

It was a pretty good experience. We had ordered 4 dishes and all were very tasty.
Falafel was very crispy and with correct ingredients. Rice was properly cooked.
Ambience over there was also lively. You can spend a good lunch time over here.<//text>

Good walk up counter food. We brought our dog and sat outside. Perfect place for a quick bite and enjoying the weather. Inside seating is nice too.

Not as many options for food as their Dish Dash locations, but the food they do have is excellent and served quickly in a nice environment. We'll be back.< /text>

Love this place. The food is made to order and although it’s counter-order, it can take 10-15 minutes to get a buzz that the order is ready. Worth the wait, I’ve found. Very tasty. Love the buffalo cauliflower.< /Review>

This location is very close to many corporate offices on N 1st St. Very good & fresh food with modern sitting arrangement. Very fast service with takeout option. Hot sauce is really good. Little bit expensive. Specious location with enough tables. Gets crowded during lunch time.< /review>

The lines get very long during the week, so you should try to arrive there around 11:30, if not you'll wait in line for a little while. However they are super fast and your food will be ready in less than 5 minutes. Their sauces are delicious, especially the cilantro mint one. All of the food I've tried there is delicious and I highly recommend. It's a little bit pricey, maybe around 15 dollars a plate, but it is well worth it!< /text>

Would give it 3.5 if I could give half stars. I was pleasantly surprised by their selection of beer/wine. Spacious indoors and also great patio space. But the food is average and somewhat overpriced for what it is (ie could get the same dishes with bigger portion at lower price points at other places in the area).<//review>

<review>I can't get enough of Dish N Dash, and judging by the lines, I'm not alone. My favorite dish is the salad with sumac pulled chicken. It's a pretty filling meal. I usually order online for pick-up, which is super easy through their website. Although this location is closest to my office, they don't offer the great shakes and smoothies, so I occasionally drive further so I can have a banana date smoothie with lunch.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Awesome food and ample seating space. The only thing I don't like is the music and the always ON TVs. I would like music on   low and TVs off. Five stars for service and tasteful food.< /text>

I have always like Mediterranean food, dish-dash is a good place to get Mediterranean food. I had the chicken kabak and it did justice to the name. Its wasn't too crowded when I got there at about 6.30, but it got crowded soon after, that's on a Tuesday. Good food, good service.< /Text>

The line can get real long here, going out the door and along the wall, but the wait is worth it because the food is great. They also offer beers on tap to wash down your meal. They is plenty of seating here.</Text>

First time visiting and have no complaints.

While not specifically Turkish or Greek you get food that is common to both/either culture.

The chicken Sharma salad was very tasty.  Chicken was succulent and tasted of Sumac and was served with a corn & edamame salsa that was yum.

The meal comes with some pita bread slices and you are offered some sauces ( I chose tahini & garlic) which were both excellent.

Pricing was fair, food was good and takeout service was fast.</Review>

Nice place for good Mediterranean food. Do try the chicken shawarma over rice, the baklava and biryeni. The food is really awesome even though the price is on the higher side. Portions are good and many dishes can  be sufficient for two people. Only down sides are the difficulty to find a parking spot and finding a table on Fridays can be a real challenge.< /text>

The food is good. This place can get really busy during lunch hours. The lines move really fast and the food comes out quick. This is our go to place for team lunch during work hours. Their humous is my favourite. Nice service and friendly stuff. Definitely try the chicken shawarma<//review>

It's the place to go when you want wholesome Middle Eastern food. Unfortunately the late afternoon sun bounces off car hoods, blinding you while you eat. This restaurant needs blinds, otherwise the food is good.< /review>

The food wasn't super great, but the ambiance in the place is nice. Plenty of seating and clean. Beer menu is pretty run of the mill. No real hitters on there. Hummus was lacking any real flavor and the chicken was just meh. Falafel was pretty decent. There's lots of good middle Eastern food out there, I suggest if you're really looking for the good stuff, maybe pass this place over.</text>

(My only complaint was that the multiple Tv's were at earsplitting volune--but they were willing to turn it down a bit, to 65, at my request.)<//Text>< pics>

If you’re sneaky, you can skip the big line and order your food at the bar. The manager is very friendly and I always feel comfortable bringing clients here for a quick lunch.<//Review>< Pics>

Good and fast Mediterranean place. Any protein over rice is really good and comes with  side so you don't need appetizers. Unique thing about this place is that they have a sort of dressing bar where you can take various dressings to go with food. They also have a good drinks bar.</Review>

<Review>This place has a decent twist to Mediterranean cuisine. It's more upscale and doesn't come close to normal Mediterranean restaurants from an authenticity perspective. The place feels more closely to a sports bar and grill instead</Review>< Rating>

What a great place. The chicken shawarma was moist and flavorful. We could have easily shared one pita wrap or salad between the two of us. They have a nice, dog-friendly patio too!<//text>

<Review>Good fast food take by this Dish n Dash restaurant. Decent taste and ambience. Didn't try their beers so can not comment on that. You order the foods and drinks and they give you a number flag then you choose your table and plant that flag on top of it and they will bring your food. But they will not bring tissues and cutlery. It's your duty to collect them, they are available near the drinks fountain machine.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>Interesting place with an easy-to-navigate menu. Food came up quickly although we weren't there at a busy time, so I'm not sure how service compares during their peak rush times.

The hummus is... different. I'm used to Lebanese flavors and, while not bad, it was just different from what I was expecting.

This place is solidly mediocre, making it a safe choice. I'd go again if a friend were set on it. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to find something else.<//text></record>

Great meditrainian and middle eastern flavors combined with a modern looks, fast service, and delicious dishes. Priced reasonably for the ambiance, quality, and flavors. Also the drink menu is huge and versatile. I would highly recommend this place. There are 4 types of dipping sauce that suit most people from mint to garlic yougurt, chipotle, and chili.</review>

Food was decent, but nothing to make me go back for. Counter service could have been more friendly and helpful for me, the first timer there. Others in my group really liked their meal. Seemed pricey to be as well.<//text>

This is not a full service restaurant, you order the food at the counter and the buzzer will, well, buzz when ready. The food quality is great, the sauces are awesome, especially the garlic yogurt. This is my default place to lunch in weekdays, primarily because its good and close to my office.

Portions were not proportional.  Too much of one ingredient and to little of another.  For example, I ran out of vegetables on my plate long before I ran out of protein choice.  Sauces were all too much trying for odd flavors rather than balancing ones that enhance what is there.< /Review>

We got there fairly late, they were about to close. So the staff was a bit pushy to get us out. This is meant to be a quick bite joint of the larger restaurant. Menu is limited, it's make your own dish.< /Text>

I have been to this place multiple time for lunch and dinner. The food is good and the beer menu is decent. It is good place for grab and go too if you place the order online. Chicken Schwarma salad is great.< /Text>

The food is good but expensive for what you get. Crowded around 11:45 to 1:00 but line moves quickly. Staff is friendly. Wish they had tops for sauce containers. You need to ask for to go sauce with lids. Beer and wine selection is good.< /Text>

<Review>The order takes about 20 to 30 minutes usually and it also has a long line since it's very popular for local business employees.
The food on the other hand, is excellent and worth the money.
It's not too cheap, but not too expensive either.</Review><rate>5< /rate>< pics>

You order at the counter, you find a seat, you wait till your order is ready, then you pick up your meal at the counter, pick up your utensils and your sauces and walk back to your seat.... This restaurant is ran like a "CAFETERIA!!" ....  And have the BALLS TO ASK FOR A TIP?!!!   I ordered the lamb $17. plus, When I went to pick it up at the counter I said to myself what the heck is this???!!!  I thought I was picking up a kid's meal for a 4 year old without the toy!!!!   Grossly disappointed in the portions, I'm a firm believer in if a business is paid by a consumer for their product in full, the consumer should get the value of what they pay for in return and at this dish dash ((( YOU WON'T)))).  I wasn't gonna order another over priced undersized plate so I went to their competitors and bought something else so I could feel satistied. If you work hard for your money and you want your money's worth, this is NOT the place, even if it taste ok.< /Text>

There is usually a wait during weekday lunch, but the line moves pretty quickly. The chicken shawarma salad is delicious, and the sauces that you can add on the side or very good. Service is good, the restaurant is clean, and prices are reasonable. I definitely recommend checking them out.<//text>

The food is always really good with a different options.
Sadly, I feel like the quantity of meat in dishes got reduced recently, which is a shame considering how tasteful it is...<//Review>

<text>Excellent place to have a quick meal. Lines are quite long during lunch on weekdays which is understandable as it attracts office crowd.
Seating options are good too with ample space to sit outside.
I would definitely recommend.< /text>< date>

<rating>4</rating><review>Very good mediterranean good place. Gets pretty crowded for lunch time. Do try the Tabsi falafel, the wraps. The fries are mediocre. Love the freshly squeezed mint lemonade. The baklava is pre packed. Might not be the best. Pretty quick service. We were 10 of us and it took just 20 minutes of wait to get the food for lunch on a Thursday. Pretty close to lots of companies too.</review>< Pics>

Great casual ambiance and go-to place to grab a quick meal.  Serving sizes of the salads and rice plates are huge.  The set up of the menu & options are slightly different from the Sunnyvale Dish-N-Dash location and prices are a tad on the higher side in this SJ location.  The food presentation is definitely on point in this location though, so I guess with that comes higher prices ;)< /Review>

The food is really great! We went in off hours hence there wasn't a huge rush. Outdoor seating is nice and sunny. Tends to get really crowded during lunch hours.</text>

<text>All time favorite Mediterranean menu. Always crowded during meal hours but relatively fast turn around to grab seats. My fav fish here is the Lamb shawarma, topped up w a spicy chilli at the condiment station. Take all these down with a chilled wheat beer and your all set for the next return! Decently priced menu also caters to vegetarian options.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>This dish n dash location is on the strip mall at the intersection of Trimble and north first street. My office is nearby and before they opened there was a dearth of quality places to have good food and quality beer.

During weekends the lunch rush starts at about 12 PM. At the door you will have a bunch of paper menus and you order your food for which you are given a buzzer. You go and grab your table and have to wait for your food to be prepared. When it is done, they will give you a buzz and you can get the food at the counter by giving up your buzzer. The sauce and silverware stand is near the counter too. If you go during the evening, they bring the food to your table.

I usually take the veggies rice plate with salad as a side (you get one side for free) along with the preparation style as Greek (this is an extra charge). I have also tried the same combination with salmon instead of veggies.

For beer, they have multiple options. If you like stouts, I would recommend the dragoons irish stout. You can take a pint or a 9 oz glass. Some of my colleagues prefer the Apple cider, thought it is too light for my taste.

Overall, this place is a good hangout location for some classy yet fast food style Greek/Mediterranean style cuisine.< /text>< Pictures>

Went there for a business meeting with partners from Germany and they had their car broken into in broad daylight. Passports, laptops, etc. all stolen. After talking to other businesses, this crime happens all the time at this location and the property manager still doesn't have security.< /Review>< user>

We had team dinner at this restaurant, where we all loved the food, especially the lamb. The location is close to downtown, so be well prepared for parking.< /text>

Ambience is very good, but food seems to okay as compared to Luna Grill/Other Mediterranean cuisines. I feel it is little hipped place, hence rating it 3.</Review>

<text>Woohoo! I love Dish Dash but my biggest gripe about the place is usually the wait... sometimes I want the food but really just want to grab it and go. This has solved all my problems. The same high quality food with a similar menu, but in a fast-casual (or fast-food) setting. I've been a longtime fan of the ones in McCarthy Ranch in Milpitas and the one in Sunnyvale but this will likely be one of my new favorites.

I got some kind of beef schwarma salad, wasn't a huge fan of the dressing (very oily and limited flavor) but luckily I grabbed the garlic yogurt and cilantro mint sauces, so I poured those on instead. I'm looking forward to coming back and comparing the rest of the menu with the quality of the rest of the Dish Dash restaurant family.</text>< pictures>

Only ok. If you know a "real" Dish Dash in Sunnyvale or Milpitas you will prefer it 100% of the time. Food selection here is limited and preparation less careful. Hummus plate was good, rest below average. No reason to come back.</Text>

The food here is really great. If you're like me and naively expect this to be more of a fast food atmosphere due to the name, you're in for a treat when you find out the truth!<//text>

I eat here at least once every time I come to San Jose. Would eat here more if they were open on Sundays (they're not) or stayed open later (they close at 9). I usually get the wrap (I've tried em all, all good), although last time I got a salad, which was a *mountain* of food (and which I ate).<//text>

The food is great; we tried falafel wrap and mansaf. The wrap was great. The mansaf was delicious but not the original taste of mansaf if you’re looking for authentic. Still, not bad. Plenty of parking in the block. It’s a good place to take kids as well.< /text><name>Jansait Qughondouqa< /name><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Food is fresh and tasty, but portions are a bit small considering the price, so the value proposition needs a little work. Friendly staff.< /Text>

Good Chicken, Fish and Falafel dishes , classy ambience, variety of hoppy beers to choose from with a dash of sports channels on the TV. Their unique range of dips from mild to spicy is a delight. Treat to all your senses.<//text>

Dish n Dash is the fast food version of the famous Dish Dash restaurant. Food is fresh and flavorful, but can be a little overpriced for fast food.< /Text>

The food was on point and delicious,  the wait for food was very short and the service was very accommodating, they even let us stay quite a bit past closing without making us feel rushed (though you should try to make it out before closing, it was a bit rude of us to stay so long).<//Review>
