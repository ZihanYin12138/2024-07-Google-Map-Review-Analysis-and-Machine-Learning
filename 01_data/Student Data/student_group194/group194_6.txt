I have purchased a total of 2 trucks and 1 car from here.  Great selection of inventory and has financing terms for everyone.  Most of the negative reviews here seem to be from people who don't understand the law when it comes to vehicle purchasing and financing.  That being said, all of their vehicles come with a warranty and can be taken for inspections at the independent mechanic of your choice.< /text>

The fact that no one answers the phone is bad, but to make it worst not one employee is outside to help a buyer on the lot. 40 minutes I waited to have a younger guy come out finally who does the car detail usually , he greets me, and after another 30 minutes to find a key for 1 car to take out to test drive didn't make it to far as the car had no gas etc. It was aweful. This place doesn't care about  selling cars or customers at all. That is the impression I got.<//Text>

I’ve bought two cars from Integrity Motors. I’ve never had a problem with the cars or with the staff. They’ve never hassled me if I was late on a payment. I would definitely recommend them if you’re looking for a good car.

Don’t buy a car from here , they burned my brother !! And lie about the car , they say to bring it in so they can fix it and then it has another problem . He hasn’t even had the car for 30 days and they won’t give him another car or his money back . The car was driving perfectly fine when he first got it . And now it needs 3 motor mounts . There’s guys in and out of there looking like they are on drugs . I wouldn’t recommend there cars to anyone . Unless checked by a professional  first . I’m currently seeking a lawyer to fix the problem , because they didn’t wanna solve it the right way .</review>

If I could give zero stars I would. Bought a 2005 Mistubish eclipse from them. Would not start the day after I bought it. Called the dealership and was sent with "get it towed here and we can tell you what's wrong with it" for only 100 dollars. Paid the car off as fast as I could and they didn't even report it, so I'm still a "first time buyer" when getting a new car.</Review>

<Date>1520668522048<//Date><Text>This dealership is a joke I would not buy a car from them again. I bought a Blazer from them and when I test drove it it had a the check engine light on plus did not run that smoothly and they said it was because they had cleaned the engine. I told the salesman to gas it for me and to make sure everything was good on it and he said all the cars in lot are good to go. Turns out i drove off with no brake or any lights working at all it also needs motor mounts has a Miss fire and need a new exhaust pipe. Took it back 3 days later and said they would fixed it but they just did a oil changed on it and reset the engine light and still went with the story that the engine getting cleaned was the cause of the problem. Then they said they would fix it but I would have to pay for it. Bad experience I thought things had changed since 8 yrs ago when my uncle got hustled when just like me we where still under there 30 day warranty wich is a joke. after 25 days I had my truck problems became a nightmare. It sucks to make payments on a car that doesn't work properly.

Batteries are funny like that, they can go out for various reasons at times, from simple temperature fluctuations to just not being warmed up often enough. It happens from time to time. This is a common issue with motor vehicles in general.  Sir, we are not trying to pull one over on anyone, that's why there is a free Carfax sitting on the dash of our vehicles disclosing vehicle history. Just like people, all cars have a different history. We have sold many cars with various legal mods over the years to many happy customers in the know. We are full disclosure when it comes to vehicles we sell.  We even encourage you to check with your own mechanic as well if you have any doubts. All of our vehicles go through a meticulous 100+ point safety inspection before they get to the lot to be sold. We would love the opportunity to redeem ourselves, if you have any questions regarding cars or financing (even if its not regarding one of our cars) please reach out and allow us to be of service to you."}</Resp>

The cars online look better than the absolute garbage they have in the lot, no one around to even ask questions to, all cars locked so can't even browse, no wonder these guys have such a bad reputation,  dirty lot, damage to most cars, wouldn't feel safe buying from them at all.

This is the last place in the world I would ever buy a car again. I bought a truck there a year ago. The right rear wheel fell off! They "repaired" it with the cheapest parts they could find. The vehicle was unsafe. While arguing with them over fixing it, they reposessed it. Shady as the day is long. Don't buy here!</review>

You only just recently had issues recently and came to us with a price quote form a local mechanic. We offered to finance the cost of the repairs and do them for half the cost you were quoted. Considering your situation the interest rate was exceptional. We are still here for you if you need anything and will still give you best deal possible.'}< /resp>

<text>I would never buy a vehicle from this dealership again. When financing they lied about some details of the loan, tried to reposess my vehicle before the first payment was even due and the worst part was the vehicle was broken down in the shop with in the first 6 weeks I owned it. That was an additional $2000 repair bill the the dealer refused to help fix. They are poorly managed and sell unreliable vehicles.</text>< pics>

<Text>Take my word for it and go here for your dental needs!

I can put my word in for how professional Dr. Tsang was in taking care of my dental needs. Take a peek at the pictures below AND tell me that isn't amazing! Throughout my case, he was able to communicate my dental needs, costs, and operations in a professional manner, look for ways to save me money through insurance, and have patience for my tedious dental case. He is also very well-spoken, which I noticed off the first bat of meeting him. This was nothing like my last dentist!

Not to mention, his staff, from the front desk workers to the dental assistants, surgeons, and the lab staff in Pinole. Shoutout to y'all! I've had chances to interact with a lot of the staff and I can say, without a doubt, they are a culturally diverse group that really CARES about your dental needs.

For my dental case pictures on the bottom, I had a dental crown procedure done on my front four teeth. Now, I get compliments from my orthodontists, friends, coworkers, and family about how my teeth transformed and all I can do is thank myself for going to Dr. Tsang for my crown procedure, wisdom teeth removal, and teeth cleanings.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHfIm2c87E3oGR5D-hflu-a9pSGkluWlibhPYz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb-flG_083ZoHaB3Qy5I7RY96X7QcGxRpnhFcm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6V4PFMa4kWNwJ5TiopOa2gXIMr88RE_rz9PzU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80857702ed3587a3:0xc9ac1ea1273185ac< /gmapID></record>

<text>I had a wonderful experience! The front office staff were friendly,  courteous, and helpful. The appointment was timely with almost no wait time in the lobby or treatment room. Dr. Tsang took time to fully explain treatment options and address my questions and concerns. The hygienist was knowledgeable and efficient.  I had a wonderful new patient experience. Definitely a hidden gem in the Bay Area!<//text>< Pics>

This was my first visit to Dr. Tsang's office. I went with my friend, Ms. Claire J Baker, and the both of us were extremely impressed with everything about this practice!! It was so professional, so congenial, so comprehensive and modern. The ambiance and the staff were absolutely wonderful. I have plenty of experience with other dentists in my life and Dr. Tsang is tops. I would highly recommend him to all my friends!  Thank you for being right here in Pinole. We're very lucky to have you!</Review>

When I lost a crown off my molar, I was able to get an appt for the very next day - even as a new patient! The staff are very nice and welcoming. The cash price  very reasonable, the dentist and assistant friendly, efficient, easy-going and capable. Overall, a great atmosphere and experience.</Review>

Loved working with everyone at this office. They were all super nice and actually listened to my needs. I’m not too fond of dentist being that I have sensitive teeth/gums but they were gentle enough and had a plan to make me comfortable. I will definitely be an ongoing patient at Dr. Tsang’s office.< /Text>

This was my first visit to Dr. Tsang. The team is extremely professional, yet personable!  And, it was, by far,  the most thorough, and gentle, dental exam that I’ve ever received.  I highly recommend Dr. Tsang and his team to anyone looking for a pleasant, non-stressful, dental experience.< /review>

<Review>Dear dr. Tsang,
Thank you and your team for getting me in with such a short notice, and thank you for the referral to Dr. Bhullar. He performed a root canal on my tooth and I am feeling much better now.
Best regards,

<Text>Best dental experience I've ever had!
Ok first thing, nobody likes going to the dentist but it's absolutely necessary. I went to Dr. Tsang after experiencing a not so pleasing outcome with another dentist who told me I would need a root canal on a particular tooth, I decided it would be best and cheaper to just have it removed.

Dr. Tsang after examining it, saw no need for a root canal, so I scheduled an appointment with him to have the work performed.

I can't rave enough about my experience there. The office is very clean, the office staff were very polite, the dental assistants were proficient and courteous; professionalism all around.
Dr. Tsang was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions, (and I definitely asked alot), he worked on my tooth, and did an excellent job. Little to no pain and a quick recovery. I was chewing with that tooth the very next day.
Great experience all around, I highly recommend the dental office of Dr. Tsang!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I'm a newer patient of Dr. Tsang's practice, but I'm certain it's to become my "forever dental office." Everyone - from the office staff to the hygienists to Drs. Tsang and Chan themselves  - attends to their patients professionally and kindly. Wait time is minimal in my experience; routine exams and cleaning are performed thoroughly. Rosanna, one of the hygienists, makes time in The Chair tolerable. She has a good way of keeping me distracted from the work being done. And, I appreciate her tips on how to improve my oral routine. Overall,  a wonderful practice!< /Text>

< Review>
I've been to a few dentists around the area. Some of the things I really enjoyed about this place is that they let you fill out the paper work early. They're super quick to get you in the door and the room. I wasn't waiting. Another bonus was that the hygienist and the assistant were super nice, gentle and paying attention to detail. I didn't need to ask for the suction once. The x-rays are clear, and the extra color pictures show you what your teeth really look like. No confusion, no behind the scenes decision making. This place lets you know what's up and then does what you want.<//Review>

I had a great experience - My friend referred me to Dr. Tsang .   I cannot say enough! I got an appointment within  a few days!! The staff was very friendly, respectful and courteous. As I did not have my insurance information, they looked it up, explained  and gave me a copy of my coverage. X-rays were taken by the assistant with a high tech X-ray machine.  This was so much gentler than the huge antiquated xray machines . Dr. Tsang was very informative.  He addressed my tooth aches!! He cleaned my teeth! First he applied a numbing cream before he cleaned my teeth. He took several pictures of my teeth.  I purchased several items to help me with my teeth - a pressure water cleaner. I can’t wait to use !
I had a great experience !!! I’m so glad my friend recommended Dr. Tsang.   I will be going back in a few weeks - to continue my dental treatment.
I’m so happy with Dr. Tsang !!! And all the staff members !!! They are all great !!!</Text>

I found Dr Tsang through a Yelp visit.  He had 5-stars.  I’ve been with him for several years and I have not been disappointed.  The office is always clean, staff professional and polite.  My hygienist is thorough in cleanings.  Dr Tsang is really kind.  The dental areas are so relaxing.  After the pandemic broke out, their office is a safe place to go.  I’m very happy with my dentist and his staff.</review>

Dr. Tsang is simply the best. I broke my tooth yesterday and he was able to see me this morning. He had to get to work early to fit me in and he didn’t hesitate. He is a dentist who deeply cares about the well being of his patients.</Text>

This team is top notch! Three days before I was scheduled to move to San Diego, one of my crowns popped off my molar. The office made time for me and requested the lab to prioritize & expedite my new crown to be done within two days.

The experience in the chair was also one of the best I’ve ever had. And Ive spent a lot of time in dentist chairs. A lot.

Dr Tsang - thank you thank you thank you for fitting me in and taking care of my emergency.

I definitely recommend this dental office!!< /text>

Went in on a same day emergency call, and was just glad they could get me in to get looked at. Staff was super friendly and courteous from the moment I walked in.

My wife and I have been receiving dental services in Albert M. Tsang DDS office over the last year and a half. The office staff is friendly, efficient, and courteous. Their dental professionals are competent, knowledgeable, and personable. When I needed oral surgery, they referred me to a nearby reputable specialist who was a trusted colleague, he provided excellent care. I recommend Albert M. Tsang DDS dental services; they work hard to apply the standards of best practice. Their intent is to provide customers with the best dental care possible in all areas of dentistry.<//text>

Best dentist experience I have had, Covid-19 compliant and very safe and clean, great staff, very professional and accommodating to my schedule. They work with most insurances. Affordable. Best of all, they do an excellent job. My teeth were bad, crooked and kept on chipping before I went to Dr. Tsang, then he did 4 crowns done and Dr. Tsang and his staff did an excellent job. Now my teeth are nearly perfect thanks to Dr. Tsang and staff, and I have pictures to prove it. Now, all I have to do is come in for the normal cleanings routine every 6 months. Pictures are before and after. Thank you Dr. Tsang. 👍👍👍😊😊😊<//text>

The staff went out of their way to make sure I was seen, comfortable, and informed. They stayed late to help me which they didn't have to do and were all so nice and sympathetic to me when I was crying about the injuries that brought me to them. I will make them my real dentist for sure.<//Text>

I am from out of the area and needed emergency dentistry.   I had a difficult time finding a dentist to take me on short notice.   I was so pleased when Dr Tsang not only accommodated me but did a wonderful job explaining carefully exactly what needed to be done and what it would cost.  If I lived in the area he would be my dentist for sure!</Text>

<Text>Very happy patient.  From the moment I walked into this office to the friendly smiles of the staff I knew this was the right place for me.  The office came highly recommended and I can see why.  Super friendly staff, extremely knowledgeable and friendly dentist who is so very caring and works well with the staff.  Very professional, takes time to explain procedures and I truly get the feeling that they all care deeply for my needs.  Dental office and bathroom super clean.  And I love the latest tech equipment.  My experience is a breath of fresh air from my previous dental office of many years.  On my first visit I was quick to transfer over to Dr. Tsang after I saw how thorough, caring and knowledgeable he was.  I absolutely love the job he and his lab did on my caps and can't imagine having this type of quality done anywhere else.  So thankful to have found this gem of a place.  I've always dreaded visiting the dental office until now.  Many thanks Dr. Tsang and staff.  I look forward to many years of service with your office.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>One of my porcelain crowns cracked on me and my usual dentist wasn't taking patients due to the C.V.  So I had to find another dentist Asap. It was Friday afternoon Lucky for me I found Dr Tsang's office open for business,  the receptionist made me an appt. for that Monday. I spent about 10 minutes in the waiting room filling out the usual forms and then moved to a room where the dental assistant took some x-rays, shortly after Dr Tsang came in to examine my tooth and a new crown was ordered. 2 weeks later crown was installed and now I'm a happy camper again! Dr Tsang was very friendly and professional, his staff was also very friendly and attentive. I will be going back for another exam & cleaning.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I am a new patient of Dr Tsang. He came very well-recommended so I decided to give his practice a try. Right away I noticed his is a well-run office, with friendly assistants who know how to make patients feel comfortable. After my experience with various dentists, I can tell Dr Tsang is a friendly, professional dentist who will give you the information you need and put you at ease. I've had a consultation about a crown and I liked the way he explained the procedure to me. His rates are reasonable, and parking is easy in that area. His practice is worth checking out.< /text>

First visit with Dr. Tsang and staff. From my first phone call to Crystal explaining why I was looking for a new dentist, to the efficiency of new patients forms emailed (less direct contact during COVID-19), to discussions of wether or not I should get prior records to my first visit, I could not have felt more positive about being a person that was cared for and not a faceless number. Welcoming, professional and compassionate at every encounter. A day before my appointment I was emailed a Covid questionnaire, and my temperature was taken upon arrival. Staff wearing masks and face shields. A very efficient wearing masks and face shields. A very efficiency run practice. Crystal who answered the phone also did my x-rays, the doctor also took photos of my teeth, did a full examination, went over my hot spots with suggestions and treatment plans, and he did my cleaning. The dental assistant was in there assisting with water and suction while the doctor used the ultrasound to clean, picks for under the gums and polished. Quick, painless (always checked to see if I was comfortable and could raise my hand to indicate sensitivity) and professional. Dr. Tsang and I had a frank discussion about my gums and overall teeth health and I left with a plan, follow up visit and equipment to better care for my oral health. Your parting gift bag does not include a .50 generic toothbrush and floss, but a spin brush for better gum health, floss and toothpaste. He also suggested using an air floss which I purchased from him for less than Target prices (I checked).
Dr. Tsang and his office are true professionals who care for your health and treat you as a person and not a wallet. Their cash client discounts are significant and much better than my prior who only gave me 10% discount. I would highly recommend him to anyone.
Thank you Dr. Tsang, Crystal and staff!</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>From getting me in the same day I called with a broken molar, to getting the remnants removed, to their friendly and professional manner, I give them 5 stars. Getting a tooth pulled is nothing anyone looks forward to, but they made it as painless as possible. They checked in several times to assure I was numb enough, communicated clearly about the procedure and aftercare, and the end bill was exactly what I’d expected.  Thank you, Dr. Tsang and staff!</review>< pictures>

My first time here and let me say that it was a good experience! My wisdom tooth started hurting and I knew it had to be remove.. the whole process from appointment time to when I left was excellent! Dr.Tsang and his Staff are friendly and quick.. my procedure was done quick! I thought the next few days after the procedure I will be in pain but NOTHING! Its day 3 today and still no kind of pain!I'm so glad I went to Dr.Tsang!</review>

Dr.Tsang is a miracle doctor. Why did I say this? Because there's not a lot of doctor who will truly care about you. I've been so depress because my front tooth filling cracked after 15 + years that I had it. I went and see a doctor for this reason and she removed the old filling then put a new one but it chipped off 2x after few weeks, the 3rd time it chipped off, I am so scared to go back to her because she said there's possibility that I will need a crown if it happen again.My tooth never hurts so I know it can still be fix. I found Dr.Tsang and read his reviews..I am hoping that he can give me a better solution and HE DID! He understands how I feel. I want to save my front tooth if possible. Dr.Tsang is kind, knowledgeable and professional. He has a very good sense of humor as well. Him and his team are very very nice. I LOVE THEM ALL.

Today, Dr.Tsang fixed my front tooth. I was initially scheduled for my 2 back teeth filling only but I am really desperate to have my front fix so I asked Dr.Tsang and without hesitation..even with his busy schedule..He fixed it for FREE! My tooth now looks more natural and even. It feels good. I have never given a free service before so I was really shock but that's how good he is. HE CARE. He understands people needs.

I will be forever grateful to Dr.Tsang and his team. And I will never forget the kindness he showed to me today.

Dr.Tsang......you're a wonderful doctor.

I thank you for everything..

Dr. Tsang was super nice when I first met him; I felt he was a genuine person. I liked the fact that he was very informative! He explained my xrays and photos to me.  He laid out all options to resolve the issue I have with my dental heath  and he made a recommendation based on what he thinks would be best for me.  He explained them all thoroughly and then he communicated what needs to be done with his office manager, who is very friendly and knowledgeable on what she does.  The staff was great too.< /review>

<Review>We have been going to this dental office for several years now. Dr. Tsang took over from our previous dentist. We have been very happy with the transition. The staff are all caring professionals. Dr. Tsang is kind and is great with keeping my anxiety with dentists at bay. Our favorite dental hygienist is amazing. I'd rather not share her name, it's hard enough for us to book an appointment with her because she's that awesome!  😄 Katherine at the front desk is a pro in helping you understand your insurance bureaucracy. Thank you Dr. Tsang and staff for truly caring about your patients and our needs.</Review><user>103118430071282734987< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Have been coming to Dr. Tseng for around 3 years now. Everyone at the office is incredibly kind and patient. They remember who you are and take the time to see how you are doing. This is a guilt-trip free office that won't make you feel bad about your teeth or frequency of your flossing while at the same time giving information on how to improve your mouth care.

The cleanings are thorough and efficient and I have been very happy with the quality of a couple cracked fillings they fixed/ replaced. I wouldn't consider going anywhere else</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Dr. Tsang and his team are the greatest! This has been the smoothest dental visit I've ever had. I didn't feel a thing and it went by so fast. He even kept me posted by showing me pictures of all that I had going on in my mouth.
Thank you Dr. Tsang and shout out to Catherine for being dope too!</text>

A Friday, holiday weekend, and I am having severe mouth pain, they were kind enough to fit me in.  From the initial call until I walked out the door, despite the loss of 3 teeth, the team was excellent, warm, caring and most of all kind and gentle. Best dental experience ever.  I highly recommend them and I'm calling here for future appointments.<//text>

After visiting many clinics I’ve finally found a dentist!! I highly recommend Dr. Tsang and his very friendly staff. My visits here have been consistently awesome and that’s something that is important to me. Dr. Tsang really helps explain x-rays very well in a way that I understand and nothing like my previous dentist who just mentioned the amount of cavities I needed filled.  Every time I have been here I have received great dental care and have received soo much help from front desk staff in verifying my dental coverage that seemed almost impossible to get a hold of in previous offices. I highly recommend Dr. Tsang and his staff!!< /review>

Dr.Tsang is a very skillful doctor although he does not talk too much!!  I did 2 gold crowns by Dr.Tsang!  Going back to Dr.Tsang for my 3rd crown!  No pain for the injection and even drilling !  I don’t need to be a professional dentist to feel how well Dr.Tsang did my tooth!  I can feel his great work and care for his patients!  Highly recommended !

Today I have my permanent gold crown that I feel so good and happy after done by Dr. Tsang and Karen!  Dr. Tsang even did the cleaning for me!  No pain at all and I got Dr. Tsang’s complement that I’ve got Mercedes teeth that means I have a clean bill of teeth!!  Dr. Tsang offered to adjust my night guard!!  What a great service of my appointment with Dr. Tsang!  Great dental work and great service that’s made my day!!  Highly recommend!</Text>

I’ve been going here for 3 years now because the staff and service is great. Every single time I go to get a procedure done I leave satisfied and happy because they do a quick and perfect job. The office is spotless. They always recommend something that might be helpful for my teeth whenever I have a problem and they always follow up with calls after my appointments to see how I am doing. They are very attentive and take good care of me.</review>

<review>Dr. Tsang and his staff are very accommodating as usual. I had a dental emergency today and they fit me right in.  They are a very friendly, experienced, and cohesive team, working to ensure each patient is comfortable, well cared for, and happy with the results when you leave their office. I have entrusted my dental care to this team for many years. Give them a try, you'll be happy you did.<//review><UserId.>101808518732625348921</UserId.><time>1568427743957</time><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

I been going to this office for many years. The staff is amazing and very friendly. I make family appt. Which allows my 2 kids to be able to go with me for a check up. My kids 3 and 7 love visiting the dentist they are not even afraid. If anything they are excited and know that they can get a little treat at the end of the visit. Thank you Albert Tsang DSS for making my kids so comfortable and happy when they visit you.<//Review>

I have been coming here for a while as my family has been coming here as well.

The staff is always friendly and very professional.

Dr. Chen was amazing and had such a gentle hand when cleaning my teeth.

I will keep driving a ways just to come to this office!

Highly recommend this place if your looking for a friendly, clean, and efficient dental office in the east bay!<//Review>

Absolute great staff and doctor Tsang has always been very clear about what to expect ( I have only implants by now). My dental history is very long, painful, and frustrating but wit Dr. Tsang and his crew I always feel heard and  well taken care every single time I have to see them. They are really really great . I’m very grateful. If you decide to visit them, you will be very happy.< /text>

I had an unfortunate accident over the weekend when I tripped and fell flat on my face chipping a tooth along with 8 stitches in my lower lip. Despite the embarrassing circumstances I called my dental office to make and appointment.

They told me to come right in to be seen by Dr. Tsang. They were compassionate and professional. Dr. Tsang shared personal stories of similar experiences and made me feel comfortable. He gave me the option to have the work done right away on my still sore mouth or to put a temporary patch on it. I choose the patch.

The office staff was competent and polite they scheduled my follow-up appointment and provided a copy of the plan including my cost.

Overall they made a difficult situation Pleasent.

I highly recommend Dr. Tsang<//text>

<text>I have been attending this clinic at least for more than 15 years and I have always being treated with great respect, professionalism, and understanding.  Dr. Tsang is such a nice human being. Always smiling, patient, and solving my teeth problems which are more than abundant. I have the worst teeth in the world history and Dr. Tsang has always  explained even the little details to give me the peace of mind for the next treatment.  If you go there you will be highly satisfied. And Mrs. Elsa, the secretary,  she is just  the best. You'll see.<//text><Name>Nadia Soto</Name>< user>

<review>Dr. Tsang, with all of his professional staff and excellent office personnel, make the experience of going to the dentist less stressful than it could be. Everyone is calm, helpful, and very knowledgeable in their areas of expertise. Going to a dentist doesn't have to be a traumatic experience, and Dr. Tsang demonstrates that every time I visit.

He is willing to work with you on finding an appropriate solution to your dental needs, one that suits your schedule, your pain tolerance, as well as your budget. He will explain to you any procedure he recommends so that you can mentally prepare yourself before a procedure if you need.

Elsa, the office manager, helps Dr. Tsang by running a "tight ship," and sending appointment reminders in a timely manner.

So, in more ways than the most obvious one that a dental office can give, your experience in this dental office will always keep you smiling. You will be delighted to have the "team" service you, and know you are receiving the best dental care possible. Make an appointment today, and get all of your teeth into the best possible shape they can be.</review><rate>5< /rate><pics>None</pics><Time>1441564935841</Time></record>

<Text>I first saw Dr. Tsang after I was experiencing a bothersome toothache.  He took great care of me and I have been a regular patient ever since. The entire staff is excellent. Elsa always makes sure you get an appointment at a convenient date and time. Dr. Tsang and the hygienist always provide helpful recommendations that show great results. The office location is very convenient, even for someone who comes from outside the area like myself. I do not know if you can find a dental office that is more friendly and comfortable. Highly recommend!<//Text>< pics>

Dr. Tsang made me feel right at home, and I had great service. He took the time to show me all my photos and X rays and go over everything super clearly. I also never had a dentist hand me a mirror and really demonstrate how I should be caring for my teeth.

Also, I had an issue with my insurance, and Dr. Tsang’s office ended up taking care of the cost for me! Excellent people and superb service.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80857702ed3587a3:0xc9ac1ea1273185ac<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

So happy with my new dentist Dr. Tsang! I had a pain free and very informative first appointment. From the moment I walked in The office I was welcomed by Elsa the lady in the front desk, who was very sweet and helpful. She explained the offers they provide for patients like myself with no insurance and answered all my questions.

The assistants and hygienist are very kind and make you feel right at home. I am someone who is very nervous and I hate the clicking and sounds the instruments make. I was very excited I was offered to listen to music of my liking to help me relax through my cleaning. Really happy with this office and I will highly recommend this office to friends and family.<//Text>

During one holiday week end, my wife accidentally bite on something hard and her big tooth cracked. Called her Dentist and no response. My wife was in excruciating pain at late Saturday night.  Kept calling every dentist in the phone book. No one answered. Unluckily when I call Dr Tsang, he answered and took care of my wife at the soonest manner. Dr Tsang is a professional dentist. He is very experience, always open and honest to me with options and solution for my dental problem. Besides a professional dentist, he is also a friend!</review>

Everyone in the office is wonderful. The staff is so caring. Dr Tsang takes care of his patients and that means a lot. Called to make an appointment for a tooth ache and the office told me to come right on over. They were very attentive to my needs and scheduled my appointment with the referring dr within minutes.< /Text>

My whole family has been going to this practice for years (for me since I was a young child). I first had the pleasure of having Dr. Au as my dentist (he was fantastic) but upon his retirement Dr. Tsang took over his practice and I cannot not be happier that I stayed.  Dr. Tsang is a wonderful dentist and his all his staff are like family. They always greet me with a smile and ask about my family and work.  Dr. Tsang and his staff take great care of their patients and I am lucky to have him as my dentist. They truly make the whole experience of going to the dentist a breeze. I would highly recommend Dr. Tsang to anyone looking for a great dentist. They provide such good care that I tell people I love going to my dentist all the time!<//Text>

<Text>I have been going to this office for many years now. I was very excited when I heard that Albert M Tsang was going to be taking over the office. He is a very respectful and kind to all of his patients.. He does his best to make all his patients, including my whole family and I, feel very comfortable with the way he does all of our dental work. I have never had a complaint about anything that he's done. The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting. The staff is incredibly friendly and just as kind as Dr. Tsang. They are all very easy to talk to and to schedule appointments. I would recommend them to everyone I know.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I was having a tooth problem and could not get in touch with my regular dentist. I called Dr. Tsang’s office and they scheduled me within 45 minutes of my call and got my insurance information over the phone to help speed the process along. I was very impressed with the office right away. It is beautifully decorated. The front desk staff is very welcoming and helpful. They got me right back into an exam room and did their work quickly and very efficiently. I was referred to a specialist and the staff took care of scheduling that appointment for me with no hesitation. My husband and I are thinking of switching dentists for our family to Dr. Tsangs practice. You truly can not beat honest, caring, professional and helpful these days. I would 100% recommend Dr. Tsang for any tooth problems. Thank you Dr. Tsang.<//Text>

Very professional highly skilled dental care.
I had a botched crown replaced here and they took the time to explain every detail and made sure it's done right this time.
Definitely recommend the practice, both doctors are great!</Text>

<Text>So happy I started coming to this new dentist! Dr. Tsang is amazing and so are all the staff. Elsa, the lady at the front desk has been extremely prompt and helpful with my appointments as well. Walking into this office is very warm and welcoming! I got the best cleaning with no pain, and each procedure I’ve had done has been amazing. I would refer every one of my friends to come here! I’m really nervous about loud noises from the dental equipment, so they gave me headphones to listen to music during my cleaning which I thought was very sweet too!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Dr. Tsang has provided my family with excellent dental care since he took over this practice in 2009. He is a wonderful person and a great dentist.  My husband and I have had quite a lot of work done by him including root canals, crowns, extractions, fillings, and recently an implant. My experience has always been positive. He is trained in the latest technology. He makes you feel comfortable, provides reassurance, and provides information on how to improve your oral health. The office staff is efficient, friendly, professional and always so pleasant. I will definitely continue referring my friends here!< /text>< pics>

<review>My first experience at Dr. Tsang was eye opening. Could I have finally found a Dentist who could do a crown in a way that felt not just tolerable but actually comfortable? I have being coming to see them ever since and my check ups are not just comfortable but actually pleasant. I get to listen to music of my choice and not the drill. He is gentle and responsive to the patient in every small way.  He has high expectations for himself and his staff in terms of quality from the receptionist to the assistants and hygienist. Elsa is like family and takes time to make you feel welcomed. The proof is having had better and better dental health since I started seeing him. And now giving that gift to my children who think a visit to the dentist is actually fun as they leave with a balloon in hand.< /review>< pics>

<text>Our whole family has been going here for years. When Dr. Au retired, on his recommendation, we remained with the new dentist, Dr. Tsang. He's a good dentist and is carrying on in the fine, professional tradition established over many years by Dr. Au. I would recommend him to anyone with confidence. My experiences there have always been pleasant. The whole crew are like extended family. My children have gone to this dental office throughout their entire childhoods into adulthood. Elsa, the receptionist has always been thoughtful and kind and greets everyone with a huge smile. BTW: In early childhood I was hurt badly by a dentist. In my late teens started going to this office and lost all fear. I've never, ever experienced pain here. These folks are great! I hope you will consider this dental group for all of your family's needs.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80857702ed3587a3:0xc9ac1ea1273185ac<//Gmap_id><UserId.>106377679895042729395< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>I used to go to a different dentist near by but I didn't like it to much. It's been a while since I went to the dentist I thought about giving a new dentist a try so, I searched on yelp for good dentists in my area. I made an appointment and came here and loved it. They're very friendly and a comfortable environment. Small staff so they know you after the 2nd or 3rd visit. I'm so glad I switched over to them and will continue to do so. Thank you so much!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have been going to this office since I was a child and can truly agree with all the previous comments about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff is here.  Dr. Tsang took over the practice a few years ago and to be honest I was a bit intimidated when going to my first appointment with him as I knew it would be a new experience. However, from the moment I met him, I felt at ease.  He has a very calm and assuring demeanor. I like the fact that he explains the procedures clearly and takes his time making sure I understand them. Not many people look forward to going to the dentist but him and his staff make every visit, a pleasant experience. As long as I stay in the bay area, even if I moved a bit further, I would still continue coming here, I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Tsang and his staff.<//text>< Pictures>

I was looking for a new dentist a couple of years ago and found Dr. Tsang on Yelp.  He got good reviews so I decided to make an appointment for myself and my 2 kids, now age 8 and 10.  The office was very clean and everyone there is great! The kids especially liked it there and they enjoyed the TV screen in the exam rooms. I would definitely recommend Dr. Tsang and his staff!</Text>

< Review>
Dr Tsang is an awesome dentist. Not only did he examed my teeth carefully, but introduce me the right tools to work with in my daily cleanings.

He is the only dentist that I saw in past couple years who actually found out the root cause of my sore tooth, before it's too late . Thanks a lot Dr Tsang !

I highly recommend him !< /Review>

Finding a good dentist is not only tricky but stressful; we as family of 4 are very happy and delighted to have found Dr. Tsang.
We’ve had bad experiences with other dentists including pediatric dentists. It was a blessing to find people that really care and understood what our needs were, got great advice. Not long after I also had my kids seen here. They feel comfortable, safe and the staff is so friendly and caring, they like to go to the dentist now! And they get to pick prizes every time they are seen. They love it!
I would really recommend Dr. Tsang as your dentist, not only to my friends and family but everyone out there trying to find a great dentist!!<//review>

I highly recommend Dr. Tsang as your choice of dentist. I've been going there about 10 years now and dont plan on changing my dentist. They all make me feel right at home Every time I go. If you have not chose a dentist yet, stop looking and stop in and see Dr.Tsang....You wont be disappointed..<//review>

I was brought to this place on a groupon deal for Zoom Whitening and ended up switching dentists. Dr. Tsang is very knowledgeable and great at his work. All my experiences here have been very pleasant and comfortable.  I would highly recommend Dr. Tsang to friends and family. He has definitely made me more confident in my smile.</text>

<Text>I started feeling pain in the area where my molars were, so I knew it was time to get these bad boys out. Dr. Tsang was very professional, and did a fantastic job operating on my wisdoms.The process went smooth, couldn’t be more happier with my results. Best of all, they called me back to check up how I was doing the next day.</Text>< user_name>

I was referred to Dr. Tsang by my brother who has been going to him for a while now.  I have been hopping from dentist to dentist trying to find a place that I liked and I've finally found it.  I've always dreaded going to the dentist, especially a new one, but Dr.Tsang and his staff are awesome. They made me feel comfortable and at ease and continue to do so every time I have an appointment.  They also let me listen to music of my choice as they work on my teeth, which to me is the best thing ever!  As everyone knows, dental procedures are not cheap, but Elsa was able to work out a payment plan that would allow me to get my work done without having to put it off until it got any worse. I would definitely recommend Dr. Tsang's office to anyone looking for a new dentist.</Text>

<text>I hate seeing a dentist. Just the sound of drills haunts me till this day. Ive been in search of a new dentist since my old one moved away. So I made an appointment with Dr. Tsangs office. I spoke to Elsa. She is a really nice and helpful lady. That's probably one of the nicest and most helpful ladies in a dentist office. EVER! So there I am sitting on the dentist chair, and they take x-rays and then photos with a regular digital camera. So I was able to see my x-rays and my teeth in color full HD! The Dentist is a young man. He was a nice guy and down to earth.His assistant was really nice as well. sitting on that chair in the dentists office was pleasant. I felt as if i was talking to a friend rather then man who just wanted to dig into my teeth. Overall I really enjoyed my visit, even though no one likes the dentist, his place makes you feel at home.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Dr. Tsang and his staff were great. I never had good experiences in the past with dentists. I was in a lot of pain and kept putting it off. When I called Dr. Tsang's office Elsa in the front office was very helpful and tried to fit me in as soon as possible. He went over the whole procedure and let me know exactly what to expect. I recommend Dr. Tsang to my family and friends.< /text>< Rating>

<review>I'm very pleased with Albert Tsang DDS, he makes you feel very comfortable. Last year on Father's Day I had a crown come off from a previous dentist. I called him on Father's Day & he said just come in I'll fit you in first thing in the morning. He went in earlier & the secretary didn't even know that he was there to work on my crown. That's the great care he gives to his patients. He's also young so I know he has more knowledge in the latest technology of dentistry. My parents who are elderly loves him & that said a lot to his character for treating the elderly's with special care.</review><pictures>None</pictures><username>Lucille Ojeda< /username></record></dataset><record>

I chipped my tooth and Dr. Tsang did a great job patching it back together.  I got to my appointment a little early and they even slipped me in to get my teeth cleaned before the filling!  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Thanks!</Text>

I came with my brother for an appointment and had a great experience, my brother was in pain and was accommodated in the schedule and helped my brother with his dental problem. My brother and I are very thankful we were able to get awesome service even though we didn’t have an appointment, Dr.Tsang was very kind for taking my brother in.< /Text>

I got to know this place through my brother and sister in law as they both come here to get their teeth check.. so I decided to give it a try and made appt.. first time coming in, I was nervous but the employees here r so friendly and welcoming and I actually felt comfortable. So I met with  Dr. Tsang, he is super nice n friendly as well.. It was suppose to be just consult only on that day but I asked if I can just get couple of my fillings to be done today and he said yes and got my one side of teeth done on that same appt.. thankgod that he did it so that saved me from making another appt.. this place is so cozy and such a friendly employees.. I love it.. 👍👍👍👍< /review>

I recently took my 6 year old son to Dr. Tsang. My son had an amazing experience and was so happy with all of the kid related items Dr. Tsang had to make him feel comfortable. They even played Finding Nemo in the dentistry room. I had come to Dr. Tsang because the denist we had been at before gave me the feeling they were only trying to get money out of us and stated that my son had 3 cavities. I needed a second opinion and dr. Tsang was more than happy to help us out. turns out no cavities! We are now forever clients of Dr. Tsang and our little one can't wait for his next appointment. Thank you so much to the wonderful staff and of course Dr. Tsang. He showed compassion and was very gentle and explained everything he was going to do before hand. I feel more than safe with this office and recommend him to anyone looking for an amazing dentist!< /text>

Today: 10/20/2020
My family and I went in for our cleaning and I was a little hesitant due to the current pandemic. However, when I saw all of the staff wearing PPE, plexiglass installed at the reception area, hand sanitizers and air purifiers everywhere, my anxiety was instantly put at ease. They really went above and beyond to ensure the safety of their staff and patients. They consistently execute quality work and are always courteous and friendly! Dr. Tsang and his team have adapted to our "new normal" seamlessly.

6 years ago:
Dr. Tsang, Catherine, Elsa, and Michelle are awesome! I recently had a crown put in and you cannot even tell I had work done! I was very hesitant and worried about how it would look, but Dr. Tsang's talent made my crown look very natural! I also needed my permanent crown rushed due to 2 baby showers I had to attend and they had it ready for me in 1 week instead of 2 weeks! They rock!!! I also wanted to give a shoutout to the lady in the lab that did a great job on the color matching! Dr. Tsang and his "A" Team are the best!!! Quality work with excellent customer service!< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I have been visiting Dr. Tsang for over 10 years and have always received very good service. Your friendly and attentive staff. What I like the most is the personalized attention and there is always someone who speaks Spanish. I am very satisfied

<text>Decent All-you-can-eat with 2 pricing options. Again as a beef tongue lover I would say the beef tongue quality is satisfying. Pork jaw also is a new nice surprise to me. The free soup and side dish kimchi are both tasty - Will consider coming back again!<//text><name>Yoki Wang< /name>< gmap_id>

The owner came by our table to make sure everything was alright. Everyone at the restaurant was very hospitable. They even offered every table watermelon and ginger-cinnamon tea after dinner!!

We usually get so bloated after eating Kbbq, however, this time we weren’t bloated at all. Also, the side dishes and soup were delicious! Each one of us had our own plate full of side dishes.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>Really great little gem, bibimbap and the beef soup were good but we have to talk about what they do with potatoes. The potato pancake were awesome -- almost a creamy cheesy texture and super savory, and the potato salad side dish. Look, I normally hate potato salad but this is basically a dessert. Nothing but good things to say here.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x80c2c766a10b53af:0xb774444dd5fbaa2< /Gmap_id>< time>

This was one of the kbbq's i been to, the service was great and attentive,  always there. The star as always is the meat and when i tell you that the meat will send you to top, it was tender and full of flavor. If you're near ktown give this place a try you wont be disappointed.< /Text>

I’m so glad we were driving by & decided to stop by the best all you can eat Korean bbq, Super attentive staff & amazing owners!! They made us feel like home when we drove in at 10pm literally right before they closed & they took us in with no hesitation! No one was in the restaurant anymore, they didn’t rush us and gave us amazing service. They even sat with us while eating and held my puppy for me while I ate hahaha I had my 2 month old pug in my sweater.. Simply the best. MUST try!</review>< user>

On 04/03/2021 at 12:00 PM my family and I came here to eat some Korean cold noodles "mul naengmyeon" and L.A. galbi BBQ. We waited an hour to be seated. Once we got our table outside, the waitress told us they couldn't serve naengmyeon because it's "too busy." Then she told us we can order BBQ only at that time. After listening to her nonsense, my family and I left without ordering. I called the restaurant on 04/02/2021 and spoke to the male owner, he said that the restaurant served naengmyeon and L.A. galbi BBQ for $24.99. After confirming that, I told him I will come in tomorrow. I show up with my family and the waitress says they couldn't serve naengmyeon because it's too busy? What a joke! It was our first time here and our last time here.Thanks for ruining our day and for wasting our time. They just wanted to sell BBQ only to hustle my wallet, GREEDY. Don't try to outsmart your customers. Learn some customer service, seriously.</Text>

<text>Great place for Korean BBQ during these unique times. They’ve set out tables outside in the parking lot and each table has their own grill. Lisa was very accommodating and attentive. We had the prime cuts of meat and they were delish! We did not have the all you can eat so can’t comment on that. Their menu was a bit confusing so ask Lisa or your server to explain. Will definitely come back.< /text></record>

My wife and I were craving Korean bbq. We found this great place on google that have outdoor dining during this COVID restriction. Food was great and we felt the service was even better. The owner came out to personally talk to us and ask how things were. We will be coming back.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) All you can eat for $37.
We are the only Koreans.
Why are we the only Koreans in the Korean BBQ restaurant?
I tried it and got it.

Oh my goodness!!! Coming back from the Ag show and we were thirsty for a beer and googled this place.  So glad we did!!!!! I ended up ordering the ground beef tacos and they were to die for.  I never order tacos out because my mom always made the best and no one compared so why risk it.  Well these ranked right up there with them.  The salsa was the perfect amount of spicy but it didn't linger and great flavor.  The gal who served us was adorable and I believe she did the cooking also.  I can't wait to go back.

I like going in and look at all of different bottles of booze. They have a very good selection of different types of alcohol. Some are difficult to find and the price are very reasonable.</text>

This really is Family!! I have the privilege of knowing Ali and his wife for 24 years, they have never made me feel less than Family and for that I Thank them. The Atmosphere is Family, no pressure, no following you around looking for a Thief!! Plus... they have a little bit of Everything, I'm sometimes surprised when I find something I really need.<//text>

Great selection of craft beers. They sell cans by the singles. You'll find breweries such as Moonraker, Decadent Ales, Revision, Russian River, Arrow Lodge, etc.</Text>

<text>Rozzi's has everything such as i drinks, snacks, Chip's, little bit of everything. Including Sports items. Do you need a lighter they have all kinds. Do you want a slushie there you go they have it, ice cream, assortment of energy drinks and coffees, and yes they have the Man's drink in different assortment.
Yes they have gas but it's Chevron price they also take payments for gas and lights utility bills. Yes they make money orders and they have stamps as well. Since I write off from Lovers Lane, Visalia California.
Everyone that works there is very very kind to the owner in his employees I'm very helpful Cordele and they care about customer service spot on ,  they greet you every time you come in their establishment , and when you leave. Imma post a picture later on of this establishment.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I was on my way home from work today, on Lover's Lane, headed toward Rozi's, and I thought "It sure would be nice to pick up a bomber to go with dinner tonight. Maybe I should give Rozi's another chance."  But then I realized how frustrated I was 13 months ago when I got up to the register and found out that the bomber I had picked was $15.  I really like the selection of craft beers.  I just wish they would price them in the cooler!< /Text>

Things to keep in mind - they will only seat you once the entire party is there (the host asks to see everyone before they seat you). And the couches inside aren’t very comfortable.</text></record></dataset><record>

Overall: ✦✦✦.8

This sushi restaurant is definitely a hidden gem in Venice; people should at least give it a try once. Ambience is on point and perfect for a cute little date with your friends or significant other. In terms of tasting, I thought their sushi was just okay but I do highly recommend their crispy rice. Its crunchiness and savoriness definitely hit my spot. Otherwise, the presentation of dishes is work of art. Price is reasonable ($30-$50 per person).

It's a good starter for fancy sushi restaurant.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFhcC4dTsi6_fm7e2fzBSaYicDQmLFJsHoF9nS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

A unique place with good quality food. We had the asparagus which was amazing, the moon which is a yellow tail roll and it is pretty good, bluefin spicy tuna which as you can imagine has a great tuna and finally fish taco which was a big disappointment. The service was super slow but then again I guess the idea is to sit and take your time. This place is not gonna be on my return list but it was definitely worth the first visit<//text>

<review>My first time in LA and decided to give this place a try. Because of COVID-19 it’s to-go or delivery orders only. The packaging alone gets 10 stars!!! Originally I ordered through grub hub, but the order never processed so I drove to the location instead. Needless to say the staff is amazing they gave me a free fresh baked cookie just for choosing pickup.<//review>< pictures>

My recommendations:
Spicy marg
Crispy tuna 2.0 (below)
Brussel sprouts (MUST!)

I was wrong.
At first glance it seems like an overpriced sushi restaurant but let me tell you. This place has never once disappointed me. The ambience and food is amazing. I prefer their sushi to some of the dishes, which are always beautifully presented and taste fresh.

Today, I ordered takeout and not only was it the same restaurant quality but the PACKAGING was an experience. I will be supporting this restaurant and recommending to my friends during this time of closure.</text>

The host was adorable and kind and we got seated promptly.  We came for my birthday, and everything our waitress (Abby?) recommended was amazing. I can't remember the names of any of the rolls we got besides the Moon roll and the Lion King, but they all tasted complex, fresh and flavorful. The cookies are to die for, and our waitress even surprised me with a candle and a round of shots! Make sure to make reservations well in advance...its packed in the evening, understandably so! With that said, the place is COVID safe - all the staff was wearing masks and face guards, and there are barriers in between tables on the sidewalk. Would love to be able to sit on the inside patio next time. Overall, tasty food, lovely ambiance, and attentive and kind staff  Love you Wabi. Will be back.</Text>< rate>

<Text>Sufficiently mediocre.  Nothing blew me away or was a dish that made me say "I need to come back for this."
While the service was excellent, and the staff was very friendly, the food just wasn't as good as one had hoped.
We tried the short rib tacos, steak bao, chicken kaarge, crispy rice, brussel sprouts, seaweed salad, sushi plate, the moon, mr. Axel rose, rick james, spider roll, and the sushi roll with the gold on it. So we clearly tried a large portion of their menu...
What I think I realized is that they tried to take classic sushi rolls and then added one over powering or polarizing flavor that consequently made that roll taste very odd.
If I was forced to go back I would suggest multiple orders of crispy rice and brussel sprouts, but I guess that's just me.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I couldn't believe that this was the old wabi sabi where I worked many moons ago before a fire destroyed this precious place on Abbot Kinney. Well much to my surprise they're resurrected and thriving. Lunch specials are diverse and can feed anyone's palate. Tasty tofu bao, but a little more cucumber salad would give it extra needed crunch and flavor. The lychee rose was nice, a bit on the mild side, but definitely coming back to get a taste of the coco frozo which they weren't serving. Miso soup was exceptionally flavorful. Service was great and friendly, and the tunes were old school and had everyone nodding their head a bit. Many thanks to Brent for his friendly and welcoming hospitality. We'll be back.<//Text><date>1599698859423< /date><user_id>115414385163034612769<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am obsessed! Okay so I was driving around Venice and saw this restaurant from my car and immediately had to look up what it was/what it was called because it looked like a magical fairy garden. The vibes are on point!!! Seriously whoever designed this place knows what they are doing. I made a reservation to come with my boyfriend on a Thursday (during covid times). Luckily we made a reservation because there was over an hour wait for people who were doing standby. Our table was ready when we arrived and we were seated immediately. Again, the vibes were SO fun! Closest thing I have gotten to the club in a while. The bar is inside and they were bumping music similar to other sushi restaurants in LA. All of the waiters were wearing both masks and shields and were very attentive.

First, the drinks. Okay, if you are coming here you MUST try their drinks. They are so intricate, unique, beautiful, and DELICIOUS.
- Lychee on Rose Cocktail: Grey Goose, lemon, pomegranate, lychee, elderflower, citrus. This was 1 beautiful and 2 soo tasty. It was light, but also so flavorful.
- She So Sour: Japanese whiskey, lemon, lime, honey, passionfruit, egg whites, 24K gold!!! Like what?? Gold flakes on top!!! This was amazing. Definitely will be getting this the next time we come back.
- Yuzu O'Fashioned: delicious, classic old fashioned with Troy Boy's secret recipe.
- The Upper West Side: very good also!
- Sake: Snow Maiden Nigori

Second, the food. Ughhh such amazing food. Sushi is my favorite and this place definitely made the cut. This is what we ordered:
- Chili garlic edamame: edamame is always a must! The chili garlic flavor added a delicious kick.
- Crispy Rice: my absolute favorite meal. This was prepared perfectly and in the perfect portion size.
- Foxxy roll: This was recommended to use by the waiter and it was so incredible. It was a combination of several different fish, so it was also very filling.
- Shrimp Tempura roll: classic and flavorful. I can never go wrong with a shrimp tempura roll. Pair with wasabi and it's delicious.
- Tiger King is the absolute best roll on the menu! You must try. I have ordered it several times and each time it's amazing.
- Rick James is my second favorite. I highly recommend trying it if you like halibut, spicy tuna and yellowtail.
- I don't recommend the Baked Crab Roll. It is very bland and disappointing.

Dessert:
- Orange Ricotta Doughnut Holes: the donuts were very good and satisfying. Although, the dips (strawberry & apple) weren't very good.

I cannot wait to be back for more amazing vibes, drinks, and food :)</Text>< username>

<review>I had a great experience at Wabi. There is plenty of outdoor dining area, and the service was fantastic. The food was very good, but definitely not cheap (unless you are going to stick with their brunch menu). The sushi options have a high price, but the quality is very good (much better than their old location on Abbott Kinney).

As we were seated and waiting for friends to arrive, the manager/owner came by our table to tell us that he had just baked some amazing chocolate chip cookies, and asked if we’d like some. How could we say no?! We saved them for after our meal, and they were incredible, even topped with gold flakes.

There is an old expression that people don’t remember what you say, they remember how you made them feel. And Wabi on Rose made us feel like VIP customers!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

Excellent handrolls and the service is fantastic. We had the five and the six sets. We also ordered carry out which are regular sushi rolls. All of it was tasty and yummy. Our favorites were the scallop, crab and lobster. We totally messed up our order thinking we could bring some back to the hotel for our parents but they helped us fix it which was nice. They serve you one hand roll at a time so the seaweed doesn't get soggy. The wait is long but definitely worth it.</text>

<Review>I like this place. I'm sure I'm going to come back and try more things, which may change my review and add another star. But I wouldn't say it is as good as Neighbor yet. I had the tiger roll, which tasted like pretty much any roll you would get at any sushi place. The shrimp dumpling appetizers were very good.. the Lobster special was excellent.. and the artisan cocktails were strong - to medicinal tasting. And I tried three of them.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< username>

Absolutely one of THE most outstanding meals I have EVER had from start to finish and including an incredibly warm and welcoming staff.  Can I give it 8 stars?  How about 10?  : )< /text>

Although the setting was ideal, the experience we had at this restaurant was atrocious. We were sat at 4:45, given strict instructions of a 90 minute seating limit and promptly forgotten about for 23 of those minutes. Within that time, both my partner and I approached the host stand requesting service to order. When our server finally deemed it appropriate to show up, her attitude was rude and dismissive throughout the entire meal. Her “subtle” upsell from a $12 appetizer to a $37 main was ridiculous, especially given we’d already said we were there for drinks and snacks only. As someone who’s been in the hospitality industry for over a decade, I was appalled. Who knows what was going on in her day but it was extremely unprofessional start to finish.<//review>

<review>Sadly a disappointing experience. Don't get me wrong if I was rating on the food alone I'd give this place 5 stars no doubt!!! However, I made my reservation about 1 month and 1 week in advance and specifically added that it was my birthday and we were celebrating. When we got there (15 minutes early) we had no table at all. The hostess was being impatient and off putting and we ended up waiting 30-35ish minutes for our table that was WAYY too small for the number of guests to where we had to transfer multiple rolls to one plate or hold up plates to eat. After all of that the hostess nor our server never even wished me or acknowledged it was my birthday... great food but the most disappointing dining expire I've had in California for the price range.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Food was great, we came at 9pm and were seated right away at the sushi bar. The place is very small and very busy and lively. Food is a bit overpriced, we paid $50 for 3 sushi rolls and one miso soup. Friendly and attentive staff.</review>

They can’t be bothered to actually put the contents of their food on the menu. I was excited to see their California roll didn’t have crab in it. Ended up with half our order full of crab which I’m allergic to. Thanks wabi< /Review>

I was not prepared for such an avant-garde and hippie interior design and it made one somewhat, if not too uneasy to dine with nightclub music. Foodwise it was okayish (set the price aside). The sashimi was fresh and the seaweed salad was tasty. But I would not recommend the PB&J roll - the sous vide pork belly was dry and the flavor was very mediocre. Overall I prefer the food to be simpler and less pompous.</text>

<Text>On my birthday (09/14/2020) we were supposed to eat here but we didn't get to taste their food because they couldn't find my reservations that were made the day before. After that the lady (That was the tall thin blonde lady at the small podium on the sidewalk before you go inside) told us she will give us a table within 15 to 45 minutes and took down my phone number, she never called and had us waiting for nothing. You could tell she didn't really take her job serious. They were closing after that so we couldn't eat there. Thank you for the bad dinner reservations. Hope this company finds new workers that care because they will receive bad reviews and lose customers.

Very trendy crowd and excellent sushi. The service is good but a little stern and the specials can be creative but not thought out enough. For example, too spicy and doesn’t match with the rest of the meal. The fish is high quality but standard fare. Nothing exotic but that’s probably ok.< /review>

I was totally overlooked when in line. Even though i was there to pick up a food order, the host didn't even acknowledge me. There were two girls in front of me waiting to be seated. Three people showed up after me and were waiting in line. Once the girls found their party he then saw me and walked around me to talk to the other people who he clearly knew. I was left standing there with no help whatsoever.  Luckily this nice girl was kind enough to offer some assistance. Places like this just tell me one thing, unless you don't look like them, you're just the expendable help.<//Text>

The classic Venice sushi favorite serving the freshest, most delicious sashimi and rolls. I also love their salads and sides - especially the crispy brussel sprouts and the vegan miso soup. Must haves are the spicy tuna crispy rice and the baked crab rolls. Sushi is fresh and perfectly presented. They also have a great selection of wines, including natural/organic options. And the Lycheetini is a real treat (the bottle is empty because it didn't last long)! I loved them when they were in their beloved spot on Abbott Kinney, and am sure the new location on Rose will soon win my heart, as well!</Review>

Stopped by for drinks before dinner next door (at Tasting Kitchen). Next time I'll stay for dinner at Wabi Sabi. Fun cozy bar scene - romantic dining room in back. Great vibe.<//Text>

Excellent food, atmosphere, and music selection. The Karaage chicken is a must. Not a sushi fan, but what I tried tasted fresh and was a very large roll. Friendly staff, definitely a better spot for a date or small group dinner than a large group.<//review>

Mother's day dinner at home with wabi on rose sushi. Beautiful. GrubHub stole my order, after an hour with them on the phone this food will not be arriving. Called Wabi fifteen minutes before closing to reorder. Sorry I forget his name but brought me my order himself with mother's day flowers and a new mask. Food is incredible but service steps out of the box. Recommend 100 percent. Thank you for making my mother's day dinner. Sincerely karen<//text>

We waited for a table for over an hour.  Everybody else got seated in front of us.  Rude hostess.  Finally she wanted to give us the worst table in the house outside in the Cold.  Very disappointed to be treated this way specially as a return customer and local residence.  So we left, not sure will return again.</review>

Upon exiting the Lyft you're greeted to a lovely, vibrant street scene that is colorful and lively. Once you enter, the bar wraps around one side of the room with unique individuals sipping what seems to be concoctions out of a speakeasy.  I was almost tempted to have a seat but the hostess, with the mostest (sp), Ms. Kim, greets me with a smile as wide and bright as Chester da Cheetah and asks "If I'd be dining or drinking tonight?" My reply, "both", "Well I have the perfect table for you."

I started with a seaweed salad and a Green Tea-Wi. The Japanese whiskey in the Tea-Wi was flavorful, full bodied and just delicious. The seaweed had just the right amount of crunch to compliment the drink, since I'd chosen the drink first.

My dinner was a Sashimi Plate. An assortment of perfectly apportioned slices of fresh fish that dissolves in your mouth quickly, but slow enough for the taste to linger...Salmon....Red Snapper....Tuna...Yellow Tail, aww the YT was supreme and Halibut was glorious.  All were delicious and tasted like they were just cut off the whole fish in the back.

Brent, the restaurant manager, learned that I had just arrived for a meeting at 2pm and that I'd be departing at 5am. So he wanted to do something special since I'd chosen his establishment for my first and last meal of the day.  He ordered a Signature Dish called "The Ava".  Heaven help me find room in my stomach to eat all 6 pieces of this seared salmon, ponzu, micro greens, Farmer's Market Fruit, Serrano, truffle oil and a little Magic dish. Ever have a blueberry dipped in truffle oil? Neither have I! But the raspberry dipped was fabulous. Especially with the seared salmon! I'm done, stick a fork in me!

My server, Lindsay, kept the drinks flowing...flowing.... did I say Flowing?! The Smoke & Salt was the liquid dessert that made me feel like I was floating in air. Well done Wabi Sabi, well done<//Text>

The sushi was colorful and fresh, and the two desserts were great, both were gluten free and one was vegan also, the manager gave them to me on the house even because he was bringing it to another table and I got so excited about gluten free desserts! The shashimi bowl is a work of art! A neat place overall!<//Text>< Pics>

As an avid sushi eater in New York, this ocean side sushi joint does not disappoint. Amazing fresh fish and refreshing cocktails! If you’re dining in ask for Adrian. he’s got great recommendations, is hilarious and handsome. A triple threat!</review>

<review>What a fun date night place.  My husband felt like having sushi that night and we wanted to take a stroll down Abbot Kinney.  I did some research and looked at the pics and figured why not let's try this place.  I am usually very weary of trying new SUSHI restaurants because I am nervous  about food poisoning.  Everything from the service, food, drinks was amazing.  The restaurant had a lively vibe which made date night a success.</review>< pics>

This place is aesthetically beautiful.  The decor, the wallpaper, the lighting - perfection!  My only complaint is The Moon.  The server recommended it and, to put it nicely, it's not the best tasting thing on the menu.  I had some friends go the night before I went and their server recommended it too, and they thought the same thing.  Cool atmosphere, great service, great food - just not The Moon.</text>

Very noisy, so if you’re trying to engage a conversation, think elsewhere. But be aware that you’ll miss some excellent & delicious sushi!

Cocktails are interesting but costly ($15 each). Rolls are fine but not exceptional. Appetizers are actually more interesting I thought. Overall a solid sushi experience with usual drink options, but just a little on the pricey side for what it is.<//Review>

<text>The food is good and the place is cool, with nice decoration and interesting people and the drinks are good as well. It gets crowded though and it csn be loud for a restaurant, it's fine as a bar. I am still debating whether or not the food was good enough to justify the price.< /text></record>

Not bad but far from great. Sushi rolls were average. Spicy tuna and spicy salmon weren't spicy. Weirdly their wasabe wasn't even spicy! Location is good, restaurant is nice and our waitress was very pleasant. Even the sushi chefs waved! Sadly they should have been concentrating on thee food.<//review>

Amazing first experience at Wabi Sabi! My boyfriend and I, very last minute, decided to get dinner and did not expect to get a seat. The place was packed and the kitchen was closing soon. Luckily, the hostess Rachelle managed to get us a table and was extremely accommodating! She was the reason we stayed and had the best dinner date yet in Venice. The food was great and servers were friendly. It's tough to find dinner this good and yet so unpretentious in LA. Will definitely be back!< /Text>

<text>Hip busy spot - nice decor/ambiance, though it was very cramped and noisy during our visit (seated near the sushi counter).

Our experience was 'just okay' - I can't see myself coming back, all things considered.

Sushi was decent - though nothing to write home about.  Comparatively expensive and small portions. Edamame was the best thing we tasted during our ~$200 meal for 3 - and it's edamame, so...

Staff was pretty rude/dismissive - which obviously stings, particularly when they bring the bill out far more quickly than anything else (including the bottled drinks).< /text><name>Matt Ezell<//name></record></dataset><record>

Fish was cut wrong. Rice wasn't made correctly.  The sushi is purely looks only.  The taste is less than satisfactory.< /Text>

Great sushi and an even better atmosphere for the late 20's early 30's crowd.<//Review>

<Review>A friend suggested this place. So we sat at the sushi bar, and José was our sushi chef. I can say without a doubt, that this was the best cut, presentation, and taste I’ve ever experienced with sushi. José is a master of his craft and it shows in his food. If you’re a sushi enthusiast, and you haven’t gone here yet. You haven’t experienced the best of what LA has to offer. This place will be in my weekly rotation. Get the Sunburn and the Yellowtail Special, it will change your life.</Review>< pics>

< review>
I was excited when my girlfriend told me she was going to bring me some to-go sushi from Wabi-Sabi. I looked on their website and picked a roll and she had it ordered (which was a difficult ordeal apparently, she had mentioned that the service wasn't great while she was there) What she brought home was an even greater disappointment. For $17 I received a sloppily put together, very small amount of fish. You could barely call this a meal! Maybe an appetizer (big maybe) but certainly not $17 worth of anything. You know Wabi-Sabi, there is something to say about value of money and a lot of people would prefer to not get ripped off for not great food. I know I love returning to a place where I feel like my money went a good way. Needless to say, we will go elsewhere when we want sushi from now on.<//review>

<Review>The music, the food, the cocktails and décor are all on point!  The vibe is chill but chic.  What impressed us the most was the staff!  As soon as we walked in our amazing experience started.  The manager Sterling greeted us with a beautiful smile and kindness.  She knelt down to speaker to our 9 and 7 year old girls and made them feel like the cool kids.  Our server Ben was on it from the start.  Everything we ordered was to perfection!  Sterling, was running around assisting every table with a smile and helping the servers out, bussers and making sure everyone was happy. Sterling took us on an art tour and showed us all the cool different pieces.  Provided us with a book from the artist that is featured.
It was the best meal of our entire Labor Day weekend!  I would go back again and again!  It has everything you want!  Just drinks, the bar has you covered.  Date night, the dinning area is perfect!  You want fresh Shushi done! You have kids don't fear they will have a blast hanging with the adults.  - Lance, Josh, Brooke, Ama, and El< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bb42d6f0ec09:0xd781970cc6010428<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went to Wabi-Sabi for a little pre-birthday-cocktail dinner with the SO. It had a large alcoholic bar section up front with a sushi bar tucked away at the rear. We found seating in the sushi bar.
First impression: a little too lush and distracting for a good sushi bar. Second and final impression: first impressions don't matter. The food was balanced, tasteful and well presented. The drinks were stiff-ish. The wasabi was real. Apart from the decor, nothing in the place puts you off balance. You should get some food here if you can. I'll want to go again if I'm in the neighborhood< /Review>

< Review>
was entirely underwhelmed and don't think that the food is derserving of a 22 at all - we got everything from the spicy tuna on crispy rice, the wabi sabi roll, various sashimi, crab handrolls, and everything was bland and generally uninspired.  our waiter never once cracked a smile and walked away mid-order because we were trying to decide on a dish.  had high hopes, esp since it's surrounded by some of my fave foodie spots, left disappointed.</Review>

I tried 3 plate of sushi, they were okay but not amazing! The service was awful, I was sitting by the sushi bar, the waiter didn't brought plate, napkin, glass and etc. They didn't even gave me soy sauce or wasabi with the sushi until I asked for it!< /review>

<Review>The food here is very average and standard - nothing unique about the rolls. The price is very high considering how little you get. Most rolls cost around $15 for 6 pieces. Honestly, nothing was very memorable other than the bill :/</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I go to this marvelous  restaurant once a month since I love the good mood that is unique to this place. The team is very welcoming and experienced. The service is pretty efficient. Also, the food you eat is magnificent. I ate there many times and I was always delighted. The rate is modest. I highly suggest this restaurant to to all.</review>

(Translated by Google) There is also an open terrace, so it is recommended to relax during the daytime on Saturdays and Sundays!

However, since there is no cafe, drinks are alcohol or soft drinks are grapefruit juice or cola.

How about a day when you want to drink relaxedly from noon?

(Original)
オープンテラスもあり、土日の昼間はゆったりしていておすすめです！

ただ、カフェはないので飲み物はアルコールかソフトドリンクはグレープフルーツジュースかコーラ。

お昼からゆったり飲みたい日にいかがでしょーか？</review>

<rate>2</rate><text>We ordered veggie enchiladas and rice bowl and 2 burritos (veg & non veg). Couple of things here, the tables were not cleaned there were left over plates from previous orders. The veggie tofu burrito didn’t have tofu at all and the same was with chicken burrito, they tasted the same. The service was very slow and only 2 people to manage a restaurant was a lil under whelming. We went with high hopes to try some new fusion but wasn’t satisfactory.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_WmJ0gWpo864V4pyGqQ1wpxIaXhb-p_EG_Ord=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmEQ0EtLpKfqZAuv3mCe7A_OYZEQdLZDulc79l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80859655f6acedef:0x810736c52fce4c1b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Such an amazing surprise to find this place.  After a long day hiking in Pt. Reyes we stopped here with a group from our hiking club. No wait, great prices and there was something for the hard to please crown from Vegetarians, Gluten Free, Meat Eaters, Spicy vs. Not Spice, Beer drinkers vs Teetotalers.</review>

our family, even kids, love Avatar's Fairfax.  The rice plates are so tasty and filling.  My elder son loves the curried pumpkin and I find the eggplant is delicious.  Across from Good Earth.  Try this unique Indian-American eatery.< /text>

Delicious food! We always start with the rock shrimp in fresh chutney and follow up with a curried pumpkin burrito! I *have* to go to an Avatar's every time I'm in Marin... they need to get more than one high chair, though.< /review>

Food is amazing, wonderful staff. Very friendly and helpful in your new experience. For me it was a wonderful taste melding of two flavors that I would never have had together were it not for Avatar's.... highly recommend!!< /Review>

Small chain that started in Sausalito. Amazing good Indian fusion food. Punjabi Burritos are the signature dish (non-dairy & non-gluten), like a cross between a Frankie and a Burrito. Good veggie options. Worth travelling 100 miles or more to experience!<//Review>

Love, LOVE this store! They have so much to choose from in storage options, I’ve been there many times since my mom passed earlier this year to buy boxes to store her heirlooms. And the young men who work there are always so polite and helpful. They are always a pleasure to deal with.</review>

< Review>
Awesome staff, super friendly, and helps you save on costs. I've had tons of customers of mine write back to me because they were so happy the way my product was packaged to them, little do they know it was the Box Zone not me who does the packaging. Highly recommend they have a ton of shipping/box supplies in the store. The best one stop pack/ship store I have found.<//Review>

<text>Flawless for any size ebay seller! They made the nightmare of moving so much easier too. The Box Zone has never failed us. We get our boxes, all the packing supplies we need, AND they pack and ship crazy fast. I've never had a problem there, and I would recommend The Box Zone to anyone.< /text>< user_name>

As soon as you walk into the store you can feel the staff here have high energy and are ready to help your moving, shipping or storage project. They have an incredible range of box sizes and can even make you a custom size box if you want. Five stars.< /review>

< Review>
An excellent resource if you need boxes - moving, run an eBay store, relocating a large amount of inventory, taking apart a Harley Davidson motorcycle then taking it to a person who knows how to put it back together because it didn't look that hard on Youtube..

The spot has a relaxed, no pressure staff who are knowledgable and friendly. The Zoners really seem to enjoy their jobs. Says something about the management right there.

The prices are way lower than Staples, Office Depot or The Home Depot on boxes. I don't know about their prices on shipping.

Oh yeah, they also ship things. All sorts of things. I went in once and the guy was shipping a stuffed swordfish! Another time, a car bumper. I wouldn't know where to begin to ship things like that. Well, I suppose it is a good thing I don't work here, then.</Review>

You know I've never used anything like this and honestly it was really easy to do. I didn't end up not keeping my appointment but the lady I spoke to briefly was really nice and helpful. I'll use this again in the future for sure.</Text>

I had a great experience with Instant Urgent Care.  It was easy to download app and enter require information.  I am home with a new baby and couldn’t begin to think of going into a clinic with as bad as I’m feeling.  The provider was professional and knowledgeable! Very impressed!< /Review>

<text>Doctor or whoever on telemedicine call was nice enough but big waste of  time!!!   No one on phone from instant urgent care told us that covid testing closes at 3pm.  I called twice to make sure I had the info correct and they said nothing about testing closing.  I, specifically, asked them how to get a rapid text and they told me I had to go through a telemedicine appt then doctor would tell us where to go to get rapid testing but never did they tell us what time they closed.  Website is very confusing too as to whether scheduling an appt at a local instant urgent care or the virtual telemedicine appt.< /text><date>1622500306847<//date><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I absolutely love Matthew Felix! He truly is the only reason I will go to Santa Clara Urgent care.  He’s friendly and informative and makes the visit a comfortable experience.   The staff is always very professional and readily available when needed.
Thank you!<//Text>

What a great clinic!!  I was experiencing some unusual chest pain.  The urgent care clinic closest to me in Blackhawk was closed due to shortened hours.  Searched other nearby clinics, and Instant Urgent Care was the next closest. I did not have an appt, and they took me in quickly as a walk-in. Marcia, the head nurse practitioner, is spot on and a complete joy to consult with. A very welcoming and friendly staff.  Clean facility. Highly recommend, and will be my go to urgent care clinic from here on out!< /review>

Great experience! They communicate clearly with you throughout the process and have adjusted well to the COVID environment. If you need a COVID test for traveling outside the United States, give them a call, set up an online appointment, then go get your test. I got all this done in a 2 hour time span with only 10 minutes spent at the actual clinic.</text>

<text>Needed to schedule a Rapid COVID 19 test ASAP. Booked a flight back east for Sunday morning & today being Friday I panicked as the airlines require a Negative test results or quarantine. I called my doctors office at 9am to see if they could me or refer me. I was told I would receive a call back. As of 3pm I had No call back. I called my insurance and referred Instant Urgent Care. Everyone I spoke with was friendly, knowledgeable and took the time to listen to me. There were a few steps, definitely worth it. All painless and geek friendly.</text>< Pics>

<Date>1619390136753</Date><rate>3</rate><text>We requested an immigration related checkup and certification. We got a prompt appointment slot and paperwork was smooth. However, the doctor took 45 mins to see us for 5 mins and did not explain the full process upfront. We needed multiple follow ups including a telehealth session of $99 that I was not convinced was required. The staff did not follow up on lab results which were ready in 3 days. A week later when I called the lab the clinic took multiple iterations to get the results to us. The job was completed satisfactorily, but the follow up was very stressful.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Provider hardly even looked up at the camera. I understand that charting is important, but this was a very impersonal appt. I believe that this is a difficult job, telehealth has a long way to go. But I feel more effort or a better attitude could be achieved easily.<//Review>

Amazing! After almost 5 years of suffering through inadequate, & sadly,  no health-care, for a miriad of reasons, I was able to sign up & be seen by a provider in under 2 1/2 hours. I was treated graciously, with dignity & respect for the 1st time in years! Thank you Instant Urgent Care!</text>

<Date>1616183605419<//Date><Text>Waste of my time for telemedicine appt; the doctor didn’t really seem to want to help when I said what was bothering me. I wanted to be proactive to avoid infection but he wouldn’t consider that as an option. It was 3 mins and felt like a waste. Had to go and set a general care appointment for days from now, even though  I’m concerned about how long I’ve had this. Essentially said to just go to the ER if it worsens. I’d do this again but only if I was truly sick; currently I am having more specific issues.</Text>< userid>

Insanely quick service. The doctor believed all of my concerns and even provided possible solutions before offering the next step of care. The doctor was also very personable, friendly, and honest. I’ve never had a better experience with any health care provider.<//review>

Traveling to CA from out of state and need a COVID test ( negative ) to return to Massachusetts. Website was super user friendly to upload insurance information and photo ID. Video appointment was immediately confirmed, I logged in at my appointment time and only slight glitch was a delay before provider logged in . PA was extremely professional and set up my appointment and it was immediately confirmed to me via text! Easy and professional in these crazy times!<//text>

<Text>There was an issue with the video feed that couldn't  be corrected, and the doctor acted like she couldn't use the audio to do a thorough triage of my breathing and cough. She was quick to dismiss my symptoms and acted like I was intentionally causing the video disruption. I had redirect her focus many times to actually examine my symptoms and give me the medical attention that I needed.</Text>< Response>

<review>Was surprised I was booked on my doc's day off and thus did not get to speak to her. Substitute provider was a bit demanding and decided to lay down the law which I did not appreciate. He cancelled my 90 day fills and demanded I get my lab work done asap. His bedside manner leaves to be desired and we had a very poor connection over the phone so I only heard half of what was said. I was told to call in to keep my prescription orders in effect and instead restrictions were put on them. Very disappointed and so still need to speak with my own doctor!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Everyone is very helpful and nice at the Urgent care on El Camino. I did not have a wait and the dr. was very good at assessing my symptoms and treating it effectively. Thank you</review>

At Santa Clara location, Tested for COVID and did not get results for 10 days. Totally useless. Other family member got results back from the county in 5 days. Video dr appt w San Jose location lasted all of 5 mins. No idea what my bill is going to be but will never use them again.</Review>

<text>I have been coming here for a while and my experiences just keep getting better.  Last Saturday, I made an appointment at the wrong Instant Urgent Care. This office took me anyway, with very little wait time. Malak, at the front desk, was very helpful and friendly.  Dr. Felix was professional and caring and has a sense of humor!. He took care of my needs and said if my cough wasn't better in 3 days to come back.  I did and further medication took care of the problem. Under, at the front desk was great. Best place to come if you need care in a hurry.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This is for the Santa Clara location. 10 stars! My experience here was great. I have had a bad cold with cough for several weeks and finally bit the bullet and came down to Instant Urgent Care. I am not a huge fan of going to the Dr , but the kind staff made my visit quick and painless. I was seen very quickly, within 10 minutes of coming in. The PA was very knowledgeable, really listened to me and I am very satisfied with my care. I hope I don't need to go back again soon, but when I need to see a Dr. again I will definitely come back. Thanks, Instant Urgent Care!< /Review>

I appreciated him listening to me.

Dr. Ma and I have more in common but I really had a good feeling with Matt. Thank you Matt!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
I've arrived to Instant Urgent Care at 5138 Monterey Rd, San Jose, CA 95111 on Sunday, 12/1/19 at noon. It was the nearest medical facility to my house. I accidentally cut my finger, and it was bleeding heavily. I asked if they can stop the bleeding. They asked  me to fill up the registration form and pay $20 co-payment. I was told that I need to wait from 30 min to 1 hour because doctor is busy with another patient. At 12:45 I was invited to the room, they check my weight, temperature, and blood pressure. Around 1 pm doctor look at my cut and said they have no medicine needed to stop the bleeding. They gave me several napkins to cover my bleeding and suggested to go to the nearest hospital emergency room, so I did.</Review>

<Text>I had a wonderfully efficient visit today, the staff was kind and efficient, as was the PA who served me, Alan.  He was accommodating and took care of my needs quickly, and educated me about preventive care as his recommendation, 🙏 🤗<//Text><username>Jeff Jenkins<//username><resp>None< /resp><date>1576464136938< /date>< Pictures>
