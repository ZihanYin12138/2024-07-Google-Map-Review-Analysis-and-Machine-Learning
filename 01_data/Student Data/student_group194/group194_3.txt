Nerds On Call has been invaluable in our peace of mind navigating the world of computers and the internet.  We have been with you since the very beginning.  On numerous occasions we have called upon them to fix problems, correct issues and ask techy questions.  We value them as a partner in running our business efficiently and they are always quick and knowledgeable enough to fix our issue in a timely fashion.
We have especially enjoyed working with Jeremy, Nick and Josh.  Thanks guys got being so good at what you do!  Golden State Office Furniture</Text>

I want Darius to move next door to me. Whenever I've need help, he has been there (so have others) and everything gets fixed. I don't completely understand how they know what to do but they never fail. I am completely sold on Nerds On Call. Whenever I get hacked or something weird happens, I call and they fix it. The people who answer the phone are polite and listen - actually listen! So do the techs. I'm an older user (heck, I'm 67) and I am respected and treated very kindly. Using the computer to me is like driving a car. I can drive a car but I have no idea why it works. That's me and my computer. I don't panic, though. Nerds On Call is my go to. If you invest in one thing, invest here. This is the best money I ever spent on my computer. I wish my car had a service like this!</review>

My computer was running so slowly..... I thought I needed a new one. It turned out it just was loaded with junk and some questionable programs. When it was all cleaned up and appropriate updates made, I discovered I didn't need a new machine. Well worth the time and money.<//Review>

I have a 2011 MacBook Pro that had gotten to the point where the operating system would not update and I began to have applications on the computer that would no longer work. They were able to get my computer updated as well as cleaned up. Took some malware off the computer and things are now working great. I am pretty sure I now have another two years before I will need to replace it. Nerds really know what they are now my go to folks for computer help.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Very fast and professional computer repair and service. It is typically more difficult to fix hardware issues on laptops compared to desktop computers since it requires you to take them all apart, and laptops are not as simple. But they were able to clean out my computer fans, re-do my thermal paste, and fix an issue where my screen stopped functioning in 2 days.
Overall very happy with the service and quality. When my computer came back to me it was so clean I thought they just swapped it out for a new one. It looked brand new. I never even asked them to clean the outside of the computer before they returned it to me, but they did it anyway which shows that they'll go the extra mile before returning it to you. So that when you get back your brand new-looking computer it can look like they did a good job on the outside as well as on the inside. Thank you.< /Review>

I worked with a technician remotely today. He was able to identify my issue and provide me with advice on the options to resolve the problem. He clearly explained what was needed and answered all of my questions. I'm now confident in what steps need to be taken and know who to contact for future assistance. Would highly recommend!<//text>

<Text>Everytime I use this firm, they impress..All the Credit goes to Steve C in Sacramento. I was having a terrible time trying to get my tower to recognize my View Sonic Displays, using a Digital Connection.

In less than an half an hour, Steve  C. had me disconnect all cables, etc. and reconnect with my Monitors Digitally.  Took me more time to do all the connections than it took him to tell what to do.  Prime Service.
This was my second experience with Nerds on Call, and it turned out just like my prior one. They are super nice, smart, and efficient.. I'm glad I have registered with them.<//Text>< Pics>

Basically, I had an issue logging on to any internet web site through my Google Chrome.  I got connected to Darius G at Nerds on Call, and he worked me through a solution over the phone.  Very satisfied on this end.</review>

I am not completely computer illiterate but often feel that way. It doesn't matter what my issue is they come to the rescue immeadiately. What takes me hours to try to figure out what I did to mess up any area they usually fix it in less that 3 min.  Without them I would be spending a lot more to take the computer in every time I do something stupid.  Love my Nerds!</review>

<Text>I have so much peace of mind knowing I have my own little "IT" department (Thanks Kaili!).  I would've likely just tossed my laptops and bough new ones (more than once) due to my lack of tech knowledge had it not been for Nerds On Call.  This is a money saver in my eyes.

This is one of the best investments I've ever made.  These people are GOOD!  Whenever I have a computer glitch I can't solve, I just click the Nerds icon, tell them the problem, answer a few questions, and then go away.  When I come back, the problem has been solved and my computer is working perfectly again.  They are worth every penny!<//text>

My first experience with the Nerds On Call was spectacular--beyond expectations. I had an adware mess that blocked my screen with pop-ups and an error message that told me to reinstall a dll that I could not touch. Sam C. fixed it in record time and then tackled the "missing" camera I'd never been able to access since I bought this high powered gaming computer. Thank goodness I was presentable when the camera quickly snapped on!!  Back in business thanks to Sam C!<//Text>

I contacted nerds on call and received prompt and professional resolution.  I was not getting sound on my speakers and attempted to resolve it, but failed.  The tech expert at nerds on call not only resolve the issue but remove malware and corrected other issues too.  I strongly recommend this company.</Review>

<Text>These guys are the best. They did major repairs and got my computer up and running -- and saved all my files -- in just a day and a half. It is working better than ever and I thought the price was great.  I really appreciated that they did not "talk down" to me and make me feel foolish about asking questions.  I'd never hesitate to recommend them to anyone.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I can't even remember how many times these guys have saved my computer and my sanity.  They spent hours working on a MS update that did not want to install on my laptop and then they cleaned things up so that everything synced and worked efficiently.  My printer kept losing its connection to my wireless and they made it work reliably from any device.  They are magicians.</Review>< pictures>

Excellent service! they dove deep into my laptop system to update the bluetooth divers. Unfortunately due to  upgrades in Win 10 and the age of my laptop and the external speaker the connection to the bluetooth external speaker cannot be reestablished. But the diagnostics and the technical expertise  was though. and efficient Just another case of electronics obsolescences and that the Nerds can't do too much about.. Time for  me to be a consumer and buy new stuff and add the e-waste tonnage.</Text>

I love my nerds, since I was not born with a computer in my hand like my sons, it has been a real help to have them on-call, if you are not a techperson I would absolutely recommend this service.

Very professional. I had dropped my laptop and ordered replacement pieces only to find out that replacing those pieces was a little more intricate  than I thought. They charged me their base price and didn’t up charge me for bringing my own replacement pieces! They even ran diagnostics for the whole pc just to make sure the outer shell wasn’t the only thing that cracked with the fall.

I’m very satisfied with the work they did and they were very communicative about how my pc was doing while it was in their shop. I just got it back and it works great! I would highly recommend to anyone who’s looking for hardware help.<//Text>

<review>These guys and gals are the absolute greatest!   They restored my computer and my life.  I did not lose any data and my old computer is running faster and better than ever.  And the cost was very reasonable and inexpensive for the hours they spent.  Their follow up online service goes beyond anything available out there in this day and age.  Truly the BEST!< /review>< user_name>

I have needed to call for help several times. Every time they respond quick. I mean quick like within 5 or 10 minutes, they are on and into fixing the problem.
They are polite and take time to explain any questions you have. It is the best insurance you can have for a computer.
Rick is the guy I have dealt with the most, But I Highly recommend any of these guys.
Here it is about 3 months since I wrote the above report: I went on line with Firefox this morning (9/11/2019) and within a few minutes everything started running real real slow. After a few minutes I get a pop-up window saying Firefox has crashed. I called the Nerds and after working on it for about 1/2 an hour, everything is back to running great.
So nice to have piece of mind that no matter what happens, I can just make a phone call and with in a short time my computer is back to running great.< /review>

We must have unintentionally installed anti-virus program that rendered all our Word documents unopenable.  You were able to switch it to another system and saved my bacon.

<review>Got an error message when going thru boot up, couldn't resolve the issue myself, got in touch with the nerds,  they said to bring it in. Found that the hard drive was toast, so had a new drive installed and well I am now using my computer again.  YEA!  Gotta love your nerds!.  Having a small issue now and have them online with me working on the problem.  Have to say they are tenacious and will keep working until it is resolved.  Great job and kudos to all involved.< /review>< pictures>

And now, in December 2020, whenever I have had a question, they are always there for me!

Today, April 22, 2020, with all the restrictions of the pandemic in force, Nick not only explained to me over phone and computer how to connect a USB webcam w/ mic to my computer system, but also oversaw my enrollment with Zoom, and demonstrated to me how Zoom works.  What an incredibly skillful guy Nick is, and how incredibly accommodating he was in going the extra mile with me!

And today, June 8, 2020, Darius was a genius for cleaning up a couple of problems.  I love my Nerds!< /text>

THANK YOU Nerds on Call... soooooo much!!
I had the pleasure of having Christian work on my computer (remotely) today! He's a genius and I am so grateful I have Nerds on Call to rely on any time I have a problem! The plus is that you don't have to lug your computer in... they can do it remotely!!

Although I had no problem getting my printer to connect to my computer... I could not figure out how to connect my scanner to my computer! Just watching my screen as he expertly went from one program to another was exciting to watch! The knowledge and know-how these people have is truly amazing!

I highly recommend anyone who is looking for help with their computer to contact Nerds on Call!! I have been with them now for a number of years, and wouldn't consider going to anyone else, ever!!

Thank you Christian for your friendly attitude, knowledge and expertise! You are truly an asset to your company and I hope they appreciate all you do! Which is why I want to add... let him spin the wheel... just once!!

Thank you, from an extremely satisfied and lifelong customer!

I just finished a highly productive 75-minute online session with Autumn, a most competent and patient Nerd. She fixed some e-mail problems, then switched me out of Windows Live Mail into Thunderbird and synced two email accounts.  She gave me even more reasons to recommend Nerds to family and friends.<//review>

For those of us who are technologically challenged, what a relief to turn your computer over to Nerds, sit back, and let them handle it.  That, and the monthly tune up on the annual plan take all the worry out of using the computer.;</review>

<Review>I used to work for this company and they are horrible people. I got paid worse than the pizza guy at minimum wage making 30 cents a mile. Customers rarely tip as these rates are insane. A computer that needs a tuneup will run you $229 for something that takes less than 2 hours of work. The software used at this company is free and open source so anyone from Craigslist can do the same tuneup for a lot less. If Nerds on Call tells you that a part needs to be replaced, go and buy it yourself as their price markup is 2x newegg. Nerds on Call has taken the easy route and merged their accounting and repair locations into one small building making for a terrible work environment. Working for this company I can say that this was the worst job of my career as I literally was treated as garbage and starved while working there. If you are good person do the right thing and do not go to Nerds On Call.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I somehow got my desktop turned by 90 degrees and spent two hours trying to figure how to fix it.  I swallowed my pride and called my nerd.  In less than 60 seconds, he fixed it! Thanks, Jeremy.< /Review>

{'time': 1472492153205, 'text': "We are sorry that the information you saw Dan was not up to date. We did stop working on cell phones as it is often cheaper to buy a new unit than repair an old one with the level of technology found today in these small handheld smart devices. We wouldn't feel right charging almost as much as a new device, so we discontinued that.\n\nI believe our marketing communications now state this, but all of our staff will inform a customer as soon as they ask us for anything we don't do."}< /resp>

I can never decide whether or not i want a savory or a sweet crepe, but so far all the crepes that I have tried are delicious as well as the cookies and the smoothies. You can customize your crepes and smoothies, but they have some fruit combinations that taste great. This place will definitely satisfy any sweet tooth!<//text>

<Review>Had a great experience here. Super friendly staff. Great coffee and all organic. The tiramisu and crepes are delicious. I even got a 10% off coupon for my next visit. If you sit outside, you can watch the people walking up and down Melrose Ave. Beautiful design. Look up to see the umbrellas or look for the nutella wall.< /Review>< GmapID>

<review>Not bad for a nice small crepe place down in Melrose. Food is great and not to mention their smoothies and desserts. If you want crepes and your in Melrose come here! Just be careful of the parking.< /review>< pics>

This place is terrible. Flat out bad. The manager kicked my family and I out because my three year old daughter had an ice cream. Then followed me into another place of business. Shame on them. They are the low class businesses that give people who have an American dream a bad name. They should be put out of business for the disgusting and terrible way we were treated. Never again. Took all my strength not to retaliate.<//Text>

Cute place, good nutella crepes, wish the ice cream serving were a tad bigger. Place is kind of warm because no air conditioning was on, but what can you do.<//text>

Love the home style vibe of this place. Very mom n pop. Smoothies were bomb. I've tried the mango tango, strawberry mango and purple haze. Refreshing!</review>

Based on my cup of iced coffee, which was made fresh from espresso. Honestly, delicious! I'm so used to crummy iced coffee that when I had this I was reminded how nice it is to have a decent cup. I'll be back, want to try their macarons which looked delicious.< /review>

I paid for a drink in order to work on some work (stayed maybe 10 min) for my job and had a question for my business partner. I asked him to look at something quickly and he walked in the open air section of the cafe and looked at it on my screen without sitting down. The owners became agitated and uncomfortable and told us all to leave but then said I could stay if I wanted to after disrespecting my friends and business partners. I told them no and they over heard my friend talking. The male owner repeated the n word and said "I am not a n" with a hard r. I've never witnessed such racist  people in the workplace. On top of that these racist owners called the police on my friends after they understandably got upset and shouted at them over the derogatory term. The police let us go without a problem after realizing the situation.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>I have been working around Melrose for 20 years.  Have always been getting my coffee from different places until I found La Cream.  La Cream not only has the best and friendliest environment with all honesty they have the most delicious Americanos.   Their's is not too strong nor too diluted and unlike the big chains they do actually steam the cream and add it to the drink.  Thanks for being so good and professional in what you are doing.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

So I am not the person to dislike anyone or say anything bad about anyone but I was really hurt by the way I was treated by one of the owners. I travelled from Australia on my own and I was so upset by an experience. Ana the owner is a nice lady but her brother Stoli is a manipulator and naricissist I see straight through him and I would not trust him. He ripped me off big time. Also tried to get me to work at the cafe once so that I would stay in his airbnb longer but I felt intitutively something wasn’t right and he wanted to pay me $8 an hour is that even allowed?
Anyway more to the story but in my opinion when I think of Stoli I think dodgy mofo.

Anyway on a more positive note Ana was lovely and very accommodating and the way she made my ice coffee was amazing.<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80c2bed49590927b:0x7da3e29f0afc2009<//gmapID><review>Treated so terribly. I don't care if ANY place serves extremely delicious food and drink. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE DESTROYS BUSINESSES. One star, for having their doors open, and for a Great Business name. The name is what drew me in. Ordered an Americano and a macaroon, to support a local business. I accidentally spilled water as I was pouring it into my water bottle. I bent over to clean it up off the floor with a napkin and dropped my macaroon. Oops. I squished it back in the bag and let the man know what happened. He said if I want to eat it off the ground it is safe because he bleached the floor.
Then I said, "I didn't even ask you for another one because I expected that you would offer me a new one and not expect me to eat it off the ground."
He said he didn't expect me to eat it off the ground, but that he has seen some people don't mind eating it off the ground.
He asked me,  "What would happen if you pour your coffee on the ground?"
I replied, "You would clean it up."
"Of course I would clean it up, but if you pour out your coffee, you don't get another cup."
After a bit longer discussion, and feeling like pouring my coffee on the ground so he could clean it up, I asked if there is a way to speak to the manager or owner that he made reference to.
My parking meter is run out by now, but no ticket today, thank God!
The manager was on the phone and I told him that I dropped my macaroon and threw it away. "May I have another one?"
"Well ma'am, if you dropped it, you dropped it-"
"Okay, thanks. I gotta go. My meter ran out. I don't want a parking ticket."

I like to help out local businesses,  but it is small shops like these that encourage me to continue going to local Starbucks and Coffee Beans. Why? Because great customer service constantly given, without compromise to the product.
Here I felt customer service was compromised, why? No consolation, no restitution. No offer of a coupon for next time use. (A good reason to bring customers back in the store to give it another try.) If I come back, I will not expect anything. But honestly, there are so many other coffee shops that have a great atmosphere. Why waste my time and money on a place that hasn't figured out customer sevice, when I can be a consumer somewhere that appreciates the people that choose to stop there!<//review>< pics>

<text>Quick check in online , getting notified on the phone app and then eventually getting to the shop and checked in. The shop checked all the boxes when it came to be ready for all the sanitation and hygiene that needs to be followed during the pandemic times. After the cleanup of the station and the surrounding area i was asked to grab the chair and Julie happened to do the honors. She spent a couple of minutes initially with me trying to understand how exactly i wanted the haircut to be and as well gave great recommendations along the way.

All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend the shop and as well Julie in case she happens to work there the day you plan to get a good hair cut!!

Thanks Julie and Great clips.. See you next time!!<//text>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>5/5 for this location of Great Clips and 10/10 for the hairdresser, Julie, who fixed my hair. I had gone to Super Cuts a few days before and asked for 5 inches off and some layers. The hairdresser there took like 5 mins to chop off the inches and then basically refused to give me layers; it was an odd experience to say the least. When I went to Great Clips, Julie spent a lot of time combing through my hair and was just overall, very kind and diligent. It turned our that there was a half inch difference between one side of my hair and the other! Julie was able to fix it and she even gave me some layers. Greatly appreciate Julie and Great Clips for fixing Super Cuts mistake and for generally being way kinder.<//Text>< Pics>

Avoid this place at all costs!!!! I went in and asked for a trim with a few layers. The stylist kept arguing with me about needing more length taken off, and cut a chunk of my hair at 3 inches so I’d have no choice but to proceed. The stylists are severely unprofessional and have absolutely no regard for customer service. The stylist was petty (at best) and would not even apologize. Do yourself a favor and pay the higher price for a quality salon. It’s apparent these stylists lack experience or respect. They should be ashamed of themselves!< /Text>

<review>Went to get a cut, as i just had one bu a really nice 40- 50 yr old shorter lady, best cut in years!! Ypu lnow that gut feeling you get...when approaching a salon that has crickets chirping; and the staff are many?! Shoulda followed it, as they butchered my hair, almost if not on purpose. The clip hits the ground and instead of hetting another, just wings it freehand. You didn't even do, wait; no no don't lets just comb it!!

Luckily hair grows back, businwss doesn't. Its an empty store front  for a reason; shoulda followed instinct. If yours  leads you astray, read this post seriously. I speak with my wallet, as we spend far too much for poor service; not no mo.< /review>< userid>

Fantastic job. I had Rebecca and she was amazing. She asked me so many questions about my hair, told me what she was going to do to it step by step, made some recommendations, and always asked to make sure she was doing what I wanted. I've never had a hairdresser that cared so much. I have a simple hair style as a teenage boy but she still did things to my hair to make it look good that no one has ever done before. I might have just been deprived from good hair care previously but she was good.< /Text>

<review>They messed up my hair and the stylist didn't even speak or understood English.
She kept saying "I didn't do anything" when i just told her to brush my hair as it was so uneven.
Her response was your hair is curly and i didn't do anything.
When i complaint to the owner she was rude and informed me that it was my fault.
If you don't want to wear a cap till your messed up hair grows, stay away from great clips.<//review><date>1508353644480</date>< username>

The staff is usually very nice and friendly, but I've had a couple of kind of cold or not so friendly reminder experiences. $17 for a haircut that lasts < 15 minutes is a little expensive, but overall it's a decent place to go to for a quick haircut.</review>< date>

I have gotten some nice haircuts here in the past.  In the past I got a haircut without getting on their Christmas card list or whatever they want my personal details for.  But anyway I left with no haircut because of their insistence for having a file on me.</text>

They'll take people who checked in on-line  first before walk-ins no matter how long walk in people have to wait.   I was watching 5 people who came in after me got serviced because they checked in on line. They ignored  that I was sitting there waiting .
Why they have a sign in front - walk right in-?  That sign was the reason I walked in.  I had no idea when I'll get my hair trimmed so I decided to leave.  Very very irritating people who is working there this evening and providing bad service!.  Never go back to this place ever!<//text>

<text>I had two cars in need of repairs. The first car had an ignition issue that I could not tell how bad it was.  I communicated that the car was going to be sold and we weren’t prepared to spend a lot on repairs.  They were fast and very communicative.  They laid out my options and recommended the lowest cost because of my intent to sell.  The second car needed much more repair and was being kept.  The diagnostic was complicated but they made contact at every step to keep me informed and get my consent to continue.  They repairs the air conditioning assembly and made recommendations about repairs for other issues found upon inspection.  The brakes were replaced and valves and spark plugs changed. They were supportive and respectful of what we did and did not choose to repair.  They were respectful of our time and finances.  I will go here for all my future repairs and maintenance.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>I couldn’t seem to get a diagnosis for why my check engine light was by any other auto service. Charlie let me know that “they would seek out the issue by hand and a good eye” they found the problem and within 24 hours I had my vehicle back repaired. I’m smogged and registered! I recommend Auto Diagnostics and Repair! Thanks so much!< /text><time>1626395118331<//time>< UserId.>

If you’re not getting your Vehicle checked by Charlie and his crew then you should definitely give them a call. They fixed major issues that were required to be fixed in my car. They did it with ease and in a timely manner. The front desk personnel can help you feel welcomed the moment you step in their door. Amazing customer service and satisfaction Guaranteed! I will be recommending Auto Diagnostics and Repair to friends and family; I myself will be coming here for all my future car service needs. Thanks Charlie and personnel for all your help.

We took our work truck in for a flickering light and overall vehicle diagnostic.  Received calls daily on our vehicle and outcomes of tests.  No tests were done without our approval.  Husband created a good relationship with everyone.  Took great care of us.  Will be using again for all our vehicles</Text>

<review>Brian and the staff at Auto Diagnostic and Repair are truly a pleasure to work with.  I had tried many other shops in the area before I found them and I am  now a loyal customer of over 15 years. Why? They are truly the gold standard in their industry. They stand behind their work. They have Integrity, they are reliable and they truly care about their clients. When my truck broke down on a busy highway recently, and AAA refused to give me a ride, they didn't hesitate to come out and pick me up. I will continue to refer people to them with confidence and I wish them many more years of success!< /review>< pics>

< review>
Came here for a fuel pump, throughout the process wrong parts were shipped, other issues arose, and my anxiety level was on 10 as I knew nothing regarding cars. Brian and Charlie really stepped in and treated me as family to make sure I understood what needed to be done step by step and I left here feeling confident and grateful to have Charlie fix my car. I am thankful to have found this place and recommend to all, especially as a woman and little knowledge with vehicles. Thank you guys.<//review>

The work was faster than expected, very professional. Brandon stayed on top of everything down to diagnostics, costs, and recommendations. He went into detail with me on exactly what was going on so I could understand and make decisions on what I wanted. Great communication I knew everything that was going on with my car...Love this auto repair shop will return for work in the future..<//Text>

Charlie was great. Explained what needed to be done. Glow plugs were replaced. ADR’s service was fast and furious. No excuses, they get the job done. Good to see there’s still a shop you can trust.< /Text>

<Text>The service was fantastic! They were able to help fix our problem with our car the same day that we called. They were very communicative and affordable. The parking was easy and the shop was easy to find. Nicole and Brian and the rest of the team were extremely polite and helpful, especially since the previous shop that we had gone to with the same problem actually made our car worse. Thank you, Auto Diagnostic & Repair!!</Text><gmap_id>0x808559de7637ab4f:0x95df90f6891e0bd6<//gmap_id><name>Jeremy Jones<//name><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Because of the Pandemic, things are different. You have to go in the office to set the guidelines on the work that's needed  2  person minimum, I seen a board that was for the customers safety of their comment to us and don't worry they got you. Service is done time to leave they gave me my key back sanitize walk me to my car wiped down the handle took the mat away and sanitized the steering wheel!  😄 Is that CARE or what.
Thank you Brian and Nicole for this experience. Barbara<//text>

I was very impressed with their service!  They took great care of my daughters car.  They were prompt, courteous and kept me informed.  Their covid precautions were thorough and left me completely at ease which was important to me due to my daughter being immune compromised.   My ride was so impressed that he scheduled his own service for the following week!</text>

<Text>I was told to bring my van in at 8am and I did. They said they work on it all day and they let my van sit in parking lot until 3:30 when I checked in around 3hrs hours for  status report I was rudely told that there were 20 cars ahead of mine and I had to wait your turn. When I mentioned that at 8am I didn't see that many cars on the lot I was told that they had drop offs. This is the same mechanic that worked on my van only to have it mess up two days later which cost me a 2nd towing to their shop. I've been going to mechanic shop since 2017 and I never had any complaints like this one and the manager kept yelling saying I understand I understand over and over blowing me off. THE MANAGER BRANDON WAS VERY RUDE AND YELLING AND THE MECHANIC LIED AND KEPT MY VAN ALL DAY FOR NOTHING UNTIL I CALLED THEM AT 3:30 THEY NEVER CALLED LIKE BRIAN DID WITH ANY STATUS. AND THE 3000 PRICE IM GETTING  THE EXACT  PRICE FOR PARTS AND LABOR FOR 149 DOLLARS. BRANDON SUCKS AND THE MECHANIC SUCKS EVEN MORE I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS SHOP WHILE BRANDON AND CHARLIE WORK THERE!!!!! The repair needed because at fast speeds I lose steering and slower speeds  it's okay, I could've had it for the day since they couldn't  work it in and from 8am --3:30pm which they should've  told me that way before I called them at 3:00pm a test drive was all they did then gave me a 3000 dollar estimate which for the same repair I'm getting  done for 149 dollars that includes parts and  labor.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Brandon quickly diagnosed the cause of a check engine light on my truck. He was able to fix the cause of an emission release from the gas tank to avoid having to replace the gas tank which would have been a much greater expense. I recently moved back to Antioch and I think I've found my "go to" auto mechanic.<//text>< Date>

Lemme start off by saying I called a bunch mechanics in this area for engine issue, and and this is easily the most professional and trustworthy around, they do a full inspection and diagnostic for free and then they tell you what's really going on with your car, and are very good at communicating with you through the whole process and their price is unbeatable I recommend giving them a call for any type of vehicle service you need and ask for Charlie he's really nice and won't bs you!</text>

<Text>Brandon and everyone at Antioch Diagnostic & Repair were so amazing with my truck. I busted my wheel, and ball joint on my new blazer. They ordered all the parts and kept me updated the whole time with how everything was going. They even threw on a new grille I had bought for it! They are very affordable and do great quality work. I will definitely be coming back if I need any work done in the future. Thank you to everyone at Antioch Diagnostic & Repair for getting my blazer back on the road and looking brand new again</Text></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been taking my car & my family’s cars here for several years now.   I always receive friendly, helpful customer service & quality repair work.  No high pressure sales tactics, no unexpected charges on the invoice, ever.  They have even helped me prioritize repairs when I couldn’t afford to do everything at once.   I really feel this is an honestly run business & recommend them to anyone needing service on their vehicle.</Text>

I am so glad I brought my vehicle here! The whole team has excellent customer service and professionalism, and they are experts in their field. Brian called me with updates as he had them, he was clear and honest about what my truck needed and what the costs were, and the pricing was very reasonable. I won’t be taking my vehicles anywhere else from now on.<//Text>

<Text>SUV overheated while parked and idling. Their shop was less than 3 miles away and AAA approved by Auto Club, which means service is warranteed. Although they were busy (towed on a Friday, returned on a Tuesday), the communication was stellar with respect to text message link to estimate, what to authorize, follow-up phone calls. Primary reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that I felt labor was high to replace several hoses that blew plus a fee for subsequent check to ensure vehicle was working properly afterwards. It's the first time I've had radiator/HVAC hoses go out on any vehicle in well over 25+ years, so my surprise seeing close to $1k out the door was astonishing, let alone seeing the sadness and anger from my wife after telling her what the final cost was. Everyone we spoke with from arrival to pick up was wonderful and truly cares for the customer. Just trying to get past the pricing aspect.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Awesome people, Brian is very professional. Room the time to tell me what he needed to do to fix the smog problem on my 4runner. Had to wait at the shop as I live a far away from them and was an awesome experience. Did not feel like the regular shop where you just wait around for your vehicle, had good conversations/lunch with Brian and his awesome daughter Emma  while waiting for the parts to get there. Felt like I knew them. As far as the car issue, it's been a month and no issue with the problem it had<//Review>

I took my Honda Element in to Auto Diagnostic & Repair for a second opinion on a few issues that my local Honda dealer, for the most part, misdiagnosed. They were extremely helpful in doing only the most proactive & cost effective work. They saved me more than half of what I could've spent at the dealer! Thanks guys!!!< /Review>

NEEDS ZERO STARS.
They TOTALLED out my very rare truck!
More concerned about upselling then repairing!

LONG STORY BUT WORTH THE READ.
Took my 2008 King Ranch Expedition EL 4x4 for A/C recharge the summer before this incident to this shop and was told had a slow leak in the condenser but would probably make it through the summer with a freon recharge. At the end of the following summer I had enough with the A/C taking 30-45 minutes of highway driving for the air to get cold. The wife took the truck in and asked them to complete the repairs THEY had diagnosed from before. After also recommending a new radiator, that was very slowly leaking water from the seam, I agreed to the radiator as I was told the A/C condenser was indeed leaking freon and needed to be changed to fix the A/C. The tech and the desk lady both ensured the A/C would be fixed and a future water leak would also be averted; fine. After a week in the shop, I picked up the truck at 10am on a Friday (~80° outside) and the A/C temp felt exactly the same as it did the week before. Went right back to the shop and they confirmed the A/C system was full of freon BEFORE they started the work!... NOT leaking freon! Why then was $1,300+ of work and parts changed out and no proper diagnosis was made?! The leak they visually identified in the condenser was actually the Power Steering fluid collecting dirt through a very slow leak. Power steering lines run through the A/C condenser in many Fords and notoriously leak. The very rude tech, with metal @#&t hanging from his face, left a hose clamp for the transmission line off the new radiator. This cooked my transmission as I was driving later that day on the freeway when the hose blew off the fitting. The entire paint, underbody and engine bay was drenched in Transmission oil. Hydraulic oil is usually corrosive to paint. So AAA found that the Transmission got damaged when the oil drained out and the truck may possibly have electrical issues and need a new paint job in a few months if the clearcoat starts to peel. So they totalled it out. Left my family of 6 without a vehicle for six months until we could find an equivalent replacement that was CA smog legal. Thanks Auto DIAGNOSTICS for not actually diagnosing my A/C, it cost my family a truck that they all loved. Ended up with a totalled vehicle and A/C was never repaired properly by admission of the shop owner. Thankfully AAA and BofA are great and covered our loses. But nothing repairs this horrible experience as the used replacement vehicle was 2x the cost of the '08 King Ranch.<//Review>

<Text>As I walk into the shop the very first to stand out was a welcoming and genuine attention, the direct conversation I had with Brandon convinced me of his knowledge of automotive maintenance, not only did he listen but an actual mechanic test the vehicle and point out the exact problem and gave me an affordable estimate on part and time of repair.  I am pleased with this business because of the personal interaction and immediate solution to my problem.<//Text>< Date>

Very nice experience given that you're at a shop with people you've never met.
Great people, from Brian, awesome young lady Emma and one of the guys that works there ( didn't catch his name, goatee and cap).  professional yet very down the earth folks.

Know where to take my old chevy now as they work on all types of vehicles, not your typical "specialize in certain vehicles" shop.<//text><GmapID>0x808559de7637ab4f:0x95df90f6891e0bd6<//GmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

<name>L Baker</name><Review>This is our 2nd visit to Auto Diagnostic and Repair.  Our son recommend I take my car to Brian, because he trusted them. I now trust them as well.
Brandon and Brian have been very informative, helpful, and the prices are reasonable. I have enjoyed both experiences. The 2nd visit we brought my husband's car in as well.
It is now our family's auto maintenance and repair place. I would highly recommend them to everyone.
Thank you!

<Text>Great customer service, Manager took the time to look at options. Location offers a good 'repair club', that I think would be great for customers. They recommended another Repair Shop for what work I need.  //A2B//< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808559de7637ab4f:0x95df90f6891e0bd6</gmap_id></record>

I was super nervous dropping my car off like takin your baby to daycare lol anyway they did an absolute fabulous job with my Audi (which is a hot mess) but they got me headed in the right direction on getting everything finished up.

<review>I think the words that best describe this shop are thorough and professional. No games. You get quality repairs with a full explanation and assurance that when you leave, the car is working perfectly and you have no worries. I love that feeling of confidence. Brian the owner is great! His passion is cars and you can feel it immediately.

Add to that really nice people who will bend over backwards to make you happy. My wife and I are so happy to have found them!</review>< resp>

<Review>Every time I have been to this shop, either with my friend or alone,, we have received the BEST SERVICE!!!!!!
Today was no exception...
My car wouldn’t!t start so I had to get a jump...
The young man told me one of my battery terminal wires was bad ....
I said I know the only place to go!!!!
I went to Auto Diagnostic and Repair and was helped immediately!!!

They had me up and running within 30 minutes,
gave me a bottle of water for my stressed out parched throat and gave me a beautiful rose!!!

I am so grateful to you all!!!

Thank you!!!

< Review>
I have been going to Auto Diagnostics for close to five (5) years.  I have a 1991 Ford F-150 Custom pick-up and I can proudly say that I am the original owner.  Brian and his crew have done the upkeep on my truck and each time they say, " this truck runs pretty good."  This has the original engine but his crew have performed the maintenance that surrounds it.  Brian may not personally work on every car but he always gives it his blessing before it is turned back over to the owner.  Yes, I have spent some money over the years, but you know what? It was worth it.  I got it painted to it's original color,, some new interior re-done.and i am always getting compliments. It has 198,000 miles and I take it one day at a time with enjoyment.  NO TRUCK PAYMENTS.  Thank you Brain,Christina and the whole crew.  You guys really took care of me.  All the best. Manuel Flores</Review>

I only have good things to say about Auto Diagnostic. I have had my Dodge RV in there for diagnostics, repairs, both minor and major, plus general maintenance. The staff are friendly and efficient. The work has been first class, priced as quoted and on time. They will happily give you a ride home and pick you up if the vehicle needs to be there for an extended time. I would confidently recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and customer friendly repair facility.< /text>

The owner, Brian, was very informative and professional, with a smile!  I am very happy that my Check Engine issue was fixed, and that I found a great and honest shop in Auto Diagnostic & Repair!  I would recommend this shop to everyone,  Including Family! ;) And when I went back for the follow up, Kris at the front desk, took care of it, and was professional, friendly and made me feel like a valued customer.  I would give Auto Diagnostic 6 Stars if I could ;)< /Review>

Auto Diagnostics and Repair has been caring for my cars for 9 years and I wouldn't go anywhere else. I trust them and they have proven many times that I can. That's very important to me and I wouldn't think of going to any other repair shop. Everything they do is top notch and professional.< /Text>

My experience at Auto Diagnostic has always been excellent.  They are honest regarding the repairs I need.  They never tell you what needs to be fixed, unless it really does need attention.

I have gone to Auto Diagnostic for more than 10 years.  I would never go anywhere else, including a new car dealership.  The people who serve you are polite and informative.  The owner, Brian sets the high standard for all the people at the shop.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR BUSINESS!

Auto Diagnostic is a clean, friendly, honest, complete shop.  I feel like a member of the family.  Everything is thoroughly explained and old parts validate the need for work.  The work is guaranteed and there is follow up.  I have been to many shops and dealerships and I am so thankful I found Auto Diagnostic.  I had surgery one year and received flowers from my friends at Auto Diagnostic.  Christine and Brian's advice is so helpful.  They go above and beyond the call of duty so many times.  Thank you!

Bad communication skills on the office girls part. Short temper, does not have the patients to explain just what exactly they're charging for. I will never come back here nor would I recommend anyone else, simply because they are the kind of mechanic shop that has poor customer service and can't be trusted. That was obvious from the tone of the rude girl they have making the phone calls. All I was needing to know from them was a ball park, THATS IT, A BALL PARK figure and she was acting like what nerve I had, how dare I ask how much the job was going to cost before repairs are actually done. I guess she was just wanting me to let them run with free range of my check book. Oh yeah, which that brings me to another point, the rude girl was actually mad at me for wanting to pay with a credit card rather than a check for some weird reason. It was more of a power trip than anything on her part. She must be the man in her world. LOL<//review>

I know when I take my vehicle in for service or repair I am treated with respect and the staff lessons to everything I say that is going on to fix my car the first time. Awesome staff and a dependable and reliable shop.

Brian and his crew of auto technicians have taken great care of things I cannot do myself (as a former mechanic) and has always been fair with us.

One time they worked about 3 hours trying to figure out a problem, and when they figured it out, they only billed me for the initial diagnostic fee. I authorized the repairs and he counted the diagnostic fee towards the repair.

I've referred several people to them as well and each person has called me later to thank me for sending me over there.

I would send my closest friends to them, and I have.<//Text>

My husband always took his truck to the Chevy dealer, when I made an appointment with Auto Diagnostic he was not happy with me.  After he got his truck back and it was running the best it had in years, he is now a faithful Auto Diagnostic customer like me.< /Text>

<text>My wife and I have 3 vehicle,  all of them have been serviced/Repair by this shop. The Staff are very knowledgeable and courteous when it comes to explaining the issues of your repair.  Their prices and services are very reasonable and HONEST.  I highly recommend this Auto Repair Shop to those individuals who feel that you are being taken to the cleaners,  This Shop will surprise you on how much integrity that Brian, Brandon and the rest of the Mechanics have towards their customers.

Update  on additional work performed.

On 07/27/21 I brought in my wife's 2001 SUV for suspected brake issues and vehicle inspection to reassure road worthiness and prevent unnecessary breakdown.  I first contacted Charles and also a pleasant young lady to go over concerns and information pertaining to my visit. My concerns were documented and forwarded to the technician.
An vehicle inspection and diagnostic was performed, brakes needed attention and other issues were brought to my attention.
Charles kept me in the loop during the whole process with constant updates and solutions. Work was completed and very reasonably priced! The customer service and professionalism that I received here was very "Old School" honest and upfront.  I would definitely refer this business to anyone who looking for  a place that you can be confident that the job will be completed correctly and be priced reasonably.
Thanks Brian and staff for your efforts.<//text>< user>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I tried to use the other shop located on Herndon, but the smog technician was not in. I normally do come to this shop for my other cars, so luckily they were open and ready to serve. When I arrived there was about six cars here for a smog, but it’s worth the wait. Pull right in, no appointment, and get served immediately. I think because of the coronavirus restrictions they have been closing one hour early at 5 PM instead of 6 PM. When we called last night, this was the case.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4SEE-V6UcLgutZI6EDKqtVED6apTc9pl0zHtZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJIyqkuSVGUsSQTx4BFb4GNaEJIq4otXxUQtnV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJpVWUuZLX0JsHF_2Ta40coKIFQHzrcFQq-IEz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWTbjMj30OE4U5tcFBIyhkGiny6NfWPKJAwwF1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4RQJceSpsWXRHcT4qLXaOwwJWSe_1V6-8ZtoW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

They send me 10% off coupons by email every time I'm due for an oil change, and if I forget to bring it they give me the discount anyway.

<Text>They have always been honest and fixed my vehicle. I had a 2007 VW Jetta, when I went to get smog at 3 other shops they all said I needed an intake manifold and is would cost 3-3500 dollars. I bought a new car, and tried one last time to smog the Jetta at Sunny Sky’s at Milburn. They found a bad sensor for $150 and smogged it !

My service couldn't have gone better! I'm a first time customer and because of the tech that helped me I am a lifetime customer! He not only explained to me what he did and what my car needed he also took the time to explain to me how  everything works(even with a line of cars). He treated me like a customer and not a number. Highly recommend valvoline!!<//text>

I've only been here for a smog, nothing more. They assisted me quickly and are pretty upfront with me with the issues I've encountered. Check online before you go in so you get your $10 coupon which it brings down to roughly $40-ish. If your car doesn't pass smog the first time, they'll only charge $30ish and your second run will be $10. This is awesome so you're not paying $40 for every run. Make sure you KEEP YOUR PAPERWORK for them to honor the agreement.  Gotta give a shout out to Edgar there, he's super helpful and happy to help.< /Text>

Went for a smog and radiator flush, no check engine light on beforehand then afterwards they told me I failed smog and we're trying to sell me on a fuel system cleaning multiple times even though I told them I wasn't interested and this would not help me pass smog either. From my understanding a smog check should not cause your check engine light to come on if it wasn't on beforehand. After this, a mechanic was trying to get me to go through him outside of the shop for additional services. Whole experience was super sketchy.</Text>

I take all my vehicles to this location not just for smog but other issues with my vehicles. They are very honest. I took my ford escape in for an oil change and the manager told me my oil was good. I recently took my ford expedition in for oil leaks and rather than take my money they insisted on doing the least expensive repair only after it was determined to be the more expensive repair then we decided to do the job.
These guys honest and professional.<//review>

< Review>
The employees all had great customer service skills and were very friendly. Quick service for smog check and they even let me know that my transmission needed hey service but did not pressure me to try to go with them but they did let me know the prices. Great experience, I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

I went here for a smog. They quoted me a discounted price over the phone and honored it when I arrived which I appreciated. I didn't have to wait even a minute before someone came to see what I needed. Was told they would start on my car right away when I arrived and that it would only be 15-20 minutes, but I ended up waiting about 40 minutes. Nevertheless, I would probably return here as the atmosphere is less sketchy than most of the other places I have either been to or researched. The staff don't seem overly happy, but are pleasant enough.</text>

I had a great experience getting my oil changed. The service was very friendly and professional. You can stay in your car or go inside to the waiting room. The price for service is great too! 1/2 price oil change for first time customers! We will definitely be returning for future oil changes!< /Review>

Forgot to check my air filters. They were filthy and they were ready to send me on my way after charging me $125.44 then I get charged additionally for the air filters. Then one time I changed the oil and they spilled oil all over the engine and while I was driving it was burning off and smoke was all over the place freaked me out thought I blew the engine on my Mercedes. I was nauseous after breathing all the smoke in the inner compartment.  There are a bunch of young people working there that don't know what they are doing. i do not recommend this place. On top of that really the only thing you get is an oil change for 125.00 and a few fluid fill ups. Not worth it. Do Not go there and lose your money. Just a friendly heads up. Terrible service. I would rather go to the dealer and pay more than have them do any work. Been there 3 times hoping for a change but its always babysitting their work.<//Text>

I saw this had great reviews so I decided to check it out on my lunch hour. As soon I drove up I had an employee coming out to take down my information and take my car immediately. I had the choice to go inside to their waiting area but stayed outside. It was hot but they had a mister and tarp set up so it was not bad. They have 2 little dogs which were so cute and kept me company. In no time at all my car was pulled out and they were done. I could not believe how fast and efficient they were.I had been prepared to spend my entire lunch hour there! I was in and out in less then 20 minutes. I am very pleased with this company. Very polite and friendly. Thank you!< /text>

Awesome smog shop, we we're in and out in no time at all. I recommend anyone looking for a smog to go to SunnySkys Smog! And their shop dog Smogy is the coolest little pup around!! Thanks again SunnySkys Smog. Great service.</review>

<review>Went in for a transmission flush before closing. Everyone was helpful, professional, and friendly. I relocated to Fresno so had peace of mind finding a great place to get my car taken care of again. I wonder about the bad reviews because this location is 5 stars in my book.<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Resp>None</Resp><text>First of all, people looking at the overall rating of this business should read the 1 star reviews.  Most can be discounted because they have nothing to do with the ability or integrity of the company.  If a senior citizen was denied the use of the bathroom while waiting for service to be complete, that was wrong.  Maybe there was a reason for it, like out of order, that they didn't want to give.  I used the restroom there so I know that is not the usual policy.  Those who felt ripped off because they didn't pass, we just had that happen and had to pay on the $10 on the second test, which I think is the cost of the report. No rip off.  The car had not completed the drive cycle after a repair to an emissions system component and thus failed.  After three weeks of trying the drive cycle, numerous unsatisfactory contacts with the dealer, and an offer by the dealer to check it out for $150 and further charges to do a drive cycle, which they said could take four days, and to evaluate the O2 sensor, and  $70 to run the smog test, we went back to Sunny Sky because they would test the not ready, run the drive cycle and evaluate the sensor for $90. As it happened my daughter did the drive cycle for the 15th time on the way there and the sensor was finally ready.  So, she passed smog and paid the $10. And we learned they check fluid levels now too.

I have taken many cars and trucks there over the years when they were on Sierra. We have had older high mileage vehicles that have had recent check engine lights and repairs to the emissions system.  We have never had a problem passing and they always asked if the check engine light was on or anything going on with the vehicle. They informed me that they couldn't test if the light was on and that if the vehicle hadn't been through the drive cycle that it would fail. And I know enough to know that some modifications or lack of repair can be a problem.  They only bad bit of information we got from everyone initially is that just driving the car 50-100 miles will reset the monitors, which is not true for all cars.

I highly and with full confidence recommend Sunny Skys Smog. I have not yet had oil service because they didn't do it on Sierra but will give that a try now, too.<//text>< user>

But the gentlemen here are so polite and helpful and Smoggy the dog was a great host! It took less than 20 minutes to get my car smogged (I went on a weekday @ 11am). I will be definitely returning!

Also be sure to grab their $40 dollar coupon! when i checked out it cost $40 even!

To everyone at SunnySkys Smog, thank you for everything and you all displayed amazing customer service and I will be a returning customer and refer you to all of my friends and family.< /text>< user_name>

Fastest smog ever! The guys came out to my car when i pulled up and had me out of there in about 10 minutes.  My sister recommended calling ahead and I was told that if I mentioned a certain employees name i would get $10 off. So not only were these guys fast, they were cheap!!</text>

<Review>The friendly, helpful, and professional staff at Sunny Sky's Smog make the state-mandated inspection as pleasant as one can expect. Expect to wait 15-30 minutes (about average) as your car is smogged, either in their air-conditioned waiting room or a chair adorned porch outside. Cold water for customers is on-site. After grabbing the $40 coupon from their website, it's about as cheap as you'll find for the area (smog certificate included). They are, of course, STAR certified. Overall, would recommend.< /Review><gmapID>0x809467ff55f610b7:0x32e1cb72e1e2fcc3< /gmapID><Date>1437239809117</Date><user>113536780677227375189</user></record>

This place is crap. All you get is the runaround for the simplest question and mine was WHY DIDN'T MY CAR PASS SMOG A YEAR AGO. I don't have the paperwork anymore so they have to look it up...well, look it up! Why is that only one person is capable of doing this and it's Tammy who is never in the building? Or at least that's what they want you to think. The guy put me on a soft hold while he spoke to her and she said she will look into it later. The guy returns to me saying she's not in yet but he'll have her call me later...really idiot!? Wow...<//review>

<Review>I would have given them zero if I could.  I have been a repeat customer to this place and they completely disrespected me.   I have a pretty old car and it's become one of those cases where the check engine light comes on on a regular basis even though I've had no running issues with it.  Apparently you can't pass a smog if that light is on.  It cost me $36 to find that out.  He said "we don't work for free".  I am not asking or expecting anyone to work for free.  It's my fault for not knowing this I guess but to tell me they don't work for free even though I didn't even complain about that is an insult.   I will never return and make sure all knows the way I was treated.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Just went to SunnySkys Smog, which is across the street from the DMV on Blackstone. They are so friendly and helpful! They passed my car, when at Smog Master didn't. It was a technicality since I moved here from Colorado. I'm beyond happy today because of these guys! Smog Master had me so stressed out thinking I had to change my Catilitic Converters which was estimated to cost $1500! Thank you so much SunnySky Smog for passing my car and knowing your business knowledge. Also I have to mention they have the cutest shop dog named Smoggy. ❤️ Also they had a great special, free second test if it doesn't pass and 1/2 off on an oil change. I'm beyond pleased and will recommend these guys to everyone!!!!!!</Text>< Response>

<Date>1463242236941<//Date><Text>I didn't know that a check engine light would mean highly likely failing a smog test. The employees saw the check engine light on knowing it would likely fail but made me pay and wait for 45 min anyway. They didn't tell me about the engine light issue until after. The ethical thing to do would be to have given me a heads up before charging me 40+ dollars. I hate people who do things like this. Such a rip off.< /Text>< resp>

<review>called asking what time they close at for a smog check. The man said if I make it before 4:30pm because they close at 5pm I can get a smog check. I arrived at 4:29pm and the man would not smog my car. Horrible customer service. Do not reccomend.<//review>< UserId.>

<review>I used to live right next to this facility at Sierra Meadows Apartments. I always got my cars smogged here since I arrived in Fresno in '08. However, today when I got my car smogged (4-9-2016), it was $50!!! What the...They even have a $5 off coupon on their website that neither of the employees offered me. I even told them I was a repeat customer. Well, no more. Not when other places in Fresno barely charge over $30. What a rip off. I even used to promote this place to others with the info from the frig magnets I had on my refrigerator. Oh wait...I just threw them away. SunnySkys Smog...it's more like DarkSkys Smog. Maybe these guys will wake up and smell the coffee. I never even figured I had to ask their price until I was handed my receipt and it was $50. Then they have the nerve to hand me coupons for discounts for oil changes at their new facility, like I would want to give them out to people I know after being gouged on my smog test? What? Even on the back it says 'GET SMOG AT COUPON PRICE.' What a joke. I hope they went out and had a few beers on the money they made ripping me off.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Went in for a smog a month ago and received a generic receipt that did not contain much information on it other than my vehicle license plate#. A month later and I still have not received my registration tab from the DMV despite being told by Sunny Sky Smog that they've sent the smog result electronically to DMV. To save some time, I decided to contact Sunny Sky smog to check and ensure they have my information in the system and have notified the DMV, rather than waiting on the phone for an hour with DMV. Two different representatives cussed me out over the phone and hung up on me even though I was calm and professional with them.<//text>

I paid 5 - 10 less than what other smog places wanted, and received quality service. Although everyone's expmooerience is different, that day I had dealt with several other shops that were either overcharging, contradicting with visual inspections, and/or just having that "F U pay me" type of attitude.

When I got to Sunnysky smog I was dealt with quickly and wait time was good. In fact the only reason I waited longer then 20 minutes was that the crew working there went above and beyond what was necessary to ensure my car was smogged. For example, they adjusted my throttle instead of sending me home, marked my timing belt for future use, helped me locate an air leak, and  check my catalytic converter serial number against a database to make sure it was legal, at no other cost than 25 minutes. The converter was crucial, as a DIFFERENT smog shop had demanded paperwork to prove it was bought before a law change instead of putting in the extra work to find out. In the end, for less than the competitors, I got superior service compared to previous experiences. I even had a good chat and a laugh at checkout. Highly, highly recommended.< /text>

< review>
Came in on a Saturday in April to get my GF's car smogged - nobody in front of us, and the service was excellent and super friendly, if perhaps a bit slow. It took 45 minutes to smog her 2016 Ford. The building is older, and the waiting room is warm, even when the temps are in the low 80s. They could really stand to put some shades or awnings over the 2 windows on the south side of the waiting room. At checkout, George showed us exactly on our paperwork where the electronic transmission receipt to the DMV was located.

All things considered, five star experience, but one star off for not being (nearly) as efficient as the service we're used to in Phoenix and Denver, where it's a multi-lane drive-through affair with computerized testing and automated rollers - there, we'd be in and out in 20 minutes, even on a busy day.  On the bright side, George asked us if we had their coupon, and joked with us about needing to print it out - he was kidding. Just knowing about the coupon (or saying yes, when he asks if you have it) gets you $15 off the regular price. =)</review>

This has been my goto smog shop the last few times I've needed to have a vehicle smogged.  I dont have any complaints with the smog service but the last time I was in I needed to use the  restroom.

[I'm diabetic and the 3 most common symptoms of diabetes are frequent hunger, frequent thirst, and frequent urination]

I asked the gal if it would be OK if I used the restroom (they have one right inside the office where you pay) and she said "NO, its for employees only".  I told her I am diabetic and explained that I would really appreciate it she would let me use it.

She again said "NO" and told me that the Valero Gas Station on the corner has a restroom and I could go down there and use their's.

To each his own - but for that I PERSONALLY NEVER INTEND TO RETURN

FWIW - I have six children and 9 grandchildren.  So, its not like the gal was saying NO to a kid or someone in their prime.  She was telling a repeat customer  -who's a grandfather - to walk down to the corner Valero to use the restroom.

What business -- where you have to wait to have service to be done  -- treats their customers that way?

If they're smart they will (or perhaps have already changed) their policy.  I am cleaning my desk and I happen to be going through business cards lying around and theirs is one of them.  Even though this happened a few months ago... I told myself at the time I would be sure to write a review and document my experience.  Well, it just so happens seeing their magnetic card - which I tossed in the trash - reminded me to do so.

So - in conclusion I am rating it 2 stars which is DISLIKE.   Although I really HATED the way the gal treated me I want to be fair in saying their performance on the smogging of my vehicles was not an issue.  I just personally don't intend to give them any further business and would not recommend them to my family or friends.< /text>

Dishonest, manipulative practices. do not go here. smog technician opened the hood, saw that the car wouldnt pass the visual inspection, yet he still connected the car to run the emmisions test. at the end he marked that the car wouldnt pass, not because it failed the emmissions test, but rather the visual test. he noted that i needed to have a part replaced, and then return. every other place ive used over the years is kind enough to let you know that if the car wont pass the visual inspection, they wont run the emmisions test.</Text>

Smog cert shop owners are about 1 step below used car dealers and pond slime as far as I'm concerned this business is a prime example.  Apparently you can fail a smog test for having the air box cover off your airbox.  Don't fail the emission portion but failed the visual.  All the parts where there and hooked up except for a stinky cover.  Been like that since I bought the car 12+ years ago.   Hasn't been a issue for the last 12 years that I have owned the car and now all of a sudden I fail a subjective visual on a non system component?  Beyond ridiculous.  Pissed away the fee to do the smog.< /text>

Sometimes when you go into a store and you see the people behind the counter some people look like they're lost but this store the people there are very helpful and always have a smile on their face and I love going into the store if I can give this store more than five stars I would give it 20 Stars< /text>

They are reasonable. I don't like the way they don't give all change due. If you are supposed to get 17 cents give 17 cents. Not 15!< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I wouldn't come here to get anything done.
There are tons of better places in the area and the money is just not worth such a bad job.
Here was my experience:
I got a basic pedicure and callus treatment (which wasn't really a callus treatment at all). My nails were poorly shaped, barely filed and even the polish looked bad.
Nail technician was very rough with me, did not use the correct color that I picked out, and was on her phone WHILE she was working on me. Not talking on the phone, like looking at her phone and scrolling with one hand.< /review><user_name>Daphne Riddle< /user_name><resp>None< /resp>< UserId.>

Mom had a pedicure & the tech “couldn’t find” the color she wanted. Not a huge deal but is important.

I had a full fill manicure. I had to ask 4 times to make them shorter. My biggest complaint is that I noticed a big defect in one nail. I was halfway home so didn’t have a chance to go back to get it fixed.

Would also say they are on the high side for charges. Basic pedicure + fill manicure was $87+tip. Our normal place is $55+tip. So I paid more and had a subpar experience.

Would not recommend.</text>

<date>1610034445887< /date><text>It’s a decent nail shop, kind of rush their nails. The quality is hit or miss depending on which nail technician you get. I wish they were all consistently great. I always enjoy the pedicures! Sometimes my nails are okay but most of the times they’re bad (orange). I also bring my daughters here and they also prefer a certain nail tech for their nails to come out how they want. Otherwise I only recommend pedicures here. I had to get my nails redone and pay again at another shop days after.<//text><rate>1< /rate>< GmapID>

Horrible!! I had to come here due to my nail girl wasn't available.  Ugghhh never again!!!! I paid 30 dollars more for a mani/ pedi and I have lumps in my nails! I told the girl you missed a spot and she started slamming things around.  And I never complain.  I still gave a good tip, and I  will never return!!!!! Stay away over priced for not so great service< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I use frequent this nail shop when I first moved to the area and the service was wonderful! I hadn’t been in a while, but visited recently and got a “Deluxe Pedicure.” The person providing the pedicure was very rushed, distracted, and kept walking all over the salon, and looking at her phone excessively. I’m also not sure why this person thought it was acceptable to paint my nails prior to applying the exfoliant and cooling gel??! In addition they kept asking if I wanted a gel pedicure several times to which I replied “no” as the gel/curing is too harsh on my nails. I know this person heard me, completely disregarded what I said and proceeded to get the gel lamp. This was a extremely annoying because I already knew what service I wanted and asking someone the same question over and over again because you simply want to sell them a service is unacceptable. I will not be returning here as the service was not professional and therefore unacceptable.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

No such thing as an "appointment". Did not do my manicure same time as pedicure, as I was told they would when I called to make sure I could get in and out fast. It took 2 and a half hours to complete both. So, I've spent $80 on gel that is chipping and lifting after 2 days. The skin around my nails feels inflammed and is super dry and peeling. I was unhappy the last time I went. Should have lerned my lesson then.</Review>

The problem for me was that my nails came out very uneven and for the price I was very disappointed.  The shape that I showed him for my acrylic nails was not executed well at all.  I hoped for better. Unfortunately, I will not return and they are right up the street from my house :(.</review>< Pics>

I can only speak to pedicures here because that’s all I ever get, but everything was clean and good today. The lady doing my pedicure was nice and did a great job. I got the $28 spa pedicure and that included having my feet sit in some gel solution, the cheese grater on my rough spots, a leg massage and the massage chairs are a great treat too!
They are charging a $5 extra fee for COVID which they have signs posted on the door and the lady had me ready the notice too before she started my pedicure so there was no surprises there.
I would definitely come back here for another one!< /Review>

<Date>1599591196228< /Date><review>I went to Niki nails today 9/8. This is only the second time I’ve been. The first time I went over a year ago, terrible. Today, terrible. Nothing has changed.

My pedicure was outside which I know COVID guidelines however I paid regular spa pedicure prices for a pedicure that was done in a bowl. My pedicure was rushed as well. 48$ wasted.

Now for my nails, they’re terrible. They’re all shaped differently I asked for square. No where near square. Lengths don’t match. Just an all around terrible job. I was telling him what to fix and it only seemed to get worse.

While I was there there was an altercation, my nail tech was arguing with other nail techs and a  customer stormed out of the shop. My nail tech
Kept getting up and leaving yelling at the other workers. It was very unprofessional

I will never go back here.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>First time here and Last,  Firs $5 for COVID-19? Is that even legal?? I did read about the extra $5 and I was willing to pay to get all the procedures that were described in the regular pedicure. Hot towel ? They did not use a clean hot towel instead a towel laying in the table next to her. Don’t waste your time discussing because they will just act like they don’t understand what you are saying.

<rate>5<//rate><review>I walked in, no appointment and was welcomed into a very cute, chic salon. Hand sanitizer was readily available along with a sink and handsoap near the entrance. All employees were wearing masks and there was only 2 other guests in the salon at the same time. I went with a picture of what i wanted ( I got a full set, acrylics) and Niki took a quick look and handled her business! I was blown away, she did better than the picture I took in. I wasn't planning on it but I got a  pedicure too (by another lady at the salon). The slightest mistake (I didn't even catch it) and the women cleaned the product and re-did it. I also got a brazilian wax and Niki was very gentle and extremely thorough. All services was at a very fair price. All employees were super friendly. Its been 3 weeks and my acrylics are in perfect condition besides growing out. I don't even live in the area and I'm for sure going back for my fill because I know the service is QUALITY! Go check her salon out. You wont be disappointed.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc9d8963db02b7:0xbc12f85421b5649f<//GmapID></record>

Acrylics with gel polish. Absolutely love them, kinda have a tiny crush on my nails at now 🥰😊🥰
Pam did a great job, second time I had her, and I'll ask for her again. She is sweet and talks to me, she remembers things I said before, and remembers colors I have had before too.
I have had acrylics before, years ago, and recently (from a different girl here) and they were too "fat"! The shape and thickness is just perfect for me!! Thank you Pam!!!</Text>

Too expensive!  $83. for nail dip powder and basic pedicure.  The most painful pedicure I ever received!  I think she took all her Anger and Fustration out on my poor feet.<//Review>

I've also recently tried the dip manicure instead of gel. It lasted just over 2 weeks like stated by Kim. Great experience each time. I will continue to go back.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Be prepared to pay an additional $5.00 Covid19 fee on top of your total.  I did not see this disclosed any where in the salon or doors.  Pretty sneaky and for that I won't go back. They want the customers to recoop their losses for the last 3 months  that they had. Not good.<//review>

Go somewhere else. They also charge you a $5 covid fee after your service is done. Really bad experience, My acrylics look like a straight  shovel, not a rounded nail. The wait time was ridiculous too, a nail appointment at 4 wasn’t helped till 5!!!!! And of course they will tell you to come in!  They even lied to me on the phone!<//review>

I got a manicure and pedicure. Both were just okay. I do better myself with a 4-sided manicure board. If you go here bring cash or get charged an extra dollar credit card fee.</text>

I had my nails done on Sunday for new years. Not even 24 hours and my gel finish was peeling off 8 of my 10 nails. I went in on Tuesday to get it fixed. I'm told the guy that did them isn't there and I'll have to wait atleast an hour. (If they know this guy does this kind of work, why are they letting him work there???!!!)</text>

<review>Do not go here!!! First off they are clean. I sat and watch one women go from servicing one person to another with out changing her gloves. The women who did my nail did a horrible job. When I brought my concerns to her attention she acted like she couldn’t understand what I was saying. They over book all of their appointments so you will be waiting. After walking around for a few hours with these nails that I hate, I called and asked if they could just take the polish off so I can get it gone correctly elsewhere. Once I bought it up, I was hung up on and my number blocked<//review><name>Tierra Bowen</name><UserId.>116753824903943017570<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Pedicure was great. My acrylics already need a fill after a week of having them (they’ve needed a fill since 4 days after getting them)  don’t think
I’ll
Be coming back any time soon. Not only that, they’re slightly uneven and fatter in places.</text>

<Review>My first time here,  but my friend that was with me have been here before.  She agrees that they do a good job, but I just didn't expect an attitude from the lady when she felt that the tip wasn't sufficient enough.

<Review>I witnessed a customer get a manicure and leave I later saw her come back in and ask if she could get one more coat because when it dried it wasn’t as was expected, the man helping her was willing but then the actual lady who did her nails came up to them and was basically yelling at her telling her no and that it was the color. The whole store was staring I felt bad for the customer because she was actually very nice and was explaining why. Another reason I won’t come back is because my pedicure and manicure nail polish didn’t last more then a week and I got gel.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>Made an appointment a week in advance and still had to wait 45min. The lady didn’t even give me a chance to take off my wedding ring before she threw a glob of hand scrub all over it. I had to go have it cleaned after. The gel on my nails was EXTREMELY thick and all over my skin. And to top it off, I was overcharged and she gave attitude when I corrected her.< /Text>< Pics>

If I could give a no star I would. Got a pedicure a week ago. The guy idk his name cut my foot with the pumis stone. When I looked down I noticed it was a stone he has used on many people! So a pedicure that I paid 42 dollars for has cost me 25 at urgent Care and 25 for medication for infection. I don't know why these places just can't be regulated so people don't have to go through this. Would never go back< /Review>

I walked through the door and they informed me to come back later in 30 minutes. Not having much else to do and not wanting to drive the 10 minutes home just to drive 10 minutes back I stated I don't mind staying and waiting. The male manicurist turned to the girl he was working on and said "why she don't go home and cook. Her poor husband. Not my wife". I have never been more appalled in my entire life. Obviously I left and went somewhere else to get my nail fixed. The nerve of this nail salon to talk about their customers who are sitting 7-8 feet from them is absolutely incredible.

<Review>Customer service need improvement....when you're not spending top dollar, the service depreciates.  I left with burning cuticles from carelessness.  They rushed through my pedicure when they realized I wasn't spending more money on my nails. I don't feel good about leaving this review, but I am in hopes that they will read this and take care of every customer, with 100% professionalism no matter what price paid.< /Review><user>109810139381079361947< /user><resp>None</resp></record>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Do yourself a favor and don’t bother coming in. Customer service is terrible! The nails aren’t worth the price<//Text>

Absolutely one of the worst manicures I have received! I asked for glitter on my ring finger said they wouldn’t do it without putting a base coat of the color down first. You can also visibly see the brush strokes on my nails and bubbles the polish also doesn’t cover all of the nail but be assured it covers parts of my skin.  So end result is it looks like a 5 year old painted my nails.</Text>

<review>I go here all the time. Andrew is my fave nail guy and always does an amazing job. He finally talked me into gel polish after having bad experiences with gel and I'm sold. I've had it on for 3 1/2 weeks with no chips or anything and I'm super hard on my hands and nails. I don't really care for the pedicures as they are a bit overpriced for what they give you and it's not the greatest service for feet. But nails are awesome.< /review><Date>1504454826017< /Date><Rate>4<//Rate><pics>None</pics>< name>

<Text>Went in for a manicure and a pedicure decided to skip the mani after the girl who did my toes cut them down to nothing to where they were burning and literally cut open and bleeding when I tried to address multiple times that she was hurting me she acted as if she understood the universal word for ouch applies. When I told them I no longer wanted the manicure and wanted to speak with somebody about the severe hacking of my toenails they still charged me the full price for the pedicure and the extra dollar for using my debit card. They tried blaming it on a language barrier but like I said ouch is a universal word so is visual blood and cuts.< /Text>< pictures>

This is a newer nail salon in Menifee on Haun road/Newport rd  near Petsmart.
They do a great job here usually for all kinds of nails whether it be a manicure, acrylic nails, or something else. Good pedicures too.   They have the big massage chairs with the tubs down by your feet. Everyone is very friendly and the prices are reasonable, but they do get very crowded so you might find a wait, even with an appointment.< /text>

I went in for a full set acrylic, gel. 3 days later my polish starting peeling and cracking and there was a tom of air bubbles! I went in to get them fixed and they told me they were too busy to help me and the guy who did my nails would have to be the one to fix them and they didnt know when he would be in. So I paid $50 plus tip for my nails to not even last a full week!!! Never coming back.</review>

Horrible place, and bad customer service. They don’t even deserve the one star they are getting. They took advantage of my teenage niece by overpricing her for her nails with their ALREADY expensive prices. and not even doing a good job and being rude.

I went to this loction the day before yesterday to get a full set of acrylic nails, and first of all, the lady who did my nails was incredibly rude and impatient. When she applying them they were stinging underneath for some reason. Anyway TWO days after I left one of my ACRYLIC nails popped off!!!! That should not happen. I want my money back now. Do not go here if u would like good acrylics and service.<//text>

Horrible place when I went there with my mom today they said the wait was going to be 20 mins. We ended up waiting 45 mins, I ask the lady to warm up my water and the water got way colder. I also asked to get a design with 3 stripes on 1 nail and about 8 dots in my other finger. Then the lady asked the lady next to her about the designs and she said I can't get a design if I get a design it will be a flower with 3 dots. So I tell her I don't want a design then. The my mom got coffen shaped nails for $40 for a full set. My mom asked why is this $40 they said they charge $5 for shaped nails with a pedicure. When my mom and I were finished we go to the cashier and he said $25 for my manicure and $20 for my pedicure and he said $35 for my mom's manicure and $20 for my mom's pedicure then +$5 for the shape. The guy pulled out his caculater and adds all the numbers up and my mom spent $94 on 4 things. Horrible place me and my mom will never go here EVER again I rate this place a 1 star.< /Review>

<text>DISRESPECTFUL STAFF- My 93 year old mother was treated  very disrespectfully by manicurist. While she was kept waiting in water to do mani-pedi too long she had to use restroom and accidentally smudged her 2 nails after the girl was done . This manicurist actually scolded my Mother  in front of everyone in the shop for smudging a nail after being kept waiting in water for over an hour and half  !! This place is over priced and they charge a dollar service fee to swipe your card. This is so they can encourage people to pay cash and AVOID paying taxes!! = RIP OFF for tax purposes !!
I will never go there again!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I did a review 2 days ago about how I would love to give the girl who did my nails 5 stars and the one who did my toes 0.  I had to update that I came back to get a refund and I wanted to go somewhere else.  The refund is impossible and let me just say, I am sitting here getting them redone as the girl stares more at the TV than my toes. Come on people! If I didn't have an event I would stand up and leave.</review>

The first time I took my 15 year old in here to have her eye brows and nails done they burnt her face with the wax right before military ball. When I went right back in less than 5 min later they told me it wasn't them. Had the receipt to prove. No sorry no refund which I wasn't expecting but just wanted to bring to their attention the wax may have been too hot and to be careful. They did a good job on her nails so decided when it came time for a fill or new set we would go back. BIG MISTAKE! ! She went in today with her grandmother and myself.  When asked the price we were told $25. They charged her to remove old set (which only needed to be filled) charged for her color that was NOT gel and charged for the "coffin" or square shape. Non of which we asked for or agreed to. In the end she paid $43 not the $25 we had repetitively been told during our visit today. When questions ed the male manager basically told me she was stupid and that we were liars and refused to talk about it. She didn't want to continue to stay there so she paid for a service she was unhappy with. Lesson learned...we will go back to lake nails where they actually listen to their customers and don't charge for services not asked for< /text>

Second time at Niki Nails in the Marketplace off of Haun. The technicians are the rudest, most unfriendly women I have ever experienced. Judgemental, talk about you in their native language and joke and laugh about you. I will not make the mistake of going back a 3rd time!<//text>

Dont waste your money coming here, worst place to go, never going back there! I had been going there for almost a year and until today I felt I had been making a terrible mistake for going back and seeing Andrew for my nails. He was rude and through a fit infront of all the customers saying how he wasted his time doing my nails mind you I paid for my nails and waited for an hour to be seen. And it had not been the first time I  wait for him over an hour with an appointment scheduled.  As he said he will no longer take my appointments.
Overall the staff is very rude and unprofessional some girl techs come in wearing short dresses and see through shirt as if they are going to the club!!!!!    I will no longer come or recommend this place to ANYONE< /review>

< Review>
Sucky experience with my manicure, I wanted gel polish..grey and glitter..she didn't want to give me a light grey, the only color close to that was a lilac and I said no, so she put on a dark dark charcoal and it looks awful. Tried to go back in today (1/1/17) and they are closed and I'm leaving for a week tomorrow so I can't get it fixed..on top of the horrible color on one of my nails the paint is coming off like a bad press on. Super pissed!!!! Also the other lady messed up my French pedicure by carelessly putting the pink top coat over the white tips on SOME toes..rookie move!</Review>

I had a horrible experience they left my nails bulky, dirty, and with nail polish from before no matter how many times I corrected them, and even mocked me when I wanted something fixed, they painted a different color from what I chose and when I walked outside i hated the color more so walked back in for a color change and they tried to charge me $15 more dollars from an already $33 for just a fill! I walked out extremely disappointed and will never be going back!<//review>

<Text>Twice I've tried this place and twice my nails chipped way too quickly. Once I got a gel mani and chips started showing up only 2 days later, yesterday I got a regular pedi and I've already gotten a chip. Anywhere else  my salon pedis last months and my gel manis over 2 weeks.

Whoever did my mani yesterday was also very rushed and barely paid attention to the quality of my color. There were splotchy streaks and I had to instruct her to do another layer to make the color even. If I wanted a rushed uneven pedicure I can diy at home.<//Text>< response>

Overpriced. $70 for a fill with gel polish and a basic pedicure also with gel polish. Toes came out good. Still a little rough on the bottom but overall okay. Nails on the other hand. Horrible! The guy who did them was so rushed and wasn't even paying attention. He kept looking around and talking to other employees. Gel polish got on my cuticles and parts of my nails didn't even get any color. All for $70!! Ridiculous. I honestly feel like going back and asking them to repaint my nails. But they'll probably charge me for a new paint job. There goes another $20. Maybe I'll go somewhere else next time. 😔<//Review>

Guy wasn't paying attention to my feet. I had to ask him to fill the bowl with water. He was too quick. Said he put lotion and massaged my legs and he didn't. He insisted he did. Why would I say he didn't.<//Text>

<Text>My boyfriend and I stopped in after shopping around for gerd friendly products and were greeted quickly in a friendly manner. Not like the larger retail stores ,it made us feel like we were welcomed in and were asked what we were looking for we were assisted and  shown where products were located. The clerk even took the time to print information for us! Wow great service<//Text>< Pics>

I came into this shop today for some garbanzo bean flour. I dropped by here as I was in the area. Living west of the 99, I don't patronize this store often due to the drive. However, after today, I will make more of an effort to do so. I walked in and was immediately greeted by an employee and an older woman I presume was the owner. I told them exactly what I needed and they immediately checked their stock and showed me what they had. Unfortunately, the prices are a bit higher, which makes it difficult to buy everything here as I'm a student on a budget, but I understand this is due to them being organic and local. Definitely will be back whenever I am able to do so.</Text>

<text>I've called 3 times this morning for a scoby starter. Kristina told me to wait and call back 10 min each time. I gave her more than enough time to look and when I called back again and asked she gave me attitude and told me I could wait another 20min on hold and put me back on hold immediately in a very rude way. I will not be shopping here ever.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Around 10:30 0n Saturday I arrived at Christinas organic groceries. As I walked in the 2 lady’s worker turn their backs on me and started acting like they were doing some thing I guess they didn’t want to help me so I’m trying to find one of the lady’s. So I proceed to look for the lady with the glasses the one that always wears a long skirt and she starts up a conversation with somebody else so I wait until she’s done and then I asked her can you help me with something she really didn’t understand what I was looking for so she asked the lady with the short black hair and when she asked the lady that lady said nope and walked away I told her the store owner sold me a brand here.just point me in a direction and I could just read some of the stuff to find out what could help me best! And I asked her when would the owner be in she told me the day she went her way and I was there reading but I end up going to go look for some stuff that I needed and I asked her can I have some turmeric and she said are you going buy a pound I told her no I’m not and she didn’t want to help me she asked the guy that was Stocking the shelves to do it  I will never ever shop here again‼️6/20 (Very rude workers)</Text><time>1591471209747<//time><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This is a great place with a surprising number of specialty items that you can't find at other places like Sprouts and Trader Joe's.  However, despite the locality and good selection, I have to leave a poor review because the business insists on responding to each review (poor or otherwise) as you will notice when examining this page.  Responding to reviews is exceptionally bad form, and really does more harm than good for the store's reputation, (not to mention it makes potential reviewers a bit apprehensive).  The selection and service should speak for itself, and of course you cannot please every customer.  Without the rather unseemly online aspect, the store is five stars, no question.</review>

<Text>I want to like it but... the sales corner is nothing but expired product & the mark downs aren't even good. 50% off something that is 2 months expired? I don't think that's good practice. I asked what they do with expired food & they said they donate it. AFTER they can't sell it on markdown already expired... I get it's a small store & hard to turn over product but I don't want to accidentally buy expired food/drinks (which has happened here) or try a beauty product that is rotten & doesn't wash off (rosehip oil tester). I wish they advertised more so they could turn over product & get the foot traffic they need to become a community staple. A lot of potential but a swing & a miss. [I don't need a company reply - clean out your beauty testers instead]< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I try to do my part to keep local mom & pop businesses going, so when I moved to this area of town, I recalled that Kristina's was close by and I'd planned on patronizing this store more often even though their items tend to cost a bit more than other places offer them. I remember going to Kristina's with my mom when I was a kid and I used to shop there after taking my son to therapy at Fresno State since it's just down the street. Kristina's has definitely gone downhill. Way downhill.

I've been in Kristina's a hand full of times since moving back and there was almost always an elderly woman there who never looked happy to see me. This time around, she just stared at my visually impaired child's white cane instead of greeting us as we walked in. I asked to use the restroom and she pointed us to another employee who walked us to the back and pointed us to the restroom without a word. A sign said "no public restrooms", which I assumed meant that it was for employees and customers only. I was there to buy something, not use the restroom, but my little girls had to go. When we came out the elderly woman was standing outside the bathroom door waiting for us. Creep much? She told me that from now on when we shop there, we're to use the restrooms at the laundromat across the parking lot. I told her we don't shop there often anyway.

Thanks to her, from now on, we'll be shopping online or at Sprouts or Vitamin Shoppe. We get treated a thousand times better at these other stores and nobody follows us to the restroom and waits outside the door like a freaking creeper. You don't get to talk to me like the help and keep my business.

I'm sure it can't be easy for Kristina's to stay afloat with places like Sprouts, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Vitamin Shoppe to compete with, not to mention online health food stores and the fact that even big box stores like Walmart and Target now carry gluten-free and other specialty food items.

I'd suggest you guys ask rude elderly woman to retire if you want to keep your remaining customers. She's driving people away from the look of some of the other reviews here. You've already lost this customer.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1552060098352, 'text': "Grace,\nAs we replied to you in your duplicate review on Yelp, We at Kristina's are saddened to hear that you experienced unsatisfactory service with us.

<Text>I went in to order a homeopathic remedy Bryonia 30 c on May 21, 2019. Cynthia took my order and promised to call me in 2 days when it arrived. Never happened. I phoned 5 days later with zero results, answers or satisfaction.no return call.
Today June 5 I called again. While on hold to speak to Cynthia, they dropped my twice. On my third call they would not even pick up.
I sent them a message threatening to write a negative review, but they never called back.
So here is my negative review. How they stay in business with such poor customer relations is a true mystery to me. I have never been treated so poorly ever.

Kristina's has a higher price than my health food store in Florida, but they have generally cheaper prices than Whole Foods. (Clearance prices are insanely good and make it worth the trip.) The customer service is excellent and their staff is very knowledgeable.</Review>

They have the best tasting fruits here, like I live far but I will seriously go out of my way to come here and gather some of the fruits they have here. Sadly I'm to slow to the race and sometimes they're out of the fruit I will be looking for xD Other than that I love them.<//Review>

I asked a question regarding difference between steel cut oats and rolled oats and the young (Caucasian)
man said "he didn't know" and worse yet didn't try to find out!!  Product
knowledge in a store like this is crucial.< /Review>

Find it interesting that the person ordering and maintaining vitamin stock doesn't know the products.
Item I requested was out of stock.  Received a call from the young lady in charge telling me they don't carry such an item. An item I have purchases many times before.  When I tried to get it thru to her she accused me of yelling at her.  I never yelled.
Finally I was able to talk to another person and spelled out "Ferro Food" and someone from the store had called me.  The gentleman stated the item was in and I then drove from 3 miles east of Clovis.
The item was being held at the counter.  The staff member who handled the transaction was kind and apologetic.< /text>

<Review>Turkey sandwich was pretty good, however the dutch crunch lacked crunchiness. Time on a Friday for getting a sandwich was pretty ridiculous probably 25+ minutes. They need more people working to get things out the door sooner.</Review><Time>1617931291607</Time><UserId.>100238303310243872465</UserId.><Rating>4<//Rating>< gmapID>

The sandwiches are fantastic and very filling. But I have to say, they run out bread way too often, hours are very small, and the wait times can be a little ridiculous at times. I never go here in a rush, but I feel bad for the people who try and get a sandwich from here on a short lunch.< /text>

<review>I’ve loved Lorenzo’s since I lived a block away back in 2006.  Not sure if it was the end of the day kitchen running out bad luck but my sandwich yesterday was pretty sad.  Barely any turkey or garlic sauce (which is my favorite) and missing lettuce.  Usually I can only eat half and save half for later.  I ate the entire thing and could have ate a second if I had one.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-n3i8iNblYV2sDlnznqf4-7aSOmSrPwLV5-8O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Good local sandwich spot.

However, Just kinda odd with how they take their orders via phone. Plus seems that they dont have call waiting function that you have to keep dialing until your call gets through due to busy tone during peak times. Didn't really u understand how we were told to to come in an hour to pick up our order, so our  toasted sandwiches were already soggy.

But the kids still approved and said "It was good and I would recommend the turkey bacon cheese on soft bread."

Will try again in the future with friends who might know some type of special local trick...we'll see< /text>

<Text>This little sandwich shop is truly great, authentic old school style. All orders to go and food is amazing. They've been a local fixture for a long time , quality and freshness are good. Service and staff phenomenal. Must try if in the area, worth the trip if passing thru Belmont. Pastrami is awesome and other sandwiches are the bomb.</Text>< Pictures>

Edit 8/7/19

Went here again and got the turkey with extra meat. Sooo much meat, it was delicious but I probably will just get a normal sandwich next time. There was a lady here that came from San Jose to get 8 sandwiches FOR HERSELF because she loves this place so much. Do yourself a favour and check it out. Get the garlic sauce. Win.< /text>< user_id>

Been coming here for over ten years. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich I've tasted. The egg salad is also good. Veggies always taste fresh and crisp. And the pesto dressing is the only one I've seen and it's heavenly good. No seats. Only to go order.</text>

Been coming here for over 20 years.  Absolutely the best sandwich shop in the area.   Whether you're picky or like everything possible they can handle it.  Their breads taste better.   Their toppings seem more fresh and their meats are top notch.   Just wish they were not busy when I arrive.</text>

Good food for a decent price. Unlike some other places in the county, I can eat the whole sandwich without feeling like I'm about to explode. Parking can get challenging if you need to park close by. There isn't seating here either, so all food is to go.<//review>

<review>Local favorite.  Consider calling your order in ahead of time during the lunch rush, as the line can get pretty long, which is a testament to the enduring popularity of this place.  Used to only take cash, now accepting card as well.<//review><user_id>106425402105866821150<//user_id>< Pictures>

Solid sandwich offerings priced appropriately and they crank 'em out pretty quickly. No fifth star though because The Greedy Ant down the road is by far the best sandwich spot in the area.<//Review>

Great sandwiches. Be prepared to wait as it is a popular place. Take out only.

Microwave bacon is the downside.</Text>

Regardless of whether or not their sandwich is any good, in my opinion it's not worth going here because of their unpleasant, tense and snippy attitude.<//Text>

One of the owners is RUDE. I guess the saying unhappy people have unhappy lives, is true in this situation.< /review>

My son used to work here unless sandwiches were awesome I went there a couple months ago because I had a doctor's appointment in the area and I had to throw my sandwich away it was full of oil everywhere on the outside of the bread and it was so machine gross really sad because I was really craving it there sandwiches have always been wonderful in the past not quite sure what happened this time but I was really disappointed.< /review>

Have been ordering online and it's delicious every time. I love all the options, and I don't feel too judged about coming up with something weird.10 stars. Jackie and Jake are awesome.</Review>

Our lunch was amazing!! I got the BBQ Bacon Burger with fries and a peppermint latte both made exactly how I wanted it and my friend got the waffles and a pumpkin spice latte. The staff was awesome like always and Josh,the manager, is the best.</review>

I had heard good things about this place so I thought I would try it. Unfortunately, the chicken on my sandwich was tough (I think undercooked), the side dishes I was given was incorrect so my sandwich sat there getting cold and with people reaching over it while they got my correct side dish ready. Which took a bit because they ran out. The street corn, which I thought would be hot, was right out of the fridge cold. I guess this just wasn't the place for me.</review>

<review>This chain is easily one of the top 3 places you have to go when you visit Redding! The pastries are divine and they're made in house. The french fries are beer-battered. The shakes and Frappuccino like drinks are always really exotic flavors like lavender or white chocolate with oranges and lemons. Very creative, hearty food. And the staff always make my heart Happy! This place is a legit five star gem!<//review><time>1566029648342<//time></record></dataset><record>

Typically they are really good, but don't go between 12-2. They were slammed my blt looked like the ingredients were thrown together from 3ft away.</text>

The food is great, the only reason I'm not doing higher stars is online ordering is very primitive. And if you try to order over the phone its impossible to get a person. With food allergy theres not really a way to customize when you order online and I know adding ingredients cost extra but there is no way to add and pay the extra. Otherwise the service is good and if you do get a Togo order they are typically prompt!< /Review>

<review>The taste is fairly good however I never found a restaurant that say no so much to a customer. Not even small things that are advertised on their menu they actually honored. Like once I ordered an spaghetti dish and as per the menu says you could select between tortillas or plantain and they told me I couldn't get plantain, after I asked them to include it even at extra cost they agree to it and yet I had to basically beg to get it boiled instead of fried..< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>De catrachos solo tienen el nombre. Avoid this place if you’re in a rush, or very hungry. I was looking forward to eat here, because a friend recommended it, but I regret it. It is overpriced, I ordered two baleadas and they took 47 minutes to have my order ready. Y la baleada mía a duras penas tenía frijoles, ni mantequilla (crema) me le pusieron. I came to visit from another state, and was disappointed. Not coming again. Lo único que me gustó fue el chicharrón que le pusieron a la baluca.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Absolutely the best kabob place near La Crescenta La Canada. There are a few places that do kabob around here but this place is simply the best. Would definitely recommend. Usually get the chicken kabob plate.< /Review>< pics>

Fast forward to 40 minutes still no food on our table and no update. Finally after almost an hour our food arrived. I had to ask for refills on both coffee and water. Service could be better but food is flavorful. The service staff and kitchen staff need training in order for this restaurant to receive better feedback. Also, take out customers were complaining that they waited over and hour; many customers left because of the long wait.

Awesome food. Love the fruit drinks. Food can take its time but once it hits the table you will be provided with a very homemade delicious dish. Service is friendly. Yovani is a very helpful person.<//Text>

Even thought the area looked sketchy because we're from northern California. Right away we had a great experience one of the staff members moved his car so we could park.  the place was very clean and seem very safe inside. People were nice at all times. Good was great and that's a plus. In conclusion, beautiful gem hidden in some place in LA.</Text>

Good and delicious food, but time to wait to be served it's way more than 30min and more than once waiter forgets orders and rarely comebacks to the table to ask or see if you need anything else.

But if you got time to waist on waiting for food and finding parking it's worth it cause food its delicious but I prefer to go where it's more efficient as a 1st option and that's where my business go

Family okay

Esperamos casi 45 minutos por la comida. We waited about 45 minutes for our food. The parking is terrible. No hay parqueo ni madres. Wasn't too crazy about the flavor. Le hiso falta sazon.</Review>

if I could give this place 0 stars I would. It shouldn’t take almost 2 hours to bring food to the table. This is ridiculous for my first time here and it’s for sure going to be the last.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Today I went to eat and literally how terrible the food is, I asked for a mojarra that looked like tasteless rubbery tasteless is not critical but that mojarra tasted like earth, the slices were not crunchy, they were ahuadas, the banana was ripe, we bought a cutlet, it seems that it was. overheated

El día de hoy fui a comer y literalmente que pésima esta la comida pedí una mojarra que parecía hule insípida sin sabor no es crítica pero esa mojarra sabía a tierra las tajadas no eras crujientes estaban ahuadas el guineo estaba maduro compramos una chuleta igual parece que era recalentada<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) What can I say about Sason K-tracho: The food is very good, good taste BUT the service is very lousy, the waitresses serve reluctantly, they have turtle service and to pay with a card they finish you off with an additional charge that not even the neighbors from 9.99 they still do not buy 5 dollars.

(Original)
Que puedo decir del Sason K-tracho: Muy buena la comida, buen sabor PERO en el servicio es muy pésimo, las meseras atienden de mala gana, tienen servicio de tortuga y para pagar con tarjeta te rematan con un cobro adicional que ni los vecinos del 9.99 no lo hacen aún comprando 5 dolares.</Review>< Rate>

<review>(Translated by Google) APPALLING!!! Chicken SOUP that looks like sick soup. I only brought those vegetables, and a dry and salty chicken 👎 apart we bought other meals. Some enchiladas that tasted like reused and burned butter, and tasteless ground beef🤢 left us disgusted

(Original)
PÉSIMO!!! SOPA de pollo que parece sopa de enfermo. Solo traía esos vegetales, y un pollo seco y salado 👎 aparte compramos otras comidas. Unas enchiladas que sabían a manteca reahusada y quemadas, y la carne molida sin sabor🤢 nos dejó con asco</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<text>(Translated by Google) I did not like it, it took a long time for the food to come and it must be why the lady from Alado left and told him that they were late and there is no parking

(Translated by Google) The place is nice and cozy, its employees are very attentive, but its cuisine is horrible, I am a catracho and I am sorry to say that they cannot represent a catracha kitchen as it should be.
As a diner I am disappointed with this place the only two stars I leave is for its hospitality and cozy place, but to be a restaurant they must care more about improving their food

(Original)
El lugar es agradable y acogedor sus empleados muy atentos, pero su cocina es espantosa soy catracho y me da pena de decir que no pueden representar una cocina catracha como debe ser.

(Translated by Google) It is one of my favorite restaurants in what is the Honduran gastronomy for me the # 1 as the seasoning catracho there is not very good attention very friendly girls all very clean and hygienic very rich all the food and very good prices I recommend them alive A little removed from where they are located but when I want a HONDURAN craving I go to where it is because as there are no others so go and try and I promise you they will not regret it and they will return again and again and again and they will not care distance

(Translated by Google) The food is good, but the bad that they charge more than one of what is said on the menu, I ordered a chicken broth that desia on the menu $ 14.99 and wing of the receipt come out with other prices, very bad from them , like the prices of the other meals, they charge you more

(Original)
La comida está buena , pero lo malo que le cobran más a uno de lo que díse en el menú,  yo pedí un caldo de gallina que desia en el menú $14.99 y ala hora del recibo salen con otros precios , muy malo de parte de ellos , al igual que los precios de las otras comidas , te cobran de más</Review>

Everything was very good until the lady cheated us IF she steal us unfortunately, I do not care about the money if she does not want to see the fool's face ... I ordered a soup of mondogo and chicken, in the menu said 14.99, when I reached the cashier to pay and I asked him for the bill, he gave me only the total almost $ 100. Asked; Can you give me the invoice with prices please? And she replied that she has to wait for us to do it, we exchanged the payment card, trusting that everything would be fine and maybe I would be wrong, I charge almost 100 and she always says she wants the invoice ???? I was waiting for the bill I charged almost 17 soups and 5 baliada sodas to 3 ... Osea I was well ugly and did not want to give me the bill I had to wait to see other prices completely different menu ... Finally I left without saying anything because I felt more sorry for ME. I will never go back and my sister was her second time but she will never come back ... Those things keep the client away.

Quiero compartir lo que me paso, vine desde muy lejos (otro estado) por comer la comidita rica de Honduras que desde hace mas de 4 años no comia la sopita de mondongo y Las baleadas. Todo estaba muy bien hasta que la señora nos estafo SI NOS ROBO lamentablemente, no me preocupa el dinero si no que nos quiera ver la cara de tontos... Yo pedi una sopa de mondogo y de pollo, en el menu decia 14.99 , cuando llegue a caja a pagar y le pedi la factura me dio solo el total casi $100 me asombre!! Le pregunte; me puede dar la factura con precios por favor?  Y ella respondio se tiene que  esperar a que la haga intercambiamos la tarjrta de pago confiando en que toda iba estar bien y talves yo estaria equivocada, me cobro los casi 100 y me dice siempre quiere la factura???? Osea yo estaba esperando la factura me cobro casi a 17 las sopas y 5 cada baliada los refrescos a 3 ... Osea me estafo bien feo y no queria darme la factura tuve que esperar para ver otros precios totalmente diferentes al menu... Finalmente me fui sin decir nada porque me dio mas pena a MI. Nunca volvere y mi hermana era su segunda ves pero nunca volvera... Esas cosas alejan al cliente.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

(Translated by Google) The food is very rich and tasty, the only bad thing is that if you are in a hurry to eat it is not recommended here, they take a long time preparing the food, I arrived and I asked for only 6 shots, it took an hour, I was about to leave .

(Original)
Muy rica y sabrosa la comida, lo único malo es que si vas con prisa a comer no es recomendable aquí, se toman un gran tiempo en preparar la comida, llegue y pedí nada más 6 baleadas, se tardaron una hora, ya estaba por irme.< /review>
