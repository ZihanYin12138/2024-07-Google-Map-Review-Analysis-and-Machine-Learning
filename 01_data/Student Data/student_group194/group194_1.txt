<Text>My first time there and I loved it. I went in to get a sandwich from the deli and instead I bought chicken fingers, ceviche and a couple of other things. They have so much to choose from. I definitely will be back.</Text>< pics>

Now the prices are outrageous and the small-town vibe is gone. If you have any other option I would recommend going elsewhere.< /text>< pics>

<Review>The employees are always very helpful and the store is what you might expect, being the only grocery store really, prices are a bit high, but cheaper than driving further for a sale, and they have a wide variety of things to choose from.<//Review>< user_id>

There are only two reasons you will shop here. 1. You live around here and and want to drive down the mountain for food. Or 2. You're camping up here and forgot to buy an item or two.
They have a deli with hot food but the cooked tri Tip has been under cooked 2/2 times so beware.
They have a decent alcohol and produce sections and decent overall selection.
The prices however are higher than Fresno, as expected.< /Text>

I noticed that other than a hard to notice sign on a blackboard outside the entrance about social distancing, there was a total lack of masks on customers and the social distancing stickers that had been on the floor for social distancing had been removed.  The whole experience made me very uncomfortable.  In contrast, I shopped in Fresno last Thursday and every one of the stores I went in required a mask and social distancing.  The stores were:  UPS at 1st & Nees, Savemart on Nees, Lowes on Blackstone, Vons on Cedar and Siong’s fruit stand on Willow.

Great small town grocery store. They have everything you need and the prices are not outrageous. They make amazingly delicious sandwiches and soup.  There is also an absolutely wonderful deli case with homemade salads and fresh cold cuts and cheese. They have a nice hot food counter with great fried chicken, Jojo potatoes,    fried burritos and more. They also have a fantastic beer, wine and liquor department It's a wonderful stop on your way to Shaver Lake.<//text>

The store is very clean and the employees are super nice and helpful. Prices are a little steep, but not too bad for not having to go to town.< /text>

Good food. Prices aren't bad, considering it is a mountain store. Quality was good. The veggies I buy are maybe even sometimes a little better than in town. Very pleased with Marval.</review>

<text>I like this store and come here a lot but today when I came it to grab a sandwich I couldn't believe how inconsiderate the lady's behind the sandwich area were. I stood there for at least 5 min and they simply ignored me and this is the second time this has happened. If your going to have a sandwich area at least acknowledge people when they walk up and let them know if your busy!!!! I will stick with subway.<//text><Name>Brad Williams<//Name>< gmapID>

Prices are quite high. We try to do our shopping in the valley and use marval as a convenience store. For that purpose, the prices are acceptable. The store is clean and well lit and the employees are freindly.< /review>

Nice clean store, I wish there were more local produce and meat.  The stuff from Mexico is less to be desired.

I can always find what I need there.< /text>

On the weekends they barbeque the best tri-tip. You can buy it whole or buy the most delicious tri-tip sandwich on a fresh roll you ever had!! Don't forget to check out the produce section it might be small but it has fresh everything!!

Not only is there food here, but it's an enjoyable experience. They have Ready-to-Eat food, they have a great meat department and they have many unusual items in the store.</text>

< review>
Dropped in for lunch to go at their deli for a tri-tip sandwich. My selected ingredient choices of sriracha cheese bread, along with pepper jack, BBQ sauce, toasted, & all veggies (except olives) really hit the spot!  They also have skewered orange or BBQ chicken.  Friendly staff, I will be back.<//review>

< Review>
Store is clean, food is always fresh, staff is very nice and helpful. Cost more than shopping in Fresno but you have to expect that seeing as you are not having to drive 30 minutes to an hour to get it from Fresno.</Review>

<Date>1621379332151</Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Cart was ok, but people at counter and overall how the business was run is questionable at best.  They clock you when you pay, then you wait in line to get a cart then they clock you after you wait in line to return the cart.  We were 5 minutes over ( all due to waiting in line) and they charge you extra for "being over the two hour limit".  Plus the people at the counter obviously don't care about customer service.  Just rude and emotionless.  One of the worst customer experiences I've ever had.  It's sad because it's such a beautiful place.  I would recommend going to the other cart rental if you have the option.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Great service but highly recommended to have a reservation instead of just showing up and standing in the long line.  90 dollars for two hours seemed fair and we had a wonderful time driving around on our own schedule.  It was a bit tricky to drive the car due to its auto start feature, but I got the hang of it fairly quickly.  No better way the quickly see what the island had to offer.< /review>< pictures>

One of their workers (~40 yo male, extremely overweight with glasses) was very rude to us for no reason (we rented from the other place and he was a jerk to us while we were out on the road - I think he was trying to ruin our day and make it seem like he was a worker from the other company that we did rent from?). So strange. Take your business elsewhere!< /review>

<Text>Sandra did not handle my situation with any understanding or professionalism
I did my due diligence as a customer to ask Sarah if I had to go over would it be a problem due to the fact my brother was proposing at the IEX at 2:45pm, she said they're pretty flexible, just call ahead and I'm sure they'll be ok with it. I called around 2, spoke with Jessica to find out if it wouldnt be an issue and she said I could keep until 4:10pm, never informed this would be an additional $50. I would have happily brought it back if either of them had explained properly that I would be forfeiting my deposit, as it was just sitting there during my brothers proposal. I felt that this was completely unfair and not explained at all, so to show up to be told I would get nothing back was unfair and theft. Keep this in mind when handing them cash they'll just hold it hostage or steal it, make sure you understand all the rules and ask all the questions because they sure as hell don't know how to communicate properly.

I'll be getting my money back another way, they'd rather have negative reviews and impact their business, then pay back deposits. Take your business elsewhere, These guys need to be shutdown.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Absolutely horrible. They “got a random call” that was recklessly driving and they had no evidence, no proof, I was NOT speeding on a slow cart that goes 10mph. It was absolutely ridiculous. I was singled out for nothing and I am not happy. Take your business elsewhere.<//text>< pics>

Apparently an 18 year old can go and die for this country, but can’t even ride a golf cart for 20 mins? Absolutely pathetic rules. And the lady at the front office was a witch to say the least. Can’t miss her either, short, Hispanic, blacked out glasses, and utterly rude. Wouldn’t buy a golf cart from here again!<//Text>

I am visiting Avalon for 2 weeks, and on Monday (June 24, 2019) I rented a golf cart here. It was quite busy, but I didn’t mind. The guy who introduced me to the controls on the golf cart was extremely kind and patient. I recommend this place to anyone who is reading this. I absolutely love it. I will definitely come again during my visit.<//text>

<Text>Closes at their own whims! Wanted to do the 1-hour tour. They were already closed by 3:45pm while the website says 5pm. Lady on the phone says last rental at 4pm. (This is exactly what we would expect so we were going to do the tour from 3:45-4:45. Have the cart back by 5pm.)< /Text>< user_name>

Why walk when you can ride a golf cart. It is really helpful to rent a golf cart to see the main points of Catalina Island. I was only in Catalina Island for the day and the golf cart saves time to be able to do other activities. You can see all the main points via the route they recommend in one hour. However, it is better to rent it for the full 2 hours in case you want to see the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens.

The price for 2 hours is $90.00 and there is a $45 cash (only) deposit fee. You get the deposit back once the cart is returned. The driver who gave me the golf cart was friendly to show how to operate it. My recommendation is to make sure to reserve a time frame online. The golf carts sell out quickly when you arrive to the island. The company provides a map that shows the streets and route to take to get the best views.< /Review>

I wouldn't rent a cart from here again. It's is too expensive for what you get. I can see if it was $45 for 3 hours, but not one hour. You have to rush around and can't really enjoy your time. Plus, you have to deposit full cash, and use a credit card, before renting. It felt super strict and harsh and not a good start to using the service. When you return the cart on time, you get your cash back and then they charge your card. It is a strange policy. I promised my niece, who is 19, that she could ride the cart, but learned that you need to be at least 25. It's ridiculous. I guess those are the rules, but they are a bit silly. It was nice not to have to walk around, but it could be arranged better with friendlier customer service.< /review>

Staff was friendly and helpful. We were going to rent for 3 hours but they recommended just getting it for an hour and we had it for another hour and they just kept our deposit. We were there before a cruise ship arrived. It was hectic when we returned the cart, but the staff was again very courteous. Price was about the same all over the island.</Review>

<text>Staff was friendly and provided great info about the roads and operation of the carts. It may seem pricey but once you get out and see the hills and veiw points than it all makes sense. We had a group of 4 and had the best time exploring the mountain roads above Avalon. I would recommend this experience to everyone especially if you only have a day to explore. *See photos<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Aside the breezy freedom in driving an easy-going golf cart to the heights of Avalon, I'd add a big Thank You for the owner of Cartopia. This business gave an "extra" half-hour cart time for military Veterans, also we were pleasantly shocked! Likewise, special thanks must go to dependable cart 64, and to Avalon for some very cool views. Thanks!!!

Not only they charge $45 to $65 an hour, you can rent a compact car for 24 hours for that kind of price. Wow!! Rip off galore. Unreal and nasty people. The person that shows you the cart, is just rude. Tells you this is the gas pedal and this this is the stop pedal, no other information on the cart. Then you have to be back in 2 hours!! Really?? Why? Why can we rent it for 3 or 4 hiurs? Why do we have to drive all the way back just to re-tenting it again! Waste of time. I don’t recommend this place.

<Review>I have never posted a review on any forum until this incident. Here it goes!
Picking up the cart was seamless, the gentleman that processed everything was great. His initials were JM I believe, very nice guy. The return was unbelievable.
We pulled the cart back around in line with all the others. I saw the door open on the back side were we were parked. I assumed that was where to go for the return. I walked in there was 2 guys behind counter, one towards the front, shorter guy and one at the main counter, taller guy. I stopped at he main counter which is about 10 feet long. I said I was returning a cart. The tall guy walked over to where the other guy was in front and grabbed a sign and put it in my face saying the returns were down here. Mind you this is 10 foot counter and he just took a few steps to get the sign to shove it in my face. I was shocked that an employee would act in such a manner. Put a sign in a guest face and say returns are down here, 10 feet away on the same counter. After being made a fool of, all they needed was an initial on the form. I signed and walked away really annoyed. What was that all about? I was really left with a bad impression and wondered if there was any kind of supervision there.  Did the tall guy think it was ok to be a jerk. Guest recovery from managers Sandra and Conrad was lame!<//Review><rating>1< /rating>< date>

Extremely poor service by Jose during check-in.  Yes, it was very busy but there is no reason to be rude to your customers.   Watch out for going over your time limit (even 1 min will landing you a full hour over charge ! , that's how they make their margins)<//text>

Came to Catalina for the day. Assuming the golf rentals would be open at 3PM, because hours say closing at 5:00PM. So I came up to front desk to rent, and they said they closing early because it’s not as busy of a day today. SMH! I’m stuck on a island all day because none of the rentals stay open till the time it says on Google!<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) In February, There was only choice of riding a golf cart because the weather was cold and there was not much to do with my daughters. 4 person cart pays $ 45 per hour, For 6 person, it costs $ 65, but the same amount must be deposited by cash. The deposit will be returned when the cart is returned. You must bring your driver's license and driving a cart was not difficult, but brakes and accelerator pedals must be deeply handled. It took about an hour to go around a given course and there was plenty of time to take pictures from the top.

Catalina, who came in February, rode a golf cart because the weather was cold and there was not much to do with young children. Four-person is $ 45 per hour, six-person is $ 65 and can be paid by card, but the same amount of deposit must be paid in cash. The deposit will be returned when the cart is returned. You must bring your driver's license and drive the card is not difficult, but brakes and accelerator pedals must be deep. It takes about an hour to go around a given course, and there is plenty of room to take pictures from the top.

2월에 온 카탈리나는 날씨가 춥고 어린 아이들과 할 수 있는 활동이 별로 없어 골프카트를 탔습니다. 4인용은 1시간 $45 이고, 6인용은 $65 이며 카드 결재 가능하나 동일한 금액의 보증금을 현금으로 내야 합니다. 보증금은 카트 반납하면 돌려줍니다. 운전면허증을 지참해야 하고 카드 운전은 어렵지 않으나 브레이크와 가속페달은 깊게 밟아야 합니다. 정해진 코스 한 바퀴 도는데 1시간 정도 걸리고 정상에서 사진 정도 찍을 수 있는 여유는 있습니다.< /review>< user>

Great Neighborhood Grocery that has been here since before my childhood! Quality service and meat when you get the proper butcher’s! Try to the avoid the older short butcher with white hair and a mustache he tends to be the only one who gives terrible service and trash meat. He tries to sell of the meat that’s about to go bad or already is.... other than that great establishment<//review>

Small ethnic grocery, fine for quick local pick-ups. Passable produce. Don't miss the butcher section in back - I'm especially fond of the fresh Mexican cheeses. Inexpensive, relatively.<//review>

We stayed close to this Market, and went in to see what was good.
We became regular costumers to their fruit which was super cheap and the best fruit we've ever had.
Besides that there are a good selection of many different goods to a reasonable price.
And the ATM fee is lower than the standard. Viva Mexico<//review>

Great local store. The only major problem that I continue to have is VERY poor quality customer service in the meat department! Although I continued to go back because it's near by and has everything I look for, I can't continue to allow the lady in the meat department to be rude to people including myself. On several occasions I've seen her toss the orders to customers and is very rude to people with language barriers. Sadly she looks Hispanic herself. This issued has been addressed with manager, but she continues to treat customers so rudely!!! I will definitely NO longer return due to her disrespectful and rude behavior!</review>

So far this public storage facility has met beyond my expectations! Ashley Helped me answer all my concerns, helped me pick the right unit for the amount of stuff I have, all while wearing a mask for each other’s protection. I couldn’t see it, but I’m sure she had a friendly smile that went with the friendly service. Thanks again Ashley!</Review>

Paz was just a delight I came in with my Boyfriend to make a payment on our storage bill and he was just exceptional. He asked if we had done a review for the property when we said we have not he very politely asked if we would do one for him if we have had a pleasurable experience with the company. I was not the happiest when our rent was raised last year but other then that our experience with public storage has been phenomenal.< /Review>

Ashley was very helpful. I have recently moved my stuff to this storage facility since they got a new manager at the other public storage on cedar where I had my items. The service here was good, the manager had a good personality and was friendly. The location is good, though slightly hidden.  I would recommend this place to others who like a safe, quiet, clean place to keep their stuff.< /review>

<Review>Morell went over and beyond to help me today. When the manager was no help she called and emailed the district manager to help me get taken care of. This was her first time at this location and tried everything she could think of to try and help me with my problem.  Some people would have been like oh well this is not my location come back when a normal pwrson is here. Thank you so very much for all your help Morell!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Nasira was very helpful. I have recently moved all my stuff to this storage facility and the service here was great! The manager had a good personality and was friendly.

Had a fabulous experience as my onsite client services representative Noah in the Enterprise St / Fremont, CA field location processed my contract documentation quickly and was able to thoroughly explain the terms I was responsible for during the rental term agreement.  A++ service!

I rented a 5x5 space since 2012. The price was raised from $53 to $83 per month now which is unreasonable. On top of that, I was called to change a better lock. I showed a new lock to a lady at the office. She put a public storage sticker on new lock and told me Ok to use it . After a couple months, I was been called with same problem. This time the lock I used was cut off by the office stuff and put their locks on. When I had sometime to go and check in at the unit , I found out  my belongings were missing.</text>

<Review>I looked around and visted many different storage facility's including different PS locations and found the customer service here to be exceptional and outstanding, the young associate named Daniella was very helpful and was a determining factor in me getting a unit at this location, the property was very clean and upkept and the units themselves were very decent, I've recommended this location to many family and friends<//Review><user_name>RedWolf Gaming<//user_name>< user>

I had never felt the need for a storage unit until recently.  I am a full time Realtor who offers complimentary staging on my smaller sized homes that I list.  Last year, I had so many listings, that when it came time to de-stage them, my husband started to glare at me as our garage and home started to fill up.  Solution...Public Storage.  I looked at several storage facilities and selected this one due to it's central location ( I serve silicon valley, penninsula, and 680 corridor homes), cleanliness, safety of location, and prices.  I reserved a unit online.  When I got to the location, Ashley, the onsite manager, was very helpful in explaining the process and terms.  My first two weeks, I locked my units gate latch in the open position.  Ashley called me within a half an hour to let me know.  Every time I go to the facility, Ashley always greets me with a smile and a wave as I drive through the gate.  The whole experience is hassle free and it helps that Ashley is helpful and friendly, versus the creepy an condescending attitudes I expereinced elsewhere while shopping.  A great value and a great service in a safe, clean and central location.<//Review>

< Review>
rented here a few months back the manager ashley was very helpfull  in getting  me set up with  the rite  size unit and all the packing supplies i needed. She was a life saver!!! property is always very clean and kept up they also have a restroom  avalible too which is nice. I would highly recomend this facility especially since they actually care about their customers not too many places do these days Ashley is GREAT tho<//Review>

They have a lot of open pool tables available and it's still busy they take the right appropriate actions for covid-19 and they play the best music there you can also download an app to play whatever music you want from the Jukebox it's cool. It's so easy to have a great time! I'll definitely be going back and referring people here hope this review helps if you're considering looking for a good place to hang out at.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>The billiard halls in Sacramento have been around for a long time. Sharkeys was one of those places that was known as a shady hang out back in the 90s.

Nowadays it's a different clientele, different music, different management.  Gone are the bad crowds that used to frequent this place.

It would be nice if they updated the ambiance, arcade and the building itself, but it's still a good enough pool hall to go play a couple racks. .<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

A nice place to hang out after a long week. I went there with a friend and we enjoyed a good couple of games for the time we were there. Price wasn't too bad and I would definitely go again. Plus, its right next to a Krispy Kreme!< /Review>

Consistently an incredible experience -- both in the restaurant and at home. I absolutely love Thai food and have had the best in Thailand as well as the worst at some restaurants in the states. I absolutely love Farmhouse's drunken noodles, pad Thai, Tom kha, samosas, and red curry. All delicious as a vegetarian!</review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>LOL. okay first off all people are reviewing this place poorly because they don't like how their NON-THAI food tastes xD seriously people??

I feel like I am a pretty harsh Thai food critic since I love cooking Thai food and honestly? I was pretty blown away by their Pad Thai. Reminds me of all the Pad Thais I had back in Thailand. I like to judge Thai restaurants on a few basic dishes and this dish here definitely won me over. My friend ordered the Thai fried rice, and yes that one was pretty darn delicious as well. The pork actually tasted fresh compared to some of the other Thai places in Thai Town. (What is it with these restaurants with amazing flavoring of dishes, yet ruined by the poor meat quality?!)

Would definitely swing by when I am in the area again!</review>< Pictures>

Absolutely phenomenal food from beginning to end, and the ambience and decor makes this restaurant a singular destination.We loved everything we tried, really delicious dishes with uniquely beautiful presentations.Mieng Kum Kung - crispy crusted Tiger Prawns, leafy green wrapped with a zesty mixtureof lime, ginger, onion, roasted coconut & peanuts, tamarind reduction - BOMB.< /review>

Very good Thai food. We got our food really fast(although it wasn't busy). The only thing I didn't like was the portion of rice given. We asked for more and got some but would of been nice not having to ask. Strong Thai iced tea :)<//Text>

< Review>
Me and my wife had been planning to visit Pimai and try the food there but never got a chanve and since we are moving away from Hollywood we made it a point to visit some places before we do so. And we really regret not visiting here. Food here is delicious, everything we tried was fantastic and we really loved the way they served Tom yum soup on a small burner to keep the soup hot. Dimsums were great and Grilled Salmon too. The only thing that I felt was ridiculously expensive were the fress coconuts $5.5 each I mean we ordered so many things and those coconuts were like 25%of the whole check.< /Review>

This place was awesome because the service, atmosphere, and (most importantly) food, was awesomely delicious. I would definitely come here again. Tasty clear soup in the lunch special, and yummy pad see ew noodles, with delicious steamed dumplings as an appetizer. Totally would recommend.< /text>

Pimai is a fun experience. The food is good, and not very expensive. The environment is small, which is a plus. The one downside to the small space is when it gets full it can be fairly loud (I like more quiet dinning experiences). Other than that, it's a great place, I'd recommend it to anyone nearby.</review>

<Review>Ive only had take out from Pimai a few times,  I live close by so by the time I get home it is still quite hot.

The food has been consistently good. Everything Ive gotten has needed a bit of hot sauce to liven it up.  The food is good, just a little bland for my tastes.  Ive tried several different dishes  and had the same judgement.</Review>< Pictures>

Rude and slow service. Came when no one was around and took 10 minutes before any one came with water and menus. We were in a rush for the airport so we just walked out. I told the waiter to improve his service next time by being more attentive. He just said “don’t come back next time.”

Also, it seems like they’re running some day care out of this restaurant. Lots of kids toys littered on the ground and the whole restaurant environment appears unsanitary. Bad!

*Didn’t eat the food there so I can’t attest to that.</Review>

At least with most Thai if it’s average or mediocre, at least there’s a lot of it. With this each and every dish was comically small. We had take out and the food didn’t even fill the already small containers. It is overly expensive when you factor in how small everything is - and that includes soup that is maybe a small bowl for one person, definitely not to be shared and certainly not worth $10 a bowl.

It was just all average and we ended up having to go get more take out from another location so everyone could have food. Won’t happen again.<//Text>

I like this place because they were making orders fresh and they a great lunch menu , which you can try different dishes for a good price . It takes a little longer when you get there when they open 11:00 . A little slow but the food is good ,with good portion for the lunch menu . You have to try it out, it's in a small strip mall ,east of gelsons mkt.< /review>

Over priced, small portions, and the interior is a big YIKES!  There is much better food down the street at The Palm on Hollywood Blvd.

This is what I get for trying a new neighborhood place and being too lazy to drive a little further. My bad!</Review>

FRUSTRATING
Been to this restaurant a couple of times and the food is excellent. Today, for the first time, I ordered a delivery, since it is in the neighbourhood. There is a disclaimer that says it will take from 45 to 60 mins. After an hour and a half I decided to call the number that is all over the internet. 9 tries and nobody answered. An hour 43 minutes later, still haven´t got it and still nobody answers the phone,  but they charged my card inmediately. A filed a claim at the bank to have my money back.< /Review>

We ordered four dishes and the lady asked us twice for the dishes but still in the end she missed one dish for us. Also even never asked if we need rice which the white rice should be combine with our dishes, so tonight we only have two dishes and one fried rice for four ppl here. And no more food at 11pm. Very unprofessional service. How can a dish without serve with white rice?!</Text>

Took a chance as we were passing through Coloma and we were not disappointed!  This place is a gem. The pizza was great as was the salad. We ordered the Golden Bear minus onions and pineapples along with a Greek salad. Both were delicious. My wife even said the pizza was so good she didn't need to dip it in ranch. Customer service was very friendly and inviting. We will definitely stop by again when in the area.<//Review>

Very decent pizza parlor with a little bbq as well. Friendly staff. Nice patio with a view of the river. The pizza wont win awards but it tastes damn good after a long day on the river. Very respectable selection of beer. All in all I enjoyed my time there<//review>

Amazing place! The surroundings are just magical. The pizza tasted great. I am a vegetarian and I found a great option for myself there - a Caprese Pizza. They also have a live music and it just makes it even more inviting and cheerful!
Definitely recommend this place!<//Text>

<review>Customer service was magnificent. They got our pizza wrong (red sauce, not white. Margarita instead of veggie) With a pizza you don't exactly want them to have to re-do it all again so we didn't ask them to do anything, just checked in with the owner who was hustling and working the floor right along with employees and asked if we had in feed how the correct pizza. She admitted the mistake and was super understanding. She offered us apologies and a free drink. Then came back a few minutes later and offered us a whole new pizza, one they had been cooking for the staff with white sauce. She gave us that pizza plus the other we had originally gotten and extended sincere apologies... It was over the top nice. It is apparent they are working to build this place up and keep great customer relations.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x809aff8f40e708a5:0xe7f849e255a448dd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Used to work in a pizza place and this joint does it perfect. So glad it's local and I can come back again. Pizza is very fresh and they don't skimp on ingredients. Even the salads are large.< /Text>

I love this place . I wish I was a local so I could eat here more often. Order the “ Mack Daddy” so good . Plus the dough was nice and crispy on the bottom. ( I hate soggy pizza dough.) Whether you’re a local or just passing through , definitely give this place a shot.<//Text>

Really nice pizza place right next to the river. We just stopped for a drink and a pitstop while on a roadtrip but the staff was friendly and the view was really nice. They have an outside patio.we sat and watched the rafters go down the river while we drank our sodas.<//Text>

It's new, so some growing pains are to be expected . We want on a weekday, so all they had was pizza. BBQ only on the weekends, I guess. Pizza is good, lots of beer choices. Great location overlooking the river with outside dining.  The true test of any restaurant in Coloma is whether they can make it during the winter, when the rafting crowd disappears. Will the locals support it?<//Review>

We figured we would try out the new BBq spot in neck of the woods. Damm!!!!!!!!!! great ribs with a real good but not overpowering smoky flavor,Salad was massive and the band was great. Luckily we live in Pilot Hill,( 10 minutes away) so we will be here a lot.<//Review>

Hit or miss. Sometimes the pizza is delicious and almost worth the high prices, but other times the crust is significantly blackened and charred with sub-par toppings that fall far short of previous visits.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>We are staying nearby so walked to this place after spending 7 hours on the road getting to the area. They were busy so we placed a takeout order instead. We ordered one pizza and were told 20 mins. They were a hot mess. Not sure what happened with the pizza because they never told us and they told the wrong person it was on the way. Then proceeded to give it to the wrong person when it was done. Thankfully, because we were hungry, one of the lady workers took it from the customer it was given to and handed it to us instead. No sorry, no nothing. A lot of chaos. We might be able to forgive it if the pizza was awesome but it was runny and just not very good. The crust had potential too but I think we caught them on a bad night.</Text>< pictures>

Some people think they had great pizzas in their life, then they arrive to this place.
Beware, you will never be the same person after this.
Top tier, its not recommended, its a must go.

We ordered focaccia, a pesto pasta, the Marcello pizza, and tiramisù. The dessert was good, but not amazing. The rest of the food was a religious experience. The quality, flavor, and proportions of the ingredients is outstanding, as is the care with which they're prepared and served.

The menu doesn't actually say what the Marcello is, but to try describing it, it's a somewhat deconstructed pizza, served with mostly cool ingredients that aren't baked with the bread, including mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, arugula, basil, tomatoes, shaved parmesan, and a drizzle of balsamic. It's a unique experience in itself, and should be on the "must try once in your life" list for anyone who finds that description intriguing.<//review>

Please come support them and enjoy a meal to keep them going. Pizzas are great, but so is the pasta and everything else in the menu! Gracie!< /Review>< rating>

The food is good but these guys never answer the phone. It's a little ridiculous such a great restaurant doesn't have more than one phone line or a dedicated person taking to-go orders. How can I drive from Escondido to Encinitas and not be able to place my order before I arrive ?< /review>

< Review>
The food here is great, but the workers are extremely mean and service is bad. Took around 20 minutes maybe even longer for someone to take our order. Waiter came maybe 2 times the whole time mainly asked the busser for things (tipped him) and he was glad to bring us anything. Server did not care about a tomato allergy we had and was annoyed if we asked for anything. Got our food and server didn’t come for probably 30 minutes after. Had to ask busser for boxes. The hostess came up to us and basically asked us to leave because we were there too long. We told her we were trying to pay. Nobody came up to our table to give us our check after sitting there for so long then she has the audacity to ask us to leave when nobody is helping us. Left a bad tip for the sever (came to the table two times), but tipped the busser since he did everything for us. We left and were walking down the sidewalk and the server comes running after us and asked if everything was okay and we said no. He proceeded to say “I don’t need your tip.” I’ve never been treated more horribly at a restaurant before or had a server chase us down. I’ve never tipped a server as low as I did, but was very glad to tip the busser as he deserved it for doing everything for us. Still in shock that the workers are allowed to treat customers how they did and chase them down.</Review>

<user_name>Josh F< /user_name><response>None</response><Review>Buona Forchetta is excellent just like its South Park cousin. The service is solid, the food delicious and the wait is well worth it. Came here on a Thursday night and the wait was 15 minutes but people were all excited to be eating here and with good reason. My party and I decided on pizza in a jar and the 2 foot pizza with 3 flavors. The pizza in the jar was interesting and well made. The two foot pizza which easily feeds 3 people was excellent. It was warm and delicious as it was served on a large wood board in the middle of our table.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF4ddFYyMp1Q1HG3no_06P54iovwhFGIKEnae7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics></record>

<review>We had been looking forward to treating our friends to our favorite restaurant, but last night was a total disappointment. All of our food arrived cold. We sent back the pasta dishes to be heated. We did not send back our pizzas but should have because they were also cold and very under cooked. We probably will not go back. We have recommended the restaurant to so many friends, but will stop.<//review>< pictures>

<time>1617590408092</time><Text>Spectacular. Even my very fussy 9yo was blown away and kept counting how many slices of pizza he'd eaten and asking if we could come back. My wife had a yellowtail tuna special, I had the carbonara, and the kids each got pizzas. We also had the artichokes (best I've had outside Rome). Tiramisu and chocolate mousse were both excellent, but for my money the canolli was the star of the show, maybe the best I've ever had. It's good this place isn't closer to where we live cuz I'd be here every week.< /Text><userid>113512573778168263623< /userid>< gmapID>

<text>Very nice Italian eatery along the San Diego North-county coastline. They do a good job of offering outdoor seating options and the food is tasty. I give 4 vs 5 stars due to the prices which were a little steep ... BUT ... the trade off is everything is homemade and it is evident in the taste. Service is excellent as well!</text>< user_name>

<name>Seymour Titt</name><review>OUR HAPPY PLACE ! If you guys are lucky like us then you have a fav place not far from home where you LOVE to eat. This was our favorite local restaurant soon after it opened in nearby Encinitas 2 years ago and has remained so....though the covid lockdown has made our love affair very difficult at times. Lately things have been moving forward again so we decided to have dinner here on Saturday. I phoned around 1pm and spoke with Sarah who reserved a table for us at 5pm. I really can't believe we go to dinner so early these days because we never eat before 6pm at home but it gets way way busy from 5pm on at this very popular eatery. In fact after we parked our wheels just a few hundred feet from the restaurant and walked towards it we could see heaps of people waiting outside for a table. It's that good ! The very second we arrived at the hostess desk at 5pm lovely hostess Benedetta escorted us to a table on the covered side patio which was already packed out. Soon after we sat down Marco the new manager came by to welcome us. We spotted Vittorio one of our fav servers and very soon he was looking after us. Fresh baked Artisan Bread & Olive Oil plus Balsamic Vinegar to dip arrived at our table. And then 2 tall glasses of Sparkling Rose materialized in front of us. My wife spotted something she favored on the Specials of the Day menu....Gnocchi - White Beef Ragu with Artichokes on Top. Okay we will share that I said plus a Giuseppe Gourmet Pizza - no sauce......Mozzarella, Porcini, Spicy Salami, Calabrese, Baby Arugula and shaved Parmigiano. My wife agreed and that is exactly what we ordered when Vittorio returned. In the meantime I walked out the front ( put on my facial mask ) to take some pics of the folks dining on the sidewalk patio and the people waiting for a table. Within a very short time our dinner order arrived together courtesy of server Ivan ( our good mate ) and everything looked sensational. My wife tried the Gnocchi first while I tucked into a slice of the Giuseppe pizza. Totally mouth watering we both agreed. My wife doesn't drink alcohol so I was scoffing down both glasses of Sparkling Rose...quite nice too ! We had half our dinner boxed to go and ordered some dessert.....Mocha Chocolate Cake which tasted very delicate & very sweet. It was just great to enjoy dinner here again after so long. I said goodbye to the hard working pizza oven guys in the kitchen and lovely Sarah at the hostess desk. WE LOVE IT !</review></record></dataset><record>

Refined service to accompany an exceptional menu. Add in authentic preparation and servers with a personality. Doesn't matter what location I go to. Please guys don't lose the flare like everybody else does. Just order the specials and a bottle of wine. Best experience this side of covid.< /Review>

Solid Neopolitan wood-fired pizzas, great salads, and drinks. They've got a few outdoor tables during Covid so maybe arrive a little earlier than the busier times so you don't have to wait.

<text>Hands down best Italian food in the city! And affordable with perfect, friendly service! Thank you Meghan and Alfonso for the attentive and friendly service during a packed night. No wonder there are so many people. We started with the meatballs which were delicious. We had a few servings of their homemade bread from the pizza oven, too, and the oil and I believe pine nuts with the bread is amazing with the meatballs. Then the pasta is delectable and their pizza is as authentic as you can get. To top it off, the cannolis did the trick. Thanks again for the great dinner!</text></record></dataset><record>

The food is always great. This is a busy restaurant I don't understand why they won't get a second phone line or a dedicated phone answerer so you can place an order in less time than it takes to drive to the restaurant.</Text>

<Text>Oh my goodness, my wife and I saw the LONG LINES out of this place for weeks on end...and now we know why. This place is AMAZING!

With delicious "homemade" authentic Italian food, superb wines, and super nice & attentive staff, it's no wonder this place is so incredibly popular. We can't say enough nice about it.

My wife and I had tried their location just outside of downtown San Diego, when we first moved here, and was THRILLED to learn they were opening a location so close to us.

Now, if you're looking for a quiet little spot for a quiet romantic evening, this is NOT the place. Correction: It's romantic, just not quiet. I mean, it's LOUD. But then, it's tiny. I wouldn't be surprised if inside it didn't seat any more than 30 or so people. But it's worth it. And come summer, the outdoor spot will be divine.

Thank you, Buona Forchetta, for such superb food and attention to detail!

Love, Dave & Tammy< /Text>< pictures>

Had a nice dinner to start the night. Between the two of us, we ordered a salad, pasta and pizza to try each thing and also shared a bottle of wine.
We got the octopus carpaccio salad. Thinly slice tentacles that was marinated in lemon juice over a bed of arugula and a few half slices grape tomatoes and olives.
The puttanesca pizza was topped with mozzarella, anchovies, capers and olives. It was salty but beautifully tasty.
For the pasta, I wanted the bucatini pasta with the Amatriciana sauce. The noodle is like a straw, and the tomato sauce was a bit smoky from the bacon. Very good!
We got there early because it is first come first serve. The staff work like a team. Quick friendly service. We got bread with lentils in EVOO and a bottle of water for our table. The staff all wore their uniform t-shirts all with a variety of cheeky slogans of “fork”. The seating is tight, but comfortable. They have a unisex restroom with fun wall art. I’ll definitely be back if I’m in town again.</Review>

Solid Neopolitan wood-fired pizzas, great salads, and drinks. They've got a few outdoor tables during Covid so maybe arrive a little earlier than the busier times so you don't have to wait. Also, they will sell you their amazing sauce and pizza dough both regular and gluten free for when you feel like firing up your home pizza oven.<//text>

Every bite was delicious! We came here for my birthday and it could not have been better. The outside seating across the street from the train tracks kept the toddler excited. The wine selection and pasta were spot on. Highly recommend coming here. You won't be disappointed.</review>

The food was good, the waiters were very friendly, but the seating situation was not very ideal, obviously because of the current state of restaurants as a whole seating is going to be weird, but I saw about 2 or 3 cocroaches while I was eating due to us basically sitting in the curb, in fact directly behind me was a persons car. But the food and service was enough for a second visit!<//Review>

Flavor for pizza and salad and Tiramisu. Lively service staff and waiter. Most spoke with Italian accent. Had to wait 1/2 hour before we could get seated I'm 20 minutes for our pizza to come out. Full circle almost an hour after we arrived before we had meaningful food.<//text>

We had reservations at another restaurant down the road and we ended up canceling it because I wanted a good pizza. Boo! My big mistake.

We arrived and the wait time was about 20-25 minutes for a table for 2. Perfect! I thought to myself  I know the other locations is always a long wait.

We were first seated out on the patio. The fans were hitting straight on me and I knew I'd get annoyed so I asked a server if they could aim it elsewhere.
He said no he can't turn it so I said no worries. As I sat there I eventually came to my senses and decided to ask for another table.

The front staff said it would be a wait and I was perfectly fine with waiting again. We were actually sat within 5 minutes.  Our table for two was right behind the high top chairs by the glass window to the kitchen and the pathway for servers delivering the food from the kitchen.  Errr... the walkway was tight so servers walking by would bump into my chair.

Our server was very nice but we barely saw her. While she was cleaning our table i grabbed my wine and held it. She almost knocked it down. Whew...

Food:
* Pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms
* Pasta (forgot what I ordered)
It was okay but it lacked salt. See photo.
• Complimentary Bread -meh... not worth the carbs and I asked for butter.

The pizza was so bad. I ate a slice and Tupac ate a slice. We didn't event take the left overs home. The pizza was soggy. I was so disappointed.

When we walked out we both said we will never return nor will I recommend this location.<//text><Name>Nette Rab</Name>< UserId.>

The lasagna was recommended by our lovely hostess and not only did it not disappoint, it was unreal! The flavor was authentic Italian, just like the atmosphere! I felt like I was in Sorrento. My new favorite restaurant!<//Review>

We can always count on Buona Forchetta for authentic Italian experience. Their food is incredibly delicious and flavorful. They can get very busy quickly (and for good reason), so get there early or as soon as they open for dinner service to get a good table as they don't take reservations.< /review>

Great authentic Italian restaurant.  Nice location and cute atmosphere.  Pizza is excellent.  Great fresh bread at the table.  Homemade pasta.  Would be a 5 star review accept bolenase sauce a little spicy for me and parking is a little hard to find sometimes.< /review>

Mediocre. They have three vegan pizzas so they get the concept. No soy or almond milk so we could not have a latte. No vegan desert. You would think they would since they have the vegan pizzas. The marinara has no depth and is boring. Pizza crust just okay and topping on the pizza sparse. Glad i tried it once but nothing there to return for. Lackluster.<//Text>

<Review>We order the specials, yellow tail fish, some raviolis, chicken wrapped with bacon and filled veggies, with a bottle of red wine "Chianti Classico" and everything was very rich and savory. The staff was very nice and the attention was good. I would definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to try the one in Liberty station and see if is just as good.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Just left this review on Yelp; thought I'd share here, too and save searchers time! Spent over 20 minutes searching and calling around Encinitas for vegan pizza (with vegan cheese) and came up with very little. Found a picture of this place with a vegan section on the menu. Wasn't sure about the timing or parking situation, but thought we'd take a chance and it worked out. Server made great recommendations (including other items that could be modified). Food was awesome; authentic Italian-style!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Fantastic pizza. True neopolitan pizza in the area. The dough and bread are freshly made and all the ingredients are fresh and it shows in the final product. The staff are excellent and provide  great service as well. Cannot go wrong with the place but prepare for a wait though<//text>

<text>Come to Buona Forchetta for the food-the space is cramped but if you're familiar with good Italian food then this is the place. I ordered a Calzone and a tuscan salad with pine nuts was delicious. I walked out of the place after drinking wine and fine food for $100-fair prices for the quality. The service was excellent as their staff is really attentive.</text>< Pictures>

We really enjoyed a lunch here, so decided to return for dinner.  We went on a Tuesday around 7:30 pm, there were several open tables but we were told we would have to wait until a smaller table opened up, maybe 15 min.  But there were at least three open tables that seated four.  In this area, we were probably the last people to come in for the night, but no luck.  They would rather lose our business for the night than give up an empry table.  I'm so disappointed because I love to support local businesses and liked the food.  Too many other places to go where customers are appreciated.<//text>

We are so fortunate in North County San Diego County to have Buona Forchetta in Encinitas! The lines to get in are usually long, but the wait is worth it. Their pastas are amazing as are their salads and pizzas. Unfortunately, there is no lunch offering as they don't open until 4:30.</Text>

Buona  Forchetta is the best Italian food with the most wonderful and friendly service. It feels like you have been invited to dinner in Italy where everyone in the room is helping to make you feel at home. Simply scrumptious.< /Review>

Fabulous food, attentive host and a cozy atmosphere. The only drawback, it was just a little loud for intimate conversations during a busy evening rush, but the food was most definitely worth it!!!<//text>

Great pizza! Best in SoCal, rivals what you can find in and around Naples. They have very limited seating, so go early or late, otherwise you'll likely have a really long wait.< /review>

They dont take reservations, but they allow people to come and put their name in hours in advance, and then go home, and they call them.  So basically at 5pm on a Sunday, there was one couple sitting outside waiting but they had almost a two hour wait.  Really unfair for those willing to actually come and put their name and wait for a table.  We are locals and tried this place before and had a great time. Though, with these kind of unfair practices we really don't want to give them our business. There is no really good way for us to come and eat at this establishment if there's always a two-hour wait because people abused a system, and the restaurant allows them to.</text>

< Review>
We love the restaurant in South Park, so we were really happy that they came to Encinitas. We got lucky and got seats at the "bar" (which really just overlooks part of the kitchen), so we didn't have to wait. Next time, we'll ask to sit outside, as we love the outdoor seating in South Park. The bread was warm and the lentils are a nice addition. We tried some of our favorite dishes, and the calamari, artichokes, and penne bolognese did not disappoint! I got the eggplant parmesan, since they didn't have my regular gnocchi bolognese, and it was great too! Their wine selection is nice. Even though it was crazy busy, the service was good. *** We went again and tried the pizza in a jar, which was really good; the calamari never disappoints; artichokes were good. The Sofia and Margarita pizzas are great. The lasagna was good, but a bit too much meat and not enough noodles for me.< /Review>

<Text>Great service,  great food.  Will be back.  They dont take reservations,  so put your nane down and walk south a block to Capn Kenos for a drink.   CK is a local treasure to be experienced by everyone at least once.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Lively dinner atmosphere, excellent service, and amazing food! Our server's food and wine recommendations worked out really well for us.  We had the ravioli of the day, which featured prosciutto and a delicate brown butter sauce, and papardelle bolognese, Tinazzi Valpolicella Ripasso 2015, and tiramisu. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. The tiramisu was seriously the best I've ever had. We will be back soon!<//review>

MAGNIFICO ! My wife and I had dinner here last night at this newly opened Italian restaurant. From experience knowing that Buona Forchetta locations get busy we arrived around 5 pm. A young lady greeted us at the entrance and showed us to a table in the side courtyard. It was packed out inside and half full on the patio already. A server fetched us a couple of glasses of water as we settled down to peruse the menu.I ordered the house IPA which the effervescent manager Giuseppe hand delivered to our table. A server named Liz brought us a free appetizer of fresh bread & marinated vegetable topping. We had been here 5 minutes and were feeling spoiled rotten. Our main server Luca took our dinner order for a plate of Amatriciana / Bucatini pasta & the Barbara white pizza. Giuseppe the manager came by to say hello again and check on us. In the twinkling of an eye our meals arrived at our table. Friendly server Liz popped by to grate fresh parmigiana on both our meals. And of course I added some chili flakes to my half of the fabulous looking pizza. The pasta tasted so perfect and the sauce just a tad spicy. The pizza was exactly as we used to at Buona Forchetta restaurants....a little crusty around the edge and soft near the center with that beautiful Italian flavor. We ate everything in front of us. We could have fitted in some Gelato for dessert but Giuseppe informed us they didn't have the gelato yet.....we understood as they only opened 5 days ago. We had been chatting all evening with the friendly couple at the next table...Tony & Rachel and really had a sensational evening. Sadly it was time to go and there was a throng of people on the sidewalk waiting to grab our table. We paid the bill and said goodbye to our mate Giuseppe. We will tell our friends and can't wait to come back !< /review>

Janka the lovely hostess at the front entrance showed us to a table inside when we arrived soon after 1pm. A server named Alfonso brought a carafe of water plus glasses of water and a serve of complimentary fresh bread to our table soon after we sat down. Our main server Emiliano introduced himself and looked after us like royalty the whole time we were there. We ordered a couple of hot lattes while we thought about our lunch choice. Emiliano made the lattes himself and they tasted extraordinary ...must have been the Italian Danesi coffee beans. In the end we ordered the Angela Pizza and to our amazement our fabulous looking pizza arrived within 2 minutes. Our pizza disappeared with 5 minutes .......  delectable heaven! We know when we have lunch or dinner at a classy Buona Forchetta restaurant that the food will be great, the service will be amazing and the ambience will be relaxing. Thanks to server Alessia for her friendly service at the end !<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>(Translated by Google) When you come to a nudist beach in San Diego
The way home is an early dinner here.
It's like this at 18:00 on Saturday.
Good to come early!
The food here is really delicious.
Especially recommended truffle risotto.
This is exquisite!
There are many delicious dishes in the United States.
It ’s a great restaurant.
Please note that reservations cannot be made here.

サンディエゴのヌーディストビーチに来たら
帰りはここで早めの晩御飯。
土曜日の18時にはこんな感じで並んでる。
早めに来てよかった！
ここの料理は本当に美味しい。
特にオススメはトリュフのリゾット。
これは絶品です！
アメリカも美味しい料理やさん沢山ある。
素晴らしいレストランですね。
ここは予約ができないのでご注意下さいね。< /Text>< Date>

It can be very reasonable in the price but if you ask for the specials of the day just ask before why they are usually almost double what is already on the menu .. but we love the gniocchi and the pizzas !!

Lately I find myself traveling frequently to Vista California for work.  I'm always looking for great local places to eat.  Wasabi is a quaint little place, with great food, and service.  Its my new Sushi "Go to" while traveling the San Diego area.<//text>

Best sushi in San Diego area or probably anywhere. The service is awesome too. We had the waitress recommend the best one and she gave us the sushi she eats whenever working there. Which was the best piece of sushi I've ever had. I didn't even taste like sushi. It had lemon slices and chili. Just perfect. Also the fried rice is out of this world!</review>

Philly roll seemed to be a lot of rice and cucumber. Not even a lot of cream cheese let alone salmon. And on top of this their prices are fairly high. Won't be going back here.<//review>

<review>Hard to find good sushi places lately, but this one did not disappoint for me whatsoever. Definitely will come back when I can... Hopefully that is soon. I recommend the Vista roll. It was my favorite and will most likely stay that way. Staff are also very friendly and for being outside right now, the tables and service are very well maintained.</review></record></dataset><record>

We often bring our dogs to nearby South Buena Vista Park (excellent off-leash dog park) and were in the mood for sushi. I’m so glad we stopped here! The food was very fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. And the service was terrific - we had a very responsive and friendly waitress, Rosa, even as we ate at one of the small outside tables.</text>

<text>Quality of food has diminished. Cold, soggy and rubbery calamari. Very disappointed. Katsu was ok but I feel the quality isn’t a priority anymore and most likely I won’t order from here again.  Shame since I love supporting local businesses</text>< Pictures>

I had the dragon roll, which was simply delicious. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They have outdoor tables, which is a necessity during this pandemic. Will definitely be going back.</Text>

< review>
We only ordered sushi here. It was good but not super impressed. It didn't seem like they flavored the rice and it was slightly dry? My family member has a sensitivity capsaicin sensitivity and this place uses a lot of spicy tuna. So if that's you thing, this is the place.
I did smell a lot of delicious fried food coming out of the kitchen. Didn't get to see what it was though...</review>

Food was great here, and artisticly plated. Had a Groupon, but regular prices were right in line with most sushi places. The jalapeños and rolls were very tasty. Really nice selection of specials that sounded awesome. Will definitely be back.</review>

< Review>
The staff here are always so welcoming and attentive. This place gets pretty packed and when that happens the staff get stretched thin. My favorite rolls are vista and the hot momma. I also enjoy eating the spicy garlic edamame.< /Review>

<Review>Got absolutely wrecked here a few weeks ago. Their sake bombs are no joke. They give you a very generous amount of alcohol. The eating area is relatively plain and undecorated but they make up for it with delicious food and drinks. The server was friendly and fast.

<rate>3<//rate><review>Pretty decent Japanese food. The staff always seems so busy though and weren't the friendliest.
We went there with a Groupon. But apparently they have a lot of their own discounts going on and they cannot be stacked with Groupon. A lot of them were half off sushi rolls. So I'd say you would be okay with it without Groupon.< /review>< pics>

The food is consistent from time to time. Flavor is great but the rolls tend to be large and fall apart easily. The calimari was too chewy, but the tune was excellent.</Review>

<date>1490667139249</date><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Wow, excellent service !. It was my first time there, I read the Google reviews so i was 50/50 whether to go here. I'm glad I did, the staff was great and very attentive. The food was delicious and the presentation did not fall short of the description.The staff were open to conversations as well as the history of this place. I will definitely be frequenting this establishment. Being in close proximity of my business, I will be bringing in my special clients to this location for lunch or dinner.

To the owner and the staff, Excellent job, you've won over a new customer.< /Review>< userid>

<user>106920475550454795946</user><Rate>1<//Rate><review>One of the worst dining experiences I’ve ever had. The service at this place is unbelievingly awful, at best. No eye contact when you enter and no one acknowledges you are there or seats you. There were two waitresses who walked past us numerous times as well as the sushi chefs, and after five minutes of just standing there, we seated ourselves as did the other four parties arriving after us. The servers there literally acted like we were an imposition. Don’t expect a thank you on your way out, either, unless you are a regular as the waitstaff fell over themselves waiting on them. MANAGER/OWNER: Start reading your reviews—all of the negative reviews for the past two or three years are due to bad customer service, but it appears you don’t care.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Great quality sushi. A bit pricey depending on what you order. There many tempura fried (unhealthy) varieties, but if you are health conscious, their japanese salads are great! I chose the sashimi roll, which is mostly raw protein and has no rice. That roll is the bomb!</Text>< Pics>

Hard to give an accurate review as I ordered dinner via DoorDash from Wasabi.  I'd order differently if at the restaurant.   Some food doesn't travel as well.  However, I enjoyed the few basic things I did order and that's a good sign.  It was nice that they didn't send the cheapest soy sauce out either as other places have.  My order also arrived way ahead of the predicted delivery time.  I'd order again.<//Text>

Best restaurant I've been in a long time! Very nice , relaxing and cool place. Service was great and the kid with  (Z) on his head really impressed me with his nice decorations on the sushi. I'm sorry I forgot his name but I'll be back real soon.<//text>

Under new management but both the old and the new had some of the best sushi I ever had and I lived in Japan for several years. The windows need a little tinting because it's too bright during lunch and it's not the best decorated but I rather have great food and not have the runs the next day like from other (most) sushi places.</review>

Service maybe tad slow at times but since when are you supposed to rush sushi?

The food is good, reasonably priced and a great place to grab a quick bite. But the service is always a little lackluster. It's all young kids with hardly any personality< /Review>

<review>Have been to Wasabi a few times and the food is generally good.  On a recent visit though we were quite put off by the red table cloth on the table that was not changed between guests and was quite stained.  I would suggest that Wasabi do away with the table cloths if you cannot change them for each diner because of cost and use a simple parchment paper that is changed for each new diner.  Stained table cloths are disgusting.  Before ordering, we changed tables but probably will not return.< /review><name>Gil Hooper<//name><date>1514048321746< /date><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

The rice was flavorless, the tuna and yellowtail weren't fresh. The unagi was pretty good, but it wasn't enough to redeem the experience. Overall very poor quality sushi, I wouldn't order from here again.<//text>

<Review>Hooked!!! This place is amazing, 5 stars for great food and awsome environment. I had the wasabi handroll  the rooster roll and something custom not sure what its called, (the nigori had kicked in) but the chef made a recomendation based on my order and it was spot on. Had a great time!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I don't know how this place could possibly get a bad review.  The service is always above par, the sushi is delicious (I am Japanese and very picky), and the restaurant is clean.  The sushi chefs always greet you and thank you as you leave.  I frequent this sushi bar at least once a week and I have never left disappointed.  I made a point to review Wasabi, as I think other reviews are unfairly biased.<//review>

This is, absolutely, the most terrible Sushi place I have EVER been to. First off, the "hostess" just handed me a piece of paper with the names of the rolls on it. I understand that most rolls are the same wherever you go, but THEY HAD MENUS, she just didn't give me one. Second, I didn't even get my water until AFTER my roll had come out. The guy that worked behind the bar (maybe the owner) was so completely rude. It was shocking. I was asking questions about the different rolls and he was so mean to me about it. My co-worker and I both ordered a California roll, and then we ordered a Dynamite roll to share. The California roll was fine, but when we got the Dynamite, we were both in disgust. It was not a roll whatsoever. It was literally a pile of mush on a plate covered with foil, with cheese baked on top. It was not a roll at all. When we asked the guy about it, he got MAD. Um, excuse me? It's a Dynamite ROLL that we ordered not a pile of fish thrown in a toaster. He immediately told the hostess to go get our checks. The man literally kicked us out of the place, for being unsatisfied. I still can't believe how rude he was. That is no way to run a business. Not one that's going to make it, anyway. And to top it off, the place was filthy, the walls and counters were dirty, it was awful.
I went out of my comfort zone, and decided to try something else (other than Loveboat sushi in San Marcos - BEST EVER) and I will NEVER and I repeat NEVER go there again.</review>

Not one Japanese employee.....always a bad sign. Would not go back again. Very dis-organised, slow and expensive. Waitresses do not know what they are doing, or much about sushi. Charged for sake I did not receive! Not a good experience.< /Text>

Why Great Food ???
Just eat the following and Judege
1. Shadow Bridge Sushi.
Yumm, nicely presented with shrimp tempura, cucumber topped w/ avocado, diced soft shell crab mixed with spicy mayo, eel sauce. Mouthwatering...yes.
2. Chicken Katsu
If you like Indian food, you will like this. This Katsu reminded me the Potato curry my wife cooks, with deep fried chicken w/rice and salad
3. Bento Box: Biggest box I have seen in any Japanese Restaurant.

Why moderate service ???
Forced smile from the waiter and behave like Robots. Nothing wrong absolutely, but missing the passion. Could improve.

Why Poor Atmosphere ???
Seating arrangement is horrible. Out of 10 seating tables, 3 faces Kitchen sink with people walking in and out. 2 Of them very close to the door, my back side was frozen. 1 blocking the restroom door.
Few Sushi table chairs, awkwardly placed. Please re-arrange them and remove few tables.

If you fix this Interior and Service, you are a 5 star. I will come back again for sure, just for Shafow Bridge Sushi 😊
PS: Out door have only 2 chairs and one table, Dogs are OK outside.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>ordered some take out of yakisoba and teriyaki chicken... took a long time (only 4 other customers...) and the food was sub par. the teriyaki had really small/thin breasts and the yakisoba noodles we're super small and dry. could use some mentoring from an actual Japanese person...<//Review>< Pictures>

Small but cozy. Lacking in experienced wait staff - very slow service.< /Review>

I ordered the Bento Box with salmon.  Miso soup was part of the Bento Box.  The waitress totally forgot to bring the Miso soup. She just brought the Bento Box without the soup. We had to ask for the soup. I'm not sure why. But that's not how is done.  The piece of salmon that I got was unevenly  slice. One side was overcooked. The other was normal. I guess the restaurant was trying to save their overhead cost. Again the waitress was preoccupied with something else.  We had to asked for more water and ginger. We would be better of going to the sushi bar.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Like its name suggests, Alta Plaza Park is pretty high up on a small hill with four levels of stairs leading up to its central plateau , where you will be rewarded with a sweeping view of the southern part of the city that I think matches the one of Alamo Square but much less touristy. There are a playground (at the hill top!), two tennis courts, and plenty benches and spots for picnic. And obviously the park is an excellent place for stair exercises and even hill training for runners.
The structure of the park has a simple beauty,  very easy to orient yourself and walk around. All in all, this is one of the better city parks in SF.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful spot, panoramic views of the city. Ample benches dotted around, perfect for lunching or just chilling. The benches are long and clean, so they're great for socially distanced hanging out! Walking up can be a bit steep for someone with mobility challenges, but generally easy access for most, including strollers as the paths are wide and mostly smooth. A playground on the top and some tennis courts. It's quiet, with occasional picnic-ers on sunny days. South-facing side can get windy some days, but the west facing side is a bit more sheltered from the wind. Fillmore food stretch is just a block away, so I love to grab a sandwich and eat in the sun at the park at lunch. Kid and dog friendly, but mind the slopes - I see many balls make a break for it!</text>

<Text>Lots of sun or shade if you prefer either. Hills and steps all over for leg day. Never seen it too crowded even on the sunniest days. Great views of the city all around it since it's so elevated.</Text>< Pictures>

View of the bay on a clear sunny day from Alta Plaza park. Great park for a lazy leisure picnic. You can pick up great to-go food from nearby Fillmore St.  All social distancing rules followed here. Pets allowed.</text>

Beautiful park located on a hill. The views are amazing especially when the sun is going down. There’s a lot of dogs running around all over the place which is ok but it would probably be better if they built a doggy park just for them so they can run and play with each other.< /Text>

This is one of those neighborhood parks that's elevated and has a really great view. You can see Alcatraz at one place. The view from the other side is just as nice. Dogs are allowed on one side of the park. Great place to bring a blanket.
There are these really large stairs which are great for exercise.< /text>

<review>This park is a great place to just relax and hang out with friends. I come here all the time and I always enjoy myself. Depending on the day you go, it’s usually not crowded at all. Chestnut street isn’t that far of a walk from here considering all of the streets leading up to Chestnut street are heading downhill. Alta plaza is also not far from California street which has one of my favorite Boba places in the city, Tea Hut. I would recommend coming here if your looking for a place to hang out with friends.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< userid>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Love this park! Great for all your outdoor activities. The remodel is gorgeous and a treat to enjoy. My dog loves it here and we love taking him! Tons of dogs here in the morning and after work, lots of space for your pup to run and fetch the ball. Some of the park is designated on leash but it's not clearly marked and no one really takes that rule seriously.

Bring a picnic and enjoy one of the best views in the city.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW4T0yMDgLQdiRfAX45w0KWGacc9BKE-IYxdoL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPO8f4OtTcZt3XAdTfpfl5H3VPd7ggdG8Vni_MA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVNEY0rTfi1doo7tKUWKyeljJW2tykbX5UuAqR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzDqCmbyFoXxGmrRhf7mwZF0lGsG5N8iORmWrV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaz-B0EyFT3Tvy-dJKnsfYerGFqPtLt3bExJvj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmucjIDRJWEf7fALlPn8UDdn3ZZGwX2xQW--Ep=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN6qsaxGINafIblgsf-_6elxLQhSBm-c1Z3PyG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuWMBw_1O5h8-OVmT6IKJvMhMJbs13NDI_Qo86=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgxkecAkbByH_7jjID7Jugt5vKLEdIWIovjaO1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

No interactive art, no fountains, few beautiful trees, nice place to relax for a bit. Very far from some of American, European, Japanese Parks I've enjoyed. Very nice in its way.</review>

Really nice park, great place to walk your dog or on fleet week weekend is an ideal place to watch the blue angels. The only problem is that they close down parts of the park for a few months every once and a while to re do the drainage system in the park. The do this even though they re did it just like a year before which is really annoying. but besides that it is a great park and awesome place for dogs.< /Text>

A lovely neighbourhood park with great views of the city. Free tennis courts, a playground, room to suntan, and some super steep/wide stairs to get a great work out in. Some fences are up right now as I believe they are fertilizing but once they come down it will be even better!!< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1593662270426< /Time><Review>I've walked along this park several times before I walked in. It is in a beautiful neighborhood. Since it is on top of a mountain, it offers an excellent vantage point to see parts of the city that you normally wouldnt be able to unless you lived in a high-rise. It also has two Tennis courts and a basketball court with a kids play area. The benches along Clay St are a great place to sit and stare at the city below.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Amazing views!! super set playground!! It was our first time here and it is excellent if you want a soft hike, as it is kinda steep to get through the sides if not you have to go around the hill to get to the top... but it it's simple if my little ones can handle it you can handle it😋😉...

The views are awesome and super open!!

On a side note and you will see in one of the pictures, they are renovating something so just beware were you park as some entrances are closed or limited,  and sorry but I don't know the date on when this will be done...

Super fun for all ages and pets!!</text>< Pictures>

Love having this park so close to our place. Walk my dog over here regularly. Tons of stairs to run if you're interested. Park and tennis courts at the top. Views of the city are fantastic.< /review>

Fantastic park with great views of the city. Huge stairs so if you wanna work on your glutes this is the right place. There were about 3 women doing just that. Good place for a picnic and not to far from some really pretty mansions.< /Text>

One of the most beautiful places in San Francisco. A great park, lots of dogs, beautiful view of the water. I love to run up and through this park. There's a big children's playground and some tennis courts.<//text>

It is a tiered hill that is quite tall. Stairs lead up to different levels, each with walking paths that circle the park. There are many benches throughout to sit and take in the great views of Sutro tower and the surrounding neighborhoods of pacific heights, western addition, NoPa, marina and the Bay, and some sky scrapers of downtown.
At the top there are tennis courts, a kids playground and many other amenities.
I love this park because it is never over run with tourists and you really feel like you get some good exercise climbing to the top! I</review><Response>None< /Response></record>

Alta Plaza Park has a spectacular view of surrounding SF neighborhoods. I often come here to vent and be myself, but also to write report and submit them. Little ones will probably spend the whole day here. Warmer weather you'll see people laying on the grass and soaking it in. Good for family outing on any given day except for rain. Be careful walking on hilly grass areas, they're slippery. Next time you see a Audi S5 with a guy in it, that may very well be me. Fun times, fun times.</Review>

Great place to take the kids for the day . We went to the kids area. There's a merry-go-round and a long bumpy slide. My kids ran up the stairs to go down that slide about a hundred times.</Review>

It's a nice park with nice views. Expect a queue at the men's restroom though, for some reason it has only one stall.</review>

Great park, beautiful views of the city. Located in Pacific Heights. The playground structures look to be new, my kids had a wonderful time. It appears that dogs can run off leash as well. Tennis and basketball courts too.< /text>

Large open spaces, some almost flat. Dogs at the top of the hill, and owners actually clean up. Great playground in the middle. Elbow room in the crowded city. Warning: parking is street only, fairly tight.

Like rolling down hills? This place is perfect.< /Review>

<resp>None<//resp><review>A very nice park with a great view. I would come here to relax and have lunch while overlooking the city. For the most part Kid friendly. surrounded by cute buildings. I didn't like that people just go around with their dogs off leash and I saw and picked up/threw away some broken glass bits which is obviously bad for both kids and dogs.< /review>< name>

<Time>1566787644513</Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>One of several SF parks on top of hills that are worth visiting. The impressive view of JFK Apartments at night and the city Skyline whenever there is no fog from the Pacific. You can walk here with you family, dog, or alone, sit on numerous benches and enjoy the views of the City or the Bay, play tennis or take a rest on the grass.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Vista Thermos Natural Park is THE perfect spot for a relaxing picnic and walk. The walking path is well-maintained and has several benches to sit & rest and/or simply stop to enjoy the scenery. It's hard to believe the park is in DELA. The park offers beautiful views of the skyline/buildings. The park is clean/well-maintained; the restrooms as well. If you can't find parking, there's always street parking.<//text>

We have had our Shih Tzu Meetup there every month for 16 years. We really like the openness and safety. Sometimes it is too damp although they spent many months working on the drainage. The new landscaping is very nice.< /Text>

<Text>This park is so well maintained and amazing views of the entire city. It feels like a real neighborhood as dogs off leash play with one another, neighbors visit, exercise groups enjoy in the morning, with tennis and great playground for kids.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Great place for dogs and kids
But watch the parking around it. It may be free but I got a ticket for parking on a street cleaning day. Did not see any signage stating so
. Next time will circle and double , triple check. It will cost me $76</Review>< rating>

Currently under construction (July 2018), but the kids playground is good and it's a nice place to wall your dog as well.

It is just east enough that you're not sopped up in fog all the time.

Occasionally, there is a transient or 2 there, but it hasn't been common the times I've been.  The worse problem, like everywhere in SF is parking.

Update: August 22, 2018...still under construction for some reason.<//text>

One of the most pleasant green areas in SF, offering an outstanding view of Alcatraz and the SF Bay. The often heard horn blowing of the ferries are a daily reminder of the bustling touristy activity down the hill from the park. Great for families and kids.< /Review>

If you can survive the trek up the hills, the view and park itself are great spots to relax. Plenty of lawn space to set out some picnic blankets on.< /Text>

<Review>This is the park that the observatory sits in.  This park is HUGE and it is a wonderful place to hike.  When you get to the top you can get some of the best views of the city and the best part? It's FREE!!!  For a city that I have always thought about the Hollywood shopping, I never expected such a grand green space!</Review><user_id>109094371548081464921< /user_id><Response>None</Response>< rating>

Fantastic views over the city and there's a good chance you will have the place almost to yourself on a week day. Although it can be very cold here even on a warm day so it's best to be prepared for that. If you are looking for a bit of peace and quiet then this is a good place to start.<//review>

It's a beautiful, spacious park nestled within the mid-northern parts of San Francisco.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Nice park with great views of the city. It doesn't have a huge grassy area, but it's still decent. It also has a good playground for kids.

One of the most important events that goes on here is PUG SUNDAY! It's the first Sunday of every month at 2:30pm, and it's a great place to bring your pug if you have one, or just watch them chase each other if you don't.

Alta Plaza is also a nice, not crowded place to watch the fireworks on the 4th of July, if you don't mind getting the lower part of some fireworks cut off.<//review>< rating>

Under construction at the moment.  Otherwise a great place for families and kids.  But, please clean up after your dog.  Not much parking, but that's what cabs are for.<//Text>

Great views of the city at the top of the park. The stairs are great for a workout. You can bring your dog and your children to this park. It seems to almost have everything for almost any activity. There is a basketball court and tennis courts as well as a children's play area. I like how you can walk around the middle and top of the park.< /text>

Newly renovated with new irrigation and grass. Nice for dogs. People and dogs are friendly. Nice park and tennis courts for kids. Incredible views of the city with narrow views of the Bay and Alcatraz.</Review>

I love this park for 3 reasons: 1) Views - the most gorgeous views of the city. 2) Children's Playground - my son loves the play structures, the slides, and the sandbox. There are multiple structures that can appeal to different age groups and most of the equipment are in good shape. 3) Dog Park - my son looooooves dogs but I'm not in the position to have a pet right now. Solution? I take him to Alta Plaza as there are tons of fun dogs and very friendly owners. Almost everyone allows us to pet their dogs. I didn't give it 5 stars because it can be hard to find parking. If you're within walking distance though, I totally recommend stopping by this park!<//Text>

at a recent Pug Meetup, it's like Dim Sum: they run around freely and you just grab whatever you can get your hands on.  everyone is pug happy, until they start peeing on you, you sit in poop, and you realize it's an evil, fetishist, orgy of hairy animals, pets and owners alike...</Text>

Small regular park, but with some sport pitches where to play. It's forte is the elevated position which gives a nice view of the city.< /Review>

The view is breathtaking from either side. Great place for a picnic on the bay side, though note that depending on time of day, you may get some doggie visitors. The park is my dog's fave place to sniff trees and play with other pups who are also quite friendly. Great playground and party spot for the little kids, and multiple tennis courts for the adults to play in. :)

Fun Fact: The steps are featured in the 1972 film "What's Up, Doc?". They were used without permission and were badly damaged during filming; the damage can still be seen today.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Spanish name means 'high' (altitude) square~plaza~park... duh, and it is a clear far vista of about 300 of 360°, dog run and field on the north bordered by  'old money' mansions. And the South side is a ziggarat shaped drop and the view scans all the way to Mt. San Bruno. 🐺</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) I love this park, it has some magnificent trees that contrast with the beautiful art-deco architecture of the area. The views are also beautiful.

<Text>(Translated by Google) It does not appear in most tourist guides but it is a large green area with good views because of its elevation. A good place to rest during nice weather.
