Good Afternoon,
This was one of the nicest experiences I've had in a long long time. I was greeted promptly but not over bearing. I had done my research and knew what I was looking for. The salesman listened to us, showed us our options and we are actually out the door in 45 minutes we our new mattress. I would recommend Mattress Firm to everyone. Thank you. We've been waiting for this for a long time.<//review>

<Text>I had done some research on mattresses before I went to several stores. It can get very confusing real fast. Patrick at the Turlock store was very knowledgeable about all the different ones. Even then it was still confusing. I knew what type I was looking for. He was helpful steering me to the right one.   I asked for his best offer and if there was a discount for my husband’s military service.  It was nice to work with him and did not feel like I was pressured.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The dudes who work there were genuinely friendly and helpful and had good senses of humor, which was helpful because shopping and talking to people can be stressful for me. The mattress I bought is comfortable and has been great for me so far. I ordered the mattress to be delivered to my house and it arrived on the day they said it would (which I appreciate greatly, 'cause it's not always the case with some places). An entirely positive experience!</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Mes was very kind and helpful.  After going to multiple store trying to find the right mattress, Mes was able to guide me to a comparable mattress for a fraction of the price!  Not only did I get an amazing mattress for a significantly reduced price, but he also threw in a box spring and their gold service delivery for free!  I am still amazed at his kindness and eagerness to help us find the perfect mattress to fit both my husband’s and I’s needs.  I strongly recommend making this your first stop when mattress shopping!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Mes was very helpful.  He encouraged us to try different beds, made sure we asked all the questions we needed to ask to make a knowledgeable decision. We were first time buyers, but he made us feel good about our purchase. He even arranged for our cover to come to our Turlock address and the bed to be delivered to our new home in Modesto.  My husband and I highly recommend Mes at the Turlock store!<//Review>

He took us through soft, firm then middle of the road mattresses which was great because we were first time mattress buyers and really had no idea what we wanted.
I’m thankful he took the time to walk us through and point out each mattress and what it was good for. We ended up buying a mattress and got a great deal with an adjustable frame to it, to be delivered the next day!

I was desperately in need of a new mattress and had a wonderful experience working with Mesfin from the Monte Vista store. He was very informative and explained all the pros and cons of each mattress I tried. At no point did I feel pressured into purchasing as I went back several days to make sure I was certain on my purchase. They have a great variety of products and you are guaranteed to find something! I will continue to shop at this store anytime it’s time to replace my mattress.<//review>

Customer service is almost more important than the product itself. The moment my wife and I walked into Mattress Firm in Turlock, CA (Target Shopping Center), Mes was absolutely incredible. Mes, took his time educating us and demonstrating products he knew–based on our feedback–we would love. He was careful to explain the “why” and allowed us to experience each mattress until we found the right one.

I’m a firm believer one’s encounter with a sales person should never feel like you’re talking to a “sales person” but rather someone who is attentive, who leads with empathy, and is compassionate. Mes was able to pair us with a product that will enrich our life for years to come. His attention to my detail was uncanny. When I thought I had everything I needed, Mes showed me how I could further enhance my sleep with an adjustable base.

My wife and I left to discuss our investment and returned a few days later fully confident of or purchase, but unequivocally resolute in Mes. He had our best interest at heart. By the time it was all said and done, I wanted to take Mes out for dinner to express our gratitude.

I cannot speak more highly of Mes and the quality of service he delivered. Thank you so much!<//Review>

He made finding a new mattress an enjoyable experience rather than
it feeling like a chore. I would absolutely recommend anyone looking for a

Ned was the gentleman who helped my fiancé and I pick out our perfect bed. He was very knowledgeable and helped us find our perfect bed. My fiancé likes firm and I like soft and we settled on a medium-firm cool mattress. He helped us out a lot and we are very happy with the service we had!</Review>

Lindsay was Great. So knowledgeable and easy to work with. No pressure we went just to look with family and ended up going the next day and purchased a new Serta mattress for us. Great prices and no money down and no finance charges for 4 years. Can't do better than that.. Thanks again Linsay😉👍< /review>

The staff was knowledgable and curious. Talked with Justin and took full advantage of the labor day sale. I ended up saving $1200. 0% financing for 72 months. Best way to buy a bed.</text>

Let me just start of by saying WOW!!!. Mesfin, who is the manager at this store was so great at answering all my questions about warranties, type of bed, and so on. He is well informed on all the products that they carry and he simply knows his stuff. I was so pleased at the quality of service that I received from him and I am beyond happy with my Bed Purchase. Not only do I highly recommend going to this Mattress Firm in the Target plaza but speed the man "Mesfin" . Again thank you and will definitely be doing more business here in the future.</Text>

I purchased my mattress from Mattress Firm a little over a year ago (original review below) and I wanted to upgrade my pillows. I initial bought some cheap pillows off of Amazon when I purchased my bed and now a year later and the pillows are lumpy and causing me some discomfort in my neck. I decided it was time to invest in some good quality pillows, so I reached out to Mesfin who was still with the company (thank God!) and he advised me that I should come into the store during their Memorial Day Sale to test out some options.

Mesfin educated me on the importance of a good pillow. He had me test out several pillows, on the exact make and model of the bed that I initial purchased from Mattress Firm, so that I could see how the pillow felt on top of my actual bed! Who would have thought that, that was a thing?!! Makes sense though when you think about it.

I purchased 2 great pillows. I'm so glad that I did not purchase the pillows online and that I took the time to come into the store. I am even more thankful that Mesfin helped me with something so trival as picking out pillows.

Once again, I've had a great experience with Mattress Firm & Mesfin. I will be going back for all my future mattress and of course pillow needs!

Review as of 2/22/18

As a woman I am always leery of being taken advantage of when it comes to things such as getting any work done on my vehicle, or in this case buying a brand-new mattress.  I went to Mattress Firm to do some preliminary research before I made a purchase. I was greeted by the store manager, Mesfin, who was welcoming and personable. He took me around the show room and educated me on each mattress. He was extremely knowledgeable about their selection of mattresses and was very patient with me. I tested each one out and by process of elimination, he helped me find the perfect mattress for me. He took his time and answered all my questions, he really exceeded all my expectations. When I was finally ready to make my purchase 2 weeks later, he even helped me get financing!  Overall, I had a pleasant experience, Mesfin took the nervousness and anxiety out of making such a huge purchase.<//text>

Mesfin was so amazing! He was occupied when we walked in the door but approached us to let us know he would be with us shortly because he was tied up. He was very informative. It was a first time purchase for us as a married couple and he supplied so much intel on mattresses that we had no clue of. We bought our bed and will definitely be back to buy the kids new mattresses as well. Thank you so much Mattress Firm in Turlock!!!!<//Text>

Cute patio, nice and clean. Thought they wouldn't have my flavor but with a double check it made my day. Gorgeous fancy hookahs. Better than some other spots in the neighborhood for sure. We tried the same flavors elsewhere and it wasn't a great set up. This spot has those super fancy bowls and heat management. I saw a fancy  all glass one while I was there too. See photo.

One thing was it's right next to some type of homeless shelter maybe? Some crazies walking around smoking, dancing, yelling. But... people are people and nobody bothered us.

The sun hit us just right and we enjoyed our fresh smoke. Friendly owners. Definitely recommend this chill spot over Myst. Even with the goofy neighbors.

Wished I had tried to food. :)< /Review></record>

I would give it more than 5 stars.the service is amazing and they know what hospitality is. The lady was so welcoming with her smile and she took care of us really well. We ordered Turkish coffee and it was yummy and they are so generous with the coffee bean. Also a grape hookah was fantastic usually I get itchy throat but not here it was perfect from the time I started it until I finished. I noticed that they also care about the material they use for the hookah was so clean and high quality. They also served us a complimentary popcorn and nuts. This is definitely will be my place to go to from now on.</review>

High quality! It’s like an outdoor kiosk seating around with your hookah. Great place to pick up some coffee if you’re in downtown. Turkish coffee is thumbs up! Great fast and helpful service. Also amazing for catch up with friends especially on a nice outdoor day!<//text>

I’ve tried a lot of Lounges in SD. Their Hookahs are amazing you can smoke them for couple hours and still feel you just got it! Best Turkish coffee and tea! Professional service and friendly staff! I highly recommend it! Also, the prices are affordable and they have 50% off all the hookahs 1-7pm every day! What else would you want! 😁<//Review>< name>

I always love to visit new places and this one became my new favorite lately. There are some other hookah shops around but this one is different. First of all the hookka is amazing. They know what they are doing. The first time i have been there, Koray told me they have more than 30 flavors and also they offer some special mixes. I let him choose for me and he brought me the mint chocolate chill hookah. Great flavor! Its the best if get a latte with it. Staff is very friendly. This place is roomy with a high ceiling. You can smell the fresh air. Its not like other places. Perfect experience for hookah lovers. Also don't forget to try Turkish coffee and tea. Best in downtown San Diego.</review>

The waiter (maybe owner?) was kind of rude - shisha was burning good til he came by, added too many fresh coals, and burned it all. Was double the price I'm used to in the Midwest (about $25 for a bowl instead of $12). The herbal lemon ginger tea was good.</review>

Highly recommended

We went to this place to try hooka for thw first time. So we were having trouble with Figuring out the hooka thing. Koray, the guy who works there was really helpful, and helped make the experience much better.< /Review>

< Review>
Dr.Seaton was personable, caring, attentive and knowledgeable. He took the time to get to know a little bit about me which I think is really important, it shows that he doesn’t see the patient as just a patient! The staff was excellent, always asking if I needed water or anything while I waited for my hygienist. Speaking of, my hygienist was wonderful! I forgot her name but she was gentle, always making sure I was comfortable and very sensitive to my pain level. I cannot recommend this office enough!</Review>

<Text>Our 8 year old son needed his first cavity filled.  Dr. Seaton and his staff were AMAZING!! He was very patient with our son and explained the entire process, in kid terms of course to him.  Our son is normally very nervous when he goes to the dentist from a previous dental office we had gone to. Dr. Seaton has taken all those fears away.  Thank you from the bottom of this moms heart for being so AMAZING.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80917f21cd608a65:0x9406dd99b9a0ff41</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I just got out of my appointment today.  It was by far the most pleasant experience I’ve had at any medical facility ever.  I was greeted at the door by Erin who did a great job making me feel comfortable and cleaning my teeth after some neglect on my part.  I felt very thankful to have someone that cared working on my teeth.  I was then seen by a younger doctor who was very polite and professional.  He explained in detail what he was looking for on my x rays and what I could do to maintain my teeth in the future.   The office is beautiful — it’s more like a custom home than a dental office.  Haley at the front desk had a great attitude when I was paying for the service.  Overall this place is 10/10 and for the first time ever, I’m actually looking forward to my next dental appointment.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>I took my soon for orthodontist evaluation, sadly he referred to me with an specialists because of my son situation.
Therefore we were treated courteously by everyone of the team.
We feel really confortable with Dr. Seaton, he seems to be very professional y knowledgeable.
I will return for other services.<//text>< name>

The office is clean and comfortable. The staff are pleasant and friendly. Although when getting my teeth cleaned the hygienist cut the inside of my upper lip and stabbed my gum in the back a couple of times. I just wish the hygienist could be a bit more careful.< /Text>

<Text>Today I had myself and my daughters (3.5 and 6) there for the first time. The entire staff was kind, welcoming, and SO patient with all of us. We were at the office a total of 4 hours with everything that needed to be done (not consecutive) but the entire time everyone was so nice to us, they took ALL covid precautions. I felt so great about my visit. After having 1 dentist for 25 years it’s hard to change but I felt so welcome it was an easy transition! 10/10 recommendation for me!!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Dr. Seaton is truly the best. Always making sure the patient is comfortable, that if I wasn't he would stop until we could go on. He does a very great job and had a great work ethic.  He is very gentle and gets visits done quickly and efficiently. If you are looking for the best dentist in town, Dr. Seaton is the one for you.      r  Dawn F.< /review>

Awesome staff who is dedicated to your experience and the value of your time. I’ve experienced my appointment times are ON time!  The hygienist’s are helpful, informative, and very skilled. The front counter is above bar and always there to make sure your appointment goes well, meets your requirements, and schedule. The doctor is very pleasant, attentive, and overall great at his job.< /review>

Dr. Seaton and his staff are the absolute best! I had a traumatic experience getting a filling as child and was terrified to go to the dentist for many years. From my very first visit with Dr. Seaton he quickly earned my complete trust. He has a gift and has mastered his craft! I can rest assured that my family is in good hands when we visit. He is personable and it’s evident that he genuinely loves his community. His staff are also friendly and hospitable from the moment you walk in and the office is clean and peaceful. I have nothing, but raves for Dr. Seaton and staff!<//Review>

Dr. Seaton’s office is the place to go for quality care and work.
I am always happy to visit even with some of the dental fears I have.
Each person I encounter from front desk to exam chair is kind, knowledgeable and really does their best to keep their patients happy and healthy. I have had my fair share of dental work and I’ve been to many dental offices to help normalize my smile due to some abnormalities. I am lucky to have found the perfect match for my needs at Dr. Seaton’s.  This office exceeds my expectations every time I come in for a visit and I look forward to the improvements they continue to make on my smile.
I always recommend this practice to my family and friends.<//review>

<text>As much as I love to have a clean mouth and teeth I really dislike the cleaning process. But today for the first time in my life I truly enjoyed getting my teeth cleaned the technician that worked on me was awesome. She was very professional and did a very good job in such a short time. I was like in and out with no pain and no drowning 😉😁 so thank you Erick and the rest of Dr. Seaton wonderful staff. ❤< /text>< Pics>

I was having problems with my front top and bottom teeth thinning and chipping, but today Dr. Seaton corrected that. The results were unbelievable!  They are perfect! He did an excellent job at restoring my teeth! I had found myself not wanting to smile, but not anymore! It was a life changing experience.  Thank you Dr. Seaton and thank you to all the staff. They are all excellent at their jobs and always friendly and helpful. You are all the best!< /text>

I got in my car after the first appointment and was so relieved I found a dentist that cares. His staff actually read the paper work I filled out(no one ever does that). I walked in and found a blanket waiting for me and the Hygienist asking questions regarding my paper work. I'm very thankful for his office.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

What a great dentist and staff!  Always friendly, always clean, always on time!  The staff is very attentive and does everything they can to make the visit go smoothly. The dentist is very knowledgeable and really takes his time to explain procedures and knows how to make my kids all feel comfortable. They never complain about going to the dentist!  You’re amazing Dr. Seaton!  Thanks so much for everything!</review>

Staff was friendly and professional.  Dr. Seaton attempts to make his patients as comfortable as possible.  He also provides information, like digital pictures, during the exam in order for a patient to better see and understand any issues with their teeth.</review>

<review>It's hard finding a dentist that I'm comfortable with and I can trust. I live in Gilroy and drive to Los Banos to see Dr. Seaton. I've always had bad experiences with Dentist so when I find one I like the drive is worth it. Staff is super friendly and professional.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I absolutely adore Borge dentist! Both are very professional, friendly, they explain everything that they are going to do.  The front seat staff is brilliantly wonderful!  The dental hygienist are amazing. They also will discuss everything they are going to do. They will talk with you when they find something.   I highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I’ve been to other name brand dentist offices in the past and they lack in every aspect of a what a visit to a dentist office should be. The staff is super friendly and respectful as soon as you walk in the door. Benjamin and all the assistants are friendly and try to make you as comfortable as possible while in the office. They do great work and answer any questions you have while you’re there. I recommend everyone go if you have gone to any other office or if it’s your first time. Make an appointment and find out. In my opinion they’re he’s the best dentist in Los Banos.< /text>< pics>

<Review>I have nothing but great things to say about Dr Seaton’s practice. I’ve been a patron of his office for almost 20 years and won’t trust anyone else with my dental care needs. Previous to my new hygienist, Carissa, I was one of Shawn’s patients. Sad to see Shawn move, but was just as satisfied with Carissa’s cleaning. The staff is all very professional, the office is immaculate and just always a pleasant experience. Dr Seaton meets every patient with a smile and very informative about how to best protect your teeth.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have been to a few different dentists, and Dr. Seaton’s office is by far my favorite. Everyone is super nice and friendly, and I never have had a wait longer than just a couple minutes. Dr. Seaton is an amazing dentist and always makes sure his patients are comfortable. I also got my braces here. I have since gotten my braces off, and I am extremely happy with the results. I have zero complaints about my experiences here.< /review>

Walked in and staff was very friendly and welcoming. I’m afraid of dentist to start off with, but when I met Dr Seaton he made all things better. He’s very friendly and soft spoken. After my examination there was no more fear. He will be my dentist from now on.</text>

Always a pleasure with staff, yet this time around my daughter came out upset because one of the assistants was very rude during her cleaning. She was extremely shocked cause this had never happened before. She said the only bright spot was when Dr. Seaton came in to say high and see how she was doing. He was not even the one working on her but took the time to actually show some compassion.<//Text>

<review>This office is the best. I trust the doctors to keep my teeth happy and healthy. This is the first time a dentist could numb me without any pain from the injection. Dr. Seaton clearly described what was wrong with my tooth and fixed it in the same visit. Fast, painless, and friendly.< /review>< Pics>

Okay this is by far the best place ever!!! I usually HATE going to the dentist because I always have a bad experience! Every dentist I go to says “you won’t feel a thing” and it ALWAYS ends up being a lie! Well not here !! Dr. Seaton is the best dentist I’ve met! He actually means it when he says you won’t feel pain! The staff here was unbelievably nice and welcoming! I came in today for a tooth extraction, and I didn’t even feel when he took it out! When he said we were done in my head I thought what there’s no way!! I definitely recommend coming here for any tooth extractions and just in general! Dr. Seaton is great at what he does and the staff here is unmatchable anywhere else! This was the best staff I’ve met literally anywhere! Thank you Dr. Seaton! You’re the best! I was definitely pleased with my visit!<//Review>

< review>
My dentist of 27 years retired so I needed to find an experienced dentist that I could feel comfortable with. Several of my friends highly recommended Dr. Seaton. The minuet I walked through the door I felt I had made the right choice. Everyone was friendly, organized and professional. The office was very clean and everyone was taking precautions to protect my health and theirs. After a complete set of X-rays and photos Dr. Seaton came in sat down and just talked like we had known each other for a long time. He really made me feel comfortable. We talked about our families and growing up in Los Banos. After, he examined my teeth and gums we discussed what would need to be done. He explained everything in detail so I know what to expect and how it will be done.  I'm glad I took my friends advice.
Thank you DR. Seaton, Hannah, and the entire staff.
Sincerely,
Joseph Briozo
Los Banos, Ca.< /review>

Dr. Seaton is hands down best Dentist and Orthodontist ever. His work and attentiveness on perfection with Ortho/Dental for my all four of my kids ages 27 to 17 and myself just the best! All my kids have that perfect Colgate smiles, their teeth have never shifted after braces into adulthood so far. He has opened his office for us on weekends when my kids have had emergency needs with their teeth. Returning our calls at night with our concerns and issues.. He is just awesome 😎. Then the other half is the office and staff, always helpful. It was like visiting family when I would go to appts. Never never had issues with billing, appt times, getting us in last minute. Trisha is just hands down, awesome. Everyone in the office, we just love love our Dentist Family.< /Text>

I still don't understand why they ask me if I feel any pain getting novocaine shot.   In all my years there I have never felt any pain.< /Review>

Another great experience getting my teeth cleaned.
It's nice to have a very professional office here in Los Banos.

Consistently professional, safe from COVID, experience.

I've been going to Dr. Seaton for 21 years now.
His staff is friendly and kind.  I get a cleaning every three months! 🦷🪥😁<//Text><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

Dr. Seaton is a wonderful dentist with a great "bedside" manner. He always makes sure his patients are comfortable. I had a procedure today which required anesthetics. I felt nothing during the procedure including the injection of anesthetic. Our family has been seeing Dr. Seaton for many years now. Very highly recommended!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I am pleased with the service provided by Dr. Seaton and his team. This clinic has adjusted to Covid-19 and majority of the forms are filled online (which is really great!). Dr. Seaton is very informative and answers all questions regarding one's teeth and oral health. I usually go out of town for all my dental needs but will make all of my my future appointments here. I will be recommend all of my family members to go here for all of their dental work. Also, scheduling the appointment, as a new patient, was really easy!</review>< pics>

<Review>Each and every interaction I’ve had with the staff here I’ve been treated amazingly. The dental staff along with the administration are extremely attentive and respective of health guidelines(COVID-related) and are amazing at building rapport(you’d be amazed how this is lacking in general within a potentially scary thing like visiting the dentist).

Dr. Bendes and Dr. Seaton were both efficient in their methods and explained everything in detail regarding the work I needed done.

If you’re nervous or apprehensive about finding a permanent local dentist, don’t hesitate to come here.

I’ve personally been trying to straighten my teeth with braces, and having an amazing Doctor like Dr. Seaton has been the best experience ever! My teeth look AMAZING and his stuff makes me feel like I’m at home everytime I go into that office.

< review>
I've been going to Doctor Seaton for 9 year's. He and his staff r very , very nice and accommodating. As for Dr. Seaton he is very honest . I've been to other dentist in the pass and  they were always trying to adjust my bite. I think they were making holes so they can charge later to fill them. Dr. Seaton always gives u an option, for a example if u r teeth r sensitive he either says he can do some kinda of dental work or u can use a sensitive toothpaste. Most dentist never give u a choice. Highly, highly recommend
Dr Seaton.<//review>

<Text>After having a terrible experience lasting over 4 months at my previous dentist, coming to see
Dr. Seaton was the best thing I could have ever done.  He truly is an expert in his field and explained in great detail what needed to be done and the options I had to fix my root canal. The surgery was painless and Dr. Seaton fixed 4 months of work in 3 weeks and I am forever grateful. He and all his staff are the best! They made me feel that I have been coming here for years. They have gained a patient for life and make the 3 hour drive worthwhile. I highly reccomend if you read this that you come here. They will treat you like family and you will not be disappointed. To everyone at Benjamin J. Seaton, DDS, thank you so much!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Beyond happy!
I was in a lot of pain and they were able to squeeze me in to get seen. The staff is very friendly and Seaton is amazing. He explained to me everything he was going to do and the reasons to why he was going to do those things. He was constantly checking to make sure I was okay. Great place it's worth the cost and I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone I can. LOVED IT!!!!!<//Text>

Horrible!! If you have never been let me tell you they are crazy over booked. Took my son in for his apt,He was numb then they came back 40 min later to work on him he said it hurt so the Dr. referred him to a different office. He has had plenty of work done before never did he ever give them trouble he just didn't want to deal with giving him extra time/lidocaine because they had other patients waiting. We are never coming back!  Oh and that was not everything my daughter had a filling done and it came out the next day. SMH<//review>

<Name>Marlene Milosevich<//Name><Text>I have just finished a two stage root canal with Dr. Seaton and I couldn't be happier.  Root canal and happy are seldom if never used in the same sentence but my first contact with Dr. Seaton and his office was as a person with a full blown abscessed tooth in desperate need of assistance.  I'd never been in their office as a client but Tricia got me in that day ( I found out later they were booked up for 2 months in advance).  Dr. Seaton thoroughly explained my situation, the procedures necessary to resolve the problem and answered my questions.  I was on antibiotics by that evening.  Because of the seriousness of the infection the root canal had to be done in two stages.  Both times they were able to work me into their busy schedule.   I had allowed this situation to occur because my long time Dentist had retired and I had not determined to who I would go next.   I found both Dr. Seaton and his staff to be kind, considerate and knowledgeable with the comfort of the client their priority and his skill as a dentist superb.  By the end of the first stage of the root canal, I was so pleased ( and relieved at having that abscess drained and cleaned ) I made an appointment for my regular check up and cleaning for January which if I had done this earlier would have avoided getting the abscess in the first place.  As for the cost of the procedure,  on doing research I found it was well within the accepted range but as stated before, I could of avoided the pain and discomfort of an abscess had I just kept up with regular checkups which I will from now on with Dr. Seaton.< /Text><user>113897083332407074350< /user>< Pics>

Poor service and lazy workers who think they are too busy.  Walked in twice for loft and lie check but worker said he didn't know how to do it and I would have to leave the clubs for 10 days because they're backed up.  I will not waste my time going in there.</Text>

The golf team professionals at golf mart are at the highest standards ever. Once again they have taken care of my golf equipment issues with no questions, just took care of things. I've purchased clubs, shoes, drivers, clothes everything related to golf, from this store. And that will never change.</text>

Today decided to just check out what Golf Mart offered in a set of clubs. Luckily got hooked up with sales rep Brandon B, who was very knowledgeable and offered many combinations of shafts/club heads. Brandon patiently assisted me with the right choice, so decided to purchase a set of new clubs. Would like to thank Brandon for his excellent customer service and will definitely be back!< /Text>

Picking up golf, bought my first ever set. Bought a set of second hand Ping golf clubs there, consisting of only iron 5-9 and wedges L,U , but staff entered that there is a pitching wedge too in the receipt. Did not realized that until when I want to trade in. When I went to trade in the clubs, the shop stated that they can't trade in the club because it is not a full set since it is missing the pitching wedge. So first I paid for a set that is supposed to have a pitching wedge, but they short changed me and did not give me that. Then, I suffered from not being able to trade in because of their mistake, which they have no intention to correct it. Very poor experience for someone new to golf. Dishonest in sales.</Text>

Great selection of all things golf. Clothes, bags, clubs, shoes and any accessory you might want.  Staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Patrick helped me pick out the set of clubs that met my needs without blowing my budget.  They have a computer range set up and Patrick took the time to walk me through my options.< /Text>

<user_name>David Stahl<//user_name><Date>1532557182772< /Date><Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Seaside Golf Mart historically has been a great part of the Monterey Area golf community.  Unfortunately, something has changed over the last year.  Conducting business with this establishment is no longer a fun and pleasant process.  First, they recently tried to refuse replacing a grip even though they put on the wrong one.  They only agreed once they realized the grip was incorrectly put on anyways.  This was for a brand new club, so I guess there margin was not enough on the club itself.  They tried blaming me for the mistake.

Second, I brought in a pair of leaking shoes, still under warranty, and a different employee tried to argue that I had simply played too many rounds.  Number of rounds do not change the 2 year warranty policy, so not really sure why they were arguing.  I eventually received replaced shoes, but don't understand the argument.

Third, I have tied three times in the last month to get fitted for new irons.  I have money burning my pockets, but unfortunately, no one seems to have the time to help.  Either folks are taking breaks or are just too busy.  Ok, I see a bunch of folks doing nothing, or at least not revenue enhancing activities, yet they cannot find the time to fit me with new irons.  Hmm, don't get that either!

There are a few really good employees that work there, but this is no longer the establishment it once was.  I would recommend just finding what you want at the store and order it online.  You will probably get a better price.  Plus some of the online sites are even offering trial periods.

I am sad to write this review given the many years I enjoyed spending hours at Golf Mart.  The business approach worked because I have bought all my clubs there for the last 20 years.  No more!!!  Hopefully, management realizes what is happening soon before they lose too much business.

The pre owned selection is really nice. The staf is very helpful. You get to test the club's before you buy them.  It's basicly a one stop shop for all your golf needs< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) All kinds of branded golf balls and surrounding goods are sold, but it is necessary to ask whether the special offer is second-hand or brand new.

(Original)
各種品牌球具及周邊商品都有賣，不過要問明特價商品是否為二手貨或全新。</Review><Rate>3<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

I was quickly seen by Dr. Salkinder after my arrival and completion of paperwork. He explained what he was going to do, performed his tests, and provided the results.  He explained the results to me, then I was on my way.  Even the parking was easy.  The worst part was having to drive in Los Angeles traffic to get to him, but that is not his fault.< /text>

I normally don’t like people working on the inside of my ears, but this Doctor did an amazing job. Also the best price. He was very determined to fix the issues I was having, by cleaning out the wax in my ears that was causing me not to be able to hear. Definitely the best Doctor if you’re having hearing issues.</text>

<review>This place is great. I've been seeing this Dr for three years now. He's my go-to guy for botox, fillers and laser treatments for my acne scarring. (The laser treatments helped A LOT!). I'm very pleased with the level of service and pricing. He also seems like a good person. Highly recommend this place!</review>< pics>

<Text>I get sick on Christmas Eve... Sharp pain in my ear.
It was almost a miracle to found out that Dr. Salkinder had availability the same day.
He has very polite and friendly front office staff. I traveled from Encino to Los Angeles and was surprise how kind and respectful was the staff and the doctor by himself.
Dr. Salkinder very quickly detected the cause of my problem and prescribed me needed medication which helped me tremendously.
Overall, very good service. I highly recommend it!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

<Text>I did IPL for the first time . I choose this doctor because I observed how he was treated my mother with respect and compassion for medical condition.
Prior to procedure doctor explained everything what the procedure was about, including how I would feel afterwards and what to expect . He took pictures prior to it. Procedure went smoothly ; since I was wearing glasses , doctor explained every step what he was about to do. After procedure I was offered ice roller to help with discomfort along with detailed explanation what to expect and how long brown spots will persist. Overall I m very pleased with doctor. He was knowledgable , caring and taking time to make me comfortable . Just waiting  for now to see benefits on my face .
Highly recommend this doctor</Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I've been here twice now and can say that Dr Salkinder is very thorough and makes sure I feel comfortable the entire procedure, and seems like he genuinely cares. It is a Russian-friendly clinic, but I still felt very comfortable being the only non Russian in the waiting room!<//review>

I'm so exhited!  I finally have a waistline!!!  My whole life I"ve struggled with that little extra something around my midsection.  Not enought to resort to  desperate measures, like painful and expensive lipo, but just enough to be self-consious and uncomfortalble in a bikini...
Don"t get me wrong,  I'm #thin, #fit, I take care of myself.  I #exersize regularly, but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get rid of my soft middle.
Dr. Salkinder performed #Sculptsure on my lower abdominal area and sides.  Painless and quick.  25 min per area.  I was in and out in under an hour and back to work.  It's been just over 10 weeks (full results appear in 12 weeks).  No change in my exersize and diet.
I LOST NEARLY 2 DRESS SIZES IN MY MIDDLE!!!
There are finally fitted dresses in my future!!!  #Sculptsure changed my figure and my #selfesteem!
THANK YOU DR. SALKINDER!!!

Cant get past the receptionist who asks me to hold when trying to make an appointment. How infuriating. Moving on to the next doctor.</text>

I arrived hungry and ready. Inside a small cozy spot with a warm welcoming homey feel, grandmas kitchen. My first time here, and the staff was pleasant in explaining the different types of dishes.

I ordered a freshly made watermelon drink to start, it arrives quickly and it was perfectly refreshing - not too sweet.

I order the Mole Neigro "Dark Mole", and to my delight it was the perfect spicy note. I was making yummy sounds.... it was that good. It comes with freshly made tortillas, a side of rice, and a salsa cup for additional heat, if needed. My tongue and lips are buzzing with the heat, but I can't stop eating. Sipping my watermelon drink with this delicious mole, I am in a very happy food place right now.

This place might look like a hole-in-the-wall, but when I close my eyes while enjoying the food - I am in my grandmas. I see myself dangerously visiting this awesome restaurant multiple times a month.

I highly recommend everyone to give this Restaurant a chance,  you will not be disappointed.  Cash only place!</review>

<Review>I never take the time to review anything, but I want to be honest and help other not to make the same mistake. Husband and I traveled 30 min to try this restaurant, we made our choice based on the reviews and we were very disappointed. Food wasn't good at all. Rice tasted old. Food was cold when it got to our table. We regretted spending our Saturday night at this restaurant. Don't choice this place!<//Review>< user>

The language on the menu (names of dishes) is interesting. The service is good as both Spanish and English is spoken. The food was a bit bland but not bad, just ordinary.<//Review></record>

Horrible experience... in the mojarra the organs of the fish was still inside the fish. I returned it and told them if they can clean the fish but when they returned the fish it was burned. Worst experience.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Very good food and bread but the service is somewhat slow the place is small and cozy somewhat expensive for my taste and the food lacks a little more flavor what I most like about the place is that it has many products brought from Oxaca

(Original)
Muy buena comida y pan pero el servicio es algo lento el lugar es pequeño y acogedor algo caro para mi gusto y ala comida le falta un poquito más de sabor lo que más me agro del lugar es que tiene muchos productos traídos desde Oxaca</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Today I bought Oaxacan tamales and I got home and they are all scraps and I paid 5 dollars for each one. Unfortunately I lived very far to be able to return the only thing that I would ask them is that before selling them they pay attention to what they sell so that it does not happen to another person

(Original)
Hoy compré tamales oaxaqueños y llegue a casa y están todos desechos y pague 5 dólares por cada uno . Desgraciadamente viví muy lejos para poder regresar lo único que les pediría es que antes de venderlos pongan atención en lo que venden para que no le pase a otra persona<//review><userid>105803438177249990351< /userid>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) .. very rich, my husband is from Oaxaca and he likes to come here, I love the wire with extra quesillo with a lot of sauce and the always freshly made tortillas. My husband likes black beans a lot because he feels he is eating them in his Oaxaca ... 100% recommended.

Recently I relocated from Hawaii to California and needed insurance on my vehicle. I spoke with Jose Guzman of Acceptance insurance in  Westminster, California. After providing my vehicle documents, I was approved and ready to drive in less than an hour. My experience with Acceptance insurance has been fantastic. They provided me with inexpensive insurance rates with prompt & professional service. With acceptance insurance I know I will be safe on California highways. Good value.< /Review>

Jose was extremely helpful. He got back to me very quickly got me insured and I was ready to hit the road in less than hour.  And at also my half the price of other quotes I had gotten.   Update! I just insured a second vehicle with Jose! This time was just as smooth and within 30 minutes I was insured.<//review>

In all honesty, the customer service that was provided by Jose Guzman, the agent/representative, truly efficient, fast and easy. No hassles whatsoever!  I definitely recommend him highly. He does follow up. Especially if you agree to rate his service. This he will definitely follow up on. 🤣<//Review>

I just wanted to start off by saying Lisa here... Has helped me out sooo much in sooo many ways! I love how she always lets me know that if she feels she would have a problem with an insurance company doing it to her, she wouldn't want it done to me. Always helps me find the best price for my car at renewal. Goes above and beyond to make sure I am well taken care of, insured, and most importantly happy with the service I have received.<//review>

Lisa gives great support! To be honest I was a little unsure about which agency I should go to, I called Lisa she was able to give me affordable quotes and was able to answer the questions I had.

I came into acceptance auto insurance 2 minutes before closing and surprisingly, Lisa welcomed me in, willing to still help me out despite the time. I was shocked by how comforting my experience was here with her. She was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed without rushing. I was very pleased with my results!!!</Review>

When you turn in a payment online they always ask you for Account Number not Micr number. I have been continually disappointed by this bank. They have cost me multiple fees from the IRS due to their inconsistent system. I had a payment that needed to go through to the IRS and Sesloc declined it because Sesloc expects you to just know you’re supposed to put in MICR number not Account Number when every online payment forms online asks for the account number of your financial account. It’s a faulty system and we will be banking from somewhere else from now on. This is the last of many many issues I’ve had with this bank.< /text>

<Review>They have changed their hours so many times during 2020. Closing a 4pm makes it impossible for a working adult to make it in, before they close. They are only open 6 hours a day M-F and closed on weekends. How is anyone supposed to get anything done? They make you take your hat off when you go inside or you will not be served. It’s honestly ridiculous. They take my money every month no problem. But every time I need something, it’s nothing but problems.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80ecf0be25507e0b:0xe3a91416fb56df8e</gmap_id></record>

Friday=payday.
After my closing shift at work, I frantically drove to the bank hoping to make it in time to deposit my check. I was greeted with smiling eyes by a teller named Ben .S, who's attitude was hands down the best I have seen in quite awhile. He was genuine, friendly, and made me laugh even during these crazy times we are all going through.
Overall, this small errand that stressed me out, became an enjoyable experience. I walked out with a smile on my face.
Thank you Ben for are your help!</text>

I just opened an account after six years of painful interactions and incompetence at another major credit union in the area. The process, professionalism and helpfulness of my customer representative was amazingly simple, clear and she followed with everything we'll need to move all of our business accounts there as soon as possible. I'm completely regretting not acting on my dissatisfaction with my current credit union several years ago.</review>

I came to SESLOC because I was having problems with Rabobank. It is a night and day difference. I do my regular banking here, and had an auto loan also. Everyone at SESLOC is friendly, helpful, and many remember my name. They have much more convenient hours than a traditional bank, they make things easy to understand, and they are a big part of our community. One time I had a very long wait time on the phone, and when my call was answered, I got an apology and an explanation that they had received tons of calls, and since they are fairly small, they don’t have a huge call center. That also means, however, that your call is answered by someone you could have met when you went into the branch. I feel much better about my money being handled by a business based in my hometown. I can’t help but feel as though anyone who doesn’t give SESLOC a 4-5 star rating has never actually dealt with them!< /text>

I was given 2 wrong account #'s on my direct deposit authorization forms twice by Sesloc to give to my employer. Due to that mistake, I didn't receive my paycheck in a timely manner and my employer had to manually write me a replacement check that I needed to pick up from Santa Barbara or have mailed a few days after I was expecting my paycheck. I finally got my direct deposit when I gave my employer the information myself. Not having my direct deposit when it was suppose to be in there was really stressful due to bills that needed to be paid. It caused me to have fees added to my account and Sesloc refused to reverse them.  Tellers need better training to verify that information on the forms is correct.</review>

<Review>I've been banking with SESLOC for 10+ years, and had excellent service. We've opened multiple accounts, including several for our kids, made many wire transfers & inter-account transfers, no problems.

When it comes down to it, the biggest reason to choose a local credit union is this: SESLOC isn't trying to suck your money out and funnel it to corporate shareholders like major commercial banks; they're locally run, and they're a credit union, meaning that *you* are the shareholders. I honestly don't understand the appeal of a commercial bank, and I'm somewhat baffled by the number of Americans that use Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. etc. etc.

TL/DR: SESLOC is awesome.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1551207588706, 'text': 'Hi John -- thank you for this review, and thank you for "Bringing it Home" to SESLOC!'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

4/11/19 - follow up
Did receive an email back from the info email. I had asked if a manager could call me. This revolves around me waiting a week + to hear back my rep already. After 4 days I was told my info was being sent to a manager for a call. So it’s been 6 days since I requested a manager contact me because a rep was too busy to get back to me within a week.

I’m at a loss for words.

4/5/19 - follow up to post from yesterday:
It is nice to see that I got a response on here but the gesture feels hallow. Now I am a 1 star.

1. I emailed info and asked for a manger to call me today. No reply

2. Followed up with their home loan person via email. To offer a second chance very poor response.

I’m going to wait till next week to see if anything changes.

If not I’ll likely just share my communications with the home loans employee so others can see what the experience of dealing with SESLOC looks like and will be closing my account.

——
I’m really pained to put a poor review in public but I can’t find an email address for a bank manager and I see that someone from the bank is replying to posts. I really should put 1 star but I still wish SESLOC would live up to the reviews friends in the community give it.

SESLOC has three strikes with me

1. NON RESPONSIVE TO HOME LOAN REQUEST
I guess they don’t want to try and offer me a home loan. Cherise Long was so nice when I spoke to her in the bank in November but last week she let me know I am a low priority for her. I’ve waited over a week and am making my second offer on a home and still she has not reached back out to me. Fortunately two other lenders got back to me same day. Cherise let me know I needed to wait till the start of the month since I’m only a prospective loan not a real borrower. April 4th and still not even a reply. I guess $500k isn’t worth their time.

2. HARD CREDIT CHECK AGAINST MY WISHES
Hard credit check when I declined the banks request. I won’t even go into the details of this only to say I wanted to get an auto loan and like the home loan no one got back to me before I bought the car. After buying the car they called for approval to run my credit and I said no. They ran it anyways dinging my credit because 2 other lenders had already run my credit for the auto loan on the car I already bought.

3. THEY DIDN’T WANT MY MONEY
Opening the account. Again will try to keep short. Opened my account enthusiastically as I really wanted to move my money from Wells Fargo to SESLOC. Wells Fargo offers me some benefits for having a relatively larger account. When I asked if SESLOC had anything (I would have been sold on the local credit union aspect or the higher interest rate) I was encouraged to only open the account with $10. I basically had to force them to take the money I brought with me to open the account.

——

All that to say I would love to support a local credit union. I would love to support SESLOC. I would love to borrow money from SESLOC but I guess SESLOC isn’t interested.< /review>

<Text>The one presiding problem with SESLOC's loan process is that the loan application representatives ASSUME all loans, including certificate of deposit secured loans, require a credit check. This, of course, lowers your credit score with each inquiry. I believe SESLOC doesn't train these representatives with sufficiency so they can answer the question with some measure of competency. In my last application process with them, it took the loan representative over an hour to come back to me with an answer on the credit pull issue. That question should have been answered within 5 minutes of the interview.<//Text>< pics>

Friendly folks. Willing to assist a traveler with an account at a "sister" bank without a local SLO branch. Bent over backward to help me solve a serious banking issue and there was nothing in it for them...just nice people! If I lived in San Luis Obispo this is where I would be banking!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>My husband is the one in the family the does all of our banking needs. However, he is on vacation. This morning I got a phone call from my son needing money transferred into his account. Luckily, my husband is very organized and I quickly found all our account numbers. Still, I was extremely nervous about making this phone call because of my lack of experiences with banking matters. To my joy, I got Kathryn on the phone and she was spectacular! I can not adequately put into words how remarkable Kathryn was to me. She took care of all my needs and did so without any judgement. She quickly understood that she had someone on the phone that wasn't confident and she did not hesitate for one second to help ease my nerves. She even gave me excellent advice regarding my other accounts. SESLOC has been our banking partner since the late 1970s. Our family has always depended on their services and have never, ever been disappointed. I am grateful for their wonderful services. A huge THANK YOU to Kathryn!< /Text>< Pictures>

5th time I've called to talk to a representative, get greeted with an automated response, choose the appropriate number to speak with a teller, music plays for a moment while I'm on hold.....and then the call ends.... what the heck?!?! There truly is no way to actually talk to a person except in person. I expect to be moving away from this faulty union soon. I really wish I didn't have to... can't you guys just be better?</Text>

<Review>I have left the country twice now, and done everything I was suppose to to set up my account and I was locked out BOTH times. As a woman traveling by herself, having access to money is important and the lack thereof could be dangerous.

Then when I came back to the states and went to log into my account you needed to put in a security code to log into the account, that can ONLY be sent to a phone number and not to an email. The number on my account was the one I had before I started traveling so it needed to be changed. I called in, only for that to turn into a huge hassle.

I'm closing my account with them right now. No person should have that much difficulty getting access to their own money.<//Review>< UserId.>

The San Luis Obispo location is awesome. My account had this weird login problem people hadn't seen before and Jerry the Epic fixed it. He was very positive, friendly and funny as well as extremely helpful and answered all my questions with easily understood answers. I learned a lot more about my account today than when I did creating the account a year ago. I wish he had been the one to sign me up! So yeah, if you're having a really weird account issue ask for Gary. He'll do you right. I'm going to ask for him every time now.</Review>

The woman who called me to tell me the final disicion wasn't even involved in the process and couldn't answer any questions,nor would she transfer me to the people who could help.
All in all I was very dissatisfied with the whole experience .
I have also been trying to close my account with them for over a year but they don't seem to understand even how to do that.<//text>< Name>

Been banking here for over 25 years used to be a  great community bank now they are just like every other big bank with worst customer service. In fact some of their recent policy changes are worse than the big banks. Used to not charge little fees and hold checks when you had money in your account enough to cover the check. Know lots of fees and bad customer service sometimes down right rude. You can tell all the changes have come from the top down all in the name of profit. It's a shame to lose what was part of "old" San Luis Obispo but I guess that is progress just like everything else we are losing in this town. I no longer recommend Sesloc as a personal banking solution. You may as well go with a big bank and get the convenience of national presence.<//text>

I have banked with SESLOC since 1999 and have always banked with credit unions. I have both personal and business accounts with SESLOC. I agree with the reviews about service, friendliness, and meeting the needs of customers all going downhill, especially in the last two years. They have become completely non-accommodating to customer needs, more bureaucratic and harder to access. I would not be banking with them if it wasn't such a hassle to change all of the insurance companies and businesses I work with to a different bank. I plan on switching to a local bank in the future.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I have been a customer for 20 years, with my corporate and personal accounts. About 2-3 years ago, something changed about the management. I was told they got a new president or operations manager. I was asked to completely resubmit my business documentation. When I went in to give it to them, there were huge piles of paperwork from other businesses sitting around the bank office. Anyone could have read them. When I asked the customer service representative what was going on, she looked around and rolled her eyes, and shrugged her shoulders. I got the clear sense it was useless work, and that she was completely overwhelmed with the management requests she was getting for yet more paperwork from businesses and account holders. They said they were getting all of this documentation again for my business’s security and to comply with banking regulations. All I can say is that I have been dealing with getting them more and more paperwork and signatures, and corporate minutes, and more and more and more... and it never ends. I just got another call saying that something else hadn’t been signed. That makes at least 15 calls in the last 3 months.
I was told that we could no longer authorize transfers between business and personal accounts over the phone, even if I am the 100% owner of both accounts. Asked them why, after 20 years of making easy transfers between accounts, it was now impossible to do. They told me it was because of the “new banking regulations”. They then admonished me when I didn’t want to come in with a physical check to move money between my accounts. Really? I have to drive all the way to their branch to move money between my accounts with a physical check???
Went over to Wells Fargo, and they have the same new banking regulations but seem to have zero problem making these transfers for me over the phone. All of my accounts at Wells Fargo are easily linked online, and I can transfer as much or as little as I want of my own money. What it is, I was told by Wells Fargo, is that Sesloc doesn’t have the money to pay to program their system for the new regulations. They use a generic system that can’t allow for separating ownership of business and personal accounts that are not 100% owned and those that are.
As for importing transactions into quickbooks, sesloc has a convoluted system where I have to sort the transactions first, and then download a file that uploads into quickbooks. From there, I have to type in every transaction category by hand, instead of auto-sorting based on existing transactions. My Wells Fargo account simply uploads easily, and the known transactions easily code for me. Hours of time saved.
My payroll used to be easy because I could transfer money into my employee’s accounts. Since they redid their whole online banking system, it is not possible to do this anymore. I have to set it up some convoluted way. What a pain.
Lastly, I was looking for a corporate line of credit. I thought since I was a 20 year customer, my business would qualify me. It turns out sesloc just doesn’t do any business financing at all. Wells Fargo has the most business loan options of any bank.
Why can’t this small town bank get it’s act together. It can’t be that hard. Why did everything change 2-3 years ago, when other banks do not have the same problems or requirements?
Can’t think of any way to justify using Sesloc anymore, and I was really a fan for years.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Their customer service has gone down an unbelievable amount since I started banking with them however many years ago.  I just moved to Chico last month and am in the process of trying to move everything over to a local CU here, SESLOC has done nothing but make it a terrible experience.
I was told they would put a hold on my account during this process so that I wouldn't have any unexpected charges from forgotten auto pays, only to have to fight with them when they let a bunch of things hit that cause me NSF fees. It was like pulling teeth to get their fees removed. I have called them multiple times to try to find out the status of my account, only to be given wishy washy conflicting answers and get nowhere.  I then report my account being compromised due to stolen checks but they will not even place a hold/freeze on my compromised account without me physically going into their location. They want me to make a 12 hour round trip just for that.
I have literally NEVER had such a terrible customer service experience with any company, let alone one that I have been trusting with my money for all these years. I never thought I would say this, but I would even recommend BofA above them.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>We went in to talk about first time home buying and open an account. The woman who helped us with the account was fine. The woman who "helped" us with questions about loans was NOT fine.  She told us right of the bat she was going to lunch but could answer just a few questions for us. She was short on her answers, and we felt like she stereotyped our family (we have three young kids) to the point where she felt we would not even qualify with out knowing anything about us. We will not be going there for our home loan.< /review>< pictures>

I have been a member since about 1988 or 1989 when I started attending Cal Poly SLO. I've never had any problems with SESLOC, and I do all of my banking through them. I receive direct deposits and pay my bills through them without a hitch. I'm not sure why some of the reviewers here have problems; I think they must not understand it, because it works perfectly well. I love the new location. I was used to going to the Los Osos Valley Road location, which is actually *a little* closer to my house, but since all the big box stores arrived plus the construction on Hwy. 101 there tends to be a lot of congestion in that area. I welcome the new location, and I've quickly adapted working the new location into my errand running routine. Besides, I rarely have to go to the physical location since I mostly do things on my mobile devices. Speaking of, the app is pretty great. The only thing lacking from the mobile apps that I've personally encountered was being able to add a memo to transfers like you can from the regular website.<//text>

WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS BANK?????

In the last 4 weeks I have had  3 MAJOR ELECTRONIC errors with this bank.

JUST CANT TRUST THEM ANYMORE - staff doesn't care and managers are cold.

----------------

I have been banking with this bank for 20 YEARS.  It is only recently that I have decided to take 8 accounts elsewhere.

1. Was told over the phone that I needed to set up a regular wire or direct transfer with a representative and couldn't do it over the phone.  Walked into the bank to do a regular account transfer to another sesloc account - sat down with a representative - spent 40 minutes with the particulars - signed a piece of paper agreeing to the transfer.
Money never transferred. Staff couldn't find paperwork (lost).  Gave me a ton of excuses and every sesloc employee seemed to have a different reason why their site wasn't working or why transfers are not going through.

2.  Replacement Credit Card / expiration date

Spoke with 9 different representatives!!!!! to get a replacement credit card that never came in the mail.  Right at Christmas time my card was set  to expire.  Called 1st week of December confirming the details, ....my address ("everything set right?") "oh yes sir everything is done it's already shipped".   Again it took 9 different employees to tell me it shipped, it didn't ship, it never shipped,  it's on the way.... no it's not on the way...this time it's on the way....my manager says its not on the way.  Finally after Christmas was over (didn't have a credit card during Christmas time)   - my card was now expired- .  Begging the bank for another card finally they shipped one finally got it like 1-2 weeks into January.  What a joke.

3.  Doing a website transfer ? (MONEY POOF - GONE!)

Tried to do a inner Sesloc transfer this morning.  Imagine you click to transfer your money into another account and the money evaporates before your eyes.  Nothing at the arriving account - and nothing at the sending account.

Um called their staff. Spoke with Jim - yes sir looks like a website error.  We'll need management approval to put the money back in your account.  Um hello?  How about - I'M the freaking manager of money.  PUT IT BACK IN MY ACCOUNT.  It will take approximately 30 minutes.  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.  Hours later.  "what the heck is going on"  Finally got a hold of Daisy- apparently manager at the bank?  She was cold and patronizing.   "It was approved by a manager, just waiting for the funds to be transferred back"

Why am I getting treated like YOUR bank is doing me a favor for keeping my money with you.

SESLOC DISASTER - YOU USED TO BE SO GOOD! BEST IN SLO.  JUST TERRIBLE!< /Text>< Pics>

In my experience, SESLOC customer service has greatly declined in the past five years.  Increasingly, they have gotten more difficult to access - closing branches that were close to us and opening up in other areas that are not at all convenient - at least to us.  They have started to institute banking policies that are inconvenient and impersonal - for example, refusing to let me transfer money from savings to checking on line, because I was only allowed to do make six online transfers in one month (they never told me this before and the first five transfers were automatic transfers that they had initiated - not me!).  I was trying to make the online transfer to make sure I had sufficient funds to cover a check - and I had to drive all the way down to their very inconvenient office (a half hour from my home) to make the transfer in person. Their new branch office is ugly, poorly planned, wasteful of space, and very impersonal.  I have transferred my banking to US Bank, which despite being a very large bank, is so much more personal than SESLOC.  So sorry to see a credit union we have used for over 15 years become such an impersonal, bureaucratic nightmare.</text>

<text>Attitude. I went in today to discuss loan options and the man helping me. Killiam or something was rude and very short with me  when I had called to discuss these options before I was told a very different story than what I was being told and he was very rude about what I had to say.
I had wanted to completely change banks and needed to switch over my accounts and credit accounts.
Oh well. I'll be looking at other credit unions. My husband and I were very displeased.< /text>< Pics>

< review>
The former comments about good service are outdated.  Between their new, NOT improved bill pay system put into play last Sept. and their move to their new location, I consider it 'the icing on the cake' of down-spiraling customer service.  Closed the branch at Cal Poly (saying we can use another credit union's ATM on campus), closed the branch on LOVR - that makes it quite a long trip out to their new location from my north coast home. I have ZERO reason to be in that area unless I'm taking a flight - I don't usually combine that with banking.  I called regarding some concerns I had about our account in particular and some issues with the new bill pay system.  No one of authority around to talk to so I left a message saying that I had some concerns about our account.  Never got a call back.  We have been members for 8 years and that is not how things used to be.< /review>

<text>Service was excellent from the first visit. Quote came within 48 hours as promised via email. I really liked how detailed and easy to read it was. Financing link In email was great, that was a pleasant surprise. They showed up on time and did a terrific job. Install was quick, clean and professional. Mike, who came out originally to do my estimate, called me the next morning to make sure I was happy with the install. A few days later I received care and maintenance instructions via email. All and all, I couldn’t be happier. Product and Customer Service are EXCELLENT!< /text><Rate>5< /Rate><time>1627758224636</time>< response>

<text>It was a pleasure working with Prolawn.  From the first phone call ( they answered right away) and were very informative and scheduled my free in home estimate right away. The salesman/estimator  Alonzo was so professional,on time, knowledgeable,patient and friendly.  The crew who did the prep and install were on time, professionally, efficient and great to work with. most of all I LOVE MY NEW YARD. The turf is better than expected. I would recommend them to all my friends and family.

Update 2: They sent someone to repair the section and add wood to help support the dirt.  Thanks!< /text>< Response>

<text>Our grass is amazing. The quality, the color, the look is perfect. Everyone who comes to our house comments on how real it feels and looks. Pro Lawn is very professional from the very start- from the time you call to arrange for an estimate, to the sales professional, then to the install team. They are able to clear explain every part of the process so there are no surprises along the way. I HIGHLY recommend Pro Lawn!<//text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a Retired General Contractor, and I also used to own and operate my own landscape company. And as such, I am pretty picky my home, and how it looks. (The Pictures I Provided Speak For Them Selves, my wife and I do all our own work on our home from painting, laying pavers to landscaping). So due to that, I am generally reluctant to let anyone else work on my home, as I want it to be done right. So when my wife suggested we start looking at artificial turf to replace our beautiful Marathon Sod Yard, due to the severe drought here in So Cal, I was quite hesitant to look at, and trust anyone In that business. As I have seen a lot of really fake looking yards in out neighborhood. And I have heard numerous horror stories of poor installs/workmanship, poor quality turf products, smelly turf due to pets etc. (I have 5 dogs) So I did my research, and set up 5 interviews/quotes with what I considered to be the best 5 prospects based on my research. After all the interviews, I chose to go with Pro Lawn, as Mike Clark their owner was by far the most professional of them all. Let me explain what I mean. 1. He was able to answer all my questions and concerns with facts. (not the other guys, I got a lot of maybes, and I'll have too ask someone else) 2. He was able to show me samples of all the products when he came to the appointment. He was prepared. (the others did not have complete samples) 3. I was able to discuss my whole plan with him, and get his feed back, as not only was he the owner, but he was very experienced in all phases of this type of construction. As he get's his hands dirty doing the work as well. (the other guys were sales people with nothing but a quote, and a desire to get a signed deal that day) 4. We only had 900 sq. feet to do. The other company's said it would take anywhere from 2 to 5 days, depending on how many guys they could send. Mike said they would be done in one day. He would have a four man crew coming. 5. Mike was never pushy in any way. He was very respectful of me and my home and what we were trying to accomplish. So based on those facts, who would you choose??? A no brainer, right. So yes, we choose Pro Lawn. Now I must admit, I was still a little apprehensive regarding the actual install, as I'm letting a group of strangers work on my home. But on the day of the install when the Pro Lawn crew showed up, and I met the foreman and his crew, all my doubts went away. First they were on time. They were dressed professionally for the task at hand. They had all the tool's and materials with them to do the job. They reviewed everything they were going to do and why, and asked for my input. And during the procedure, keep me in the loop 100%. There were no surprises. They were like military operation in their approach. No wasted energy or time. You could tell they really knew what they were doing. Everything they did from the sod removal to the install of the turf was well planned. No guess work. And they really took pride in how and what they were doing. They wanted us to like the results of their craft. They were very impressive to watch. We were amazed to say the least. That was in 2014. Here we are 4 years later, and our lawn still looks amazing. (With 5 Dogs Mind You) No issues. I took these pic's today, 3/3/2018. And yes, I would do it again in a heart beat. Thanks' to  Mike and his amazing team, my home looks amazing. I just got invited to be in the parade of gardens in Clairmont. I have people stop by all the time and take pictures and ask how we take care of the turf. I tell them I only use a blower. Hee Hee. Anyway, I could go on for ever about my wonderful experience. But I think you get the point. We are one happy customer. Tim & Leesa</Review>

< Review>
I had made the mistake of going with another vendor when I first decided to put in a putting green in my Temecula back yard. I loved the concept and loved it even more when it went in. But within six months it began to fall apart.  The seams were a nightmare, the cups uneven, and it was completely unsuitable for any kind of chipping at all. Finally I decided to do it right and called ProLawn. The quality is amazing. It's like night and day. Putts roll true and fast.  And I can hit flop shots from 30 yards and actually stop them on the green. The service was outstanding both before and after the installation. When I've had questions or concerns, the ProLawn team responds quickly and professionally.  Yes, it was a little more to go with ProLawn. But it was worth every penny.</Review>

Working with Mike and his team was a great experience. We are thrilled with how our project turned out! The entire process was easy and seamless. Mike made some recommendations we hadn't thought of, and his suggestions were on point. The folks at ProLawn Turf are knowledgeable, honest, and responsive. And it is not just us who love the new turf in our backyard - they get a paws up from our 4 dogs as well. I highly recommend!</Review>

This company is fantastic! They are experts in their profession. My husband wanted a putting green and we needed artificial turf around our newly built pool. We didn’t have much space for the putting green but they did a great job with 4 holes and slight elevations for challenges. I don’t know very much about golf but my husband does and he is elated. Everyone who has come by compliments our yard. Mike and his team were incredibly professional. Our job was done quickly without any issues. The work was beyond what we hoped for. We recommend this company to everyone.
Thank you again.

Mike Clark and his staff did an amazing transformation of our front yard. We gave him a rough sketch drawing of what we had in mind. He took pictures and measurements and made 3D renderings out of what we had in mind. His crew made our yard look even better than the 3D pictures. Our Yard is definitely a work of art and is by far the best yard in our neighborhood. Mike & his crew are not only professional at what they do but they are all personal with us the customer. Thank you Mike, Mark, & Brandon & the rest of the crew at Pro Lawn

The entire team was extremely hardworking, reliable, and values the customer. We had a tremendous landacaping  job that Mike and his team completed for us. As a military family trust in a new community is invaluable! I would highly recommend ProLawn. Our landscaping project was a water conservation landscaping and irrigation in both front and back yards to remove weeds and add turf, curbing replace with gravel/river rock/shredded bark, with the planting of 20+ new plants, a couple of trees and conversion to the drip line. The project was completed on time, with follow up, excellent materials and workmanship!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Service was excellent from the first visit. Quote came within 48 hours as promised via email. I really liked how detailed and easy to read it was. Financing link In email was great, that was a pleasant surprise. They showed up on time and did a terrific job. Install was quick, clean and professional. Mike, who came out originally to do my estimate, called me the next morning to make sure I was happy with the install. A few days later I received care and maintenance instructions via email. All and all, I couldn’t be happier. Product and Customer Service are EXCELLENT!< /Text><userid>115543164669645068113< /userid>< date>

It was a pleasure working with Prolawn.  From the first phone call ( they answered right away) and were very informative and scheduled my free in home estimate right away. The salesman/estimator  Alonzo was so professional,on time, knowledgeable,patient and friendly.  The crew who did the prep and install were on time, professionally, efficient and great to work with. most of all I LOVE MY NEW YARD. The turf is better than expected. I would recommend them to all my friends and family. See before and after photos< /Text>

The installation was great and quick. They literally did it in 1 day. For anyone putting in artificial turf near a vinyl fence, there is a high probability for the sun reflecting off the fence and burning away the turf.

Update: I have run into an issue about 3 months after installation with a section of dirt giving way below the turf.

Update 2: They sent someone to repair the section and add wood to help support the dirt.  Thanks!<//text>

Our grass is amazing. The quality, the color, the look is perfect. Everyone who comes to our house comments on how real it feels and looks. Pro Lawn is very professional from the very start- from the time you call to arrange for an estimate, to the sales professional, then to the install team. They are able to clear explain every part of the process so there are no surprises along the way. I HIGHLY recommend Pro Lawn!< /text>

< review>
Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a Retired General Contractor, and I also used to own and operate my own landscape company. And as such, I am pretty picky my home, and how it looks. (The Pictures I Provided Speak For Them Selves, my wife and I do all our own work on our home from painting, laying pavers to landscaping). So due to that, I am generally reluctant to let anyone else work on my home, as I want it to be done right. So when my wife suggested we start looking at artificial turf to replace our beautiful Marathon Sod Yard, due to the severe drought here in So Cal, I was quite hesitant to look at, and trust anyone In that business. As I have seen a lot of really fake looking yards in out neighborhood. And I have heard numerous horror stories of poor installs/workmanship, poor quality turf products, smelly turf due to pets etc. (I have 5 dogs) So I did my research, and set up 5 interviews/quotes with what I considered to be the best 5 prospects based on my research. After all the interviews, I chose to go with Pro Lawn, as Mike Clark their owner was by far the most professional of them all. Let me explain what I mean. 1. He was able to answer all my questions and concerns with facts. (not the other guys, I got a lot of maybes, and I'll have too ask someone else) 2. He was able to show me samples of all the products when he came to the appointment. He was prepared. (the others did not have complete samples) 3. I was able to discuss my whole plan with him, and get his feed back, as not only was he the owner, but he was very experienced in all phases of this type of construction. As he get's his hands dirty doing the work as well. (the other guys were sales people with nothing but a quote, and a desire to get a signed deal that day) 4. We only had 900 sq. feet to do. The other company's said it would take anywhere from 2 to 5 days, depending on how many guys they could send. Mike said they would be done in one day. He would have a four man crew coming. 5. Mike was never pushy in any way. He was very respectful of me and my home and what we were trying to accomplish. So based on those facts, who would you choose??? A no brainer, right. So yes, we choose Pro Lawn. Now I must admit, I was still a little apprehensive regarding the actual install, as I'm letting a group of strangers work on my home. But on the day of the install when the Pro Lawn crew showed up, and I met the foreman and his crew, all my doubts went away. First they were on time. They were dressed professionally for the task at hand. They had all the tool's and materials with them to do the job. They reviewed everything they were going to do and why, and asked for my input. And during the procedure, keep me in the loop 100%. There were no surprises. They were like military operation in their approach. No wasted energy or time. You could tell they really knew what they were doing. Everything they did from the sod removal to the install of the turf was well planned. No guess work. And they really took pride in how and what they were doing. They wanted us to like the results of their craft. They were very impressive to watch. We were amazed to say the least. That was in 2014. Here we are 4 years later, and our lawn still looks amazing. (With 5 Dogs Mind You) No issues. I took these pic's today, 3/3/2018. And yes, I would do it again in a heart beat. Thanks' to  Mike and his amazing team, my home looks amazing. I just got invited to be in the parade of gardens in Clairmont. I have people stop by all the time and take pictures and ask how we take care of the turf. I tell them I only use a blower. Hee Hee. Anyway, I could go on for ever about my wonderful experience. But I think you get the point. We are one happy customer. Tim & Leesa< /review>

< Review>
I had made the mistake of going with another vendor when I first decided to put in a putting green in my Temecula back yard. I loved the concept and loved it even more when it went in. But within six months it began to fall apart.  The seams were a nightmare, the cups uneven, and it was completely unsuitable for any kind of chipping at all. Finally I decided to do it right and called ProLawn. The quality is amazing. It's like night and day. Putts roll true and fast.  And I can hit flop shots from 30 yards and actually stop them on the green. The service was outstanding both before and after the installation. When I've had questions or concerns, the ProLawn team responds quickly and professionally.  Yes, it was a little more to go with ProLawn. But it was worth every penny.</Review>

Working with Mike and his team was a great experience. We are thrilled with how our project turned out! The entire process was easy and seamless. Mike made some recommendations we hadn't thought of, and his suggestions were on point. The folks at ProLawn Turf are knowledgeable, honest, and responsive. And it is not just us who love the new turf in our backyard - they get a paws up from our 4 dogs as well. I highly recommend!< /review>

This company is fantastic! They are experts in their profession. My husband wanted a putting green and we needed artificial turf around our newly built pool. We didn’t have much space for the putting green but they did a great job with 4 holes and slight elevations for challenges. I don’t know very much about golf but my husband does and he is elated. Everyone who has come by compliments our yard. Mike and his team were incredibly professional. Our job was done quickly without any issues. The work was beyond what we hoped for. We recommend this company to everyone.
Thank you again.

Very professional. From the first consultation meeting to installation day, ProLawn delivered high quality products and exceptional service. They were considerate of our time and resources and provided us with the necessary information so we would arrive at a decision and design that are both cost-efficient and practical. Thank you for the beautiful backyard our family will enjoy for years.<//Review>

Mike Clark and his staff did an amazing transformation of our front yard. We gave him a rough sketch drawing of what we had in mind. He took pictures and measurements and made 3D renderings out of what we had in mind. His crew made our yard look even better than the 3D pictures. Our Yard is definitely a work of art and is by far the best yard in our neighborhood. Mike & his crew are not only professional at what they do but they are all personal with us the customer. Thank you Mike, Mark, & Brandon & the rest of the crew at Pro Lawn

We had a tremendous landacaping  job that Mike and his team completed for us. As a military family trust in a new community is invaluable! I would highly recommend ProLawn. Our landscaping project was a water conservation landscaping and irrigation in both front and back yards to remove weeds and add turf, curbing replace with gravel/river rock/shredded bark, with the planting of 20+ new plants, a couple of trees and conversion to the drip line. The project was completed on time, with follow up, excellent materials and workmanship!<//text>< Pics>

Pro-Lawn did our backyard putting green and front yard turf and both look very nice. Although the putting green layout was difficult due to many curves in a narrow space, it came out beautiful.< /Review>

We have nothing but great things to say about everyone and everything with ProLawn Turf.  From the moment Mike came by to give us a quote, through talking with Kristie at the office and installation by the guys; this has been a most positive experience.  And, we LOVE our putting green!

Thank you for your care, customer service and product.  It makes us proud to be in Temecula!!<//text>

Went to get gas on the way home from my buddies house and when i pulled up to this shell gas station. I parked and tried use my card but it declined my card and told me to see cashier. So i went to the cashier. He didnt know how to put my reward in so at this point in
was frustrated. So I left and went to a different gas station. I filled up my tank and went home. I live a hour away. This was 11 at night that this happen. By the time I got home I had a email that said fraud alert and asked if I authorized my card for 125 to this gas station on 5/25 so well after midnight someone tried to use my card information. This gas station is compromised. I highly advise anyone not to use you card here because it will get stolen. Not sure if it's the people at the gas station itself or someone around there doing it because alot of suspicious cars were just hanging around parked off to the side. If you are going to go pay cash but I would advise not to go at all.<//text>

Absolutely DO NOT GO HERE. My card information was stolen after using it here. They make customers use the point of sales device inside, don’t offer cash back, and were harassing people in line for trying to pay cash in anything but close to exact change. Other reviewers have mentioned stolen credit information from this station so do not risk going here. I went on Sunday for a small purchase and my card information was stolen and used nearby. I have filed a complaint with Shell and will be filing one with the better business bureau.<//review>

<response>None<//response><Review>Extremely immature and rude gas station owner.

He refused to turn on the air even though I had purchased gas. He first lied and said "a truck is in the way, I can't turn it on until it moves" then when I asked if I had to pay even though by CA law it should be free he said "yes, give me the money and I'll turn it on."

And then when I asked him why he said he couldn't turn it on earlier. No joke, he put his fingers in his ears and started saying 'lalalala'. I asked why he was acting like a child, and he started waving and said "bye bye! So long! Go away!"

Ridiculous behavior. I will be filing a complaint with Shell.<//Review><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

Decent gas station. Fairly clean. It can be hard to get out of the gas station in heavy traffic due to its location.<//Review>

The customer service is excellent, along with the atmosphere. The food was savory and well-seasoned. One of our friends is a bread-a-holic and rated their bread one of the best he's ever had. Even the clam chowder was delicious! This is a must go. It's a little on the pricey side, but 100% worth it. Try the Salmon and lasagna. Enjoy!</text>< pictures>

Very cute little restaurant in the heart of Carmel. Outdoor seating feels like you’re in a treehouse with the elevated balcony. We were told to wait 20 minutes for a table but were seated almost immediately. Nice bathroom!

COVID wise: servers wore their masks but didn’t enforce guests at all. Tables were very close together with little to no distancing.

Menu was only 2 pages long but had a variety of cuisines such as burgers, thai curry, pastas, and spanish paella.<//text>

He helped us get our stroller up the stairs, and was very accommodating to our family. He stopped by our table to ask how the food was even though he was not our waiter. He was kind, happy, polite, professional, and extremely hospitable. We will go back just because this guy was great. Great service and great food.

The ambiance, outdoor seating, heaters, and lights were great. All around a 5-star place to dine.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

<review>Nice little place, perfect for a quiet fancy night. My group was fully vegetarian and we had to scrape the menu for veg food. The mushroom ravioli was delicious - a must try. We also had pasta and red thai curry, which were both just okay. The garlic bread was a pleasant surprise and I'd totally recommend it.<//review>< pics>

Amazing outdoor dining.  The Seafood Paella was a very large portion - perhaps meant for sharing.  The shrimp were giant!  Baklava was delicious and DH says they have the best Clam Chowder.  We came on a Friday late afternoon around 4pm and we were seated right away.  All employees were smiling under their masks (I could see it in their eyes)  It was perfect!< /review>

<Text>Excellent restaurant, unfortunately only takeout at present. Our take out dinner a couple of nights ago was very good. Probably the best lamb I have eaten in a very long time. The owner ws very pleasant and helpful. It's slightly on the pricier side, but typical of Carmel pricing, however the food was absolutely worth it. We will order again from them before we leave Carmel in a few days.

4/10/21 update.

Had the opportunity to visit this restaurant again, but this time for indoor dining.

My review thoughts have not changed. This is a very very good restaurant. The menu is quite eclectic, from Thai curry to steak to kebabs. I once again had the lamb kebabs, and once again they were outstanding.

The wait staff service was also very good.

Should be very high on any Carmel visitors restaurant dining list< /Text><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

<text>Treehouse was recommended by the sommelier at one of the wine tastings we went to. It was a great rec - small family-owned restaurant with a wide variety of food options. The family is consistently checking in on guests.

I got the lamb stroganoff and my partner got the shrimp pasta. Both were good, but would probably try something new off the menu next time! The sommelier highly recommended their curries. One of the best parts was oil mixture they served with bread and no corkage fee if you bring Scheid wine!</text><name>Sarah Good< /name><user>115010397869216064329< /user>< pics>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I visit a lot of restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very attentive and the cooking they serve is so delicious. I never miss an opportunity to have a good dinner in this restaurant. Highly recommended.</review>

Great location. Beautiful trees and the front garden is great. Came in only for a glasses wine on a Saturday night at 7:00. Obviously very busy. Friendly service and a good wine by the glass selection. Loved this place, will definitely be back.<//Text>

Last week was the first time we visited this magnificent restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the finest  dishes and fine drinks and with the comfortable price. We will definitely return there again.< /Review>

Perfect cozy atmosphere, off the main streets of carmel-by-the-sea. Their pasta is made fresh from a lil pasta spot right next door. The Spanish Paella was delicious! Finger-licking good. Perfectly paired with the dreaming tree wine. Also, we were lucky to be given free dessert. (Thank you, treehouse!) The baklava was beautiful! Loved our girls trip here. We'll definitely be coming back!<//Text>

Food ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Service ⭐⭐⭐
Personal Touch ⭐⭐

Restaurants are like love affairs. It doesn't have to be perfect, but some things will make it last.

We came from a far to visit this restaurant. We waited about 40 minutes for a table. Met Fadi, the Jordanian entrepreneur who owns the restaurant. Very pleasant.

The food was absolutely delicious. The sauces were just perfectly done, not overly creamy, just the right consistency. The food combinations were awesome.

The server didn't recommend any appetizers. Went from drinks to main course. When asked about the Ravioli special vs. the seafood pasta, he said he liked both but couldn't recommend one over the other. So I ordered both. Though the owner knew we came from a far and it was to celebrate a birthday, there was no effort to make the birthday girl's evening special.

The server only visited the table just once since the order. The owner didn't visit any tables while we were there.

We would have ordered dessert and wine had the service was better. This is where the relationship part come in. We would have gladly spent a lot more money, but went elsewhere for dessert and wine.

There was a table of 4 next to us who just had water, no dessert, but was googling where to go from there. Missed opportunity.

There are many great restaurants in Carmel. We come to Carmel often. We come for that special Carmel experience and service. I hope Fadi realizes that it's a privilege to have customers, not a privilege to eat at his restaurant. Make the customers feel amazing and they will return even if the food missed a beat that day or on that dish.

Great potential at this location and at this restaurant. Keep the kitchen staff, but change the attitude, spend more time taking care of your customers. Get to know them. They will come back. They will spend more money per check. They will be more forgiving.< /text>

Went there for an early lunch. Had Russian Lamb Stroganoff and See Food Pasta.  Both served over pappardelle pasta they are getting from a pasta shop next door. Great service too.  Will go back when we will be visiting Carmel next time.<//Review>

<text>We celebrated my birthday here. Daniel - our server has given us 5 stars service. He made us feel so welcomed. Excellent Mediterranean food, Greek salad was freshly made with care. The grilled calamari was so delicate( although I wished they actually would grilled it instead of battered it). Very delicious though.
The chicken kabobs was tender, juicy and very flavorful( I’m very picky when it comes to chicken kabobs). Treehouse Cafe got this down.I would come back again on my next trip.< /text>< Pictures>

First time in Carmel and friends recommended this place and it’s across from our hotel.
It was super yummy!! Had gyros for appetizer, seafood pasta and lamb kabobs - and baklava for dessert! Also had a glass of Sangria and I usually don’t enjoy red sangria but it was the best I’ve had!
They had us eat on patio upstairs which was beautiful! Would definitely recommend!!</Review>

The deck seating was just right for today with a warm sun and cool air. The fresh pesto was balanced and tasty, the stroganoff a great comfort-food choice. Be ready to walk off the meal afterwards!<//text>

<review>The Treehouse Cafe has exceptional chowder and the Thai sausage is delicious, too. We scored a bottle of fantastic red wine as well for a great discount. Service was great.< /review><Name>Jeremy A.< /Name>< Time>

Small and cute with lots of food options! They manage expectations with realistic waiting times. They'll also give you take out options instead of waiting about 30-45 min on a weekend (even a rainy weekend).</review>

<Text>What a darling little restaurant with amazing food! I didn't have high expectations and they blew me away. The bread is phenomenal. And the pasta bolognese and beef stroganoff were the best we've ever had!

Just as important as food was the ambience. You fill like you are sitting on a little rooftop in Europe. The service was friendly, quaint, and intimate.

Will definitely be back!< /Text>< Rate>

Good Greek style salad. Pesto Chicken sandwich was just ok. It was pretty dry. Not much pesto and big dry pieces of chicken breast. You will need a lot of water to get it down.< /review>

Just like the rest of the food that our group ordered. Very pleased, definitely coming here again on our next trip to Carmel.

Delicious!  I got the chicken pesto pasta, which was perfect.  Papardelle was done just right, the chicken was juicy and high quality, and the pesto sauce was terrific.  My wife got the dolmas, which she enjoyed, and my daughter got a huge cheeseburger which she devoured without complaint.  Service very friendly and attentive.  We didn't want to wait for outdoor seating, which looked really nice -- next time, though!< /review>

Treehouse Cafe is fantastic. The terrace is beautiful with the sound of a fountain in the background, La Vie en Rose on the surround sound, mimosa in hand with a prawns cessar salad for brunch. Doesn’t get much better than this on a sunny day in Carmel! Service, atmosphere, and food were wonderful.<//review>

<Review>Great food. They are working under their social distancing rules, and obviously trying hard. All the servers and bussers wear masks.

I recommend making a reservation earlier as they are very popular in weekends.

The Calamari is really good. It's not your classic small rings. In stead it is a slab of high quality squid that is breaded and cooked. My wife doesn't like calamari, and she loved this. It was not chewy at all.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Absolutely loved the location and charm of this place - very cool patio and indoor area also. Did not love the food, unfortunately. Our dishes were very bland with flavor, although they were well-presented and filling.
Staff was completely lovely, but our server seemed a little disappointed that I ordered a soda instead of wine.
Bear in mind I’m a simple man of simple tastes, so upscale places aren’t my forte, but hopefully this review can help another in my situation.
Overall, I’d 100% recommend this place to a trendy, spendy friend looking for a new experience because it’s really neat. But I would not go back myself because I prefer taste and value to atmosphere.< /Review>

<Text>Loved their wine (heavy pours) and had a great appetizer and bread! But unfortunately when my friend went inside to go to the bathroom she overheard one of the managers talking about very controversial political opinions! While we had different political stances, I'm okay with it but try not to talk about it in front of paying customers. Especially when she was saying some offensive stuff :(</Text><UserId.>109454113286177130303</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

Great place to have lunch, the size of the plates is good, the quality of the food is great as well and they were very friendly. I give 4 stars because I would loved it if they had more vegetarian/vegan options. But I would totally recommend this place.</Review>

My husband and I have been here twice. Last time I had the smoked salmon sandwich- it was everything you would want out of a salmon sandwich. We also had the dolma appetizer, which was pretty up there with some of my favorite dolma. This time we had the goat cheese and honey with crostini and my husband had the chicken pesto sandwich and I had mussels as an entree (I scarfed them down before I remembered to take a pic. Whoops!) also the patio is the best seating in Carmel. It does fill up very quickly, because it’s a pretty small place!< /review>

<Review>Fab cute little restaurant minutes away from the beach at Caramel. Cozy outside sitting with heating lamps at twilight adds a lot of romance and warmth, no matter the occasion ( not to mention a dog friendly place). The menu is more than satisfying with a rich assortment of Italian, Thai and Mediterranean options. I am going again (worth the 2 hours drive from Mountain View).</Review>< Pics>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>After having read such great reviews online about the Treehouse Café we decided to try it for dinner. Unfortunately, we left very unsatisfied.
We ordered the bolognese pasta and the sauce tasted undone and like the sofrito base didn’t cook down enough. The special was a creamy tomato seafood pasta and it lacked flavor. We’re not too big on adding a ton of salt to food but the sauce needed it. We also ordered the cheese burger medium rare and it was brought to the table well done.
I will say that the wine pour was generous and good and the ambience was quaint and cute. However, the food did not meet our expectations. We’ve had our share of pastas in Italy and nonna’s cooking but this did not taste authentic. In fact, it stung when we received the bill and saw how much we were charged.
Being that Carmel attracts many tourists year round I hope that the Treehouse Café makes some improvements to the food.</Text>< pictures>

<response>None</response><text>Great spot. Hospitality is wonderful.  Menu is eclectic a little of everything. Delicious California and Mediterranean cuisine. Plates look great. Tastes are well thought out. Food well prepared. Good low priced wine menu with big pours. We have eaten there many times and for me it is my go to. Eat outside 1 floor above the street or more intimately inside. I highly recommend Tree House.< /text>< rate>

Bruchetta and Veggie pasta were OK..Chicken Pesto Sandwich was great..Pasta was too expensive though..I can have better pasta at many other places for less than $18<//Text>

We really enjoyed our lunch at Treehouse Café. It was a cozy atmosphere, offered outdoor seating, touted great service and delicious food. We will definitely be back, hopefully for dinner next time!<//text>

<review>The food at Treehouse Cafe was very delicious. I ordered the Gyros for lunch and it was excellent, the beef was moist and not dry. It was too bad I didn't have room for the Greek burgers my companions ordered as well because they looked very very good and I wanted some too. The wait staff were very friendly and polite and very accommodating for our water requests on a hot day. I loved the decor and ambiance in the restaurant too. There was a queue for the single bathroom but that was no biggie the food and service were great!< /review></record></dataset><record>

The food is amazing here. The host, waiters, bussers and cooks all worked amazing together last night as a team. The restaurant was so busy and the wait was long. I highly recommend making reservations in advance... Just don't be too upset when your reservation becomes delayed because a large group doesn't want to finish their wine. I got to give it to this restaurant last night. I made reservations for 8 pm last night.. we probably were seated around 8:30pm maybe later it was definitely crowded. The staff all were wearing masks perfectly like you would hope. Tables are spaced apart. Only con is they only have one restroom... But what can you do.

I had the calamari for an appetizer and yellow curry for dinner. My spouse has the Greek burger with salad. Both were mouth watering. I don't normally like calamari but it was a steak and cooked to perfection.
This place has a wonderful romantic atmosphere and is dog and family friendly. If you are willing to wait for a seat on the deck I think it is worth it.
Thank you staff for our best night in Carmel. A great way to end a small vacation post covid.</text>

<Review>Had a great quiet meal in a quaint restaurant. We had lamb kebabs with saffron rice and a prawn pasta dish in a garlic cream sauce. Scrumptious bread. Eclectic menu . Great service. No wait and meal came within like 15 minutes.< /Review>< Pictures>

It’s our go-to place to eat when we are in the area. We usually have our dogs & kids, and we love how welcoming they are every time!! The food is fantastic and the price is reasonable. Pleasant Ambience indoor & on the deck. Always super friendly and customer-service oriented.< /Review>

The ambience and setting is amazing. I called for the fish ($27) which was undercooked and tasted off. I called for extra sauce twice, it never came. The bread served with the roasted garlic does not pair well at all. The staff is friendly but no one came to check how the meal was. Other stuff we ordered was decent.</Review>

<Review>Treehouse was across the street from hotel so we decided to try it out. Food and service were great! Menu is eclectic with leaning to Mediterranean. Wife had lamb kabobs, I had Paella. Lamb was extremely tender and was delicious! Pasole was fantastic! Clams and mussels were tender, chicken melt in your mouth and just enough sausage to give it some spice and flavor. We both had wine which was a large pour for the price. Will definitely go back!< /Review>< Date>

If you take anything away from this review please remember that the food was awesome and we will be back! We enjoyed our gyro salad, platter, and lamb kabobs tremendously! The reason my review slipped from 4 to 3 stars were some logistical issues we had with our experience. First the bathroom situation is a bit limited with only one toilet for the entire restaurant and it was a bit messy and without paper towels. Second there seemed to be a lack of silver ware as we were provided set ups in waves, so first forks, then knives and napkins. Can’t wait to check back with Tree House once these two things are resolved!<//review>

<Text>Excellent food;  very nice and friendly staff; and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  We had the gyro platter, the chicken kabob platter, the hummus and the bruschetta. I honestly can't say which dish was best, because they were all so good! The restaurant itself is fun and the music they play is so welcome. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin. ..oldies galore! Definitely go if you visit Carmel.< /Text>< response>

Superb food! Good wine, and great service. I highly recommend the beef stroganoff, it was absolutely delicious.

The Baklava was a great addition for dessert. I will definitely visit this restaurant again, when I'm back in Carmel.< /Review>

Incredible little place. Ambiance is amazing and so is the food. The seafood pasta is always an excellent choice. The staff and service are really the best as well, specially Stoyan, Shaheem, and Nadeem. These guys really rock!</Text>

Clam chowder is great! Generally an eclectic mix of Italian, Thai and American food. A bit on the pricey side but food was good. Clam chowder was worth it.<//Review>

Great Mediterranean food with outstanding service! We sat outside on the 2nd story patio & loved the atmosphere! The gyros are really good & my husband said the pork sausage appetizer is the best sausage he's ever had! We went to lunch at 11:15 & had no problem getting a table. They are kid friendly (and dog friendly too!). We'd go back!</review>

We were looking for a nice, quiet place to have a date night. This place was perfect for my husband and I to get some quality time without the kids. We went on a Friday evening in early April and almost had the place to ourselves. Ambiance was romantic and relaxing and the wine and food we're wonderful. We will definitely be back. Service was top notch too.</review>

Stumbled across this place while strolling through Carmel. I was a little hesitant given the diverse menu, but what a great find. Staff were not just friendly but entertaining. I had the Green Curry with Chicken and would dare say most Thai restaurants could not achieve it’s fine taste. My wife had the Chicken Kabobs and was cooked to perfection and had a freshness to the meat and salad. Wonderful setting out on the patio overlooking the street with heat lamps adding to quite a cozy atmosphere.</Review>

During a recent trip to Carmel, I ate here with family.  Food was exceptionally delicious!  A memorable meal, and beautiful setting.  Loved the outdoor dining area.

I've been to many very good restaurants over the years, but never given a 5 star rating.  This is the first!  😮☺</Text>

We stopped at this beautiful town and found this restaurant. The rooftop plays Mediterranean music with a cozy environment. We ordered the Greek Burgers that come with a salad. Both were great! The burger was on point and super tasty. The grilled onions was amazing. The stuff was super friendly as well. Highly recommend.<//text>

My Sister & family visited...we had a beautiful sunny patio lunch for 4.
Calamari appetizer
The Greek burger w carmelized onion..the best w Greek side salad.
Topped off w a Lime pie & Chocolate cake for the table ..delicious.
My niece was impressed that the waiter didn't write anything down.
We all laughed & talked how professional customer service they have in Carmel by the Sea.  Very top notched food experience.
Tremendous wine selection...
Owner & manager checked in w us ..made us feel very special.</review>

<review>Lovely outdoor venue, perfect for enjoying the breeze, CA sunshine, great food, and a glass of vino with a friend. Honestly, I really did feel as if I was dining in a tree house! The manager who greeted us was joyful, classy, and accommodating. The service and food was excellent. If you are on vacation, as we were, and want to experience the flavor of this quaint, charming, seaside town,  this restaurant is a must!<//review>< pictures>

I rarely say a restaurant is perfect but I’m sayin it now! First of all we were super late for our Sat night reservation and they just giggled and seated us immediately- even giving us a choice of tables. The waiters are so friendly and warm and appropriately attentive and so flippin’ handsome (not that that matters). Oh yes, the food...we are vegetarians so had the Caesar salad- delish, lentil soup- the perfect blend of flavors and the veggie pasta with an incredible sauce to slide the soft yet crunchy cooked to perfection bread in. To seal the deal we had key lime pie for dessert and I know my KLPs and it was excellent. I wish I lived here so I could eat her all the time. Thanks for a delightful dining experience and comfy ambience.< /text>

A great little eatery in Carmel, the rooftop seating area is really good, they do not take reservations but if the wait is not too long its is worth it. the food was good. had the beef stroganoff with pasta which was decent but could have maybe had a little more meat, my partner had the Gyros which was excellent. the entire experience was quaint and I would return.< /Text>

We sat at the outside patio. It was nice weather, but noticed they do have heaters when needed. We had the Salmon dish, Sea Bass, Beef Stroganoff, Yellow Curry and the Ribeye special. All were delicious. Fyi, the curry was considered more spicy (than mild as stated by menu) by someone who loves spicy hot foods, so it was fine. This place is a local favorite of 2 people in our group. Was the first time for the others, but all agreed we would come back.< /text>

Food here was good, and service was excellent. We came in for a quick bite before we left on a long drive back home. We sat outside, which was very pleasant. They didn't have a kids menu, but made a small plate for my baby from one of the menu items. Nice experience overall.<//Review>

Certainly will havr to come back and try other great looking delicacies.

Favorite restaurant in Carmel these days. Especially when dining with our dog Winston, who the staff remembers from year to year.  Great food, personalized service.  They make a great olive oil-parmesan cheese dip for bread.  Probably the best outdoor seating in Carmel.<//review>

I was expecting at least a solid 3 in dining experience, based on the overall 4.6 rating (restaurant ratings in and around Monterey seem to be artificially inflated, for some reason).

The servers were friendly, but did forget to put our appetizer order in. We got the chicken pesto pasta and the beef stroganoff. Both dishes were severely lacking in meat portions, so we ended up paying about $22 - $24 for a bowl of noodles. The meals were relatively bland and tasteless. I think this restaurant uses its location, rather than food quality, to attract customers.

The chicken pesto pasta was greasy and oily for some reason. The chicken was not great.

The beef stroganoff was the saddest thing we received. There were 5 tiny pieces of beef in a huge bowl of noodles. They advertised mushrooms in this recipe, but we found no mushrooms in the bowl. They advertise this as Russian beef stroganoff. What they neglect to mention is this is the wartime rationed meat version of Russian beef stroganoff.

Overall, we were extremely disappointed and will not be back. I don't know what's up with the 5 star reviews, but we certainly did not have a great experience. I believe just about any restaurant in the Barnyard shopping center is superior, so I recommend you go there instead.< /Review>

Pretty place for sure, but without being treated right, it's hard to appreciate it.

We were seated by an uncomfortable corner of the patio right next to where the waiters constantly walk past. That was okay, since we could've chosen to change. Once our waiter appeared, he asks us 3 questions stereotyping us, mechanically and unthinkingly. After his "revealing questions", it is soon exposed within seconds of being seated that we are vegetarians. Again, too soon and too mechanically, he gives us 3 quick options that are the only ones available to us and to let him know. Waiter quickly exits the scene.

We wonder for a few minutes on what that was and decide that this is not the experience we want to give our money for. And thus we make our exit too.< /Text>

< Review>
Average for the area but the area is very very good.

Atmosphere- 4 stars. Even though the rooftop deck in on the street, traffic sounds were low and trees in the area aw well as the building itself create a relaxing atmosphere. Dog friendly even though you have to walk through he restaurant to get to the deck.

Food. 3.5 stars.   The food was good.  We had Chicken Pesto Pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the chicken was tender.  The pesto cream sauce was rich but not oily.    They let us split the plate which was about perfect for lunch.

Service: 0 stars.  Servers were attentive and kind but I had an issue with my glass of wine.  I had an expensive glass of nice wine which I was nursing through dinner and had only had a couple of sips.

Near the end of dinner, a gust of wind flipped the table cloth up spilling my mostly full glass of wine.  I got a servers attention and told him what had happened and asked for some new napkins since ours were drenched in wine.  They  mopped up the wine with  the napkins but left a damp table and    didn't come back with new napkins.  They also didn't offer to comp or top off my glass.  That was a major fail.</Review>

Great menu and lovely outdoor seating on a second level patio surrounded by trees. The lamb shank curry was perfection! A family member had suggested a visit to Carmel when we were visiting the Monteray Bay Aquarium, and everything closer to the aquarium seemed more touristy and overpriced for the quality. I am SO glad we found this little gem a short drive south. I might visit the area again solely for another meal at the Treehouse Cafe!<//review>

awesome little place in this beautiful town of carmel. It's close to the beach as well.
Food was not bad and the service was impeccable. Gives you a feel of being in Italy.< /text>

This is our favorite place in Carmel and we always come visit. It has Italian, Thai, and Greek options (I know right?) And it does all of them amazingly! You can't go wrong with any dish here. The wine glasses also have generous pours hehe<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Totally exceeded all of my expectations. The owner is very friendly and personable and they have the best wait staff I've ever seen in a restaurant. We got there on Saturday night without a reservation and a party of 6. We were told 10 minute wait but when it took a little longer they opened up the private wine room in the back for us. Alberto was our waiter and he was fantastic. He went above and beyond. We will most definitely be coming back every time we're in town.<//review>< Response>

<Review>Beautiful candle and snifters, ornaments, and other beautiful things for yourself or to give as gifts. They are connected to Sock Shop with many differant socks for the whole family, many differant materials like wool, cotton, and synthetic mixes, many styles and fun socks.  They also have a few special slippers for all, one pair softer than a bunny and very comfortable, baby socks for Christmas, running socks and fancy support socks.< /Review>< Pictures>

Great food, hats off to chef.

We got a feeling that the waiter was rude, most probably because we ordered fewer foods than usual.

But the food is so awesome I didn't want to give them four.</review>

The food was mediocre. I ordered Thai Chicken Curry and send it back b/c it was overly sweet and overly spicy with a huge chunks of veggies. They did not charged us for that but later the charge showed up. The lamb chops were too thin to turn out medium rare and not so good. Mashed potatoes looked gray and starchy, Chicken Pesto Pasta was greasy in a pool of olive oil. Baklava was like from the store pastry dough. Service was excellent though and the ambience. Wish we never have gone there. :(< /Review>

Lovely little restaurant in Carmel. If you love a British kebab then the Pita sandwich is pretty close. Otherwise, everything is top notch, gyros, lasagne, stroganoff, pasta etc.< /Text>

I first visited Treehouse Cafe because they were dog friendly. I return time and again for the unbelievable service. The staff treats you as family, is always happy to see you, and will do everything to make sure you have a great meal and a great time. Oh, and the food's good, too. Whether it's ribeye, paella, dolmas, or chocolate cake, I've always been happy.<//Review>

Very confusing restaurant. My family came as a party to eat up by the balcony and it was chaotic. Smoked salmon was raw without a description in the menus,meat wasn’t cooked, and servers weren’t helping and taking way to long to help, and way to pricey for something that shouldn’t be. And their paying system is too confusing and over exaggerated. I do not refer this place to you.< /text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Location is very nice, good service, good food. Too expensive, like everything else in Carmel. We were there at noon, it was very busy, but the staff had everything under control. Highly recommended, even if it was not quite enough for me with five stars.

(Original)
Location ist sehr nett, guter Service, gutes Essen. Bisschen zu teuer, wie alles in Carmel. Wir waren mittags dort, es war sehr trubelig, das Personal hatte aber alles gut im Griff. Durchaus zu empfehlen, auch wenn es bei mir nicht ganz für fünf Sterne reichte.< /review>
