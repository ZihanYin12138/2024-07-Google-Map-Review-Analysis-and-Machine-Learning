< Review>
This was my first experience with renting a storage unit and I was very satisfied. Everyone was very professional and we’re so  helpful when I had questions. They even called me to tell me that I was past due on my monthly rent. I give a shout out to Ida who I spoke with several times... great customer service!!!</Review>

Rates kept going up every time I turned around. They removed my lock and replaced it with their own a few months after I got in there. They kept the new key in their office file cabinet so it never really felt secure. They expected me to come get the new key. I never agreed to any of that they just did it. In the end my stuff was safe and dry and the place is well maintained so its good enough.</text>

Friendly staff, clean facility, good security, and most importantly, they have lifts (cargo elevators) which allow you to take a ton of stuff up to the second floor with ease. Best storage facility I've belonged to...ever!< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I had already had a storage unit there as well as another storage place in town. The other storage unit was twice what I was paying at A1. I decided to clear out my more expensive unit and move it to A1. Patrick,  the store manager made renting an additional unit easy.  He was extremely helpful and very easy to deal with. He has a very happy attitude and I would highly recommend renting from A1 as a cost saver over Extra Space Storage.

Chris was awesome and thoroughly explained everything I needed to know and also gave me a tour of the entire place including the check in procedure and agreement and what is expected of us. I feel knowledgeable about using a "Lift" now and safety procedures at my unit. In addition the space and the price and the discounts were exactly what I was looking for and I didnt have a lot of time to go investigate it. It literally was the BEST DEAL on the internet for my location. Thanks again. I am very pleased! This experience exceeded my expectations. I got the First month free ($0!) AND THEY GAVE ME A FREE LOCK TO USE WITH MY UNIT! YOU GOTTA LOVE FREE $$$!!< /text>

This place was wonderful to store our items. We were in the second floor and we were happy with the location of the storage. There is an elevator for the heavier items so you don't have to lug them up. The guys that work there were also very nice and always available when we had a question. I love that they have longer hours here. I think it was from 7-8pm. We just entered the code and we were in an out. They installed cameras which we loved since that made the location safer.
The only negative thing is that our rent went up every 6 months. We started with paying like $80 and we ended up with $111 a month for a 5x10 storage unit. I wish we could have kept our storage but we were told that it was going to be going up again in a few months so we decided to part ways.<//review>

<text>It’s all good except for the fact that they raise their prices too much per year. In 2013 I started at $200 a month and I’m up to $310 a month and it’s 2019. VIP storage a quarter-mile north of here has better prices although they do have narrower hours.< /text>< username>

<rate>5</rate><Review>This is my first time having to use a storage unit and I was a little nervous about it at first. I spent some time researching where to go and I knew I wanted a location close to where I’m living. I called a couple of places and the associates at A-1 promptly returned my call the first time I called and then I called again with another question and they answered right away. I appreciated being able to talk to a person and not a machine. They were also very helpful in setting up my paperwork for the unit and then they gave me a tour and a demonstration on how to use the lock. I got an upstairs unit to save money and I can’t believe how easy it is! I just load up my things onto a cart and wheel it into a freight elevator. When I couldn’t get my key to work one of the times I called the desk for help and Gary came to help me. So far I’ve had a great experience and I would highly recommend it!<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I set an appointment for another day but was in the area and stopped to see if they would mind showing me a unit. Both ladies were very friendly, helpful and gave me total attention. Showed me the unit and were very informative. Shawn explained every thing about their policies, offered me what ever services I might need. I was so impressed with these gals and decided to rent the unit right then rather than do any more looking around. It is not often you feel welcomed and at ease right at the start like that. Grace and Shawn are wonderful. While there I witnessed interaction with another tenant and loved that they get to know your name. Also impressed  with their security and the cleanliness of the buildings and grounds. I am very happy with this decision .</Text><resp>{'time': 1418234586601, 'text': 'Grace & Shawn are a great team!

<Text>I have been benefiting from this A-1 Storage for a long time. I've used a couple of competitors in the past but have been genuinely happier with A-1.

For one thing, the facility is kept very clean. They obviously put ample effort into maintaining the property.

The security is impressive as well. A person needs more than simple access to the property to break into anyone else's unit. The layers of security are comforting.

The staff has always been helpful. When there was an issue in my section of the property I was called promptly and informed of the problem. I was headed over to verify the situation was not originating in my unit but they called me back as they found the correct unit and resolved things with that customer. They handled everything quickly and professionally while still being friendly and forthcoming with the important details.

The recent update of their website has been a helpful improvement and I've not encountered a single glitch.

I encourage you to check out this storage solution.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Grace and Shawn give me hope that great customer service is not dead.  I wish I could give them more business because they are a pure pleasure to do business with.  They are helpful, attentive and respond quickly to resolve issues.  In a world of voice mail menu mazes these ladies are a breath of fresh air.  You can have complete confidence with these gals who have been operating this facility for many years.  You won't be dealing with a novice at this location which unfortunately I find in too many operations.  Yes, I'm a demanding consumer so my positive reviews don't come easily.  I have had two separate contracts here and ZERO PROBLEMS.  These ladies deserve the highest praise!!!

On a side note, I had a contract with Public Storage in the Bronx and it was a total nightmare.  My stuff was ruined....   See my complete review on Yelp.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I used A1 Storage for over a year and was very pleased with the kindness of the office team, as well as the cleanliness of the storage facility. Having the flatbed carts available is also a great benefit. When deciding to move out, I made sure to give one week notification, so I only paid for the few days past my start date not the whole month.
Great service. Thank you.< /Review>< pictures>

There is nothing wrong with the storage unit, everything was super easy to get in and out of. The only complaint I have is there is no AC (and it gets very hot in there) and there is no light or even an outlet for a light. Other than that, it seems to be safe and well managed.<//review>

In March 2014, my husband and myself came in to check out the storages there. Shawn helped us, she was very friendly, helpful and very informative. She took us where our unit will be. We both felt very comfortable with her. She is also very creative and had the office decorated both times we were there, which made you feel happy when you walk in. We came back in April and she was at the front desk. Because of her we decided to store our things at this location. You have a very reliable, efficient employee, she is a keeper! We will look forward in doing business with her in the future. My husband and myself rate her and your clean facilities a 5.<//review>

My husband and myself rate her and your clean facilities a 5.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80d958386065107f:0x891bc4836f225ed1< /gmap_id></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>For all New customers of A1 Self-Storage. I moved into the Magnolia location on 01-16-2014.  But before I chose A1 I shopped around for the best deal I found 2 places that were a few dollars cheaper but this location was perfect for my needs, Grace and Shawn were there on my first day they had some questions about the contents, you know checking for flammable type stuff I told I was a collector of comic books and I was very  concerned about water leaks and bugs and theft Shawn was very informative about the location and how well the property was kept up and the alarm system,  basically she alleviated all my fears we did an extensive walk through of different units that might suit my needs they were both very patient and understanding, I not exactly happy with the 2 or 3 rate increases i have had in the short time I have been there but to tell the truth Shawn and Grace are not all stuffy and straight lace business type I found at other storage places they made me feel at home and comfortable to leave my thousands of dollars worth for comics the.  Because of my rate increases I want to leave but every month I go pay my bill either one of the 2 ladies give a reason to stay and do there best to justify the increases.  The day Shawn and Grace leave this location so do I,</Text>< Pictures>

My family has used A-1 Self Storage for years in the El Cajon location. This April, due to a family trauma, we had to utilize there services again to expedite my parents possessions into a safe and reliable location. We were able to get one that was almost directly across from their original storage unit. Grace, the employee who just happens to be on duty every time we need something, is exceptional. During our time of greatest need and greatest stress, she was awesome. Her customer service skills are one in a million.

A few months later, I needed to find a better Memory Care for my Dad. Since he has Alzheimer's and no one else remembered the code, Grace was quite helpful in letting me know what I needed to do to get the storage in my name and gain entry. The new place for my Dad is a bit more money and I needed to combine the units because my siblings are paying the extra money, as well as the storage. I needed to take some of it off their plate. The bottom line is that while I'm doing all this stressful stuff, the help of a gracious employee is a wonderful thing. Nowadays it is also a not-so-frequent thing.<//review>

Grace and Shawn were not only incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, but they were also extremely personable and professional.  They answered all of my questions and  understood just how important the items that I am storing are to me and my family.  They provided me with the necessary piece of mind that I needed in order to store my items at A-1 Self Storage.  Both Grace and Shawn went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable in selecting A-1 Self Storage to store my items.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs to store anything.< /Text>

<Review>Shawn and Grace are great! From the second I walked in I was greeted and helped. Shawn took me around and showed me the available units in her golf cart. She was very pleasant and answered all my questions. I would definitely rent with them again!

Also I was given a discount on the rent because i'm a military service member.

Keep up the good work Shawn and Grace!</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80d958386065107f:0x891bc4836f225ed1< /GmapID></record>

A storage space is a storage space.  A certain amount of rented space to store your "stuff" in.  What makes a storage facility great is the people behind the counter.
Both Grace and Shawn, from day one, have made my renting experience both easy and pleasurable.  Grace and Shawn are extremely pleasant to talk to and both are extremely knowledgeable about A1's standards and practices.  They both go out of there way to help new and existing customers.  I would not be at this facility if these two where not there.</Review>

<review>We stored our belongings here at A-1 Storage on Magnolia for 26 months!!  Didn't think we'd need it that long, but the office staff was so considerate, professional and helpful.  It was nice to know that our "whole house" (which fit into a 10x30) ...was safe and sound!!   What was supposed to be a short storage ended up being much longer - life happens:  ...between selling and buying, we became caregivers for our parents who were 93 yrs old, living with them and caring for them daily.  I'd highly recommend the El Cajon A-1 Self Storage on Magnolia Ave to anyone around who needs to keep their stuff "safe and sound."<//review>< Pics>

The awesome first impression was contributed to Grace.  As soon as I walked through the door she got up out of her chair and came around the desk to greet me.  The friendly gesture revealed so much about the company and its associates.  Grace and Shawn are a delight to talk with and are very knowledgeable about their facility.  They asked me questions related to my reasons for wanting storage and helped me find the right unit for my needs; they told me that most people can often rent smaller units if they utilize the space efficiently.  Even though there are “newer” facilities around, the facility is maintained in Like-new condition and is very clean.  All in all, I had a very nice experience at A-1 Self Storage and would recommend them to anyone.  Needless to say, I am now a very happy and satisfied customer. Thank you Grace and Shawn for all your help!<//Review>

<Review>Nobody does it better than Shawn & Grace. They are always polite, professional & helpful. You can always see one of them out taking care of the grounds. I know how important the items that I store are and having a well kept facility makes me feel good. One thing that does impress me is how important they use there PPE (personal protection equipment) dust masks & safety being at the top of the list. Grace & Shawn treat me like I m one of family. The A-1 family. I always know that when I go into the office not only will I get first class service but a friend as well.  I  LOVE THE DECORATIONS!

I have been through a number of storage places in the past few years. I can honestly say this is a very nice facility, clean and well maintained. The desk person, I think her name was Shawn, gave me a wealth of information and some good comparisons. I haven't decided if I need the unit, but if I do, this is where I'm coming.<//text>

It'd rare when a the lowest price option is also the best option when it comes to customer service and value. But that will be exactly what you'll receive when you rent space from A-1/Magnolia in El Cajon.

Don't believe me? Visit them tomorrow and see for your self. It's clean, secure and the office team is great. Ask for Grace. You won't be disappointed!</text>

<text>Hello Folks,
Just like to say if I had a company and people like Grace were my asset I would crush any competitor like a cockroach. Grace is an exceptional employee at A1 Storage  and I do hope her manager recognize the importance of a front line person with genuine care for her customers. She essentially runs the location like it was her business, outstanding work ethics, courteous, helpful and kind, not to mentioned he smile and zest for life  . Again if I had a business and was looking for staff Greace will be on my team. Do business with Grace and you will be very happy at A1- Storage. No BS here folks. I don't usually do testimonials.  Management can train all they want but these qualities are in Grace's veins.< /text></record>

We've used this facility in the past.  Grace helped us a couple of years ago..  She is a delightful person and an asset to A-1.
We came back and were greeted by Grace and Shawn.  Both are very friendly and helpful.
They got us set up in a hurry and we were on our way. Nice, streamlined operation.
I'd recomnend this facility.
Shawn and Grace make this a pleasant experience.
Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>I got a unit with Grace today. I was feeling pretty down about my living situation and having to put my belongings in storage but Grace made all the difference and cheered me up with her positive attitude and passion about what she does. This was my first storage renting experience and I am very thankful I got 5 star service from A-1< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>I had a great experience with this A-1 Self Storage location. Shawn and Grace are very helpful and always friendly to the customers. I would recommend this storage location to any of my friends and family and if I need storage in the future I would gladly come back here to work with them again.<//review><user_id>114038825740940475448<//user_id>< Pics>

My experience was fantastic.  I arrived less than an hour before closing and Grace and Shawn were incredibly quick and thorough.  I knew very little about the extensive details and they explained it very well.  Not only that, but they were very friendly as well.  I would go to this location again soley because of those 2.  Thanks Grace and Shawn!</Review>

It'd rare when a the lowest price option is also the best option when it comes to customer service and value. But that will be exactly what you'll receive when you rent space from A-1/Magnolia in El Cajon.

Don't believe me? Visit them tomorrow and see for your self. It's clean, secure and the office team is great. Ask for Grace. You won't be disappointed!<//Review>

Those two ladies have the most positive attitudes and the customer service was OUTSTANDING. Explained everything in great detailed and presented a passionate vibe about their jobs. It's very rare to come across an establishment that values the customer these days. I will HIGHLY RECOMMEND this establishment to anyone.<//text>

Grace and Shawn are, simply put, the most professional moving folks i have dealt with during my entire move process!  They helped me think about what i needed before i could wrap my mind around it, and they were very patient and helpful in the signup process.  They were a delight to work with and i wish all my "move vendors " were as thoughtful and nice and explained everything the way they did!  They really made me feel as if my business was wanted and that is VERY RARE to find these days.  thank you so much Grace and Shawn.  the facility is very very clean and i feel safe there whenever i go there.  it has convenient access to everything you might need (home depot, mall/shopping, etc).  Mwaaa!<//review>

<review>After a long day of packing and moving we finally made it down and pulled up on a Sunday 30minutes before closing in hopes to sign up for a unit. I know how it feels when people show up right before closing .. But we had such a friendly experience. Shawn made it awesome and even stayed to help do paperwork for us so we could get a unit before they closed. Couldn't ask for better customer service ! Thanks!!<//review>< pictures>

I am completely satisfied with my experience with A1 Self Storage. I made the mistake of reserving a storage space that was entirely too small for all my stuff. Grace saved me time and money and quickly upgraded me into a larger space. She got me into a space that was close to the first space and turned a potentially long bad day into a great customer service experience.< /text>

<review>Shawn and Grace are very personable and provide outstanding customer service. I recently relocated from out of state and have had my personal belongings stored at the A-1 Self Storage for the past 4 years. They have been remarkable over the years and it's nice to come back to my personal belongings after so many years. I appreciate their dilligence and tactful way in which they resolve any issue. Thank you Shawn and Grace for your prefessionalism!</review>< Response>

Super friendly staff, highly maintained property, excellent security and reasonable prices. After looking at a few other facilities this place was a no Brainer when deciding where to stor my mothers belongings. Would definitely recommend this facility.< /review>

I *would* have rated this storage place as *excellent* had the following not occurred:

After paying for the insurance provided by A-1 for many months, i gave them my paperwork for my own personal renters insurance. My monthly storage rental rate was supposed to be decreased by $10.... (which i was paying twice that amount for my renters insurance)....

Well *2 days!!!* after they accepted my renters insurance policy, i get a letter stating that "due to normal operating costs' or something similar, that they are "forced" to increase the rental fees when necessary (and the letter states this can happen twice a year)....

I have had rental units for over 10 years, and i know that sometimes rates do fluctuate... however, i hadn't even had my unit 1 year, and my bill was increasing...

I just think it was a little too "coincidental" that the "necessary increase" just happened to be the same $10 amt. that i was supposed to be saving from my renters insurance....  If my storage unit rental rate is going to be increasing 2 times a year, then i will most definitely be shopping for a new location pronto.<//review>

<review>I have used your location in EC & helped by Grace Benniefield twice now.  It was the best customer service experience I have had in my 10 years in San Diego. After using the EC location, I chose your EC store over the closer one in Lakeside.

I am an employee of Cigna Healthcare and know what good Customer Service should be.  Grace is trainer material and should be utilized to have your entire team follow her lead.  I was so impressed with her smile, attitude, commitment and all that goes into helping the customer.  She is very valuable to your company!

Thank you Grace!

Shawn and Grace have always been helpful, cheerful,and professional. I recently placed a new lock on my storage latch. They called and texted me to notify me of the discrepancy with their records and files. I assured them that i had replaced the previous lock, the old one broke, with the new one. I appreciate that level of follow through and security... Sincerely, Marc Loomis</Text>

<review>GET YOUR STORAGE ROOM HERE !!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I want to start off with saying that all the 5 star reviews are on point. I have had a unit here for years, and I definitly would say it is because of Grace and Shawn. Not only are they professional, they are very personable. They keep the whole facility very clean. They are always courteous and patient every time I see them. I especially love that Grace always makes sure to have sweet treats and Shawn always keeps the office bright and beautifully decorated. I definitly reccommend anybody that needs a storage room to get one here! You will love it !!!!!!!!!!!!</review>< rating>

<Text>I have been a customer at A-1 Storage for several years. I am writing to express my obervations relating to the staff at this location, specifically Grace and Shawn.
It is a real pleasure to work with both of these ladies. Each goes out of their way to call me when equipment is shipped to my unit.
The atmosphere inside the front office is always friendly and professional. The front office is seasonally decorated and each time I stop in I am greated with a smile and a "can do" attitude.
I just want the A-1 Storage adminstrative staff to know how hard working and professional Grace and Shawn are.

I have rented from A-1 Storage for quite some time and I have always been impressed with their customer service and their facilities (very clean and nicely accessible)
Recently the storage I aquired at the El Cajon, Magnolia St location, I was assisted by Shawn and I must say she was very friendly, very helpful and informative. She made the  experience very pleasant....Thank you Shawn!!< /review>

< Review>
The below was my original and this is my final review. I like the staff and the facility was clean. Just a pain going up and down the stairs but that is what was available. Also, the price went up within a short time after I got there. I think its a little trick they do to get people to use there units who knows tho

Shawn and grace were amazing! They made feel like family and thanked me numerous times for chooseing there storage location. We have been looking for awhile and everwhere else the personnel were not friendly and the places were way of of my budget. Shaen and grace were absolutely great and helped me with everything i needed done and asked all my questions. I havent met a more professional and polite company. We choose the best place. Thank you for everything ladies.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>1. FRIENDLY, PROFESSIONAL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE!!!

After having a horrible experience elsewhere, I came to the A-1 on Magnolia in El, Cajon  hoping to have a different experience.

Friendly

1. As soon as I walked into the door, I was immediately greeted with a warm smile by GRACE who tended to all of my inquiries fast and thoroughly.

Professional

2. Grace then took us outside to give us a tour of the location which was really nice because we were able to see how the location was secured and where the different storage rooms where located.
Knowledgable

3. During the tour, we were informed of how to properly open/close the gates in the front entrance and exit. In addition we were shown how to move our stuff in and out of the elevator. (We had a room in the 2nd floor).

4. After the tour, she went over the necessary paperwork. Grace was AMAZING in explaining the purpose of some of those documents.

5. If i could give this place 10 stars I would. GRACE is wonderful and made our moving experience less of a hassle!

Miscellaneous: The office was creatively decorated with 4th of July decorations! Created such a welcoming atmosphere. Coming from a military household I really appreciated the sense of patriotism!!! [Not to mention the military discount ; ) ]< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I went here after Jummah (around Asr time) so I was able to find a parking space, but I imagine it would be really difficult to find a parking space for Jummah. I liked the small intimate setting and I met a nice sister there that I had a good conversation with. The thing I appreciated the most, by far, is that the women pray BESIDE the men, not behind them in an inferior position per typical one room masajid.<//text>< time>

I attended the Friday Khutba in this beautiful new Lighthouse mosque. The Imam has a beautiful Quran recitation and addresses the community in a passionate and genuine way. This mosque has a great spirit of service to the community.< /Review>

<Text>Lighthouse Mosque is one of the nicest mosque in the bay area in a peaceful neighborhood. It's a very clean and serene place to be. Great place for worship and community activities. The Imams of the mosque are very knowledgeable and down to earth and they rotate at this masjid. The jomo3a Khutbas are always great and informative. I highly recommend lighthouse Mosque to anyone from the area.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

In light of recent events that transpired in one local mosque during jumah prayer I decided that enough was enough and enough was too much. I decided to give the Lighthouse Mosque a shot., Admittedly the place was a lot smaller than I had imagined but the spirit of Islam madup for it. It has truly been a long time since I was at a masjid were the muslims seemed to count Islam as a favor conferred on them, ratherthan vice versa.

I wish them well in their efforts to acquire a new building to occupy, inshallah.

I really enjoy getting my hair cut here, it’s a one man barber shop meaning there’s only one barber and that’s it.  Sometimes theres a small wait , I’m patient and don’t mind because he’s well worth it , speedy yet super fresh and clean every time I get a cut by him i leave his shop feeling like a million,  ohh yea I forgot one thing he’s super affordable< /Text>

I’ve been going to this barber shop  for about two years and I’ve always had a great experience. While haircuts here  and I’m happy to support such a good local business. Very friendly atmosphere and they give you a free drink when you walk in!< /review>

Great barber, takes his time and makes sure the job is done right!  For being the best barber in San Diego (my opinion), his prices are crazy low.  Will never go anywhere else!</review>

Have been coming to Salaar for years. There is a slight wait, but it is perfectly ok because he takes his time with your haircut. He takes pride in his craft and you can tell by the finished product. He is very friendly and I highly recommend him.<//text>

Salaar does a great job! He cuts your hair exactly as you want him to. I've seen him shave other customers & takes his time to give quality cuts to his customers. My son & I have been coming for almost a year and he has not disappointed once.<//Review>

Awful. Came in on Sunday waited about an hour and a half, kept telling me I'm next but always took a new customer. I even called in and asked if I should make an appointment, he said no it was walk in friendly but after I got tired of waiting I left to go to another barber shop.< /Text>

This is a great place to get a haircut.  I'm pretty precise with my hair and how I want it cut, but it never fails I get the perfect fade every time never miss any spots or uneven. I don't even have to check to make sure it's good, because I know it is. Well worth spending time on the details. Come back every week!</Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I've been getting my haircut here for three years now, and Salar is unbeatable. He is meticulous and makes sure each customer gets everything they want. He also does threading and straight razor work. And another thing - he stays open way later than the store hours listed. If he's got a customer waiting, he cuts their hair. It's almost 9:30 now and although he was supposed to quit at 8 he's still going. Great barber with great style. Clear your schedule and give him a try.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Firstly, i would like to say thank you to Salar for cutting my hair & providing a great friendly and chill atmosphere in your shop. Secondly, to whom is in need of a good barber on a routine basis then come on by and support local barbershop DOUBLE IMAGE.
Definitely recommend to any one in the area.</text>< pictures>

Salaar does a great job with traditional cuts for my dad and also more modern cuts for myself. The prices are also good compared to around El Cajon and all around San Diego. I make the trip from Chula Vista to his shop in El Cajon.< /Review>

<text>Salar,  is a very good barber with really great haircut prices. I get  lined up and a straight razor finish always does a great job.  i will always go to him,  he cuts all types of hair. He does first come first serve and doesn't "pick" his favorite customers over anyone. Ive never had any problems with waiting.<//text><gmapID>0x80d959b50c765457:0x60bf994a65081405</gmapID>< user>

I got fed up and went looking for a new barber and stumbled on this place. There can be a slight wait because it's only one barber but for the quality of the haircut and the price you simply can't beat it. My best advice is to avoid high foot traffic hours, other than that on average it's one to two people ahead of you when you walk in.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The barber does not take appointments which leaves you hanging out for a long time for a cut. He increased his prices but doesn't do anything special. Lastly...the barber is not very personable.</Text>

Great barber great price. I always go here now that I found this place. He is great with a straight razor as well.
Always on point and will do what you want and is on top of the new trends of hair styles for men.< /review>

This was my first time ever going to a barber  and I must say I don't know why I had to get so many bad haircuts before I decided to try it out.
I got a haircut and a shave from "Salary" and he did a great job. I will definitely be back and I would refer any of my friends and family to give him a try.<//text>

No where else will you get as quality of a cut for the price he charges. Highly recommend going here!< /text>< user_id>

<text>This guy's knows what he's doing. Great haircuts for an even better price. Legit, always leaves me with a clean straight shave and leaves exactly how I want and I'm very pickey about my haircut let alone my barber. I've been going to Salar for over 3 years now and I live in Downtown but this barber is well worth the drive.< /text>< pics>

His prices are more than fair, and isnt expensive like other shops who charge $20+. Whether it be a haircut, or an eyebrow reshape, he always does a great job. Hes a very respectful man, amazing barber, and gives you a clean shave after every haircut. Definitely worth the 30 minute drive from Ramona< /review>< pics>

<Text>I love Salar. Very quality haircuts and i dont think the price can get much better than that. I always give him a $20 even though my hair cut cost half that amount, because of how fast, friendly, and how great he cuts my hair. He has a huge knowledge on technique and types of haircuts. Likes to hold conversation pretty well. Couches are also very comfortable and its in a quieter part of el cajon mostly.</Text><name>jay em< /name>< gmap_id>

Salar you the homie. Everytime I come here he is ready not only to give me a great cut, but also hook me up with great convo. I live in Oceanside and when I come to El cajon I make sure to get a cut from this barber shop. I recommend every one check it out</review>

Called beforehand to ask store hours/pricing
Person on phone confirmed open until 9PM, and that the price for a haircut is $10

Drove to location to find that me and another person went to get a haircut but all the blinds were closed and the lights were on inside but the doors were locked; knocking on door didn't appear to matter

Best car and boat audio installation company ever!!!!!!!! These guys have installed a full system in my boat and just installed an amazing JL audio sub system in my SUV. I've had many systems installed in many different cars with other companies and was never 100% happy. With this company I got people who really care about my audio system as much as I do.They do top notch installations. Very very clean and dialed in perfectly! I'll never go with anyone else but these guys!!! Be sure to ask for Chris!</review>

< review>
I regret going here. I had a good recommendation from a friend, but he isn't the most keen on seeing how people treat their cars. I expected more attention to detail and better work overall. I took my car and had all of my speakers replaced with full kicker KS. I pretty much had to research everything myself because when I would ask questions I didn't get much of an answer at all. I dropped my car off at 9am, I was one of the first people there and got my car back pretty much when they closed so I don't see the purpose in an appointment system when you're not going to handle the car at the appropriate time. I got the speakers back about 10 hours later. I later had a rattle in my door so I took it back  to get fixed and nothing had changed but then my door lock didn't work anymore so I basically had  to do the work myself and take my door panels off only to find BROKEN clips, loose screws, double sided tape holding broken pieces in place. I had BENDS in my door because they didn't know how to remove door panels and instead of watching a 5 minute video of how to pop these door panels off they just jammed screw drivers everywhere. Absolute joke of work. I could remove everything quickly without damaging anything (well whatever hadn't been damaged) and I was not going to make another appointment to wait a week just to get it checked out and leave with more problems. Working on high end cars unfortunately doesn't give you craftsmanship or respect to work on normal cars, it really shows how much respect you have for your work. I should go and complain about losing a bunch of clips that I can't even find online to replace, but oh well not going to waste my time any longer. FOR REFERENCE ON THE VEHICLE THEY WORKED ON IT WAS A 2015-2017 MUSTANG GT.< /review>

<review>I'm an average installer at best  but I know what I'm doing and I know what to look for. I have a 2015 Toyota Camry that I plan on putting my old system in. I didn't feel like fooling with the doors or rear deck so I took it to this place thinking "they should have their act together by now". My sister used to go there in the 90's and I might have went once back then. I had them install the Alpine R69C.2 component speakers in the front and the Alpine R69.2 coaxial speakers in the rear. In preparation for my system I decided to take a look at their work a little closely and notice that the rear speakers are NOT MOUNTED ON AN ADAPTER!!!!!!! I'll be correcting this myself. When I looked in the front I noticed that the crossovers for the tweeters were just dangling. Don't be fooled by the luxury cars out front. If you can't treat a regular customer like your high end customer why service regulars at all. I am beyond disappointed!!! By the way the two stars are for at least putting the speakers I asked for in there.....I've heard horror stories........As bad as I'd like to call or even go up there I'm going to use that energy and time TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY!!!!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I purchased a small stereo set up and a viper alarm immediately a week later my stereo would not work, the alarm was done so poorly I had to take my truck to Toyota the technicians inspected my wiring and found that pacific stereo cut into my wiring harness and Eventually Shorted out my system where my truck would not start,When I did contact Pacific stereo they said they did not have time to fit me in they were too busy, I would recommend to anyone to never go to Pacific stereo.</Review>

I needed a new radio, door lock actuator, back up camera, and speakers for my 2005 Tundra.  Andy and his team were all over it.  The system works great!!  I couldn’t be happier.  We did run across one issue with my rear DVD player after the install.  Andy ordered a replacement screen and it still did not work.  Andy ended up purchasing and installing a beautiful dvd system at no charge!  I was amazed and impressed!  He promised to make it right, whatever it took!  I’ll definitely recommend Andy and his team to all my family and friends!!<//text>

I had a problem with a Dash Kit that would not allow ON-STAR to work properly. When Chris Davis got involved, he told me Phillip I am going to resolve your problem and show you that we care here at Pacific Stereo about you. Chris did his research and contacted the manufacture of my dash kit and reasoned with them, and got me another dash kit. Every time I have came to Pacific Stereo, Chris Davis always has a smile, he is friendly, very knowledgeable about the equipment and has my car sounding like a live concert full of bass. If you want a good stereo system go to Pacific Stereo, if you want the very best customer service, see Chris Davis and see why he is their number one sales man<//Review>

So the initial install was reasonably priced and professionally done, however, my turn signals no longer click and my warning sounds no longer ding. . I called back. a week later about this and they said there's an adapter but every time I've tried to have the adapter installed, they're either too busy or don't have it or some other quack quack quack. . It was only a hundred bucks for the adapter and why the heck would make advised me that I was going to lose my safety notifications without it. When I initially came in? Now I have to take my time and give them my car for another hour. Whenever there Actually interested in doing it. .<//review>

I love my new i209-GM and also thanks to Chris for shipping out a replacement part on the same day that I spoke to him this past week. We could use a couple good car audio shops here in Oregon if you guys ever want to uproot and move. Thanks again!</Review>

Parking can be challenging with all the blind spots this car has, but now thanks to the camera I got installed at this location all is well!!! Jose is super knowledgeable, he made sure the camera was the perfect one for my car. They have a huge selection of audio equipment for all cars. In addition they have a great selection of wheels. I fell in love with a red set of wheels I saw here, so let’s just say I will be back. I’m super happy with the great service I received in addition to my purchase. I will recommend this place to family and friends. Very happy customer:).<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Andy.. my man
This guy is awesome, i took my Benz for a speaker upgrade and he hooked it up! He knew everything about my car without me saying much. He took care of my car as if it was his own. He has a lot of knowledge, and knows how to listen to the customer's needs and wants. He told me what the best was without having to overpay.
Customer service is 100%. I'm happy, satisfied, it's more than i expected. I hardly ever make any reviews, but this time.. i felt that i needed to make one. I already have a couple more projects in mind. I know where I'm going, and who to talk AGAIN!<//review>

After having horrible services and customer service from a now defunct business (JR Car Audio), I decided to give this business a try. Recommended my father to this stereo shop to install 2 Sundown Audio SD3-10's wired to a Sundown Audio SAE-1500D. They installed it amazingly and the box showed craftsman ship. It truly showed they know how to install Car Audio. They even notified us that the other Audio shop jipped us because they couldn't see any amp connected to the door speakers, even though JR Car Audio charged us for it.

Back to Pacific Stereo, I don't recall the name but the gentleman was extremely helpful.

Me personally, this interaction has made this spot my go to for Car Audio needs. As i am writing this, I will be taking my mustang in for a new upgrade (Upgrading the Door/Rear deck speakers).

4 Rockford Fosgate P1683 (6x8 3-way)
2 Skar Audio IX-8 (8" door woofers)

I currently have 2 Sundown Audio SA-12's on a Hifonics Brutus 2000.1D wired @ 1ohm, and they will be my guys to build the monster of a system for my car which will be

2 Sundown Audio Zv5 15" DVC 1ohm
1 Sundown Audio SFB-8000 (8000watts at 1ohm stable)
Upgraded electrical
Single slot port tuned to 30-32hz or 4th order if it fits.

Should hit 150dbs easily on music, i will update my review or post another as my system is built.

TL;DR: Highly Recommend, Been before and will continue to go in the future.</text>

<review>BEYOND HAPPY!!!  ANDY FROM PACIFIC STEREO, YOU ARE THE MAN!!! I have a Mercedes 2007 SL 550,  I wanted a after market stereo with Navigation and Bluetooth.  Simple I thought, not with Best Buy! I went to Best Buy and got my system installed, it was so bad that i took it back and had them take it all out!  They had no idea what they were doing, I lost a few of my speaker sounds, all of my base was gone! When i talked to manager, he referred me to the Stereo Tech guy from Best Buy who trains all the techs.  He told me that I could never have a good quality system with a after market stereo in my Mercedes, that Mercedes made it difficult for that reason.  WHAT? THAT CRAZY! WE HAVE MEN ON THE MOON, BUT I CAN'T HAVE GOOD QUALITY SOUND IN A AFTER MARKET STEREO BECAUSE ITS A MERCEDES ???? !!!!!  I went on line, looked for good reviews, found Pacific Stereo , in a lot of the reviews I saw Andy name.  I called and I asked for Andy, with in 24 hours, I had a new system, he knew exactly what i needed, all at a great price!  I will never bring my car anywhere else!  PACIFIC STEREO,  ANDY IS ALWAYS WHO I WILL GO TO FOR NOW ON!!  THANK YOU ANDY, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, I LOVE MY SYSTEM SO MUCH, I DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT OF MY CAR! LOL  HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

This guy is a rude hack that has zero respect for anyone asking questions and offers no constructive criticism. He also has no patience with his fellow man which tells me that his work is shoddy and lacks expertise, and is most likely hurried which leaves large margins for error.< /text>

<review>I've been dealing with Joe, Gus and there staff for around four years now.  I'm one of those hard to please customers.  Joe and his staff always deliver top quality service.  Wiether it's on the sales floor or in the installation bay. Joe is very effective in making sure your happy.
Joe and his staff are very appreciative on returning customers.  And more so for the ones who refer family and friends.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcb0b3557c23c9:0x68125917e142e62b<//gmap_id></record>

Because the economy is doing “well”! A small business, like Pacific Stereo is doing well. They are facing many challenges, one being customer service. I dropped off my car thirty minutes ahead of my appt with a quoted 3-4 hour time frame to complete my service only to realize 3 hours later they did not start the job and would require an additional two hours. With respect to the guy behind the counter, he did offer to service my job for free however, my work schedule didn't allow me the day off. So I bumped up my 1 star review to 2 stars

Buyer beware, read their last 6 months of reviews and make an educated spending decision…< /Text>

I have brought all my cars to get systems installed along with HID conversions. They're work quality is high and they're prices aren't the best BUT I deeply believe in "you get what you pay for". Wait time always varies when they're busy its almost impossible to get your car done quick. Just have patience.</text>

One of the best stereo shops in Southern California. Believe me I know. They have Brands there that other shops have never heard of... So for an audio Freak Like Me this is the only place where I can get my Crack.

Although I've been installing since the 80s. These people do top-notch work too</text>

<text>Awesome service. Excellent price for what you get. I got an alarm from them to replace a total crap alarm I bought from their competitors. The install was supper clean. All connections are soldered and heat shrunk, with corrugated plastic that look OEM. These guys really know their stuff. I just went back for some speakers. Again great service. Chris is really professional, really knowledgeable, straight forward guy. I couldn't be happier with both products. Totally earned all 5 stars!!!</text><name>Mark Lybbert</name>< Pictures>

i own a 2015 Dodge Charger. Aftermarket in dash DVD units are practically non existent for my model. Andy helped me out and worked really hard to find a solution for my problem. Unfortunately, we were not able to get exactly what i hoped for. Not their fault, a complaint ill def have with dodge, But we found a middle ground to solve my issue and even had a new alarm and remote start installed as well. Service was always exceptional, and Andy went above and beyond to make sure i was happy with the results. My first time with Pacific Stereo and will def be a repeat customer.</Text>

I got a new radio with Bluetooth, speakers and back up camera put in my Honda Accord in January. It was cheaper than I expected and done very quickly. It works perfectly and I've had no issues with it.< /review>

Great Customer service.  They get the job done right.  The sound system I had installed in my vehicle sounds awesome.   Would definitely use them again and recommend them to my friends.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Pacific Stereo!!!!    After having many issues from horrible installs by another shop, I ended up at Pacific Stereo.   Joe (owner) has been very helpful with me since my first visit.   I have had many minor-difficult issues from previous installer's errors and Joe and his crew of installers at Pacific Stereo have taken care of everything and fixed everything.   This places falls nothing short of being a top notch...from the guys inside the store to the guys installing your products.  Everyone here is friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable.  Their product selection is endless, from bottom of the line products to the top of the line products.   Even if it's a few extra miles to drive to Pacific Stereo...stop by and check them out.    You will not be disappointed!!!   Thanks again Joe and Pacific Stereo!!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Be very careful what you buy from this place.  We bought an amp for our boat and found out that we had 2 free channels on the amp we already had in the boat so we didn't need it.  The amp we bought was never opened and still in the box.  They will not give you your money back and we are out $214.00!  Pretty bogus!  there are too many places that will treat you better don't buy from them!</Text><Time>1435014936752<//Time></record></dataset><record>

The staff at this location is amazing. My 5th project was just completed by them (a golf cart) and it sounds amazing. Joe and Meemo are the guys I deal with, although anyone there will make you a Raving Fan. When it comes to customizing work your imagination can become a reality at a fair price. I have been dealing with them for years and recommend all of my friends to them. They have worked on my motorcycle, pickup golf cart, truck, my son's mustang and all of it is above and beyond my expectations. You should go and talk with them about your needs and wants and they will make it come true. I highly recommend using them and you won't be disappointed. They don't do cheap work for a cheap price, they do great work for a fair price. If you want it done right and to sound right the first time go see Joe and the team at Pacific Stereo on Indiana and Tyler.</text>

You can truly judge a company based upon their customer service when exchanging an item or addressing a warranty concern.  These people sell and install stereo electronics but do not stand behind the product.
You've been warned!  Spend your money elsewhere!< /Text>

Avoid ever doing mail order with Pacific Stereo.  Terrible customer service.  Ordered parts and paid for expedited shipping.  Item not sent out the same day and eventually took 5 days to reach me.  Sending item back at my expense.  No refund for late shipping and they extract a 15% restocking fee.  Take your business elsewhere!< /Review>

Cost me almost $650 to have them install aftermarket equipment I owned already, and remove my factory system, and half my aftermarket features don’t even work correctly! Never had issues with the equipment when it was in my previous vehicle! I’ve had to go back 3 different occasions and they claim nothing’s wrong! When I bought the equipment brand new and installed at another shop it cost me $800 and change, yet costs me almost the same to have them install what I already own, and it doesn’t even work! This shop is a joke! Now I have to pay another shop to fix their mistakes and it’s cost me time and money and doesn’t even work properly because they do half-assed work! They also caused damage to my car when they broke the trunk liner! And my remote start is screwed up as well! Explain to me how this shop is still even in business?!?!<//Review>

<Review>Great tint job, took care of me really well, took my old tint off and put new one on in record time, normally a 5+ hour job they did it in 2 hours, Brand new tinter that did a great job and didn't stain my interior with the wet towel like my last tinter, even looked up my sound system specs to make sure I got the cleanest sound possible.

I've been a customer of Pacific Stereo for the past few years and have had a lot of work done for my cars and I've never been let down. The manager Joe has been a pleasure to work with. He really knows his stuff and is always willing to help you get what you want. He isn't out there to make a quick buck, he wants you to leave happy. If there's a specific sound you're looking for or you have a certain amount to spend, you can always count on Joe to set you up for the most bang for your buck. I've always recommended Pacific Stereo to my friends and family and they usually come back satisfied. If there has been any problems with them, I always tell them to talk to Joe and he'll get it done right, no matter what the issue is. So if you have any issues or problems, TALK TO JOE. YOU WILL LEAVE HAPPY.<//text>

<text>Had made an early appointment with Andy for a Saturday. I showed up before they opened and once I talked with Andy he acted like he did not remember of my appointment. I showed him his business card he had given me a week ago with a quote of the price. He was going to take two cars before me and wanted me to leave the truck for the entire day after he has said I was going be the first one taken. I am very disappointed at their customer service and that they can't keep their word.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb0b3557c23c9:0x68125917e142e62b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm VERY PLEASED with the head unit (Alpine CDE - 143 BT) that Juan sold me, along with a pair of Rockford Fosgate 6X9 speakers. He said they would work together well, & he was right!  It sounds great! I was in & out of the store in under 20 minutes because of his knowledge & expertise! Good job Juan!  I will definitely recommend Pacific Stereo, AND Juan!< /Review>

This place needs to re-think there sales team. Came in for an RGB LED strip and the guy says it's the brightest on the market but didn't want to power it up. What an idiot. I said if it's not not quality then I'm leaving bad feed back. Didn't even want to sell it to me. Just power it up and make a sale. Soooo stupid. BEWARE!!!!< /text>

<Review>I came to Pacific Stereo to have a dash cam installed and hardwired into my vehicle along with a voltage cut-off battery discharge preventer.  Do to no fault of their own, I had to return to have the discharge preventer uninstalled since it was not compatible with my dash cam.  Even though it required more labor on their part, Andy did not charge me any further and had the part removed for free.  Everything is working great now, and I will definitely be returning here for any further work I need done on my car!<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>At first, I wasn't to sure about dealing with pacific stereo mainly due to other reviews. When I decided to install a pioneer double din head unit and jl audio amps along with jl audio speakers and subs, I first went to Amazon. But, I went in to pacific stereo just to get wires and a fuse holder and ended up buying everything from here. Joe gave me the best price I could find. All the adapters like the plastic trim, wire harness adapter, and antenna adapter, all worked as advertised. They were also helpful when I needed help wiring up the head unit. Its nice to have a place that will give you decent prices and not rip you off like best buy. I'll will definitely buy from this place again when I decide to do my truck next.< /Review>< Pics>

Over the many years I've come here, and the various cars Ive brought for various installs. Ive learned TWO things . ONE is that they are always happy to sell you a product, take your money, and make it seem like an easy process. TWO.... They never stand behind thier products or thier installation after you've handed the cash over. They are Incredibly rude once your car is out of the shop and has to come back even for simple reasons. On countless ocassions I have wasted time, money and gas just for thier mistakes. I eventually decided to have thier work inspected by a professional whose job is to design and produce car alarms and have been told, "Thier wire cutting/installation and lack of attention to detail is not only a fire hazard but is something between monkeywork and just plain laziness." If thats not bad enough I CANT forget to mention that they always make plenty of extra scratches to your vehicle that they never take responsibility for. Overpriced to begin with and horrible customer service, who has time to deal with a lousy shop over and over again. There are many aftermarket stores in the area. Dont waste your time on this one.</Text>

Quality Excellent

If you are in the market to upgrade your car audio system it would be in your best interest to swing by Pacific Stereo before you go anywhere else! Aside from their knowledgable staff, reasonable prices and huge inventory these guys have the absolute BEST customer service your money can buy hands down!!! Im a first time customer and came in for a car alarm, new head unit, small amp and an 8inch sub with a custom box for my Chevy Colorado at the Riverside location on the corner of Tyler and Indiana just south of the mall. The guys at this location (namely Jose) went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure my satisfaction with the services they performed and I COULD NOT be HAPPIER. Jose even showed some Christmas Spirit and hooked me up with brand new out of the box Alpine speakers to replace the stock ones in the doors at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!!! Who does that anymore? Sure I spent more than a couple of hours at the shop (which is why I think that Christmas Spirit came out) but hey, you cant rush the quality you get here or beat their customer satisfaction guarantee. Besides all that this place is a family friendly business with a comfortable lounge area where you and the kids can sit and watch all the sponge bob and power rangers you want on netflix or shop around in the neighboring businesses a stones throw away. I highly recommend Pacific Stereo to everyone looking to put a system in their ride and strongly urge you to ask for Jose. This guy hooked me up and I know he'll hook you up too! Thank you so much Jose and the whole Pacific Stereo team! Have a very Merry Christmas and God bless you all.</Text>

<username>F1 Racer</username><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>5</Rate><Review>This is a relatively laid back outfit, the largest car stereo shop I've come across anywhere. I dealt with Chris, who manages this local shop. What stood out for me compared to other shops I've tried around SoCal is that there's no high-pressure sales tactics, prices are reasonable, and the shop looks well run and organized. ( DO you know how hard it is to just find a shop with these attributes around SoCal?? not easy). Most other shops will try and up sell you unnecessarily, play games with installation and parts charges(inflated costs), and charge as much as they can get, kinda like how it is buying a car from a dealership, and we all know how much we love those experiences. The purchase process went smoothly. Chris was accommodating on the installation and got it done quickly. Now comes the real reason why I gave this outfit a five star. The installation was rushed a bit due to time constraints on my part, as a result, it also caused some errors to occur during installation. Both front woofer were damaged. The rubber surround edge were broken probably when the installer was securing the speaker. Now I found this out a week later after hearing some rattling, and wanted to install some dynamat. I called Chris and texted him a picture of each speaker, and discussed the issue. Chris was very responsive, and took care of the issue the very next day. He replaced them with new woofers. What's important about customer service isn't when everything goes well, it's when things don't go as planned. While my purchase experience didn't go perfectly smooth, but I leaned something about how Pacific stereo does business, their customer service focus, business integrity, and ethics. JFK puts it best " don't let an error become a mistake by refusing to fix it". More importantly, it tells me that this outfit is batting for the long game, and that is a good thing for the community it serves. Bravo.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dcb0b3557c23c9:0x68125917e142e62b<//gmapID>< time>

Not worth the money or time. They over price and can't get the Job done right. I've been backto them 3 times and something there added to my car keeps meesing up. Didn't argue with the price so I could get in and get out but they did terrible work in my car. The speakers I bought last month aren't working. They messed up the Bluetooth on my car. And they lock system won't work unless I'm standing right next to my car. I was thinking of you're going to sell a product make sure it gets done right the first time so ppl will keep coming back. But it shows how much there employees care<//Text>

i went to Discount Tire Centers after I was told at another shop that i needed extensive work done on my car. I wanted another estimate. Their honesty saved me $550.00 ! I have used Discount tire in the past and they have been great. I recommend Discount Tire center in Orange and in Lake Forest highly for honest and affordable tires and repairs. I wont ever use another shop again. Thank you for not trying to sell me anything and for being honest with me. You have earned my loyalty and trust.<//review>

<Review>Great service! So my personal mechanic retired after going to them for over 20 years and I had to find a new mechanic. I was referred to others that were "reliable" only to find out things like brakes were not being inspected. Discount Tire checks the whole car and recommends what is needed.  They have never recommended services that were not needed. In fact I have been told "if you would like to pay for it we can do it, but it is not needed at this time." I was sold! I recommend them highly if you are looking for a reliable mechanic. Mark (front desk) reminds me of my grandfather and our previous mechanic, he is an asset to this location! Again, I cant recommend this Discount Tire enough!< /Review><Date>1621878411979<//Date>< Resp>

<text>My experience..... They ordered me some tires for my truck.. paid for the tires the service almost $1000.00
They didn't give me no warranty on the tires or service..they said I'd have to pay another $160.00 more for the warranty . The tires don't have manufacturing warranty neither...i was not told this before purchasing them or ordering them.. Not till it was ready for me to pay.  I would think as well known as they are they would give a warranty on their product and not want to charge extra for it.. I understand when they charge extra for extended warranty.
So yes not really satisfied with discount Tires<//text><user>106948663401835517596< /user>< gmapID>

Told me the price over the phone for the one new tire I needed .  Scheduled it for 2pm the next day.  Arrived at 1:30pm and they took me in early, which was great.  They checked me in and told me how long it was going to take.  They also found that my car needed an alignment.  Total time that it took was about an hour.  The person who took care of me was nice, friendly and personable.  Everyone working there was wearing a mask and took precautions for Covid.  Would definitely go back.  Thanks for the great service!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I double checked — they charged me less than half what the dealer wanted (and that’s with the OEM parts factored in). I had both rear wheel bearings replaced on a 2011 Prius, and from what I understand, they are tricky to replace. Brought my car in at 9 and it was ready by 12noon. They were professional, courteous and friendly. Ask for John. His customer service was excellent. By the way, the technician also came out to check that everything was ok. Can’t believe I waited this long. Make sure you go to the right location. Google maps will take you to America’s Tire. Don’t go there. Double check the address. 144 N. Tustin in Orange<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I was very surprised when after they spent about an hour removing, fixing and checking to make sure it was fixed, they gave me the bill for the repair.  Just before that my friends I was talking with had said, Oh, when they see you beautiful Corvette Z06 don't expect a deal, they will probably charge you an arm and a leg!  WOW!  No Charge, with friendly  and great service!  It helped make my day after having already had a very difficult and challenging day with my  corvette Dealer telling me they only wanted to replace the almost $500 tire without even looking at it and the closest tire shop near by telling me it would be 20 to 30 minutes before they would even talk with me.  I highly recommend this Discount tire center on Tustin Ave off Chapman in Orange, CA.  They know what great customer service is!!!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I did not feel confident after having used Discount Tires. After replacing my tires, I was told my car was finished. I realized Bailey had neglected to put my hubcaps on. I had to ask for them. I don’t think I’ll be using your store in Orange again.

<text>Positives: AAA members receive free tire patch (some stipulations apply), same day service.
Negatives: waiting for technician to patch tire took over 1 hour (I believe there was only 2 techs working today, so i understand the wait times), nowhere to wait during service.
Average overall experience at a tire shop.<//text>< Pictures>

We took my daughter's car in for 2 tires and an oil change.  When she left, there were several warning lights appearing on her dashboard, and her speedometer did not work.  My daughter returned and after her car was looked at for a few minutes, she left in tears after being told it wasn't anything they did.  Not a single problem was exhibiting before going in there, so obviously something happened there, and they denied all responsibility.  We're not finished with this matter.< /review>

Awesome deal on tires! I went to American tires before and paid $500 and decided to shop elsewhere this go around and paid less than $180! I decided to get my brakes and rotors done because it was so dang cheap and they stayed open an extra hour to make sure my car was done. Really efficient and fast. Dropped my car off and picked it up about 2 and half hours later. On top of that, I got a sick coupon for Snow Valley for 4 lift tickets because I spent $300

Couldn't find a better deal anywhere!</Review>

I’m very disappointed with the service I received. Took my car in to fix the tire that had a nail in it. When I got it back and drove off I realized the tire barely had any pressure and the others had not been checked like the paperwork said. Took it back and the employee that helped me gave me a real attitude like he was annoyed that he had to help me. The next day my tire was completely flat. I’m told that they cut into the edge of the tire when they were putting it back on the rim so the tire was ruined. I had to purchase a new one from someone else became their shop was closed on Sunday. I think I should be reimbursed for it and will not be going back there again.< /review>

I went in yesterday afternoon because I put too much fix a flat in my tire because of a slow leek and my car was bumping around on the freeway. I went in to have them look at it and was expecting to pay to have it fixed. To my surprise they were able to clean out the fix a flat, took a screw out of my tire and fix the tire best part was it didn’t cost me anything. You guys are amazing! Thanks again!< /text>

Discount Tire Center is the best! I wouldn't go anywhere else for my tire needs.
They've always been very fair with pricing and show you all the options to keep you within Budget.

I've bought tires for my last three vehicles there and will continue to come back. The service is always top tier.<//text>

<Date>1575488568316<//Date><review>What a wonderful tire shop. Such and ethical and honest team. I highly, highly, highly recommend this job. Mark was amazing!

This is my story: so, seven months ago (5/5/19) I took my car to a Pep Boys for an oil change. After the oil change, the service writer informed me that I needed to change my brakes and have the rotors resurfaced as well as new tires. I got a quote of $250 for the brakes but no quote for the tires. That seemed like a steep price so I decided to shop around and get a second quote.

Well today, 7 months later, I finally had time to take my car for a second quote on the brakes and tires at Discount Tire Center. To my surprise, Mark informed me that my brakes and tires were just fine and they still had plenty of life left so I walked out of Discount Tire Center with peace of mind and grateful that Mark and the team was so honest, friendly, and ethical.

I applaud Discount Tire Center for their amazing service. I am now a Discount Tire Center customer for life!< /review>< gmapID>

On Friday afternoon my wife and I took my truck in to get five tires put on new rims. My wife knows more about cars and what needed to be done than I do she asked the redhead a service writer to replace the 4 tires and rims that were on the truck with smaller tires original to the truck,  With the five rims in the back of the truck. Which clearly would require five tires. We agreed on the price and when the mechanic came in to get the paperwork from the service writer he kept saying for tires four tires my wife questioned him and rather than having told us he only had four tires was just going to sell us four tires. She had said something to me about feeling like he was treating her "like a woman" as if she didn't know what she was talking about. My wife was a service writer for her families auto repair business for 20 years she's quite attuned to misogyny in the auto repair business. She originally had blown it off as it was hot and everybody's cranky right now. We both felt at that point that she was not imagining things.

We had requested smaller tires to fix a speedometer issue the tires he sold us it turns out we're not smaller and not the original size to the truck, they just simply fit 16 inch rims now we're out $850 including disposal fees for tires that we still have in our possessionSince we told him to leave the tires on the rims and just put them in the back of the truck. And my speedometer still doesn't work. I will say the truck does drive nicer, I am a loyal discount tire customer I have never been treated poorly in the past by any discount tire person this time will make me think about coming back to any discount in the future.< /Review>

<review>Very professional and fast service.  Pricing was good.  I have always gone to America's Tire, but usually I would spend $500.  I got a lot more service for just $400.  Tires, oil change and rear brake service.  So thank you.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I showed up at discount tire on Friday, Jan 24,2020 with my work van driving with no brakes and totally stressed out.   Darrell Camu went out of his way to get my work van back on the road as quick as possible.   He hunted for parts that Ford said were on back order in the whole United States, he could had just waited for the parts to come in from back order but that is not how he works,  he searched and found the parts in Wilmington, Ca and had my van on the road the next day.    Darrell understood that van was my way of working and earning an income and gave 1000 percent effort in getting it back in safe working order.   I am very satisfied with all the guys strong work ethic at discount tire in Orange,  a good team needs a great leader and Darrell Camu is that.

DISCOUNT TIRE at 114 north Tustin is my place to go

Thank you Darrell and your crew.   Job well done.< /text>< Time>

I showed up 15 minutes before opening and they were happy to accommodate.I thought I had run over a screw and I was afraid to remove it myself for fear of my tire going flat on the way to the tire shop. Upon inspection it was found that the screw had not punctured my tire, they removed it and sent me on my way! They were courteous and honest and fast and friendly!<//text>

<username>Sarah Moon</username>< Review>
Came from out of town for Thanksgiving vacation, and came here to patch a nail leak. There wasn’t particularly friendly customer service. Waited 1.5 hours in a cold and uncomfortable waiting area only for them to tell us that the tire was too worn and they will not patch it. Policies are policies and that’s not their fault but we could have avoided the time wasted. The guy came out to get our vehicle info; that would have been a great time for us to be informed that they would not be patching our tires. It was incredibly frustrating.</Review>

<Review>This location is always very good and they are very considerate, I have had bad Experiences at Just Tires(Orange) and Ramona Tires, ( various locations)  Ramona  breaks something on your car and then they charge you for it. I will continue to use this location for any of my automotive needs. I will also recommend this location in particular.

My car broke down and I was across the street from DTC. I needed to drive another 70 miles. They were able to fix my car within 30 minutes and at a low cost where I could have been charged hundreds of dollars. I was grateful and appreciative of the help I received and their honesty.</review>

I took my car in because my low tire pressure light went on for two days in a row.  I got my tire repaired for no charge.  It took me about 45 minutes total at the Solo Tire.  Would recommend them to others.< /text>

<Text>Superb service. My truck rides smooth as ever and Mark made sure the alignment was perfect. The guys did a great job installing big ol’37s, expeditiously and w/great care. Darryl gave me best price ever and trust, I shopped. Made me grateful I went with BFG T/A KO2. Checked my brakes, checked my frame(was in collision) no charge and did not waste a minute of anybody’s time. Would Never go anywhere else. Plan on going back for my other automotive needs; brakes, oil change, shocks and of course, all my tire snd alignment maintenance. It’s good to find someone you can trust to handle your Baby. Thank you, DT Orange.<//Text>< UserId.>

The customer service of the person at the front desk was absolutely phenomenal. Easily five stars. The mechanical work and care of the car was very substandard. I was there simply for a new tire. I was able to change my flat tire in the middle of the night with standard car equipment in under 10 minutes. It took these guys over half an hour to change my tire. They seem to go in stages; one guy would do something for a while and then walk away. A while later another guy would show up and do something then walk away. Then eventually  The first guy would come back and do something and walk away.   And by the way, it’s not like they had a lot of cars they were working on simultaneously. It was mostly empty.
After I changed my tire I left all the stuff in the back because I knew they would have to take everything out to put my spare away.  Later I come to find out when they were done they took all of my tire-changing equipment and just dumped it into the back of the car.  The only thing they put back was the spare tire  and they didn’t even screw it back into place.  Some, if not many mechanics, will put your stuff away for you; clearly they did not.  So five stars for the woman at the front desk. Two stars for the mechanics.  I can’t give 3 1/2 average, so I gave three because of the laziness of the mechanics.</text>

Discount Tire Center took over this location, previously ran and owned by a private business owner. I was a customer from the previous business owner.  Not only did Paul honored my previous contract, he also took care of my concerns and vehicle needs diligently. The mechanics are a hard working bunch. Thank you for the awesome experience.< /Text>

Went in with a flat tire and the manager of the store immediately found a screw and repaired at no cost. This is why I have always bought my tires from Discount Tires.</Text>

The price that was given by the call center (Brian, very professional), the store manager (Paul) did not want to honor it when I took the car in next day for replacing 4 tires. He had bad attitude from beginning. It took much longer for service , since Paul had to do price match , which should have been completed before I got to the store since I had an appointment with actual reference quote #.
After going back and forth, they eliminated the insurance from the quote and did not change the TPMs, for the price given to me by the call center.
They also charged for 4 tire disposal, when I told them I want 2 good tires back, and all 4 tire pressures are wrong ( set at 32 vs 37) after driving out of the store.<//text>

Went in for testing, related to my job. I was greeted by knowledgeable front staff.
The facility was clean and modern. Safe distancing was practiced comfortably, mask were warn. My nurse/technician was friendly and efficient. It was a pleasant, quick visit!</Review>

I was under a time constraint and had to visit on a Monday. It appears that is their busiest days. The staff at the front desk admitted, "we are understaffed." Many people were given hours for a wait time before seeing a clinician.  Once in back, the staff was nice and the appointment moved along swiftly. Staff is always polite despite the fast pace and endless lines.<//Text>

The people are nice the lady was really trying to help rather than send me away.  She was running in heels funny but thank you so much for going out of your way.  Besides they told me 2-3 hrs and offer to call me when my turn I was done in less than 1.< /text>

I give this place a 1 because I called and made a 3 o’clock appointment before going in. When I got there I checked in with the front desk and told her I had an appointment. Not sure if she forgot or just didn’t care so I waited in lobby for 1.5 hours before going back to front desk to talk to another person who apologized to me and told me she didn’t know I had an appointment, otherwise I would’ve been seen earlier. Front desk is very unprofessional< /Review>

0 stars if it was a option! I got here at 3:00pm waited 2 hours, and the workers still harassed me. One of the workers even told me “i should get fired from my job” another was rushing me to urine telling me to “hurry up”. They were un professional in all the services i was provided. They need to get trained on customer service. This is a clinic were people should feel safe and i wasn't treated fairly nobody should feel this way!< /review>

< Review>
Asked for organ damage bloodwork . Was told no need since It appeared no fractures were seen. I asked just to be sure I didn’t have any internal bleeding or bruised organs I’d like bloodwork . Was given same answer . The next day I went to my private physician and told him about the injury I sustained and without asking him he immediately said he wanted to check spleen, kidneys , heart etc. did complete bloodwork panel and ekg to be sure my organs were ok. I can’t understand why the Urgent care physician assistant wouldn’t take the same precautions even while seeing the pain I was in and the fall I had . Amateur hour<//Review>

I was sent the the Compton/Carson location to drug test for a new job. While checking in, I should have been informed by the front desk staff that there was a 2 hour wait time. After an hour of waiting, I asked how much longer was the wait and was told that there was 3 people in front of me which was for injuries and it would be a little wait. I asked if I could come back the next morning and was told that because my paperwork was already scanned, if I came back the next day I would need a new order. I’ve had to drug test a few times in the past for jobs and I’ve never experienced a wait time like that. My appointment lasted all of 5 minutes once I was called in. Hopefully I will never have to go to Concentra EVER AGAIN!!!< /review>

<review>Great customer service! Eventhough it was a bit busy the ladies upfront were courteous! The guy in the back doing the drug test explained steps throughly. This is the first time I go into a clinic where the workers are pleasant and don't act like they are better than everyone else! Also, thought it was a clean
establishment.<//review><Time>1604957922807</Time>< Pictures>

<Review>My experience with Concentra has been very very good.  All the people,  Doctor's,  Nurses and the other staff members show much respect and concern for the comfort to me as a client.  If the wait time could be shortened it would make it a perfect place.  However I understand that can't be helped sometime.  Yet Concentra is a great place for treatment.  Non better...😊< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
It took awhile to actually get called in for my pre-employment physical. This was due to them not knowing the address of my employer. I called the county to get it and gave it to the women at the desk. It was the official address which they did not have in their system so told me it was wrong. I said that I just called them to verify it but the office staff would not put it down as I wrote it and used what they had. Since my results are going to an outside agency contracted by my employer, I’m sure they will send it to the correct address. Once I was taken back for the tests it went quicker and my MA was very nice. I saw the MD for just a minute. The whole appointment took longer than I anticipated but I had quite a few tests done.<//Review>

The tech I had helping me on Friday  April 24,2020 was grouchy at best.  He seemed like he did not want to be there. He also did not follow protocol  when collecting my urine sample.  He didn't dye the toilet blue and did not even check the toilet for urine adulteration after collecting my sample. He instructed me to flush my own urine sample and never walked into the bathroom.  When flushing my own urine I had lost sight of my samples for about 20 to 30 seconds before he put the tamper proof labels on them. ( A and B samples) He also told me to quote " don't take to long" when sending me in to pee. I am a professional driver that gets sent in for a random drug screen 3 to 4 times a year and have never been treated so rudely ever!!!<//text>

Minimum wait, everybody courteous.  I had white coat syndrome so they let me relax in a dark room.  That did the trick and they passed my blood pressure.
Thank you!  Out the door in great time, see you next year (71 years old).<//review>

As someone who has fainted every time I have had blood drawn or a TB test, you can only imagine how anxious I was during this experience. Fransisco and Rian were so empathetic to my wimpy sensitivities, that I DID NOT FAINT. As someone who is very embarrassed about my fear of needles, I appreciated that these two did everything to make me feel comfortable and even hung out with me until I was in good shape to go home.

Out of three the Concentra locations I’d called this was the only place that offered TSpot. The wait time was ok not great but I understand because it was a full lobby. Good communications between the staffs and patients. Awesome job.<//review>

I was there for a pre-employment exams. Yes the wait time was long but it was a full lobby and I can see the girls in front working hard and trying their best to communicate with the patients regarding the wait time. The back office staffs was non stop moving so I can see they’re extremely busy. I over heard their conversation when I was waiting about Torrance’s toilet was not working and they were overwhelmed from their patients coming in<//text>

I was injured at work and explained to the drs of the pain and where it was located only to find out they were focused in one part only. I've been coming in and out of here for months now their sending me to work with no changes done what so ever. I'm still in pain and no one seems to hear me out . Worst place to come and treat an injury .<//Text>

Checked in for a Company Random Drug Test on 08SEP2020 waited 2 1/2 hrs. To make it worse I was skipped twice for no reason, talked to the Supervisor and was told she was going to ask the nurse why I got skipped. If you have a choice go some place else☹️</text>

Truly unacceptable service. I had to come here for pre-employment screening in which I had to wait for 3 hours prior to being seen. Once I was called back , they didn’t even have the correct procedures I needed to have done. I corrected them and then had to wait an additional 20-30 min. Because it was so late at this point, they did half of the criteria and asked me to come back a following time in which I would be the first person to be seen. I was agreeable, came back, and yet had to wait another HOUR to be seen. They said I had to be re-registered. Again, they did not have the correct procedures I needed to have done which I again corrected and was then forced to wait another 40 min. After the procedures were done, they sent me to the waiting room to wait for the paperwork to be signed. I waited for 20 min prior to going to check with the front desk where I found the PAPERS WERE SIGNED AND SITTING THERE for who knows how long. They couldn’t give me a reason as to why I was waiting. This place is beyond unorganized, I would advise finding another facility if possible.</Text>

<Review>It’s a good place to go but leaves much to wonder if you are being serviced to really aid you or the company that you are working for.  It’s been two weeks and I’m still waiting for medications that I never received

Can we rate any less than 1 star? This place is ridiculous online and when you call the automated system it says open 24 hours. I went on a Sunday morning and all the doors were closed, when I finally able to get through to someone they wouldn’t even see me they told me to go to an emergency room; basically just didn’t want to say they wouldn’t open the door. Beyond unprofessional!!!< /review>

< Review>
Pleasant Dr. And staff - the girls at the front desk do their best working against the back offices in terms of getting paperwork complete from Health insurance department.  The health insurance department holds on to paperwork for a lengthy time and charges A big fee for completion and will not take or return phone calls.   Health insurance is extremely important
And the long wait (7-14 days) -holding back on this form and large fee getting it filled out is unfair and doesn’t seem reasonable what so ever, why the charge?   Other than this issue the front desk works very hard to accommodate the best they can.  I would rate 5 stars but because of the health insurance paperwork dejay abd fee I will rate a 3.<//Review>

Worst experience ever i came here to do a pre-employment which i was told to come after 7 because its 24/7 and i wouldn't wait in line i came around 9:37 pm where i was greeted by a nurse he was the one that told me they couldn't do the process he said he would try to talk to the doctor if they can do it but he told me it depended on the doctor that my process would only take 10 to 15 minutes , when he came back from talking to him he said he didnt have time at all and said come back tommorow ! I then called the torrence location they told me to come and they attended me and let me know that they werent supposed to do that i admire there honesty and there time thank you and the staff .</text>

Never judge a book by its cover, be bold enough to take a look inside. The office is Clean, organized, FRIENDLY!!!, and respectful of your time, I never had a more efficient and professional experience in healthcare delivery. I entered the building through the wrong side and was escorted (not just told a series L/R turns) to where I need to be. I had an appointment but was taken to the hospital back before I could sit down after signing in. Wow!<//Review>

<Review>If you don't have the common cold or work related minor injury they won't see you. Had stitches that were visible just needed to check out to make sure they were not infected. Simple check and the turned me away cause they didn't do the surgery. What's the point of urgent care if they just refer you to the ER.< /Review>< Pics>

Came in to about 10 people in the waiting room and an hour later after all those people are gone I have yet to be helped, any other place I go to to take a drug screen is never over an hour from start to finish and I came in before 8:30am on a Wednesday. This had be pretty frustrated.</review>

My only problem was the wait time but there were a lot of people and one guy did cut in front of me at the counter. I was standing in the line and he came up to the counter in the middle of the office instead of behind me and the girl took him  also the computer the other girl works from totally blocks the people in line. So no wonder she saw him and not me<//text>

(Translated by Google) people try to cheat on the drug test. that's why people have to wait. don't yell at people who just do the job. the other clinic rejected me because it was busy.

la gente intenta hacer trampa en la prueba de drogas. por eso la gente tiene que esperar. no le grites a la gente que solo hace el trabajo. la otra clínica me rechazó porque estaba ocupada.< /Text>

< Review>
This is a beautiful beach, but the hike down is pretty steep. Be careful on the way down to beach stairs are very steep. Beautiful once you get to the beach!<//Review>

Beautiful location! Can't beat the views! The trail down to the beach is unpaved with many steps (not handicapped accessable), no railings, be careful with small children and elderly. Great place to hang out for the day, bring a lunch and maybe beach umbrella as there is no shade. Bathrooms are in the parking lot area and so are garbages. Clean up after yourselves to keep the beach trash free! Go during low tide to check out the tide pools, we saw a variety of sea life including two giant star fish!<//Text>

Beautiful area. Easy access to the beach and trails north and south. During lowish tide you can walk to multiple beaches and be totally alone. Tide pools galore and lovely views from the trails.<//Review>

I love it! Great scenery shots! Worth it! There's a 1.5 mile hike to get to Carlaveros beach! So a total of 3miles.. the beach is beautiful! I was lucky that I got there during sunset time.. it was very windy, so always come prepared with a sweater or jacket to keep warm!</text>

<Review>It's a bit smelly, rocky, and kelpy. Also, the trail down is a little treacherous. But the two random seals popping their heads up occasionally was a nice touch. Would recommend going down the road further to Wrights.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>
<user>106640605082321618575< /user><username>Nick Smith</username><review>Nice, small beach. As the name implies, there is an abundance of shells which is swell. Look out for sea lions! Also, check out the trail by the parking lot before heading down to the beach; it’s an easy walk and well worth it.<//review>< Pictures>

Great secluded beach with lots of sand and rocks. Like all the beaches along here, you have to go down the stairs to get to the beach.</Text>

Beautiful place for a  easywalk, great views of the ocean and hills. Teaming with wild life, watch for hawks,  ravens, crows, gulls, pelicans, and deer. Great spot for whale watching during migration and dont forget your picnic. NO DOGS on trails, I know you love your dogs but this is a Wildlife Protected trail, watched an unleashed dog run down a Fawn yesterday, lucklily the little deer got away. Keep your dog at home on in the car Please.< /review>

Cannot say enough about this company, the founder and the product line.  Amazing results.  Value for the cost.  Ability to offset purchases with a few referrals and even make a profit.  Great concept.< /Text>

<Text>Love it!  It's only been 4 weeks.   I can now squat down at store for item on bottom self, without having to pull myself up.   My ankles and knees don't ache from getting down in that position.   Better sleep,  and since I've been using gel no more bathroom trips in middle of the night.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Customer service NEVER answers emails or phone calls....So frustrated with this company.  If its such a great product, you would think they would have better customer service.  Very unsatisfied and will not be ordering from this company EVER.< /review>

I have never found a health product that makes me feel as fantastic as this homeopathic gel makes me feel! I am sleeping better than I have in years, my post menopausal hot flashes have been eradicated, my mood is so much happier (no more Seasonal Affective Disorder) and I have energy like I did in my 30’s. I will never stop taking this product!<//text>

This gel has helped my Rheumatoid so much!  Not cured, but feeling a lot better.  It also has helped my IBS-D, and my sleep.  I love the gel!</Review>

<Text>I had an issue and was able to get through quickly and it was resolved.  I was speaking to a new CS rep and she said they have hired lots of new CS reps.  I did have trouble getting through in the past but it looks like they are fixing that problem. I’ve used the product for 3 mths and have had great results.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I love the products! I started with the HGH gel a year ago and within 2 nights I was sleeping well for the first time in a long time! I have more energy and focus and heal much quicker from injuries. With the KG4, it’s so easy to lose body fat. I drink it in the morning with breakfast and then just watch my carbs. Customer service is great and very helpful!<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I love my gel.  After thyroid cancer I could not seem to bounce back. I was exhausted all the time and it through me into menapause. It took a few months but so glad I didn't give up.  I have not felt this great in 15 years .  I have great energy, amazing sleep, my hair stopped falling out and is now thicker and fuller. Hot flashes are gone as well as mood swings. My joint pain is much less to .  And now have started the KG4 drink and losing those pesky 20 lbs I gained from the thyroid cancer. I am so so glad my nurse practitioner told me about the gel.  Life changing for me!! Thanks to the Gel I got my life bac .  All I can say is go for it.  You will not regret it.< /text>< pictures>

All good things! I can't say enough GOOD things about this company. New U Life is absolutely amazing. I work here at corporate with the executives, and I can honestly say everyone is positively concerned about doing the right thing! They have great products, SOMADERM Gel and KetoGe4, and they have an awesome field of distributors! If you haven't heard about New U Life yet, you will, and it will be ALL GOOD things!<//Review>

Ordered it to give it a try.  They charged my card over $500 called to dispute no call back. No email follow up.  Rep tells me that she will take care of it.  Package came anyway......fast forward a month few emails to cancel and bang my card gets hit for another $140.  No response again from HQ.
***Update I called back again and quickly got through with someone she found my account and told me that she would cancel the order and order a refund.  I got an email and the refund a few days later.  I have 4 bottles which is about 4 months worth. I look forward to giving it a strong 4 month go< /review>

I have has an good experience since day 1.
I started using the gel for a 3rd degree burn and by month 4 I lost 17 pounds, my burn did repair itself after 6 days of using this.
I sleep better, feel energized, and most of all my sex drive...I got my mojo back after a hystromecty in 2016.

So thankful.</Text>

There is no HGH in the product yet the ingredients listed as “inactive” are most likely the cause of the things people experience.   I’d prefer to know exactly what’s going in my bloodstream as does my doctor

<Review>I am almost into my 11 th month on the gel.  Each month gets better and better.
Being a nurse of 20 years I had no idea the benefits of replacing HGH.
I personally have experienced better sleep and energy along with calmness and mental clarity.
I had severe foot discomfort from 20 years of 12 plus hour shifts on my feet and now I don’t notice my foot at all. I love how this product heals from the inside out. I tell people all the time to be proactive with their health and not reactive....it is def much cheaper.
I will never be without my gel!!!</Review>< pictures>

<text>I've been using New U Life's  Somaderm gel for 3 months now and it has been a complete game changer for my health overall! This product works from the inside out and I noticed big differences within the first week of using this gel! One of those "too good to be true" things is what I thought but...it does NOT disappoint on any level! And now I started using their new product KetoGen and look out! Fat loss at it's best right here in powder form! This product has it ALL....and I'm seeing huge results inside of my first week already! Thank you New U Life for giving me my life back!
Happy customer and distributor!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>I’ve  been a personal trainer for 28 years and a former athlete, needless to say I’ve put my body through the ringer.  In September 2019, I’ll be 50 years old and within 3 days of using this product I knew that this was something so many people needed.  In the 28 years of being a Trainer, I’ve watched many people who have been committed to fitness and nutrition programs yet still struggled to see results in certain areas.  With my knowledge of how the systems of the body work and the understanding of the ingredients used in the formulation, it just made perfect sense.

Since using New U Life Somaderm Gel for 2.5 months I’ve experienced: Deep sleep, vivid dreams, increased libido, decreased body discomfort, increase workout recovery, better mood, more energy, and fat loss.

I’ll not only Continue to use the gel but I’ll share it with as many people as I can. I am very pleased with the results.< /Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Negative 10 review.
While I a positive person and normally do not share negative thoughts, I have to share about my experience.

I tried the product to help a friend who has started distributing the product. When I received my bottle of Somaderm, the product bottle was not full. While I believe the product says it is 3 oz, New Life deceives the customer by putting the product in a larger bottle. $164 is alot to pay for something that isnt full. It is a ripoff and I will no longer support this product, or this company. I will post reviews on every site I can find.

I did contact the company and requested more product be sent to me. They would have sent it at the same cost as I paid for the first shipment. No thank you. Never again would I deal with this company.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80856403f74a6595:0x4323f0ecf7870474</GmapID></record>

<Review>I joined this company with hopes that my dreams would come true.  I have had phenomenal results with the homeopathic gel - sleep like a rock, great energy that lasts throughout the day, hair, nails, skin look amazing, lost a little weight.  Shared SOMADERM with lots of people and THEY had great results - except for 1 person who didn't want to give it much time. Just over a week ago they came out with a Keto product and in one week I've lost almost 7 lbs.  Now I don't expect that kind of weight loss every week, let's face it - that would be crazy!  But again, the energy and the fact that I feel great using this product AND I'm losing weight - WIN WIN for me.  Oh, and did I mention that this "side-gig" of mine is definitely helping my dreams come true?  Those who are posting that this is a scam aren't telling the truth.  Or they are just dissatisfied people who want to be negative.  That's okay - there are plenty of us who love these products and this company!  This company is making history and everyone is going to know our name!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80856403f74a6595:0x4323f0ecf7870474<//gmap_id>< Response>

I attended a meeting at 421 Moderno Pl, Fullerton, CA. I was pressured into becoming a NewULife distributor to the tune of $1100. My "sponsor", Gina Kim, also known as "Forever Young" used my credit card without my authorization to pay for an Auto-ship subscription for another person. Become a distributor at your own risk.</Review>

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY #Somaderm GEL!!! It changed my life. Health is wealth and as a single Mom I cannot live without good health. Two months in: My thyroid is no longer swollen, my skin is soft and clear, my hair is softer, the pain from old injuries has lessened substantially. I have energy like I  did 15 to 20 years ago. I just started the #KetoGen4 and cannot wait to see what happens. MIND CLARITY is AMAZING!! I feel like I am myself again. Thank you #NEWULIFE!! I can never say thank you enough to Alexy.<//Text>

Great new company with stellar innovative products. Their formulator created an Hgh transdermal gel that actually delivers real hgh into the bloodstream. This has turned out to be a safe and effective way to increase your levels without the dangers and price of injectible Hgh. I have personally dropped 16 lbs over 8 months, got an eye lift from a drooping eyelid, weaned off my antidepressant and continually get up in the morning WAY easier than I ever did - the solid sleep is amazing. My mother who is also using suffered woth kidney stones for 40 years and her one kidney had cellular necrosis. Her sonogram last month after using fir 7 months showed a completely healed kidney. You cant fake that and the doctor admitted he worked to treat the stones but could not take any credit for something so amazing as that. I will change to 5 stars once they get Customer service on track.  This company has grown exponentially and exceeded any volume that could have been predicted so I know its not an overnight task. I will never give up on this product because of what it's doing on the inside of my body. I know I will live a better, healthier life with this amazing gel.<//text>

<pics>None</pics><text>Used the Gel for 7 weeks.  Absolutely nothing.  Just another MLM pyramid scheme.  They delete your honest review or testimonial off FaceBook and anywhere else to cover the truth of your own experience if it doesn't help sales.  Walk away.  Eat right, exercise & drink water - you'll thank me.  Thankful I didn't sign up for "autoship"!!  Or I'd be stuck giving them money every month!  They never reply to e-mails or answer phone calls AND keep asking you to give them your credit card or bank routing information over and over again - even after you've ordered.  NO WAY.  Ask them for proof of their "clinical trials" - uh huh.... Crickets.<//text>< Name>

<review>somaderm gives a false sense it’s working, until it’s not. Reported negative health issues and side effects are on the rise concerning somaderm Gel. Buyer beware, you get way more than you bargain for (or want) with this stuff!< /review>< pictures>

Company so far has ran out of product and still hasn’t shipped me a bottle that was paid for about a month ago.  They are about to deduct for another bottle as per my auto renewal.  How can a company take money from well over 5000 distributors and countless paying customers and not have the decency to even send an email with an explanation or an approximation as to when already paid for packages will be shipped.  I’m beginning to believe this company is fraudulent.  They continually give one reason, then another as to why product hasn’t shipped and to be ready for deliveries within a week, only to spin another take the following week.  It’s insane they can convince people to peddle their product full force while not even having a real expected delivery date.  When you call with a complaint they do not even see it necessary to return call or emails.  When someone answers their phone they will give the lame excuse that they just moved offices and their is no one to transfer your call to and to leave a message that will never get answered.  How is this legal and how can they get away with it?
There are other products that are cheaper and will yield better results, such as GHRP 2   They will sing about how their product is FDA approved.  It’s a white lie.  The transdermal gel application is FDA approved.  If you look at any of their advertisements you will see that it says in the fine print that “these statements have NOT been evaluated by the FDA.” That is the asterisk that follows each the the claimed benefits the state.  And I am a distributor.  My distributor number is 102169.  I want a full refund and to be done with this scamming and fraudulent company.  DO NOT get caught up with them. You will lose your money.  .< /Text>

<review>There are those of us who understand "some things are worth waiting for" and look further to understand WHY the product is delayed.  Then there are those who jump to conclusions and spew negativity because they are immature and unwilling or unable to be patient and listen to find out WHY.  If someone joined the company as a distributor and is whining about what's going on without looking at the big picture, that shows a complete lack of maturity with regards to business.  I have been on this product for over 3 months and LOVE my results.  This is definitely NOT a scam and the numerous testimonies from the people who have been using the product will attest to that.  We are THE ONLY transdermal HgH gel on the market, registered with the FDA and having an NDC# (national drug code#).  Safe, effective and those who have it - LOVE IT!</review>< Date>

This company double charged all their customers for a month and will not refund the double change.   Customer service hardly answers the phone or emails.   When you do get someone they tell you they will refund you but they never do.  This company is going down a bad road.  Also I used the product for 5 months and nothing.</text>

Have been buying little replacement parts from this shop for years.  Great local business that always has just the right part at just the right time.  Owner Fred is a wealth of knowledge about all things appliance related.  I have long recommended this place for advice and replacement parts, and I have made sent numerous family and friends to Miracle Appliance.

Today I had a very odd experience with the owner however.  Long story short, I ended up purchasing a $170 ice maker part that ended up not solving my issue.  I explained that after swapping this part into my fridge, the errors persisted and I called a repair company to diagnose and fix. A different fix was required, so the ice maker that I purchased was not needed.

Though there are signs clearly posted in the business and on the receipts stating all sales are final/no returns, I figured that I'd at least ask if something could be done.  When I came into the store, Fred immediately started the return process , took my card and provided a receipt without me actually asking to do a return.  Great so far, but when he returned from the credit card machine, he chastised me about using him as a spare parts depot to diagnose my problem at his expense.  He asked for my receipt, which I had left at home, and when I told him as much, he said I didn't bring it because it has the no returns/refunds language displayed.  His typically jovial demeanor changed on a dime and he basically said that he couldn't take a chance selling me any parts in the future because he couldn't risk me trying to return them.  When I tried to engage him in a discussion to indicate that if he didn't want to take the return, and and I'd be OK with that, he asked me to leave the store so he could help the next customers in line.

To Fred, the owner:  this is crazy!  Here are some things you could have done to handle the situation better:

1) Just say no to returns -- You clearly indicate all sales are final, and that's fine, no dispute here.  Totally acceptable policy, but if you decide to bend your policy for a given customer, no need for the accusatory argument about being used as a test parts depot.  Your comment about me being old enough to know that asking for a return was rude, as was your comment about $170 being significant to you but implying it was not significant to me.

2) Restocking fees may apply -- Though the part I initially purchased was in a box, and had no documentation, plastic wrapping etc. and could easily have been an open-box/returned part, I assumed it was new from the factory.  You mentioned that you could no longer sell this part as new, and I get that, but how about you ask for a reasonable restocking fee that allows you resell the part as used without taking a gross margin hit?  Take 15 minutes, do a continuity check and get the part back on the shelf. Seems like common sense.

3) You're cut off -- I felt like I was in that Seinfeld episode with the restaurateur that sells soup, you know the one.  Basically telling me to leave your store and that you wouldn't sell me any other parts because I might try to return them is outrageous.  Having a conversation rather than dismissing me from your store would have gone a long way, and would likely have resulted in me continuing to make purchases from your business and continuing to make recommendations to my network.

I know how hard you work in your store, and your sage advice has saved me countless thousands of dollars in repair costs in the past, but this type of interaction is really unacceptable.  In COVID times I've tried to spend my money with local businesses rather than the online retailers, but banning me from your store means more business for Amazon.  Would love to continue the discussion if you care to discuss.</Text>

It was more expensive than buying online, but I needed the part so it could be installed right away. I went over there to buy the part, the owner took one look at the failed part and told me how to fix it, although he would have been happy to sell me the new part. So they're honest too.

<Review>Absolutely best place for advice and parts for you appliances!  He has an encyclopedic knowledge of potential issues, how to troubleshoot problems, and he even tested my part to determine its serviceability.  We’re talking old school customer service with an extraordinarily knowledgeable individual who has virtually any part you can imagine In Stock!  In addition, he carries the “Good Stuff” meaning factory parts that will last, not cheap generic knock-offs that you’ll be frequently replacing. Miracle Appliance has my business and I strongly recommend you make Miracle your first stop for information and parts.</Review><user_name>Daniel Milla</user_name>< Response>

Where do I even begin?
I've heard stories about this little hole in the wall store that's packed wall to wall floor to ceiling with parts in no obvious order.  Barely enough room to slide sideways down the aisles and this genius of a man who always knows what part you need and where its at.
Both my kids are down with the flu, doing non stop loads of laundry (clothes, towels, and bedding) to try and keep my wife and I from getting it and prevent relapse of the kids.  The dryer stops drying.
My first instinct is look it up online.  I do a search for my model and symptom.  Everything I read says replace the thermostat, I get the part number and call the only place I know of that should have the part.
Fred answers the phone and ever so kindly asks me to hold please.  (Not a real "hold", he just set the phone down and finished helping the customer in front of him while I listened on the phone.)
He came back to me and asked how he could help.  I asked him if he had the part i needed, told him the model number of my dryer and the part number i was needing.
Fred's response "Why do you think you need that part?", "What is the issue you are having?".
I explain and he says "You don't need that part", "Why don't you remove parts x,y, & z and bring them in to me and I'll test them."
"and you better hurry, i close at 1pm".  It was about 11:45 so I quickly tore the machine apart and removed every part in the area of the thermostat that I could easily remove (because I couldn't remember the specific parts he told me).
I rushed over to the store and found exactly what I've heard about it.
I waited for Fred to finish with the customer ahead of me and then it was my turn.
He greeted me so incredably kindly and I laid all my parts on the counter.  I told him I had just called about the Dryer and I hoped these were all the parts he told me to bring.  He confirmed I brought everything.  He took out a voltmeter and proceeded to explain to me what value each should show as he tested and showed me each one.  There was one part that was slightly off, the rest read the correct readings.
He walked back to a shelf and came back with a small bag with two parts in it.
He took them out and put a little red marker mark on each.
He handed me the bag and said "This is your problem, take these and put them in and if it works you owe me $30".
I tried to argue "How about I give you the $30 and if it doesn't work I'll come back." I told him that I couldn't be back before 1pm when he closed.  Fred would not have it and told me come back after the weekend then scooted me out the door.
I went home installed the parts, put it all back together and low and behold it worked!
I will be returning tomorrow (Monday) to pay Fred the $30 I owe him and thank him profusely.
I told my wife the story of the nicest, kindest, most customer oriented man I've ever met in my life and I HAD to write this review.
Fred is AMAZING, One of a Kind!< /Review>

The owner here has the best customer service. I think he has a PhD in appliance repair.  I told him the symptoms my dryer was having and he correctly diagnosed the issue and have me the correct part. It was very easy to install with his instructions.  I will definitely be back for any appliance issues.<//Text>

I went to miracle appliance for the first time today as it came highly recommended.  I had a bum ice maker in the freezer that I needed fixed.  Fred was quick, friendly, and professional.  He replaced the motor and a few other parts, all the while explaining everything.  I was very impressed with the level of service - something hard to come by nowadays.

I am now a customer for life and you should be too!</Text>

Excellent service. I had an issue with my washing machine and after looking at 100 youtube videos and trying to figure it out I called miracle appliance parts and he talked me through the whole thing and even had the part in stock. I called him to thank him for helping me out. I will be coming here for all my appliance needs and will be referring everyone to him!< /text>

You may find the items online for a bit cheaper, but it might be aftermarket and may not last. That along with Fred's knowledge and kindness makes Miracle the only place I go.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Far more than expected ! Saturday fixing our home Bosch dishwasher and tested out to a defective control board. Took a chance and rang Miracle on a whim they might have which they did ! And cheaper than on line.

Fred empathized as he only had 2 control boards that were refurbs but insisted we take “both” in case one didn’t work.
He wouldn’t take any payment until we ran the machine (if it fixed it) for a few days.....then just let him know and settle up.

This kind of store, owner and basic trust in people is long lost and a pleasure know he’s local in Thousand Oaks. Looks like he has a ton of parts and knowledge to go with it.

The owner is amazing.  I came in to buy a replacement air filter due to the fires we just had in the area and was about to spend $60 on the filter.  I told him when it had been replaced and he said I didn't need to buy it.  He described how to clean it and said to save my money.  He turned down a sale because he said I didn't need it!   Not sure that had ever happened to me before.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Fred is an amazing guy.  If there was such a thing as an appliance parts store 200 years ago, this is the way it would have been run.  Your are greeted with a friendly hello and a smile.  You are most likely going to walk out with the exact part you need and verbal instructions on how to install it AND how to troubleshoot the part you want to replace, just to be sure that is where the problem is.  Fred will spend as much time as needed with you to ensure you know how to double check your work and will share insider tricks on how to do your part replacement.  If you aren't sure of your problem, Fred will likely loan you one of his spare parts (that he likely repaired himself) to try out at no charge of any kind.  I know because he has loaned me parts.  He has even loaned me specialized tools made for specific parts.  Fred is kind and trusting and on top of that, he really knows his appliances...... and other interesting things too!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>You can not get better service than this. My washing machine had problems and the person in the store, I believe he is the owner, listened to the issue and then lent me a tool that I could use to fix the problem, instead of trying to sell me a part I do not need. He simply asked me to return the tool when I was done. I will definitely come back to this store for any of my appliance needs. Great job; this is the kind of small business that really shows how great customer service is done.< /text><user_name>johannes bloem< /user_name>< Time>

I’ve been a customer of Miracle Appliance for over ten years. Fred, the owner and operator, is an amazing man. Not only he is very knowledgeable about all sorts of appliances he is also a very dignified businessman.  Fred is not in a hurry to make a buck out of you and send you away. When it is your turn, he gives you his undivided attention. His parts prices are incredibly fairly priced, but the support that he happily gives is priceless. He is a rare gem in our Conejo Valley community. Thank you Fred.</text>

This gent knows his appliance parts!  His shop is old school, meaning all of the knowledge is in his head, and not on the computer.  I brought is a gas dryer ignitor and he knew the model number off his head, went to the back and pulled out a replacement (without looking up inventory or using a computer).  As I was examining the part, at least two other patrons walked in and he was able to provide the needed parts for them in the same efficiency as he did for me.  One gent was wearing the repair uniform of a major appliance manufacturer, who obviously is an old friend and long-time customer of his.  Thanks to Miracle, the avocado green dryer I bought used in 1990 is up and running, for the low cost of $30.  Plus he's a real nice man, the kind you'd want to have coffee with.<//text>

Absolutely the best customer service you could hope for from any business. Just read the other reviews. We went there to fix our new GE stove that arrived missing parts on the lower oven drawer. Then our Whirlpool dryer that needed a new gas valve solenoid. Now we're back for a GE refrigerator broken ice maker bracket. Fred knows all the parts, the repairs, and he is a great person. Excellent inventory on hand. Reasonable prices. Miracle Appliance Parts is THE BEST business of its kind. The best business of many kinds.</text>

The gentleman that operates this business is an absolute gem! He has all the knowledge, is very courteous, efficient, patient, and asks the right questions to get to the heart of your appliance issue. A generous and kind man. They don't make people like this any more. Can't say enough good things about this man!!! A real treasure.</Review>

<Text>Over the years I’ve purchased several parts from here.  Every time I felt that I was taken care of.  This last experience confirmed the reason why this is the only place I will get appliance parts, including Amazon.  I called and told him what I wanted to purchase, he quickly told me a price and when I could expect it, but before I placed the order he said, “check this before I order to make sure”.  It turns out it wasn’t the part I needed to replace.  He saved me the cost and time and he lost a sale, (this time) because it turned out all I need to do was a cleaning of the other part, which fixed the problem.  He seems to know everything about everything, at least what I’ve called him about.  By the way, the part I needed from him was an extra $10, based on what I could find elsewhere online.  He ended up saving me so much more.  I won’t go anywhere else, ever.<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

Fred is wonderful!  Helpful, polite, and knowledgeable.  He took 10 minutes to walk me through disassembling my Samsung Dryer and checking the drum rollers.  His prices are reasonable and he has or can get ANYTHING.   Kudos!< /text>

So story....Today’s mission: find the part to fix the washing machine so John can fix the washing machine ( I married a tool ) and while on my mission I ran into Yoda, quite the storyteller, seriously I couldn’t have been there more than ten minutes and what we covered: Iran and the Revolution, Jeff Bezos, his wife, the mistress, the genitalia, Val Kilmer, Real Genius, a few quotes, this country but he had the best and last story.

A what sounds to be a young man calls and asks if he has a timer for his broken dryer to which Yoda says he does indeed at the cost of $160 so young man asks Yoda to hold it for him, he’ll be right down to purchase. Yoda being the fine fellow he truly is tells the young man that a broken belt is the more likely culprit, and if he does this certain thing they can find out for sure, whatdayaknow, broken belt that will be $17 and I whatdayaknow Yoda has one in stock. So young man comes to the store to purchase a $17 belt, and meanwhile realizes that the same belt is sold on Amazon for $11 so explains to Yoda he really wants to buy the $11 Amazon belt but he also wants to do his dryer fixing today after all he has an infant at home, so Yoda please match the price to which Yoda explained that no he wouldn’t be able to stay in business if he matched the price, and so the young man (business giant) told him he changed his mind, which was fine with Yoda. 30 seconds later the young man upon further deliberation I’m assuming, decided he now wants to purchase that $17 belt, to which my new most favorite person on planet replied, “oh I’m sorry, I too, changed my mind I’m saving that part for a good customer” to which he was told by young man that he was a good customer or I guess he was thinking he was going to be, because after being told no, he said to Yoda that he’d been lost forever as a customer. So Yoda, being Yoda asked the young man what he did for living, he replied he was a math teacher, so Yoda replied mathematically and told the young man he actually made $10 in him today. As far as a customer is concerned he didn’t have him yesterday nor tomorrow and zero from zero is zero, but in between, to go to a movie would cost $10, he was great entertainment, actually you can’t make this stuff up.

You can't beat Fred! He exemplifies what customer service used to be, and still should be. Other business owners should take notes. I gave him a call about my washer. Not only did he give me several options to troubleshoot to ensure if we ordered a part, we would get it right the first time, he even loaned a part! Well that part fixed and his price was equal to any I found online.

If you have any questions regarding appliances, don't purchase parts or replacements without consulting Fred first. He is A+< /review>

Fred is amazing.  I have dealt with him on two issues. Both times he made sure that I wasn't buying something I really didn't need.  He fixed my first issue himself which resulted in my not having to buy a costly part.  This was a loss for him and a savings for me. This man cares about people first, he has my business for life.  I tell everyone about this place.  He is very honest.<//review>

<text>Miracle Appliance is probably the best customer experience I've had in many many years. Fred knows his stuff, always explains how to replace items, WHY you should replace items and even asks you to call him afterwards to let him know that the repair was successful. I went in for a part for my AC unit. He offered me a replacement part but then found a better one that was $8 cheaper!  Now that's how you keep customers.

If only every other business treated its customers the way Miracle Appliance does.<//text><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>My clothes washer was overflowing onto the garage floor. An internet search revealed my solution was either a $15.00 part or a $51.00 part. Fred at Miracle Appliance told me what to do and saved me all of that. I didn't need to buy anything and the fix took all of five minutes. Fred is an appliance GENIUS. Thanks Fred, all of your solutions have been the right solution. You're batting 1000 in my book.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1443808765411< /Date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I thought I'd give the local parts shop my business so I called this guy up looking for a small shaft seal for a Whirpool Dishwasher.
He tells me the part is discontinued, but he'd sell me one for $50.
I let him know they are for sale all over the internet for $15-20.
He was rude and said why don't I just go and buy it there.
He just lost a customer... Bad attitude and a rip off.<//Review>

That said, Google the part you need before you buy from him. Just bought a plastic handle from him for a washing machine. The price on the bag said $34.99 and he sold it to me for $30, I guess his accountant figures out his sales Tax? Got home and thought the price was a bit high and Google it, one of the 1st sights that came up was Amazon, They had same part for $5 plus shipping . Two others at $7.50, one at $11.32. EBay had 27 results the lowest was $1.95 plus $2.85 for shipping. Same part! The highest was $999.99 free shipping maybe this his EBay store? All said, goodbye Fred, You should not Rip off your American friends.< /Review>< time>

< Review>
Fred is awesome!!
I am trying to repair my 8 yr old fridge that just stopped cooling.

I searched online and it said to replace part x.  Took it into Fred and he told me before checking it that is wasn't the problem.  He checked the part and sure enough he was right.

I replaced the motherboard tonight (at Freds recommendation) and sure enough the fridge is working again just fine.  I had the option of using a new motherboard for about $160 or a used board for about a third of the price.

I'm looking forward to having this fridge for another 8 - 10 years and am confident if there are any issues with the fridge that Fred will have any parts I need.

Fred reminds me of my grandfather, and makes me want to continue in his footsteps and repair what I can rather than replacing fixable items.</Review>

My boyfriend and I found ourselves driving around on a Sunday looking for a replacement part for our washing machine motor. Home Depot was not only not nice but they have NO replacements parts for this type of machine. We then ended up in Thousand Oaks at Miracle Appliance and although he was also closed he just so happened to have stopped by his shop for a part he needed. He saw us outside and opened for his. We showed him the part we needed, he found it in less than 2 minutes, sold it to us for an EXTREMELY fair price, then took the time to look at the motor we had brought with us and give my boyfriend some tips on how to replace the part. Ironically enough, it felt like a miracle indeed. Please, if ever in need of a part for your appliance, go to this place first. This man is so nice and so helpful it really makes me feel good to know that businesses like his still exist.</Review>

I called on a Sunday (over Memorial Day Weekend).  The owner said he was closed, but would still be at the shop for about an hour.  He had the part and offered to stay until I got there.  Not many owners would do that for a $24 part.  I drove to the shop, picked up the part, and the owner double-checked to the part I brought in to make sure it was bad.  He even gave me a few tips to make the installation easier for me.< /review>

My washer wouldn't run when I closed the door, the owner told me over the phone it was one of two problems and there was no way of checking which one without replacing each one.  He gave me his suggestion and told me how to fix it and he was right.  Just tonight the belt on my dryer broke so I will be heading over to miracle appliance tomorrow morning.< /Review>

Fred is the go to guy for all Appliance questions in Thousand Oaks.  Go to Home Depot, ask a sales person an appliance question, and 9 times out of 10 they'll say, "I don't know... but there's this guy...  Fred...at Miracle Appliance.  Here's his card.  Give him a call, he'll know.

I've called him twice and he solved my problem over the phone, not needing to sell me anything.

If you've got a question or a problem, start here.<//text>

If all business owners were like Fred the world would be a better place.  Fred is phenominal and I've never met anyone that know's his business as well as Fred does.  If it's broke ALWAYS go to Fred first.

My latest repair was a broken dryer timer.  A new one costs $120.  Fred finds a used one in the back of his shop and tells me to try it.  If it works then I owe him $50.  If it doesn't bring it back and we'll try something else.  He wouldn't let me pay him while I was standing there in the shop.  Of course it worked and the dryer works great now.

I've seen Sears repair guys in the shop with Fred showing them how to fix things.  You can't go wrong by starting with Fred.</Review>

<text>Accidentally found this place. Simply put, YOU CAN NOT DO ANY BETTER.
Fred is the owner and an incredible role model for ALL people. I've been in his shop waiting as he helps a confused little 'ol lady, while waiting an appliance repair man for a major appliance came in and was also waiting his turn. He told me that Fred knows more than his company tect people do about their own parts. He doesn't just sell you a part ... he educates you. Incidentally it's impossible to buy a new replacement part if he can fix the old one for you. He did that for my ice maker and he refuses to take any money for that. He somehow come up with replacement parts for ANY appliance, no matter how old the unit.<//text></record>

Fred rocks, he is on a first name basis with every part in his store. Freakish weird how he can be on the phone answering questions with two different people AND three people in his store at the same time. He gets my vote for mayor of Thousand Oaks.

If you go into the store and there is a line, just wait around, you'll learn something new about some appliance you thought could never be repaired.</Review>

So my D Washer sounded like it was going to blow - loud seem to be motor noise, may need a new one?? Called Fred, explained the problem and mimicked the noise over the phone. Fred said "there is something stuck in the impeller". No Way - told me how to take it apart and sure enough, the fly in the ointment was a plastic toothpick in the impeller. Fixed - Fred is the Miracle if he can make me look this smart : )< /text>

<text>In 20 -years of living in TO, they have the parts that have 'saved' my appliances (meaning I got more years from my appliance instead of having to buy a new one) many times with parts that I didn't think I could ever get (and sometimes they have been discontinued parts but Fred has them!). I don't need them but every 4-6 years, but when I do they come through!</text><pics>None<//pics><username>Bridgeman Carney< /username><time>1411160124060</time>< rating>

I had the chance to meet Fred yesterday, I had an issue with the freezer not getting cold and tried to diagnose it myself willing to spend up to $280 on 2 parts evap fan ($80) and a motherboard($200). New fridge would have cost me $1600. I called in earlier in the day about parts and availability and our conversation was very short. Got off work at 5pm drove home, removed the fan and board in 15min it was 5:35pm and I called and he picked up I told him that I need 2 parts he said come on down, i'll be here. The moment I came in I saw Fred and introduced myself and it was 5:45pm (he closes at 5:30pm) I told him of my problem and he already had the parts in-front of him and began dissecting my old fan and removed the thermostat sensor and began plugging it into the new fan. Being a do-it-yourself kind of guy I figured he just saved me $30 because the evap fan with thermostat was $110 (search from earlier in the day). We began to talk and he saw my motherboard and I told him I needed to get this too since most of the boards online mention to replace this as-well since the fan went out. Anyhow Fred inspects and tells me this board is in good shape and show'd me the resistor and etc that usually go bad. Then he tells me  I didn't need to buy the board  and spend $200 and said"are you sure" and he says "trust me why spend the money." After almost 45min of talking he tells me his cost on the evap fan and why he didn't sell me the evap fan w/thermostat for $110 and he tells me why it's because your a do-it-yourselfer and he wanted to teach me something. The whole time I thought it's because he didn't have the part but he proved me wrong he did and he showed it to me. I can read people very well and this owner at the end of the day is a straight up old-schooler he's smart and likes to help people, he's honest, he wants to up-hold his great reputation, which I read most of his reviews prior to my visit.  Fred could have taken advantage of may situation for financial gain but didn't. I normally would save a buck and buy online for parts but after meeting Fred the knowledge and knowing the type of person and level he is, I can say he is very trust-worthy. This is my first review ever! I will always support Miracle Appliance in Thousand Oaks. Fred's an asset to the community. People don't fix appliances like they used to, people no-a-days would throw out a fridge for a $60 part. I came very close and im glad I didn't. It gave me an opportunity to met Fred........ P.S. last night I was thinking what else could be broken so I could go back to Fred. crazy huh, he really made an impression on me. 5-stars!!!< /Review>

Absolutely no customer service...the reason is they hire illegals from Mexico and they have no communication or customer service skills...lady offered me insurance and wanted me to leave my credit card on file so she can charge the remaining balance two weeks later ....come to find out through my bank statement that they charged a late fee and also charged higher then what was agreed upon making the first payment after the lady mentioned two weeks prior that she would charge my card two weeks after the first payment ( reason for leaving my card on file) ...no thank you I cancelled my policy and went else where , never got scammed like this and would never deal with this company unless your looking for a stressful time<//text>

Really bad customer service. The staff are rude and if you complain about a problem, they are condescending and careless. The insurance company my husband was paying through their brokerage, was closed down in California for fraud. Look it up. They work with fraudulent insurers. When my husband confronted them through the phone they hung up on him. When he went personally, they couldnt give him a straight answer. Do not take your business. Cheap may sometimes turn out expensive.</review>

(Translated by Google) I went to open an insurance here. I asked the lady that I was about to sell my car and that if I changed my car I was going to pay for the change and she said no. Then I called a different office because I did not find their offices online, I call and I explain to the person that I want to change cars because I sold the insured car, she tells me that I have to pay 80 for a change of car and the assurance sent me to 137, and I told him that they told me where I opened my insurance that they would not charge me anything for a change of car, well I call the office where I opened my insurance and this lady is charging me more 100 for a change of car and 149 month, I explained the same and he tells me I will call you back that my notes have not dropped, and of course I do not want to turn off 100 or 80 so when they told me that you did not even pay anything for a change of car, At last I arrive at the office, the lady tells me to talk to my manager and 50 you can pay for a change of car plus 12 because the insurance will go up, and I tell her but at that moment she did not know if my insurance was going to go up or not, then I notice that my insurance only went up $ 3. then the lady has to reimburse me for the rest of my money, call her and now she says she doesn't know why I call her. francis pesimo service, they are not onestos I do not want to go back there again. Read the customer comments first if you want to go,

<text>(Translated by Google) I do not usually write a comment but, I think it is necessary to say that this agency is a scam, they gave me an estimate for 2 vehicles and a down payment of around $ 200 according to financing me 6 months, as if they were giving me a credit, they are ridiculous and clear Many innocent people are swindled out of their money with this kind of pointless argument.

Please be careful !!

No acostumbro a escribir comentario pero, creo es necesario decir que esta agencia es una estafa me dieron un estimado por 2 vehiculos y un enganche de alrededor de $200 segun por financiarme 6 meses, como si me estuvieran dando un credito, son unos ridiculos y claro a mucha gente inocente la estafan sacandole su dinero con este tipo de argumentos sin sentido.

Overall, good. However, not enough care was given to spacing between tables inside or outside. Think COVID spacing. Appetizer and dessert was above average. The steak should have been cooked with a tad more salt to bring out the flavor, but otherwise was good.</review>

The food and service was really good. Outdoor dining was warm even on a cold night.  Looked at menus online before I went and had in mind what I wanted. Come to find out they changed their concept because of covid, so I was a little disappointed about that. Overall, nice place.< /Review>

<Text>We had an amazing family lunch today.  The service was very attentive.  Our food came out hot and delicious.  My burger had the perfect amount of melted cheese oozing off the patty :)

The dessert choices were hard to choose from so we ordered them all.  Look forward to checking out their Vegas location soon.< /Text>< pics>

Decent atmosphere here. Outside seating is noisy due to cars on Hwy 9. Food is good, not great. Best item I had was the fries so I guess thats not saying much. Its a good place to relax and chat with friends,  but if you want a nice meal I'd go somewhere else in my opinion. Doesn't mean I won't re-visit this place.< /review>

I was planning on meeting a date but he was very delayed. Despite the staff being busy, they did a great job at checking in with me and even making conversation.

The food was ok. The old fashioned was perfect.<//Review>

Came at lunch time on a Sunday during COVID-19 era. Plenty of space outside to dine, lots of variety of options to eat and drink. Skewers were delicious, steak was cooked well-done and juicy, chicken had the right amount of spices, shrimp was great. Sliders were amazing, right balance of spices, sauces, tenderness. Highly recommend any of those items and the season fries were also amazing. Staff was courteous. Ambiance was great.</Text>

Spectacuar. Maybe after 10PM that huge wine rack transforms into an octagon, 2 for 1 wells and FIGHTS pub open till two? Don't go cheap on the waiver writer. Good stuff< /Review>

Visiting from out of town and stumbled upon Flight Restaurant. Pleasantly surprised with this American style tapas. Enjoyed the flight of fries and flight of sliders. Tuna was delicious. Salads were refreshing.  Classy environment with an airline themed team approach. Service was friendly and food arrived quickly.  Recommend checking this place out.<//Text>

<review>It was our first time to be there. It's fun place and flights portions are bigger than we thought. Food was good overall. We ordered Tropical cocktail (they are not cheap on alcohol), Salads, Ahi Tuna, and Boneless Fried Chicken. We wanted to order dessert but we became full. Luckily, we went there early with a reservation at 5:30pm before a concert so everything was smooth and be able to get out quickly. Definitely go back there!</review>< rate>

<review>Great concept! Loved the atmosphere. Probably better with a larger group. Got to try the different dishes. Two cocktail flights for two people too much if you're light weight or out of practice. Service was better than an actual flight and plenty of leg space. Room for carry on luggage is not an issue, but room for drinks and plates is a problem at the 2-tops.<//review>< Name>

I had brussels sprouts and salmon - the brussels were bland, slightly undercooked and underseasoned. The salmon was overcooked and dry, and the small amounts of mashed potatoes were a little burnt and also dry. I wanted to get the IPA beer flight, but they were out of one of the beers (and the selection was meagre to begin with). We dined indoor for the first time in months, but at Flights it was so cold inside that the whole point of indoor dining was gone – I'm pretty sure the guests on the patio were more comfortable. Thankfully the staff was really great, attentive and friendly, partially saving the visit but I probably won't come back here.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1617676964905, 'text': 'Hi Alexander, thanks for coming in to see us.

Great food and service. All dishes come in three different kinds.
Also I've liked the design of the place - all connected to flights.<//text>

Such a fun way to have dinner. Everything comes in "flights" of three, that is three variations of the same dish. The service is friendly and the call buttons are a great idea, service comes quickly when needed. Highly recommended!</review>

<text>Located at the start of downtown Los Gatos, great atmosphere and staff. Went for brunch on a Sunday mid morning.Food was delicious for what we had. Ceviche, Bacon cheeseburger, waffles and crepes. All with really good flavors and spices. Bring able to have a really good "flight" of flavors. Everything crossed over very well! Definitely looking forward to going back soon.< /text><gmapID>0x808e35ee4b03a399:0x3ded25c54efac275< /gmapID><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP5RFMk6JvYMdXFf0LR25r2_XrSm1ujXEZ_zwL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI6pVc5vdytE-uR9rcl8jEqt0y3N6qkFGU2cuJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Date>

Great place to hangout with friends. Love the outdoor seating area. Both food and drinks are served in flights which I love because I like small bites so I can try more options in one settings. The tuna was great, highly recommend!<//Review>

I like the idea of this place. Having a bunch of sampler plates, but when you get 3 bites and they room 10 to 18 a plate you might as well go to a place that servers full size lunch entries.  We got 4 dishes.  I have to say the 2 pricier dishes we just below average and the ones we liked were the fries (single order) and the street corn tortillas.  I think for ceviche they completely failed and the tiny tortilla chips where greasy and had a taste of old oil to it.  The Stix smaller it chicken in that peanut sauce, beef in chimicurri sauce and shrimp wasn't worth the price. All of it was leaving in some way with the seasoning.</review>

It was my first time here. First off the customer service was good, everyone was so friendly... server Jesse was so helpful. The only reason I'm giving them a 3 star is because the Mary's Chicken wasn't cooked well. I saw redness inside the meat and the amount of greek yogurt was so little spread over the chicken it barley reached my tongue for the price it was. It normally should cover all pieces not just 1 per my experienceat other restaurants.. Also they didn't provide straws especially during covid precautions. I had to ask for straw. First thing in their menu talks about covid precautions, but yet they didn't provide straw until I asked.  Will I return? Maybe yes to try other dishes that are non red meat or maybe not..</Text>

Very friendly and affordable but delicious restaurant. They feature the plates called "flights" that have 3 different flavors in one plate. It's really nice to share in your party little  by little. Enough seats and parking spaces.</Review>

Not great. We were seated for our 8pm reservation and were not helped until I flagged somebody down. This was at 8:25. After a nice apology our order was taken. At 8:35 another server came out and said the first server was very busy and asked if he could take our order again. Despite our frustration (and hunger!) we repeated our order. After five minutes the server came back out and told us one of the items we ordered was out. That was the final straw. We cancelled our order. As we walked out we saw another group that arrived after us served with food and drinks. Very disappointing!< /review>

This was my first visit to a Flights restaurant and I thought the concept was really fun. Everything they serve is a "flight" with multiple variations of the same dish or drink - perfect for the person who has trouble deciding what they want. For example, the flight of mac n' cheese came with three mini skillets of different types of mac n' cheese to try. The "flight attendants" (aka servers) thing was kind of corny, but I loved that there was a button that let you call if you needed something. I wasn't blown away by the food overall but they get points for the concept.<//text>

Food and service are all excellent here. Prices are reasonable too. You can choose standard tables or the lounge.
Food and beer is delivered in 3s, which is the theme here. I suggest you do a family style and share you various 3-combos. We tend to mix the various appetizers and entrees together and let food come as it is ready. The flavors are really good and often very different from other restaurants. The 3 smallish items per serving means you get to experiment with things you might not have tried. This is now our favorite family restaurant for everything above and the excellent wait/bar staff.
This is so interesting to eat at I strongly urge you to try it< /Review>

I was excited to try this place! The idea of combining tapas/flights seemed perfect for a happy hour with a friend. Plus during actual happy hour it's 25% off the menu!

VIBE: located in beautiful downtown Campbell! Decent sized place with a bar and good amount of tables

SERVICE: how cute that all the waiters are like "flight attendants"! They also give you a card to flip up at the table when you need service or when you're "ready for take off". Kinda cheesy but convenient!

FOOD: if you check in on Yelp you get a free glass of champagne!

Tropical cocktails- pina colada, strawberry daiquiri and mai tai. Don't let their tiny size fool you, these were STRONG.

French fries- truffle, garlic and sweet potato each with their own dipping sauces. My favorite dip was with the sweet potato!

Mac n Cheese- classic, truffle, and bacon/jalapeño. Surprisingly I preferred the bacon over the truffle which wasn't that flavorful.

BBQ Sliders- These were difficult to share since we had to cut these tiny messy sliders in half. But I thought they paired well with the other flights

Overall our happy hour was enjoyable, and our server didn't try to rush us to finish even though the restaurant was getting pretty crowded as it got closer to peak dinner time. I think its only worth it to come here for happy hour because for a couple of flights it added to be pretty pricy (~$60 after tip) and I didn't think the food was that unique, just insta-worthy presentation.< /Review>

Really yummy food. Good drinks, frozen margaritas were especially good.
Got pizza flights, empanadas and bbq sliders.
Thanks to Doug and Claire for exceptional reception and helping us with our menu choices.< /review>

The idea of small flights of dishes may be innovative, but the execution is sub par. The venue is tacky, dishes are very uninspired, and frankly I can think of a dozen restaurants in walking distance that I'd rather visit.</Text>

Has a great time at Flights.  Cute aviation uniforms and vernacular, family style comfort food.  Here all the dishes and drinks come by default in flights of three variations.  Staff was super helpful and nice. The portions were not skimpy and the food was good.  Drinks good too, but given the local bounty, I do think there was room for improvement there.  I would suggest having a first class upgrade option on the drinks.  Should be easy to pull off and I would have certainly used it.  They have their own little parking lot out back with a couple Tesla chargers.  Overall we loved Flights and we will be back.<//review>

<review>The small plate flights are a fun way to try a lot of different flavors without breaking the bank or overeating. We shared the fries, stix, chicken, and tacos. The beef taco was fabulous, and so were the truffle oil fries and herbed fries. Our server, Matt, was really nice and explained the family-style serving of food.</review>< Rate>

So we went to this place on a Friday night. We had a large group but none of us could drink because either we were driving or we simply didn't drink alcohol. First off the service was horrible.  I buzzed the waiter a dozen times and never got service. We were told to use the buzzer. We complained 3 or 4 times.  We finally got service after nearly 30 minutes. The place was about 80% full and they were clearly focused on customers who order drinks. We were 3rd class citizens.  We had kids in our  party and the kids menu was a joke. Their corn was spicy, full of cilantro. Falafel was spicy. The kids juice Never ever came. The kids pizza was nice and large though. Now the food was pretty tasty, good but really nothing spectacular. It ends up being a bit on the expensive side with the tapas like menu.
Somehow our wait person never took to us so based on that avoid this place.</Text>

Great food. But the service was absolutely horrible. Friendly. But just lacked the basics -- took too long to come by and take order,  didn't clear plates after different servings. Table was a mess. Dessert came. Didn't clear. I had to move plates from my table to one next door. Server saw.  Didn't care. I should get the tips. Disappointing. A shame since the food was really good. Great satays.  Hummus was a hit. And good variety on drinks. But service-wise, needs to pick up.</text>

Oh it's the Best Place ever!  We had the best French fries, I've ever tasted. They had 3 flavor's of fries with 3 flavor's of dip's. They just melted in your mouth. The Beef Sliders, oh wow yum. The atmosphere was great using airplane wing's for table's. The Owner was Friendly and helpful. Loved it and Totally Recommend going. You'll be Amazed.< /Review>

<text>I liked the method of service and the restaurant's overall concept. Tables have a button to ring their Flight Attendant as you decide additional items to order. The food was tasty and portions were pretty large. The mixed drinks were well done and the wine flights were a hit. A great place to go with a moderate size group so you can order and they more things.< /text></record>

<review>Yeah right. A bunch of high schoolers running the joint. Good comes out completely random. Drinks are bright out at the end of the meal. What a total joke.

Totally different dining experience because EVERYTHING comes in flights. Great way to taste a variety of food and drink. Only downside is that if you're looking for something small, its a little harder since everything comes in 3s. You can ask for one drink but not sure the food works that way. Great place for sharing< /Review>

Flights is not what it used to be, at least not in Los Gatos. Once, they boasted a large menu of innovative dishes, each offered in a trio (a "flight") featuring variations on a theme. Each dish was well-prepared and delicious.  Unfortunately, times change.

Flights had changed hands, and the menu, and food quality, have changed with it.  The new menu still has a few flights, but the bulk of the food is offered in "bites".  This would be fine if the quality had been maintained.  Unfortunately, the new menu is loaded with food that is bland and uninspired. The "Korean" Buffalo Chicken looked fancy on the plate, but it tasted like fried chicken nuggets drizzled in Frank's Red Hot sauce. It was mostly heat and little flavor. The sliders also looked great, but tasted rather plain, even the Chipotle Beef slider, which featured avocado and corn etole. The biggest letdown was the "Reverse Cheesecake" flight that we ordered for dessert. Essentially cheesecake in three jars, each topped with different toppings. The most flavorful part of the entire flight was the Oreo crumble on the chocolate entry.  The strawberry topping was merely adequate, and the mango topping was clearly fermented. The cheesecake itself was loose and bland.

On the plus side, the wait staff was very friendly.  Still, we likely won't be back anytime soon.< /text>

Great experience. Food, presentation, service.All EXCELLENT!

We were even lucky enough to have the owner wait on our table as place was really busy and he wanted to help out his staff. But every server that helped out was always excellent. All the food was perfectly cooked and well flavored.

I normally just like Swedish Meatballs but not crazy about them. But here they are definitely a Must Have. So much flavor you want multiple orders of the appetizer to make it a meal.

Risotto with black truffle oil and mushrooms also an excellent choice.

And if you are a wine connoisseur they have an excellent and varied wine list to accommodate your tastes and price range.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will definitely be coming back the next time I return to Northern California.<//Review>

Fabulous dining experience. Food was delicious, the environment is relaxing, and the service was excellent! We had a fairly large corporate group in (about 15 people) and it was wonderful working with the staff to plan & coordinate. They were responsive, flexible, and very appreciative, which made working together a breeze. My only suggestion was that the portions were a bit small. I would definitely return though!<//text>

Grab your carry on and run the other way! I've had better meals on a real plane ride. This gimmick that calls itself a restaurant is a sad simulacrum of a good one-hour flight. I was embarrassed for the wait staff who had to recite the cheesy script about "flying with us". Also, annoyingly everything was in a flight of 3 - beer, wine, food.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>After having a sub-par experience at the Flights location in Campbell, I was hopeful that the Los Gatos location may redeem this place. I went for a birthday party with a group of girls and somehow the experience was even worse. The food was not good at all (the grilled cheese was especially disappointing- how can you mess that up so bad?), but the service was possibly the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The restaurant anyway expects you to press a button to receive service which is strange to me, but we had to press the buttons over and over to get someone to come wait on our table. We ran out of water multiple times and couldn't get anyone to bring more, we waited a very long time to have someone bring a to-go box, they didn't bus our table until we left basically so as we chatted, there was just mess everywhere, and several dishes came out cold. To top it all off, the event planner told the person who planned the night that we wouldn't need to pay a minimum when she was making the reservation, yet when the bill came, there was a minimum fee added to the bill. When we approached them, they said it's non-negotiable which was frustrating enough, but they also never pro-actively presented the opportunity to us to actually order more food/dessert to meet it so we essentially were all forced to split an extra $250 that the restaurant just pocketed since we didn't know about this minimum until we were all ready to leave. To finish out the series of unfortunate events, the waitress came up to us rudely at 9:30 to tell us we needed to leave because the restaurant had been closed for 30 minutes (again, they hadn't even bussed our table so they didn't seem to be in much of a hurry and there are much nicer ways to do this). I will never return and doubt the 13 other girls will either.

Update: The owner called and asked if they can try to make it up to us which was very kind. Will update the review if we have a better experience!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Food was better than expected but really should be half the price. Sunday brunch was chicken tenders on waffles with reasonably tasty sauces and Cole slaw. Really good eggs Benedict with BBQ pork or pork belly or bacon. Portions were not tiny. Desserts looked tasty but also heinously expensive. ($15 for three little cups of yogurt?) Expect to spend at least $50 for two. If prices were more reasonable would come back often.<//Review>

< review>
Flights in Los Gatos is far superior to the Campbell location. As I have gone to both a number of times here are my comparisions.
Both restaurants: The whole concept of Flights is very cute and a food lover's dream. The decor is air travel, the servers dress like flight attendants, and there is a call button on your table airplane style. Most of the food/drinks are served in "flights" of 3, tapas style. That isnt to say you have to share and some things, like salads and flatbreads are served in normal portions.
Campbell: Limited seating and food seems to be prepared more hastily than Los Gatos. (I'll go into more detail in my review of the campbell location).
Los Gatos: Ample indoor and outdoor seating, plus bar seating. I've only visited this location during weekday lunch hours and it is never busy, though I'm not sure why. There is also ample parking between their own small lot and the large shared lot behind the restaurant.
Food: Honestly everything I've tried has been good but I most highly recommend the ceviche, steak tacos, and Stix (way bigger than they look on the menu). I don't eat gluten or dairy and there are tons of options for me. Only thing I've tried that I would probably not order again is the sliders, they do have GF buns but they are pretty dry and the burgers aren't anything exciting.

Overall, I highly recommend Flights Los Gatos for business, groups of friends or families. It is also sure to impress out of town guests.< /review>

Food isn't very good. Beef skewers were sour, cold. The shared dip plate is a joke. Cheesecakes were pretty bad too. On top of all of this, it's ridiculously expensive for what it served. Overall negative experience, won't be visiting again.<//text>

Absolutely amazing food. Lots of flavor and gorgeously displayed. I personally had the risotto and it was fantastic. Tons of flavor and plated well. Great service overall. Found this place totally by accident after we flew in from out of town, absolutely starving. A little pricey for an out of town tourist, but if you are looking for an upscale restaurant with amazing food, make a reservation to go see this place! The interior design is also gorgeous as well.</review>

In A Nutshell:

-Flights really took off w/ a great idea.
-They serve everything, "flight" style, think 3's.
-With that being said, I was slightly disappointed w/ the service.
-I am not sure the "team" concept works very well when if your plates stack up and each team member walks by w/ out clearing the table, possibly thinking the next team member "might do it".
-As a customer you probably shouldn't have to ask, especially at this place when you know things are going to stack up pretty fast.
-The food itself was good, but can improve.
-The waffles could be warmer and less soggy.
-The bacon and beer flight took too long to come out and the bacon soaks up the beer making it soggy.
-I really liked the eggs benedict flight and would order again.

Overall, I hate writing reviews about service, but for now this place gets 3 stars.  It can easily improve and I will give it another shot.<//Text>

Flights has a fun and well executed theme and concept.  The decor is themed to the classic era of commercial aviation.  And everything on the menu comes in flights of three variations on an idea, all distinct and interesting, though you can opt to have only one or two variations if you prefer.  The ahi flight was good though not great.  I was extremely happy with all three variations on falafel, old fashioned cocktail, and cookies with ice cream.  You can probably find better single instances of anything on this menu, but if you crave diversity and variety in your dining, Flights is an excellent choice!</review>

<Review>Wow, Flights is a big upgrade from Hults. Most impressive. The back room is a cozy joint bathed in blue light. The bar is a great place to people watch. The bar and wait staff all look like they just walked off a Hollywood casting call; beautiful, tall, and elegant. Oh, and the food ain't bad either. The concept of three types of everything is innovative and well-conceived. Good place to see and be seen.<//Review><userid>103531332169990662334</userid><Time>1518058793105<//Time>< Resp>

Great place for food and wine! Had a great meal here, excellent preparation and presentation. Staff was very friendly despite being busy, and the owner made a point of introducing himself around. Good ribeye and roasted cauliflower, you will probably like whatever you get. Will definitely return next time I'm in town.< /Review>

Hult's Restaurant was an amazing dining experience.  Beautifully decorated, knowledgable and friendly staff.   My husband took me there for my birthday and we have the four course vegetarian dinner.  We brought our own wine, but they have an excellent selection of wine as well. The food was excellent, the variety of food was great and the truffle risotto was amazing....and of course, dessert was superb!

I would highly recommend going to Hult's for an excellent evening with excellent food.  We will definitely go back again.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>When I first came to Flights it was at the request of an eight year-old, so my expectations weren't very high. I'd been to the old restaurant that used to occupy the building a few times, but had never been here. It was very impressive.

The menu was wonderful, with something to fit everyone's needs. One thing to remember is that everything comes in threes (duh), so if you order some margaritas, don't be surprised when they put three in front of you!

All in all, the food was excellent, as was the service. Instead of having waiters bother you every 5 minutes making sure all is ok, you just press a button to call over a waiter when you need one. Perfect. Definitely coming back!<//text>< pics>

<Review>I sat at the bar and got a flight of wine. And an appetizer. I was ignored by the bartender, bartenders, because there were two. 20 minutes after I'd finished everything, the female bartender came over to remove what was in front of me and actually had a problem removing the dishes and glassware because they stuck to the bar do to filthy sticky bar conditions. Not to mention the flies that were protecting their food.</Review>< Pictures>

I went to the restaurant knowing that I would come out with a huge bill, but this was a little celebration and I wasn't really concerned about the money.

We chose a fairly quiet time to visit the restaurant and unlike other reviewers mentioning that the service was not great, we actually experienced fantastic service.

Food: Because we were going to be paying 2-3 times what other restaurants charge but only getting half the portions,  we were expecting our minds to be blown by the quality and look of the food. However, The food was only OK, definitely not worth the money paid for it.< /text>

The food was so-so, nothing special, but what really got under my skin is that they charge you a mandatory "kitchen benefits" fee! There is a fine print explanation stating that the fee is because they believe in "fair wages" for their hard working kitchen staff. ABSOLUTELY! By all means do that, but that is a cost that should be accrued by the owner not by the guests. If the employer can't pay his people properly that's not the customers fault. I will NOT be going back sheerly because of the shady business practices!<//Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I enjoyed our dinner there, the food was nice and good staff, just not quite *great* overall.

Maybe we were just unlucky, but the AC was out that night, which meant they had all doors open to get some fresh air in, which meant that over the course of the dinner my wife and I killed a total of 3 flies. That killed the romantic mood a bit.< /review>< pictures>

Food and Drink was decent but not much better than a typical bj's.. somewhat nice lounge area inside.  Place can be so much more than it is and really turn it up but they need help.< /Review>

The flight concept gives a good variety of flavors in one meal.  However, quality of ingredients varies: beignets are tasty but chocolate sauce is fake-tasting like Hershey syrup. Jalapeno Swiss grilled cheese has clear flavors but Brie apple grillied cheese is bland.</text>

<Review>Flight is a new place in the same location as Hults.  The breakfast menu is similar to Hults but with a spin on the concept.  This is not your traditional breakfast place.  The food was extremely good and delicious.  The menu is limited as it does not have gluten free options and if you are a vegan + gluten free - then no luck!!  Their coffee if good...they should think about adding hot chocolate.  The staff if friendly and hope they get the staffing requirement sorted out as they just opened in Jan.< /Review>< userid>

5 star when it was Hults. They are now a airline-themed restaurant called Flights. The concept and delivery was so cringe-worthy. The brunch menu was so-so but significantly lower than what I expected from Hults.

I'm sure there's a reason they felt they had to change, but I feel they are taking a nose dive here.< /review>

Staff members are second to none. The food there is great while the drinks are amazing. Matea and Joe have excellent taste in cocktails. Brandon's (B's) food reccomendations keep me trying new things every time I come in. Especially love the sliders and Swedish meat balls  look forward to bringing many parties to come!</review>

<Text>Halt don't go in there!

They serve something, poorly, but it is not food.  It is certainly not worth the prices that they charge.  Calamari that looked like deep fried chicken strips from a truck stop, a salad with tasteless tomatoes and a turkey sandwich that is worse than from a school lunchroom.   Do yourself a favor and stay away.<//Text>< time>

However, of the multitude of dishes that my party tried (martinis, IPAs, empanadas, calamari, meatballs, shrimp, meat tacos, and cookies), we all agreed that only the empanadas were good and the tacos were amazing. I also really liked the cookies, but the rest of my party likes cookies prepared differently. One *major* drawback was how many houseflies were everywhere, and how they kept buzzing around us and our food and landing on us and interrupting our meal (the were all over the windows wanting to get out but couldn't). Otherwise, would I go back? I really liked that tacos and empanadas and cookies, so maybe.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1533967480408, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

Amazing food! I love this stuff.  I heard good things so I had to try it for myself.  My girlfriend and I went ahead and ordered al a carte and everything was amazing.  Wish this restaurant the best.  My friends and family will be told of your amazing food.  The only complaint is the parking sucks.  No offense guys.  It's just true.  But that's hardly a reason not to go.  Besides walking that far made me feel better from gorging over the ridiculously good food.< /Review>

My wife and I met a few other couples for an evening out and we are so glad we chose Hult's!  I am bummed Google gives you a max of 5 stars as the meal was 10 stars+!  We shared appetizers and every one of them was awesome!  Each bite tasted like a piece of Autumn...roasted squash soup, sweet potato ravioli, Swedish meatballs, pork, etc!  We shared entrees around too...the salmon with caviar was amazing, elk medallions tender and delicious, duck was outstanding with a blend of sauces like we've never had before, etc.  And then there was the filet and NY strip entrees...spectacular!  And then we all shared pumpkin creme brûlée which was soooooooo good, the chocolate sphere which was decadent, and an apple bread pudding with accompanying toppings!  My wife and I are foodies and this place knocks it out of the park!  Service...great!  Food...outstanding!  Great wine list!  Too many restaurant menus look and taste like one another but Hult's is very different and extremely good!  Treat yourself to a great night out...you'll be glad you did at Hult's!</Text>

This place is OK but nothing special. The burrata was bland at best (and I'm well aware it's not supposed to have a strong flavor but this was literally flavorles). The scallops weren't properly seared and they were served with lukewarm soggy grapefruit slices. By boyfriend's steak was incredible (and, unlike the scallops, came with a sear) but his potatoes were cold. The wait staff were super friendly but there were few glitches you wouldn't expect at a nice restaurant like this (brought us the wrong drink and forgot we had asked for desert menu until we reminded them 20 minutes later).< /Review>

Stopped here to use the restroom on our adventure to capitola. The staff was sweet and let us. But since the place seemed so interesting we stayed for a drink. Unaware at first the prices on their menu was the price for a flight of whichever drink u choose. I assumed for a just a glass of chardonnay it was 18$ but thats the price for three chardonnays lol so dont be fooled. The staff was amazing in explaining to me and was super helpful in assisting me with what to drink. Their uniforms are legit pilot uniforms which made me want to work there. And the location was right off the freeway making it super convenient. Definitly will visit again.</text>

Had the Tacos, which were ok. The corn tortillas were dry, and chewy. The Al pastor needs some work, chicken was good. I had an old fashion again just ok. The staff (sat at the bar) were very attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is a step down from Hults but I understand, lower cost menu selection will bring in more clients.

Take 2
Went back this time only for drinks, started with a flight of old fashions. Just like last time they were disappointing, would not recommend. Then I ordered a flight of mules which I did enjoy. The Mexican mule was not my favorite and would not want again, but the other two were very good.  I paid for each flight as the brought them to me and each time I was charged that "kitchen" fee. You would think that since I did not have any food the staff would NOT charge that fee. You should not make a customer ask to have a fee removed the bar staff should Doo that automatically or maybe the software that you use for billing would be set only to add that fee when food is ordered. The service was very good from the bar staff. Sara was the bartender that poured my drinks. Still have work to do, but since I live about 2 blocks away I might go back. I hope they can fix that "kitchen" fee.< /text>

The idea of every item on the menu is a "flight" of three, with the wait staff pretending to be flight attendants is a bit gimmicky. The food is essentially bar food. Okay, but not really *that* good to justify the higher prices.  It's also not what I'd call tapas.<//Text>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>Ok food, way over priced. Almost everything comes in groups of 3. (Shrimp dish only gives 2 coconut shrimp, which is the best variety, plus 3 grilled & 3 steamed shrimp.)

The food is in-between; more like appetizers, not a meal, but priced like a meal. Nothing was exceptional. Three of us had 3 chicken strips (ok), 3 pork sliders (ok), 8 pieces of shrimp (ok), fries ($11), & 3 sets of drinks (the server said a set of 3 is the equivalent of 1.5 regular drinks, but they're priced like 2 drinks at $18-$19 ea) for a bill over $130 ($150 incl tip!) Really expensive for what you get. Atmosphere is ok, but not special. Noisy.  Service was ok. The model of no single server per table, but all servers serving all tables means no  server table ownership & marginal service. We always had to ask to have basic waiter duties done, i.e. clear plates, water, etc.

There are a lot of better $50 per person, dining options for what Flights provides. If it were really great food & service, I'd happily return again & again since I live in LG. I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately it's a miss as a dinner place.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have been here a few times. First time was my son's 9th birthday, and everything from service, food, portions, environment, and atmosphere was wonderful.  We choose this restaurant as our usual place for business dinners now because of how great everything went our first time. Everytime we go they never fail us. Thanks to the whole team at Hults.< /Text>

Great service and cocktails.  Food was bland and very small portion wise.

My $12 salad was 7 pieces of lettuce and a few cubes of feta.< /review>

<Text>The quality of the ingredients and the care in preparation really shined through in the main courses. We especially loved the plank filet (and the *amazing* duchesse potato), the duck breast, the mushroom risotto, and the roasted salmon. We also really liked the calamari, octopus, shrimp, and pork belly appetizers. But the Toast Skagen and bacon-wrapped dates (skip the blue cheese) were a little less interesting. The desserts were quite good too. The only real disappointment was the cocktails, which were a little bland and IMO would have benefited from a bit more alcohol flavor.

The 2nd time we went, we ordered two different steak dishes and both were delicious but would have been a lot better if they hadn't shown up luke-warm. Dropping a star until I can confirm that this was an aberration (it *was* very crowded that night).</Text>< rate>
