I was trying to resolve an issue with a simple flip phone that just died after four months of service. The phone belongs to my 89 year old mother who has dementia. Just wanted to get it replaced. The sales person requested mom's picture ID which I did not have with me. I have POA for mom but do not carry a copy with me .
So, even with my mother present and providing all account info I could not get her defective phone replaced.
I intend to close her account and select a provider with customer support.
I personally am not a Verizon customer and never will be after this lack of support< /Text>

<date>1612390862396<//date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>This morning, a salesperson at this location sold a phone to someone fraudulently using my account information. According to Verizon Wireless, the salesperson used a "manager exception", so a PIN was not required. The salesperson also did not ask for proof of identification. If they had followed proper protocol and required the individual to give the account PIN and show proof of identification, the sale would not have proceeded. My local police department suggested it was an inside job. I have filed a police report with the City of Visalia and reported the fraud claim to Verizon. Bottom line: DON'T SHOP HERE.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The 2 guys outside were kind of snooty and actually said "we don't have any phones right now. Only the iPhone and new Galaxy". Come on, it's freaking Verizon.
Go across the parking lot to Best Buy.< /review>

The most frustrating thing is when you need to call to ask a store person a simple question, but they route their calls to corporate automatically.  Now I get to go drive 20 minutes to see if they have replacement S-pens for the Note 20 Ultra.<//Review>

Looking to upgrade & she was willing to share her own personal experience with both of the 2 different brands of phones she owns & asked another associate to share her experiences with the 3rd phone I was comparing. Great info and- best of all- no pressure to buy that day.  Will totally be buying my next phone here.</Review><Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

I am not satisfied with the customer service I just received here today at the Visalia Mooney store on
4007 S . Mooney blvd. Visalia ,ca 93277. I contacted version and spoke with the representative and they sent me to a corporation store near my home.
Due to the Covid there’s a limit of people that can go in the store but first you have to check in. I’ve checked in and One of the guy name “ Omar “ helped me with my account and it seems like they were telling me differently then what the representative told me over the phone. I told him I was going to contact Verizon again and he told me they would have more authority then In store. And he told me to let him know after I speak to them . Well kid you not I was on hold on the phone with Verizon for over 45 mins which is understandable due to less people working due to Covid and So my BATTERY went down to 2% and so I was trying to get attention from one of the guy who worked here because he was helping the 2 ladies beside me. After helping them He didn’t even acknowledge me that I was even there and went to go help the other people way across from me ..so I got another person’s attention which he notice the whole thing that just happened and he even notice that I was already there before the other people . I told him that I’m currently on the phone with Verizon and they have me on hold and that my battery life is at 2%. I told him I don’t want my phone to die on me just because I’ve  been on the phone for more than 45 mins now. He told me he would ask regarding them letting me charge my phone or even letting me use the charger. 2 mins later he came back and told me that the person he spoke with inside stated they couldn’t help me with the charger and that if my phone dies on me then oh well. It’s not their problem. He also stated that it’s Due to certain limit of people allowed. Which I told him that I understand and that I’m not even trying to go inside. I can charge my phone outside . And I told him I just really need to use a charger.. and he told me again that the person inside don’t care and That it’s not his problem. I told the guy that it was really rude especially when I’m here at a verizon store. I’m sure they have a charger or whatever to help their customers while still waiting here. And a Verizon customer who not just have 1 line on the account but have 4 lines. So the guy who I was talking too that worked there lend me his charger from his car. Which was very nice of him. People like that are the ones who should be getting a raise and getting promoted. I am writing this review while in my car using one of the workers charger and it’s about 1& 30 mins on hold after being transferred 3 Time .<//text>

Love going to this store! They always help me with exactly what I need and they are fast and efficient! I've been with is company for over 12 years and i have never been unsatisfied. If there is anything wrong with my phone they are more then helpful in getting it fixed! Just recently I had just upgraded my phone and when I stared it up I found that I had no mic when I took it back in they replaced the phone and waved the restocking fee!!! Thank you guys for the great customer service and always doing such a good job!! Much appreciation!</Review>

Rude help with an attitude and that I was interrupting their conversation with each other. I found out that although I had purchased my phone charger from a Verizon store this Verizon store would not take the broken product back. I gave my phone to the rude woman and asked to buy another charger for it (and I kept the broken one to return to the other Verizon store).  I purchased said charger and left, needless to say the charger was the wrong one and I was already out of state when I found out.< /text>

I always have a great experience at the store thanks to Stephen. I've dealt with him and only him for the past 4 years and love his honesty, knowledge and professionalism. Request him when you go in and I guarantee you won't regret it😁<//review>

DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!! Worst service ever!! Charged $20 to put apps on the phone that are already there. Do not give receipts to explian charges. After trying to return items from being overcharged without proper explanation, they run you in circles saying they will help but they don't.  You're better off ordering online to avoid this store at all cost, because it will cost you a lot once you walk out!</Text>

I will NEVER go back to this store again! Management and store employees are not helpful and they don't care to provide good customer service. The service I received a month before at the Mooney store was outstanding compared to this store. Don't waste your time here, go across town.</text>

Verizon is one of my least favorite companies to deal with. They have very good coverage but TRULY treat their over paying customers like there's. I paid$800 each for my and my phone that's= to 1600$ both of our phones had issues {both our 800$ new phones) they send us remanufactured phones at $150 each it takes me another 30 days to figure out that the flash isn't working. This isn't the first remainUFACTURED  that was defective and always the same comment OH SORRY YOU WENT PAST YOUR 30 DAYS.< /text>

<Text>Sadly Verizon has really lost its way. The solutions expert I talked to simply told me that my ideas wouldn’t work - without giving me an alternative solution. Verizon’s policies have, in my opinion, shifted away from being “customer friendly”.< /Text>< user_name>

<review>Not happy with their new idea of not setting up your phone at the store. You must take home and transfer all contacts and apps at home.  Fine if there is not a problem but when you do have one you have to call and have someone help you over the phone.   Well as we all know you must go through the process of the dreadful automated system. Press 1 for... press 2 for... uuugghhhjhj!!!!!</review><pics>None<//pics><Time>1535322926865</Time>< rate>

Total nightmare. Why was it so hard to get my device going? I, not only had to wait an hour to get to set up,  I had to come back the next day because I couldn't make or receive basic calls, which meant I had to spend another hour standing. And I still don't know if it'll work till I hook it up to my phone. Which means I'd have to come back again. What a tech nightmare. Im blue-balling here in frustration.< /review>

Outstanding customer service, courteous, prompt and brief wait times, staff conducts themselves in a professional manner both with customers and peer-to-peer interactions while on the sales floor, a real teamwork environment. Everyone is so positive and compassinate, I feel completely comfortable having the kids in here, with parental supervision of course. Jonathan Jovel was my Solutions Specialist and he went above and beyond, when I returned right before closing to finish up my transaction with him, I was unable to work with him again due to time restraints, but he still made sure to excuse himself briefly to catch me before reaching my car to ensure I was totally taken care of and that my results were the same as if he'd been able to continue helping me. Hands down, the best sales team and management I've come across since my military days, I am rarely easily impressed because I expect quality not quantity! Keep up the awesomeness!</review>

<review>I've been with the company for 16 years, have generally always had at least decent service. Even during peak hours and long wait times at other locations it was worth it because at least I knew I would get the assistance I needed. At this location however, I waited over 30 minutes with my little girl trying to add a line for her. After finally being helped, they said that if I was to add her I would lose my unlimited data plan that I've had for over 15 years. They were extremely rude!! Explaining if I wanted to add my little girl all I would have to do is give up my unlimited data plan. Forget the long time dedication to the company. Screw over your most loyal customers!!! I would've understood the circumstances and accepted the situation, had the staff not been so blatantly rude and inconsiderate.</review><username>denny kong</username>< Date>

Here’s my experience: went in when my phone started giving me a “no SIM card” message even though a SIM card was in my phone. The employee turned my phone on and off and then told me it was a hardware problem that Apple needed to fix. He was nice enough to print out directions to an Apple store in Bakersfield. Over an hour later I’m in Bakersfield, at the correct mall, but I don’t see the Apple store, so I go into another Verizon store to ask where the Apple store was. While I was in there, I also explained my situation. The Verizon employee in Bakersfield, Carlos, says ‘a SIM card error? We can get you a new one here, you shouldn’t have to go to an Apple store’ and then in about 5 minutes he fixes my phone and gives me a new SIM Card. So Verizon Visalia, why couldn’t you do that? Why did your staff only know how to turn my phone off and on? It’s a three star review and not a one star because the staff at this Verizon store in Visalia did print out directions for me which I rly appreciated.< /text>

I went in there today, and walked out with an awesome phone, picked up the Moto z2, and I love it, can't wait to buy some of the attachments, they are very knowledgeable and fast I was in and out in less then 29 minutes, wow.

I don't feel they even deserve 1 start but this site won't let me post without one. Absolute worst service I have ever received. The manager Rene Arredondo has no business working in customer service. I came in Friday to inquire about a huge charge on my bill and he argued with me then disappeared to the back for 30 minutes. Then came out and made up some excuses and said he would call me with more info before 5pm Friday. It is now Monday and he still hasn't called so I called him and all he could do was argue with me saying it's my fault for going to Apple to get my phone. I think it's my fault for staying with Verizon if these are the types of people they hire.< /Review>

I have been a customer of verizon for over 12 years.  I will never buy another piece of equipment from them and be bound to them by a contract.  I bought a new unlocked phone from Best Buy but needed a different sim card. Verizon phone support said I could get one via mail or go to a verizon store and get one for free. I choose to go to the store. Araceli helped me she told me she could not give me a sim card they had to activate the phone for me. Then she tells me that since it is not a Verizon phone they cannot activate it. I have had unlocked phones before I know all I need to do is put the sim card in it. I ask if she has an adaptor for the sim card to work in my current phone. No if they make them they don't carry them... So basically since I had not bought a Verizon phone they couldn't help me....apparently the $250 I pay a month in service fees mean nothing. Even though Verizon would have sent me an unactivated sim card the store will not allow it.  I went to best buy, told them what had happened, I leave best buy with a free sim card, which I put in my new phone and suddenly my phone is a Verizon phone. I go online and register my new phone and sim card...and suddenly my new unlocked phone works... Thank you Araceli for lying to a customer and doing nothing to help me...to what get a sale? I will NEVER walk into a Verizon store again, and I will never be under contract again.  I am giving 1 star because I can't post this with selecting a star rating.<//Review>

<Text>Very rude and negative there. Laugh at people behind there back.. I think that is very unprofessional for them especially if management is part of it. Will never be going to that store and i think other people shouldn't either.</Text>< pics>

most affordable smog I’ve ever gotten, Stellar customer service. Was also very quick. If you’re short on time and on a budget, come here. They’re very quick and reasonably priced. The owner/manager was very friendly and Attentive, he kindly greeted me, turned the heater on to make sure I was comfortable, offered me a seat or the option to wait outside for social distancing. He even parked my car in a direction where all I had to do was drive off easily onto the main rode. I’ve never had to not back out my own car so that was cool. It was the small details like that that made it such a smooth experience</review>

I called to make sure they were open due to the holiday. I got in and out within 15 minutes, probably less. He was friendly, affordable and quick. Will definitely go again.</review>< pics>

Good, quick service. Like it's advertised, $38 for a smog check ($29.75+$8.25 for the certificate) for most cars 2000 and newer.<//Review>

I was actually on my way to another smog shop. The sign with the price is what caught my eye (& very glad it did)... I was in & out faster then it took for me to do 2 scratcher tickets.. 🤗 Very fast, professional & most of all friendly.. 👍👍< /Text>

Don't go to this place they are crooks. The owner told me he wouldn't charge me to retest and when I went in for a retest I was charged again!! So I ended up paying 68.75 to have my car smogged not 38.75!! I'll never go there again and I will be complaining to the better business Bureau.</review>

Very nice people did the smog fast I have no complaints about this company. They did not rip me off. Other people were there also said they were very happy as well, I don't know why there are bad reviews on here. I will use them again and tell people to go here for their smogs!</Text>

When I came in they said there were 3 people waiting and I wouldn't be helped for another 20 minutes. I explained that was the reason why I scheduled an appointment and they said it wasn't in the system. I pulled out my phone to show them that I had received a text confirming my appointment & they said to leave my number & they would call me when there was someone available to assist me. 20 minutes later & I'm still waiting.</text>< user_name>

How is it that I have the sprint flex lease which allows me to upgrade after 12 months (which it has been) but the associate at the store here said I still need to pay $200 to own the phone that I'm essentially turning in to upgrade? WHAAAAT???! terrible service reps If you ask me, they just want your money.<//text>

Unfortunately there’s no zeros otherwise I would, Big fat liars, they promise you so much to have a sale but at the end you end up on a big caos and headache and apparently it’s a CORPORATE store , if it was they would have better trained personnel, specially HONEST AND PROFESSIONAL   and then Sprint Customer Service, can’t or won’t  be able to help you with all the mess they did.... PLEASE DON’T DO BUSINESS at least at this store</review>

I called from a different store to see if they had a SIM card to activate an iPhone I bought for my daughter. I gave the info the store I was at gave my the number for the SIM card the lady that answered took the info and asked me to hold. I drove 15 minutes on hold to arrive at the store and when I got there still on hold, the store had on employee on his phone. The lady was helping get change for someone else’s client. The phone was just laid on its side. After a a minute she walked to the counter and asked if she could help me. I said yes I think you have me on hold she said on hold looking confused. Then said sorry how can I help you......... what’s with that service my sprint store off Newport blvd in Tustin would never do something like that!< /Review>

Bad customer service, the first time they always are happy, but if you want to cancel the service or want diferent service they become upset, my son want to cancel the service we went two or three times and they always said that the computer was down, unfortunately my son went alone and an  employee took his cell phone but the computer was down again and he told my son that he can't make  the receipt, because, but i will put on the system as soon the computer working and now my son has to pay for the cell. Definitely bad service.< /Review>

this place is convenient because its close to home. BUT ITS EXTREMELY SHADY!!!!! they FORCE YOU into getting a plan. how? they tell you that theres no other plans available. I went to upgrade my contract and get the new iPhone 6. When i went inside to upgrade they told me THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN UPGRADE is if you get the "iPhone for Life" i just wanted a two year contract. Their response was "NO YOU CANT DO THAT ANYMORE"...i had no choice but to get it. I call sprint the next day and they tell me that what their doing is not mandated. THE CUSTOMER DOES HAVE THE OPTION TO GET ANY PLAN THEY WANT REGARDLESS OF THE PHONE. this location just lost my trust and I am telling future and current customers NOT TO TRUST THIS STORE.</review>

Employees believe that policy is one thing, but when you call corporate, they contradict store employees and then redirect you to them.  You are on your own with Sprint.  Do not expect any thing other than a greeting or an "I'm sorry".<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

(Translated by Google) Nothing out of the ordinary, its service is very regular. Spanish is spoken and the office hours are fine. Whenever I have gone I find parking. And the store is very well located, it is possible to see it from the street. They always have the newest equipment in terms of cell phones and sometimes there are good promotions.

(Translated by Google) BEWARE They offer you a price but you end up paying another one I bought an IPhone they told me that the airphones were free and I ended up paying $ 16.00 each month the chika gave us a protector for the IPhone and even a screen protector and I ended up paying for them
The worst you tell me you have Automatic payment for a discount now they stole the $ 500 for 4 lines
It is a robbery and a mockery
What a little mother

<UserId.>104047618629982367474</UserId.><text>Found a 1985 Nighhawk 700S on Simi Valley Cycle's website.  Called and talked to Rick who was very helpful and honest about the condition of the bike.  I was 700 miles away but decided to take him on his word that the bike was in excellent condition.  My son and I drove down and it was as he said, perfect.  Rick was great to work with and it was a very easy and fast purchase.  Everyone at the shop was very nice and helpful. They helped me load it up in my truck and get me on my way back home.  All in all it was a great experience working with Rick and Simi Valley Cycle.  Only wish they were closer.<//text><Date>1611700656554< /Date>< resp>

Always a joy coming to this place.  Great/friendly knowledgeable customer service, their mechanics are experts and their prices are reasonable.   💯

Also, don’t listen to some of these negative reviews.  The entire team knows what their doing and are very friendly.  Not to mention their prices are amazing.  Set of tires cost me cheaper than ordering them online, AND they had them in stock, AND installed them the same day! (with a discount for buying them their) Can’t beat that.< /text>

<Review>Looking for a jet ski and just got off the phone with the sales guy. He said "sorry the owner put a ridiculous price on it... $16K". As a Yamaha Dealer, this is tru price gouging! MSRP is $9k. I'll take my business elsewhere and I would recommend you do the same.</Review><name>Dominic Barbaria< /name>< Rating>

Over the  years  I've purchased  from a lot  of  company's but  I  have to say dealing with Simi valley cycles has  been probably one of the  best  experiences  I've  ever  had , Rick  was   the  salesman  I dealt with and it was great, at  every level from  the  purchase  to the delivery  of  the quad and always responding  to calls . You guys  set  a standard  that others  should  learn from you, THANK YOU  SIMI VALLY CYCLES  AND  ALL THAT  HELPED  TO MAKE IT A SMOOTH DEAL.........JOHN HOLDER<//text>

Bought my motorcycle from there recently and as soon as I walked in I felt at ease and unrushed, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Plus next door is a killer bbq spot. Both are a must visit.</text>

< review>
"They are a genuinely nice and knowledgeable staff. I ride from Los Angeles to patronize Simi Valley Cycles. In 2019 I had an emergency right before a vacation. I damaged my tires hitting debris on the 101 freeway. They went out of their way to get my tires and have them mounted so I could make my trip. Because of that first impression. I am a loyal customer. Recently I needed tires again, their price was better than anyone around. Ive taken my bike for oil changes and brake pads and received quality work and quick turnaround. I highly recommend them."<//review>

Same rating and review left on Yelp!

Executive Summary:
If I could give this business a 'zero' rating, I would.  One star is too much.  Don't waste your time and find another Triumph Service location.

Details:
Scheduled the break-in service for my Triumph with this place thinking they would be a good place to establish a Service relationship for the future of my motorcycle ownership; bad move!
The Service Rep Chris (spelling?) was rude, condescending, and disrespectful.   He didn't get up from his chair or bother to look me in the eye while I arrived at the Service area.  Which, by the way is tucked in the back, like you're going into someone's backyard...
Anyway, as he proceeded to ask his questions, he was giving out the feeling that he was bothered by my presence and couldn't wait to get me out of there.  Not sure if he was having a bad day, but it was right after they had opened and it couldn't have been better in terms of outside temperatures (after a scorching Southern California summer).

His demeanor was so rude and condescending that I asked if he had something against me or a problem with me bringing my bike for service.  Obviously, he says no...

I decided to go somewhere else, asked for my keys and left; that was the best decision, other than buying a Triumph, to-date!
LA Cycle Sports took care of me, paid attention to what I was asking, and took the time to explain the service.  They were on my bike right away without an appointment.  Talk to Joey there, he will take care of you and respect your questions/concerns.<//review></record>

<review>I worked with Joe and Rick to purchase a 2018 Beta 300rr and I couldn't be happier! The process was straightforward with no surprises or shenanigans. These guys appreciate your time and business, I will definitely be back for my another bike. They had the bike ready, signed the paperwork, out the door and on my way home in less than 45 minutes.< /review>< Pics>

This place should be an historical landmark. It's been in business in the same location since 1967! It's a family business with a family feel. Parts, apparel, 3 different brands of motorcycles, Suzuki, Yamaha and Triumph. Duane and crew will treat you right, give them a call!<//Text>

Was a bit concerned buying a bike over the internet. The people there were very patient answering all of my questions. The staff was extremely helpful, going so far as to pick me up from the train station when I came down to see the bike. The condition of the bike was exactly as described and the deal was exactly what we had agreed to on the phone. I have over 20 years in the auto business and I would recommend Simi Valley Cycles above anyone I have felt with. Great people, great service definitely worth checking out.<//Review>

Bought my first bike here 6 weeks ago - in short, walked out the door with a Yamaha R3 with 97 miles on it at a crazy rad price and couldn't be happier. I've upgraded with some minor mods, light details and got my license since that glorious day in late July.
Melvin and Kevin were great, and have called every few weeks to check in on the status of the bike. Although I haven't needed anything yet, I know they'll be there when I do. Thanks guys!</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1573167250295, 'text': "Nobody can please this customer. All this info was written under anger due to this guy crashing his new bike with 14 miles. He did not get his bike here, thank you, he was mean when he 1st came in, however we treat all customers like Family. Service quoted him a price to make his bike new, (we would never quote undamaged parts), but Brett decided to do the minimum, which we quoted $700. We also told Brett a part was backordered for 3 weeks. When Brett said he called and spoke to someone, it was a salesperson that knew nothing about his bike. Should have called Service. When we finished the bike the Tech test rode it. The Bike was not ridable when it came in and we suggested a brake rotor. Brett authorized it knowing it takes 1 week to have the part here and would be $1000 total. It was done on time, detailed too. So we did everything to help this customer. We have one of the best Triumph Tech's in the Industry who takes pride in his work. Some people can never be happy."}</Response>< text>
I really wanted to like this company. I am new to town, and they are my local service department. But what an absolute disappointment.
My bike needed minor repairs from a minor accident. A week and a half went by, and I never heard from them. I had to call them. The guy that answered the phone admittedly didn’t know anything about the bike, and gave me a $3000 invoice. That was obviously wrong, and he was listing parts that were never damaged.
I traveled down there, and it was $700.
Another week goes by, they tell me the bike will be ready.
The week I’m supposed to pick it up, they say they discovered another part that requires repair. So they keep the bike.
In all, they had the bike for seven weeks, the price jumps to 1k.
What a disappointing experience, and a disappointing company. This was not a positive experience. They will not receive future business from me, and they have lost future positive word of mouth.
My advice for all of you seeking a repair shop, look elsewhere. Of all the bike shops I’ve worked with, this is the most weak. They should not be carrying the Triumph name.</text>

So I was just reading some of the low reviews and you can tell these are the guys that just want everything done for free on their timeline. I am in no way connected to Simi cycles however I have been in Simi my whole life. I have done business with them for close to 20 years. I have never purchased anything but I went with a good friend he bought a Yamaha yxz from then and got an excellent price and great service. I have had them do many services for my toys and always pull through. Last year I had a rhino that I just installed long travel on and one axle blew up. I called them and brought it in and repaired it the next day. They even waited a half hour after hours in the rain for me to be able to pick up my part for a trip the next day. The service from these guys is what you expect from a home town family business and nothing less. They didn't have to wait after hours for me but they did. They will continue to get my business and referalls</review>

<Review>Simi Valley Cycles - Duane runs a great shop and has always been helpful with rider support. Small but awesome shop, good prices and parts needed are generally in stock or quick to get. Give them a try as you will not be disappointed. Ask for Duane and tell him to that Nick sent you!

Suzuki, Yamaha and Beta, motocross and street... I’ve been a customer since the late 90’s and still make the 45 minute drive each way.<//Review>< Pics>

Updated and edited review: Customer service in the service department can be bad. (My story below.) If you want service work done in Simi... you may want to consider one of the other options in town.

I've bought high end gloves and occasional parts here. Very large selection of bikes, great selection of gloves during the summer, smaller selection in the winter. Good selection of other gear.  Some of their sales people seem pretty cool, although I've never actually shopped for a motorcycle here.

My last experience here is the last time I'll go here for service at least, maybe last time ever.  (I MIGHT still check this place out when shopping for bikes, because their selection is seriously impressive.) I took a wheel and tire in to get mounted. A day and a half later, I still hadn't heard from them.  I called to find out what was taking so ridiculously long. Turns out they had just "forgotten" to call me to let me know it was done. I went in to pick it up, and they charged me twice what it should have cost. I commented on the insane price--the person checking me out still didn't realize there was a problem.  I thought I'd just gotten screwed, paid my bill and left, never to return.  After leaving a scathing review here, they called me, apologized claiming it was a mistake, and refunded half of my money. This brought the cost down to a reasonable $25 (approx. w/ tax and disposal fee).  Was it an unforgivable mistake?  No, but why bother going back here when there are so many other shops that have treated me quite well?  This explains why all my friends would say "Eh... they're okay... but I go to _______" about this place. YMMV.< /review>

I brought my pride and joy Suzuki VL 1500 in for service today to have a new rear tire mounted. The service was Excellent and the price point was outstanding. When I picked up my bike the servicing technician came out and spent some time with me explaining a few things. Really nice guy and knowledgeable too. This is my first experience with Simi Valley Cycles And I must say I’m very impressed and will be back.< /Text>

"I put my Moto Guzzi on consignment and 15 minutes after signing the paperwork, the ad on the SVC website was live. I then made a new motorcycle purchase which was executed flawlessly by the SVC Team. All staff are caring and knowledgeable. I got an amazing price on my new V-Strom and I am one very happy customer. I worked with the parts department on getting new panniers and got a great discount. Financing was easy and explained very clearly to me. I've been riding motorcycles for some 30 years and this is hands down the best buying experience I've ever had. Thanks guys! Great job!!! Neal"< /Text>

<Name>John G<//Name><Text>Good motorcycle store. They service all types and brands. Great tire prices but you must ask for the best price. They deal Yamaha , Triumph and some quads don't know the brand. Parts guys are good and knowledgeable, service dept guys are personable. Sales guys are sales guys bahaha made myself laugh they're nice guys too. They have used bikes of all types. And a nice big flat parking lot that's easy to maneuver in. 3/29/19 just had a bad experience, I'm now wondering if its under new management or ownership. I'm not gonna stop going but I'm going to have to really hold them to there word. So we'll see. I'll keep it at four stars for now. (Check that) A couple days later I just need to mention. The bad experience here forced me to another town and bike shop. Now I do business over there and get services as well, better pricing and willingness to work with you. At SVC the service department and parts department are separated.(this is a bad thing). This process has caused some of my problems they really need to get together and standardize the parts department & service department . It would be nice to do business in the town where I live. . .</Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Just got my bike back this morning, they couldn't help at all, plus they lost screws and hose in the shop, and the guy I had to deal with really wasn't nice.. That's the very short story..  Never again

I feel like my reply to your comment wasn't showed here so..

NO

Didn't find my hose, neither my safety staples and some screws..

Say what you want your service was terrible I paid 90$ for nothing and I have to buy stuff for my bike that you lost..

But I let the people be judge..

Thanks again for nothing</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1558132218895, 'text': 'Sorry for your incorrect review. Your angry because your bike needs a fuel pump and has low compression in 1 cylinder. We supplied you with a complete list of parts because you chose not to have us fix your bike. You admitted you found your hose and we did not loose any screws. However if you talked to Duane the GM he always does what it takes to make a customer happy. The service guys were very nice to you, guess there is no happiness in a broken bike. Not our fault. Good luck'}< /Resp>

I was decided on what I wanted before contacting Duane, just needed the bike available and correct price. He contacted me when he said he would, and made a fair deal for me. Never pushy, happy to answer my questions, and appreciated my business. They also helped me out with parts, and ordered what I needed for pick up day.</Review>

Literally the entire staff deserves recognition for their consistently outstanding service. I got a brand new bonneville t120 black and haven't stopped grinning since it was delivered. Just took it in for it's first scheduled service and sweet baby Jesus they've got it purring. 10/10 would recommend.</Review>

<Text>Was out in Simi Valley to meet my friend for a ride. I had no side mirrors on my Yamaha R6 (long story) and I needed something to get me by til the ones I ordered came in the mail. Well for $13.00 I got a side mirror, looked ugly but it worked. Looked at the new bikes and wasn't overly bothered by salespeople other than the quick greeting when coming in and a short talk about older bikes. Seems like a decent place with knowledgeable people.  This will be one of my stops next year when looking to buy a new bike.< /Text></record>

You cant get any better Service for your Triumph then these guys, they really know their stuff, and I know because I am always adding parts to my Bonneville and driving them crazy over there but they always come up with something!!!

<text>Simi Valley Cycles takes the time to care for their customers, even long after the sale is made. Staff, all the way up to the ownership took the time to ensure the customer is 100% satisfied and cared for. Although a misunderstanding, they took the time to make it right, and that speaks volumes in who they are, what they stand for and their position as pillar in Simi Valley community as locally owned and operated business.

Thank you SVC!<//text>< userid>

They do test rides which other bike shops don't allow, I got a way better deal on the bike and trade-in than the other bike shop, and Rick in sales as well as the other staff in parts and service were all just great people.

I called on Thursday and Rick gave me a quote. Saturday morning drove 2 hours to get to SVC. Upon arrival met Rick. He showed me the bike which was already prepped for a test ride. 1 hour later after enjoying a nice conversation with the Finance Manager the bike was in the back of my truck heading home. Will definitely buy from SVC again. A+< /text>

We bought two quads, one for my wife and the other for my son along with helmets and gear for the whole family! It was an easy process and joe was always there to answer our questions. Thanks again, Joe and Simi Valley Cycles.</text>

<review>I bought my first Triumph Speed Triple from SVC and from the first time I walked in there my experience has been great. The sales staff, parts guys and service techs are all very friendly and took care of me. This is a great place to buy and have your bike serviced.<//review></record>

I asked him a few questions on the bike he answered them all. The i asked to test ride the bike. Immediately he had a bike ready to test. I loved the bike and we sat down to discus the cost. In less than 10 minutes we had a deal. When I told my buddies at the Rock Store how much i paid their jaws dropped Awesome people, no pressure, congenial and reasonable.

Nicest, friendliest, most honest place to buy from. I bought my very first m/c from Duane back in 1994, I did go to the "Mega M@II" place once to buy my son a kx85 and service/prep was non-existant. Will never shop anywhere else when I get the urge for 2 wheels! I also like the fact they are local and have what is needed. Don't hesitate to shop here, help keep the small businesses going so we don't have to resort to shopping on the computer.< /text>

Would highly recommend this place. Went in with only a basic idea of what I was looking for, and Paul was incredibly helpful and obviously cared more about finding the right bike for me, and not his paycheck.

I am really glad I went to Simi Cycles to look at the Triumph motorcycles. I visited a place out in the valley and I thought their prices were a little high.

Simi Cycles prices on these were great, and they know alot about there products to.

Good staff.< /text>

We recently purchased a 2018 YZ450 from SVC, what a great experience.  The bike has a new ignition and electronics which we were unfamiliar with. Duane and his team took time to be sure we understood how it worked and we were completely satisfied.  I have bought a lot of motorcycles in my life and SVC has the best sales, service and parts team anywhere.  It is a pleasure just walking into the store. Thanks to you all!</Text>

Do not go to SVC for a new bike or used. There sales department look like they hired 2 bums off the street. The 2 bums Steven and Joe from sales were jerks. They told me I wouldn't qualify for fiancing based on there opinions. Again there opinions, Not the lenders. Very unprofessional facility. I left that s$!thole and took my business to TRI-county powersports where i got treated with respect & dignity. Also, I left with a beautiful honda the same day which i got financed thru Honda. Ask for Tyler. He is an awesome dude. And the sales manager Larry was also awesome..... AGAIN AVOID SIMI VALLEY CYCLES!!!!!!< /text>

<Date>1530731650500</Date><Text>Ok, let me start by saying that i am a pain in the **s kind of customer.  I shop and look and test drive and shop and shop, and i am always afraid of paying too much.  i also don't like bike dealers sales staff in general as these guys just do not listen.

Now, let me say how AWESOME my experience was, and i cannot tell you the last time i even took the time to make a review...maybe once 8 years ago?

These guys are quick, painless, professional, honest, and even friendly!  Rick took the lead as i was internet lead, and answered every question i asked and he knew the programs off the top of his head (one dealer i went to didn't even know they had low interest finance or that extras were included in the sale from the manufacturer!)  Every time i sent an email i got one back no matter how little the question was. No one ever told me they would need me to set up a "VIP Appointment" to get the best deal!!!!  lol!!!

Pricing?  They won't get beat, but to be honest, they had great pricing out of the gate, and no need to haggle.   Very fair!  Better than fair probably.

After the sale i wanted to add accessories, and without having to ask i was offered a discount on anything i wanted!   Andy in PARTS was great. Knows his stuff, and told me he would ship my parts to me because i am not local.  Called back in later and spoke to him again and same great service!  OH!  And they have tons of selection!  Anything you need they have it!  I'm lucky my wife was with me or i would have shopped and picked up more great accessories!  Helmets gloves jackets and anything else you can think of.  A little place that's bigger inside than you may think.

Kevin the Finance guy was so quick and really painless.  Even my wife was surprised at how fast he got us through the process.

What can i say?  I wish i lived closer because the Service dept has a great rep as well.  I may even take a trip for service, just because if they do that half as well as the sales end i'll be happy!

Great place to do business.  Highly recommend!</Text>< Response>

<text>I'm on my third Simi Valley Cycles motorcycle.  I ride 100 miles just to get to them - this last time in the rain.  They are amazing with service - even recalls they'll exchange emails and attached documents and let me know when the parts come in.  And if I'm on my 3rd bike with them, they also will work with you as much if not more than the others on the bottom line.  Living in Santa Barbara County, I don't travel as far as Simi just because I like to ride - I have yet to find anyone to touch Simi with professionalism, responsiveness and courtesy.  And this last time I was there, Dewayne gave me the chance to ride a bike I've been lusting over - the Yamaha FZ10, which nobody in Santa Barbara County would do.  Why wouldn't I come back?  I can even visit my friends at the Rock Store on the same trip!  I have some local friends who also feel the same way, willing to make that trip to visit Simi and Dewayne's crew.</text><time>1494181960559< /time><rating>5</rating><pics>None<//pics>< username>

I took my 2013 Triumph Daytona 675R to the shop for mechanical work. Their mechanic did a great job on the bike, and just about everybody in the back are super cool and easy going. SVC is a great place to bring your speedy two wheels rocket in for mechanical works or basic maintenance. Overall, this is a great motorcycle shop with great people.< /review>

< review>
New triumph owner here!! Thanks to Rick in sales. I have always wanted a Bonneville since my dad had one when I was growing up. Now I have one. Just wanted to say this guy is super knowledgeably about Triumphs. I mean I went into a couple other dealers Like Cal coast and To powersports. And i went with SVC because of their down to earth feel, and I think this is how the shop would be back in the 70's. Really laid back, but still very informative. Don't go anywhere else. Plus parts department is quick and very helpfull, and just all around I love this place. Thanks again!!!!< /review>

Paul was great as the salesman.  He answered all questions and suggested options to suit me.  Kevin was efficient in handling the paperwork, smoothly.  Chris reassurred me that the maintainance on the Rocket would be top notch, and introduced me to the service dept. crew.  Andy was very helpful in the parts dept. helping me order a service manual, cover.  Mike, also in parts, explained the operation of the two way bule tooth communication units.  Dwane gave me a great deal on my old Maxium 1100.<//review>

“I've purchased a Triumph Sprint ST, Tiger 1050 and an FJ-09 from Simi Valley. Duane and crew are straight shooters and I'm really happy with the OTD prices. My Yamaha FJ09 purchase had me in and out in 20 minutes. Wow. Never had that experience before. I'd trust and recommend them to anyone - and I'm coming from 70 miles away.  I also watched the first service of my Fj09 occur, and it was very comprehensive and thorough.  My experience is quite different from some of the negative comments I've seen.”<//text>

Showroom is acceptable and the salesman are cool (+2 stars). Service department is incompetent. The shop is dirty and disorganized. The few technicians they have are slow and inexperienced. They had my bike for a month and a half when the mechanic finally got around to diagnose the bike that i took there for a malfunctioning taillight. Then he calls me and tells me there is an electrical problem he didn't think he could fix and to come pick up my bike. Ok. I go pick it up and have a bill totaling $612 for parts and labor on spark plugs, air filter, and oil change. And the bike stays locked up until I pay. Ok so i got burned..but then i get the bike home and now it has a gas leak. Go figure (-3 stars).
My advice, go there if you want but spend the time to check out some other shops. I had to drive a little out of my way but found a place that was far more professional. My bike was up and running in 3 weeks and haven't had a problem since.

SVC is by far the worst motorcycle dealer in Ventura County, if not all of Southern California.  Their parts department does not carry a large inventory insuring that their customers will have to wait.  Their service department is staffed by young, untrained technicians who perform shoddy work.

I purchased a motorcycle from them in 2001.  Two years later it developed an intermittent missing problem and I brought it to them under warranty.  They tried on three separate occasions to find and repair the problem and couldn't.  They ended up giving the bike back to me un-repaired.  I then brought the bike to a competing dealer who diagnosed and located the problem in 10 minutes, ordered the part and returned my motorcycle in three days.

While SVC had my motorcycle the last time under warranty, they kept it for 4 weeks, broke my carburetor float bowls, glued them back together with epoxy, replaced defective parts with used ones, stored it outside in the rain (customary for them) and they returned the motorcycle to me completely filthy and corroded.  They refused to repair the damage they had caused or even detail the bike.

I highly recommend that you avoid Simi Valley Cycles.</Text>

<review>I had a serious financial loss with a pay cut at work. A couple years back and started saving money. I started looking into motorcycles for better gas mileage. I saw that the Drz 400 got around 65 MPG!!!! So I shopped around alot and found that Simi Cycles had really good prices. And being the closest to me. I went in and wound up getting the DRZ. Now i am saving money on my gas... ALOT. But the major kicker is that I got qualified to not pay any interest for five years on my loan. I am so glad that I went in and bought this bike. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend this shop to other riders. Hope to see any of you out there. Or maybe at the parts counter!<//review><Rating>5</Rating><response>None<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

Last visit, my fiancee and I took a friend from out of town to Pedro's. The friendly woman at the counter suggested we try the Molcajete for four. The Molcajete sits in a volcanic bowl that is a bubbling aromatic mass of carne asada, chicken and pork, carrots, radishes, serrano peppers, onion, and topped with sliced avocado and cheese, and grilled shrimp. It was phenomenal. It's almost like stewed meat, but spicier and more meaty. My friend from out of town was so impressed. It was the first time he's ever been to Dixon. Our meal for the three of us, including sodas, totaled 26$ and we had leftovers to spare! Would totally be down to go 2-3 more times before Xmas break ends 👌< /Text>

<Review>Mexican style dishes served with their fresh homemade corn tortillas.They make a flavorful cafe de olla (cinnamon coffee). This little gem has plenty of seating but recommend you take a picture of the menu then sit down wherever you want, the server will come and take your order. They do not have menu's also bring Cash as it is a cash only restaurant. Sorry, ate my meal and forgot to  take a picture of my order, next time :)< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5BCTtFURJil_fMo_uDUn002k1ZNI0rVwskC4q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Pedro's cocina is the One of the best Mexican Restaurants in Dixon.
Everything: From Salsas to Coffee is made to high standards, place is decent size service is fast knowing they make their plates as they get orders it takes time to make a dish as order.
Overall is worth every penny.</Review>

< Review>
These people are very unorganized, had to tell my order 3 times, went to get my food at 740 and headed out of there at 850 PM after the lady taking the orders didnt write down my order. The owner showed up and a bunch of lies were told to him about how busy they were.not busy at all while I was there. Definitely not going there again at all,  this was NOT the first time this has happened.<//Review>

The food here is AMAZING. Pedro is always so kind to us and has always made our children feel welcome. I recommend the asada tacos and the carnitas tacos, but really you can't go wrong with anything you order.. we look forward to going back soon! Amazing flavors, authentic, homemade, and perfectly portioned for a super reasonable price.</text>

The Fat Man does not lie.  After reading his review, we gave Pedro's Cocino a try.  Indeed, the food is excellent.   Authentic Mexican and Central American cuisine with exceptional flavor at reasonable prices.
House made tortillas, pupusas, tamales, etc.<//Text>

<review>We ate here this afternoon and had a great meal. The al pastor tacos are fantastic and the barbacoa tacos equally so. Service was great and prices reasonable, although bring cash, they don't do cards (yet). It's cash only but well worth it for some of the best Mexican food in the area.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

Dixon has a lot of Mexican restaurants but most of them lack that Mexican flavor and texture. Pedro’s cocina has that. I’ve drove by it but never bothered to come check it out because I’m super picky about Mexican food (I always prefer my moms). I’ve tried there tacos and their shrimp and oh my god it’s delicious. The staff is also very kind which is major plus. Please give this place a try and you will not regret it.

BUT PLEASE BRING CASH. THEY DONT ACCEPT CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS YET.<//review><user_id>105748771963909793319<//user_id><Rating>5< /Rating>< Name>

Okay.... I consider myself a bit of a Mexican cuisine fanatic/connoisseur. We were in Dixon, CA (we certainly don’t come to Dixon much) but had to pick up furniture. We were hungry and turned to Yelp to find somewhere local with good reviews.

At first we thought the directions were a mistake. It’s adjoining to a food mart/gas station building. Apprehensive my husband got out to inspect the restaurant. He quickly waved us in...

Pedro is who greeted us. Such a nice man. He was engaging with our son & helped us order. I got El Pastor tacos & Carnitas. He brought out things for us to sample like pickled onions with pineapple. Needless to say these were the best tacos I’ve ever had (yes ever).

My husband went with Pedro’s recommendation and had Sandwich full of marinated meat, veggies and avocado. (I can’t remember the name).
We were stuffed and enjoyed the food so much I purchased some El Pastor & Carnitas to take home.

Turns out Pedro is a fixture in Dixon and has a following of loyal customers. This is where the locals go for amazing Mexican food. We got Pedro’s card and he does event cratering too.

We we’ll definitely go out of our way to eat here and refer our friends.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad customer service, they take too long to prepare the food, I returned all the time thinking that for the next visit it might be different, but today unfortunately it was the straw that I spilled into the glass, I had to wait almost 2 hours for my food to go and the owner of the restaurant did not offer me an apology, I will definitely not return.

Muy mal servicio al cliente,  tardan demasiado en preparar la comida, regresaba todo el tiempo pensando que  para la siguiente visita talvez seria diferente, pero hoy desafortunadamente fue la gota que derramo al vaso, tuve que esperar casi 2 horas por mi comida para llevar y el dueño del restaurante ni una disculpa me ofrecio, definitivamente no regresare.</Text>

Great experience buying the mattress.  Keshif is manager, vy professional & helpful.  Made me feel like I was in a safe & happy place.... with 0 pressure!  Amazing
Jared, the young man at Larkspur location is also wonderful; he answered a Q I've always had re buying mattresses from a bed store:
"Why do mattresses feel great when u try briefly in store, then when u buy one of your own it feels entirely different??"
He let me finish, nodded & smiled.  And w/o missing a beat calmly replied, "Because the ones on display in the store are all broken in.   It takes awhile, that's why we give 120 nights.  It will eventually feel just like the one u fell in love with..."

Open mouth, insert foot.   Why didn't I think of that!
I am a 51 yr old service elevator mechanic.  Of course it has to break in.

Out of the mouth of babes!</review>

< review>
Buying a mattress at Mattress Firm was a completely positive experience. In fact, it was fun!
The service was fantastic. Even though the sales staff were working with other clients who were there before us, we got immediate attention. We were given a quick explanation on which mattresses to test first as well as a personal pillow and pillow napkin to use while we moved from bed to bed.
Rene was the sales associate who worked with us and she was a complete pro. She knows her mattresses !  Beyond her knowledge in the mattress arena, Rene has a great sense of humor and easily relates to people and their concerns, needs and budget.
If I owned a store, I would love to have Rene work for me 👍👍< /review>

<rating>2< /rating><review>I am disappointed with the service my husband and I received from this store. The first time we made an appointment, we actually visited the Mattress Firm in Larkspur, and it was a total waste of time. They lectured us about some sort of monopoly, and when I requested info about a specific brand I was looking for, I was told they were out of stock. However, when we went to visit Mattress Firm in San Rafael, the brand had several mattresses featured prominently on the floor of the store. Aren't all stores the same? Apparently not. We found what we needed, and we even opted to purchase pillows as part of our order. We also acquired the "adjustable base", a bedspring that allowed the lifting of the head or legs. We went all in. We chose the mattress, the salesperson was helpful and gave us good discounts. However, when the delivery people arrived a few days later to our home, they brought a totally different mattress! A mistake was clearly made when the order was placed. The same people had to come back, take the mattress away, and deliver the correct one. Pain in the butt! On top of it all, the delivery staff left this "Review Paper", asking us to give them an 8 if we were unsatisfied with their service or a 10 if we were satisfied. What kind of trick is this? It was outright insulting. The problem did not stop there, we waited almost two weeks for our pillows to arrive, and when they finally did... boom! It was only ONE pillow. Again, a mistake had been made while placing the order, and we only received the one. We had to contact the salesperson again, and eventually place another order. More waiting, more annoyance. In the meantime, whenever we reached out to ask for help, no one was able to assist us, they kept pushing responsibility for recompense back onto the helpful sales associate. That's a supremely suboptimal service there and a strongly unsatisfied customer here.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1600029205267, 'text': 'Tatiana,\n\nI am very sorry about your experience at Mattress Firm.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>I called for a shipping question, was told that the mattress I was looking at online was out of stock, and was asked to come into the store. I was honestly annoyed. I wanted to avoid human interaction. But alas, I went. I’m really glad I did. The manager asked maybe 4 questions and was able to show me 3 mattresses immediately that I tried and loved. He was able to stick in my price range and find me a mattress that I wouldn’t have been able to sus out online. I was able to pick the exact day I want delivery and am really excited to try it all out. Anthony at the San Rafael CA mattress firm store is great! Highly recommend.<//text>< name>

<review>Actually shocked at how great the entire experience was.  Ordered a low profile queen box spring at 2:30 yesterday.  Got a delivery window between 12:15-2:15 today.  Was delivered at 12:10.  Delivery guys were fast, courteous, and most helpful.

Had requested delivery to the front door and pickup of old box spring.  Took less than 5 minutes. No charge.

Item was same price  at Macy’s, but it would have been $100 more for delivery and pickup.

Bravo, MattressFirm!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

We worked with Anthony and had a great experience! We didnt have a ton of time- and he quickly fogured out what we needed and got us into options. This is the second mattress I have bought at the San Rafael Mattress Firm and both times the customer associates have been fantastic.<//Review>

The store manager Anthony was very helpful when I came in to the store to make a mattress exchange.  He listened to the issues I had with my original mattress purchase and helped me find a better choice based on the features that were important to me in a mattress.   Shopping for a mattress is a big decision and can be overwhelming when trying to choose the best one given so many choices and prices.  Anthony went out of his way to make sure that my shopping experience went smoothly and that all my concerns were addressed.</Text>

We purchased a mattress from Mattress Firm last weekend. We were impressed by the organization of the store, it's cleanliness, and the variety of mattress options available. Ed Phillips was our sales associate and he made the experience enjoyable. He patiently waited while we tried several mattresses, encouraging us to take our time and compare. He also asked about our sleeping habits and what we were looking for in a bed. We left the store feeling confident we'd made the right decision. Our mattress was delivered yesterday and we both had a great night's sleep. I'd highly recommend Mattress Firm and Ed!</text>

< Review>
Great experience at Mattress Firm, San Rafael with Brent! I’ve been toiling over a thousand mattress videos and Consumer’s Report. Incredibly confusing and exhausting.
It was amazing to lay on all the beds and have Brent with years of experience helping us through this process. We had a good laugh and a great experience. We felt very comfortable with the sanitization of the mattresses in between clients.
Delivery and haul out of our old bed happened the very next day!
We also had a mistaken base delivery. Brent literally had it exchanged the same day!<//Review>

The service provided by the Manager, Ed and his associate Brent has been outstanding. Knowledgeable, articulate, helpful, and pleasant are the qualities that allowed for a successful purchase of a mattress that I believe will suit me for years to come. I am still in the trial period, and believe that if I were ultimately unhappy with my bed, these folks will work with me to find the right one. A big plus are the delivery guys: they kept me informed of the delivery time with numerous texts and a phone call, arrived on time, were professional and friendly, respected my personal space by wearing shoe booties, took away my old mattress and set up the new one with ease, and even put on the additional dust cover. Out of the several local mattress sellers, Mattress Firm San Rafael stands out.<//text>

Shopping for the right mattress for me is daunting and confusing.  After being bombarded with Mattress advertisements on TV, Internet, and radio, I decided to “just do it.”  I was looking forward to having an improved quality of sleep, and was hopeful a new mattress, with all of the new technology, would help.  I had adequately researched options, but without laying on the mattress, it is futile.  My wife and I apprehensively entered the Mattress Firm store in San Rafael, and was quickly overwhelmed by too many options.  Ed Phillips greeted us and asked if he could suggest a process that efficiently narrowed the options.  I was skeptical.  Not only was Ed a good listener, he navigated both of our wants, provided several options, and effectively helped us cultivate our ultimate decision.  He was extremely knowledgeable and made the decision process from start to finish awesome.  Oh and Ed’s associate, Brent, offered valuable insight as well.  Thanks again and “goodnight!”< /review>

Brett L was so helpful today! I was unsure of whether I would find something I loved, but he helped me to narrow down my top mattresses and make an educated decision. He even helped me out with choosing an adjustable base and matched a coupon I had left at home! The process was a breeze and he made it a positive one. Will recommend him to friends!</text>

Bought matress on sale and box sping included.  After living with it, needed to exchange box spring for a 5 inch vs the 9 inch one I had. It is being exchanged without problems. To be delivered next week.<//review>

<review>Called ahead to plan our visit to be quick due to COVID-19. Brent was super helpful and friendly. Once there we were shown the products we were interested in, quickly went over pricing, financing, and timeline, saying we'd call back to finalize the next day. He gave no pressure to commit on the spot. Place was clean with only one other couple i side and plenty of safety precautions (towel for head, hand sanitizer, masks). Finalizing the purchase over the phone was easy, and team members coordinated to make sure we had the correct deal agreed to in-person though it was Brent's day off. Delivery is next week so can't speak to that aspect of things.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Fantastic experience all around -
from the first order by phone with Janet (now in their Novato store) to the excellent care I received from Brent when I went in to see the adjustable base and try it out, to the super friendly responses I received from my many phone calls to Brent, Ed and others!

It was truly a delightful experience going to the store and interacting with such personable and kind employees who really care about their customers!!

Brent really went the extra mile in helping out with my special requests!

I would highly recommend the San Rafael Mattress Firm.

The delivery experience was swift and  smooth and the delivery people even wore booties to protect my carpets!

And....  the mattress!!!!
FABULOUS!  I got the Purple 4 with the adjustable base.  Needed a bit of "breaking in" per their helpful e-mail suggestions I received the very next morning!
Did the trick!

LOVE my new mattress and MATTRESS FIRM  - SAN RAFAEL!!<//text>< pics>

My partner and I went in to check out our options and to see if we REALLY needed a new bed or whether we THOUGHT we needed a new bed. Having a bad back, it only took laying on one mattress to figure out that yes, a new mattress was needed. Ed helped explain all the different options and encouraged us to take our time and really make sure we found the right bed. While it could’ve been easy to just point us to the most-expensive-latest-and-greatest-space-age mattress, he showed us the pros and cons behind everything. We ultimately went home with a great traditional mattress and after our first night sleeping on it we woke up quite happy with our purchase.<//review>

We have had same mattress for 12 years and were new to all the new mattress technology out there. Brent took us through all the different kinds of beds and brands, explained the technology behind each, allowed us to lay on each bed, helped us determine if we were a plush, medium or firm and made it fun. We found a GREAT mattress with Brent and it's being delivered tomorrow - next day after the sale. Highly recommend this store and working with Brent.</review>< pics>

If I can avoid online commerce and support local business’s I do!

Mattress Firm came in very competitively against online pricing, it gave me the option to support a local business and working class people in my community!

Thx Olivia, and Mattress Firm!</Review>

Wow .. we went in to return a mattress we purchased 2 years ago and were greeted with outstanding customer service. Sean and Elliott went out of their way to accommodate us. We were given a new and better mattress (upgraded) and it was delivered the very next day.
We really were so very impressed with the way they handled everything and made sure that we were happy. We will definitely be returning customers. Thank you Sean .. Thanks Elliott for your 5 Star customer service.</Review>

We knew what we wanted (Tempur-pedic) and there were several vendors to choose from but what made the difference was the service and responsiveness of Ed Phillips, the store manager. He guided us and patiently answered all of our questions with no pressure.  He made it easy and a pleasant experience. Excited to have a new and comfortable bed after a long time!< /review>< pictures>

My experience with working with Lou at the San Rafael mattress firm was excellent.

I highly recommend him.

I went through quite a saga trying to find the right bed for my bad back.

I went to virtually every mattress store in San Rafael, tried many different types of beds and settled on working with Lou at Matress Firm.

Lou was very helpful knowledgeable and non-pushy. The first bed I purchased turned out not to be optimal for by bad back.

He easily allowed me to return it and select one that did work for me.

I was quite impressed his your level of service and non-pushy approach.</text>

<Text>Very helpful staff. We haven't bought a bed in 20 years, and a lot has changed. The salesman was patient, informative and did not hover. He let us spend time to discuss things without making us feel abandoned.< /Text>< userid>

Moved to CA from GA ... left the 20-year old mattress and needed a replacement.
Paul Lambres was great in answering our questions and putting a package together to meet our needs – and no high pressure to buy.
Mattress Firm delivery stayed on schedule during the middle of the NorCal PGE PSPS!</review>

My husband and I needed a new bed and went to Sleep Train in San Rafael. Our sales person was John Martignoli. John is knowledgeable and patient. He made some suggestions but wasn't pushy. He let us take our time in choosing our bed. When we made a mistake in our choice of bed, he was ready and willing to help resolve the issue. This is not the first bed we bought from Sleep Train and it won't be the last.</Text>

I ordered sheets in a sleep train store to be shipped to my home as you do not carry the cal king split sheets in the store, no only did the go to the store (no close to where I live) but the wrong color. I called customer service and had sheets mailed to me, but still received the wrong color.<//text>

If you’re looking for a new mattress and not sure what you need, go and see Diamonds at Mattress Firm. She so welcoming and helped educate us on the best options to match everything we need. Thank you, Diamond!!<//review>

I normally feel uncomfortable in the nail salon because the nail ladies are never nice or don’t talk to you but my nail lady was very nice and she talk to me and they also have wax services and I expressed to her that it was my first time getting a wax and she was super pleasant to talk to, she knew what she was doing & my overall experience here was delightful.<//Review>< response>

i asked for a full set and not only did they not have the color i wanted but also used dirty brushes and files. my nails have lint and dirt mixed with the clear coat. and the nails are crooked. didn’t get what i want at all and the price was too much. i legit want to cry with how bad they came out. it was so bad.<//text>

<time>1528919671335</time><rating>5<//rating><review>I had a great experience. Went in on a weekday afternoon when they weren't busy. Got a gel manicure. The lady who did it was very gentle, did not cut me or hurt in any way, and did a very neat job. My hands are working nonstop and constantly being washed and sanitized, but this gel looked nice for about 2 weeks before it started to peel. So I would definitely go back.< /review>< pics>

They offer you wine while you're getting your nails done! I love how they decorated their shop! I wish they took appointments... They are always super busy on the weekends.</text>

<text>Vivian is the worst nail tech I’ve ever had, Place overall is good And I would recommend it but I would avoid the young girl Vivian She charges more than any other nail tech for a full set and will also do the worst job than any other nail tech there. I’ve had good experiences with every other lady there but she charged me double and gave me a crooked set of nails she even insulted me about my scars on my hands and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. She sits second row on the left, be careful.<//text>< pics>

So bummed because this place is so nice. I've been 3 times and all 3 times I left not satisfied. It's super pricey and it's not good quality work. I tried different nail techs thinking it was just "that one" and another would be better. Nope.<//review>

Very nice beautiful presentation. They offer a variety of relaxing pedicures. There is a sign that says no kids allowed though. They say they offer complimentary drinks on Yelp but they didn't offer me and my friend any. I got a nice pedicure. I would say they did a good job. Not a big waiting area only seats about 5<//review>

I seriously love this place so much. Their service is incredible and they are all so nice. I'm definitely making this place my main nail place! It's so pretty inside and the whole design of the place is so fancy and aesthetic. They did my nails so well and all my friends are jealous.<//Review>

<user_name>Yonnie Bu< /user_name><review>I went in and everything was fine, a bit of a wait but I didn't have much to do that day. The place was nice.... up until I went in to get a pedicure and the woman that was helping me made my toe bleed. Not just a little new nick but like a good amount of blood. Accidents happen though and I wasn't going to bite her head off over an accident. She poured some weird stuff on it and it eventually stopped. I go to pay and they charge me $25 ( pedicure and design but she never told me design prices. I thought she was doing it for free shipping nice she messed up) so I pay it and leave. You would think she wouldn't charge me for a design since she cut me. Not even 10 minutes later after I leave my toe starts bleeding profusely again. Was the stuff she put on made to stop the bleeding until I left? On top of that the nail polish only stayed on for about 2 days.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

Liza and van are good not sure what the sterilization. They are also always really busy. My gel nails tend to chip often almost all the time. They don't really seem to care that they have a problem with chippy Nails myself and my two other sisters go there reasonably priced but I feel like they do a sloppy job sometimes.< /text>

<review>Waited at least half an hour to do my nails done and loved them but the fact that i waited so long was unnecessary when i wanted to leave they told me to stay because the other lady was about to finish anyways didn't last long in my right hand my ring finger broke all of sudden i didnt do anything to make it break I'm super careful about when i get my nails done.< /review>< pictures>

Terrible, I got a fill here because my place had a two hour wait and they used Kiara Sky dipping powder, which is only 11$ for a tub of it, I woke up in bed not even a full day later with my nail in half because of the supplies they use. They charge you based on your appearance. They over charged me and my nail fell off the next day I will never come here again!!</text>

It was my first time getting a gel manicure and I had read that although handy, gel manicures can be damaging to our nails and that professional removal is best. When I got there the place was packed but they were nice enough to see me right away since all I wanted was to take off the gel. The fact that they were willing to help me immediately rather than make me wait was amazing and I really appreciate it! This will be my new go to nail salon!< /Review>

This place is actually really nice inside. Not your average nail salon, I paid $75 for my pedicure and gel dip powder . Kinda pricey but they did a great job, they offered me beer,water or wine with my service which was also a plus . Over all a great experience, no complaints< /review>

They also work really quickly and I always love my nails. However, the nail tech who’s been doing my nails the last couple times has the worst attitude. If she didn’t do such a good job I would have walked out halfway thru the first time. Her attitude gets worse when I say I don’t want gel smh< /text><time>1533179999826< /time>< user_id>

<Review>I do love this place , I came in with the most botched acrylics ever  after a lady took them  off  which tore more then  half of my nail off from 2 fingers which was from another salon  , True Nails fixed it  when I wanted a gel manicure ,and were so extremely nice , it is pricey ,  but I’ve definitely learned don’t go to cheaper places or else they do horrible service in my opinion, the service you get hear is not like any other they took their time with everything , every bit of the nail process they put good brands on , after my gel nails they put some type of cuticle oil but wooow it was so beautiful what the oil came in and it smelled amazing !  Also the only reason for the 4 stars is because my gel polish started turning a different color ? I had got a light pick and in the middle of my nail it’s turning white ??  Although that won’t stop me from coming here because they give you amazing service (: Just giving you guys my experience hope this helped (:</Review>< pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I got a full set of hard gel nails. As a nail tech myself I know the application was perfect to where the nails didnt lift or break. My set lasted me almost 3 weeks until I chose to take them off. I paid $58 for my service. They offer a complimentary drink with anu service. One thing i disliked was that the nails were filed carelessly and some nails looked crooked or needed more filing.<//review>< user_id>

After my regular nail tech cancelled on me last minute, I Google searched for other shops as I was attending a special event and needed nails and pedi ASAP. This place is not too far from the preserves and right off the 60 fwy Euclid Ave. exit. They accept walk-ins and although I arrived 15 minutes after their 9:30am open time, the place was packed! I waited about 10-15 minutes and got a full set and spa pedi.

Pros: Fast, clean, professional, takes walk-ins, no children allowed unless they are getting services done on them (makes for a quiet, true spa experience)

Cons: Cash tip only, pricey, and for those with small children, they aren't allowed to maintain a spa atmosphere (yes, I do have children, but for me it's a PRO as it gives me an excuse to pamper myself alone) there are plenty of nail salons that allow children

I enjoyed my time there and I'll be back again!< /Review>

I have been going to a place in OC for years. Never found a place locally I liked and nails wouldn't lift or break. I tried true nails when they opened,  love them.  My nails don't lift or break. I can go 3 weeks on a fill. And they even helped me try new things and colors.  I always did black french manicure now I am doing all sorts or colors!  Big step for me lol. Love them won't go anywhere else.  Took my daughter and her friend to he pedicures and they were so nice and sweet to them.<//Review>

<text>The place has a modern atmosphere which is cool other than that it’s expensive your basically over paying for the nails & drink they offer you plus their rude snobby attitude is uncomfortable (speaking their language while staring at you like their speaking about you) didn’t like that about them 1 visit did it for me< /text>< Pictures>

Had the worst pedicure done by Tina, i believe that was her name. She couldn't speak english but she knew enough to ask me if i wanted to get more services done, to make more money off me. Very unsatisfied..never coming back. Expensive pedicure, she cracked my real toenails, nail polish came off after 3 days< /Text>

<Text>Quick and easy oil change very nice people here. Sometimes we go just for an oil change and there is so much up selling that you never want to go back. Not this place, they ask if you would like to go over suggestions and no pressure if not. Great place and they are super happy to help!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I loved the concept of drive through. You just sit in the car and continue your work or phone conversation. No reservations hassle, and not much wait since it is quick in and quick out.

Make sure you call them to get the latest coupon, they will automatically text you after conversation. Also they have coupons on their website.</text>

These guys are awesome! It's the only place I trust to have my wife go and get her oil changed and know they aren't going to sell her a bunch of unnecessary services. Highly recommended.<//text>

<Review>Friendly, fast service. They send a lot of coupons which helps make the prices more reasonable. I got new windshield wipers and I didn't realize how much I needed them!< /Review>< Pics>

Quick, friendly service! Being a new customer, the mechanic explained every step of the process and made sure I was involved during every decision. I've never felt more at ease, reassured and confident within 15 minutes time. Definitely recommend!< /text>

Awesome crew. They got the oil changed quickly and were not pushy re: suggested maintenance recommendations. They discovered an issue advised I reach to my regular mechanic. I got the problem diagnosed and fixed by my mechanic within 2 days! I believe the service advisor was Jacob or Justin. He was very polite, clear and just awesome customer service.  Would recommend this location with a 5 star rating. Great job!< /text>

DO NOT GO HERE. They left a tool under my hood when they changed my oil that popped my radiator and cost me $1000. Despite being the only place to EVER touch my car (which they proved looking it up on CARFAX), and the tool being the brand they use, they’ve denied responsibility. They seemed nice and cheap... turns out they’re just dishonest. Again, DO NOT GO HERE.</Text>

Once you get into the bay they offer several different packages and let you choose. You can see everything on the screen so you know they aren't cheating you. Great customer service with out being cheesy.

I usually avoid chain mechanics because there are so many small garage owners I try to support them...

In this case I had seen their 15 minute oil change sign every day and on my way into work my oil light and engine light came on so it was the perfect time to give em a try and I'm glad I did.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

WOW. Wish I could give these guys 6 stars. Pulled in for an oil change and a few other replacement items. The drive-thru style service is incredibly convenient, I didn't have to leave my car at all. The staff is friendly and super helpful, and guided me through everything in very easy-to-understand terms.

I told them what my car needed and the boys went straight to work. They also ran diagnostics on the car to confirm that everything else was in good shape, and restored the pressure in my tires (all of that was included with the oil change service). For each maintenance item, the technician presented all the options I could choose from (e.g. oil types, wiper blade models), along with Honda recommendations. He didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need, and didn't try to push the more expensive options if I didn't want them. The prices were much cheaper than most other auto shops I've been to, and since I got several things done on the car, they gave me an additional discount off the total price as well!

The service was incredibly fast -- I was in and out in about 20 minutes! I am beyond impressed with every aspect of my experience today. I'll definitely be coming back to this Valvoline location for future maintenance/repairs!</review>

I had been putting off getting an oil change bc it didn't sound like an ideal way to spend my lunch break, but the crew at Valvoline was super nice and fast! I felt that they did a very thorough job checking out my car (tire pressure, lights, etc.) and that they also got the oil change done very quickly. I appreciated that they took the time to educate me about my options without being pushy at all. Overall, everyone was very friendly and professional and I'll definitely be going back and recommending them to all my co-workers because we work right next door.</review>

<Text>I arrived a little after 6 p.m. the guy seemed to make a game seen how fast they can get people in and out. They were fast, little over 5 minutes with me.
BUT ... they did not feel the windshield fluid reservoir and left the cap of the valve stem on a tire. Obviously, a lot of playing is going on there.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Oil change was fine. But then a guy took out the cabin filter and told me it was $49 to replace it (no charge for service). When I asked if I bought one elsewhere and did it myself, he looked me right in the eye and lied that it would be the same price. I took him at his word and had him change it. Then I go home and look it up. For my vehicle specifically the filter was $15 at AutoZone.
Now you may have fooled me once, but you've lost my business forever. I will never return here.< /text><Response>{'time': 1463583627306, 'text': 'Hello Carol,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your review with us.

They are quick. It's my first time there and it's like a show for me. Because it's a drive thru, I don't need to get off at all. They even taught me how to reset the oil change reminder  light. Lol. Coupon on website!<//Text>

<review>Went in for an oil change, which went well. Then they told me that I needed to change my air filter. I was hesitant, but agreed to it. A week later my check engine light came on and my OBD2 Scanner gave me the P0101 code. I had it checked out and my air filter was installed incorrectly.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Website clearly states that they open at 7:30am which is the reason I chose this place so I could go before work and I show up at 7:40 and the team regretfully informs me that the opener is not there on time to open. I stayed for 15 more minutes until I had to leave to make it to work while the team just sat outside.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dbf99fd23c5147:0xb044b5c5f4440e9d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Interesting and disappointing experience at Photoworks.  My wife and I accompanied my daughter to Photoworks to drop off her 35mm film and noticed two framed black and white photographs on the wall, one depicting a smiling Asian couple holding hands while walking and the other depicting an African American male violently striking an African American young lady in the face! See attached photo for context.

My wife pointed these two dramatically contrasting framed photos to me and we immediately addressed our alarm and concerns to the first available store representative. To our surprise, store representative said she had nothing to do with the selection and display of the photos. We then asked three staff members  for the manager on duty and one of the staff members stated he was the owner, so we addressed our concerns with him about the juxtaposition of the two photos and the violent stereotypical message reinforcing African American male violence and domestic violence.

The owner said he was just made aware of the frame photos on the wall 5 minutes ago (4 minutes too late in my opinion) and the photos were left over from an exhibit and he would immediately remedy the situation by removing the offensive photo from the wall.

We left Photoworks with the assurance the offensive black and white frame photo would be removed from the wall and hopefully from their store.

My daughter who just completed her freshman year at the local university with a 3.5 GPA was disturbed and surprised about our experience as she has had good experiences at Photoworks. As a result, I am giving this location 2 stars.

Good teaching movement for my gay, smart, and beautiful African American daughter in one of the most Liberal cities and communities  (Castro District) in the world in preparation for Pride week.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt2b_qB20DxmiK_bBaoOQlVWfMjh2qFJWPxExU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUy7f7xNaGSf-2M5vVp9Lgckf-0PqDOGmC0Kzg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1528133094094, 'text': 'Hi Derek, unfortunately these images were mounted before we reviewed them for an upcoming show we’re sponsoring.

The best scanning quality still very low, if you can compare to other places, I think they need to invest in better equipment (for 120mm), for 35mm scanning resolution they would provide is actually higher - which makes no sense to me.</text>

This is a great local camera store to get film developed at. They are super prompt and friendly. I’ve also gotten art framed here for really reasonable prices and good work!</Review>

Friendly and attentive staff, knowledgeable and willing to help.
Service is fast and professional. The building is beautiful, clean and aesthetically pleasing.
Only issue is parking, a bit confusing and there's rarely any good spots so you might have to do some extra walking.< /text>

<Review>I ordered 2 rolls of deluxe JPG scan in the store, they sent me the files with standard scans which have much lower resolution. I called the store to double check, and eventually Dave called me and said he was 1000% sure they gave me the deluxe scan. I downloaded all files again, and they were indeed standard scans. So I called the store again, and this time Dave said he checked the wrong order, and they did send me standard scans... and Dave agreed that he would be able to do a full refund of 2 rolls of deluxe JPG scan.

I didn't received the refund when I went to the store to pickup films after a week. So I asked a staff to double check whether or not there was a refund on my last order. She said yes, and saying that it would take a long time since it was electronic refund.

After waiting for another 3 weeks, I still didn't get the refund. So I called the store, and I was told that there was no refund processed on my last order at all...

I don't know how Dave, the owner of Photoworks and one of their staff could cheat their customer like this.< /Review>< rating>

It doesn't get better than this for film development in San Francisco. Their prices and turnover times are great and simple to understand. And especially for students, we get prices that are easier on our limited wallets.<//Text>

I popped in on a Saturday afternoon asking one of the five employees if they had a price sheet for prints.
The fifty year old employee acted like he couldn't be bothered, acted as if my question was completely irrational.  I don't always like to go online and search for pricing; I prefer to have a pricing sheet in a folder myself or for when I am meeting with a client, he or she can see for themselves.

Coming from NY, I'm not asking for a warm welcome mat when I enter, but I know a professional when I interact with one.
It's a bit pathetic when I have to call out someone (who is much older) on their lack of professionalism.  I like to support independently owned stores, but this is one of those snotty establishments where I would be fine if they had to move out due to high rent, and a bank branch took its place, at least it would be more well served.<//Review>

I ended up dropping 2 rolls of film off to get developed and their lowest tier of scanning. You can pick up the negatives if you want, but I told them to discard them. While inside I got 2 fujicolor superia 400 rolls. In the end with the student discount it was $45.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Extremely grateful for Photoworks services and their commitment to serving SF community. I work for a homeless service provider in the Tenderloin District, and Photoworks has supported us in our fundraising efforts over the years. Not only do they do excellent photo work, but they're genuinely invested in their community. Super grateful for all they do!< /text>

I was in the store today for a service that i am not so sure about, I want to know the price and details of the work. The front desk staff wasn't really passionate to help, was not willing to offer help. I drove all the way to the store to ask specific question and want to make sure my stuff get done right, but I didn't feel he wanted to help at all. Disappointed.<//review>

I've been going here for a year, and despite the prices, I've been satisfied by their efficient service. The women that take my order seem to be really passionate about photography and are always happy to inform you if you have a question.

If you're in a rush to get film developed, just get the film scanned and emailed. It can go up to $20 for high quality scans with negatives.

Definitely one of my go-to places.<//Text>

I have been using this lab for over two years, having processed over thirty rolls of film with them.  I do BW film almost exclusively, usually Kodak tri-x.  First the good.  The development and scanning has been good and the negatives come back clean. Now for the bad. I sent in two rolls which they processed and returned with CD of scans and the CD was blank.  On another occasion I sent them two rolls which were processed and scanned to CD but they sent someone else's film back with their scans on the CD and my film also went to some other person.  Depending on how busy they are turnaround can be up to two weeks despite my using UPS and Fedex for mailing.  They eventually get it right but I would say customer service is poor and a hassle and they don't take time to listen to complaints but just cut any phone conversation short.  I am seriously thinking of giving up on my love for BW film and going back to digital.  It just isn't worth it.
Follow up to above review.  After sending my film to another customer they finally retrieved it.  When I talked to them they said they would rescan it to CD and send it by overnight mail.  Well they didn't send it by overnight and I finally received the roll three weeks after sending it in.  The film negatives were not cut and mounted in archival sleeves.  Moreover the scans were standard jpeg and not the deluxe jpg I had ordered.  I called them and told them I wanted a full refund and would not do business with them again.< /review>

They are one of the few photo labs that still does chemical processing. They also have a great film selection, and some of the more funky distressed films are available. The staff is super knowledgeable. I have also got some photos printed large format on wood and metal and their printing is great. I once cropped my photo incorrectly the staff caught it and called to fix before printing. They really care! Such a great place!<//review>

This store knows how to help everyone from the beginning photographer to the pros in the world. If you write them an email - they'll respond quickly. If you show up in-store and there's a line, they'll make sure you're taken care of in a timely matter.

They offer an extensive variety of film along with printing services - and all for a reasonable price. In a hurry? Order online and pick up in store. Easy, fast and efficient.<//Review>

< review>
I've likely spent $8,000+ dollars here with both personal and client work (commercial and editorial) throughout the last 4-5 years. Maybe even more than that but wanted to stay on the generous side for this review.

I'm generally happy with the convenience factor but if you are a professional/trained artist or knowledgeable/experienced, you'll see the corners that are cut and the inconsistencies throughout their post-processing (even though the cost is at a premium and continually rising).

For instance, if you ask for wide-channel scanning when you drop-off, they will slap black boarders around your images after the scan rather than actually doing it while scanning the negative or simply forgot to do it all together. In some cases, they will say it can't be done because they've cut the film already (which behooves me as I get cut 6 so shouldn't the majority of the images still be wide-channel scannable?).  A las, one must call them up, listen to a bit of their whining about having to re-scan and then half the time it's the same result – black frames slapped. In a few cases they have taken creative liberties by cropping the image slightly slapping on the boarder (even worse than before). So as an entire week goes by, I pick up my negatives and end up scanning them myself at home (no refund of course) and capture the beautiful Hasselblad notches in every frame.</review>

The best that you can get. I've had my film developed/scanned at places across the country and have never had a better experience than I consistently have at Photoworks. The price is right, and their scan quality is unmatched. There's no place I'd rather use.<//Review>

<review>I've had great experiences there and also bad ones, mostly involving customer service and only one (large) order being fraked up. The student discount is nice, and they have a good selection of film. I will recommend this place; though there are other places throughout the city, Photoworks is probably the most convenient.</review><username>Dayan Romero<//username>< rating>

< Review>
Developed 2 rolls here and had them put on a CD. Checked the CD in-store at their kiosk before leaving because I was afraid of a blank CD after reading a review here, but there were no issues! The long turnaround and inconvenient hours are why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. Film dropped off Saturday and ready Tuesday at 6pm, but they close at 7pm and open at 10am which makes getting there to pick-up during the week very difficult.</Review>

When I went to pick up the first print, it  was scratched all over and had really obvious big ugly lines and smudges on it. I spotted them immediately.
I could not believe they actually tried to pawn it off on me! They agreed to do another on softer paper. That had a six inch long smudge on it as well. I wrote an email complaining (for the first time in 20 years) about their lack of professionalism and possible ingestion of substances that cloud vision and judgement. One of the owners...Michael... wrote me a pissy email defending their (incompetent) non-pot-smoking employees and told me to take my business elsewhere. I've spent $500 there since June. (I've been using PhotoworksSF since the early 90s). I refused
the prints and they said they would refund my (paid in advance of course) money. It took them THIRTEEN days to ruin two 8x10 prints. I can't recommend them.</Review>< pics>

Bad customer service over email. Asked about getting a rush job done and it took several emails to finally get an answer of "they do not do rush jobs and they need 3-4 business days to print." They should have just told me that in the first place instead of us going back and forth. Not helpful nor professional in their tone either.

Will not be bringing my business here.< /Review>

Beautiful and small park to bring your children and walk around. I like this place a lot. This park is great walking. You will always see children playing all around. My daughter loves this friendly park.<//Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>It's a simple park with enough to keep you entertained for a bit. There is a two story play area for kids that include jungle gyms, Bridges and slides. The floor is made of rubber so that children don't get hurt too badly if they fall. Can't forget the swings and mini water park. They have one basketball court and two baseball fields (for youth teams use only). They have a few picnic tables and a tables to use for small family events.  Lastly, the park has a cement path that circles the park, which is around 400 meters, so it's actually a pretty cool spot to go for a jog.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great little park with a cool splash pad, clean restrooms. A nice cement trail to walk jog or the little ones can bike. Baseball fields and basketball court are great for the older kids. And nice shaded bench area perfect for BBQing.< /Review>

I guess this park is great when everything is open but right now everything is gated off. Not sure if it's permanent or upgrading but the park itself looks nice.< /review>

I love that park. Its a great park to have a picnic, play in the playgrounds with your little cousins or children, to get wet, and to do exercise. Also to have lots of fun spending time with your family :)< /Review>

Great park, or used to be great. Now they kind of block/locked parts of it so lets all hope it is something temporary and not for good.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The facilities are very good
What I did not like on 2 occasions that I went to the water area
People bathing their dogs (first time)
Children as 12 or 15 years old running and pushing younger children
Other children with water guns
With the pressure they hurt his eye to my child and nobody watches 😞

(Original)
Las instalaciones están muy bien
Lo que no me gustó en 2 ocasiones que he ido al área de agua
Gente bañando a sus perros ( primer vez)
Niños como de 12 o 15 años corriendo y empujando a niños más pequeñitos
Otros niños con pistolas de agua
Con la presión le lastimaron su ojo a mi niño y nadie vigila 😞< /Text>
