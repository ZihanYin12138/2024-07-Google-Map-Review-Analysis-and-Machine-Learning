<response>{'time': 1622125347989, 'text': "Thanks Gus! You're a great patient to have! Much appreciated!"}</response><Review>I can't say enough about Dr. Mike and his very friendly staff.  I've had major pains and headaches for about 2 decades and was blessed to find Dr. Mike.  I've been visiting the Doctor for about a month and a half and have been feeling GREAT!  I haven't had a headache or migraine since I've been going which is amazing.  I used to have an intense pain on my left temple and its completely gone.  I've been taking all the natural remedies the doctor has suggested including drinking more water and I'm really feeling better and getting a good nights sleep every night.  I don't have any urges to pop my neck or back and really feel like my spine is lining up and everything is being put back into place.  I'm so grateful and happy I found the Doctor and I really enjoy visiting his office and staff, they make me feel real comfortable like I'm at home.  The best part of this whole experience is that I'm always in a better mood because I'm not feeling any pain or discomfort.  Dr. Mike is an amazing guy and is definitely serving his purpose.  He's super friendly and always in a positive mood, he communicates everything clearly and explains how he can help.  I HIGHLY recommend anyone that is pain and discomfort to please make an appointment with Dr. Mike.  I promise it will be worth it and you will feel much better.</Review>< pictures>

I had severe shoulder elbow and wrist pain from the long covid lockdown period of working from home like many others.

I saw different types of doctors and orthopedic surgeons who could not help me with my issues. After a few sessions with Dr Mike my arm, shoulder, and back are pain free and I can go back to living my life and enjoy spending time with my family playing and horsing around with my 2 year old kid without fear of having my arm give out.

I'm still in the middle of my treatment sessions but already have a very positive outlook to my before and after results by the end of my scheduled treatment thanks to his very methodical and practical approach.

Highly recommended and worth the drive even if you are coming from far away!</Text>

<review>I would like to say I am on cloud 9 every time I come to see Dr. Mike. My back feels great after a few adjustments I had so far. I sleep better and come to think about it my numbness and tingling are gone  from my arm and leg. Praise God!! Thanks Dr.Mike.  You’re the man!</review>< Pictures>

<time>1617419672502< /time><rating>5<//rating><review>Before finding Dr. Mike, I’d been in pain off and on for over 3 years. During that time, I was treated by my primary doctor, an orthopedist, a physical therapist,  and two other chiropractors. None were able to help relieve my pain.   And when in their offices, I always felt like just a number.

I’m so grateful that I found Dr. Mike.   He’s warm, friendly, compassionate, and knowledgeable.  He really takes his time to get to know you  and to make sure you feel comfortable every step of the way.  After just one adjustment, I was able to sleep through the night for the first time in months!

Currently, I’m  half way through my treatment plan;  and my progress has exceeded my hopes and expectations.   My daily debilitating pain, migraines, and pinched nerves are gone!   Plus, I can see the difference in the shape of my body too.  My posture is so much better., and my Tech Neck and Dowager’s hump are disappearing!   Dr. Mike is amazing!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1618955522615, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review.

<Text>Every one is extremely professional and informative . I love the music . Relaxing atmosphere. Last but not lease Dr.Mike is the best chiropractor I’ve been to and I have my fair share of experience with chiropractors. I came in with around 20years of chronic back pain and I’m only 33 . Now I don’t have any pain since my first visit . I’m a cosmetologist so I stand for hours and I’ve noticed that my back don’t even hurt after I’ve finished working . I am highly recommending HB chiropractic . Changed my life in a real way .</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

TREATMENT PLAN ON POINT! Diagnosed with Spinal Arthritis, which helped me determine the correct plan to manage the pain and discomfort.  After a month of consistent lifestyle changes  such as Diet, Vitamin Regiment (correct ones), and exercise which complimented my treatment plan.  I eat better, I rest better, and more importantly I gained my agileness back! I breather better!  I was guilty of being a constant self cracker, Never Again!

I’m a Journalist, Father, and Family Man: I feel I have the energy for it all and then some!</text>

<review>Dr. Mike is amazing. I've been a fitness addict for 20+ years and I knew my body was out of alignment. Fortunately, I met Dr. Mike at my crossfit gym and the rest is history. Dr. Mike diagnosed the issues and provided recommendations for treatment. Every appointment with Mike is healing and he's so good at what he does. I love his energetic attitude and the passion to help his clients.<//review><resp>{'time': 1616005256239, 'text': 'Thank you Henry! Very appreciated. We are so happy to have you as a patient.

<review>Dr Mike is great! I wanted to work with a chiropractor that really understands and respects proper movement and core lifts. I’ve been doing regular visits since October to treat various issues that have built up over the years. I’ve noticed a reduction in pain, improved posture and a significant difference in my workouts (range of motion). I would highly recommend!<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH DR. MIKE. I got into an accident and received some minor whiplash, so my friend advised me to go to Dr. Michael! I came in, got my x-ray, and have been on an amazing journey of well-being for about a few months now. Dr. Michael is so nice and personable. He is incredibly knowledgeable about his profession, loves his profession, and cares for people. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! He is such a cool guy! 😊<//Text>

I originally went to this chiro because my mom recommended it from seeing the videos on Instagram. I came in with little-to-no knowledge of the severity of my neck and spine problems until I saw Dr. Michael VanDerschelden. He took my X-rays on my first visit and by the next appointment he was able to consult his findings with me while providing detailed analysis of what was to be done. Each session results in my neck and different parts of my back cracking very loud and feeling amazing. After seeing him for several weeks I can say without a doubt that I feel a lot better and my posture is improving immensely.<//text>

Found Dr. Mike on TikTok. I’ve had Chiro treatment before and I knew immediately how talented he was, and I was so lucky he was close enough for me to drive to considering he could have been anywhere in the world.

I had been 20lbs over my normal weight the past two years and decided to lose it while also fixing some issues that come from a lot of sitting and lack of exercise (including carpel tunnel). I’m halfway through my prescribed treatment with Dr. Mike and I’ve lost 12 lbs and feel fantastic.

It takes work on my side, good nutrition too, but know that Dr. Mike can likely help you if you are willing to help yourself ;)

I’ve already brought two friends in. I trust him.</review>

<Text>Dr. Mike is fantastic! I have been having low back pain, leg pain and migraines for years. Since I started going here my migraines have gone away instantly and my lower back pain has gotten better. Dr Mike always listens to my pain of the week and works with me to get me better every time. You know he is good when you recommend your own family to start going with him and they are happy they did.  Have to love Eva too. She always tries to fit me in the schedule when it’s best for me and my kids love her stickers.< /Text></record>

Dr Mike is great! After years of searching for a good chiropractor, switching from chiro to chiro, I finally found someone who is truly interested in helping me feel my best. My experience with most chiropractors is they give you the same standard 4 cracks and your out the door. Mike takes his time to study your posture and spine and makes a personalized plan to correct your imbalances and target the areas of your spine that need to be corrected. I felt 2 inches taller after leaving his office the first time and after several months many issues that have plagued me from my neck to my knees has disappeared. Definitely give him a try, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.< /Text>

Dr. Michael VanDerscheldon is one of the best chiropractor!  I went to him after my car accident with unbearable pain.  I was in great shape and love to run, due to such pain from my back I could not even stand long or run.  My nephew who is a chiropractor from Dallas, Texas, referred me to him.  I am glad I listened to him.   Within three weeks of treatment from Dr. VanDerscheldon, my pain lessen and able to run again.  I felt hopeless before I came to his office.. Now, I know I will be get back to normal or even better than before.   He is a great doctor who makes me laugh when I get nervous.  We both laugh so much.  Thank you Doctor for you gift and talent!!!</Text>

Dr Mike is amazing! He has helped, and still is helping, ease my back pain. He is very informative and explains everything to me in a way that I can understand. His staff is equally amazing because they are so kind and sweet and are never afraid to start and keep a conversation! Overall, Dr. Mike and his staff are the best I’ve ever seen !< /review>

I found Dr. Mike’s tiktok videos by scrolling one day and felt it was a sign from the universe. I was able to book a consult and my first adjustment (2 days after consult - so Dr. can fully assess what your body needs) quickly. Dr. Mike listened to what I was suffering from and offered a plan that has helped me gain so many more good days back into my life. Since I started going two months ago, my chronic pelvic and low back pain has gone away and my leg pain has improved. Shout out to Ava too, she’s such a sweet heart and works with my schedule every week!< /review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pics>

Been going to Dr. Mike for about 2 weeks, when I walked in I knew that I was in the right spot just the way he was talking seemed like he had all the answers without even looking deeper at my situation. I walked in and was at the point were it hurt to sit, lay down, stand, move around, you name it I was in pain. I had been to a chiropractor in the past but was shocked that Dr. Mike wanted to do x-rays being that I had never had them done before. Needless to say I was a mess my spine was all over the place looked like a Slalom course and well 5 visits later I feel amazing and look forward to getting up and going to the appointment. I mentioned to him I can’t wait to see the next set of x-rays those will be coming up in the next month or so. Best chiropractor in town hands down. Stop wasting time and money and see Dr. Mike.<//text>

I've known about Dr. Mike for some time from his videos on YouTube. Very good and informational about health and fitness and he provides studies to back it up. I decided to check out his office due to some back pain. I'm glad I did. It's a very open and welcome environment and everyone there is nice. Dr. Mike explains things very well. I highly recommend.< /text>

So many amazing things to say about Dr.Mike!! I came in after a car accident with a lot of issues and chronic pain in my neck and entire back. Living in chronic pain affects every area of your life and Dr.Mike was so committed to doing whatever it took to help my body heal and get me out of pain. He has done wonders for me on my road to recovery!! He has done so many different treatments for me and has even stayed longer during my appointments if that’s what it takes to ensure that I’m pain free! And now, I no longer live in chronic pain! He is the VERY BEST and I know that because I’ve been going to the Chiropracter for 15 years and I’ve never had treatment that is THIS INCREDIBLE!!! I will never go anywhere else! He is so encouraging, knowledgeable, and is always laughing with his clients and brightening their day! So grateful for HB Chiropractic !!</Review>

I'm on a maintenance program to keep things pain free and running smoothly.  Have been doing a lot of mountain biking lately.  Things have been going really great since I've started the adjustments.  Dr Mike's precision in his targeted adjustments are pretty amazing.  And I especially value the feedback I've received on everything from stretching to workouts to dietary recommendations.</Review>

I had hurt my lower back during a workout in late October.
I never felt so immobile in my life.
Thankfully I came across Dr. Mike at Huntington Beach Chiropractic 🤗
After just a couple of adjustments I had noticed a significant improvement.
I appreciate how thorough he is and I learn something new with each treatment.
I highly recommend Dr. Mike!<//review>

I have had upper back pain and right sided posterior rib pain for about 9 months.  I tried medications and stretching. Nothing really helped until I saw Dr. Mike.  He did  X-rays which showed some degenerative changes in my spine.  He adjusted my spine and used a vibrating instrument to loosen up the tissues.    After several treatments the pain resolved.

Occasionally the pain comes back when I do a lot of upper body twisting such as when I go stand up paddling in the ocean for a few hours or when I play 18 holes of golf.  Then another adjustment or two and it is gone!

Thanks Dr. Mike!  Now I can enjoy my stand up paddling and golfing again!!</review>

I can’t say enough about Dr. Mike!  I spend 8-10 hr stints at a desk in a fixed listening position for work and my pain level became unmanageable.  I went to see Dr. Mike and after X-Rays, he sat me down and explained what was causing my pain.  The morning after my first adjustment was the first morning in years that I woke up without severe pain.  Each adjustment since has helped tremendously and my quality of life has improved greatly.  I trust him completely and can’t recommend him enough.  He is extremely patient and explains every aspect of what he does.  If you’re in pain then it’s worth sitting down with Dr. Mike and seeing what he can do for you.< /review>

My experience with Mike has been one of professionalisms and a high level of attention and care. As he also knows the body and spine so well that every session brings about some new level of shift and healing.

<review>I’ve always had neck strain and figured there was nothing to be done about it. I attributed this discomfort to a number of things e.g. age, stress, general abuse from sports earlier in my life. Relatively clueless of the chiropractic profession, my wife suggested I see one. After about the 10th request, she made an appointment for me and I, well, showed up with no expectation of real results.

Fast forward to today, under Dr. Mike’s care, I’m pain free. Honestly, I didn’t fully appreciate how much discomfort I had until I experienced life without a nagging pain in my neck / shoulders. It has been truly life changing.

If you are someone with chronic pain or no pain but never have been to a chiropractor, I’d whole heartedly recommended you see Dr. Mike or his wife, who has a chiropractic practice in the same office. The consultation process was seamless, you get a detailed report (to include x- rays) and an adjustment, all for a very reasonable price.

I can’t say enough about this experience and to top it all off, I’d say Dr. Mike genuinely cares about his clients and their individual journey to leading a healthy life. And I consider him as a friend today.<//review>< Pictures>

Have gone to many different Chiropractors over the years and no place leaves me feeling better than Huntington Beach Chiropractic. The care provided here is second to none, and Dr. Van really cares for his patients and is trained to give the best results. Take home tips for excercises and stretches are also very helpful.</review>

<review>So thankful that my husband and I found Dr. Mike. I had neck pain accompanied by bad headaches often and my husband was struggling with a workout related back injury. Both of us have found relief after seeing Dr. Mike for a couple of months. He really takes his time and is very thorough. We also love that Dr. Aimee at Momma’s Chiro can see our boys 4 & 3 years old in the same office. 🙏🏻 Side note: I’ve been trying to get my husband to see a chiropractor for years and he has always been a skeptic until he saw Dr. Mike! Oh & we love Ava at the front desk. The whole office is wonderful & is so family friendly.</review>< Pics>

Although Dr. Cooper is no longer giving me adjustments. Dr. Mike is just as good. His technique is different and amazing. Getting adjusted by him makes you feel energized and ready for the rest of the day. His staff is also friendly and amazing! Highly recommended!<//Review>

Dr. Mike and the whole staff at HB Chiropractic are incredible!!! I was in a bad car accident last year, l was in so much pain mostly neck and back. He brought me back to better than normal. I’m running again and I am sleeping though the night and have so much energy. I never thought I could feel like this! If you have never done chiropractic before... this was life changing. I can’t thank you enough!!! Patient for life!</text>

Been coming here since 2009 and have always had nothing but excellent service and results.  My migraines are gone and I always feel so much better after an adjustment.  The pre-natal adjustments were clutch! While I miss Dr. Cooper, Dr. Mike has been a great replacement and I'm very happy!  Dr. Mike can do more than just adjust you, he can also help target the muscles that are causing the issue.  I would definitely recommend!< /review>

<text>Love this place! I went against by husbands wishes (he WAS anti-chiro). I have had excellent good results with pain relief from a neck injury and better all-around health! A year ago my husband had to change his tune and is also seeing Dr. Mike. He's not the type to do a review, but I can tell you, he went from not being able to tie his shoes to regularly bending over to pick stuff up off the floor. I'd say that's great results.</text>< time>

< review>
Going into the office my back was hurting and I was desperate for repair. In order for the most effective results Dr. Mike took Xrays and did a posture analysis on me. The attention to detail and the analysis that he was able to show me was amazing. He took the time to break down the angles and showed me the numbers to help explain why I was feeling the way that I was. After just the first visit I was feeling the relief that I was searching for. He walked me through the different positions and made sure I was okay before he began the adjustment. He explained why he was trying to adjust me the way he was each time. I highly recommend this office if you are looking to actually fix/ promote a better overall health. Thank you HB Chiropractic!<//review>

<review>I am more than exited to have learned that Dr. Mike has his own practice, in Huntington Beach. He had been adjusting my spine  a few years back for a different Chiropractor and decided to move on. I recently found him through Instagram and found out  he was practicing In HB. At first chance, I booked an appointment and was happy as ever to see him again.
After a thorough exam and X-ray, he then went over my results with me. He laid out a pathway for improvement, and we discussed all my concerns.
I am now 5 weeks into adjustments with Dr Mike, and let me tell you I feel much better. He is absolutely the best Chiropractor and preventive Dr. I know. He seriously takes time with me and really listens to what I’m telling him. Dr. Mike is so patient and attentive, I always feel he takes the necessary time, and steps to make me feel great at every visit.
My past experiences with other Chiropractors over the last 20 years was exactly opposite. I felt rushed and I was in and out of a visit and not feeling better.
Dr. Mike is the best at what he does, he is not just a Chiropractor, he is much more.
Thank you so much for all that you have done for me, on the adjustment table and off.
Sincerely
Tyler Phillips

I'm an EMT, which means lots of lifting heavy patients with my back.  I started seeing Dr. Mike for preventative, but turns out I had some issues I didn't even know about.  I know what you're thinking, but seriously he has created a new normal for me I didn't know I was missing.  I thought I was fine before, but I feel even better now.  My posture is improving, I can breathe easier, and a lot of tension is leaving my back that I wasn't aware was there.  Can't recommend him enough.</Review>

Dr. Mike has been nothing but knowledgeable, kind, and eager to help. When I first started seeing Dr. Mike, I was experiencing a constant pain in my lower back, after a few adjustments I saw noticeable improvements. I have now been seeing him for almost 7 months and have never felt better! Highly recommend you give him a shot!< /Text>

The best.  After my wife was in a car accident we tried at least 6 other chiropractors without success.  Dr. Cooper got results in a few visits and helped get her back to better than ever.  She recently started treating me for chronic back and neck problems and I've made amazing progress very quickly.  Try them you won't be sorry.< /text>

Dr. Jen is great.  I have visited her multiple times for different reasons.  One in particular was after an injury during an Ice Hockey game and my alignment was off and causing pain.  She quickly remedied the problem and got me the relief I needed to keep playing.   She is very knowledgeable in all areas of health and I recommend her any chance I get.</Review>

This review is on behalf of my husband, Eric. Took me forever to convince him to go, because...MEN. He has had a lot of pain in his neck, shoulders, mid-back, low-back, all over. I went with him to his initial appointment because he would (and did say) nothing was wrong with him. I then listed out all his pain he complains about. Dr. Mike did a posture analysis and x-rays so it was helpful to see exactly where the sources of pain are and why Eric was feeling the way he was. Dr. Mike put him on an extensive plan to correct multiple areas in his spine,Eric feels so much better and is looking forward to continued health. Dr. Mike definitely practices what he preaches as far as his treatment and has been an incredible resource for health - he’s been sharing supplements and workout stuff he uses that’s also been a big help to Eric. He’s super responsive to emails when we have questions and we’re extremely appreciative of his chiropractic care. If you’re pregnant or a mama, go see his wife, Dr. Aimee at Momma’s Chiro!<//Text>

<review>I am an active 51-year-old woman.  When I could not practice yoga and attend body combat classes due the pain I experienced, I sought help.  These classes are very important to my mental health.  After a few  weeks of having adjustment from Dr. VanDerschelden, I resumed my usual activities.  Not only he addressed my neck, back and knee issues, he also helped adjust my wrists as I am an avid cook.  Many thanks and much appreciation to Dr. VanDerschelden for helping me maintain my active life!</review>< Pictures>

If you've never had a chiropractic adjustment, let your first experience be with Mike V!

He is thorough with his process, and also offers the perfect explanation for everything.

He is friendly, knowledgeable, and excellent in his practice.

Prior to becoming his patient, I never had any chiropractic services performed.  So, while I don't have other chiropractors to compare him to, I would say I am happy with my adjustments.  They are therapeutic, and I always leave feeling 💯😃

P.S. He won't make you feel self-conscious about your sweaty palms or feet.  Rather, justifies it with the physiology behind it.  A true gentleman in the field.<//Text>

Dr. Cooper has taken such great care of me! Some days she's gentle and some days she's a little more forceful for the adjustments. She varies her technique on how swollen my back is from all the heavy lifting I do at work. Every time I leave her office aI am more relaxed, happier, and feel better. You can not go wrong by choosing to see Dr. Cooper. She will take sure great care of you!<//Text>

<Text>Stop your search. Dr. J and the rest of the HB Chiro team are the absolute best. I have referred more than one person and have yet to hear anything other than rave reviews. Their experience and skill set allow them to handle just about any issue, whether you are young or old. Car accident? Pregnancy? Scoliosis? Just need an adjustment? They are amazing.

< Review>
I started coming to Dr. Michael VanDerschelden about 4 months ago and it has changed my life. I had a bad skateboarding accident where I landed on my neck and now my neck is reversed. I have been in constant neck pain for years. I have been going to Chiropractors for the past 4 years and it only has temporarily stopped the pain. The thing I noticed about Dr. Van from other Chiropractors is his attention to specific details about your body. Once you walk into the room he knows what to do.

Since coming to Dr. VanDerschelden I can now sleep better at night and I don’t have a constant aching feeling in my neck anymore. During the first visit he showed me stretches and things to do at home to help the curve in my neck. I highly recommend Dr. VanDerschelden for anyone that’s been in a tragic accident or has yet to find a solution to their pain. He’s very educated in the chiropractic field and I can’t see myself ever going to anyone else!< /Review>

< Review>
I have been dealing with back pain for years and any time after a high intensity exercise I would lose the ability to walk properly for a day or two.  I have seen multiple doctors throughout the years with the only two choices being rest (and don't exercise) or consider surgery.  I came here and within months I have gone from not being able to walk after heavy training to doing high intensity workouts almost every day.  They have done more for my back pain in a couple months than any doctor/physical therapist did in years.</Review>

<Review>Dr Jen is the best!  Been going to her for 2 years now.  I came in for a 4 month program to get my spine back to optimal shape.  Now I just go there for maintenance a couple times a month.  Super happy with the results I saw on my before/after X rays.  I've already sent 4 other people to her that all said the same thing I did.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Dr. Cooper is very thorough and caring and she has helped me a great deal just in the few weeks that I have been under her care. I still have a ways to go to feel completely better but Dr. Cooper has really helped me with my back issues. Alex is great at the front desk and keeps things running right on schedule which I appreciate with my busy schedule. If you need chiropractic services this is the place to go!

As I update this review, I have now been under the care of Dr. Cooper for 6 months and when I came in last September the pain was severe and I had a hard time walking, standing or sitting. I was tired all of the time because I was not sleeping well and my life was not very satisfying at all. Now, in the last few weeks especially, I am not in any pain about 90% of the time, I am sleeping much better and therefore have more energy throughout the day. I just want to thank Dr. Cooper for the care that she has given me. I would highly recommend her for all your chiropractic needs.<//Text>

<review>Huntington Beach Chiropractic is so good at what they do. They truly care about their clients and you can tell that by the attention they give to your back pain needs. Dr. Campagna, Dr. Cooper and Alex who calls to remind you of your appointments they're all great. I love the wall with all the satisfied clients pictures. Huntington Beach Chiropractic is really good at what they do and they will help your back pain go away. They take x-rays and even sit you down and show you how you're improving and what the expected results are. Everything they do is thought out and done professionally. So if you want to get healthily....get adjusted by Huntington Beach Chiropractic. You'll be happy that you did.</review><username>Jenna Wood<//username>< Gmap_id>

It was either a chiropractor or surgery. I really didn't believe in chiros until i had a need.  She took x-rays before and after, discounted my fees as i self paid and resolved my condition.  She gets a 10 out of 10.<//review>< time>

<Text>Historical park?!...
There's history definatly being made here.
It's one where city allows a nice beautiful little park turn into a trashed out homeless encampment.
Trash and God knows what else running into the creek.
Closing it off to tax paying citizens.
SMH
You want to give the homeless a place to stay? How about you contact Alameda County and open up the homeless shelters and psychiatric hospitals.
Avoid this place until they clean it up.

Very professional! My insurance didn’t cover the procedure but the lady at the front desk helped me open a credit card so I could get my procedure done! One of the best experiences I’ve ever encountered from all the dentist I’ve ever been to!! The staff was very friendly and made sure I was comfortable and free of pain! Best work I’ve ever received!! Highly recommend!! Plus the massage chairs do wonders!</text>

My husband needed emergency treatment, they were able to see us the same day as a potentially new patient. His own dentist wouldn’t see him the same day as an emergency visit. The staff and dentist were so welcoming, professional and patient. He has terrible anxiety and they were all amazing with him. Needless to say we have both switched over to their care and will be recommending them to the rest of our family.< /Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Time>1619194201736</Time><Text>In the covid-19 era, you're always going to have reservations about the safety of your health & those around you. I finally had my appointment @ SBFD.  At first I was a little apprehensive because you don't want to become ill.  Everyone in the office is there to make sure you feel relaxed & safe.  Dr.Chahal & Alicia are great. They provide excellent care for your teeth and take the precautions needed to provide for the safety of your health. Stacey & the front office are super.  When it comes to your dental work, Smile Bright Family Dentistry is the place to go. April 23, 2021. This place is so great! Had MAJOR pain in tooth. Doctor saw me and determined what needed to be done. Stephanie was so very helpful in scheduling. The entire staff is simply GREAT!!! Don't settle for less when you can go to the best!!!!👌👍🙂< /Text>< GmapID>

I love my mother, and her care is one of my priorities. She had a procedure, and even though the next day she had pain normally associated with the procedure, she was happy. She also had meds waiting at the pharmacy as she was told she would. She told me the appointment went smoothly. So smooth, she didnt realize when they where done. Many poor experiences in other places really made it easy to appreciate good care.<//Text>

<Review>Not only could they not figure out my insurance they were trying to make me pay $1700 for a root canal. Went somewhere else and I only paid $375 outta pocket. Also I cried with the numbing shot which I never have anywhere else because they shake my cheek to distract me from the pain of the needle. I was definitely over charged for my extractions I got done there unfortunately... paid for 50% when my insurance covers 80%. The dentist barely said anything to me which I didn't like as my normal dentist talks and walks me thru the entire procedure.
U wouldn't suggest this place to anyone.< /Review><UserId.>100850295495946143757</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Alicia is good at what she does. She is very knowledgeable, thorough, and very gentle. The Doctor was also great. He is going to fix my past dentist mistake. Stacey was very welcoming. I would definitely recommend Smile Bright!<//text>

The dental office and their staff were extremely nice. I was a new patient and they treated me so well. I've been holding off going to the dentist because of embarrassment and knowing all the work i needed done. They made me feel comfortable and the dentist was nice and explained everything.  I will be going back and making appointments for my kids.
Thank you!!!</Text>

<review>I was so pleasantly pleased at how wonderful Dr Chahal and his staff treated me.  I have always been afraid of dentists but Dr Chahal was fantastic.  I would highly recommend him. His staff are kind and very caring.  Since I am new to the area I struck gold when I found this dental practice.  Thank you Dr Chahal, Stacy and his dental assistant!!!<//review>< resp>

The entire staff is so friendly and helpful! They made me feel comfortable and answered all of my questions regarding my insurance coverage and upcoming treatments.  They are very fast and did not keep me waiting… but, I would not have minded since they sat me in a massaging dental chair. Five star experience!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>The BEST experiences here. Staff is so knowledgeable and accommodating to any schedule. If you need an appointment, you don't need to wait another two weeks. They get you in ASAP, which is amazing to have a dental office that's reliable. I got a filling last month and my experience was GREAT. Everything went by so smoothly and I can just tell he really knew what he was doing as it was executed with ease. It also really helped that he periodically asked me if I was still okay/comfortable. Before I left I made sure to tell him that was the best dental experience I've had. I definitely recommend!!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Love this office. I moved my family from another office to this office about a year or so ago. We are very pleased with the service we receive here. They treat you more like family  then just a patience. We are so glad we made this move and would highly recommend this office to those interested in having the best dental experience.<//Review>

Great Office! Dr Chahal greeted me with a warm welcome. He made me feel at home and took care of my cavity on a Saturday so I didn't have to take time off work. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.
Highly recommend them!!!</review>

<Text>We found our dentist office. We absolutely love coming here. The staff is super friendly, office very clean and we especially love Alicia. She is so gentle, never feel the work she is doing, which is awesome. Dr. Chanal is great and also very gentle (I'm scared of needles and he knows how to make you comfy). I highly recommend Dr. Chanal.< /Text>< Pics>

I came in for a dental emergency. My nerves were shot and I was so scared. But the staff and Dr Chahal were very calming. They got me in right away and took such great care of me! His diagnosis was spot on and they were so patient and kind with my circumstance. I would definitely go again if I needed regular or urgent dental work.< /Review>

<Review>I had a deep cleaning done that left my teeth ruined! The lady that did my deep cleaning scraped my teeth so bad she exposed my fillings. And as a result my teeth have been chipping and a couple of fillings have come out. My teeth have also been in pain ever since. I was afraid to go back and to try another dentist. The lady who did mu deep cleaning also did my husband teeth and she left scrape marks all on his lower front teeth. Our teeth needs more work now because of this place. Not to mention they will screw you on billing. My husband and I paid in full every time we had services done. Earlier this year someone in the office called me and said the bookkeeper the used to have made a bunch of mistakes and didn't bill correctly and they had to go back and undo everything she did which is why we are now being billed. I was also told Stacy was no longer an employee at the time but she is back in the office. I spoke to her today regarding making an appt to check out my damaged teeth and regarding the billing. She was very unprofessional when I mentioned what I was told regarding the bookkeeper making mistakes and she had the nerve to retaliate by saying, "well I'm going to take a look at your account and make sure we didn't make any mistakes with your ballance and go ahead and bill you for services you haven't paid for." First of all I've paid for all of my services. But now since she took that tone with me I will never go back to that place. Stacy is very unprofessional. She conducted herself in such an unprofessional manner. I'll be looking for an honest, trustworthy, professional and reliable dental office for myself and my family. My husband and I will never be back at this place again. Make sure you keep all paperwork and receipts. I have all of mine so once I gather everything up I will be going to management.. Good luck<//Review>< Pics>

Came in and got my cleaning done by Alicia and it was by far the best cleaning I have ever had she is super gentle and really explains and answers all your questions. I had my wisdom teeth pulled by Dr Chahal and that procedure went very smooth I am terrified of needles and I did not feel a thing the assistants are very knowledgeable and reassuring and the office is kept very clean. Also Se habla español so it is a plus i highly recommend this office.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I don't even know where to start! All I know is it's taken me years to find such an amazing dentist. About a year-and-a-half ago I went to my regular dentist and had some work done, and somehow, he must have opened my jaws too wide, and for months I suffered from TMJ. I went back to my dentist twice after the work was done and both times he shared there was nothing he could do and that the work was fine. I then started to the chiropractor because the pain was so intense and I didn't know what else to do. I went twice a week to have my jaw popped in, and that didn't work. I was popping Motrin left and right when I finally called Kaiser and they recommended physical therapy. Then I was referred to Smile Bright Family Dentistry and Dr. Chahal shared he could make a few adjustment, and he did. And that was it!! Within a few weeks later my TMJ pain went away. My whole life I've been told I had a small mouth, and I've always dreaded going to the dentist. Dr. Chahal cured me from that. He and his entire stuff are wonderful. If anyone's ever loathed going to the dentist from fear of pain or of bad results you have to give Dr. Chahal a try! You will have no regrets!< /text>< pictures>

When I first saw this dentist office I had my share of doubts about this doctor and his team but when I was finally sitting on the seat of the room where my procedure took place I finally understood why Dr. Chahal and his team are the one of the most recommended in Turlock and it's nearby towns. The procedure itself was a great experience one of the best anyone could get from a dentist. Hygienist Mark was the one that performed the procedure he was very warm and welcoming and was very careful and steady with his work. I also met Dr. Chahal on the way out and I must say he is a very nice man and deserves all the compliments. I completely recommend Smile Bright Family Denistry to everyone who is unsure on who to rely on!<//text>

<Text>I visited Dr. Chahal's office earlier this week and I was absolutely amazed! I was greeted by the staff with enthusiasm and warmth. All the staff, including Dr. Chahal, himself, made me feel comfortable with getting my dental needs taken care of. The RDH, Alicia did an incredible job in assisting Dr. Chahal with my procedure. Also, the massaging chairs are definitely a plus! I highly recommend Smile Bright Family Denistry!! 100%</Text>< response>

<Text>Serene park for hiking camping and more! A numbers of trails are closed due to the fires in 2020.  Some of the bridges are also out for the season, and should be back in business by April.  RV (no hookups) and tent camping are available and can be reserved through reserveCalifornia.com. Special call out to the park staff.  Answers your questions and support you with a smile.  Be sure to ask for recommendations on trails, as they know the park very well. No cell signal, so be sure to let your family/friends before you set out for this park!)<//Text>< pictures>

Loved the campsite, the restrooms and the dish washing station! It was especially great coming on a weekday we basically had the place to ourselves!<//Review>

I bring my son here and go biking, he’s always in awe seeing the giant red woods! Loves this area to get away and see the forest up close and personal. Great for hiking with friends and family. @BEACHLIFECO totally supports this state park 🤙<//review>

First time here, friendly rangers and host. I brought my daughter and stayed in site 21. The site was pretty small, really only room for one tent. I noticed many of the sites are small, so do your research. Facilities were all functioning and very clean. There’s a great sandy beach for kids located at the end of the Portola Group Camp, bring your floaties!< /review>

<Review>Lots of mosquitos in August!  Seemed to actually be attracted to two different bug sprays we used.   Beautiful scenery and trails.  Water play in the creek and great camp host James.< /Review>< rate>

It was our first time to the redwoods and we got a true forest experience here. You feel like you’re on Endor! The grounds are well-kept, there is firewood for purchase at $10 a bundle, hot showers for 50 cents and up. There are great easy trails perfect for kids and lots of gigantic redwoods. The “crumb clean” mentality is no joke. The jay birds are ruthless and we’re thrilled when they found a dropped cracker. There are tons of meat bees that are seemingly harmless but annoying. I wish I had been better prepared for the bees and mosquitoes but other than that we had an amazing time.< /Text><Time>1562429998999<//Time>< name>

The camp host is a real good guy.
He is very helpful and very friendly.
He has a good dog( Fiddler ) that is cool too.
Have been camping here while working in Stanford. Nicer than a hotel, and cheaper too.
Site 39 is the best, two flat places for tents and away from everyone.  Can’t see another site from 39. 3 is good too.
Reservations are made on the web. A little tricky to navigate.
Bathrooms near 52 are the better of the two. Use the handicap shower in back, it gets the best hot water.

UPDATE:
Campgrounds are now closed.
I stayed in 10 different sites over the summer.
Stay away from 29, noise from out building is terrible.
# 3 is haunted ! Camp host saw lady in white walking down to 3 at 1:30am when know one was camping down there. Twice I woke up to my bear box open, when I know I shut it. Spooky.< /text>

<Review>The Alpine drive to the campground was nice- saw wildlife and lovely bird's-eye views of the Bay Area. The circle group campground was well tended and redwoods were excellent< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1XFBMRXpMZSsWBhKHlb-_b9gbro5fm7bets6F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQubYM4ArUtXpVSKwyNhga6a3dVNduP05s4Gz4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN10KZQ0U9QufBLWlL4besw5F4NB-WEHznz2Xo9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYYifhG8FjDb0gOBq7WZXjRHt2oWn55zAJ7Q5N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1i8In53xKfLQClRRBWv_uV9w2jju2FnAEc6O9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Environment  ☆☆☆☆- a standard camping environment with mountains with creeks.
facilities ☆☆☆☆- water, wash and restroom convenience.
miles away ☆☆☆☆- I'm in East Bay, about an hour away, suitable for families 5 star
management☆☆☆☆-fixed time can see park managers touring and managing facilities.
camp ☆-I am everywhere camp a little tilted, affecting sleep, and very many mosquitoes ( At peak times you can handle more than 100, it is recommended to bring more points of anti-mosquito equipment.

Because there is no network or telecommunications service, you can enjoy the peace for a while<//Review><Response>None< /Response><date>1561352304658</date><Rate>3<//Rate><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

<Response>None<//Response><date>1501200249015<//date><review>Beautiful campground nestled in a redwood forest.  I stayed in site 41, which was shady, albiet not as private as some of the other sites.

Sites are equipped with a fire ring with a heavy duty grate for cooking.  All sites have metal lockers to keep your food in.  Garbage bins are close to sites so it's easy to just throw out garbage as you generate it.

Modern restroom facilities are available, as well as showers.  Showers require quarters. It's $0.25 per minute and you start with $0.50/2 min.  Make sure to bring quarters; camp office hours are irregular and they don't have a lot of change.

Firewood is available for $10/bundle.  Make sure to have exact change or pay with credit.   Suggest stocking up to ensure you don't run out.

There are plenty of varying length hiking trails.  I highly recommend the one that goes to Tip Toe falls.   Walking along Pescsdero Creek is also very nice.

A great campground for peace and quiet.  People seem to go to sleep at a decent time and there are no problems with loud noises.

A good choice for families too (lots of kids around).

Oh and there is no cell service here. This is nice as it lets you disconnect.  You can get Verizon 1x by the camp office.  For stronger service you need to drive out a ways.  Just something to know in terms of communicating with others you're going to meet there, etc.</review>< pics>

<Review>I'll start with the positive. This place doesn't cost much to camp, it has a ranger station that supplies camp-like items and tourist trinkets, and it offers nature hikes. You can bring your doggos, but just make sure to keep them on their leashes. You cannot bring them on the trails however. This place is about two hours from Santa Cruz, but is about twenty minutes, maybe less, from Los Gatos. The bathrooms are separated by sex and are stalled (there's only three). There are outlets in the bathroom, so that was an unexpected surprise. There is also only two showers per camp site area. This place didn't seem too popular when I went, so I wouldn't expect much of a crowd. Mosquitoes swarm in hives where I was at. No matter how many citronella candles were lit and Off I was wearing, it still wasn't enough. There isn't any cell service and the emergency phone outside the ranger station is useless. If you do stay here,  just know that there are mountain lions in this area. One came in our camp site (we think it was after our two small dogs who were in our tent). It took over an hour for the ranger to get to the camp after we finally were able to call 911. We had heard the mountain lion screaming for the past couple of nights and it finally wandered into our tent. If you don't know what they sound like, youtube it. It's the scariest sound you will ever hear. What may have been scarier was the fact the ranger didn't know they made that sound. Also during our stay there was a pervert who tried something on a seven-year-old. The cops came and the little girl was okay, but there were no rangers anywhere. The only reason why we knew about it was because we pulled in when the sheriffs were there. I can't recommend this place. Also, there were no redwoods anywhere. Just a typical forest campground.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Friendly staff, great flavors in their ice creams.
The flavors lean towards the Mexican side especially in the chocolate and vanilla flavors, slightly cinnamon in the chocolates and a richer vanilla.<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
The elote preparado was horrible. The elote tasted like it was sitting in water. The cheese that was added, melted. Felt like I was eating a quesadilla with Monterey cheese. I got 2 oreo paletas.  Also not good. No cookie flavor, tasted like someone blended a cookie with water, then froze it.</review>

Cute n'Clean joint with friendly and knowledgeable staff that answer every ice cream Q&A with a smile, while giving you samples of Every Flavor you want to try.
Several tables and the large picture window provide a great place to take a break from a long day.
I got "Arroz con Leche" to go. Big mistake. Talk about distracted driving! Next time I need to put in trunk, or eat there.
This store is not affiliated with a similar shop  @ West Texas next to Nations.

Also they have a good variety of smoothies, juices and malts.

<Text>I've been coming here since it was called Chango Chamoy (three or four names ago?) and I've never had an issue till today. Paid almost $20 for a tamarind raspado that had WAY too much syrup with so many seed particles I had to throw it out. I also ordered a piñanada and got a mangonada I didn't want. Pretty disappointed.</Text><name>Darien Collin<//name><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) According to me, I called by phone so I could pick up the order as soon as it arrived. It turned out that the girl who took my order over the phone (she didn't sound so happy, by the way) hadn't done anything. I arrived and told the girl that I had ordered by phone and she charged me for my order and she told me that in a moment it was ready and you must not even call by phone. The lady who charged me, super nicer than the other tall young woman who was there, even apologized at least for the delay. I asked for a bionic without a banana, it always tastes delicious and they have always done it well for me. I also asked for a shave that by the way they only make it one size (large) and it tasted very sweet and a ball of ice that I couldn't even enjoy as shaved.

(Original)
Según yo llame por teléfono para poder recoger la orden en cuanto llegara. Resultó que la tipa que tomó mi orden por teléfono (por cierto no se escuchaba tan contenta) no había hecho nada. Llegue y le dije a la muchacha que había ordenado por teléfono y me cobro por mi orden y me dijo que en un momento estaba listo y has de cuenta que ni llame por teléfono. La señorita que me cobró, súper más amable que la otra alta joven que estaba ahí, hasta se disculpó por lo menos por la tardanza. Pedí un biónico sin plátano, siempre sabe muy rico y siempre me lo han hecho bien. También pedí un raspado que por cierto solo lo hacen de un tamaño (grande) y me supo muy dulce y una bola de hielo que ni lo pude disfrutar como raspado.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This place does not have air conditioning, it is putting both customers and the people who work there at risk.
It would be good to report the owner to the authorities as by law - The Heat Stress In and out - this is a safety risk.

I really like the atmosphere, good coffee, and nice interior. This is a good place to study or chill with friends. The drinks and foods were all tasty and worthwhile. If you're up for a fresh place with beautiful architecture then this is a must to visit. They have also  a big space for parking. Don't worry about that. Thank you very much!</review>

It's one of the best places in town! The foods, coffee, staff, and ambiance were great and fascinating. I had proved it when I visited there last week. The place was really captivating. It was polished, tidy, and the design was beautiful. Also, the coffee and the foods that the respectful staff served to me taste better and worth it. I greatly love to visit here from time to time. Thank you!< /review>

<review>This is my daily morning coffee spot, and it has been shortly after they opened about 2 years ago. I highly recommend because 1) the coffee is great, 2) the team is nice and welcoming. I highly recommend asking for an iced caramel vanilla latte. It's not on the menu, but it's THE BEST THING EVER.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
The store front was full of food and container garbage on 1/20/21.  I asked the girl (clerk) for the shop street address . She wouldn’t give.

She lied that the garbage belong to next door, a computer shop, which is not true. I complained to the City after finding out the street address which shouldn’t be a secret.

I write this review hoping potential customers would refrain from patronizing this irresponsible neighbor.< /Review>

Their menu is huge and they can make any coffee drink you can imagine.
It's quickly become a neighborhood staple.< /review>

A tiny local coffee shop with delicious breakfast sandwiches, muffins, cookies, various tea and coffee. Not a lot of seating as it's small. Great for a morning when you don't want a long breakfast and want to get started on the day quickly.< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>This is a very pleasant coffee shop that gives off a completely different  vibe than what I see these days. There isn't much table space so it is not really the same sit around and talk vibe that I would get from a Starbucks. Sit in inner part of the cafe and it is very serene. They play very soft instrumental music and I find it to be very relaxing. I order the dirty chai tea and a breakfast burrito, just a perfect combination for a quick breakfast.

The cafe does face the train tracks directly so you do get the rumbling train every few minutes but this was not a big deal to me.

Price: $$ ($5 coffee, $7 burrito)

Definitely a place to check out if you want to spend a few hours focusing on work or reading a book in the morning.<//Review><username>Phil Vo</username>< GmapID>

The staff used to be friendlier when we first started coming here in 2013. Nowadays, barely a hello on the way in and nothing on the way out. (especially from the guy). Maybe burned out.<//text>

Not only is it close by where I live, but I love that I can grab a quick and delicious coffee and walk about 10 feet and get onto the L and head downtown!
I really like their iced coffee, but I've also had a latte with almond milk. They have small pastries and breads that are also incredibly tasty! I love the Oat Jacks. I typically pick one up when I grab my coffee. They are also on the Gving app so there's another plus!
A must for coffee lovers when out in Parkside/Sunset!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Healthy meal and fast, friendly service. Clean dining room. Restroom was surprisingly immaculate but no toilet seat covers. Owner is very nice, smart, and down-to-earth, and it's so obvious she takes pride in her business. Our family loves the tofu here. Will definitely return when we're in the area.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

How can you go wrong with a yummy chicken bowl from Flame Broiler? I always go healthy and get broccoli instead of rice. Don't forget to get plenty of Magic Sauce.</Text>

I have been coming to this location for 4 years now and have never been let down by the excellent customer service of the owner and the employees. The food is not winning any awards or anything, but it's just meant to be a convenient, fast meal that's a tad healthier than your average burger or other fast food. I especially love Flame Broiler's choice of sauces, they're particularly good when mixed together (The "Magic" Sauce and the standard red "Hot" sauce). Overall I greatly enjoy the food, especially the beef. My only real complaint is that the drink lids are ridiculously hard to fit onto the cups without making a mess. The service here is extremely fast, a line out the door is hardly anything to worry about unless you're ordering something truly obscure from the menu (which is rare as they have a very simplified menu with mostly the basic Flame Broiler options that every location has).<//text>

This is a great place to eat for health conscious people. I regularly suggest Flame Broiler to patients of mine because of their balanced meal. I normally get either the chicken or beef bowl with veggies and no rice.<//text>

Wasn’t that great. My family and I went there after Disney. The meat wasn’t as cooked through as I would have liked it. You were still able to see some pink. We always go to the Apple valley one and I am never disappointed there. Sadly to say this wasn’t a good experience. Won’t be going there again. Although the customer service was good👍🏼< /Review>

I got a Chicken and beef and vegetable bowl. The meat was not fresh, tasted like it had been sitting in a warmer for a long time. Chicken was hard and dried out. Beef was not good either. Vegetables and rice were good. Not a good experience.<//Text>

Seriously, this is the ONLY location that gives you a half full bowl. Everywhere else I go, they will fill it up, and you can see the dome of the food. They also charge you extra for the brown rice. Terrible! I don't know how they do their business, but this is rice, veggie, chicken, beef and tofu. Nothing fancy here. I study at Cal State Fullerton across the street, and I refuse to go to this location.< /Text>

Fraudulently slow internet, they slowing internet speed to take more money from customers.  It took 3 minutes to download 800KB(less than 1 mb) and print it.  I spend 5$ to print 1 funding page of text.< /Review>

<Review>Bottom of the barrel employees working there. Very rude and lazy staff. This location seems to make up their own policy thats different from what corporate Fedex follows. Always at least 5 employees working, yet always a line and when asking for help, will receive a rude attitude. I blame what seems to be the female manger who is in charger. She has very little communicate skills for being a manager.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is very convenient if you need to make copies, send emails,print something out or ship something. However customer service stinks.</review>

Whats the point of paying extra if they don't keep their word of when it will arrive. UPS or post office will be used next time. Ridiculous!<//Review>< pics>

Have me waiting 20 min to print pictures as i need help for thier  dysfunctional machine. And when i objected he said "I don't need to argue with you" as if I am not a customer asking for service. At the end I asked another person working there whom was a nice older gentleman and kindly he helped me to print my pictures.

I will send my complaint to their corporate as well cause this store  is in my neighborhood and i don't want every time i need service be treated with someone such as , Tin, an unprofessional unfit  rep not to mention manager!!!< /Review>< Rate>

I've been here several times and the customer service is so non existent I can't really even rate it. I have started driving much further because the people here have been really rude and never like to answer simple questions about shipping.</Review>

I have been to this FedEx office twice now, and so far I have been happy with the service and quality of prints. I'm a graphic design student and I frequent these places often to print projects, and have had my fair share of headaches with service and quality. I was happy when they said that they carried 12x18 cardstock paper, because the one by my house does not. The same guy helped me the two time I've been there and never game me any problems. Although, the first time I went, a lady who worked there wanted to send me to the self-service printers, when I refused because they take too long, this guy was happy to help me. I'll probably continue going to this one as long as the service continues to be as good as it has been.</Text>

Store associates are ok (some of them).
Shipping wise? Stay as far as possible from them.
A company that doesn’t take your business with them seriously then why should you.  If you gamble with FedEx, don't expect your package untill a week later than expected. Every breath they take towards shipping your package is a mistake that You will have to endure in agony.

It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't provide outbound shipping services, because they have never failed me or done me wrong  and if something does happen (rarely)  it doesn't go with out an immediate right.</text>

Less than 5 people in the store and 4 employees I could see.
After a few minutes someone finally said
" be right with you. "
5 more minutes standing there and I left for UPS where I was helped immediately< /Review>

Worst service ever. I had to use the self print machine because the person behind the desk didn't want to bother helping me. The concept of the self help copier is great. Unfortunately it is beyond slow and takes 10 min per print withiut the ability to select more then 1 file....not so fun when you have 8 pages to print. Would never come back.</text>

<user_name>Sukhraj Beasla (Suki)<//user_name><Review>Why can't every FedEx location be the same?? This place is nothing like my friendly Foothill Ranch location.

I came in to see a long line and about FIVE employees behind the counter talking amongst themselves and ignoring the line. I was there for 5 minutes waiting and wondering if I should leave and find another location until they finally decided to do their jobs and start working on the line.

When it came to me, the employee simply shrugged me off, gave me some brief instructions, and let me go. I was left to figure out what to do on my own but luckily I was ok and didn't need any help because I'm sure it would have just pissed me off and infuriated me even further. I won't be back. Next time, I need any of FedEx's services I'll find another location.</Review>< resp>

< Review>
This Kinko's has poor service! I sent in a picture to get color copied. They waited 2 hours to call me back to let me know it will cost me $8 to just make the size of picture 8 X 10.  This is the 8th time I have used this service and it has costed me 0.81 cents. Now they want $8 to size the picture. I can get a photo color copy for cheaper.  I work for a corporation which uses this Kinko's often. We will no longer use  this business.<//Review>

Whether you call, or walk in, you can guarantee yourself the worst Fedex Kinkos experience. It always takes a village to answer simple fedex questions, and together they unite in the same confusion and dysfunction. Poor experience in October via phone, and here I am months later doing it to myself again. I have to stop driving by and running in. The cashier is friendly. Oh, he's taking money!< /Text>

Lunch specials are great. Hot soup straight out the kitchen! Good way to get over a hang over it to just eat something not so heavy unless you want to, which they can also accommodate. Simple menu. Good place to go.<//Review>

an awesome restaurant.
nice service. roomy hall. clean tables and utensiles.

The beef soup is 16 dollars but is very worth it. we also had a yookgaejang and it was very tasty as well. The soups could be a little salty to some but overall they possess the taste of Korean braised soups.

I give 5 stars overall and highly recommend here for Koreans and others.< /review>

Come here so  many times and the food is always delicious and the staff is always friendly. Last night we ordered the bibimbap, bbq beef, and bone soup and it all came out sizzling and delicious. The food is so fresh and spices so flavorful. A comfortable neighborhood place with reasonable prices for the quality of the food provided.<//text>

They caused $1000+ worth of damage when installing on our new home, and I cannot so much as get a call back from any representatives to work on getting it fixed. I have called and email DOZENS of times. Considering filing a lawsuit if I do not hear back from anyone within the company.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd6ae503a365:0x8e526f346ac68724</Gmap_id>< username>

You should be allowed to give 0 stars. Trying to get a copy of the contract I was forced to sign. Told it would be 2 to 3 day's. 5 business day's later they tell me that they have to reorder the copy. I ask to speak to the manager and am I told they are in a meeting. No one knows when they will be available. The company is a joke.<//Review>

I cannot emphasize how unprofessional and uncaring this company is.  We bought our solar panels because it was required with our new house purchase.  After 2 months they barely produce.  The panels are shaded by neighbors house.  This company refuses to come out and look at panels; won’t see if panels are damaged; claims one day they will do a shade analysis but never do a thing about it.  Do not deal with this company.  Right now I am ready to deal with another solar company and get a refund of my $10,000 but this company won’t even give me a refund.  This really smells like construction defect to be.   I don’t know who to report this company too but I am ready to get a lawyer!!! Their customer service agents are total jerks!< /text>

Bought a brand new home & came with standard number of panels. Now that I live in it I need a couple of more panels in order not to have a True Up bill & called to inquire about adding more panels & they do not add more panels. They also do not have a battery in case the power goes out like other Solar companies. The woman I spoke to  said that if I want more panels I need to get a second system.
Also their website does not give really any information about them, their product, they have on their website that you can monitor from smart device but they do not give information on how or what app to use.
You can really tell this company is in the business for only the money & do not really care about customers. Since they have you hooked with the agreement when purchasing the home.< /Text>

My neighbor had to spend thousands to have all of the pigeon droppings cleaned out under their solar panels. If they had waited much longer, they would have to pay thousands more to reinforce their roof.

Not wanting to suffer the same costs, I reached out to SunStreet asking what they could do. Apparently, they do not care at all what happens to my house unless it affects their pockets in the form of reduced solar production. How great, greedy, and uncaring is that!?!? They even suggested I contact the builder for any roof issues! It's not the roof causing the issue, it's your solar panels!</Text>

No call back is exactly right. I need to shift the auto pay and login hasn't worked since they finally used https on their website and I've tried to reach them for months. Post a number for us to call, or something that results in good service.</review>

This place has the worst customer service! For 3 weeks and had spoken on many different calls along with emails to request pay off amount for our solar system. Legal team emailed the contract twice and not what I requested which was for the pay off amount. Legal team can’t be reached by phone and only by email. However, our refi on the house is on hold until we get this document that they are stalling. They also place a lien on our house. An absolute NIGHTMARE to deal with and unprofessional.</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>There were installation issues. I guess a couple of wires were crossed. It took them multiple visits by them and phone calls made by me for them to figure out the problem and make the repair. I am still not able to monitor my system. They will not reimburse me for the time the system was down. I am kind irritated by this. It was down for a mistake that their installation people made.</Review>< pics>

Just like everyone else - I was forced to use SunStreet as they are owned by Lennar and Lennar puts them on their homes.  We just bought a new Lennar home in Woodland CA and  I did buy my system and they charge a premium because - did I mention they are owned by Lennar!!!   They got the solar launched after about 2 months in the house - it is what it is.   Now the issues started to happen.  About 3 months in I noticed low production in 2 panels.  Called in and after 2 months, they finally got it fixed it with a software update.  Really - takes 2 months for software???   Now to today, we are 11 months in, now I found 5 of the 11 panels not working to full capacity.  I looked back and it had been going on for 2 weeks!  Guess what - if you buy the system - THEY DONT CARE AND DONT MONITOR YOUR SYSTEM.  If you Lease the system - They DON'T CARE EITHER - they don't have a performance clause in their contract.   Did I mention, they DON'T CARE.   Now I have to wait for the subcontractor who installed the system to come out and figure out what is wrong.   OH - if you want to add to the system - they don't offer that either.   So I was happy to go with someone else with a second system.   The second system is out producing the SunStreet System and was cheaper per KW.  If you have a choice - DO NOT USE SUNSTREET -  run - run very fast away from them.  Sorry fellow Lennar friends - you are stuck with a terrible company.< /Review>

<review>If you have the option, stay away from sunstreet. They were forced on me since I bought a new house and they have been terrible. I have been in my house for 3 months now and the solar still isn't activated. Who knows how much money im not saving due to their incompetence. It has been excuse after excuse. "We're waiting for pge",  weeks went by with no contact from them. I contact them and its "pge switched the account to you so you need to give us info" why not tell me that instead of leaving me in the dark?? Pun intended. I received an email saying there was something I never signed, so I tried to contact them. They never responded to my email and The main line gives me a busy signal every time I call. I finally had to get a management number from my mortgage agent and they told me that their records show that they don't need a signature. Weeks went by and I received another email from another sunstreet employee saying that theyre still waiting on a signature. I replied, but again weeks went by with no response back. I contacted management and again, was told no signature was needed and they're working on getting me activated. This company is a joke. If you're buying a house and sunstreet is the only option to be forced down your throat, consider buying elsewhere to avoid this nightmare of a company.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Friend buying a new house and they are the only provider for solar which is fine but they don't give you the option to finance the amount. It's either pay the full amount which is pricy or lease the product... That's really annoying that they don't give you the option to finance it especially when you're buying  a new house and need every penny.
They are also way over priced! My friend is getting 11 panels for $14K and I  got 24 panels for few thousand more...

Definitely do not recommend them.</Review>< pics>

<text>Once you signed up with SunStreet only phone calls you can make or allow is regarding your bills. If you need to talk to customer service "GOOD LUCK'
They will never answer the phone or return the call or email. Only thing they are interested is AUTO PAY.
If you think being on the phone with AT&T is long and hard try calling SunStreet.

For years now when trying to do a refinance they screw over their clients by taking too long to do the necessary paperwork that allows the home owner to refinance on time. Builders should be aware when choosing to put people in potential danger to lose their rate locks. They do not answer the phone or return phone calls either. Beware when this is the company that your builder is using. We will be sending reviews to the builder as well to warn potential home buyers because you do not have a choice if this company is chosen by your builder.< /review><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcdd6ae503a365:0x8e526f346ac68724</gmapID></record>

<review>I do not know how a company with this bad of service is even in business. You call them, they don’t answer, you ask for a call-back, they do not return your call, I had to call at exactly 7am to talk to someone and even then they could not fix my answer as to why the subordination on refinancing my home is taking so long. If you are buying a Home and this is the solar company you are dealing with, beware!

When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they said none was available.

Bottom line, never use this company! It’s the worst experience you’ll go through.</review>< name>

I would no recommend using it as you get 0 customer service from them and even more so they want more and more money for solar panels that depreciate the longer you lease them.< /review>< pics>

<text>Company is a ripoff. I never wanted to go with Sunstreet but was forced to because my brand new home came with their leased system. The amount of production I get from their array is laughable and offers no benefit at all. I owned the system at my previous home which I had oversized for my usage and it was the same price as Sunstreets asking price to buy out of their contract and their production is HALF of my previous solar array. The solar modules they used are a major downgrade from the ones I previously owned. My highest electric bill at my previous residence was $75 because we ran the AC 24/7. We don't use the AC as often here and we had a $385 electric bill AND have to pay Sunrun $50 a month for their useless undersized array. I would never have gone with Sunstreet had I the choice. If you want a system superior to theirs in EVERY way and at a much lower cost let me know. As a an electrician and a tradesman with integrity I could never knowingly force so many people into such a horrific contract.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>If I could if this company 0 stars I would. I bought a house and this company is only there to rip you off. I would not have ever bought this house under the program that we have. This company is FRAUDULENT. They said they had multiple conversations with my husband and couldn’t get ahold of me to tell me about their solar. They have never called my number once.  We have solar that we cannot benefit from because we did not buy the system when there are other solar companies who allow you to lease the system and still benefit from having solar. We pay just to have panels with no benefit which is a rip off. Their customer service is poor  and I feel blindsided.</Text>< Rating>

< review>
my solar system isn't even on-line and I am already having a bad experience, I got a Sunstreet leaflet hanging on my door knob, it said that my new home solar is now activated, so I tried setting on "My Sunstreet" on their website.  I had the most difficult time setting up my account (and of course I didn't).  I called into customer service and I talked to one of the rudest people I have ever spoken with.  I kept getting interrupted.  At the end I was explained that my system wouldn't be on-line for another month or so.  The company has the most confusing SOP for everything for customers and their customer service is unhelpful and rude.</review>

If I could I would not give any stars to this company. I am trying to get solar subordination for my property since I am refinancing. I paid them $250 on 5/29 and today on 6/29 I am still waiting for paper work. I call them talk to the reps and they apparently sends an email to someone who never responds. This company sucks. If you do not want to deal with this trauma take your business with somewhere else. I had bought a Lennar home and apparently this company had contact with them that is how I got sucked in. I probably will never buy another Lennar home.< /review>

Whatever you DO in life do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from these scam artists.
Do not buy anything from them!
They will ripe you off and you will never be able to get in touch with any of them.
They overcharge you and charge you $1 for a physical statement after that fact I have sent them at the moment 26 emails asking them to stop and 5 phone calls.<//Text>

<user_name>Jason Pico<//user_name><pictures>None< /pictures><Text>No problem with the use of solar energy. Performance wise, I think it is doing the job.
However when it comes to billing, some customer reps from this company is far from good.
It started when I noticed this service provider charge for paper billing. I told the rep this is rarely heard of, almost always customers are provided with paperless options and I always take it. but this time they told me they just do it regardless, as part of the deal in home purchase, besides, customers have no choice but to use the service for the next 20 yrs.
I have no problem using clean energy and the facilities installed to my home, but this particular service provider? made me sick.
Basically I was intimidated to follow whatever is in the paperworks I had signed when purchasing my home property.
I will have to go through my home builder/developer to resolve issue - Sunstreet customer rep dont seem to care about customers given that they are secured by the 20-yr contract.
Ridiculous.<//Text></record>

Horrible Place to deal with.  We have had an unresolved billing issue of 5 months now and they will not all us to speak to the accounting department.  We have sent in proof that the payment was made and cashed by them and must have been applied to the incorrect account.  If I could give zero stars that would be too high.  Absolutely no place for the client to resolve an issue.<//text>

<review>Not good communication and service.  We had been waiting for the power company to do their part and I was told by one SunsStreet to call and let them know when my power company switched out my meter.  I called to let them know and the individual I spoke to acted like I was being annoying and said she couldn't turn the panels on.  I was not asking her to turn the panels on. I was returning their call, as requested by the last associate who called me, to let them know the meter had been switched over.

Cory came out for my solar orientation today at my home. Was right on schedule. Very helpful in explaining the system and answering all my questions. I probably had more questions than the average customer and Cory was great taking the time to answer and promising to follow-up on questions he couldn't answer. Cory seems sincerely interested in helping the customer. That is great!!< /text>

Cory visited today to activate our solar panels. I had no idea what to expect, and he was informative, thorough, and answered all of my questions! He went above and beyond with a friendly demeanor, and tips about how to keep our children safe around the breaker boxes. He was sweet with our dog too! We look forward to partnering with Sunstreet and their awesome employees like Cory! Thank you!</Review>

Juvenal was scheduled to hook me up to my solar system today and as excellent. He called me to see if I was home because he was running early and when he did arrive the work was done quickly. He also took the time to give a tutorial on how to set up my solar monitoring system on the internet. Thanks!!</review>

<review>Cory came to our home for the solar installation.  He was friendly and very helpful in explaining what we have and how to interpret what we can expect with our new solar system.......hope for lots and lots of sunshine to help us generate more production and bring our overall energy bill down.  Thanks, Cory, great job!  I also really liked that SunStreet sent me an email with Cory's picture, so I knew who to expect.<//review>< pics>

Poor customer service. I’m in a forced contract with sunstreet and while they installed the panels, it’s never been activated. My power company says it’s been good to go for months now. Sunstreet won’t check on it. I’ve got useless panels on my roof< /Review>

Customer service is terrible. Our monitor device that we use to track our solar production went out. They won’t come out to get it working again ( even tho they are in the neighborhood all the time as they are still building new homes). They just refer you to instructions that don’t make any sense or don’t work as I’ve  tried many times. Haven’t been able to track my solar production in over 6 months because once sunstreet gets your money they don’t care. Go with Solar City if you have a choice.< /Review>

Everyone with  5 stars either had conversation about solar installation or friend to the names they are mentioning. when I first bought the house everyone was cordial and took their time to explain and at the beginning they lied by saying your MRC will not pass $75.00. I think it is time that all home owners should get together and eliminate sunstreet out of our neighborhood. Lennar found a company just like themselves to profit share the MRC of our solar panel. If I knew what kind of a company Lennar and sunstreet are, I would have never bought a house from Lennar.</review>

Husband called this morning simply to make a payment as we have been doing for past 2 years.  The billing dept employee had the worst attitude with husband.  Husband has it on speaker I heard girl scream “can you hear me now!”  Like omg I’m sorry you had a rough weekend    After that husband asked for her name to talk to supervisor about her attitude ...she hung up phone straight out!!!! Like is this a the way you conduct business ???   You left a terrible taste in our mouths !!
How dare someone shout at a customer!!!!!!!👎🏻< /review>

Sunstreet recently installed solar panels on our home.  Their administrative team did a great job of keeping us informed at each stage of the installation, inspection, and activation of the system.  At the end of the process, Cory from Sunstreet arrived and walked us through each of the system components and finalized our connection to the power grid.  He was courteous, professional, and informative.  We are very happy with the service and the follow-up.</review>

<text>After reading the reviews, yes, at first they give you great service because they want to activate your panels for their benefit. Sunstreet is owned by Lennar. If you refinance or do anything with your mortgage, Sunstreet will charge $250 as an admin fee for the subordination of the lien. This only applies if your on the “buying back the power” program. I just wanted to let everyone know that they will have you tied in to them one way or another. This is something they don’t tell you when you first sign up. I asked for a fee waiver. Their response was, NO. Just and FYI.< /text><time>1537559624011</time>< rating>

Horrible just simply horrible customer service...I have the panels on my house due to the no win situation with Lennar Homes in which you must get their panels. The service dropped out and they did not even know it or contact me.....I called them to ask where is my bill and it was like they were clueless. My SCE bill was huge also. Then after numerous attempt to solve problem they say they will call you back and they do not. After getting to correct person they blame it on SCE sending too high Voltage to my house. I check with SCE they test from the office and send someone out next day to check voltage ( great customer service) Voltage was fine. Now two weeks into this and Sun Street still not taking action guess they want another month I do not pay them and have to pay SCE the higher rates. I asked on the second day I contacted them to speak to a Supervisor they said they would put in that request I am still waiting going two weeks now to talk that person....I will not hold my breath. I have Solar City on my other house very very happy with them excellent customer service and if my system so much as burps I hear from them. horrible my rating would be negative stars if I could for Sun Street<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Juve came by today to activate my solar panel system with Sunstreet.  He arrived on time, answered all my questions and helped me set up some of the other apps connected to my wifi.  He did a great job, and I would recommend Sunstreet to anyone looking for a good solar panel system.<//review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Beware of ticks on your dogs. Found a tick on my dog’s face even though he was leashed. The tick must have got on him when he was sniffing a bush on the side of the trail. This park has barely any shade. It’s mostly exposed. Currently, the hills are green for now. It can get really hot in the spring and probably summer. There are some steep hills for hiking and a few nice views of the bay.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3y6YsjQoXKfCYI29UoDRazX57j2IVhHW0Mo2s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
There are a lot of trails you can enjoy. Great place for hiking, running, mountain biking and horseback riding. Some parts of the trails are steep, like the first half of Joice trail starting at Benal ranch, again Joice trail coming up from the east to Vista loop trail, Boundary trail near the Coyote Peak and the first half of Mine trail at Nored ranch . If you want thrill of MTB'ing, try the rocky ridge trail. Most of the trails have no shade, so you need sunscreen and lots of water. Sometimes you can see snakes, wild turkeys, dears along the trail. A couple of months ago, I spotted a group of wild boars.</Review>

There are several trails with beautiful views. We took Ridge Trail to Boundary Line Trail. It wasn't  crowded.< /text>

Great hiking area, if you hike in a bit, decent views of IBM Research and even Mt. Umunhum to the west and Mt. Hamilton to the East. Currently free to enter under Covid. Bathrooms and parking available.< /Review>

Great place to hike. Tons of parking. Even got to see some wild turkeys. Will definitely be doing Rocky Ridge next time. Great view at the top of the hill of the entire Bay Area.<//review>

<text>An unexpected surprise here. An Archery range with parking and great targets set up. The people who share this location are safe and respectful.  Was interesting to see a whole flock of wild turkeys that wander through in the afternoon before sunset. Just be sure to hold up when they pass by, no walking dinner from here!!!</text>< time>

Good trails and very nice views of San Jose. Sometimes there is a lot of foot traffic, and other times is quite lonely. You’ll see coyotes, bobcats, deers, and wild turkeys. Some trails are a bit steep, but are easy or moderate.</Review>

I hated this place because  this person in this picture is not able to experience this park.. to be honest I don't hate this spot at all. I kinda am fed up with the fires and the overcast weather. Humidity and ashes . It's like god has ashed  on us. I remember when you used to be able to drive threw this road and end up in almaden  valley . Definitely  a great cruise  to remember.  IBM influenced  technology And the history  of Bernal Family . A woman named Velma was what Bernal road was named after. Bet she never envisioned  computers and freeways in her family's path either did the cottles or ohlone natives. If your from here you should  remember that vehicle. It was hit by a drunk driver in an intersection  in Campbell.  Only for this young man to jump out and rescue the driver. But totalling this 1964 SS  Impala. Him and his family friends and associates from there have keen  respect for this area. And have a pride and love and appreciation  for  the neighbors of this area.  It would be nice to actually feel some understanding threw out and hear people's educated  opinions and or attitudes.  I'm good with that. ☆< /text>

<Review>Sherwood Forest, the Santa Clara County public archery range in South San Jose is perfect for beginners, veteran archery enthusiasts, and everyone in-between. Every time I go It's clean and the people there are friendly. I love it there.< /Review>< Rate>

Great neighborhood park in South San Jose. Open views of the valley, but exposed. Carry sunblock and plenty of water. Plenty of parking at the Pueblo Day use area centrally located to all trails.<//Text>

Come visit the Disc Golf Mecca of the world. I'd recommend carpooling as parking isn't the most abundant. Happy tossing 🤘✌️🤙🖖<//Text>

This is a great safe place to go hiking. If you have a dog you are able to bring them as long as they are on a leash. Luckily every Trail is easy to find and even easier to find your way back. The bathrooms are super clean and they are always stocked with paper towels, toilet paper, and hand soap. Last time I went the meter to charge for parking was down but keep in mind that you should have cash on you just in case the ticket meter is working again. Last time I checked used to be $6.<//text>

Well this time I was in the Southern part of the park, and it is not nearly as pleasant as the Northern part that you enter and pay a parking fee. Unfortunately, a lot of people come here to drink and smoke marijuana in their cars and they discard bottles on the ground. Be careful because there is a lot of broken glass and trash here. The Northern entrance is much, much better and has easy access to trails and has benches and nice trees to sit under. Go to the Northern entrance, yeah.</review>

Fantastic country park. For walkers, open meadows with fire roads. For Mtn Bikers, intermediate and advanced trails. Lots of wildlife and wildflowers to see.< /text>

A nice hike, not too long. There is not much shade towards the top of the peak, so be advised if you are hiking in the middle of the day. A great view of San Jose and beyond with a few benches at the top and a plank with some information.<//Text>

wildlife to photograph. I might go

<Review>Wow, the views are fantastic from Coyote.  The mountain biking in the park is very good.  Listed as intermediate to hard, it kicked my butt today on the Best of Santa Teresa 13+ mile route.

I had to walk many of the steeper rock gardens on the way up.  A total of over 2000 feet in elevation gain put a hurting on me!< /Review>< UserId.>

<review>This park is my neighborhood park, it's great for being so close to everything. Amazing mountain biking trails and there is even some scattered rock climbing over near the gold coarse. Nice place to picnic and allot of professional photographers take family pictures near the difference old farm equipment and barn as well as some of the medows when it's green.< /review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Consistently see several groups of deer walking about freely and unbothered. The park is not busy and often feels like no one else is there. Very clean and well maintained. Bit of a steep climb to get to if biking to it. The trails inside the park are optimum for mountain biking (not for road bikes).
Restroom is also very well maintained.

San Jose seriously needs to revisit their drone restrictions. This park is vast and would see more use if it were a drone friendly park.</Review>

Great park for everything. Riding bikes, walk or run. Long trails with great views. Wild life is all around. Stay alert pay attention and you will see more. Bobcats, Mountain Lions, Coyotes, Snakes, Birds, Deers and Boars are some of the highlights.<//review>

Wow, the views are fantastic from Coyote.  The mountain biking in the park is very good.  Listed as intermediate to hard, it kicked my butt today on the Best of Santa Teresa 13+ mile route.

I had to walk many of the steeper rock gardens on the way up.  A total of over 2000 feet in elevation gain put a hurting on me!<//Review>

I spend a great deal of time here.
Today Bob and I did maintenance on both mowers, now we're ready to tackle the grass & weeds. The archery range is looking great, with all the improved target butts. Thanks mainly to a hand full of dedicated members, doing most of the upkeep & maintenance. Best range in the area!</text>

<review>Absolutely amazing county park in the heart of Silicon Valley with a diverse network of trails overseeing the valley and adjoining Santa Teresa Golf Course. This park is incredibly accessible for most San Jose residents via Bernal Road and is a great way to get back to nature and escape the everyday hustle and bustle of city life. The trail up to Coyote Peak is quite challenging but offers those who make it to the top a majestic view all the way to San Francisco on a clear day. One of my favorite Bay Area parks by far.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I lived with in walking distance to this park, I was able to find parking outside the park, sometimes it gets busy and you would have to park at the curb.
It would take me about 1.5 hours to do my usual hike. You will find small deer, turkeys, boars, quale, rattle snakes, etc.
At the entrance they have a spot with a map and information about the type of wild animals you can encounter. They have pamphlets that come with a map and information you can take.
They also provide hiking sticks it's a first come first serve.
I would totally recommend it!< /text>

Bring sunscreen. Overcast today? Bring sunscreen anyway. Zero shade. Solid mountain biking spot in an area that otherwise doesn't have many rocks to speak of. Not the best place for beginners.</review>

Great park for everything. Riding bikes, walk or run. Long trails with great views. Wild life is all around. Stay alert pay attention and you will see more. Bobcats, Mountain Lions, Coyotes, Snakes, Birds, Deers and Boars are some of the highlights.</Text>

Great place with many hiking trails. I usually start my hike at camden ave/harry road near ibm to make my hike longer. Limited parking on fortini where bikers/hikers usually begin. Any park is a good park to hike; we're lucky to have so many places!! Happy trails!!<//text>

Stunningly beautiful and a great place to get away from the hustle of SV.  Dogs are welcome on leash. However, expect your animal and possibly you to bring home several ticks and fleas. There are also quite a number of foxtails growing along side the trails.<//Review>

This park is a nice place to go hiking and mountain biking. Sometimes you will see deer, turkey, or quail around this area. There many also be snakes on the trail. Be careful as they may attack you if you get too close. I try to leave a good distance when walking past them. They will simply slither away if you do so. In the spring, there is a variety of different wildflowers. Sometimes the flowers will be in big patches. Sometimes there will be nice sunsets in the park also.</Review>

<text>Went to the Black Mountain Bowmen range. Great range and it's all maintained by volunteers! The other archers are very courteous and obey normal range rules (no arrows whizzing by my head when I go pull). Nice and quiet, and I've seen tons of wildlife too!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>A beautiful park with great views all around. very nice and peaceful. Well maintained. Watch out not to step on a tarantula, they are often found on the trails and fire roads here and do no harm, so just let them be. This is a rattle snake territory so watch your dog carefully and jog with caution, they will be quiet and will not attack if you just pass them by and pose no threat.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

A large county park with numerous walking/ bike trails. Nice vistas of Santa Clara Valley, depending on the trails you take. BBQ pits, water faucets and large covered seating area. Restrooms near by. Wildlife... Turkeys, deer, wild pig, coyote and rare mountain lion. Dogs allowed but on leash. (They may chase wildlife so keep on leash, coyote and boar not to be messed with! Mountain lion info near restrooms) Good parking. Ticket kiosk, per car, near entrance. Outdoor movies shown in summertime.<//text>

<text>Lots of great trails with a range of difficulty. Depending on the season one can expect to see a waterfall, streams or desert like conditions. There are some great views and the park merges with Bernal Ranch Park. There are some good mountain bike trails too. The Rocky Ridge Trail looks like a moonscape, can be tough by foot or bike but a cool experience. Lots of wild life in the park, deer, coyotes, turkeys, wild boar and mountain lions too.<//text>< username>

< review>
Santa Teresa is my favorite park in San Jose. The park occupies a sizable area and has a fair amount of trails for hikers, bikers, and horse riders. The highest point in the park (Coyote Peak) offers a nice view of San Jose (but be prepared for the steep climb, especially if you're biking there.)

Santa Teresa is usually not very crowded, even on weekends. Weekdays are especially nice for those who enjoy activities like animal and bird watching, or a lone bike ride.

Unlike many other parks, leashed dogs *are* allowed here (but please, make sure your dog is on a leash!).The park also offers (clean) public restrooms and a large covered area which can be reserved for parties.

For mountain bikers, the park offers a wide range of biking trails, ranging from almost flat and easy to rocky and technical. No matter how experienced you are, you can always create a route that will get you entertained (and tired).

The only thing I miss in this park is a large body of water. There are a few seasonal streams running through the park, but no lakes.

The parking lot is fairly large, and parking was $6 last time I checked. Rangers do check the place and will give you tickets if you don't pay the parking fees or park your car on the road.</review>

Santa Teresa Park is an amazing park for long walks, hikes, dog walks, and more. There's amazing views of San Jose once you get higher up. Tons of free parking. Can't find anything bad about this place!!< /text>

Santa Teresa Park is an amazing park for long walks, hikes, dog walks, and more. There's amazing views of San Jose once you get higher up. Tons of free parking. Can't find anything bad about this place!!<//Review>

Nice park well maintained. When you arrive there is a parking permit requirement. $6.00 daily. If you are throwing a big party. There is a spot for reservations. It has benches and a huge grill. The locations are spread out and the other spots are first come first serve basis.< /text>

<text>This is one of my favorite parks.  We hike, walk our dog, and mountain bike here regularly.  It's a great place for exercise, and you can easily get 2000 feet of mountain bike climbing in 8 miles of riding, with hills left over in case you have anything left over!  After rains the trails are muddy with soft clay and unsuitable for mountain biking (and sometimes a pain for hiking), and I wish they posted trail closures online.  The views are fantastic.<//text><time>1358618755430</time><Response>None< /Response>< Pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>The park is very poorly marked as being closed when it is. Retracing my steps to where I came in at the free parking lot, there was only one sign that would have notified of the closure that had been grafittied over heavily.

Maybe post trail closures at the base entrance instead of having militant rangers threaten citations? Seems like a pretty simple solution.
I can't be a law abiding citizen if it's not clear to me that I am not being so.

Beautiful park, Rocky Ridge is great.<//Review><time>1521150624830< /time><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

<Text>I love this park. There is a $6 entrance fee. There are quite a few picnic sites and trails for hiking. If you are lucky you might meet a coyote (I did twice so far). Beautiful views from the tops.<//Text>< Name>

Santa Teresa County Park is a nice hiking and mountain biking destination. However, all the trails are completely open to the elements, be they rain, or shine, so one must be well prepared when coming out here.< /Review>

Beautiful in the spring and well marked. Grab a map if it's your first time so you can navigate. Keep an eye out for bobcats, there are tons eating the birds around the golf course.<//Text>

Decent hike. The trails are mostly wide and easy with some views of the city but the scenery is mostly bland. Lots of mountain bikes but they shared the trails well. Lots of cows near the trails in some areas.</Text>

One of my favorite parks. Has a bit of everything you might want: Good hiking trails, friendly to horses (I don't ride a horse), friendly to pets (many parks won't allow them), very nice for mountain biking (has trails ranging from very easy to difficult) and is not so far.</text>

So beautiful, whether the weather is sunny or overcast. Super green in the spring, and seemingly endless trails. Watch out for bikers if you're on foot, though, the pathways are often narrow which requires hikers to step off the path when a bike comes through</review>

< Review>
Zaxby at the golf course at Santa Teresa they always do a side job and that seems to flow seems to keep moving and they courses always in effective shape I'm thinking you know it's a little bit pricey for muni golf but it's California and golf is expensive here. I specially like the back nine.<//Review>

<review>This county park was an amazing place to drive through and watch leaves fall during Autumn. I once watched a tree fall around here, but i didn't hear it make any sound, probably because my windows were up. So i imagined it making a noise close to something like -crackssshhhh-crashhhh-aaaahhhh-oooowwwwww~!!!!!!!</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

Scenery on the trails is pretty lacking, but I like the difficulty here. Trails are moderately shady. It's a county park, so parking is $6.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Come to Santa Teresa County Park, located ten miles south of downtown San Jose in the Santa Teresa Mountains. This 1,673-acre park has a rich history and spectacular views from the trails above the Almaden and Santa Clara valleys. The secluded highland valley of the park provides a quiet episode for exploring the natural surroundings of the surrounding developed areas. Santa Teresa County Park is located at the southern end of Santa Teresa. The park can be accessed from the Alma Mountain Valley or Santa Clara Valley. From the Santa Clara Valley, take the US 101 or 85 motorway to the Bernal Road exit. Drive 1.3 miles west along Bernal Road and cross Santa Teresa Avenue to Santa Teresa. Bernal Road continues through the park's Santa Teresa Golf Club and enters the hills. Located on Bernal Road, Pueblo Day Use Area is set in a small open valley on a hill.

來到聖特雷莎縣公園，該公園位於聖何塞市中心以南十英里的聖特雷莎山。 這個佔地1,673英畝的公園擁有豐富的歷史，從Almaden和Santa Clara山谷上方的小徑可以欣賞到壯觀的景色。 公園幽靜的高地山谷為探索周圍發達地區的自然環境提供了一個安靜的插曲。聖特雷莎縣公園位於聖特雷莎山的南端。 公園可從阿爾馬登山谷或聖克拉拉谷進入。 從聖克拉拉谷（Santa Clara Valley）出發，沿US 101或85號高速公路前往Bernal路出口。 沿伯納爾路向西行駛1.3英里，穿過聖特雷莎大道前往聖特雷莎山。 伯納爾路繼續穿過公園的聖特雷莎高爾夫俱樂部，蜿蜒進入山丘。 Pueblo Day Use Area酒店位於Bernal Road路旁，坐落在山丘上的一個小型開放式山谷中。<//review>
