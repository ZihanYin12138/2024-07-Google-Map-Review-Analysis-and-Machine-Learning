Grey haired guy was sitting there and playing the guitar behind the counter the whole time. I didn’t wanna interrupt him waited for him to be helpful but he kept playing. I said thank you as I am walking outta store he didn’t even say nothing. I Would never be back again for sure.

What’s problem with those people who works at the music stores. :)

<rating>5<//rating><text>I came in today for a setup for a Carvin and played around while I waited.  All I can say is wow!  Not a big store but full of great stuff.  Lots of unique models the big box stores don’t stock or have on hand, a literal pile of great tube amps, some I haven’t heard of before but now want...oh well.  Nothing at Sam Ash or Guitar center approaches the quality selection by folks truly dedicated to music like these folks.

The Staff was great, hard working, patient, attentive, knowledgeable and went the extra mile.  Also something missing in a big box.

Now the crazy part.  Prices are better than the big box and your shopping local and getting WAY better service.

Head over to Top 40!</text>< Pictures>

Went in yesterday and bought a PRS.

Absolutely love it! Especially the floating trem.

Gentleman named Brandon helped me.

He was very polite and patient while I test ran the instrument.<//Text>

<Review>I had been shipped a very awesome Epiphone Riviera P93 in the mail, and sadly, it arrived completely shattered at the headstock down the neck. I was devastated, and on a whim, called Top 40 to see what they could do. Without batting an eye, Brandon agreed to take a look, and accepted the challenge.

About 2 or 3 weeks later, I go to pick it up, and I was blown away buy how masterful and clean the repair was.

I am also buying an amp from him, and will continue to frequent his business.

Outstanding!< /Review>< pictures>

Also, where can you get a quality guitar setup done for under $60 in the SAME day? Look no further. Great store, great service and some of the best prices on brand new gear that I've seen.

Awful "service", no offer to help and when I asked he would just say yes or no,  they also  need to stock up on acoustics because they only had about two different brands. It looks like a spot for people that know each other in the area. One star for him saying goodbye.
I went down south at Pitbull Audio  to buy my guitar and it was a major difference!

To response: I would call it basic standards. As there was no service.<//Text>

I'm not a musician. But my husband and one of our sons is. I love this store because its it's well laid out. There seems to be a full range of Fender and Jackson guitars, I didn't look in the acoustic room. It's easy to find their packs of strings, effects peddles, amp heads amps, and everything else a guitarist needs. The staff is friendly, they have an online store in addition to the brick and mortar store.

Plus they offer a service where they will find the exact guitar you are looking for. They have access to buyers that procure guitars all over the country. (This sounds like a cool job)  Which is nice because it's like Car Finder for guitarists.

My son loves their selection of Fenders. He's been playing guitar since we bought him a Squire (kid sized Fender Strat) as a kid so he likes to see what's available in the Stratocaster section.

My husband hasn't made it over here yes, but I'm sure he will enjoy this store too.</Text>

The only place I'll ever take my SG to. Brandon at the front is very helpful, if he can't help you he'll direct you to somebody who can. Great prices and a great selection of guitars. Never had a bad setup or service. Everything 10/10< /Text>

<review>Had the neck of my electric guitar fixed, the results are amazing, can't even see where the fracture was. Excellent looking shop, has acoustics, drums, assorted guitars and music production equipment.  I enjoy the personable interaction with the shop staff. Best experience when compared to the other super music centers.</review><GmapID>0x80dbe29fc6b2f6bb:0x69676fba88b3d52c<//GmapID>< user>

<review>I stopped by on a whim and found  the Telecaster that I had been searching for. They sold it for 17% less than the big box guitar store. They have a wonderful selection of guitar amps and all at discounted prices. Wish I had known about Top 40 Guitars sooner. I'll be coming back.

This seller was just terrible. One of the worst experiences ever with an internet sale. The guitar arrived with issues that made it unplayable. He was truly a pain to deal with on the return. He threatened a restocking fee requiring that I get the listing agent involved. Once the guitar was recieved I had to reach out to him again for the return. He then made a point to send me an unprofessional message. I was a repeat customer and will never buy from this seller again!  My advice go elsewhere. There are lots of professional shops out there to chose from. Who needs hassles like this!< /Text>

I went to the store to see some amplifiers that were advertised on Craigslist. When I got to the store NONE of the equipment was available in the store. It had all  been sold.  Very lame business practices… I will never be back!!!

*follow up....Besides NOT having either the cabinets or heads as advertised, there were NO heads at all.  The ads were still up at 10:00am when I left for the store.  The ads were only canceled after I arrived. Poor business practices as I said earlier. Good prices for merchandise not in the store???  Hahaha.<//review>

< review>
An absolutely beautiful lake nestled in the Sierra National Forest, within an hour's drive North of Fresno. The lake is surrounded by a verdant forest of pine within the Sierra National Forest.

The lake offers, BBQing, fishing, boating and other watercraft activities, kayaking, paddleboarding, picnicing and hiking.

Just a short drive away is the cozy mountain community of Shaver, with a host of areas to eat and play.

The lake gets very crowded during the summer, so go early to secure a good parking place.</review>

We had the best experience ever; we rented a cabin that slept 10 guests. We had a blast! We went during the winter season. The place is fantastic😁😁👌🏼👌🏼<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><review>This is the perfect Escape summer or winter time, from the stress from day-to-day living in Fresno. Just a short drive takes you to amount escape with excellent weather great food and amazing views. The drive alone is peaceful and worth the effort. Rolling Hills horses livestock the countryside all beautiful. Once you get to the mountain you see sweeping views of the city behind you and as you go higher up you'll find great hiking trails and the Beautiful Lake. During the winter the snow parks are a must. During the summer seasons we like to pick Nick up here and walk around the different neighborhoods admiring the beautiful cabins. The local Shaver Lake Market makes the best monkey bread! You can't miss it it's on the main 168 Highway what you get to Shaver Lake you have to try it.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Gods country. Always a great time with Central Valley Adaptive Sports at Shaver lake. Although I have never rented a boat from the marina I hear the prices are great and the boats are well-maintained. Great parking near the marina.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Seems a little crowded for small town lake with limited resources and  the Highway Patrol keeps closing the road to get there so it's always a gamble getting there.</Text>

This is a great mountain lake that doesn't require the extended drive time that the other lakes in the area do.  There are many trails around the lake and the lake is quite popular for fishing and boating.  I would highly recommend a visit for anyone who enjoys outdoor activities.</text>

Shaver Lake is the best lake in Fresno County.  The water is clean & refreshing.  The scenery is really nice compared to other lakes with nice green mountains surrounding all sides.  The lake also does not get that busy so there is plenty of room for boating, fishing & fun.  Come & enjoy<//Review>

Pretty lake but still low enough that water can be decent for swimming. Had a.bee sting issue. That wasn't good..good place for.drive in areas. Great for boating. Can get busy. Make sure you oark fully off the road to avoid a big ticket.< /text>

Love this place! Definitely a place to unwind and relax. The water can be cold at times as expected due to elevation. If you get a chance, you should check out the annual black pot Festival held on the first Saturday of August every year. They put on a good firework show for the 4th of July as well.</Text>

<Text>One of the best camping areas we have been to. Beautiful forest, quiet and abundant if daily activities. The lake is pretty large it allows for all kinds of watersport asactivities. One can rent equipment from couple of marinas and spend the day in the lake. The water is refreshing and just the right temperature to cool down on a hot summer day. The camp site are very well organized and offer plenty of shade areas. There is electrical plug for each site. The bathrooms and showers are clean and well maintained. Stores and the village are conveniently close by too.<//Text><Time>1499476153697</Time>< response>

<Text>Great little park honoring veterans. Fun places for the little ones to climb, swing and play. Large lawn for nearly endless running.

Sad memorial for Mary Quigley who was murdered here in 1977.<//Text>< Pictures>

Cool little park. Small park. Only a few swings and once slide. Was kinda hidden by some school. Mot much shade. Was hot and had to cool down play area so my son wouldn't burn. Was a clean park. Overall it's a decent park.</Text>

<review>Fun and creative playground with all of the amenities you expect as far as swings, slides, climbing structures, bathrooms, etc, but with such a fun ant theme, including an ant hill, which makes the extensive sand areas even more fun.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Darlene Trevino at Prestige Law Firm is one of the most Kind-hearted people I had the pleasure of meeting. I reached out to her in hopes that she could provide some legal advice! After explaining my situation to her, unfortunately couldn't help me. My issue was more workman's comp, then personal injury. However, not once did she interrupt me while going over my issue. I'm sure she knew from the beginning, that I needed a workman's comp lawyer, but she listened anyway. Although she couldn't help me, she made sure to point me in the right direction and put me in contact with someone who could. In my opinion that shows the type of person she is, she is willing to help people in any way she can! She is definitely someone that will make sure you are taken care of!!! :)< /Text>

I love this whole Team!  Yadira was careful to explain every step of the process with me, and Attorney Darlene is EASY TO REACH!!!  That is important to me, because a case can be a little much!  Thankful for a team that actually cares.  Highly recommend this firm!<//Review>

Paul is an amazing personal injury attorney!!!   He works each and every case with absolute laser focus.  He is someone you can trust your friends and family too, as we do.

The staff always greets you by name and with a smile.  They do all the work for you so you can sleep at night without the stress of dealing with the pain of the insurance companies.

He has mastered his craft as an attorney and this has greatly benefited his clients!</Text>

<Review>Darlene Trevino and the Prestige Law Firm in the Antelope Valley represent everything you would desire in a personal injury Law Firm. From intentional personal care to fighting for you when it matters most. I highly recommend you make them your second call if you experience an auto accident, dog bit or a slip and fall (non-work comp related). You will not regret calling them immediately after dialing 911!<//Review><Response>None<//Response><date>1571105079909< /date>< pics>

I was so unsure about the process and had thought it was gonna be difficult. Thanks to Darlene she took care of everything and made it really easy on me very informative always stayed in contact with frequent updates If I ever for any reason hopefully not have to go through a case she’s the person I’m going to first and I would recommend her to anybody.<//Text>

Great sunglasses, great service. They have lots of other nice clothing options and gear to boot. I have one sweat shirt that I love wearing around the house in the winter. Oakley has this new technology called PRIZM for their sunglasses, and have a different PRIZM for each activity, from sports to boating. AND, they are the coolest looking glasses too.</review>

Tonight I brought my fiancee in so she could get her first pair of Oakleys, and both staff members jumped in on request to help with finding frames she liked and looked good on her,  matching them with lenses she liked, and making her feel great about the whole process. At the end of it, she said she finally understands why since I first deployed in 2008 and as a civilian, I've never worn anything else.< /review><Date>1580368225600<//Date>< Rating>

I love how friendly the staff is and how willing they are to help you. Everyone who served in the military knows Oakley. They have shoes, backpacks, clothes and yes even sunglasses and go in and check it out for yourself< /text>

Best service possible, bought new lenses and they also replaced a complete pair which the insurance company would not. This just made me love the bran even more.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I love the glasses but I do not give them five stars because the price is still expensive but good the good costs

<rate>3<//rate><review>We've been several times before always had good service, but last night was different. When the waitress asked "what do you want". It was odd. Then she took the order of the people that came in after us before ours. She was overwhelmed.  The lady from the ice cream side came over to help out. We could see they were trying there hardest to keep up. My husband was told by the waitress that management had seen on the cameras they were not busy and sent the other two employees home.  We went around 7:30 PM. The restaurant was getting packed as we were leaving. I hope management learned a lesson.  I will return, but hopefully next is drama free. The food did come out in a timely manner and was delicious.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp5d09JKDgG8lF20LWxJfzwk_BMphxWcMkv3i0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<text>This place had horrible customer service. We went there today and I had the fish and chips. The fish was not flavored and fries were not even crunchy. My husband got the torta Mexican and meat was good just everything else lacked flavor. My son had the sushi, kept it safe and got the california roll and he didnt like it at all. Will not be comming back. We waited for 10 min for service after we were done and nothing. We had to get up there and ask for the check.< /text><user_name>Jessica Speairs< /user_name>< pics>

<text>I just went to eat at this place, they served my kids’ food and forgot my order.  When we remained the waitress that we’re still waiting for our food and hour later and after seeing that people that got there after got their food, we decided to cancel our order. The waitress said, no need to do that it’s just tostadas, they’ll be right out.  That just bothered me even more.  No apologies were given or and offer to treat us with a discount based on the bad service  provided.  I’m never going back to this place again.</text>< Pictures>

< review>
Just went here today Sunday March 30 and this place was surprisingly busy but understaffed. The guys helping us and everyone else was taking orders, cleaning tables, cashing people out. He was hustling. The manager was some Hispanic lady with long black hair all she came out to do was bark out orders to him and let him know things he had missed. It’s like excuse me why don’t you come out and help him more instead. Girl nobody cares about your lip fillers or what you look like. The bathrooms were gross the women’s restroom had throw up in it for over an hour when we left it was still there. When you wait to go to restroom there is a door way with no door and you can see into the kitchen. Only one cook lady wearing no gloves she also touched the garbage can wiped down her station and then touched the food without washing hands!!!! She continued to make an order gross!! They had their crab meat for sushi out with no refrigeration. They had so much food out with no refrigeration. Food in Tupperware that they were using to cook with. This place was simply gross. My favorite part is when a customer went up to the lady with long black hair that was clearly the manager and was telling her something about her order and that manager lady replies “usted aquí alegándome de su orden mientras yo estoy tratando de ayudar ha esta gente aquí.” Translated she said your over head complaining about your order to me while I’m trying to help these people. I died of laughter. I can’t how does she even run this place. I do not recommend and their food is over priced! The sushi has more rice then filling. Almost $20 for one roll! There ceviche was too spicy for my liking and also almost $20. Overall not worth wasting your time or money coming here. I will be spreading the word and will NEVER return. But shoutout to the waiter you were doing 5 peoples jobs!< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) As they specialize in Sinaloa-style sushi and the truth is not good at all, neither the sushi nor the sauce has flavor, if you really want to try something good I recommend El Camarón de Sinaloa in Redwood City CA in case you one day pass by.

Según se especializan en sushi estilo Sinaloa y la verdad no esta nada bueno, no tiene sabor ni el sushi ni la salsa, si quieren probar algo bueno de verdad yo recomiendo El Camarón de Sinaloa en Redwood City CA por si algún dia pasan por ahí.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I just went to eat here they forgot my order. They served several people before me and didn't even bother to apologize after wasting my time. I will not stop in this place again.

Acabo de ir a comer aqui olvidaron mi orden.  Le sirvieron a varias personas antes que yo y ni siquiera se molestaron en disculparse despues de perder mi tiempo.  No vuelvo a pararme en este lugar.<//review>

<Text>Lucky's is a great food location while only have been for breakfast and lunch they do have a great brunch on the weekends as well. The menu is great and the food is delicious. Always good service as well. A bit expensive, flavors worth trying for a special occasion or sharing plates if price is and issue. Overall recommended if one enjoys high quality food and cocktails and  doesn't.mind paying extra for the nice experience.</Text>< pics>

Mangement was super friendly and attentive.  This was my first visit and just for a quick to go order. I was welcomed with a smile and given special treatment right off the bat. Soufflé to go?  Sure why not!  Thanks guys, looking forward to return for s proper sit down.</Text>

I really liked Lucky's. The Matzo Ball soup was incredible and my kid's hot dog was amazing. The steak (aged NY strip) was cooked to the perfect temp but for me, fell slightly short of expectations in terms of flavor given the price and that it was dry aged. Still, I'd gladly go back here for another meal - probably lunch.< /Text>

I very rarely eat meat but when I do, I want to make sure it’s top quality. This is what we found at Lucky’s. It’s definitely not the most affordable steak house but the value is great if you’re looking for high quality and great service.< /Text>

<review>this was a disappointment. I was there this evening to celebrate my Birthday. Last night my friend dined at the El Encanto Belmond. I have had several milestone birthdays up on the Rivera. Sadly, luckys fell short. Far short. My friend offered to take me to the Miramar where we were out walking the gardens, but I wanted to try luckys. I have lived in Santa Barbara 27 years and never been. We had reservations. The gentleman Paul who is the valet I give 5 stars to. After that it is all downhill. The young woman who was supposed to be our server was remiss. Remiss in all kinds of ways. She did not have a lot of tables as we are still not at max capacity. When you are having a pc of steak you could get at lazy acres for about 35 dollars for 75 you expect as my friend said, some pampering. Some attention, some well come back and ask how it is and not how is your steak when it has been in front of you less than two minutes. When we were done with no follow up asking, would we like more sparkling water? Would we like coffee, dessert etc. but rather after having to flag her down 3 times, wanting to know will that be all? No actually I think I will leave a review. The food was ok. Small portions with nothing on the side. You order a 75-dollar steak that is what you get. The coffee I have to request came out cold and tasteless with cold milk. It is always a sign of serious high marks when they heat the milk and like I told my friend, we were not eating at Denny’s. So, you get low marks particularly for not training this woman to be better. To actually excel. We sat out in the street with some bizarre metal plate that every single time someone walked across it sounded like a freight train and felt like a 4.0 earthquake. Paul, however, the valet was attentive and very personable, and my friend gave him a generous tip. She tipped what I can only describe as a bad waitress well even though she deserved none. I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants from here to Paris, New York City, Tokyo and this is not a five start restaurant. I am sorry I suggested this place especially on a special occasion.</review>< pictures>

I rank this place 12 outta 10 to start. Everything they make is 5 stars. Every detail is planned to the T and executed flawlessly. We went for my bro's 50th bday and had a blast with the 10 of us. I feel [lucky] to have been able to be a part of the celebration with those people I really care about at such a classy place. I highly recommend Lucky's to anyone who has a palate for great food, whatever your taste!<//review>

The food was good. I had the filet mignon special and it was tender and very tasty.
Biggest drawback was the fact that our other main, the rib chop special... wasn't special. They clearly forgot that we ordered the special so it came out plain and when we mentioned it should have been the special,  they brought out cool chunks of butter/flavor to put on the steak which in no way match what it should have been.
And for being in a big wine area, the bottle we got was good, but the vintage was wrong versus what the menu said. We mentioned it to the server but didn't want to make a huge deal of the whole thing. They listened but pretty much dismissed the fact that it was the wrong vintage, off by four years, which is a terrible look in my opinion.
Overall, these weren't mistakes that ruined a meal, but the lack of any sort of acknowledgement was off putting. When you go to this calibur of restaurant, you expect better.< /text>

The food was great 👍 but I have to say that I couldn't help but feeling that my wife and I had been placed in a corner in the rear of the restaurant by the restrooms like they used to treat blacks, whites eat in the restaurant & colored in the rear away from the whites. I truly tried to ignore the feeling but it was my birthday 🎂 and my wife wanted to take me to a what she felt was an upscale 5 star 🌟 establishment. I don't know if we're going to return & all other black Americans beware 🤔</review>

One of my fav restaurants! I ordered beef brisket with extra meat on the side. It seems like the amount of meat you get for one soup got smaller.  Overall, it tastes good.< /Text>

During the past few months we have ordered take out from Lucky's several times a week.  The last time we ordered one of the drinks we ordered just didn't taste "right."  When I called to mention this, Leonard, the General Manager told me "if you don't like the drinks don't come here.   As a matter of fact, do me a favor and never come here again."</text>

<Text>Absolutely horrendous experience at Lucky’s by the manager Leo and the hostess at Lucky’s montecito CA, location. We went for desserts at about 8pm without reservations, and hindsight should have made the reservation, but the attitude of the manager Leo was so rude and told us that we could not be accommodated even though there were atleast 5 tables open, This is unbelievable from a joint of this so called “caliber” and class!
@Lucky management, this is more about the service and attitude to handle a busy evening and the ability to manage all guests to not make them feel so small. It’s probably a power trip For them but service and attitude schooling is needed for the staff at Lucky’s Bar.<//Text><user_id>118004616337052423158<//user_id><Time>1597898421543<//Time>< Rate>

<text>Bread choice is strange. Almost like eating a crouton. Steak was ok, needed more seasoning for my taste. The seer on the outside could have been better. My wife’s steak was cooked medium well instead of the medium rare she asked for. I’ve been to better steakhouses for less $$.<//text><rate>2<//rate>< pics>

< review>
I took a chance and ordered their Vegetarian burger.  It tasted like a big juicy beef burger. It was amazing, we went for my friend's 30th birthday.  She got the prime rib and loved it.  My husband also opted for the Vegetarian burger. He also ordered the warm goat cheese and spinach salad. It was divine.
We also started with the grilled artichoke, the spicy aioli sauce was just the perfect amount of kick for the tastebuds. All the side dishes are served family style and they make enough to be shared with 2 people.  The Cauliflower Au Gratin, was a side special for the evening, and so I ordered those, they were delicious.  We ended with dessert, they gave her a sundae on the house and we ordered the mix berry shortcake and it had market fresh berries with a light cream, and lemon zested biscuit.  All in all it was an experience and it was wonderful.  Would highly recommend again.< /review>

I love to cook.... and I have to tell you that  this dinner was amazing. We have been here a month from St Louis.... have been to many dinners in Santa Barbara but I seriously adored my dinner..  Our server was so sweet and courteous...I just assumed the portions would be tiny for the special menu but not only were they ample but each course was excellent.... I ordered the Luckys salad with greens, avocado, tomato, haricot verts,  bacon and shrimp..... it was absolutely perfect and delicious....... then I ordered a pork chop .... it was 2” thick and cooked to perfection....dessert was apple crisp.... homemade.... warm and topped with ice cream...divine..... I was very very impressed with everything.... and I will go back for their regular menu....and I loved the ambiance....< /Review><Response>None</Response><name>Nancy Rose</name>< UserId.>

Never assume! My mistake was to imagine that this steakhouse located in a prime location on Coast Village Road in Montecito would offer an excellent meal. The restaurant was divided into 3 layers, an exterior, interior and a rear cozy space which I quite liked. The disappointment began with the menu offerings. The fare was quite common when compared to fine dinning restaurants at a similar per meal price point. The steaks, prime rib etc. were easily twice the price of better establishments. Not knowing better we made our selections and ordered. We assumed the price would be commensurate with its quality. Unfortunately this was not to be the case, gristly $75 steaks with $15 baked potato and $19 broccolini! Wow nothing special for the exorbitant price, no quality or sense of fine dinning what so ever. The service was quite mediocre and so was the attention to basic sanitation. When we asked our busybody to wrap up a portion of left over steak he said yes of course and then sloppily placed a used dish on the steak. When I saw this happening I reminded him that we had wanted to take it home. He said of course. It was unbelievable. The food that night was not horrible, it was only average but enormously disappointing for the price. The food quality and service was no better than what I imagine one would expect at a Coco’s or Denny’s.< /Text>

Superb filet and excellent service. The only criticism is the Brownie Sundae dessert. It's not a brownie, but a very rich flourless chocolate square. Good, but not what I was expecting.</text>

The food is good for sure.. Love the music and the vibe. This place is great for people watching! I go occasionally with my friends for that very reason. Always the same crowd at the bar. The big Afro-American man that pretends to have money that hits on women but he's married, the southern gentleman that if he gets drunk enough will tell you how easy it is to pay college girls to have sex with him. The over dressed guy who is so full of himself, the women are interesting too, the older anorexic women who orders food ,but picks at it ,the women with the long wig who always sits at the bar with her boyfriend. Then there are the really old men that come in with younger women that have so much filler and botox, you think their lips are going to explode! Go for the food you won't be disappointed  but this place is so entertaining, I'm sure the staff has great stories to tell!< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Truly a hidden gem. Located away from the main drag of Santa Barbara, Lucky's is beautifully situated and offers a phenomenal dining experience. I daresay the cuisine is very nearly second to none in the city. In addition, the waiting staff is very pleasant and accommodating. Lastly, the atmosphere is quite unlike any other. Very elegant; nothing too ostentatious, with just a tinge of that old Hollywood charm.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

A must visit when in the Santa Barbara area. The steakhouse felt like you were in the 70s at a classic restaurant. The steak had a nice char and was cooked to the correct temperature. The side dishes were good but on the large side so not everyone at the table needs one.< /text>

<text>I gave it a three star for the taste of the food and price. I thought the filet mignon was delicious! But I'd still prefer a Ruth's Chris filet over this one. The corn chowder was so delicious!! The jumbo shrimp was good, but very costly for only four. I didn't love the spinach, but the onion rings were great! They didn't have raspberry lemonade but they gave me a lemonade with raspberries in it which was very satisfying! It was a wonderful experience with great company and the staff was on top of it, but if you're going to spend money, Ruth's Chris still has them beat in my eyes.</text>< Response>

Wow. Amazing. Food is top notch and the food comes out quick. I sat at the bar waiting for my client to finish. I wish I could have had a drink, but I was driving that night.

I started with the warm goat cheese salad. Nice and tangy. Properly dressed.

I ordered the New York Pepper Steak with cognac. Holy cow..... Literally. That piece of meat must have come from and cow that formerly an angel. It melted in my mouth and the flavor was superb. Very peppery, which I love, and I also ordered a half order of the California golden beets. Yum!

I didn't order dessert because I had no room. I will be back.<//Text>

<review>Don't waste your time or your money, it's over priced low quality food masquerading as a high end steak house. Don't be fooled by the way it looks. These guys are trying to fool you into thinking it's an old school steakhouse, they have no idea how it's really done.

The front of house staff and wait staff are friendly and welcoming. That's as good as it gets, it's all down hill from there. The owners obviously have a captured market with the locals and the tourists. The same owners own Tre Lune an Italian restaurant down the street, my experience there was about the same as here.  Think of being in your local supermarket aisle looking at the cheapest cuts of meat that are on sale, you'd be better off buying that. They are offering  low quality steak at premium prices. I had the $65 Delmonico, the best they have on the menu, I've had a better steak at a local family resteraunt.  Do yourself a favor, go and eat at the San Ysidro Ranch, it's the most expensive hotel in town, the resteraunt, service and  ambience is first class, as is the food. Price wise it's cheaper to eat at the most expensive hotel in town than it is to get a sub par meal here at a higher price. Avoid this place.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Jackpot! Yes, everything is pricey, but the experience is so worth it!

We bicycled from uptown Santa Barbara, turning a night out into a mini-adventure. Next time I'll reserve a table in the bar, where I could keep an eye on the bikes. This first time we had a secluded table in the back with a view into the wine room – interesting.

They've got a big menu and even bigger wine list, so I asked for suggestions. It's a steak place, as you know, but I had steak last night, so it was Dover Sole, Meuniere for me. It was excellent. The service was great and so were the dark bread raisin rolls! Dessert? The Lucky Sunday, what else?!  Best night out in all of Santa Barbara? Might be...< /review>

Our steak was fine, but the other items leave room for improvement. Service and setting are great and don't need any change. I was once told by a restaurant owner that an Average review is the worst you can receive...and it hurts me to give this 3 Star review, but when you factor in the overall value I have no choice.</Text>< pics>

We absolutely love Lucky's!!  Although Santa Barbara is full of high quality restaurants, there are truly only a few World-Class level establishments, and Lucky's is one of them!

Dinner and their steak selection is always a five star affair, but I also recommend the Bar for a quick meal anytime, as well as the weekend Brunch menu - all are truly fantastic!  Bring your friends!  They will thank you!!!</review>

< Review>
We came from Colorado where there is no fresh seafood. They ran out of lobster. Here's the kicker, the group we were with made this reservation months,  many months in advance. This is a big time FAIL for the management and owners of this restaurant. They completely dropped the ball and you should be fired.  Learn how to prepare!!!!! This was extremely disappointing.
I ended up ordering the abalone and fillet mignon. Both were  mediocre at best. Of course it's not fair to compare colorado local beef to the masses where they don't care how the beef are raised and processed. Running out of  lobster is unforgivable. Now I know what John Candy felt like in the "Summer Rental".
The servers were fantastic. The 1 star rating is a reflection on the management only.<//Review>

<review>This is a classic old school steak house. The food is exceptional and the place is run by pros. Did I mention the food is exceptional?  It's is. Try the abalone. The steaks are to die for. The wine choices boggle the mind. The staff is the best, they treat you as if you are a regular, and seem to know exactly the right time to ask how they might help, without getting in the way. Perfect place for a date, a nice family dinner, or a fun night with friends.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

DO NOT GO HERE EXPECTING A GREAT MEAL!  For a high end steak house, with high end prices, the food is poorly prepared.

Everything is  A-La-Cart. The side dishes are right out of a can. The steaks are nothing special and certainly not worth the price charged.

Do yourself a favor ... don't spend you $500 here. You can get the same dinning experience anywhere on State Street.<//Review>

<Text>Upscale, well serviced, very nice atmosphere restaurant. We loved the escargot [impeccable], ratatouille & warm spinach salad. To be honest, we've had better filet mignon [it was a bit tough] & seared rare tuna [not the best quality, i make my own poke so i know good tuna]... hence the 4 star.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>It all started when we asked to change a table. The front desk told us we would be able to change in 60 minutes. 15 minutes into the wait or waiter doesn't ask us if we are alright or anything (probably because we decided we wouldn't order until we changed spots to make it easier for the waiting staff). It's as if we don't exists in the restaurant. 45 mins later (and yes. After the 30.) The hostess says that it will be another hour until we move. It's clearly just become a game for them and they are gossiping around the corner as we simply sit. Finally we give up and leave and guess what, there's four free tables around the corner.

Horrific waiting staff. I ordered a pale ale got an IPA and they tried to argue that it was a pale ale as well.

Well never going back.

Looked good. Just don't change your table.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The creme de la creme. You won't find better food or service anywhere guaranteed. The price matches the quality and truly is worth every penny. The general manager made espevially sure our night was truly magical.<//Review>

Very pricy steak house, but it's in Montecito! Kirk Douglas frequented the place, as do other neighborhood locals. The staff is very attentive, and the food is excellent. Even the meat loaf sells out fast :-D so get there early!</Text>

We called 8 days in advance and they told us we could only be seated at the “courtyard”. The courtyard felt more like a graveyard, for the same expensive prices. Add to that a ran down kitchen, and this is a bad deal, just fuzz.</Review>

The steakhouse of Montecito. Delicious food at a fairly lofty price. Full bar and wine cellar. Really spectacular food, if you're willing to pay for it.<//Review>

The glitziest steakhouse in town. Great cuts of meat, great salads and a great time eating in one of the nicest restaurants in town.</Review>

This very upscale steak house in Monticeto boasts excellent service, an outstanding wine menu, and great drinks and atmosphere. Be prepared to part with the cash in your wallet though. This place is pricey. If I have one criticism of Lucky’s for dinner, it would be that their steaks are priced above their quality. They lack that buttery umami that an equivalent restaurant in Aspen or Las Vegas might deliver, but they are still excellent.</text>

< Review>
They ruined our special event evening by making my wife violently ill by ignoring the food allergy that she informed them about when ordering.  My wife got to spend half the meal throwing up in the bathroom but they were kind enough to comp her the soup that made her violently ill, the steak she couldn't eat because she was ill, the drink she couldn't drink because she was ill. They certainly are not a classy place. The food is highly overrated. You can do better.< /Review>

Went there tonight...
Waited 15 minutes for wine, received the wrong bottle waited another 15 minutes (a total of 30 from seating)... No bread, no water no wine. we walked out
Much better service somewhere else
Valet was great, too bad Lucky's isn't...< /Review>

<Review>Owner and staff very nice. She did not do my pedi or mani but the 2 employees who did Diane and Tina? did a great job. The mani and pedi costed $63.00. I tipped both employees 1 2 dollars and 1 3 dollars. I think tip is included in service. I will return for another mani and pedi. Maybe they will have a weekly special in the future or senior day for folks 60 and over. Staff did a great job. I normally travel to Oakland but I will call this shop home. All the employees were doing outstanding worked. I was impressed. Not cheap.. I didn't pay this much at Wal mart they had combinations or specials. I like this shop much better...< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809009568af48389:0xe09f490bbfba1dd7</GmapID></record>

<time>1559101919729</time><text>not satisfied with my nails. first red flag was that the lady didn’t push down my cuticles and then the other red flag was that she used actual scissors instead of an actual nail clipper. She also made me bleed. I asked for marble but i don’t know what she did because what i got is not marble. at all. it was just all bad. she also didn’t put top coat on my right hand but put it on my left hand. so unprofessional and a mess</text>< Rating>

Next day nail broke and glue came off another three days later. Over priced and not done right. $40 for full what a joke and she had nerve to charge me $30 for fill. Gel also done at that no other special things done.<//review>

They were so friendly and able to make my nails look beautiful at affordable price. The shop itself was spotless with welcoming atmosphere.</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Will never come here again. I got my nails done here 3 times. First time, my nails turned out nice. The 2nd time, my GEL polish was discolorong and peeling off. The 3rd time was the last time EVER. The lady doing my nails was bleeding while doing my nails and some of the blood from her finger kept getting on my fingers. I told her she’s bleeding and she ignored me and continued on my nails. I kept telling her and she got mad because I kept telling her she’s bleeding and it’s getting on my hands. I got up to wash my hands and ask if someone else can do my nails, the owner went to the back and was hiding. So gross. (I have pictures of nails discoloration and peeling off as proof).</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

She fixed the womans mistake and ever since then Jean has been my girl! She trys to make conversation and makes you feel comfortable. Never an awkward silnce with her.

I got in my car thinking my nails were dry and they smeared. I came back in and told them and they still acted clueless about what Gel polish was and how soon it was supposed to dry until I got a lil upset then they said ok ok we get it for you, and then did. Today I decided to come back just for a simple pedicure since it's near my home. I asked if she could make my lukewarm water a little hotter. She acted like she did and I just took my feet out of the water and sat them on top because it was that uncomfortable. When she seen my feet on the top she made it hotter and said ok it's hot now. Why is it that hard to get good service. Plus insulting me asking me why do I look different this time. Um I obviously don't have on makeup. I'm not coming back again.< /Text><GmapID>0x809009568af48389:0xe09f490bbfba1dd7<//GmapID></record>

They will up charge after they do your service. So what they say is your price won't be the same. Rip offs<//text>

I finally cut my cable and am very pleased I did it. I was an Xfinity customer for 10 years, which was so much more expensive for less service. My neighbor kept recommending Starry. It was so easy to make the switch and Starry deserves all the credit. Victor Tam was my Starry Installation Technician. He was professional, courteous, fast, as well as, ready to answer my questions. It took less than an hour. Victor was great. I am a happy customer.</Text>

about 6 months in... best residential internet I've ever had. no question.  there's not even a close second. I can honestly say with 240/320mbps  speeds at a locked rate of $50 month, die-hard starry customer for life.

UPDATE: My brain has melted from the 5G waves. I love it< /text>

<Review>My experience with Starry has been right on target. So far so good and I hope it will only get better. The $50 flat rate is the best thing ever. Why more people aren't signing up for this service is beyond me. I'm so happy that my building decided to go the Starry way. Thanks Starry for allowing me to cut my cable.</Review>< Date>

<rating>4</rating><text>Overall, the service is very good and affordable.
The reason it's only 4 stars is because it can be highly unreliable during rain and high winds.
I've had to contact support 5 times during the 2 and a half months I've had this service. Their customer support is VERY GOOD. They are quick and responsive. However, I would rather not have to message them every other week to get my internet to work.

Still, it's WAY better than AT&T, but they need to do something to improve their reliability because it's starting to get annoying.
I like that there is no cap on data usage and there doesn't seem to be any noticeable throttling like other main ISPs do.</text>< Pics>

Starry is awesome! $50 a month with no hidden fees. Everything is included to get you connected on the day of install. Speeds average 200M up and down. The app is user friendly and very easy to use. They also accept Apple Pay which is a +!
If it’s available in your area, make the switch!< /Text>

I LOVE Starry.  Not only did they liberate my home from the bad service of Spectrum, the location of their router turned out to be more convenient, their app is easy to use, and the one time I had a question about the service they immediately got back to me.  The only thing you will regret with Starry is not switching to them earlier.</Text>

I don't write reviews. But I adore starry, I tell all my friends if it is available to get it. I have only had an outage once and they took care of it quickly. I love that I can control my internet from an app. Also because I was the first to sign up in my building I got a hand delivered gift basket. So now I have some solid starry socks and sunglasses and I love them. Thanks starry!!!</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Starry is great!!! They are super responsive and proactive. The was one time where I was notified via the handy starry app that there was a potential outage in my building. The internet didn’t go out, but I really appreciate they gave me the heads up so I could save what I was doing and plan to move locations to finish work. Love the look of the router and that I can control everything from my phone. AND the speeds they offer at only $50 a month can’t be beat. I’m moving in a couple weeks and devastated I can’t use starry at my new building. Hoping they expand soon! 🤞🏻<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I want to thank Field Service Technicians Wayne T. and Marc K for installing internet and phone service in my home. After spending around $1500 on the best "tech guys in SF", who couldn't fix our problems or return our phone calls, The Sonic techs had everything working before they left! Thank you very much!< /Text>

I'm so glad Starry became an option in my building. So much faster than Spectrum, cheaper, and they're not constantly haranguing me to upgrade to cable or other services the way other providers do. As of now I don't think I'll ever go to another internet provider.< /review>

I really enjoy Starry internet service. You absolutely cannot beat the price! If we ever have issues with our internet going out, I usually receive an email letting me know they are working to fix the problem before I can even call it in. Very quick. There are a couple "Dead zones" in the apartment but they are very tiny areas. Like I said, cannot beat the price/value!<//Review>

I have had every major provider for my wifi and Starry is superior to them in every single way. The people who work there are kind, responsive, and professional. The wifi is fast, and reliable. The app is great and makes everything so simple like getting help, restarting my station, changing the settings of my station, or making payments. Another bonus point for esthetics! The Starry station looks really nice and sleek. I am so grateful I was able to switch to Starry in my building!< /text>

<Review>Starry Internet is the best service I have had in the 25 years I have been using the internet. The service is fast and a very great price for the excellent service you get while on the internet and the great customer service support staff that is very helpful and knowledgeable about just about anything you might have a problem or questions about. IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS LOOKING FOR NEW OR A CHANCE OF INTERNET SERVICE, STARRY IS THE ONE YOU NEED. (SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?) PICK UP YOUR PHONE AND CALL THEM. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPONTED. I GUARANTEE YOU!!! Rick a very happy and satisfied customer...😄👍<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b997fd7f0f95:0xc1e6271af1836f77</Gmap_id><username>R MAC1</username><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>103198770941161545822</user_id><rating>5</rating>< Time>

I love, love, love this service! When they became available in my building I immediately signed up to get away from Spectrum. $50/month forever? With more then twice the speed I was getting? YES PLEASE.

I set up my installation day, and they came right on time. The only reason the installation lasted so long is because my previous provider made a mess of all the old wires.

What I love most about this service is the touch pad router they give you. Super modern, slick, and cute. You can do everything from that thing which makes is extremely convenient. I like convenience.

I would recommend them to everyone.< /text>

Starry is fast enough for streaming, works great with gaming and any other everyday tasks. I've played Overwatch and League, ran PS4 downloads, and used Nintendo Switch online play with no issues. It also works smoothly with my iPad and phone when I want to save on data costs. Definitely recommend Starry to anyone looking for a good deal on an internet plan!< /Text>< pics>

I had att before this was paying $55-60 for 24mb and I needed a landline so there were other costs involved. With start it's $50 all the way for 200 and often 300mb. That's nuts!!!
I recommend you to get it if they have it in your building.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I'm a video content professional working from home, so having dependable & fast internet is essential and the backbone of my livelihood.

As soon as I found out about Starry, did some research and saw that their customer service was absolutely second to none and their pricing was unbeatable.

Decided to sign-up that same day. Service tech was very nice and respectful, had me up and running in less than an hour.

Their router is super space-age, and you can request to have a customer service technician call you right on the vibrant & colorful touch screen.

Starry is the Internet Service Provider we need in our lives. Highly recommend.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Starry is one of the best value for speed ISP in Los Angeles. Customer service is top notch: quick, direct, and efficient. Download and Upload speeds are consistently over 200 Mbps each. The only thing I would wish they improved on is their router which is a bit faulty at times. I would highly recommend Starry if it’s an option in your area.<//text>

<review>Excellent experience so far! I was able to set up an installation within 24 hours and during the weekend, something other internet providers were not able to provide. The technician was friendly, on time, and walked me through any questions I had. Best of all, the customer service has been incredible. Anytime I had a question or needed to troubleshoot something, I have been able to talk to a representative within 2 minutes of calling. Overall, I appreciate the excellent customer service and hassle free set up. Great job Starry!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Be aware of possible damages to your property caused by Starry. A few Starry technicians installed the internet in our apartment building and they damaged my car while working in the garage.

Unfortunately they didn’t ask the leasing office to move my car; nobody was aware of this situation. They drilled holes in the concrete ceiling, pulled cables and worked with equipment around/above my car. Rocks and drills fell all over my car and it was a mess as my car was completely covered by debris. In addition, they didn’t clean up after themselves…

A Starry technician told me somebody would call me the next day to resolve the issue but nobody called at all! I’ve made several attempts over the past few weeks to obtain their liability insurance information, however they did not provide it. No attempts on their side. They kept saying somebody would contact me.

As their field office failed to comply with the state law, I contacted their headquarters in Boston. A customer representative assured me that a manager would call me immediately to resolve this issue. So far no phone calls. I found this as an unfair practice.

Do I really want to subscribe to their internet services, have them come over to my apartment and maybe cause more damages? I’ll probably cancel an upcoming appointment with them and not use their internet services.

This is a nightmare and disappointment. It’s time consuming as I will probably have to file a lawsuit. One star rating for being ignored by Starry after the company damaged my car and didn't fix it. Shame on you, Starry!<//text>

Fast speed, free trial period, efficient installation, and reasonable monthly rate. Can't ask for better internet service. I had been waiting for a long time for a better internet service provider to come around to our building after Spectrum hiked their price. So glad that Starry arrived and made a difference.< /Review>

<Review>I was apprehensive, but the people at Starry are all amazing - what a refreshing change !  The service has been very reliable and there has never been a time when it was offline. It is a lot faster than the Spectrum service I had. Spectrum speed was 115 Mbps Download and 12 Mbps Upload. Starry is about 360 Mbps Download and 400 Mbps upload. Yes !</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Starry is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stuffy internet service world.
I'm loving the service, the price is right & the company has been very hands on in their approach. In the past I have felt trapped in bundle deals with no other choice but to pay for services I didn't need at a premium price. I'm happy a new vibrant company is taking over the market!!!<//text>

Quick and easy setup, comes with an app where you can message a support member and they responded within minutes. The app also lets you see what devices are connected. Flat rate with no hidden fees and quick/reliable internet! A great alternative to bigger companies; they didn't try to nickel and dime me into buying a more expensive package that I didn't need.</text>

Simply the best. for $50 a month you get internet speeds upwards of 80Mbps!. Whats more is their customer service and service plans. No awkward promotions, no clueless contractors but just a smooth completely online customer support system. This truly is internet for the 21st century. Thank you Starry.</review>

I am so impressed with the service and price of this new (to Los Angeles) internet service provider. Everyone I have dealt with is extremely courteous and friendly and everything has worked exactly as promised. Since I have only been a customer for approximately two months (with absolutely NO problems, I might add), I will be updating this in the future; but I must say that if you are tired of the high prices and nonsense of "bundling" to get a decent price on your internet service I would highly recommend that you check out Starry.< /review>

<review>It’s the best internet service so far and I’ve  tried them all. Not only they let you try it out for a month free and if you don’t like it you can cancel anytime so you got nothing to lose...

I look forward to only paying $50 a month. I guess the last straw with spectrum was when I over paid my bill by five dollars and they made up a charge called other rather than putting it towards my next month. I’m sure I’ll save a few thousand trees because I won’t get all of this junk mail that tends to not know what services I already have as well as The fact that my bill is due on the 17th if that really not until the 26th but I just received a phone call just now reminding me I’m sure I’ll get 5000 more times before the end of the week</text>

I originally had a service with Spectrum from $45 @ 100mps. At first, I thought this was an excellent deal, until I found out that this price was for a 12 month period only. After finding out that the price of my internet would increase, I became very interested in Starry's internet service. They offer a 200mps @$50/month. Since I live really close to the antenna, which is how the connection occurs, I get anywhere from 250-350mps. At this insane speed and only for $50, why would I ever go back to spectrum? If your location is eligible for this internet service provider, please do change. You wont regret their customer service, tech support, and awesome incentives.</review>

I agree with last review 100%!  Practically seems like they don’t want your business. Second time here and not going back. Also bought a glass straw from them, knew it was a cheap one but that’s all they had, and it clogged after a few draws and couldn’t clear it.</Text>

<Review>Edit: the name on my ID and Credit Card did match. The owner is just trying to save face after the terrible service I experienced, everything I commented still applies.

I was about to purchase an item of sub-par quality because I was in a pinch and the manager looked at my ID and Credit Card and said that it wasn't me, even though it was my picture and the name matched. Will never come back, will tell others to never shop there due to very rude management and unprofessional conduct.

All of these other commentors are just family or friends of the owner to boost their rating. Beware shopping here, go anywhere else if you can.< /Review>< Pictures>

Fernando was great, super friendly and a great conversation.
Also by far the cheapest I've found after the April tax hike, will definitely be using this as my go to little shop.
Has a huge variety too with everything I was looking for.< /review>

Marc or Mark the person who assisted me made sure I walked out not only with the right product but also made sure it was a proper match. Hands down this store has the best customer service experience and I didn't feel at all like a stranger, was greeted at the door and even had a conversation about how my day was going. Such a great experience!!</Text>

<Date>1480815804814</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I went in to purchase some Kratom. I expected it to be more pricey due to it being capsuled. I didn't check it until I was ready to take it at the beach and noticed there were only THREE capsules and so I thought, "That's odd, they must be very potent then, especially since I paid nearly 20 dollars for it." However, I have never been so underwhelmed by the fact it didn't help my pain (I did get the strain that normally helps my back pain), or even give me regular smoke shop Kratom effects. I understand that smokeshops will give you less than an actual merchant. I was on vacation and didn't have access to a merchant and was needing some. If you want kratom from this smokeshop, SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<username>Eddie<//username><Text>Great shop with great hours. Even open a little later on weekends.
Sure do love this place and its prices. Great staff as well.

I docked 2 stars because this place is where i go for all my Hookah tobacco needs and its not what it used to be in that section.

They used to have a different setup where you would be able to pull shisha from the shelves and smell them to see which one you like as well as pick up any accessories like bowl gromets or hoses as well as charcoal.

The set up now is behind a long glass display and everytime you want to smell a can of shisha you have to ask them to get it for you. Its kind of annoying having to ask them to take down a can and having to point at it over and over until they are pointing at the same one youre looking at. I dont go there for shisha anymore. Kind of a bummer actually because i did enjoy the freedom that place gave you.

Think of it this way.
Going into a room full of candy but its all behind a bar and you have to point at each and every single candy you want to try. Kind of annoying when you have little time and there is customers behind you

EDIT: I returned to this shop as usual and I still enjoy it. I wasn't aware that the law required keeping all products behind a counter. I didn't know this because like i said I usually just go for the hookah stuff. Anyways, staff is awesome and this place is 5*.<//Text><userid>118060843602806312576< /userid><Gmap_id>0x80dcf1ef25d6b751:0x35c263e5411eeba6</Gmap_id>< Time>

Had a delicious brunch with the family here today. This was our first time at this location. We had the meatball hash, but substituted the meatball for short rib and it was exquisite. Also shared, brioche French toast while the kids had pancakes and french toast. A great time was had by all, it was the first time we'd eaten inside a restaurant for over a year. Felt safe here as all the tables were spread far apart and most of the restaurant is open the outside air. A gentle breeze blew throughout and brought fresh air to our noses.< /text>

<response>None</response><Review>I miss  and love this place so much. These were taken back in July, we haven't gone back since. Not because of the place but Covid has made it hard to live normal lives. Felt a bit selfish going out during these times. Last time we were here we left the fattest tip for such an amazing experience. I forget who our waiter was but he was so kind. But you know what, this place never disappoints. My boyfriend I loved going here. We reminisce about our brunches and dinners here occasionally.</Review></record>

They also serve one in a pitcher with an entire Rotisserie chicken! 😳 This was the veggie version. The breakfast was delicious also vegetarian/vegan friendly. Their Açaí bowl looked amazing! Next time! Very well set up for those worried about social distancing. Good ambiance and plenty of outdoor seating options.

When we arrived our wait time was an hour which is what I expected. To my surprise, we were called 10 minutes later. 🤩.  We were pretty excited. It took our server about 30 minutes just to take our order. We had 4 kids (2, 3, 4 & 11). The kids were fine so the wait wasn’t pressing. Kids ordered yogurt and fruit which was perfect because it would come out reasonably fast. We wait and wait.  I had to flag down a random person to get water. When the food finally came out, about 90 minutes after we were seated, eggs were made wrong, sausage was cold and the jambalaya was also cold. Kids food never came out. The server comes back to bring the missing protein from the egg breakfast.  She then returned with the fixed eggs. Still no food for the kids. I flagged down the next person I saw to ask where the kids was and the kids were finally granted their food to eat 🤦🏽‍♀️. The jambalaya came with cold shrimp and cold sausage and again the eggs were made wrong. Upon speaking to the manager, she defended the kitchen saying they are really slammed. Perhaps a simple “I’m so sorry” “ what can we do to fix this?” Would have been appropriate. My son ended up eating mc Donald’s because we weren’t going to wait another hour to get hot food. The manager didn’t even discount the bill. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Will never go back there again< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I am going to go ahead and vent out a bit here (sorry). My family and I were there yesterday 3/30/21 and were seated outside. After we got seated we got the (tab) water in a bottle and then that's it! no one came to take our order for like 20 minutes or least to tell us that they were busy that perhaps they would be right back.. nothing! I really wanted to try their food and my kids were actually behaving well.. patiently waiting. We ended up leaving and after my wife mentioned to the hostess that were waiting but now leaving her "Sorry" was pretty dry and unemotional like she really didn't care or at least that how my wife felt. My wife had been here before and really like it but now it seems but we wont be back anytime soon to give it another try. We would have totally understood if they had apologized for the wait since Covid restrictions have been lifted and perhaps restaurants need to adjust their staffing a bit but NO effort was made to get us back to the table AT ALL. The food can be great but if they overlooked their customers service it will come back to bite them.

PS. the glasses that they brought for the water smelled like fish! (one of my kids said). 3 out of 4 glasses smelled like they had not been washed properly.</Text>< user_id>

Here for their San Diego Restaurant Week dinner (3 courses for $40). The food was great as a special for Restaurant Week. Would I pay the regular price for this dinner, probably not.

Tables are spread out and they have plexi glass dividers between some of the tables. They also have outdoor seating with heaters. One thing that did bother me was that the manager wasn't wearing his mask properly (not covering his nose).< /text>

Went here Tuesday afternoon for brunch and was seated inside. We were able to see the kitchen staff through a big glass divider. Only one chef was wearing a mask properly, the dishwasher and the food runner. Our server was excellent. The other food preparers had chin guards and were passing around a cell phone and definitely not washing their hands in between. I would not have thought that was sanitary pre-pandemic, much less now. I wouldn’t recommend eating here, just for lack of sanitation standards by those preparing food.<//Text>

I have been here multiple times before and always enjoyed the food and service. Brunch yesterday was unfortunately a whole different story. My table of 4 waited for an hour and a half for our food! Our waitress re-took our order at one point just to “double check” she had the right order but did not tell us that there had been a mix up in the kitchen. She then repeatedly told us our food would be out in a couple of minutes which it never was. I understand that mistakes are made and it was a busy morning, but I would have appreciated her just being honest with what happened vs. telling us things that were not true. She did give us a dessert and a small discount, but at that time I was already over it. To finish it off, there was an extremely rude employee who when I asked for a box, he did not respond, and instead did a shooing gesture with his hand and walked away. Not a positive experience at all!<//Review>

Awful awful awful. I was so excited to come here with some friends and we were treated terribly. The waiter from the beginning was rude and he got our drink order wrong. Once we got our drinks the same drink type was made differently for two people . One was strong and the other was normal. Once the food got there it looked amazing but it had little taste per my groups feedback. I would describe my experience with the food but I never got to eat my filet mignon since they cooked it rare and I asked medium well. I requested for them to cook it a little more. From here on our server kept avoiding us and another server had to stop him and tell him to come take care of our table and gave him my food to come bring it. It took them about 30 minutes to give me my food but by this time everyone was done eating and we left.</Text>

We had crab cake + beef tartare for appetizers, NY steak + artichoke ravioli for entrees, and limoncello for dessert. All were packed with flavor with a great flavor balance and taste, but the steak didn't pack as hard of a punch as the other dishes. Overall a solid place to visit.</Text>< Pictures>

Happy hour menu was still advertised on their website so my friends and I were excited to
Check this out for happy hr on Friday. We were so disappointed to find out when we got seated that they no longer have happy hr as it was advertised on their website Monday - Friday. The manager came over and talked to us and still reiterated the same thing and happy hr would not be able to be honored. We are still disappointed at the approach and just decided to leave altogether. Hoping I get to give this place another chance but not any time soon...< /text>

Worst service ever, the servers were rude and took so long to just bring out the menu. To top it all off the waiter was drinking wine with the table next to us instead of taking our order. Food was good but I will never eat there again.</Review>

I give them credit because some of the cooks are still learning how to make gluten free food correctly. The BACON here is the best in the west. I also love how big the pancakes are. All in all this is a great place to go to when you fresh drive into the area. The staff are wondering and be on point. Excellent customer service skills. This will be my little spot when I drive from phoenix working. 👍🏾<//Text>

<Review>This is now my new favorite restaurant in San Diego! Tasty delicious local food, superb service, fabulous decor. My friend and I went here for our birthdays and the server who I wish I remembered  his name, 000104 (no name on the receipt) was extremely attentive, patient with our questions, and personable. He made our dinner extra special! Can’t wait to go again soon!<//Review>< Pictures>

First time here, and was not disappointed! COVID precautions make it comfortable to eat and relax. We ate from the brunch menu, and the food is amazing. Tried the Cali Omelette and the Chilaquiles both were so delicious! Large portions of food make the price worth it. Their mimosas are made with fresh juice, and so good. Service is great here too.< /review>

<rate>4</rate><Text>So I saw this ad for this place and the admin IG featured this massive bloody Mary. I pulled up place in various platforms and the review pattern is almost identical. You either love the place or you hate it, very little middle ground. A lot of the reviewers said their food was bland and lacked flavor. Some people even suggested to bring your own salt and pepper. Other people said the service was less than desirable and wait times were excessive. So after going through several pages of reviews, I was on the fence.

We agreed to meet a friend there Saturday for brunch and here is my take. I can't vouch for who was manning the kitchen the days these individuals visited the place. We ordered an omelette, chilaquiles and the American breakfast. Food was delicious. The chilaquiles were really good. The chips still had a crunch to them and the salsa they lathered the chips in wasn't mild but it wasn't hot. Great balance and they used queso fresco, which just added to the experience. My Chile relleno omelette was delicious BUT if there was one thing I'd complain about was the fact that they served me the ends of the bread, both sides.

Two other items that I would agree on with previous reviewers. While we were seated almost immediately, server came as we were sitting and we requested coffee and water and a few more minutes to look at menu before ordering. She didn't come back for about 15 minutes and then also forgot my coffee. I'd easily give this place the full 5 stars but the bread ends and the long wait and forgotten coffee just brings their score down. I'd gone lower but the food was great and that's the experience we all want right? Great food even if the other areas aren't up to par.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

LOVE LOVE LOVE the What in Blue Blazes drink!
I really love this place but gave 4 stars just cuz I wish they had less breakfast/ brunch food all day and had more of their dinner menu items included on the lunch menu. But all the food is delicious! I'm just not a huge breakfast foods person so I have a hard time finding something to eat off the menu unless it's dinner. Definitely give this place a try. And have a yummy drink while you're there!</review>

My wife and I went here for Valentine's Day. The food was delicious and the restaurant adhered to local COVID-19 protocols. Our only issue was with our waitress not being as attentive. Granted, I understand it was later in the evening and she was probably burned out from a busy day, but it would have been nice to be checked on more frequently.< /review>

Food was good when they finally got it right frist the add no sauce to it then there was no veggies in it then we asked for that and some how they removed the sauce but added veggies then gave us the sauce on the side after we asked. Crabe cakes were not the best the vons ones are better but there food was still good other than that.</Review>

<Text>Easter dinner was lacking. From the slow service to overcooked entrees all around, two overcooked steaks, overcooked swordfish and a overcooked leg of lamb. Best thing was the limoncello cake and the cocktails. For the price we paid for four meals, I would have expected a top noch meal.</Text>< pictures>

<review>I didn't have a good impression when I tried to get in....I couldn't find the right entrance!  Hint:  To avoid my dork moment, enter through the bar.  When I arrived for lunch, it was loud and crowded.  Reservations were not available on Open Table, but a phone call to the restaurant  worked.   Food is amazingly good.  Wait staff was very attentive, friendly, professional and checked in often.  We were not rushed through our meal.  Patio seating was very comfortable thanks to roll down shades and ceiling fans even though it was sunny and blazing hot outside.  Nice rural decor and theme.  Food was at the right temperature and the flavors let you know this wasn't reheated industrial chow jazzed up with sauce and garnish;  this was real eats made fresh on the premises.  Save room for dessert.  I'm definitely coming back.<//review><userid>108543670078346302783< /userid>< Pics>

It's a trendy type place. I didn't have any Italian (lunch or dinner). They have their style of American breakfast and some "unique" items. A fried chicken Bloody Mary. Looked interesting. The lady who ordered it said it was good. (I couldn't tell if she was trying to recover from a hangover.) I'd bet their Italian dinners are good.<//text>

Overall experience... Good..

Ordered the breakfast burrito (big enough to feed 2 people or one really hungry person); comes with bacon, egg, avocado, onions, and cheese (in it). Potatoes in the side. The potatoes were well cooked, tender and hot; a little plain in flavor (no seasoning, salt). The coffee is strong but not bitter.

The service was mixed. For a busy Sunday morning crowd, I do expect some wait while the staff is servicing others, but only served coffee when I sat down; had to ask for it at the end of my meal from someone passing by. Only saw our waitress 3 times, seating, about 5 minutes later to take order and once food arrived.

Food was good enough to make me want to come back and try other things. Hopefully service picks up.</review>

Food is good, try to order something different each time. The green ground beef with spinach and pesto to me is not a good combination... looks like it should only be served on saint Patrick's day and too oily.
The soy chorizo is good with a slight of spiciness. The grilled Turkey and mozzarella sandwich is very good.
Coffee is different each time... sometimes very strong and sometimes medium strong.
Only been to this restaurant for breakfast.
Bring a sweater or jacket... on cold mornings they have all the sliding doors open although they have heaters it could get chilly especially for some people.< /Text>

Great mimosas, can't say anything about my food. My food was incorrect, I let the food runner know. They kept arguing about the plate correctness, and I just asked them to take the plate and to please leave I didn't want to argue. They told me I was rude and needed to learn to talk to people. I asked for the manager. I explained what occurred and was told she was protecting her people and that runner would not come near the table anymore, even though they came with the manager to listen to our conversation. I explained that I agree she shouldn't come around anymore, but what was she protecting? I was treated poorly. Manager said, you made them cry. I asked if it was possible they were crying because they exhibited talking back behavior to a customer? I was told my food would be boxed and I should go. I declined to eat at that point and asked for my beverage bill and was told to leave. I understand things are rough, but being rude to customers asking for their food to be corrected is probably not the way to go.</text>

I recently had lunch at Farmer’s Table La Mesa with an old friend. It was a pleasant experience. Overall the food was good, and the service was commendable. I really enjoyed the openness of the restaurant as well—the ceilings are very high and most of the restaurant is open-walled, creating a carefree atmosphere and allowing nice breezes to roll through.

The food itself was all right. Their current limited menu offers a variety of salads, sandwiches, flatbreads, and a few other items. We ordered the Greek quinoa salad, the roasted chicken flatbread, and the turkey sandwich. The salad was great. The flatbread pretty good, though it could’ve been cooked longer as the crust was still floppy. The sandwich was kind of ‘meh’—it was overly cheesy, the roasted peppers were soggy, and the asparagus made for difficult chewing.

Despite this, I think the restaurant is good, and worth a visit. I’d say to definitely try and avoid the turkey sandwich though! It seems they have extensive coffee and alcohol bars as well, which would be definitely worth checking out if that’s your thing.< /Text>

Lively atmosphere with charming farm decor. Great menu with unique menu selections. The meatball hash from the breakfast menu was very delicious. The food is presented very nicely, you almost don't want to eat it, it's so pretty. The Bloody Mary's were good and potent. One was enough and well worth the price.< /Review>

This is my last straw attempting to order delivery from  Farmer’s table in La Mesa. They have cancelled orders in past but not like this...(this is the ONLY place that cancelled orders on me after confirmation and prep) this time this place prepped it for 40 minutes then cancelled. This is like a slap in face to a customer. Makes me feel they don’t appreciate my customer service. If I could go get it myself I would, but I have been sick forced to isolate, so cannot even go to a grocery store. I wasn’t able to celebrate holidays or see any family for months, so one thing I have to look forward to is some good food, which is luxury when you can’t go get it yourself. So for a restaurant to keep cancelling on you and now after all this time is so rude! I’m not sure if anyone had same experience through delivery service with them, but personally will never order from them again.< /Text>

Nice place to eat and good service. Had the fettuccine with chicken. Noodles were buttery but would have preferred the white sauce instead. Chicken was a little dry and little to no flavor. My first time eating there. Would go back to try a different plate.< /Text>

<review>If you drink alcoholic beverages for lunch, I guess this place is for you. I had a Pecan Salad.  It was at best a 2 star $3 salad for around $18. My friend had a Pecan something sandwich. He said it was very dry.
The salads at the Lunch Box down the street beat the hell outta the salad I had here.
I'll never go back.<//review><response>None<//response></record>

Ambience was cool very nice bar tender food was very disappointing truffle fries had too much arugula no other flavor or texture certainly not truffle also had the shrimp flatbread had to send back to cut into slices we could pull apart but even after that the thing was just poorly executed just mozzerella and shrimp soggy gross.< /text>

Arrived at 9:30 am September 13th, was not seated until 10:00am where they immediately took our order, but then we waited for an hour until 11:10 to get our food. The hour wait is what killed it for me. Our order was not excessive or anything special. No one asked if we wanted drinks. They were honestly just too busy to be able to treat us nicely. So if you come, come when it’s not busy!!< /text>

Yes, indoor dining is available as well as outdoor.

First time there. Nice atmosphere, good menu (both food and drink), tasty and good sized portions. Food took a little long but worth the wait. Order an appetizer or a couple rounds while you wait!< /Review>

<review>This is one of the few times that I have to do a one-star review. How do I explain this place? If a friend ask me about it I would say it was 4/5 food serve by 3/5 staff, and 1/5 clientele. It's a magical place inhabited by mustachioed and bearded men who aren't cheating on their girlfriends but are using their shampoos without them knowing for their beard. It's the kind of trying the place you would expect to be lit by tungsten lighting an Indie lyrics.

This is the kind of bar that you're not allowed to have fun in because having fun is too cool and we're not here to have fun. I'll explain my one out of five stars. kitchen staff taking a dump is one thing, but if you know there is a line... at least fake the fact you washed your hands. 2, staff going out of their way for tips treating people better the. You in your group except you, the poorly dressed person. Only to completely change their attitude the moment they see you're paying the entire bill.

Basically disappointing. This is an example of a flash in the pan trendy restaurant that is faking it until they make it.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmQMvQ619N65G3f_gFjeTcoiBoEQcUwXidk1zL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<text>11/26 - I called at 9 am to place my take-home turkey dinner (to soc dist). I was told to call back at/after 3 pm. Called and was told it would take 20-30 minutes for food to be ready. Got there at 3:15. At 4:30 I had to ask how much longer. By then there were about a dozen parties waiting to get their take-homes. At around 5 pm the brought out our food and the order was wrong. So the took us in (we all were waiting outside) to go over the order. The guy helping us eventually brought out the missed items and told us we could keep the un-ordered items. Left just before 6 pm.</text><UserId.>104212882599640994773< /UserId.><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2</Gmap_id>< Rating>

Quite a pricey place, but the waitress was nice and the food was really good. A nice once a month splurge. Loved the game of the day idea. Try the excellent bison, and pasta dishes.</text>

We asked for water with our food order and kept a drink menu to order drinks with our meal. The water never came and we had to ask another server for water halfway through our meals. She did manage to come back eventually to drop our check off, but never revisited our table between sitting down and cashing out.</Review>< Pictures>

This place has great food, great service for the price that you pay. The pizzas were perfectly baked in a brick oven which made them taste and smell better. The kids had pancakes and they were the best pancakes with homemade whipped cream. We love eating there and go there with the family at least twice a month.< /review>

Wonderful food and drinks in a great area of town! The decor is top notch throughout the restaurant and even in the restrooms! Definitely coming back to try some of the other pizza and drinks. The Bloodly Mary here have an interesting spin in them. The staff is wonderful and very kind.

Update: one month later. Still one of the best restaurants in this area of town. The homemade whip cream is the best on there pancakes!<//Text>

First off the food is VERY good but the overall experience detracted from the overall experience so I cannot give it more stars.  We made a reservation that took 30 minutes beyond our reservation time...I get it's a holiday weekend but it took over a hour to get our food once the order was placed....I think the kitchen may have been totally disorganized. Our poor waiter was profusely apologetic but I honestly didn't expect my total experience would take 2.5 hours. I have been to the downtown location....I think it's worth the drive to go down there instead of this location!<//Review>

This place is great! The food is really good and the establishment is clean. The staff is friendly! They get all the food from the local farm and restaurants. If you stop by La Mesa check out this restaurant!! Awesomeness!!< /text>

This is a wonderful place for brunch. They have fabulous Bloody Mary selection. I had a spicy version with shrimp, andouille sausage, and pickled veggies. They also had versions with just veggies and with brisket. In addition to all the usual breakfast choices, they have flat bread with brisket, pork belly, among many others. I had a fabulous roasted eggplant sandwich with arugula parmesan potatoes. Very busy but absolutely worth the wait!<//Review>

I went here for brunch last weekend. I had the California omelette. it came with bacon in it and avocado on it. I tasted my friends Meatball hash it was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food and service was stellar. The ambiance was very inviting and relaxing. a great place to take a date. The restaurant is in downtown La Mesa with metered parking.</text>

<rating>5</rating><review>We love coming here. They always get us seated fast, the decor is super cute very rustic, barn like antique style. My family came in to town from Texas and my little sister suggested we come here again before they left. Win win!

Con: Mason jar water cups have a funky smell. Perhaps getting a wire rack to place the Mason jar cups as they dry? They sometimes have a wet or dirty cloth smell. But it still doesn't keep us from drinking from them, but we have always wanted to suggest a different solution.< /review>< Pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Came here on vacation and by far the worst restaurant we visited. The food is not that tasty and sat in our stomachs wrong. Plus it is VERY overpriced. We came to spluuurge but the quality of the food and drinks was not equal to the price. I'd rather have gone to a nicer place and pay that price. The Bloody Mary's were very small (about 6 oz) for $15!! I could've got two amazing drinks at another brunch place for that price. Also the server was very condescending and rude. When I asked for a drink she looked down on me and, in a baby voice, asked if I even had an ID. Like she was going catch me. Just ask politely if you can see it and I'll show you because, yes, I have one. I'd recommend going to another restaurant and I promise you will have a better time.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

This place is quaint and quite charming.
Difficulty finding handicap parking (my mother was with my sister and I.
The food is fresh and presented very tastefully.  You must have the iced T. for it’s very good. 😋
It was a little bit pricey for the food but for an occasional meal it suit me fine.<//Text>

The food was really tasty. We started with the jar of mushroom -olive spread..For entrees I had the stuffed sole and my husband had the scallops. Everything was good. The service however was sporadic, thats why I give them 4 stars. When we arrived we were served water, but not greeted.. After 20 min I asked who our server was and that person took our order and took care of us. Then when it was time to pay there were similar delays. Overall, we would go back when in the area and try them again.</review>

Really really good ...service was on point menu is extensive,  fresh . My bison ribeye was delicious plenty of flavor combined with blue crab cake perfectly seasoned and cooked crispy and light . Brussels sprout with a sweet burn had a lot of flavor. My guest had the short rib and didn't talk for the first 5 minutes.  My wife enjoyed the pasta of the day nice Mexican shrimp in a vodka sauce.  I had a few bites and agreed with her that it was delicious. I recommend the zucchini stuffed flowers awesome. I do that ,at home , from my garden "yum". The meat board is also a "farm to table" must for us,  Where ever we go.  SERVERS  We like when you explain what is what on board it sparks conversation and ideas. We Will put this in our dining rotation.<//review>

My first visit here I experienced the pecan crusted salad and I must admit I didn't know salad could be this good. Parking was a little tough, but I found some. The service was excellent and I will return to try other dishes. The interior is well designed without overdoing the decor.< /review>

Their food is wonderful!!! I ordered the Santa Fe omelette this morning! Im giing to give them a 4-star since their customer service was lacking. I had to track them down for refills and cream for my coffee. The coffee was excellent! The atmosphere was very inviting, pleasant and relaxing.< /Review>

What a nice lunch experience today. We ate out on the patio and stayed well into dinner time. Our server Alfredo pampered us with check ins and refills and most importantly - kindness. Although we had a long stay he never pressured us to pack up and leave. This is the perfect spot for great food, catch up time with friends, and wonderful service.  Try Farmer's Table and ask for Alfredo!!!</text>

Great spot in La Mesa village for food , drink's and gathering with friends and family. Beautiful outdoor patio, full bar, plenty of indoor seating and phenomenal service. Menu selection for food and drinks is second to none. Highly recommended to visit when you're in La Mesa.</Text>

A surprising lack of flavor. The dishes looked very pretty, and the ambiance is quite nice, but the dishes were a bit bland. Salt notwithstanding (we added that on our own), the meat in the Benedict wasn't very seasoned, the hollandaise lacked more citrus, and the heirloom tomato in the frittata tasted unripe and beefsteak-like.<//Review>

The food and atmosphere was good but every time I come here the service is terrible!!! I came back thinking it will change but it’s consistently bad! Took 20 minutes to be greeted by our server and another 20 minutes to order drinks and food. Our server seemed like she was avoiding coming to the table and when she did she was rude and dismissive. Food came out wrong, I asked for separate checks beforehand she brought everything on one check and then highlighted the tip section. The experience overall was poor, the bad service outweighs the food and atmosphere. I won’t be coming back!< /text>

Food is always amazing. Unfortunately won't go back anytime soon. Took over 30 min to recieve drinks, and over an hour on a Thursday night at 6pm to get an appetizer and a flatbread. Were very apologetic but this happens far too frequently here.</Review>

This was a great place to eat! I went here with my mom (place is very family friendly), and it was a fun place to eat for Sunday brunch. I got a Cali omelette and my mom got a frittata, we also split a half order of the tiramisu french toast. Omelette was cooked perfectly, ans the tiramisu french toast had a great coffee taste. We also got mimosas, and were able to get a bottle for $20.

I'll be back to try to rest of the menu 😊</review>

<review>I like that Farmers is casual and has a layed back atmosphere.  The service was attentive, but we did arrive around 4:30 on a Tuesday afternoon.  The restaurant filled up quickly by 5pm.  We did not have a reservation so sitting outside was not available.  Our table was fine I just felt packed in when it started getting busy. It's awkward when people have to squeeze by your table to get in or out of their table.  Our drinks were tasty and as expected.  The salad I ordered was a tad bit on the salty side so that was a little surprising.  The meatballs were a good portion as well as the side of mashed potatoes - all not crazy amazing but as expected.  Granted we did not have a full meal this time, but we will go back for that later.  I'm really looking forward to sitting at the outdoor bar too! All in all - a great addition to downtown La Mesa.</review></record></dataset><record>

Over priced and food wasn't worth the price. But it was alright. Bloody Mary's were ok. I've had better. But the customer service is awesome. We had the nicest server. I wanted to try this place at least once.<//Review>

The wait time on a Sunday afternoon are a little long. The food takes a little long to get there, but I don't mind waiting for good quality food. The staff is friendly but our waitress forgot the pancakes, the potatoes are very good. I got the chile relleno omelette and it was ok. I will try something different next time.<//Text>

This place is fun! The food is decent, and they have a good selection of food, craft beer and fun cocktails. What I liked about this place is that people young and old like this place, and the atmosphere is buzzing without being overly noisy. I may not always remember what I ordered at this place, but I'll always remember that it was fun.  10/10 will return!<//Review>

The pizza that was ordered at our table would have been excellent, if it was hot, it was marginally warm. The first problem with the Bacon Mac & Cheese did not have any bacon. On top of the missing bacon, it was cold...not room temperature, it was cold. We had no issues with any of the other items we ordered. After the food was served, we did not see our Wait Person again, until the bill was presented.</text>< Pics>

Wonderful new place in downtown LA Mesa. Chili relleno stuffed with shrimp omelette was awesome and the myriad flavors of the short rib, eggs Benedict over lemongrass polenta was amazing. This place is also dog friendly.<//Text>

The food was perfect. The family and I enjoyed every bit of it. Customer service was 10/10. I'd definitely come back. The French Toast was so moist. Hot chocolate was okay. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. First time in here and won't be the last time. Parking was easy to find and wait time wasn't long too. It took us 10 mins to get a table on Saturday.</review>

Great ambiance. There's an open air bar that is perfect for a nice lunch. I had some truffle fries that were nice and crispy as well as a kale chicken salad that was a new thing for me but was definitely worth the risk.

Want to check it out during the evening.< /Review>

<Text>Want to take a guess how many steaks in a $50 steak dinner for two? 1 little one because "that's how it's supposed to be."

There are so many better places where I can get a single steak for $50. At least I gave you a chance to make it right.< /Text>< time>

A nice addition to the City of La Mesa. Country charm, service and tasty unique foods. Only 4-5 parking spaces in back, so bring change for the metered street parking 👍 Outdoor patio seating and dog friendly too!</Text>

<text>I do love this restaurant and have been here many many times, but this last time left a bad impression.
We ordered the octopus appitizer and it was cold and plated very poorly. They replaced it with a very good one, but it was so strange how the plating of the first one was so bad.<//text>< Time>

I adore this spot! They offer tasty food, their menu is decent, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I love a lot tasting all their food. The dishes are consistently fresh and tasty, the service towards the guests  is agreeable. I often go to  this place and I was never discontended. I recommend this place.<//text>

We had a long wait because we needed extra seating on the patio but, my god were we glad we waited. Staff was excellent and food was out of this world. The tiramisu french toast was amazing & the bloody mary was so good it was more like getting a pickled side salad +a drink. We had brunch with a party of 6 but wished we were local so we could go back for lunch and dinner too.<//Review>

Food was alright, as usual these places put rosemary on everything and goat cheese.  Kinda pricey but large portions.  Atmosphere was nice.  Service great.  Had an awesome sangria.  Nice to try once but wont go back< /Review>

We have been here many times but this trip was for the specials for San Deigo restaurant week.  Holy cow and all of it too.  We really anticipated more of a tasting 3 corse meal but were blown away by the portions, in both the meal and the wine pairings.  The food was amazing as always, the services was top notch as always, and the restaurant is welcoming and friendly.  It was very full for a weeknight but we never felt rushed or ignored.   We enjoy our newest neighbor and look forward to many more great nights out.   Thank you.< /Text>

Very homey place with kicked back service.
Food is awesome, creative and changes as locally sourced ingredients become available.
I had a seafood pasta with a giant prawn on top. Unfortunately the prawn's tail was missing and that disappointing. Still we will return. Reservations are recommended.</text>

3rd time I've been here. I went with my office group of 5 and 3 of is enjoyed our food thoroughly but the other 2 were disappointed. We went durring lunch time and I called ahead to make a reservation but our server took very long to bring out our food. The table next to us was seated about 15 minutes after us and they got their food before us so something  was off. The hot Mexican mocha was really enjoyable not too sweet.</Review>

I had the eggs Florentine Benedict style, and a tasty bloody mary on the early bird special. The Florentine tasted like they were trying too hard to be fancy. My girlfriend had the breakfast burrito, to much egg, like everywhere, but decent. Server needed to back off on the Italian shower, great place for La Mesa.< /text>

We came here for my mothers birthday dinner. Great place. The food was great, but the duck liver pate had too much wine mixed in, which masked the actual taste of the liver. Servers are attentive and quick. Would definitely come again<//Review>

Lively atmosphere with friendly service. A bit of a wait but not unreasonable.  Parking can be a challenge.  The menu has  many  choices including gluten free. Prices are fair. We all enjoyed our selections.< /review>

<text>I liked the duck wings, the service was great! The pizza was decent, crunchier on top and chewy on the bottom.

Went back for restaurant week. Service is solid and friendly. The food was more for an older white palate.< /text>< Response>

<review>On Christmas evening my mother, my roommate, and her daughter, and I decided to try our first dining experience at the Farmers table as we heard great things about the restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted nicely and seated quickly. Greeted by our waiter five minutes later was an older male early 50’s with glasses with menus and asking what kind of beverages we would like to have. As it was busy on Christmas he arrived 15 minutes later to take our orders. Forty five minutes later he had returned to tell us there was a misunderstanding with our order and he had asked us once again what each of us had ordered (since it was Christmas we all considered this a simple misunderstanding). Another thirty minutes goes go and I ask the waiter what was going on and to speak to the manager since it had been over an hour upon us being in the restaurant and seeing that the guests who arrived twenty minutes after had already been served. The manager named Rudolfo had let us know that the kitchen just received our order and was working on getting our order out fairly quickly. Another thirty minutes goes by and our order had come out and I had ordered a ribeye medium rare, my mother had ordered the ahi, my roommate and her daughter had ordered sides such as the pizza, brussel sprouts, and mac and cheese. Needless to say my Ribeye was clearly rush just to be cooked on each side and the was not cooked medium rare, but was RAW. The other orders were cold and was clear that they had been sitting for quite a long time. Once AGAIN I asked the waiter to talk to the manager Rudolfo as we had been in the restaurant close to two hours. I let him know how unsatisfied our experience had been and how my ribeye was cooked RAW and the rest of the orders were cold. Rudolfo was angered and did not show one care to our experience and when I asked him if he was to experience what we had with his customer service how he would feel on Christmas and his reply was that he liked his steak close to raw and that he could not send the food back to the kitchen even to be rewarmed. Never in my experience of dining had I experienced such ignorance and rudeness from a restaurant and the fact that he could not send it back to the kitchen to be rewarmed and cooked. Needless to say he stated that there was nothing that he could do and we could leave, or we could re order and wait another hour. I have never experienced such disgusting customer service especially form a restaurant that I have heard great things form and we all left disappointed ON CHRISTMAS. We had left feeling discriminated and flustered on a holiday that should bring people together.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPioKPW8k6EU6lDoG5eCV6pXKlHLQikGhBaUGRG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp34PdFgs48-T0ZmZnRN9hqHbfhdb78SYMLtLn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2< /GmapID></record>

Located in the heart of downtown La Mesa is farm-to-table restaurant. My husband  ordered the chili relleno omelette which was filled with shrimp, green chili, queso fresco and drizzled an incredible sauce on top. I ordered the zucchini ricotta pesto frittata. They also serve lunch and dinner which were definitely going back to try. They have a full bar and an wonderful selection of bloody Mary's. My husband couldn't decide which one to try!  Excellent service, definitely worth trying.</text>

<review>Party of 2 on a Saturday evening around 6pm. Drinks, appetizer, and food were all tasty. We saw our neighbors food and wished we would have ordered theirs instead. We didnt fill up but were content. Our server was spread a little thin so we had long waits in between seeing him but he did try.  Will come back again but for drinks and brunch appetizers only.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Outstanding service, atmosphere and location. Breakfast was good, decent portions. Variety of breakfast options could be improved,  i.e. add crepes to menu. Prices are reasonable. Easy access from street, plenty of parking nearby. Will definitely be returning and trying other menu items. The setting and architecture a bonus.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I love the decor here. It's farmhouse shabby-chic like you might expect from the name. I've never ordered anything that I didn't think was delicious. The bananas foster French toast is a top contender for my favorite dish here. They have a gluten free wheat bread that you'd never know was gluten free. They also have a heap of really good cocktails. If you're a fan of bloody Marys, you'll love it here. It's a bit on the pricey side. If you are going to have a drink, expect to pay about $35 per person.< /Review>

The server was really nice the brussels sprouts were kind of overly olive oil. The lemon drop was excellent. The Manhattan was not that good. The steaks were overcooked and really chewy. My husbands calzone was really bready and not a lot of stuff inside.  Way too expensive for the food quality.</review>

It seemed the hostess had an off night as she did not acknowledge my seating request twice and then walked off with our menus. The drinks were good and so was our waitress. We tried a few appetizers, drinks and main courses. Ended up sending one app back because the quality was under par and the other app was dull (bison tar tar). Little lemon juice fixed that!  We also had to send back my over cooked, pork chop jerky. After that, we packed up the other entree and went home.<//Text>

<text>Nice decor and design. Good service. Now for the bad... My special, a rabbit ravioli dish. The problem was it also came with 6 pea size bone pieces scattered throughout. The flavor of the dish was good, and I very carefully ate the entire dish, but the lack of care that let's this happen will keep me from returning or recommending to others.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Went for breakfast and it was pretty good, they have a decent selection of menu items and lots of servers moving around so it's easy to get what you want when you want.

<text>My Girlfriend took me to breakfast for my birthday this past weekend. Neither of us had been to Farmer's Table before and we were eager to try it out. The decor was great and the food coming out of the kitchen looked great. We got there early before the crowds. Took our time ordering and asked a few questions. We placed our order as well as one of the specialty Bloody Mary's. Food came out very fast and our drink came out quite a bit after. I was 1/2 ways done with breakfast. To start out my huevos rancheros were WARM AT BEST. The potatoes on one dish were very salty and the other dish they were fine! Our other entree, eggs benedict were  way overcooked as shown in the photo. I kept a bite to show our server and let her know the food was barely warm. She never came by to check on our meal! We ate and someone cleared our plates and our server brought the bill. Never asked how anything was just placed the bill on the table. She was a bit busy by this time so we paid and left. I wanted to stop and speak with the manager but my Girlfriend had plans for me and didn't want me to get in a tizzy on my birthday. So here is my take on this meal. Like I said all the meals coming from the kitchen looked great. The presentation was great, the flavor of the two entrees were great, the potatoes were salty, and the Bloody Mary that arrived way late was terrible. It was loaded with alcohol which can be great but it was cheap vodka and overpowered the mix and was not pleasant. The bacon wrapped shrimp looked like one mini bay shrimp wrapped in bacon. Hard to find the shrimp. Kind of a bummer way to start your birthday and not a cheap meal for my Girlfriend[:< /text><user>117888959405769177218<//user>< rate>

<Review>Second time I have been to Farmer's table, first for brunch ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, this time for dinner.  Sangria was fresh, delish, and generous, hubby had personal  short rib pizza 👍, daughter napoles salad and I had butter lettuce salad with fresh fruit.  All very good, and different.  Prices are reasonable but higher than average.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAXdyzmCKH15ubUcu4r2dxlZYYwPCWKjIZUR6q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Despite servers best efforts, Saturday (numerous months ago) breakfast was served with mushrooms, in spite of order to keep them off. If that's the case, they truly need to retrain their chefs to review what servers compose on an order. I want to enjoy this place, since I enjoy fresh food ... however just if the order is correct.First time?<//Text><UserId.>105448838056899521213<//UserId.><Rate>2</Rate><time>1561746309987< /time><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2<//Gmap_id><resp>None</resp>< name>

I think I just found my favorite restaurant!

Located in La Mesa, this large farm industrial decorated restaurant is located in Downtown La Mesa is  worthy of several visits.  Judging from the filled restaurant, the word is already out.  I was lucky to stumble upon it.

My coworker and I arrived here for dinner at peak dinner hour.  The menu parking lot was full but we easily found metered street parking.  We were also able to quickly get a table inside.

The interior of the restaurant was impressive in decor.  Creative farm and industrial inspired art filled the restaurant.  Everything from the light fixtures to the chairs were fun and interesting to look at.  After our meal, we had to walk around and view everything.  Enjoy my photos.  :)

Now onto the main reason to visit, the food!  The menu was awesome!  A lot of "somethings" for everyone (vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, etc.) on the double-sided menu.  Too much to choose from for one visit.

We chose the Veggie Napoleon, Farmer's Salad, a side of Burnt Carrots, side of Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, and an ice tea.

The food arrived in a timely manner, was very artistically plated, and delicious!  Our favorite by far was the carrots.  I could probably have just ordered 2 sides of them for my meal and have been happy.
The ice tea ended up being iced coffee but was quickly remedied after it was brought to the waiter's attention.

Service was good.  Our server was friendly and helpful.

My least favorite part was the restrooms, 2 single user, gender neutral restrooms for the large restaurant made for a wait.

Overall a great experience worthy of several more visits.  Just wish there were one closer.   I will definitely find my way back.</review>

< Review>
The drinks here are excellent, the main meals are solid, though I feel they are overpriced for what you get. Dessert here is a must, but I would strongly recommend sharing with someone (they tend to be deliciously rich). Atmosphere is good, but can be noisy. You can ask to be seated outside which is significantly quieter. The service has been consistently excellent. My only complaint is that the price point is high for the main meals considering what you get.< /Review>

<review>The food is all terrific. There were 11 in our group and everyone liked their food and drinks. Bloody Marys are unique and very good.  Prices are no bargain.  Delicious but definitely not economical. If you are looking for value for your dollar, keep looking. This place is worth going once in a while but too expensive to go regularly.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

We went for an early dinner.  The service was slow even though the place was only half full.  Once we ordered the food took about 45 minutes to arrive semi warm at our table. The food was OK but for the price I expected better quality and more thoughtful preparation.< /text>

Love this place! I love the vegan options.  The employees were all super nice and energetic! The food was delicious. I had the vegan ciabatta . I wish it had a little more flavor but still great! It very open and its very nice on a beautiful sunny day. Can't wait to go back.</Text>

<Text>This is an excellent restaurant. I've been for breakfast, Happy Hour and dinner and all were wonderful. Food is always delicious and the decor and ambience are beautiful, charming and cheerful. Staff are very pleasant, knowledgeable and accomodating. They are a very popular spot and can get busy in the kitchen and the dining room, but staff has always communicated any wait times or delays to me and checked in frequently. I highly recommend!<//Text>< GmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Large groups beware! I was there last night with a group of 35+.  Our waiter charged us for appetizers and sparkling water that we did not order. When I asked my colleague, who ordered the appetizers, she said they must give complimentary appetizers to large groups (nope). The 4 of us at one end of the table were paying cash, so we were on one bill. My meal was 22.50. Another colleague had a meal with water 29.00. The other two had a meal and one alcoholic beverage. Our bill was $340/85.00 each. We did argue the bill and they took about $40 off. Ridiculous. My salad was nothing special.< /text>< pics>

<date>1553708223680< /date><Resp>None</Resp><review>I have visited Farmer's Table La Mesa at least 6 times in the past 2 months and I generally like  the food, but the service seems to get worse every-time I go, and tonight was the most disappointing.  I am not one to complain but I was so frustrated that I spent over $80 and was irritated the whole time.  My server seemed very nice but was not at all good at taking care of us.  We had to flag her down several times.  She waited over 15 minutes after we ordered drinks to come back and take our dinner order.  We asked to have the heater turned down, she said "No worries" and then I had to flag her down again to ask a second time.  As soon as we got our meal from a runner, a "manager" stopped by and asked how things were and we said "fine" but we hadn't even taken a bite.  After he left we realized the soup that we ordered for my daughter was "too spicy" after asking server if the soup was spicy and she replied "No."  The custom vegan pizza we ordered had the wrong veggies and yet we were charged extra.  Also, I believe the “gluten free” pizza was not gluten free as I have been in extreme gut pain for the last 15 hours since eating. Our server not once came back and asked us how our meal was or if we needed anything.  Then I had to flag her down again to get take home boxes and the check and then again had to flag her to pay.  When I told her the soup was spicy, she apologized but didn't offer a refund or anything.  I tried to look for an email to send this complaint to so I didn't have to leave a poor review but I could not find any.  I really hope you fix these issues as the food is quite good and I would like to return in the future.  Thank you.</review>< gmap_id>

Came here on Labor Day during lunch.  Despite the crowd, we were greeted right away, waited only 10 minutes to be seated, and served really quick.  There was a lot of people, but staff were absolutely ready to not let that affect the amazing service they provided.  The food was absolutely delicious and fresh, they definitely deserve 5 stars!< /Review>

Originally added a five star review, but the most recent visit was subpar because of the food. The cream of mushroom soup was cold along with half the risotto. The daily special salmon was decently cooked but tasted watery which I assume is because it wasn't thawed fully. The fish was flavorless without spice, only applesauce on top. However, service is always fantastic and attentive. Needless to say I won't be back.</Review>

The staff was kid friendly. They placed us in a huge booth right by the kitchen. The pizza maker was very entertaining for my toddlers. It was pricey but good for a special occasion type of meal.</Review>

<time>1567665955700<//time><rating>4</rating><review>Solid place with enjoyable atmosphere. Portobello mushroom sandwich was good, with very nice and good quality sourdough bread. Tomato basil soup was also nice. The side salad was very meh and overpriced and the balsamic dressing was very mediocre and slimy but those are easy items to fix if they care to do so.

I have been there a few times and it has been a very positive experience overall, so I definitely recommend it and I will certainly be back when I'm in the area.<//review>< name>

We had my brothers brunch before his wedding here. Great service from our waitress. Our food came out surprisingly quick for such a large group too. Highly recommend.<//review>

Cute place.  They have three locations.  Very pricey.  Almost $20 for a turkey sandwich and water.  Came with a wee salad.  But do note... Fresh fresh fresh!  You can tell you're eating good food.< /review>

Happy to have this in the La Mesa area! It was fresh and airy, the decor was adorable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was good, but not the thing that makes me want to go back. I liked how bright and relaxed it was in there. I would stick with the small plates for a casual brunch:)<//Review>

Great atmosphere, nice servers, And this is a very popular place. Waited 30 minutes just to get the Ice T.  Have to tell them to Box up our food to go.  The food was excellent. I recommend the pecan chicken sandwich. My daughter's shaved chicken sandwich was also delicious.< /text>

Good food, a bit pricey but it's high quality and made from scratch to order.
I'll definitely come back.
It's popular and thatmeans theirs a wait, but it's worth the wait :)<//review>

Fantastic food. Great decor. Went on a Friday for birthday.  It was also restaurant week. Place was packed.  Very loud . Could hardly hold a conversation.  Drink a bit more wine . Talk louder. All in all a very splendid evening. Will definitely return mid week sometime to really soak in the atmosphere and food. Delicious!< /review>

The food is decent, a bit overpriced for what it is. The service is mediocre at best. We sat down, waited almost 8 minutes for a server to bring water. When we did put our order in, we waited almost 45 minutes for a burger and some eggs to come out. Meanwhile we saw a full table sit down, order and have their food come out before us. My wife and I won't be returning.</Text>

<Review>What a great place!  Served by the energetic and personable Riva, who truly made my first visit a good reason to return!  Very helpful with the variety of menu items, Riva made sure our choice to share the delicious Egg Sandwich and Florentine Benedict were served to us already split without asking ... so intuitive and caring.  Top this off with a surprise birthday serenade in Italian (thank you, Rosario!!) and candle to blow out, a complete surprise compliments, again, of thoughtful Riva!  Good food,  friendly environment, but, most of all, service from the heart!!</Review>< Date>

Wow, what a really cool place to eat! The atmosphere is out of this world!! The decor is rustic with a shabby chic touch. They really didn't miss a beat with the decor matching not only the name but delicious food. And the food, what can I say other then amazing!! We had quite the selection when we went. From the meatballs to the cheese board to the flat breads and to the burnt carrot salad just the name a few. Not a single item was disappointing! Everything was flavorful and the portions were right on! The cocktails are unique and delicious and will have us coming back for more! The staff was on top of their game and super friendly! Job well done on this new place in La Mesa! It is now our top 2 places to eat at!</Text>

The wait staff are unfriendly, don't look you in the eye, don't smile. Their words are friendly and helpful but their attitudes and demeanor are completely opposite.
The cocktails were very good. The food was good, nothing spectacular but good and it came out quickly.
This was my 3rd visit and, though I didn't review the first 2 visits, my review would have been pretty much the same.....cocktails very good, food good, service and personality of wait staff very poor.<//review>

<text>This place takes you to Europe for the mealtime. The food is great, and the atmosphere is amazing! The rustic decor just makes you wanna redecorate your own kitchen and dining room as soon as you are done enjoying the whole experience at this place. A huge plus for me, I can always practice my Italian with the servers, who are friendly and fun! Oh, and dogs are welcome on the porch!

I really enjoy the atmosphere and vibe of this place. The food is on the upscale side so the price is comparable because of this. Both times I’ve been there the service has been a little slow though. I enjoyed what I’ve ordered with the calzone being a standout. There’s Limited parking behind the restaurant and limited parking on the street, but it’s a quaint area. Especially nice walk around during the day.<//review>

Food is amazing!! We sat out on patio.
The service was great! The Squid/ Calamari Special was spectacular!! We have traveled several countries and added a 'Best Calamari' section to our book & this plate just swam to the #1 spot!! Definitely our new dinner spot for when we come down this way! 💟</review>

I must say...this is one of the best places I've eaten at in a long..long..time!! The portions are generous...and the quality of the food was delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. Not once did I feel like I was waiting for service. Do yourself a favor and stop by Farmer's Table for an incredible experience.</text>

Good but extremely overpriced. Ribeye steak was $47. Was good, but for that price I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris. Paid almost 200 for three people.</Review>

I’ve been here so many times, it had the best service, food was perfect, until today..
My friend and I, and her baby got seated down in the corner. The baby was between us and our server came up to us & suggested that we moved the baby because “it was unsafe” where she was, we nicely declined and said she’d be fine, we were close to another table, so then she said we wouldn’t have room so I scooted her closer to me. Then she said the server has to go in between our 2 tables to get to a table behind us. (Mind you, there is no room for anyone to scoot by with the table next to us) and as she was telling us two males walked right between the tables behind us and had no issue delivering food so we said thank you but it’s okay. She then started to move the baby, grabbed her high chair and everything until my friend told her not to touch her.
I said “are you making a suggestion or telling us to move” and she just stared at me then walked away. Another lady politely asked us if we had been helped with drinks or anything and we said no so she got us some. 15 min later our server asks us if we were ready so we ordered then a guy brought out our order. My friend needed hot sauce but our waitress was nowhere to be found so I got up and found it  myself, as well as silverware she had to go find a guy to bring it to her. Not once did Kayla (our server) ever check back on us. Not one refill or anything. So 15 min after we were completely done waiting for our check we got up to get it ourselves, I give her my card and she charged it, I go to sign and put a tip and the tip says “6.64” and I’ve been here so many times to know that I write the tip in myself so I asked a guy about it and he said “no no you do the tip” and looked confused. And she looked at me rolled her eyes and said “I’ll change it don’t worry” so a mgr came over and he got filled in he was very polite and kept apologizing. I simply asked Kayla why she did that and she kept repeating herself “it’s fine I’m sorry” and I was like it’s not fine, you’re stealing my money. And she says “no its not for me it’s for the host& cooks, etc” and I was like “ok but you tipped yourself without my consent that isn’t okay whatsoever” and she said “it’s fine” so I asked to talk to mgr by himself, he was very sympathetic, shocked that that even happened. I told him I loved coming there and I would be back but she will never serve me again. So if you ever get her you might as well walk out before you sit down😇 mind you, I’m a manager at a restaurant so I do know what’s expected out of employees, I’d fire her on the spot that’s for sure!</Text>

<Review>This review is about breakfast only, I have only been here once and the a late breakfast. The food was great and felt the price equaled what I ordered. The coffee was pretty good as well. The bloody Mary and other drinks looked good. I will have to try next time. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was for service, waited close to ten minutes before anyone came to the table. The food runners that are there to help the servers need more training. They would see empty coffee and water glasses and never ask if anyone wanted more. Leaving the server to do everything. When dropping the food off never asked if everyone had everything or needed anything. Not just at my table but the entire section I was in. It was like they didn't want to interact with the customer. I am hoping management works on the small things with the staff here.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Life is not better on the farm as the art suggests on the wall at the back of the restaurant, where I was seated. I waited at the bar to be served over 5 minutes with no greeting or hello, not even an “ I will be right with you”.  There was only two people seated, one being myself.  The waitress eyed me but never spoke.  She busied herself without a word; talking to the other waitress and once the other waitress departed, she never acknowledged me.  Pity on this place again! I am well versed with the food, service and quality therein.  From burned radicchio pizzas to veggie omelets, where the veggies were just tossed in the fold of an egg not in omelette form. I still returned.  I’ve dealt with eating  my breakfast with welcomed dogs sniffing my food nearby and rubbing against my leg hinting for me to throw him a bit of food. The General Manager knows me all too well.  He too agreed that an omelette should look different and done accordingly as well that they were removing that pizza of the menu due to many complaints.  I’ve returned because I actually like the place and the ambiance. I wish they would just get it right, it’s a great place otherwise.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The farmers table is a must try if you haven't already done so. The parking was scarce and all metered for 2 hour max. It was crowded about 11 a.m. but we chose the bar to sit at and dine. The blackberry lemonade moonshine was so good that I questioned the bar tender of alcohol content, ordered another shot to be added and still, delicious! The food took a bit to come out but when it did, it was clean and delicious. I found it to be a tad expensive but the drinks and food were top notch so I say worth it. I'll definitely be going to the farmers table again.</Review><Date>1542460923950</Date>< response>

Really quaint neighborhood restaurant with excellent gluten free pizza.  We went just for their great, homemade, gf dough.
They have a nice menu, ample seating, both inside and out, are pet friendly, and quick.  Their prices are on part with other pubs.
Try them out... I'm sure it will be a hit!< /Text>

<time>1561511406861< /time><text>Pizza is the best anywhere, though the mascarpone French toast was a bit shy of that prized cheese.
Nice bathrooms, meter parking on street fits maybachs easily.
Intriguing boutiques nearby.
Drinks and, to some extent, breakfast fare are overpriced for their value and quickly hike tabs.
They could fit 3-4 more tables in if they moved the tractor from dining room,  and possibly cut the constant 1-2 party wait there always is.
Dining room dusting appears to have been omitted among responsibilities, maybe leaving positive static charges detailing with proper tools could make once a month sufficient as they aren't powered objects that harbor it.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>4</Rate><username>Christopher Wellnitz< /username>< userid>

Hubby and I went for breakfast, we were seated right away. The servers were fast and friendly. I ordered orange juice and the egg sandwich, wow. It was a meal plus, OJ was fresh squeezed, the sandwich and potatoes were delicious.  Hubby had the Cali omelette. We will be going back soon to try the other menu items.<//text>

First time we went, the service was good. The food - nothing special. The second time we went the food was not good at all. Hastily prepared and it showed. The service was horrible. Saving grace here is cool crafty drink menu. Probably not going back. I feel that this place is hit or miss becuse I see a lot of good reviews. Maybe we are just unlucky?<//review>

Yes, friendly service but the food was a big way below average and over priced. 1) My bf tried their special, salmon and it definitely was not worth $35 2) Do not come here if you’re vegan, they have one maybe two options. Their one vegetable Napoleon is the worst vegan dish I’ve ever had. We ordered a side of house fries as an appetizer, which came after our entres and were beyond undercooked. We were so disappointed as we’ve been wanting to try this place for while. They said their vegan dish was new but I’m not sure why it didn’t go through various tasting tests?  Definitely not coming back or recommending.< /review>

A pleasant surprise coming to downtown LA Mesa!  Looked very inviting and we went in to check out the  menu and "Viola" we stayed for a late breakfast at 1130.  Amazingly fresh, healthy food. Very creative and not only pleasing to the eye but also for the pallet!
A wonderful find and a new jewel for La Mesa!<//Text>

Changed my rating from 2 stars to 3. They've improved considerably. They finally have happy hour and the servers/bartenders have had a chance to settle in and get comfortable with their menu knowledge, style of service. Unfortunately the poor bartender is usually by themselves until about 5:30/6pm so during happy hour, you could be sitting without a drink or food for awhile. The bartender is simply too busy. As soon as they remedy this I'll edit my rating once again<//review>

<Text>Great decor and most the food was tasty however the corned beef hash had a lot of fat on the large pieces of meat. This in addition to the too large potatoes would keep me from ordering again.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><GmapID>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2</GmapID>< user_id>

I booked an event in the private room (which didn't feel very private--it was very open to the rest of the restaurant, but lovely other than that) and Leila worked with me to book the room and select the menu. My guests were very impressed with the whole experience. I highly recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Last time I ate here it took a really long time to get our food and when I did get it, my eggs were cooked wrong.  I needed to have the eggs Benedict with a well done egg because I am pregnant, however they did not do that.  Not really a big issue but when I sent it back and they gave it back to me the eggs were fried and both times it didn't come with the English muffin it was supposed to.  Other then all the mistakes and not really getting what I wanted the food here is really good.<//Review>

Previous visits have taught us to ask for a quiet table in the back. Food was greatn as usual, and service acceptable. The place is usually busy, so staff are hustling. So glad to support places that serve seasonal, local foods.< /review>

Great service and delicious food. A bit on the pricey side. Up to $9 for a pint of craft beer. We tried their vegan and vegetarian options which were quite good! The coal-fire pizza has awesome crust, and the vegan ciabatta was tasty with garlic fries. I appreciated their dedication to the reduction of plastic waste demonstrated by the paper straws and compostable to-go containers. Nice going, Farmer's Table :)<//Review>

The ambiance, terrific, super bloody marys, but their food, while FRESH, QUALITY ingredients just misses the mark. It's not terrible by any means but COULD be great & it isn't. Have tried the eggs benedict (didn't finish), the personal pizza is ok, just ok, the pecan encrusted chicken breast on a  big salad, an abomination. REALLY wish this place was better!< /review>

This place seems a bit over the top for me but I gave it a shot for lunch.  First off the place is nice to look at inside and out but that is where the good ends.  We were seated quickly and waited at least ten minutes until the waiter came over to take our drink orders.  He informed us of the specials took our drink orders and did not come back for another ten plus minutes.  The place had maybe twenty customers counting the seven at my table so they were not swamped.  The drinks arrived, our food orders were taken and we waited a reasonable time for our food to arrive. During our wait some of us consumed our beverages and had nothing else to drink. Our waiter was no where to be found again.  The food was okay for four of us but the others had cold fish served to them and one did not receive their meal until some of us were almost finished with our meals.  I would not tell someone that this is the place to go even if they had a gift card in their had for the place.  I will not be back.<//Review>

We eat at several restaurants and we are never ones to complain.  We went here from reviews ....we will  never come back. Staff friendly just that they don't follow through.  This was a week day.

<Text>I can not say enough about how great and interesting the food and flavors are here. I would be here all the time...if it weren't for the staff. I don't think I've ever finished a dinner here in over a year without my server having to go home and offer to get me the bill before they go. Tonight, a man came over and yelled "who's on the diet?" before dropping off a diet Coke and 2 chardonnays. Our waitress found it funny to make our lobster shell dance before taking it away. 1st world problems I know, but the food and the atmosphere just doesn't match the level and mood of service. I'll keep going back, don't get me wrong. I just hope the staff can move past the cringe worthy behavior.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>Super friendly staff and crafty food. I had their short rib Benedict with truffle potatoes and it was delicious. The meat was so tender and juicy and because of this place, I will never eat potatoes without truffle now.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Absolutely love this place, it's the perfect brunch spot with all kinds of delicious food. Very trendy atmosphere in the heart of La Mesa. It is vegan friendly and has some delicious drinks to go with the great food. Service here is awesome, the servers are so friendly and make the place even better with their good vibes.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I went with my wife for a late lunch today. I had the short rib eggs benedict and she had the breakfast jambalaya. The food was very good. I don't know quite what to expect from short rib eggs benedict but they delivered it well just the right amount of meat and Hollandaise. The eggs were cooked perfectly. My wife too, was surprised at her Dish and also found it quite tasty. The restaurant was clean and pleasant and if I had any critique to make it would be about the wait staff. They were definitely competent and overall friendly. I would advise them in the future, on hot days especially, to make sure and get your patrons drink orders right away. And maybe stop in to check on how our meal is going part way through the meal and smile. Only about a third were smiling.  So I will say on The Food level, we haven't had time to try their Libations yet, I would definitely go back again.</Text>

I have been to Farmers Table several times since my friends like it and I live about two blocks away so it's convenient. The food is good, not great, overpriced, and would probably be better if you could get it in a timely manner. The staff is mostly very friendly but for some reason completely unable to provide good, efficient service. Appetizers often appear after the mains, and in one case, after dessert. In my experience you are better off walking across the restaurant to the bar and ordering a drink since the servers typically take forever to bring your drink order. The decor is nice but this place has been LOUD every time I've been there. Typical trendy restaurant problem, all hard surfaces with sound bouncing from everywhere. It's probably much nicer outside but the weather has thus far prevented me from sitting on the patio. I don't hate this place and they seem to have potential due to an interesting menu and good drinks, or in other words, the product, but so far I just don't get what people are seeing in this place.</text>

Get place for date night or a small group. Food is great! I didn't give it 5 stars because i looked into this place for a bigger gathering and they charge a reservation fee which doesn't apply to any food or drinks that will be ordered. No thanks! I will just stick to date nights for this place.<//review>

Leila and her entire team were graciously accommodating to our group of American Cancer Society volunteers.
We hosted a 30+ person brunch at the La Mesa location this year.  Everyone raved about the delicious, colorful and thoughtful entrees serviced on that day.
Highly recommend you take family, friends and co workers to this fun restaurant!<//text>

When we first walked we liked the atmosphere and the hostess was friendly.  It was a busy night, so it was a bit loud. Nonetheless, the gluten free pork bellly pizza was amazing and the marinated artichokes were delicious. We would go back if we got a different waitress.  She was not very friendly or attentive. However, other servers were quite helpful in her absence. Overall, it was a positive experience.<//review>

the bartenders can make god drinks but the food is lacking.  There is nothing that is amazing and had that wow factor; however the pizza crust is very good. It is a cool place and a good concept, if only the food was good.< /Text>

<Text>This place is very nice looking and the food tastes pretty good. The service was good too. However, it is just another trendy place that servers similar off the wall items. While that usually appeals to me, the menu here felt pretty lacking. Nothing jumped out at me making me way to try it. Their Bloody Mary's definitely sound interesting, one has a whole chicken? Overall, this place for some it might be very nice for others might want to pass.<//Text>< pictures>

The food was very good. There are a ton of options, including veggie options. They also have some delicious drinks. There are also a ton of handsome servers here. A rare plethora of good looking male servers.< /Review>

Servers are very nice. They serve organic produce. Bread ingredients are not organic. They have some vegetarian options. They do take a little long bringing the food once you've ordered so just be aware to be a little patient. Food is very good. Artisanal drinks made here. They are very good. Some parking spots in the back otherwise street parking is available. I would definitely come back again :)<//Review>

For breakfast I thought there was a concerted effort to rush us along although the place was no where near full. Coffee was excellent and plentiful. The food has been good, flavorful and filling. For dinner we had made reservations to celebrate a birthday. When we arrived a bit early for the reservation it was very crowded and we waited over 30 minutes. When we were finally seated the table was very uncomfortable. Stools instead of chairs with backs. The table was cute little car like thing that was made into a table. We could not put our legs under the table and had to sit sideways. Had we known ahead of time that the table was so uncomfortable, we would have waited for another table or we would have left. I know it was no ones fault but it ruins the dining experience if one is so uncomfortable rushing through the meal is the only escape. We emailed the restaurant about our experience. The response was not very empathetic. Next time, if there is a next time, we will ask first to see the table.<//text>< Pics>

Good meal.  The steak torta had lots of flavor.  The kitchen forgot to make it so it took a while, but they didn't charge me to make amends.  Our server was very attentive</text>

<date>1516572780557</date><name>Sammuel Marotta</name><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Great food and impressed with taste and presentation.  The ultimate downside is that I made reservations on a Wed for Saturday night.  We arrive 15 min early and are told that they are busy but our table would be ready at our reservation time. Our table was ready 45 min after our reserved time and all we got was sorry about that. Sat us by the exit door that waiters used to go in and out for the outdoor seating.  Extremely load in the back corner against the kitchen window.  Soup, stuffed mushroom and a personal small pizza with no drinks came out to $50. This is the third time I tried it and all three times disappointed.  Giving this place a break for a very long time.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Maybe because it was Monday. Not impressed with service or menu.  Name implied to me more of a "Farmers Table".  Felt menu limited but food pretty ok.  Best part of dinner was a Moonshine Blackberry/Basil ice tea. Don't think I'd make a point to go back, better choices in area.<//Text>

Great Place to have a Pizza and A Beer! Limited Craft choices but still, ok.
I've been there a couple of times and the 1st time service was great, the 2nd time, our server was "ok" but not great. Hopefully 3rd time will be the charm! I'm confident it will be.< /text>

<review>Went there for Father's Day hoping to enjoy the food and I was completely disappointed. There were flies all over the place, our cups and silverware had dirt stains, and the food was sloppy. I ordered the shrimp omelette and the shrimp was not even peeled. I had to open my omelette and remove the shells from the shrimp myself. In addition to that, my husband and my son got warm food instead of hot. Not to mention rather than relax when eating, we had to spend the whole time swatting away flies. At least other open air restaurants have blowers to keep the flies away. When we got there my daughter was so thirsty and just wanted a glass of water but it took about 10 minutes just for the water to come. I will never eat there again. I suggest you take your business elsewhere. As someone who grew up in La Mesa I expected better food. DO NOT EAT THERE!!!!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

The food was awesome as always, BUT the noise level is off the charts. That's true at the Bay Park location as well. No idea what can be done to resolve at this point, but I probably won't be back and, when asked, I always recommend the food but the noise makes it too difficult to really enjoy the experience. Too bad.</Text>

Unfortunately this is the second time I've visited this restaurant. The sandwich is way overpriced and I do not think it has any flavor. I had the pecan crusted chicken sandwich with blue cheese and avocado. The avocado was sparse, the blue cheese overpowered everything so I really couldn't taste the flavor of the chicken. No seasoning just rather Bland. Ordered the side of fries and they were just so-so. A sandwich and a salad no drinks 35 bucks! Ridiculous!<//review>

<Review>The blossom pizza is tasty. Gluten free crust is da bomb. Burnt carrots have lots of flavor. Ordered grilled octopus but the seasoning was bland (maybe they changed the ingredients). Sent it back and got duck wings which had great flavor. Busy so had to be patient for our waitress. Normally a 5 star place, but this visit was ok.<//Review>< pics>

The first time was for dinner several months ago, and our experience was fairly decent which is what prompted me to return the second time. They served us great cocktails and tasty food and service was great. The second time I went, I excitedly brought my parents who were visiting from out of town. We ended up waiting 15 mins longer than our reservation. We all ordered seafood dishes, and all our fish were overcooked. To top it off, it was very pricey and after our talk with the manager, one dish of the four was given a discount. The third time was a family brunch and we waited half an hour after our reservation time to be sat. The service was atrocious, drinks took forever to arrive, and the food was nothing to write home about. The fourth time was essentially a repeat of the third visit. We went at 9 am so it wasn't much of a wait, but everything else was basically the same. I kept returning in hopes that maybe they got their act together, but unfortunately I haven't had a wonderful experience here since the first night. It was exciting to get a new and fun restaurant here in San Diego, but the novelty has appeared to have worn off.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Great restaurant. The Burnt Carrot salad is to die for. Really awesome. We went a bit early (a little after 5 pm) and had no trouble getting a table right away. Our server (thanks Sam) was attentive in just the right ways and friendly. Everyone working there seemed to be enjoying themselves. I like that. Definitely will come back often...if we can.</review>

Ate here for the second time.  Delicious fresh food, pleasant atmosphere, attentive service.  Maybe even too attentive.  Between our server, two busboys, and a manager, we were asked how we were doing 7 times.  A bit excessive, but we prefer that to the opposite treatment...heh heh.  We'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!  Love the indoor/outdoor ambiance, too!</review>

<review>Love the ambiance, friendly service. We had no reservation on a Saturday night, but we were able to eat at the community table (party of 6) or you could eat at the bar or patio. They were completely booked with reservations until 9pm. Recommend the charcuterie board as a group appetizer, and the salads and pizza were great. They are working out kinks, but I am confident it'll settle down, be running smooth, and they will be successful!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2<//Gmap_id></record>

I went here for brunch with my mom and we both loved it! The restaurant is decorated so cute and I love their saying "farm to fork" it's so cute and is a fun play on farm to table. I love that they even have a tractor inside!

We got a bloody mary and mimosa and both were great. The Tijuana Maria was very instagrammable! It even had grilled street corn on it!

For food, we got the turkey benedict and the heirloom tomato frittata which were both 10/10. You could tell how fresh everything was. Make sure to save room for dessert because we got the nutella bread with strawberries and bananas which was so delicious!

The service was also amazing, we got everything we needed and more and everyone was very accomodating which is hard to find these days. Special shoutout to our waitress Riva.< /Text>

This place had a great open atmosphere. There is nothing better than farm fresh food and this place brings it. I had the savaletti and my girlfriend had the flat bread pizza. Both dishes were delicious and fresh. We both had barnyard mules. Great drink. I would recommend this place to anybody.<//Review>

I ordered my burger medium, and it came out well done. The fries were almost cold when they came out, and were more like salted cardboard than fries. Our server came for our drink order then food order and we didn't see him again until after our food was delivered. When he came to the table he left napkins and hot sauce and started to walk away without even checking if we needed anything. No reason for me to go back.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Nice change of pace new-Italian for La Mesa, but they've been here for >year and the menu hasn't changed so I'm bored already. Also I've been to lunch there a few times and the lunch menu wasn't any great shakes. Even after all that I still give it 4 stars because it's a nice, modern restaurant.< /text>

<text>The food here is excellent. Great quality great service and awesome selection.  Plus gourmet bloody Mary's. This is truly the new Jewel of LA Mesa.

After eating i had to add to the review.  I love a place where the chef personally comes out to ask how the meal was.  I am in love with this place.  I could close my eyes and feel like I am at a winery in Napa Valley eating here.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2</gmap_id></record>

Chicken liver mousse was sour, the bison tartar was under seasoned. Served on an avocado that was not even close to being ripe. The risotto was under cooked and tasted like it was cooked in an aluminum pan that gave it the aluminum flavor. They need to step up their game.< /Text>

<Review>This place is relatively new, it was packed and it could be that they weren't completely prepared for this. So far all their staff is extremely friendly and attentive, wait times are typically  15 to 30 minutes- I would recommend to call ahead for reservations or use open table apl. Beer selection is good. You can expect to spend something like 50 dollars on dinner for 2 with 1 beer/drink. The pizzas seem to be popular, sadly they ran out of pizza when we were there. But then, I guess, they went to get more? and we were able to change our order back. It did take a lot of time to get our food, but our server was extremely attentive and kept bringing water and table bread meanwhile. Sadly, when our food arrived, the kitchen missed one of the orders, and when the order got placed again, they sent us back the wrong dish. Food tasted great, and server did compensate for all the mistakes that happened. Overall I think we will be back to try other dishes, and will likely update my review depending on that experience.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Farmers table is as charming and wonderful as its owner. The dishes produced from his kitchen are delicious and you can taste the quality of the ingredients he uses in each dish.  His burrata jar and grilled octopus are a couple of my favorites I would highly recommend. We are lucky to have such a wonderful place to enjoy so close.</Text>

Went for brunch. Service was just ok. The bananas Foster French toast was good. The Bloody Mary's have a lot going on and I'm not sure I appreciated it. The place has a nice ambiance. I think I'll go back when it's been open a little longer.<//Review>

<Review>Ok the food and atmosphere here is simply divine. The servers are genuinely kind and loving. The pizza is profound and all the dishes are so freah and have some elegant abd gourmet twist that makes them irresistible! So glad this is in la mesa! The baby spinach salad and heirloom tomato pizza are incredible if you like simple things.</Review>< date>

<Text>Beautiful restaurant, great drinks, but my food experiences here have always just been OKAY. My favorite dish has been the stuffed french toast. My husband and I have tried lunch, happy hour and dinner but every thing we order is simply mediocre. Staff and service is great, but if you don't have reservations be prepared to wait in a small waiting area, or crowd around the bar.</Text>< name>

<Review>The rib eye steak $38 was burned.
I thought first  they put too much salt but when I flipped it over I saw right away what was going on. It appeared as the chef put that burned side down so the customer can't see it. Well, I did, but it was too late. And when I say burned, I mean really really burned.</Review><userid>111282299366763130074< /userid><time>1547662497788< /time>< Pics>

<Time>1527273211706<//Time><Text>I heard great things about this place, and was quite disappointed. Not sure if it was an off night, but all the food was just okay, and the seafood pasta was all over cooked and rubbery and our stuffed artichoke app still had the thistle which we learned the hard way. My watermelon cocktail with a splash of lemon was more like lemon juice and vodka. Our server may as well have been a robot. No smile, no personality, minimal words in response to a question, hard to flag down to order a glass of wine and never asked how we liked anything. Sadly we will not be coming back.< /Text>< user>

<Text>I have never felt so humiliated or discriminated against. If I could I would give 0 stars for the treatment I received at this establishment.
My coworkers and I went to eat dinner and throughout the whole evening we were being rushed. We were rushed to order our food and then rushed to leave. We had finished eating after having been there for about an hour and a half/ two hours (we were a large group). Once we paid, we were still finishing our drinks and conversing at our table. Our waiter, Brad, then came up to my coworker, tapped her on the shoulder and said "Hey ladies, you see that line of people? They are all waiting on a table. Thank you." We were essentially kicked out of the restaurant because there were other people waiting to be seated. Even though the group sitting next to us had been there longer than us, we were the only ones told to leave. We were also the only people of color. My coworkers and I felt humiliated at the behavior of our waiter. It was quite obvious the prejudice the staff had against us because we were people of color. We can not believe we were treated this way and we will never return to this restaurant.< /Text>< pictures>

My Favorite is Pecan Crusted Chicken Sandwhich ( hint ask them to toast the bun with blue cheese on it in oven) becomes a Blu cheesy party chicken and I you eat pork it comes with bacon ( I don't ) but if I did I would probably add double bacon and make sure to get the truffle fries.

This places is fresh and has good parking. It does get crowded goes to show how the management really does care about their business.<//review>

The 1st time there was perfect (Mothers Day Dinner), the 2nd time, almost as good. Wait staff was lacking. Food perfect (oh, 36th anniversary). Maybe I'll order the chicken next time?</Text>

It was a fun atmosphere, if you like to yell across the table. but the food honestly was just lacking. The lamb meatballs were gamey. The margarita pizza was a disappointment. The server then took the food to box it then never returned and apparently threw it away, because he couldn't tell us what happened to it. Between 4 adults and 2 kids, we all agreed not to return. I think the thing here is just a place to show off style. They don't have a kids menu, so I would advise this as maybe a better place for adult drinks since it's so loud and the food menu isn't reliably good for a meal.<//Review>

The idea of going on a Saturday evening was not the best idea if you want to talk to your friends. Very loud. The food was really good. The prices were a little high but what isn't these days. $40 for a ribeye plus you then need to buy salad, etc. Our waiter was nice but way to busy to be able to really care for each tables needs. The building is amazing and remodeled great. I will say, all of the emplyees (with the exception of the first fella we met at checkin) were happy, said hello, thank us for coming, etc. That part was top notch.<//text>

Nice place with great atmosphere! The food has been really good the 4 times I have been. The only problem is the wait staff is disorganized. Twice I have been sat on the patio with bad experiences with either a very slow waiter or one just not coming to our table at all.</text>

Get a couple friends and order the Barn Yard Bloody Mary! Pitcher of delicious housemade bloody Mary with what seems like a pound of bacon, cheese, olives, tomatoes, and A CHICKEN! Not kidding! The Tijuana bloody is also great but beware of its spice! Overall atmosphere of this place is amazing! They've taken old farm equipment and made it chic. Really like this place!< /review>

I will start this review with the following: overall the food is good. However, VEGANS and VEGETARIANS beware.

I have recently moved towards a plant based diet for personal health reasons. I’m not the perfect follower of this diet so this issue wasn’t huge for me.

Many items on the menu are/were marked vegan vegetarian when they weren’t. For example—I ordered a vegan benedict. I was surprised when I saw eggs and the sauce definitely was cream based. I asked the server why this was marked vegan and he said it was an error. I asked why he didn’t tell me when I ordered and he kind of shrugged. When it was delivered I said something to the busser, he tried to tell me eggs were vegan. I let him know they were not and he insisted they were.

I will reiterate that the food and ambiance are cool but I just think the restaurant needs to be very careful how it labels the menu<//text>

The pecan-encrusted chicken sandwich was to die for!  The mojitos were great.  The veggie black bean burger was so-so.  Nice breakfast menu too.<//Review>

The decor is absolutely the best part of this place. The service blows, bartenders are as fast as snails and the food is just ok. I've been 3 times and really only come back due to its location and the decor.< /Text>

Food is good,  service is iffy at best.   There are a couple of attentive servers but that is the exception, not the rule.

Went with friends for lunch today and it was not even close to full. We had to hunt down our server to get more drinks.  Sauce on the side request did not happen and we didn't see the server again until the end of the meal so there was no way to correct the problem.

After we waited 45 for our breakfast, with no coffee refill, on a previous visit my husband refuses to go back.  If I didn't love the food,  I would probably agree with him.</text>

The flat breads are pretty good but small.  Enough styles of beer to make a nice pairing with many of their meals.< /text>

I was very disappointed in this restaurant, even though friends told me repeatedly that it was great. I ordered the heirloom tomato flatbread, and the tomatoes seemed soggy and less than fresh. The worst part was that the pizza was visibly covered in salt, to the point that it was so salty I could not even finish it. It looked like someone spilled a salt shaker on it. My friend suggested I send it back, but since it had taken an hour just for them to bring out the food (on a Wednesday night), I elected to just throw it away instead.< /text>

Excellent attentive service! Food is a wonderful interpretation of farm-to-table dining. Lava cake is now my favorite version; a bit less cake, very sensuous lava! Buffalo steak was an over the top success. Best I've ever had. Thick, perfectly cooked filet mingon type cut, soft and delicious. Noisy friendly atmosphere. Beautiful outdoor evening dining when they open the walls to perfect weather. Lovely!</Review>

<Text>Portions are okay. Bartender (Ashley) was friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. Although she did forget my fries, when they came out they were overly hot and soggy as of they had been microwaved to get me leaving ASAP. Also, I'd expect fresh ketchup or something less heavy than high fructose corn syrup from a place that's selling a fresh menu to me.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>This place looks cute, the out door seating is nice, and the service is ok but the food is super underwhelming. Our omelette was rubbery and the potatoes bland. The plates and mason jars we were drinking out of smelled “eggy” and looked unclean. One of the specialty pizzas we had with ricotta and caramelized onion was pretty good but overpriced. Would not recommend this place highly.< /text>< pics>

<Text>!!!!!!!! This place is amazing,(still going through starting pains but excuse them!). I had the clams/mussels app and it was amazing. The margarita pizza is to die for. The buccatini is engrossing,(though could use more eggplant). I love this place after the first visit.

I want a pickup pizza option!<//Text><GmapID>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2</GmapID><user_name>Fngrs Rpicks2</user_name></record></dataset><record>

I was really unimpressed with the food. I got a pizza and salad to go and I was really, really disappointed. The cesar salad was literally 2 tiny hearts of romaine with a small dressing. There were a lot of parmesan shavings -- but they were stale, chewy and inedible. It was a total waste of money. The pizza was soggy and bland. I'd love to see this restaurant be successful but I don't think I'll be visiting again.<//text>

I had to go back for the Pork Belly Flatbread, it is AAaamazing.  Their drinks are great, I enjoyed a watermelon something, and a Tie Me Up. Delicious. One of their specials they had when I went was a Bison Fillet Mignon, I didn't order but the table next to us did and it looked just beautiful ( and they ate it ALL so it must of been good :-)< /Text>

The atmosphere is great. Service was a bit slow, but since when does Ratatouille have rice? I was so looking forward to my meal and out came a dish with mostly rice, with a 'cheesey-like' sauce, scattered with a few vegetables. It was very bland. My husband 's pork rib flat bread was sort of flavorless too.</Review>

<text>Ok, changing my review yet again. After a bad couple of first experiences, they did improve and we're quite good for a time. It now appears we are back down to a poor quality. Shrimp pesto pasta was inedible, swimming in butter and the shrimp was off. And where did the awesome short rib tagliatelle go? In its place is a lackluster meat sauce that I can easily best at home. Want to like this place, but as it is it is currently waaay overrated and way over priced for the quality of food.<//text>< gmapID>

First time was pretty good. 2nd time poor service, mediocre food at best. Bartender was more concerned about talking with her co-worker than taking care of customers.This was during the day.
Step it up!< /Review>

Went today for lunch with my sister. This place recently opened and has a great feeling as you're walking up. It's not confusing, it seems open and inviting. Like some of the hip restaurants in the North Park like area, they focused on all the right things; ambiance, food and service. There were plenty of people buzzing around making sure everyone was being served and at one time a gentleman who I think was the owner asked how our lunch was doing.

I had a steak flatbread with a horseradish drizzle and my sister got an omelette that had onions, spinach and prosciutto with black beans. The flatbread was exactly what I was craving, the taste of the dough and how much it was cooked was PERFECT. The punch of the horseradish wasn't overwhelming and just added to the steak. My sisters omelette tasted fresh, as the name suggests. While it wasn't an assault on your taste buds, the freshness of the ingredients spoke for themselves and made her dish divine.

I'm delighted I had such a good experience here. I know I'll be back again to check out their dinner menu soon, it's just down the street from my apartment!< /review>

Great concept poor execution. The waiter forgot to put our order in and finally realized an hour after we had been sitting there. Then it took another 25 minutes to get our food. His offering to make up for his mistake (which he never admitted) was to give us our drinks free. I had club soda from the fountain because they were out of Pellegrino and my friend had iced tea.  I understand mistakes happen but not taking ownership of it and offering no real compensation was the big fall down.</Text>

Got seated after 15 min.wait ... server kept walking by, but no water poured- sadly he didn't approach our table for atleast 10 minutes.** service is lacking. It took forever for a different person to bring us two glasses of wine ordered -wine sat visible to me, for a long time at the main bar. *Cavatelli: pasta was tough/ dry + lacked sausage bits. Upside: decor is mod-rustic.  May/may not give the place a 2nd chance.</text>

<name>samuel kelly</name><time>1514927167210</time><Rate>1</Rate><review>The food here tastes ok and the atmosphere is aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately that's where the pros end for this place. The list of cons on the other hand is not quite as brief.The service is slow at best, at it worst, it's non existent. After several visits with the family I realized the norm is for waiters to significantly delay in bringing your drinks or to forget your them altogether. Also, don't count on your food being correct orto be brought in a timely manner either. To add insult to injury, bad service such as when I have to remind my waiter for the third time he hasn't brought the drink menu or my wife's bloody Mary, is consistently met with a lackadaisical attitude. Wish I could say I hope they get there stuff together but as I watched the waiter laugh at the fact that there was hair in my wife's omelette today, I realized we will never be back and I just no longer care.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2</gmap_id></record>

<review>Although it’s a pretty place, and the food is pretty good, (hence the 2 stars) it’s expensive for what you get and the service is HORRIBLE. I’ve been a few times, because it’s in my town and I wanted to give it anither chance,  but went again last night with my family and it was the same routine. Initially the hostess tries to seat us literally facing the restrooms when there are multiple, more desirable, empty tables including one on the patio, which is pretty and why most people put up with the prices and service. We sat down and sat there for over ten minutes without an even, “I’ll be right with you” from our server. Absolutely no introduction, nothing. After over 10 mins, we finally got up and left. I’m done with that place, which is a shame for them because my friends, family and I are always eating out in the village and we all feel the same way about this place.< /review>< userid>

< Review>
Overpriced and over hyped. I was asking about the bison dish before ordering my food and the server told me it is raw bison. I didn't want anything raw, so the server recommended a similar dish that had cooked bison (game of the day) priced as "market price", so I opted for that. Little did I know, it came out to be twice the price of the initial dish I asked about. Let me just say, it was not worth what I payed for. The check came out to be nearly a hundred, which included my bf's lamb dish. This place was not what I expected at all. Completely disappointed.<//Review>

< Review>
Amazing customer service!

I ordered the massive egg sandwich with man candy bacon!!! Yummo!

I love breakfast so it's hard to dislike anything so I wasn't about to complain about my runny egg ( I didn't order overeasy btw) However, the waitress saw it and immediately asked me if I wanted a new egg sandwich... I told her it was fine. To their credit, I already ate HALF of the massive egg sandwich because it was delicious!! Our waitress insisted she get me a new sandwich....so she said she would talk to the manager.

A few minutes later, the manager came over, apologized and told me she was getting a new sandwich for me.

To my amazement, they made me a new one ... A whole new massive egg sandwich plus the truffle oil homestyle potatoes. I was thoroughly surprised by their level of professionalism and top notch attention to detail.

I highly recommend you patronize this farm to table restaurant....asap !!!!

PS. Their decor is soooo cute!< /Review>

<Review>Would never recommend this place. Frittata was runny and not cooked in the center, raw egg. I ordered a side of vegetables and they tasted like metal out of a can, not fresh. Black beans were canned. The bread from the chicken sandwich was disgustingly greasy. It took over a half an hour to get our food. I don't take bad comments lightly, I usually would just not comment at all. But this food will make you sick!!<//Review><time>1519786007390< /time><user>112426931744316468882<//user><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d957234461e35f:0x67efbaec05c28bf2< /GmapID><name>debbie humphrey< /name>< Rate>

One of the best places in tow  for breakfast. Best eggs bennedict in SD.  Recommend Soyrizo with Nopales as well as the french toast.  Pancakes are also very good.  Coffee is also very very good and staff are very nice ..even when there's a line I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes.<//Review>

I just updated my review from 2 stars to 5.  Whatever kitchen problems they were having in the beginning must have been ironed out.

...Too soon.... back down to three stars for the completely garbage service we got there last time.<//text>

Flies, dirty utensils, wait staff touches dogs and then handles food without washing hands.  Terrible chiliaquiles and breakfast burrito was nothing special. Home fries were really good.  Won't be back.< /review>

We went early on a Saturday night, the rain had just cleared. We waited over 45 minutes for a table for two. Hostesses felt bad but did a poor job updating us on timing(first it was 20 minutes, then it was 30). We waited on the outside of the bar in the freezing cold and the busser couldn't even find us dry chairs to sit in. It would be best to make a reservation here.</Review>

<date>1560300982024< /date><username>Vanessa Thomas</username><Review>I was excited to try this place out. While we waited for a table the food coming out looked amazing. However, upon eating our own orders it was only "ok". My husband's eggs were sickeningly undercooked. He sent them back, but when they were brought out again were still quite raw. Later he felt sick, and he has an iron stomach. My chicken sandwich was again, just "ok". The chicken was grizzly and of poor quality. The fench fries were probably the most disappointing item we ordered. They were completely soggy and over fried at the same time. Our waiter never asked how our food was and we had to flag the wait staff several times due to lack of attentiveness. I really wish I could give this place 5 stars!</Review><Rate>2< /Rate><UserId.>114159462777649646013<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I dined at this establishment with my Italian class as part of a project. I expected the service to be professional, the food to be authentic, and a decent priced meal. What I got was ignorant and lethargic service, barely passable food, and a bill for almost $50 for an appetizer of meatballs, some fries, and a dessert. I give this place half a year before it's a Little Caesar's Pizza.< /text>

Not able to rate the food because no one ever came to serve us.
I did have ample time to read the menu over and over and as usual per california style everything is overpriced.
Very disappointed.<//Text>< pics>

It was our first time and we are completely in love with the place, food and the service. Rosario was taking care of us and he is awesome. Definitely he was one of the best part of the restaurant. Everyone had a different choice and all of them it was delicious and taste. For sure it is already one of our favorite places for breakfast/brunch in San Diego. We had tradicional eggs Benedict, veggie omelette with country potatoes (very yummy), Nutella waffles (best ever) and calzone. Out of this we had blood Marie and they were wonderful!!</text>

<Review>A very fun, creative atmosphere, with foods which will entice everyone's palate, from gluten-free to regular.  You can sit outside on the patio and watch the activities on La Mesa Blvd. And, even if you're inside, the acoustics are so good that you can actually hear the people at your table.< /Review>< response>

< Review>
Farmer's Table should be called Farmer's Fable.

They do not get their produce from local farmers.  I was very disappointed when we went there for dinner.  Food was...ok at best.  Service was lacking.

They try to claim Farm to Table, but they are not.< /Review>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Noisy beyond belief!    Not relaxing.  Hostess needs to learn how to “Be like a duck, paddling and working very hard inside the water, but what everyone sees is a smiling and calm face.” (Quote from Manoj Arora).  She looked and acted frantic during the entire 90 minute visit.  (So did the rest of the staff).  While waiting for our table, I stood at the bar to order drinks for ten minutes before the frenzied bartender could even acknowledge me.  Food was OK.  We did enjoy sharing a large table conversing with fellow diners.
Overall experience - Unorganized and not ready for "Prime Time"!<//review>< Pictures>

Food and service are outstanding but the din is deafening. If you just want a great meal and don't care to converse with your companions, wear earplugs and enjoy.< /review>

Attempted to go there last night, but we were sent away.  "We're not taking anyone without a reservation."  We were a party of two.  No offer of a seat at the bar (where there were plenty available).  Plus, it was early and they weren't super crowded.

I'll give it another chance later, but don't try to go if you don't have a table.<//Text>

I like this place! The food ranges from acceptable to outstanding. I’ve had only lunch and dinner there but I’m sure the breakfast is great, too.
Some standout dishes:
Pork Chop: awesome. Nice thick generous slice of meat. Cooked and seasoned perfectly every time.
Pizza: surprisingly good. I should mention that this place is crawling with Italians. Most of the waitstaff are Italians. One of the waiters serenaded diners with classic napolitano music in a mellifluous operatic tenor voice. So the pizza comes out of a wood fired oven, more or less Italian style. Good sausage. Good broccoli rabe. Order one with their excellent selection of draft beer.
Grilled Octopus it comes with a white dressing like yogurt. The menu tells me it is actually “lemongrass celery root pure.” That would be my first choice for octopus but it works. The octopus itself is always grilled PERFECTLY. Slightly crispy texture on the outside, nice al dente texture overall. $16 is a *little* steep, but in fairness, good fresh octopus doesn’t grow on trees. I keep ordering it so ...
Fish sandwich. The fish varies so ask what they’re serving when you order. They grill it — tasty and serve it with delicious French fries. Awesome hot lunch.
Other items on the menu are less than fabulous but always good. Service is always good. This may be La Mesa’s Best eatery. Definitely give it a try.</Text>

As a Mexican, I only eat Mexican food in Mexico. This had to be the exception, the choice of ingredients specially the cheese used ✨< /Text>

A friend arrived before me at 3 and was seated at a table had a cou ple of drinks. I arrived and we went ro the outddor/indoor bar. My friend was charged full price vs happy hour price for his drinks.  2. While at the bar I started to ask about special drinks amd the male bartender told me to read the menu.  He was not interested in engaging in conversation.... it's happy hour... at a bar... conversation is part of the gig. 3. Lastly, the same bartender never went around to see if we (or others at the bar) wanted another round before happy hour prices stopped. He checked 10 minutes after and then said, the special price is over.  The pizza we ordered was great, the service was very poor.  The bartender was not "happy."</Text></record></dataset><record>

Food was decent but very overpriced.  Service was subpar.  Had to go to the bar (which was slow too) more than once to get a drink because our waiter was inattentive.   Pretty sad on a Monday to have to do that.</text>

<review>I've had brunch and dinner here and both times the food and drinks were great! The people are friendly and the place itself is very cute. My only complaints are that if you sit inside when it's full it is really hard to hear and the tractor table was uncomfortable to sit at because I couldn't fit my legs under the table. However, I will be back!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

They forgot the bacon (and lied about "no bacon being on the receipt) then they were rude about it (making my mother uncomfortable about their error), they gave us over easy eggs in the sandwich instead of the scrambled eggs my mother ordered (they apologized, but didn't fix the sandwich, as if the receipt and my mother were lying) the bacon we ended up getting apon our return was burned, my French toast was burned, and their marscapone was bland. Overall, the food was still good dispite a few short comings because the  quality of the ingredients shined through. I enjoyed the meal enough, and I didn't get that " this is just an expensive Denny's" feeling. Though it was far from worth the $48.00 (after a $6.00 tip on a to-go order that was all kinds of wrong) paid for 4 pieces of french toast, some strawberries, 1 order of home fries, one egg sandwich, and weak/ rude customer service. At least my company was top rate.</Text>

The ambiance and outdoor seating are the best partand that’s were it ends. Service was very nice but the food was disappointing🤷🏽‍♀️ The eggs were rubbery, potatoes bland, and the cups we were drinking out of were dirty. Everything smelled very “eggy” and not in a good way. Not a place I’d return to or recommend</text>

WARNING WARNING - PARKING IS HORRIBLE
My grandfarther has a shop right next door so im familar with the parking issues. Please be aware you will have to park and walk. But hey, its worth the good food and atmosphere.

Brunch with my grandparents at this place. They did an excellent job renovating the place. HUGE difference from the prior pizza. Tons to look at, neat light fixtures and tables. Interior space is a little tight. The food was Delicious. I had the kale burger (they used mixed greens instead which i prefered) excellent! It was exactly what i was craving in a burger for a long time, fries were okay. My grandmother ordered a steak sandwhich which looked excellent. Papa ordered a chile renos shrimp dish, he proclaimed its excellence and abundance. My husband ordered the stuffed french toast which he enjoyed. Overall the food was GREAT. Service was good. Will add photos of food.< /review>

< Review>
This was our first visit to Farmers Table since their recent opening.  We live in the village of La Mesa so we had to check it out.  First impression is good... nicely appointed modern rustic decor, and friendly staff at the hostess table.  We had reservations, and we got to our table within five min. of our arrival.  I had asked to be seated outside when I made the reservation, but that didn't happen... and I rather wish it had because this place is pretty loud when its full... and it appears to be always full!

We ordered a nice bottle of Castro cab... at the recommendation of our server.  Very nice, and not a bad price for a restaurant.  We started with the seasonal charcuterie  board, and everything was very nice... three types of cheese, two types of meat, and an array of fruit as well.  Not an overly large portion... perfect as an appetizer for two.   Then we tried the fennel sausage pizza.  The flavor was excellent.  Everything seemed very fresh and we really enjoyed it.    The crust was really great... maybe another 10 seconds in the wood fired oven to make it perfect.

This place is a great addition to the La Mesa neighborhood, and we will be back for sure... and next time with friends.  We will have to try sitting outside next time too.  Since spring is upon us, that should be wonderful.</Review>

Beware of water on floor. Noticed a few places. Ask twice and hostess will make it a point to wipe it up. Not as good as previously.<//review>

Food was awful. We were a table of 9 and everyones food was pretty bad. I ordered their special which was biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. The gravy looked awful. It seemed like it was made with cat food. The gravy was bland, watery and just awful. Potatoes were bland no flavor. My daughter ordered an gluten free pancakes because she has celiacs disease. When all the food arrived my daughters food didn't. I had to ask the waitress for her food and she went to go check on it. She then came back and started telling her they didn't have any gluten free pancakes and they only had original pancakes and was trying to convince her to get them. I got upset and told her she could not eat them and instead of offering her a menu tried to tell her she could have a salad then. I told her we needed a menu. She then ordered an omelette which was overcooked and full of huge pieces of potatoes and undercooked bacon. Everyone else's food was not very good either. I understand why their was no wait. I will never return. The food was also very overpriced. The best part was my mimosa.<//Text>
