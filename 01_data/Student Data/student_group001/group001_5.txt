<review>I gave one star because I have to give at least one star in order to leave my review.  I ordered buffalo wings.  They were soggy.  Buffalo wings should not be soggy.  They should be somewhat crispy.< /review><GmapID>0x80916b0e5aade38d:0x55a7d6234531dff7</GmapID>< Resp>

<Review>Domino's has the best pizza in town. There always quick and fast. Almost a perfect order everytime. 9 out of 10 it's perfect. I always order on line and the delivery drivers are always kind, friendly and very professional. I tell EVERYONE who wants to eat pizza that you guys are the best. Thank you Domino's keep up the good work.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I’ve order pizza from this place 4 times, first time huge bubbles, understandable since I’ve worked at a pizza place before, second time  super light toppings , third time PERFECT... fourth time ABSOLUTELY NOT! I order chicken and spinach and 3 out of 8 pieces of pizza (medium) had chicken the rest were some spinach and 1 HAD NOTHING BUT SAUCE.
This dominoes lacks attention to detail and consistency wish I could say better!😫</review>

<time>1578263126241</time><Text>Something messed up online.
I NEVER order Parmesan twists...my husband hates cheese. I am extra careful to click on Garlic Twists when ordering online. However, when I pick up, they are always Parmesan. The last time this happened, I gave them back, stating that they should have been Garlic. The casher said I ordered Parmesan so I checked my email confirmation, and sure enough it said Parmesan, even though I KNOW I selected Garlic.
Also, we have had missing dipping sauces several times...ones that we pay extra for.</Text>< UserId.>

If there was a way to give them zero stars that's exactly what I would do.  There are food safety issues when you serve ice cold food especially poultry.
My mom in law has church tonight so she thought Domino's would be a good idea. She ordered it from the app, 35 minutes after it left the store it arrived and we don't really live far, within 1.5 mile, our pizza was squished on one side and all the pizza and wings were ice cold. And they didn't even put a decent amount of wing sauce u can literally see how cold and ripped off we feel by looking. She didn't want to go to church hungry that's why we had no other option but to get through it.  We are all very grossed out and disappointed in our Atwater Dominos< /text>

10/10 was one 6 kids 7th birthday today, so pizza was a must. Ordered 3Lg 3 topping pizzas for $7.99 each. 1 pizza was supposed to be all pepperoni for all 3 toppings. What we got was a regular pepperoni pizza. Thanks Dominos!</text>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Friday night, we all needed pizza, yes the family.  So we called and ordered a large family pizza.  Good price, was delivered correctly and quickly, but the taste wasn't spectacular.  I know for a fact that these pizza's are made in about 7 minutes.  Even though this is the case, I still was happy with the pizza, especially my kids.  Once I had 2 beers in me, and was working on the third, the pizza seemed really good.  You should try em if you want to stay in, and you want a decent pie.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Ordered a pizza online for carryout. When I picked it up, the cashier gave me attitude. I ordered two ranch dipping sauces and she took one away.  When I told her I ordered two, she glared at me and put the second one back with my order. So I was a little upset when I left that I forgot to check my pizza. So when I get home, I discover that my pizza isn't what I ordered. I call the store and explain the situation and the manager said that they would make me another pizza that was done right. When I came back,  I gave the old pizza back, and got the new one. The lady that did the swap also gave me attitude.  I will never order a pizza from this store again.<//Review><rate>1<//rate>< pics>

When I came back,  I gave the old pizza back, and got the new one. The lady that did the swap also gave me attitude.  I will never order a pizza from this store again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80916b0e5aade38d:0x55a7d6234531dff7<//Gmap_id></record>

I really love the fast service delivery or carry out, the price is also very affordable. My favorite is the thin crust pizza not to mention stuffed cheesy bread is delicious.<//Review>

I have ordered at least one hundred pizzas from the Atwater Domino's over the years and not once have they messed up an order.  The delivery people are always polite and we wouldn't think of getting our pizza from any other p[lace.  Thank you!<//text>

<Review>Shanee beavers is the worset delivery. She didnt answer her phone. She was at the wrong adress. She wanted to bring me my same old pizza that was already 30 minutes late. The manager defended her and didnt even care why i was getting a refund until i asked for the drivers name to leave a review. When i got transfered to her she was super rude and went off on me on the phone. I had to tell her to calm down. And she ignored me after that and was quiet the whole time like if she hung up.</Review>< Pictures>

Love there hand tossed pizzas. However, will not frequent Merced store. I will drive all the way to Atwater to pick up my pizzas because they honor website coupon and Merced won't. Cheaper in Atwater.<//Review>

My husband and myself we're not happy with service and our pizza. We ordered two phillysteak sandwiches and  large combination pizza. It was suppose  to be on the special extravaganza. When placing the order we were not told that they didn't have the sandwich bread. Yes they did try to call us back to inform us they didn't have the bread. But we were unable to get to the phone. But what was disturbing is when my husband went down there. He went through the drive thru. While waiting in drive thru he watched employees pass by without asking him if he needed any assistance. And the employee at drive thru just walked away and sat at the counter. My husband knock on the window to get the employees attention. At that time an employee came to the window and explained about the bread situation and stated that they try to call twice. And made it seem like it was our fault we didn't answer the phone when they called about our order. My husband asked about our pizza. The employee told him that the pizza was made and ready.but since we didn't get the Philly  steak sandwiches we would have to pay full prize for the pizza. He wasn't even offended  any comparable to the special offer at the time we called in our order. My husband frustrated  just paid for the pizza and left and he came back home without sandwiches and the pizza was cold. And he was not given a receipt either.  Now in the past we have always been satisfied with our service and food and been going to the store inAtwater ca. 95301 for years.  Myself who's a manger who  works at one of the biggest fast food restaurants this kind of service would not be tolerated. I'm hoping this will be corrected. So we can continue getting our sandwiches and pizzas at the Atwater store. In the future.

Thank you,<//Review>

ordered two pizzas and two subs online.upon arrival and paying for order was informed it would be another ten minutes for the other pizza,both ordered at same time  so do not know why it was not ready.I was the only person at drive thru and there were no other customers in store. lot was empty.getting home found out one pizza had been cut into little squares and was overcooked on bottom and it was thin crust..subrolls top and bottom did not match. one was a flat bread type and other regular.top was longer than bottom. other sub was not even cut in half all the way. american cheese was not on one sub that was supposed to have everything.when she handed me order she did not apologize for the wait /I usually get two twenty dollar orders a month this last one was 27..When I say last... I Mean last...never ordering there again. too aggravated to download the pics at moment.but have them on phone<//Review>

<text>There is a lot I evaluate when ordering a GF pizza. This was my first time ordering GF from Domino's. It was excellent. A crispy crust is very important when it comes to GF pizza. If it is soggy then it makes for a terrible experience. Thank you for delivering a great pizza and faster than others and at a lower price!</text>< userid>

I specifically asked for my pizza to be boneless and as I was biting into my pineapple topped pizza I had to stop my bite midway because there was a big fat bone in the middle of the pizza. Never again dominos.< /text>

This Jews are so unprofessional they need to fire the whole crew. I been getting Domino's my entire life and today was the last day. I can't taste the difference between. Domino's crust and little Ceasars. What ever they did just guarantee Pizza Hut a new lifetime customer. Thanks a lot Domino's...< /Review>

I placed an order of a medium pepperoni pizza and they forgot to place cheese on my pizza, and it came out burnt. When I called to get my order fixed, they said there’s nothing they can do about it and wouldn’t return my money.< /Review>

Been going here since I first came to Islam. It's not a giant Masjid and if you're not looking hard enough you'll miss it when driving by for the first few times. It's home to a lot of local Muslims and its easily a place to make a new friend and have coffee with them. It's a nice simple little masjid and its like a second home to me.<//Text>

This is a Sunni mosque with a good community. They have friday prayers, Iqama begins at 1:15pm and jamaat starts at 1:35 pm approx. The entrance is a bit confusing, but once you reach the spot, just enter through the black gate. I like the mosque, it is more than the pictures it contain on google maps.< /Text>

< Review>
I took shahada here in 2010 when i was a teen. The imam was very kind and shahina, who he had directed me to. Its a very humble and small mosque, but i love it. The people here are welcoming and i never felt left out like when i go to big mosques somewhere else. They gave me islamic books and helpful items to learn more about my new religion.
I cant wait to go back and visit this mosque once im back home in CA.< /Review>

Peaceful masjid, many pious & friendly muslims, after i met them i felt like i am in my own place. If you can pray/visit this place, i strongly recommand to do that as many times and as long as you can. I felt like  regular involvemen with this place will spiritually upgrade a person to a height that is not possible from many other masjids.< /Review>

I don't usually like to deal with workers at stores because I prefer going online or making calls so I prepared to be at Cricket for a while but I felt very welcomed when I entered the store being greeted by Jackie. I had questions about my plan and possibly adding another line but with Janets and Jackies help I was satisfied with the answers and I left pretty fast. All in all I had a great experience, I really liked the environment and I wont hesitate to stop by again.< /Text>

There's no negative star rating so 1 is all this buisness deserves.

My mom came to this location out of curiosity to see how much she could save in comparison to her then current provider.

The rep managed to sell her on the cheap service rate. She then went into the prices of the phones this threw my mom off since she spent so much on her previous GalaxyS5 phone so she said she would come back when she could afford a new phone.

Well the rep jumped into sales mode and told her she could use her phone after minutes of stalling it was obvious the phone was not compatible with crickets chip the rep told my mom her phone was old and could not work and she should trade it in for a credit for the new phone. My mom a nieve senior believed this greedy sales person then she asked my mom to sign a "WAIVER" saying she gives up her right to reclaim her phone.

The phone she was given was a cheap knock off at 40% off because she traded her GalaxyS5. I went in to reclaim her phone and the manager David said the phone was already taken to headquaters and we were SOL.

I asked for his business card he said he had none I asked for his district's managers info he said he had none. This estblishment preys on nieve consumers then protect themselves with waivers once consumers had figured they have been screwed.

The worst part is all the people who work here are young taking advatage older seniors.<//Review>

<Text>They must not want business, I called them on a Tuesday Morning and spent 30 min on the phone with the Person going over all the details of my 3 cars and home looking to get a Quote on new Insurance. Followed up the next day and was told a Email or Phone call will be sent, No Reply. The next day I call same thing. So today is Friday and I was told they would call me back and go over my Quote and NOPE no Phone Call or Email. Now I'm looking over the other reviews and see others have been treat just as bad. Its not easy to go over all the information they require to quote you but if you cant do it say so and don't waist our time.<//Text>< pictures>

Amber Molina has been such a great help going through the process of getting mortgage insurance. I'm new to this whole home insurance/car insurance deal and Amber took her time to explain everything to me in a manner that I could understand. She is great and will keep going back to her when I have questions. Thank you Amber for helping us out and getting us our best deal.< /Review>

About 6 months or so ago I went in to get insurance for the first time with my Dad and brother. Amber Molina helped us a lot and the process went pretty quick despite her having to juggle three different customers and our multiple car insurances and home insurance being done all at once. Family has been messed with in the past with other agencies but not this one. Payment was processed quick and easy.< /review>

Amber @ Massey Insurance Services is the most awesome agent in the high desert.  She worked with me till she found the best fit for my needs and budget.  I highly recommend her.

<Text>Insurance is insurance at the core -- a blanket of coverage, yet, not very different.  However, selecting the RIGHT Agent is a key component.  AMBER Molina expedites the process promptly, and makes it EASY.  Although, she may provide and facilitate insurance services, Amber and Massey are keenly aware they are actually in the "people" business.  THAT'S the difference!!

I absolutely LOVE Massey Insurance! I'm about to renew both my policies with them for a third time. Their agents are AWESOME and really take the time to make sure that you're taken care of, comfortable and give you a clear understanding of exactly what you're getting with your policy. Even going as far as making sure to give you discounts that can apply, saving you money. Who doesn't love that, right?! Especially Amber. She rocks! Never met a more polite, and professional insurance agent. I like the fact that they care enough about their clients that they send them courtesy cards for Christmas, Birthdays, etc. Plus, they give you the chance to enter into some pretty awesome giveaways. I recommend them to EVERYONE I know. Wouldn't go anywhere else!<//Review>

I recently (June 2012) switched to Massey for two reasons: 1. The prices were great and well in my budget, and 2. I had a great referral from a client who has been with Massey for over 5 years. I am very pleased with the politeness and courteousness when calling in about questions and how fast I get responses. Thank You Massey. Have a wonderful Holiday Season!<//review>

<username>Juan Meza<//username><Review>Overall had a bad service provided by a specific agent under the name of Dea Gabby. Was not cooperating when processing a request and started giving attitude when requested to speak to manager. Agent was providing inaccurate information spoke to mercury directly and settled the situation myself. Before hanging up the call I requested to speak to their manager and agent refused. It would be appreciated if when handling and discussing information with a paying customer the agents are not rude. If I could give 0 stars I would.< /Review>< rating>

I was having the worst experience with my policy when my account was held with another brokerage company called ISU Insurance. After calling my insurance company they directed me to the most near insurance brokerage firm that they utilized and I called Massey Insurance Services. Within a few seconds I could tell that I was speaking with a professional who was a master at her profession. Amber Molina has been the best Insurance Representative I have dealt with. Thank you for the peace of mind with an effortless transaction.<//Review>

Amber Molina was so helpful in getting me the insurance I needed and for a lower price. I called around and got quotes from 21st century, geico, AAA, Costco, liberty mutual, Esurance and AIS. She was helpful and without being over bearing or trying to sell me things I did not need.</text>

I've been insured by Massey Insurance for several years and I find them to be friendly ,helpful,trustworthy and eager to help with all my insurance problems. I shopped around before I came to Massey and  I' m glad I did because nobody else compared to masseys dedication to making you feel important and getting you the best savings on all your insurance needs.My agent is Amber Molina she has always been there for all my needs.

Horrible insurance company.  Is not up front and honest with you about anything.  Tries to send you bills and collect money from you with absolutely no explanation of what they are from.  The owner gets extremely rude with customers when they have a valid concern and are just trying to resolve an issue.  Not willing to take any actions to try and help the customer out.< /review>

Reliable, efficient, professional, are just a few qualities Massey has proven to
provide our commercial business for the past five years. I highly recommend
them to anyone who is looking for a company that truly cares for their clients needs.</review>

I've had no problems at this location, company's do have a few bad-apples, this is nothing new to corporates. I am a professional myself. Just like Any other job, front staff does their best in helping customers in their utmost professional way, very friendly, knowledgeable, clean atmosphere and hey....sometimes, specific staff is having a bad day, But keeps smiling at work. NOBODY is perfect. I would definitely recommend this Carmichael location anytime. Bad enough this world is gone haywire with COVID-19 and the Whitehouse is a "circus". So...Keep it one Love & Pray to make it another Aloha  day.</Text>

Just look at which employee was at the reception of the parcels on Saturday and ask him for the parcel that was not counted by the tracking number!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Never answer the phone. I placed a mail hold through their 800 number and the lady from the post office called me back later, she was very rude and stated "we dont do that". You don't hold people's mail like it states on the website??? After explaining the situation to her she finally agreed but mentioned "you have to keep track of it, we aren't gonna do it for you", ok that is fine, I have the tracking #'s. Go and check Amazon's tracking and they report "Undeliverable, mail lost by carrier". I may just move out of Carmichael to avoid this place, losing Amazon packages is one thing but now I have to trust these people with any serious mail documents as well.</review>

<text>They Left my unit parcel key in a different mail box, in a different apartment mail box first I was told it was delivered to a different complex, now they are saying no wait it’s mine; packages are stolen, then say it’s not their fault their carrier was irresponsible for putting the key in the wrong mailbox for another tenant to take. They tell me to take it up with the Police, how am I supposed to when you keep ignoring my inquiries and won’t give me detailed information to file an accurate report! I bought that medication with the last of paycheck! 😞</text>< Pictures>

I’d like to rate it higher but there’s an employee there who does not wear her mask over her nose and works the front counter. I’ve seen her a few months apart doing this both times which leads me to believe she’s always doing this. There are also employees walking by in the back area not wearing masks at all. Pretty important considering how many people are passing through here.<//Text>

I like my mailman but I always have missing or very late magazines. I pay a lot for weekly may subscriptions. I suspect someone who works in the office is stealing or incompetent. My mailbox has a lock so it's not mail theft.< /review>

Best postal service in the country. No other postal service can compete. This particular location has a large, easily accessible lobby, lots of parking, and a really nice, alluring aesthetic. The quick letter drop even has its own side street.</review>

It was horrible. I had to send 2 small packages by today, so i stood in line.40 minutes. Only 2 registers were open. Poor managing. I’m paranoid of Covid and there were ZERO steps taken 😡 only floor marked near the door. Not one all the way to the back door. Then 2 lines formed for the self Mail for small packages. No signs, no X’s . I felt unsafe the whole time. Worst visit ever. Shame on that post office. Horrible experience, just horrible. I pray I don’t get sick from it. 😩😩😩😩😩</Text>

Not too great if you want to wait by a door to pick up mail/inquire about P.O. Box.
Waited over 20 minutes and nobody came up to open the half door (where you ring a loud buzzer) to help me.
Someone rang the bell many many times on my behalf because I didn't want to be (that guy) and still nobody to be found.
I get we are busy especially during these hard times, but there was just no kind of service to be found at all and that just sucks because someone could have at least came from the back and let me know it could be a while.
Hopefully this changes in the future =/</Review>

<Text>This post office, located off one of the busiest streets in Carmichael, is hosted by a wonderful selection of mail women and men. They are an upstanding group of professionals who understand how to keep a smile on their face when evil and uproar might be coming from your's. More so they do not hold a grudge, and are willing to provide excellent service to that same person the very next day. The few complaints which have surfaced are representative no further then themselves. However, the many more compliments represent the infinite number of untold brilliance who are those that make up this postal station.< /Text>< user_id>

<review>I have been using this post office most of my life, never really had any big problem though today was a different story.  My husband is in the hospital and I had gotten a yellow slip in my box saying I have a package. I stopped on the way to the hospital to get it, the half door hours start at 8:30. I rang the the bell at 8:31 knowing it shouldn't take to long to get it. After ringing the bell I could hear multiple people from the other side loudly groan or say "no". I then proceeded to wait another 5 minutes and no one came. I had to leave as I didn't have time to stand there all day.  I lost a little respect for that facility today :(< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809adc225a40c25f:0xa9302a254045704b<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>I have a wonderful mail carrier! When he has a package to deliver to my door, he also brings the regular mail. All the other carriers will bring the package but leave all the regular mail in the box. He always greets me with a smile and doesn't leave my neighbors mail in my mailbox.  The problem is the Post office moves the carriers around. I hate it when I get a replacement or stand in.
I experienced a lost package this past holiday season. It said the package was delivered, but it wasn't  delivered to me. A neighbor brought it over to my house later that day. NO WHERE on the post offices website, is there a place to contact them to ask them, where they left my package. They don't want to have to be that accountable.
It wasn't my regular carrier that delivered that package. He recognizes my name and knows where I live.</review>< Pictures>

Everyone here has treated me with the up most respect! A special thanks to Lauren, my fine mail carrier, and the other pse guy who always works alongside Lauren. Lines are how they should be expected BUT each employee is a downright PRO and has extensive knowledge of their position. Like someone else wrote...I have NEVER had a problem here. Also, I am very grateful for the new traffic light which helps those exiting the lot leave MUCH faster now.< /Review>

She had the attitude that she didn't even want to deal with me. Wouldn't let me talk and explain why I was here to pick up my package as opposed to it being dropped off. She kept rudely interrupting me saying I was out of luck because the carrier doesn't deliver to mailboxes that don't have the name on it. I just moved and they haven't put my name on it yet. She shrugged her shoulders. Then the manager walked out and she turned around and explained the situation. The manager said she would have delivered today. I thanked her.

I am only commenting on an incompetent driver who delivered my package to the wrong house.  My package was delivered five houses down from my residence.  This residence did not have numbers on their house or on their mailbox.  And it was daylight still.  How could this driver screw up a simple delivery.  LAZINESS and INCOMPETENCE.  Thankfully an elderly couple drove up and delivered my package to me.  Good thing for good neighbors.< /text>

<text>I had a package from Amazon delivered today.  We were at home.  The carrier pounded on my front door so hard that an item fell off a shelf.  I came to the door immediately because it scared me that somebody was pounding like that.  The carrier was already almost to his truck.  There is NO EXCUSE for that.  A simple knock would do.  I will be contacting the office tomorrow.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Terrible terrible terrible... my wife and I moved to North Highlands (good part) and put in a change of address over a month ago. Paid for of course. I have only received one letter that has been forwarded.. crazy... Everytime my wife calls to see if there is any mail in the dead letter area the so called manager says. No. Without checking. Another call to them and he says if the residents of my old address writes "not at this address" then the carrier sends it back to the sender????? What???? Didn't I pay for forwarding.... these employees don't care... unbelievable.. and it's pretty bad when I'm a government employee and I'm complaining... I don't get it... where's my mail??? I feel for anyone else who has to deal with these unintelligent people..</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Pretty tired of delivering mail to a person several blocks away... same street# different street. Today it was a PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY PACKAGE.  Nothing to say going in, except.... are all their faces in frown mode all the time.... This time I called & asked to have it picked up ASAP.... Lo & behold, less than 10 minutes later a very nice carrier picked it up and smiled & thanked me!!!!< /review>

If you ever have a problem with your mail service, the staff here will first blame you for the problem and they will state their is nothing they can do to correct the problem. Mainly my mail not being delivered because my apartment building is part of their training route. New personnel cannot deliver the mail correctly, and then it gets re-routed to Los Angeles and back to Carmichael for another try at delivery. The response is always the same and they lack any motivation or compassion to remedy any issue. I live across the street from the post office. What a joke....</Text>

We all have an experience with a post office that has been less than stellar.  But today, I went to the PO in Carmichael and was blown out of the water.  I was helped by Emron (hopefully I am spelling his name right), who went above and beyond any expectation that I might have had.  With it being so close to Christmas, I really think I may have had an encounter with Santa!  Thank you, Emron!</review>

<Review>I made a purchase online February 7, 2016. I used the tracking number to check arrival date. The update indicated that the package went out for delivery February 12th, 2016. It is March 29, 2016 and I still do not have the package.
I've called the company I purchased from and they tell me what I already know - the package was out for delivery on Feb 12th. I went in to the Carmichael post office to inquire about the package and was told they didn't have it but they would do some more checking. I contacted the Post Office again to find out about my package and again was told that it was not there. I left my phone number as requested and to date I have heard nothing.

Do we  have postal workers that are that untrustworthy that they are taking customers property for themselves? I have to wonder since the day my delivery was to take place my regular postal carrier(a male) was out and a female carrier delivered the mail. The products I purchased were cosmetics. I cannot help but think that she thought she'd keep them for herself.

I want the product or the $44 I spent on it and I think the USPS owes it to me.< /Review><user_id>108336961384786634154<//user_id>< Time>

I frequently purchase from Ebay,  Amazon and others. Sorry but most online prices can't be beat.  We're talking averaging 1-2 dozens orders a month.  I've been losing packages for years. They are getting my street address mixed up with another street  address parallel to my home but the same home number. I get their mail. I send it back or just drop it off to the correct address around the corner. Unfortunately, I haven't been getting my mail which I'm assuming is getting delivered at the wrong house.

How do I know it's USPS dropping the ball? All my Amazon, eBay, etc orders arrive except for first class USPS.
UPS, Fed EX, OnTrac, Priority mail never ever got lost. Not even once.</review>

They keep returning our incoming mail to whoever is sending it! DMV paperwork, our driver's licenses, gifts for our daughter, wedding invitations. Who knows what other bills we have missed out on because they keep shoving VACANT slips in our mailbox! WE LIVE AT OUR ADDRESS. STOP DECLINING OUR MAIL. This is costing us money!!!!</text>

This post office is the worst post office I have ever dealt with. They are horrendously unorganized and do not communicate well with each other at all. It has been three different occasions within three months that mail has not gotten delivered to me and that they have left me a slip to pick up at the post office, each time my things supposedly not being there. Yet I come the next weekend and they are miraculously there. On top of that, there is always a long line and wait time when I go there, so why do they open so late? I always have to wait until the weekend to get things straightened out because of this. And not only that, they seem to never answer the phone nor do they have an answering service. The two people I have dealt with each time I've gone there, one woman and one man, have been extremely rude when I've tried explaining my situation and asking if my items are there. Just absolutely awful service overall. I wish I had a different option as far as what post office delivered my mail.<//Text>

The people who manage mail delivery at this location are incompetent. I have never had so many problems from a post office. We have gone in there several times to complain to the manager only to have the same issue over and over again. I wish we could have our mail handled by the Citrus Heights office instead. Our post man should have been fired years ago.<//Review>

Worst post office ever!!!!!! they hire nothing but morans.!!... The postmen can not even read a simple address. I have lived here in Carmichael for 12 years and they have yet to get it right.......Marconi ave is not even close to looking like Robertson ave . I think these guys must be on drugs or something..... , they are forever delivering my stuff to Robertson, and vise versa , .....I get this poor guys (a veteran) medication all the time, and I have to deliver it to him, because these morans cant read.How can someone get Marconi ave and Robertson ave confused?  Um Yeah they don't even look like the same address.......for this reason and this reason only I wish I did not live in Carmichael....The Carmichael post office is embarrassing. This manager is well lets just say not the brightest crayon in the box....I am ashamed to say I live in Carmichael .........</Review>

<text>I've lived in Carmichael for over 30 years and have nothing bad to say regarding the Carmichael post office, I've had a box with them ever since they were on Palm and have always found them to be professional and courteous.

I will say that I do feel bad for the garbage they have to deal with from some of the more obnoxious patrons . I run a home based business and as such am in the post office 3 or 4 times a week it's about a 2.5 mile walk from my house and I walk there almost every morning. At one time Carmichael was a nice place to live, it was the type of community where on your walk to the post office people would take the time to say good morning to each other.

Well that all changed after the rents skyrocketed, The more conservative Carmichael became the more obnoxious and rude people became, Seems like the conservative better than thou crowd has moved in and they simply have no time to be pleasant or courteous.

It seems like every time I'm in the post office there's some inconsiderate buffoon in there making a fuss out of nothing usually the same person who's on the phone babbling about the Kenyan in office ,

More often than not it's some woman glued to her phone and then when it's her turn at the counter she has the audacity to get mad at the poor guy behind the counter because he cant figure if she's talking to him or the person on the other end of her phone..

It would be hilarious if it didn't slow the line down so much.. There is an old Bible quote regarding treating others as you wish to be treated and I'm thinking that many of the people posting bad reviews calling people morons should take a long cold hard look in the mirror, Chances are more likely than not it's you're own inconsiderate, obnoxious attitude that is responsible for your bad experiences in life..< /text>< Rating>

Keep getting other people's mail in my box.  Had a parcel due last week, tracking said "delivered" but I didn't receive it.  Phone at PO is always busy or they don't answer.   Filed a complaint, but no call back.  In the meantime I'm out $200.  Hire people who can actually read!!< /Review>

Postal worker on the 2700 block of Marconi Ave had been tampering with mail and packages. Have caught her three times giving the wrong package to someone. Beware! She is older and has shoulder length blond hair. Move if you can.< /text>

<Text>My dog Ollie cut open his foot  on a broken mirror.
Poor guy.
He needed stitches.
Dr. Nolasco and staff took great care of him.
They were very kind and efficient.
Also, they are open 7 days a week which is very convenient for us working pet parents.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv1d1ACl4hCcvXS6RkUemFfFrKL0fBecUhjTVe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I've been there twice last week my experience with veterinarian is 5 starts really good, they have  work a little bit more to treat customers in front desk, they are really quiet ,a good morning and have a good day make a lot of difference, at least.</Review>

I've gone for two pet emergencies here, and I have been so happy with the staff and my experience as a pet owner. I felt really informed and was provided with estimates before any further actions were taken with my pets. Will continue to seek the guidance of this team with my pets!</text>

While the wait time may seem a bit long even when the office was empty, the doctor’s knowledge, care and bedside manner were stellar. Had to bring my mom’s dog in for an emergency visit when there was blood in the urine and the doctor and staff were great, responsive, and incredibly informative.<//Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>When my family and I leave for vacations (averaging 4 days or so), we have my dog board here.

Upon seeing the place in which my dog would stay, I was so sad to see that the conditions were/are very poor. The hospital's website states: "On occasion when we go out of town we need a place for our furry family member to stay while we are gone. Your pet can stay in a temperature controlled environment where he/she will be loved and cared for by our staff. He/she will stay in a spacious dog run with views of his/her neighbors and talk to the others about their great family and how much they are loved."

This is all complete bullshit. They sleep in caged, wired boxes(essentially) on a cold, hard cement floor. I hope that they at least provide them with a blanket considering they are sleeping on bare cement and during the winter time. The dogs in there are miserable; though it is true the dogs will view their "neighbors", it is because they have so little space. I do not buy any of their tempered, cutesy rhetoric. The staff are both nice and lifeless, basically.

I cannot speak for their medical services because my pet has only received shots from this place, no surgery or urgent medical treatment.

Tl;dr - if you love your pet, please do not board them here. You get what you pay for<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The doctors at Valley Animal Hospital has cared for all my 4 doggies,  They have the knowledge and experience to give an accurate and understandable diagnosis. I strayed and took one of my dogs to another vet a couple of weeks ago and they wanted to do a bunch of tests and really charged a lot-  the Doctors give real options and try to keep costs down-   Another thing that totally impressed me is that I was supposed to call the next morning for my dogs blood test results BUT instead I got the follow up call from his staff and really felt that they cared and listened to my updates on how she was doing! Their hours are great and prices are very very reasonable.<//Review>

And even though the vet admitted that their machines we're old as the reason why the image was not captured, I was still charged $250. Not to mention they suggested several other tests be ran on my cat that would have been even more expensive and very painful for her. Dr. Renia in Hollywood Worked out to be the best veterinarian I have ever been to. We were able to find out what was wrong with my cat she has mild asthma.</review>< Pictures>

Anyway, they took him from me to a back room, said I couldn't come in. I thought they were trying to save him. They had just left him in that room all alone. When I demanded to see him they would not let me until I paid them almost 300 dollars. I was freaking, pleading that I just wanted to hold him while he was still warm. No way, had to pay. I remember thinking, "Thank God the office is totally empty, they can concentrate totally on saving my Rungkin" To say the least, that's not what they were thinking. I'm sure if there had been witnesses they wouldn't have ripped me off so easily. Coldest thing I've ever experienced from a human.<//Review>< Pictures>

I was very dissatisfied with the service I received from this establishment. I took my dog in for 5 day kennel service and grooming. During my pets stay she got a wound on her paw, which wasn't observed until she was picked up. Not to mention, this occurred 2 yrs prior. I called the hospital and made them aware of the wound that occurred while my pet was in their kennel. They had the nerve to charge me $180.00 for their failure of not properly taking care of my pet.  I have taken all my pets to this hospital for over 20 yrs and I have never had to experience this bad quality of service. I am unhappy with the proper care for my dog or assistance to the charges that I was billed additionally for their error.               Linda- unsatisfied customer< /review>

Dropped off my long hair cat so he could have a bath.  A friend brought him there and back as I just got out of the hospital.  When I took him out of the carrier, one entire side of his fur was one giant mat. They were closing so I couldn’t call to have this fixed. I ended up having that side of his body shaved to the skin in order to get that huge mat removed.  If they could mess up a bath, I certainly wouldn’t trust them to care for a wound or illness. TAKE YOUR PETS SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU LOVE THEM!!!<//Review>

Beware, they killed my dog and only care to drain your pocket. If your pet is important to you, Make yourself a favor and don't go there. I was dumb and fool not to read their review and now my dog is gone. A simple care ended up all night bleeding. I'm so sad that I went there. How the hell this place is still operating? The gov has the answer. I already submitted a claim to the California board and hopefully they will shots down this so called hospital.</Text>

<review>I brought my 2yr old Frenchie here for the first time today after growing tired of his previous vets SUPER long waits and rude staff. I give Valley Animal Hospital 5 stars for many reasons; 1) they gave me a same day appointment at a time in need. 2) there office visits are only $48.00  3) the place is VERY clean. 4) The staff and doctor were very straight forward and polite. 5) my dog always growled and got anxious at his old vet and did not act like that here, he was much more calm and relaxed. 6) the doctor did not try and rip me off by ordering any "extra/costly" blood or skin tests. 7) the meds my dog needed were in stock and readily available. 8) the establishment is with in 5 miles of my home.<//review><username>Jamie Lewis</username><user>108869118725598645019< /user><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Is not every day that I write a review but there are times when I have to let other know what places/services they need to *avoid*

This -hospital- place is a clown short of a circus.  They can care less about what my dog needed.  After 2 minutes talking to the "vet" I got a bad vibe (he seemed more interested in his phone than on what I was trying to explain what was going on with my dog) and excused myself and left the place not without first paying over couple of hundred for tests that were not needed.

This place is a mere two block away from my house but I will not go inside again ever.  I rather take the extra time and effort to take my dogs to a palace I know has their best interest in hand.

My visit was at the beginning of this year.</Review>

<Text>HORRIBLE! brought a feral kitten (tiny) in and they advised it would die b/c of the fleas, so we listened and went along with the flea solution they told us to put on her - it killed her by the next morning!  NEXT we captured the mother cat to have her spade and THEY WOULDN'T EVEN DISCOUNT the price - a big sign they DO NOT CARE about animals - they are an EMBARRASSMENT to Vets everywhere - READ THE OTHER REVIEWS, so many bad ones, they should be closed!<//Text>< username>

The only thing good about this place is Richard at the front desk.  Dr. Perry is very condescending and cold.  They don't provide overnight care so if your dog needs surgery NEVER take them here.  You will have to transfer to an emergency hospital that is only open from 6pm  to 8 am and then you have to pick your pet back up and transfer them again.  Ridiculous!  Also, Dr. Perry was not at all good with my little chihuahua.  NO BEDSIDE MANNER.  I will not be back!</Text>

I have been going to this vet for several years, and in the past I can say that I have received caring service for my pets. In more recent times, I can say that the doctors have been good with my pets...the front office staff and some of the technicians however, are completely heartless and inept individuals. It is not alright to treat people like they are idiots...I understand that dealing with stressed out people is not fun...but that is the downside of working in this field. The word care is in the title of your job...do it...</text>

I have used this hospital for about 15 years and I am happy with their service and professionalism.  About a couple of years ago they hired a new manager for the office and I believe this is where some of the trouble resides in the complaints.  They horribly underpay the staff and as a result they seem to go through many people for the front office.  Other than that it is an excellent facility.</Text>

This place took my money and ruined my dogs teeth. They removed the wrong tooth that had an abses, and because of that it never went away! When I went back to them they denied that there was anything wrong ( my dog is white and fluffy and he clearly​ had a black scab on his face) The x-rays that they took before surgery, were somehow non existent now. It was all mess. And I was not going to pay for anything else. I went to another hospital instead. My dog is now healthy, with a few missing teeth but at least he's alive.< /text>

This place is horrible, I brought my dog in for an exam, The vet performed a rectal exam which caused my dog to stop walking properly in his back legs wasn't able to go to the restroom anymore and cried nonstop. I'm telling you the reader, before I took my dog in, my dog could walk properly and use the restroom fine their was nothing wrong with him except he was constipated. I went back to demand they treat what they caused to my dog on May 29, 2016 The owner said he would only treat him if I payed. I said no why would I pay for something you caused, and I got into a huge argument with the owner of the place. Well the owner didn't care. I'm writing this because my dog had a seizure it had trouble breathing and it passed away on May 30, 2016. If you love your pets take them somewhere else where they do care about your pet and its customers because this place does not. I plan on suing this place for malpractice I've already contacted an attorney because my dog deserved more than this.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Rate>1</Rate></record>

<text>I brought my cat when  he was limping for some injury that was not evident to me. He wouldn't  let me touch him, when I brought him here he was handled with such ease he never complained. The dr. gave me specific instructions  and meds to help him recover, and he did fully.
I also have two dogs and one had to be seen because of an allergic reaction. Not only Dr. Ashkan addressed her symptoms but alerted me on a possible thyroid problem and suggested  a course of action for this and some dental problems.
Girls in the front office are very professional, nice and bilingual.
The costs of services is very fair and affordable.< /text>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Love this place. By far the most honest vet ive been to. They saw my dog in a timely manner even though it had to be by appointment. Which was made for only an hour after i arrived. What i most appreciated was that my dog was evaluated before any yalk of money was made. I was given options towards what i would like to do with my dog. Only the services i requested dor where done with no extras. This is my second visit here to the valley animal hospital. The first was more then pleasant as well as my second. For sure if any other medical needs should be neededin the future this is definitely first to come to mind and would gladly and strongly recomend this place to all pet owners.
Thank you for ur awesome services. 😀</Text>< Pics>

Avoid. Rude unprofessional staff. Very condescending to customers. When calling to check on our cat they sounded like we were annoying them. At the end of it all tried to charge us 1,600 for unnecessary procedures which were never discussed prior to them supposedly performing them.< /text>

it is horrible how they treated me and how they sent my dog to the creamatorium.They didnt tell me that he died before sending him away. I suspect of course that they did something wrong to my dog and to cover it up after he died or
because they made a mistake and would not own  up to it.  I brought my beautiful aaakita in for boarding for some x rays and a blood test.  the next day I go to pick him up and they say he is dead.  They   tried to call but couldnt find the right number THAT WAS A LIE   I reached down to show George the manager  and  on the form I filled out the day before  there was my correct phone number. I would suggest not to take your pet there unless you would like to put them down!!!
Linda   she is in on whatever is going there but she would not answer any questions...</review>

<review>DISHONEST:  They are dishonest about the actual total cost of services until AFTER they have given the services and you are forced to pay for it.  They were not upfront about the actual cost of services!  After my cat was seen by the doctor, another man named Omar, a nurse I think, came in and quoted me a price for the services that the doctor recommended.  I specifically asked him "what is the total out the door price that I am looking at for this list of services", and he said "$220 for the whole thing."  Based on this total price he told me, I said okay go ahead.  When I went outside to pay a deposit, the receptionist told me the total charges were $306 for the exact same list of services.  After a few moments of disagreement on the price, I reluctantly agreed to $306 since my cat was in pain and needed to be cared for.
The next day, a man who sounded like Omar, called me and told me that my pet needed additional services.  Again I asked him twice "what will be the TOTAL additional charges for all these additional services," and he said "a total of $70 more."  I said "okay, go ahead, but not for more than $70."  When I went to pick up my cat later that day, the front receptionist actually charged me $158 in additional fees.  The total cost that was quoted to me for these services for the two days was $290, but they actually charged me $464 for the exact same list of services.  Nothing additional was done to even begin to justify the higher fee.
This technique that they used of quoting me a lower price before the services were rendered, and the inflated price they actually charged for the same exact list of services when I went to pay is very deceptive and dishonest!  They were not honest about their pricing upfront even when I specifically ask them what the total cost is or will be.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Such a rip off. Don't attend to go to this hospital. Save your money and go somewhere else. Richard is straight up rude and half ass at his job. They don't care about the well being of the animals and only in it for the money.<//Text>

Showed up at 555p since it's posted they close at 7p. Walked right in and the receptionist very rudely said they were closed, said nobody was around to help. Also scoffed and said they "haven't been open until 7p in two years." No compassion.</review>

<Text>The coffee bean is a great place. I love their teas specially matcha tea. I love that they have a pretty design. I also like they are covid complaint. They do not have a lot of hot coffees, but they do have a lot of iced. Everything has a lot of flavor, some may be too sweet but depends on taste.< /Text><user_name>Ariadne Garcia</user_name><userid>101451737088939763019<//userid><Response>None<//Response>< Rating>

The jail next door releases in the morning so there are usually miscreants sleeping in the plaza. Just a heads-up.< /Text>< Pictures>

This location charged me extra because I said no ice in my already cold drink (cold brew), and the very KARENish manager argued that I “would be receiving MORE product.” They advertise drinks based on the amount of ounces … BUT do not expect to give you the amount of ounces you’re actually paying for.

<Review>Quick pro tip: WiFi here Is super spotty. The wifi takes extra long to get going. I don't know what it is but I have been to a few coffee beans and the WiFi is always super spotty?
Other than that I really enjoyed my stop here at the rancho Cucamonga coffee bean. Nestled in a sweet little corner of the main Street. Definitely gets busy, but there is plenty of space to sit outside and enjoy the shade and ambiance that this place is lucky to have. The location is just so perfect. The outside seating makes you really want to sit outside.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcx0wMYw-J83dp9M2fev-rjpuTk01B6081TC0L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQR1SqdtfA_utMMpm2mtD_JSeLCu0iYucdr4Ce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpjYzjd8v63Y0OxI6mufN8YTUThlnPwm47RtYY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCljoYVQfs1ahKFW2x7xXVgLOQBBssLQZjmSaU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqGQYY3tXNl39DsRKzwd4_LfahTYimxY-byJtM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4oJnS3pg8Wuid5W2mCK84__hrG_fbtxhifo8z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3KVvyz9rVE2TIDnG1cUaHb0ysIuvtYx7D1j51=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY2_s0qMzu1Pd6NmV_6CB_-JrCej8Oy3_sUxWq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZnb8MxYFUDaWmGhlKAqf2pw4KxbxClfRz866Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlk52DPV3NCTa08JQlTbVWDoknD0BEnJW3MulJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5AsvZVxi5UnTvmnTjlPcq2gpAm1fbgLKyZD4b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c335def09ce80d:0xadde18c96f5dbb0</GmapID></record>

Every time I go which is all because I go to study for school and I'm a full time student (just as a idea of how much time I spend there) they are always 100% friendly and I have never had them make a mistake on my order nor have had any issues with anyone there. It is a great place to go to concentrate. And they have great products.

Guess you can only write one review but this is edit to add.

Once again they have the best staff and are still great I love it here. I stopped being able to come for a few weeks and I come back and remember why I missed it. Just as good as Starbucks yet cheaper. Keep up the GREAT work guys!💕👍<//Review>

<Text>I was so disappointed when I received my order. I was tired at work and needed some coffee. What I got tastes like heavy cream with a splash of coffee. Does this look like it has an add shot? -_-  it was very sweet and tasted weird. The hazelnut flavor was gross.</Text>< Pics>

The employees were friendly and the service was fast. I gave it 4 stars as the tables and chairs were dirty, meaning the staff had not wiped them down.

At 11 am there were only 4 customers in the place, so I feel that it should have been cleaner.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I'm so happy they are on my long ride home from Riverside WMSCOG to W. L. A. Right now they have the hot pumpkin spice chai tea latte with whip cream, that is so delicious! I called from my car to make sure they were still open and they answered the phone! That is rare.  It was free because of my reward so I was doubly happy. The man was very nice & made it perfectly.</Text>

This exact location is one of the best around this area. The outdoor seating is fantastic. They serve a great flat white and nitro cold brew coffee. Make sure to try the lemon loaf also it's great. It has wifi and a big table inside that can accommodate groups. If you need to charge your laptop they have a plug outlet for that as well.</Review>

<review>The SHIFT SUPERVISOR Steve is an absolute moron. He charged my friend “extra” because he didn’t get ice in his COLD brew coffee (it’s already...COLD). My friend wouldn’t be getting any “extra” coffee in the 24oz capacity cup he paid for. Since the cup can only hold 24oz.  This is absolutely unethical.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>This is more of a coffee stop than a coffee shop. But it's my favorite that I've found here in CA so far. I drink an Americano and theirs looks and tastes fantastic.  My americano here is consistently creamy, fruity and rich. It's a bit out of my way to get to their semi-hidden Mint street location but worth it.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Service and beverage were great but the tables were obviously in need of cleaning. Instead of wiping down the tables and restocking the little condiment area, the employees stood around talking to each other when the customer flow let up. (At least a good 10 to 15 minute "break " )<//Review>

Gave me coffee with regular milk instead of soy, I’m lactose intolerant so it matters. It was too hot to taste in the moment so I didn’t notice until I was 15 minuets away. I spent $5 on a drink that’ll make me sick, great.</review>

I was kinda short on cash so I just had the iced coffee. What a jolt, really woke me up. It tasted very strong, I had it black and the best part was it was only $3 and no calories. I also wanted an H2O and I asked about the Eternal Water that the sell, only  $2, but the Aizelle one of the staff who is a sweetheart offered me a filtered water from the back for free.</review>

Came here to study but there was no wifi. When I told the employee that the wi-fi was not working they just stated that they couldn't do anything about it and were not willing to reset their router. So, if you're here to do any study online, I guess you should know that there is a chance that the internet won't work.
3 stars because besides this inconvenience, at least their tea selection is good. So, just bring a book to read instead.</text>

They don't brew fresh organic coffee at this location. The Rialto location always has organic Mexico brew available and I would have thought since this one is in Rancho they would have it available. I don't want bummy pesticide filled coffee. Fruits and veggies can be washed off with vinegar to remove pesticides but coffee and tea should always be organic.</Text>

<Review>I’ve been to this location and others in the past, it wasn’t till recently that I had a the best experience. I was warmly greeted by a delightful employee. Victoria assisted in accommodating my needs in my search for the perfect Christmas gift for myself. She has such a exquisite taste in jewelry. If you need help picking anything out for a loved one, I highly recommend asking for Victoria. Not only did she provide excellent customer service, she also worked the numbers to get me a great price and low payments. I definitely will be returning. Remember the name VICTORIA.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2d7d68c13cf71:0x7df52cfcafa6130e< /GmapID>< name>

I was very pleased with my experience at Don Roberto. Jorge was so helpful throughout my visit, and was able to get me a great deal on a couple watches . I was very happy with my visit to the store, the quality of service and product. Jorge was so knowledgeable, friendly and even though he was the store manager still made time to take care of the customer. I highly recommend Don Roberto, as they won’t disappoint! Ask for Jorge highly recommended. 👌👍</text>

I always have a great experience coming into Don Roberto Jewelers at the West Covina Mall Plaza. Jorge the store manager is always super friendly, has great customer service skills and he's helpful. The staff behind him also are very friendly and helpful. I started coming to this location in August 2020 with my boyfriend & I will continue to be coming back with him. If you are searching for a sign, Don Roberto Jewelers is the one for you.</Review>

I love this location, right next to Macy's. I drive 45 mins just to come to this location. I've recently been helped by Victoria, she's super helpful and has great taste in jewelry. She helped me pick out a gift for my mother. If you go to this location ask for Victoria, if she's off don't let that stop you. Ask for Jorge, but ask for Victoria first.< /text>

<review>Victoria has recently reached out to me the last few months, for promotions and making sure I pay on time. Every time I call she's always the one to answer in a polite manner. She's the type of person we need in times like these. She brings hope for all those who have lost all hope. What's in your wallets? I'll tell you whats in mine, a DRJ  card with good credit thanks to Victoria. I don't live life without it. Go see Victoria, because you're worth it. Rewards reimagine, it's easy as snap! crackle! pop! I will definitely be asking Victoria to help me next time I go to make my next purchase. Save money live better. You're in good hands with Victoria, she's always HELPING OTHERS GET WHAT THEY WANT. America runs on DonRobertosJewelers.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<username>Jr Leyva< /username><Time>1611454164232< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I started coming here last year during the summer. The staff here prioritize the safety of each costumer due to COVID they maintain a 6ft apart policy and clean every counter with disinfectant supplies. I feel safe , welcomed and at home when I come to the West Covina Mall Center location . Jorge, the store manager is great and helpful in so many ways, I trust him with all my jewelry cleaning and I trust his knowledge about the inventory inside the whole store. I live in Hawaiian Gardens, Ca and I take the extra 25 min drive to this location specifically for they’re customer service and Jorge the store manager. This extra drive says a lot about me coming here more often than any other location I’ve been to. I highly recommend this location inside the West Covina Mall. It is never a disappointment 10/10 overall experience.<//Review>< pictures>

My experience with Don Roberto Jewelers was absolutely wonderful. Linetth was amazing! She helped me find the perfect jewelry and didn't pressure me into anything! And explained everything very clearly and I left a happy camper! I highly recommend stopping by this place if you are in the market for a diamond.<//Text>

<review>DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT shop here or any don Robertos. They are an absolute rip off I was told I was buying 18k white gold items that added up to 1500+ and then I found out that while PACKAGING up my jewelry that they swapped out my jewelry with 10k gold PLATED. And of course I didn't realize it til my mother told me that hear earing were turning her ears green. So I had to embarrassingly round up all the gifts I had bought for the women in my life. And then took them all to an appraiser only to find out that their COMBINED worth was AT MOST 350 dollars. So then I took them back to the store only to be told that they would not take them back and untold them I wasn't going to pay for fake jewelry. Then they took me to court ...pisses me off just having to relive this by typing out my experience. I think you understand my point. And AGAIN DO NOT SHOP THERE<//review>< name>

My visit to Don Roberto Jewelers, West Covina exceeded my expectations.  My rep, Lineth was very friendly, patient, and polite.  She answered all my questions without any pressure.  I will definitely come back to this branch for the quality products and the professional and friendly staff.</text>

Came in wanted to talk about the credit options regarding my account and talked to someone who had no idea how credit works.   She said, " she is not a credit person". How do you work at Don Roberto's and not know about credit?  Puzzles me.  Sweet lady but not knowledgeable.</text>

(Translated by Google) The truth is a bad experience ... the manager is very incompetent ... he is not responsible to speak to the clergy in any problem and the worst k long before the payments are due to start calling .... very rude .. So ... I will never recommend it ... very bad service ...

The Desert Rain Spa was in the vicinity of this fascinating installation of Desert X, one of several imaginative and very creative projects that were installed through the Coachella Valley and other more remote areas of the desert.  The next Desert X will occur in 2021.  I was able to view and experience nine of the installations.   Some of them actually caused me to think outside the box.</text>

We spent one night in this motel. The beds were different heights and sizes, one of them had some hair on the sheets.
Four of the hot tubs were gutted with construction cones all around. Very "rustic" overall, kind of reminds me of a place where you stay when you have no other options. Not the stunning place of all the reviews, maybe they take down bad press? It was worth a $50 fee, but not $109.< /text>

<text>This is by far the best little secret in Desert Hot Springs California..
I love everything about this spa hotel,the owner of the Desert Rain gave me his personal cell phone number..
Whenever I need a break from life all I gotta do is call or text him an let him know I’m gonna be needing a room an I will Be give the red carpet...
I just wished that they would have the pools and spas open all night like the Desert Hot Springs spa hotel does...
Maybe I possibly gave um the idea...
now they might need to at least try it out...<//text></record></dataset><record>

Rudest place ever. Had to go to hospital because it had a lot of heavy thick mold. Day we moved to Miracle Springs, the owner tried to force himself into the room when my husband was gone trying to get us a last minute booking. Horrible people. I recommend DHS SPA, Miracle and even the Hundai just up palm.< /Review>

Fourth of  July  weekend we arrived  and were extremely  disappointed  to find four empty  hot tubs. we explained  our dissapointed  to  the front  desk  guy. If the hotel  was  under  construction  it should  have  been  stated on their  site. he felt  that one hot tub and pool was  satisfactory. We ended  up  paying  to use  a different  resort. 4</text>

No customer service at all I'm disabled and they locked the front door so I had to go all the way around just enter and no warm water in the shower room next to the pools and one of the workers is really weird he was peeing outside on the steps and my room had a couple roaches. The doors even say open from 7am to 11pm and they have them locked all day. And no wheelchair accessible bathrooms in the rooms.<//Review>

Very clean, Staff was friendly, Price was great, 5 hot tubs and a pool with a deep end that is heated year round, bathtub in the room was deep and clean, bead was flat and not lumpy.  It was a fantastic value for the money.  If you have Children be mindful someone who can swim will need to be watching them continually on account of the deep end there is  NO Lifeguard.  I loved my experience here I plan to come back.<//review>

oh no...dont even go for the price...pillows and blankets had stains, Spas (4 of them) have been closed for at least 8 months (under construction...the place looks like it was built in the 50s with some upgrades to make more modern looking, but too little to late.</text>

One of the strangest places I've ever stayed. Rooms were cleanish, but lacked some basics like a night stand on both sides of the bed. The mattress was as basic as they come, but no bedbugs, which is a plus. Great pool and jacuzzi although they were resurfacing half of the spa area when we were there. Staff were not very helpful. We arrived at 2pm and were told we would need to wait until 3 to check in. Small TV in the room, stained carpet, poor location. Price point was good at $75 a night.< /Text>

The staff were very nice, accommodating. The room itself was fine, but the bed was very hard and difficult to get good sleep.
The pool area was nice and they are currently building four smaller hot tubs which will be nice once finished.</Text>

I give these 3 stars for now cause,  I will be arriving there soon. I have seen many reviews. So far I've only seen one negative review out just the few i had read. Sounds like a great place to stay. I did call once to confirm my reservations. The staff member sound very friendly and answered my questions. Until I get there i will found out for myself. Price is definitely my range.💞 Though I do have a question? Is there any real close by food joints or restaurants? And also is there like any parks close by too?
Just wondering. 🤗

I will definitely come back again. I am here 3 nights. THE front counter service was great very polite, the prices are awesome, Rooms are great nice clean bathroom toilets and tub/showers . They do have Jacuzzis but they are working on them. The view and sights are enjoyable.</review>

<Review>Very nice place to stay. Clean rooms. Lots of privacy. Excellent staff, very nice. Price can't be beat in the entire desert area. Amenities are great. Room we had came with a full size kitchenette.. We stayed for an extended stay and we never were bothered by any noise or  staff unless we requested their assistance. Monir, the manager, went above and  beyond to make sure our stay there was comfortable. Desert Rain must be doing it all righ because they are always sold out of rooms before the weekend. So reserve earlier and in advance. You will be pleasantly surprised at this  gem of the desert.<//Review><Time>1543596078503<//Time><Response>None</Response><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

<Text>Located 15 minutes from downtown Palm Springs. Quiet and clean neighborhood. Workers were nice for the most part, but when I asked for extra towels and shampoo, they were a bit reluctant to give me any. They had 4 hottubs in the middle with music playing all night which is nice but the music could get annoying. Nice indoor jacuzzi and saunas to hangout in. Clean large, heated pool to swim and have fun in. Technically, they have a gym but it is a joke of a gym with nothing to really get a workout in. All amentities close at 11pm. There was daily house keeping. Room was clean and comfortable. WiFi was pretty slow. Overall, great price for what it is!</Text>< user_name>

<Review>WARNING! FRAUDULENT CHARGES!!!!!!  I have been charged by this hotel and have never even known what this place is and have never even been to California. I discovered a fraudulent charge and called hotel management. The hotel did nothing to help me and the matter is currently being investigated. Don't stay where criminals have access to your card info. It's bad enough that I never stayed there and they still obtained it.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<review>We were informed that the rooms have plumbing issues right before we reached the hotel and we were suggested to find a new hotel by the receptionist. But as we told them that we had 3 bookings, they told us that the plumbing issues were all fixed. That's just now how you deal with a customer.</review><time>1520785384399</time><Rating>1< /Rating></record>

Room with kitchen is out of quit but not equipped was a microwave unless requested. At time of check-in, multiple customers had booked rooms with kitchens or kitchenettes without any available at check-in so I would recommend someone double check their reservation once established</Review>

All the pools have closed signs on them due to no permits “we have to have those up but you can still swim” - so if anything happens in your faulty pools, we'll be responsible? No thank you.” We went as an entire family with 5 kids (nieces and nephew too)- with the soul purpose to swim over the holiday. Also the owner was rude, we stopped by when we got into town and were told we could check in at 1, we show back up at 1 and the same guy tells us not until 3.  Day pool use is $20 per person per hour (for pools that aren’t even ‘open’). We checked in, looked around and noped out. It’ll be worth it when they have the pools up and legally running but to not let any clients know while booking was pretty crappy. Now they won’t even acknowledge our calls to get it sorted out.

Edit - front desk guy was fantastic and accomadating. We are will to give this place another try once everything is up and properly permitted.

Edit # 2 - says there’s BBQs that you can use - it’s one (1) small round Webber grill with a bunch of Park benches that are lifting and splitting. FYI just Incase you were thinking that might be redeeming.<//text>

<Text>Horrendous experience! Stay away!  I wish I could leave less than one star.

My wife and I booked to stay here through Priceline. First off, they had us scheduled for the wrong weekend. I received a call at 6pm on a Friday three weeks before we were going to be in California asking why we hadn't checked in yet. After calling them I spoke with their OWNER, and it was by far the worst customer experience I had ever received. The OWNER was YELLING at me, the customer, accusing me of having my dates wrong, however all of my confirmations through Priceline were for the correct date. The owner refused to acknowledge that his system was at fault.

I call up Priceline, double check with them, and they had the correct dates, and they contacted the owner of the hotel to fix my dates. After not hearing back for a couple days, I cancel my order (which I still had 2.5 weeks before I should even be charged for any stay).

Fast forward a few days past our actual stay in California, we notice a charge from Desert Rain Spa Hotel for our stay that:
1. We canceled.
2. We never even set foot on their premise.
3. They had the wrong dates for our stay.
4. They didn't even have authority to charge us (canceled within the $0 booking time frame).
5. The amount they charged was a few dollars MORE than the amount on my CANCELED Priceline receipt of what we would have paid.

After contacting Priceline again and spending over an hour with them on the phone (They were INCREDIBLY helpful, I highly recommend them! The reason it was so long was because the owner of the hotel kept putting the Priceline agent on hold for minutes at a time.) Finally, I get confirmation from Priceline saying the owner has acknowledge a refund and will submit it. Normally it should take 14-15 business days to process. Sweet.

Now, sitting here 18 business days post that confirmation email - still no refund from Desert Rain Spa Hotel. So now I have to deal with the rude, inconsiderate owner of the hotel again, and contact Priceline again.

I RARELY write reviews, but this frustration warranted enough to inform others - Stay away!</Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) If a little construction site, great hotel. The pool with the water from the hot springs was awesome.

(Translated by Google) Perfect overnight stay for a single night. Affordable, free parking, close to the motorway, gas station and a big plus to start the day taking a dip in the pool.

(Original)
Perfekt övernattningsställe för en enstaka natt. Prisvärt, gratis parkering, nära till motorvägen, bensinstation och ett stort plus att börja dagen med att ta ett dopp i poolen.</review>

(Translated by Google) The thermal pools have very good thermal quality and water temperature. The place needs a lot of maintenance. It is very deteriorated and neglected. The room we touched recently remodeled and with everything new and nice. The window of the washroom and dressing room has a curtain that lets light in and it is very annoying because it gives directly to the bed. It does not let you sleep.

(Original)
Las albercas termales tienen muy buena calidad termal y temperatura del agua. El lugar necesita bastante mantenimiento. Esta muy deteriorado y descuidado. La habitación nos toco recien remodelada y con todo nuevo y agradable. La ventana del area de labavo y vestidor tiene una cortina que deja pasar la luz y es muy molesto porque da directamente sobe la cama. No te deja dormir.</review>

<review>I’ve been to several other shops here in town but this place makes me feel like family, the kind of family you’re happy to see when they walk in. Their prices are very competitive and they take the time to help you find what you’re looking for, no rushing. Big shout out to Mohammad! He seems like he’s always there and it’s always willing to help.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ You saw correctly, six stars.< /review>< time>

One of my favorite smoke shops!! It  may not be a big place.  but they make up for it with their service. and good prices I always end up paying less then what the sticker price is on any water pipe /bong  when I’m there ..  and they always have a good assortment of glass that always gives me a hard time trying to choose what to pick< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>For me to rate a store 5 stars depends on a couple of things. Excellent customer service is number one which is exactly what The Matrix delivers every time I go in there. All the workers there are extremely helpful and nice. I am a repeat customer there and they actually remember me which is a huge kudos point in my book. They are also very knowledgeable of all their products. Every time I walk out of that store I feel confident in the product I just purchased. The second thing I look for is the variety of products a store offers. As soon as you walk into The Matrix you can see the vast amount of products they sell. I love going in there and checking out all the new items. The last and final thing I look for is the cleanliness of a store which is a never a problem here. Everything is kept clean and nice ready for customers to walk in. This has to be the best smoke shop in the area hands down. I love this store!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The Matrix smoke shop is my husband and my favorite shop in the entire area! The pieces they sell are beautiful, fantastic quality, and inexpensive. We have checked out with each employee and they have amazing customer service, very polite, professional, and educated. Any time I make a purchase they almost always have deals for a variety of products going on, and give me additional deals any time I make a purchase! I highly recommend purchasing regularly from them, they’re absolutely amazing! They have an awesome instagram page as well that I recommend following, they post there with information about  their deals. Almost every piece I have are from them and I love every one of them!< /Text>

GREEDY!!!!  $35 for a pack of Juuls you can get at shell for $25.  If it was a couple dollars whatever but $10 is GREED....  If money isn't a thing to you go ahead but too expensive for me.  They act like they're selling something you can get at any gas station LOL!<//Review>

<text>...lots and lots of smoke shops...but how many open till 11PM? Not many. And even fewer....the number of shops open till 11PM...who get a call at 5 minutes till....asking if they'll wait for you... you're running late...and they stay till 11:30PM!!??? GOTTA BE ONLY ONE. These guys showed appreciation for my consistent business....even though my average purchase is probably only $7  They've earned my loyalty back ..for sure.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80db7f58671f0c29:0x3803c3c720b3d0ff</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Went in for a coil on my tank. The guy behind the counter changed it for me and stripped my threads on my mod... told them about it AS it happened and they refused to do anything about it. To top it off, the coil they installed faulted on my other mod... bottom line: hacks and crooks.<//review>< Rate>

Came in for Fumari Hookah tobacco, kid who looked to be about 14 or 15 quoted me $7.99 for the 100 gram pouch. Got to the register and he said 10 dollars even. I said that's incorrect you said $7.99. He said I asked and the price was 10 dollars. I said bye kid. It wasn't about the price  It was the shady customer service that pisses me off.< /Text>

<Review>Fhis place is very friendly and defenetly shows love for loyal customers. always have had good expeiriences here since they opened and they have shown me a lot of love for my loyalty. its always nice when shop owners recognize your buisness and try to kick you deals and special prices for spending your money with them.</Review>< Rating>

I walked in this place looking for vape devices it was outrageous price almost double of other vape shopes. I was talking to a guy working there he was blunt not willing to talk about devices l was interested in. When a person walked in he left me and never said a word, l just walked out, what a shady place, they  are ignorant about customer service and very rude. Don't go to this place for vape, there are other vape places in town with good customer service and good price!!<//Text>

I don't understand how other people can say that they have good prices in a good selection they do have a ton of glass but their prices are completely outrageous I can buy the same pieces in Fallbrook or at Vishions in Temecula for almost half the price of some of the stuff they have.</text>

<text>This places prices are RIDICULOUSLY expensive!!! I used to buy filters there and checked a couple other places and a lot of their products are cheaper elsewhere. And to top it off they basically scammed me out of $60. BEWARE people before you decide to buy from here, check other smoke shops first.<//text><name>Christina Gafar< /name><Time>1479029198161<//Time>< rate>

Covid era. Yamashiro is being used in the mornings by The Griddle Cafe! They have their delicious menu served outdoors in a beautiful spot up on the hill. There are heat lamps available for chilly mornings and the tables are place at six foot intervals. Parking is valet.< /Text>

<review>Location, location, location! This place has to coolest vibe and view of Hollywood that I have seen. The food was good but the server let me know that they are changing the menu soon. I will come back again to try the updated menu. I had the Chef Val roll as well as the Ube Molten Cake. Both were great.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Trendy Japanese-esque restaurant with views of LA. Came here for a birthday dinner, and they currently have outdoor and indoor seating during covid. They accept reservations for large groups (we had 8 people). Valet parking only ($12, credit cards accepted). Be prepared to wait - even though we had a reservation and the entire group was present, it still took about 20 minutes to get seated. They seem to put the bigger groups in the back of the restaurant, but if you come in a group of two, try to get seated by the garden (it’s very pretty). There’s a bar to grab a drink while you’re waiting or you can walk around and check out the views. There was a private event going on that night so unfortunately we weren’t able to see the golden Buddha.

Food-wise, it’s shareable plates. My thoughts are as follows:

- Grilled Branzino - the Angel hair pasta that accompanied the fish was the unexpected standout of the night. Get this.
- Duck salad: this was alright, I wish there was more dressing throughout the greens
- Lobster roll: our waiter recommended this; it’s a warm, saucy mess but it’s good
-Potstickers: standard fried dumplings; they come in four
-Soy ginger pork ribs: good dish to split; the sauce is on the sweeter side
-  Spicy prawn noodles: I liked the texture of the noodles and there was a subtle hint of spice, but note the two prawns’ heads are still attached. Our group ended up not eating the prawns (that reflects our own laziness than the restaurant), but good to note for larger groups who might be awkward about sharing
-Braised short rib: a bit disappointing; not as tender as I would’ve expected

Service-wise, our waiter was nice but did not check in on us. We had to flag multiple people down to get water refills. We were also not given an order of truffle chips but were still charged (our group just paid it anyways). Credit cards are accepted and you can split the check multiple ways. Note that you have to take stairs down to get to the bathrooms, and there was always a long line.

Overall, it’s a trendy restaurant and the building is pretty, but the food is of little substance. You’re paying for the views and the ambiance. Good for date nights/special occasions/when someone else is paying.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><review>Yamashiro Hollywood has a beautiful ambience with a relaxing environment. The original mansion was opened in 1914. It has been a historic landmark in Los Angeles for generations.

It has one of the best patio dinings in the city of Los Angeles. It offers a variety of Asian foods, although you may not find many or the most authentic Japanese sashimi here.

Daniel, the manager here, is friendly and wants to ensure all customers are happy and have good experiences in foods and enjoy sightseeing, etc.

Our waiter is also friendly and working hard.

We will come back again.<//review>< pictures>

The restaurant has a gorgeous view of Hollywood. The restaurant has a romantic vibe to it. The food is excellent! From the Wagyu beef, to the sushi, sashimi, tempura, appetizers and dessert! With great service, too! Nice place for a birthday dinner or when you're celebrating an occasion. They have $12 valet service. (It is on a hill and there is no parking outside the property.)< /text>

< review>
If you are looking for upscale Asian eats with a bomb environment, this is the place! Open zen garden with a pond, in an open to the sky views right inside! There were heat lamps along the outside that kept us comfortable! The food was a 3 stars at best. I expected more flavor and elevated service for the price but the ambiance was what made it four stars! The outdoor patio had tinkle lights and a wonderful view of the city. The valet and mini bar at the entrance was the best service of the place! Drinks was the best of the food and beverages! Later at night it gets a little more party scene which brings a younger crowd.< /review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>The food was good, the view is incredible, the server is very nice too. The reason I gave only 1 star was because of the disappointing seating experience.

We made reservation and when we got there there were plenty of empty seats (no reserved sign on it) with nice city overlook at the open patio area. I thought we would have the option to choose among those spots, however, skipping all the nice available seats, we were taken directly into probably the most hidden corner among the entire outdoor space with not a single view. When we asked for the other seat, we were told we had to wait at least 90 minutes which is RIDICULOUS.

After some back and forth, we got a good seat in the end. as we noticed, there were quite a lot empty seats all the time until we finished our dinner. Definitely not what they said reserved or anything. Anyway, that one thing made my entire dinning experience down to negative.< /review>< time>

The waiting area has a beautiful little garden with coi fish, tables and a bar. This is helpful as the wait time was 1.5 hours! Well worth the wait tho. Food was delicious. I ordered the Moonwalker tacos and my husband had the Grilled Shrimp & Pesto Melt. Both were delicious and filling. Huge portions! Had to take some of it with us lol. Griddle Cafe was hard to locate as it's inside the Yamashiro Restaurant and there are no signs, other than for Yamashiro.<//text>< pictures>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I randomly learned about the history of this place and was fascinated so I had to visit. It’s such a unique place, and so worth the trip. That said, the service was a little... odd. Just quirky stuff like multiple wrong dishes being sent to our table, having to repeat our order to the server a few minutes after the first time, lots of little stuff. Not a bad experience and very friendly, but just odd. Perhaps they’re just getting up to speed after reopening? The food was good and the drinks were very good. Such a charming place that the oddities were totally excusable. Excited to return again in the future!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf1f68d9c3e1:0xeb6245d12e254ab4< /Gmap_id></record>

I guess everyone else gets a table with a view and service to match. We got neither. We were seated in this weird, sad, indoor area. It was dark and we couldn’t even read the menu. So they turned up the lights… No real view to speak of, which was the entire reason for booking. The area was also subject to constant complaints from the other diners, which took up the waiters time, because he was moving them to an outdoor table. So by the time he got to us, it had been quite awhile. We ordered a sushi boat, but were informed that they didn’t do that for the night anymore. It was 9pm. So instead we got an assortment or rolls, which came out sporadically. So much so that the waiter wasn’t sure if we’d gotten all we ordered. Spent $300 anyways. Plus valet. Got to walk by the cool tables when I went to the bathroom, though. So that was fun. For lousy service and no view. I’ve been to happy hours better than this.< /review>

The food was fine, it's nothing to be particularly impressed by. We got the sushi boat which had decent quality fish

I must say the appetizers (bone marrow and calimari) was very good

To really get your money's worth from a dinner hear, take pictures and enjoy the scenery. Depending on where you sit, you'll either see a Japanese garden surrounded by other tables or the LA skyline. Both make the place to at least check out for a bit.</Text>

<Review>The food was delicious! The bone marrow was so soft and melty. The sushi was some of the best we have had and the créme brûlée was super yummy! The tomahawk needed a bit more salt but overall everything was fantastic. Service was above and beyond. All the staff was so so nice. Best place by far for its view. We will definitely be coming again soon! Hoping we can become regulars!

Side note: Valet is $12 but they take card or cash< /Review><username>Nicole Smith< /username><gmapID>0x80c2bf1f68d9c3e1:0xeb6245d12e254ab4< /gmapID>< resp>

I remember back in the day how amazing this restsurant was. It's not anymore. Inside seating lacks so much. They used to have seating in the courtyard which was beautiful giving the restaurant such an amazing vibe. Now the only good seating is outside and that's if it's warm out. The chef's special sushi was amazing...should be on the menu. The rest was ok...but not worth the price. Granted, your paying for the view not the food. The chicken skewers were raw and one bite was enough to make us sick. Drinks..? A skinny glass halfway filled with ice for 20$, no thank you. It was a rip off.  Sushi and view were the only good thing.< /review>

This restaurant is really amazing. You can tell they took their time with construction because the establishment is beautiful. It has the perfect views  so definitely be prepared for cute pics. Each staff member I interacted with had amazing energy which is so important these days. Out waiter Evan is the head server I believe and he was amazing! He made sure we had a good time and we're happy with our orders. If we weren't, he made sure to help us in anyway that he could. I really appreciate his personality and attentiveness. I  ordered the crispy duck salad and this was my 2nd time having duck since I went to London. They did a really good job and it was well seasoned, like I didn't have to add salt lol. 10/10 recommend! Being able to have some form of normalcy and go out to eat with friend after the 2020 chaos is extremely refreshing. If you're looking for a nice spot to finally get you out of the house, definitely come here!<//review>

Also, no body bussed the table, actually, a team member was clearing the table next to us with no customers, and we had to eat the dessert with the rest of the ramen and the pork ribs on the table. I liked the place and would recommend it, but i would suggest to train and couch the staff.<//Review>< Rate>

The view is very nice but honestly the food was whatever for how much it cost. You definitely pay for the view not the food. Also very small portions. Spent $150 on dinner and after leaving went and got food somewhere else.</Text>

<Text>First time going to this place with my friends. It was a great experience out of the normal going to restaurants due to the pandemic. They have outdoor dining with the view of the Griffith Observatory/Park, Hollywood Hills & at the distance, DTLA. The service was excellent (sorry I don't remember our server's name), thank you. The food was great, myself & my friends choices were delicious. We also had bottomless mimosas. The garden, the Pagoda, hotel with swimming pool, we did see & took pictures (can't help not to). Based on the whole experience it was a great choice! Definitely will be coming back!<//Text><Date>1600848317788<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The food is fairly good, but certainly not worth the prices (by any stretch). My waitress's (Meredith) performance was laughable for such an upscale place...her timing was absurdly uneven, she forgot a couple of things, and then inexplicably disappeared for ten minutes when I was wanting the check. The food servers and bussers were on point, though, and nice guys...so dinner wasn't a thoroughly disappointing experience. The view from the terraced seating was pretty amazing, but you can get an even better view from the hiking up to the observatory, and it's FREE.<//Text>< pictures>

Amazing location. Great food. Just knocked a star because they brought our food out at completely random times. I guess still a bit understaffed due to covid, but definitely still worth the experience.</Text>

Went there last night, with a group of 5 people. We didn’t get seated until 45 minutes after our reservation time. Took another 20 minutes for water to finally arrive at our table after asking for it 3 times. The food was mediocre. We picked about 5 appetizers, and all of them were bland. The bone marrow only had one piece of meat it in. Definitely not top of the line Japanese cuisine. We ordered a giant sushi boat for $200 thinking there would be some specialty rolls, and all we got was shashimi and California rolls. Super disappointed, we won’t be back. They only thing they have going for them is that they have a nice ambiance. It’s like meeting someone with a pretty face and no personality. It’s a shame that such a pretty place has bad service and weak food.</review>

I'm reviewing the location, architecture, and the ambiance of this spot and it's fantastic. Definitely a spot worth bringing in a date for a romantic night.

One of the most breath taking views of Los Angeles can be seen here at any time. My favorite is during sun set & the night lights. This place is very upscale. The place is beautiful. However, food is ok not all that for the price. When ordering different things a long period of wait can occur due to them having different kitchens, and its kinda disappointing when some ppl on your party are waiting for food and other finish when the rest of the food is brought. Service is great everyone is very nice and attentive. I will still be coming because the place is just so beautiful 😍 ✨</review>

Had a reservation for 8 PM - we got there about 5 minutes early, but had to wait until about 8:30 to seat, which I'm not taking stars off because the views of the city while waiting with drinks were amazing. Ended up getting steamed dumplings (Yum!), Ninja, Red Dragon, and Garlic Shrimp rolls, and all three were perfect. Then dessert was a brownie on chocolate ice cream on a waffle with nutella - glad we saved room!
Wait staff was personable and knowledgeable on the menu, and made the best Jack & Coke I've ever had by adding a little lime juice instead of just the garnish. Damage after everything (including $40 at the bar while waiting) was about $180 pre-tip (we tipped >20%, for reference), so didn't break the bank too bad for a lovely evening
I felt kind of bad afterward, but didn't end up tipping the valet since they raised their rates 20% from last year (unless it was just this weekend...), but the guy DID open the door for my lady even though they were busy, so sorry if you read this, bro!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFGjvuVoC7_LiY6JuXFKexoHrS6esg45dhFuFy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd-zoQh8NcfxYUL5gAe-78-ZFgIqb4skN3uPAd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD71PFocKG7kLk5e3hloHaFNwV8yCRf_152Dlq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgWAkfIvxS-YYZsn0B8rlN3MYIc6FE1UpJkMKS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

good food, but the establishment definitely lacks organization to the point where they had people with reservations waiting 2+ hours. Once again, good food, but definitely is not worth the wait time, the disrespectful hostesses (which I believe is resulted from stress of lack of staff), and the high tensioned environment you feel from the staff.

I believe either they need to invest in more staff or better organization, because they definitely seemed scattered.

Whoever is in the kitchen though is dishing out great food.<//text>

Absolutely breathtaking view and scenery. I love the food and the peaceful scenery. It's a great place for a 1st date and that's how I actually found out about it. Or just with friends to have a night of good food and drinks to unwind. One of my favorite places 😁<//review>

The view and ambiance, even with Covid-19 protocols in place, definitely 5 stars. The food averaged at 4, 4.5 stars for us from a taste perspective. For the price it tasted good, just not exceptional. It all looked beautiful so 5 stars for presentation, but again, just seemed to not get me to the 5 stars. The roasted bone marrow bruschetta was delicious but they didn't have enough crostini for the toppings, the edamame was great with the truffle oil but wasn't a great value at $16. The pork belly yakitori seemed to be unevenly grilled so the fatty parts were a little undercooked while the meat itself was a little dry. The wagyu beef with garlic yakitori was much better. The hibachi pineapple fried rice was one of the highlights for us. The 6 year old loved it and they were able to accommodate for egg allergies. We dug out the rest of the pineapple after eating all the rice so it was a little dessert too. The Ishi Yaki cooking stone with American wagyu was delicious and enough to share for 2 people although 1 person could eat it all if they didn't order anything else. If this was all we ordered it would have been 5 stars. The spicy tuna crispy rice for a thumbs down from our party as the sweet sauce was over powering and not disclosed on the menu so that brought our rating down by a lot. For dessert we ordered the chocolate drama and shared it... It could have used some whipped cream or more berries - something to cut all the chocolate sweetness to it but perhaps that was intentional for the drama! Overall will definitely go again just will steer clear of the crispy rice and pork belly offerings.< /Text>

<text>Accommodated our request to be seated by the banister so that we could have a view of the city. Evan our waiter was outstanding and attentive, helped make sure we got our order modified properly for a shellfish allergy. Sushi was good, ambiance was great. Will be back again!</text>< Pictures>

This place is up on the hills of Hollywood the streets are very narrow but able to get to it! It is a very big restaurant with beautiful Japanese well trim gardens and the view is absolutely amazing! This is a place to take your spouse or that important significant person for a well prepared cooked and decorated meal and a cocktail. The gardens extend on the lower levels and is breathtaking to sit and engulf the nature!< /Review>

Stunning view ... they were definitely running behind in the reservation department.. 730pm res but had to wait in the cold for 30 min. That is why I gave them 4 stars. Food is also only 4 stars as it costs more than it should for the quality. Music gets 2.5 stars .. not good.. I did not understand. Would I go back yes but for drinks, appetizers, and the view  only.</Review>

<Review>The restaurant is beautiful and the views don't get much better than this. I highly recommend going at night.

There's a small Japanese garden outside located in middle of the restaurant, can I live here, please?

The cocktails and food are overall very good. It's not going to be the best sushi and food you've had but it fits the overall quality and ambiance of this restaurant. Enough to earn 4 stars and a recommendation to come here with friends, a date, or hell, go by yourself and you'll still have a relaxing time.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This was actually for The Griddle who happens to be at Yamashiros during the day.  The place was packed but we only had to wait about 10 minutes because there was only two of us.  It was chilly even during the day but then it was also overcast.  I would definitely suggest having their giant pancakes.</review>

The good: Views, ambiance, location

The bad: Food

The ugly: Customer service

Seriously. Went tonight for the first time. The location was cool, as was the atmosphere. Definitely great for a date or a special night out, but the views are about where the good ends. The customer service was terrible. It was a little busy, but it wasn’t anything outside of what you would expect for a place like that. I’ve had better service at a Buffalo Wild Wings during a Pittsburgh Steelers playoff game and a NASCAR race. My group of 6 had to ask multiple times for drinks. We ordered Edamame as an appetizer and it didn’t come until it was asked for again and an hour after the main courses came out. Half of my group didn’t get their fried rice until an hour after the other half got their sushi rolls. When we asked why fried rice was taking over an hour and a half to be served, our waitress was completely ignored by her manager and in turn we were completely ignored by her until our food finally came out. Our food was mediocre at best. My local sushi place could give this place a run for their money in terms of flavor and quality.  Very underwhelming service and food quality. Truly sad for a place with so much potential.</text>

Really cheap and delicious Japanese food is available in this restaurant! I felt like I was in Japan when I ate the food. I didn't regret my decision to have dinner at this restaurant. The rates were so nice in the pocket. I'm sure I'm going to invite my cousins to eat here. You're always servicing what's best for your clients!</Text>

The views are fantastic and the grounds are beautiful but they ruined it all by serving mediocre food and offering poor service. Its not worth going into all the details of the meal and our experience, it was take and out food quality at best.< /Text>

One of the most breath taking views of Los Angeles can be seen here at any time. My favorite is during sun set & the night lights. This place is very upscale. The place is beautiful. However, food is ok not all that for the price. When ordering different things a long period of wait can occur due to them having different kitchens, and its kinda disappointing when some ppl on your party are waiting for food and other finish when the rest of the food is brought. Service is great everyone is very nice and attentive. I will still be coming because the place is just so beautiful 😍 ✨</text>

Absolutely breathtaking view and scenery. I love the food and the peaceful scenery. It's a great place for a 1st date and that's how I actually found out about it. Or just with friends to have a night of good food and drinks to unwind. One of my favorite places 😁</Review>

Special place, landmark that need to be preserved ! I was lucky that during this crazy time they opened for the weekend and I was able to reserve a table, food very good, great service and the view with the landscape and the architecture really complement each other for a unique experience:)< /Review>

I recently took my partner for an anniversary brunch here. First off the view was amazing! It was a little on the pricey side but that’s expected for location, and the quality.

There was a great selection of seafood and breakfast foods. Fresh made sushi, Oysters, omelette station, and the desserts amazing!

If you can get a table on the inside of the restaurant they have a Japanese garden that is splendid. It gets very busy so reserve a table on there website to guarantee a good spot.<//Review>

Beautiful restaurant.
You may need a reservation to have dinner there. It's huge, but also full of people.
Food is delicious. Very taste.
The atmosphere is incredible!
The only thing that causes a little headache was the payment. They passed the card 3 times, luck us, the bank blocked those transactions, otherwise, we would be charged 3 times the same amount. Be careful!
Besides that, it was a good experience.< /text>

There's a reason that the Hollywood Sunset Hike goes here for the final views. Yamashiro is worth visiting just to see the gardens and the amazing view. If you are already planning on visiting Hollywood, this is an easy stop to add.< /Text>

Din LA was amazing and made experiencing this restaurant affordable. The ambiance was amazing. Had a new bartender and had several wrong cocktails but the service made up for it. The sea bass was phenomenal!!!</Review>

AMAZING! I cannot recommend this place enough. Location alone is enough to give it 5 starts but the food was also amazing. The wagyu nigiri is absolutely to die for. The service is great and they always go above and beyond. You can tell they really care about customer services. Will definitely be returning.<//Review>

The company I work for reserved the restaurant for our holiday party.  Although we had some rain on our drive in, the views were still amazing.

The ambiance also felt very relaxed and I did not feel out of place.  I was very pleased to be able to see Hollywood, Downtown LA, nearby mountains and hills.

This place is easy to get to, so I will add this to my list of places to go back to and visit again.

I also enjoyed the Buddha statue and was able to walk downstairs. I didn't get to see the other gardens and their poolside bar, but I can imagine that during the day time, it is just as gorgeous.

The staff on hand were very courteous and attentive with everyone!  I enjoyed my experience based on the Holiday party that was hosted.<//review>

The atmosphere and food was amazing, but I’m giving it four stars because our waiter seemed to disappear quite a bit, and my daughter who is vegan got a vegan sushi dish that was half the size of a regular sushi dish. Vegans are any less hungry than normal people!<//text>

They're having trouble with the pace of the service during the pandemic. Took a long time for each order and food item to happen. I would have liked to order another sushi roll but I wanted to get home sometime this week.</Text>

This place is tucked away in the Hollywood hills.

Just pulling up makes you feel like a VIP.

The atmosphere was magical, and the wait staff was stellar.

My girlfriend and I were offered complimentary hors d’oeuvres and champagne before ordering.

The food was delicious, there was a live violinist and pianist.

Not to mention the view was breathtaking.

We will definitely be returning here for date nights!< /Review>

Wonderful Mother’s Day quarantine option. We loved coming for the winter night market previously but the Mother’s Day brunch was a delight. Curbside pickup of lots of yummy dishes - favorites were the vegan yamashiro roll, chicken and waffles, and avocado toast. This setting is just amazing, views are beautiful. In the heart of the city and yet so removed and private!  Can’t wait to eat in the beautiful dining room again - it’s like a little trip to Japan with a lot less travel;) Was a great workout when we came in winter via metro and walked up, parking up top is easier with quarantine.<//text>

Beautiful view, and they have great cocktails. One weird thing though is that they played the same song about 15 times in a row very loudly, it kind of took away from the experience.</Text>

Please allow us to show you the level of food we offer.'}< /resp><Text>Beyond disappointed, Keep in mind we had 2 drinks each before our food, so it should’ve tasted decent. We ended up ordering 7 dishes and gave up after the pineapple fried rice which is the only good thing on the menu. The avocado rice cakes tasted as if they mopped the floor with the fried rice, then threw old guacamole in a bag from chipotles trash can on top. I almost threw up when I started chewing. It was one of my favorite foods I’m literally traumatized. We decided to order dessert to end the night on a more positive note only to be further traumatized. I could go to erewhone and get a better fruit tart in a plastic box then what we we served. This place is a literal joke nothing high end about this place but the view. Food is terrible great for pictures.</Text><userid>116511243778161649517< /userid><Rate>1< /Rate><date>1616898849988< /date>< Pics>

<review>Very affordable and tasty Japanese foods are available in this restaurant! When I ate the food, I felt like I was in Japan. I didn't regret my decision to have my dinner in this restaurant. The prices were so friendly to the pocket. I will surely invite my cousins to eat here. You keep on servicing what is best for your customers!< /review>< pictures>

Lovely garden, gorgeous city view and beautiful courtyard. Worth visiting! It's nothing like the gardens you see in Japan but it's beautiful nonetheless. The food and drinks are average at best but it is a popular place for the aforementioned reasons. We went for the seasonal night market which was nice: food trucks, live music, retail pop ups. Nice but nothing special.< /text>

There's a reason that the Hollywood Sunset Hike goes here for the final views. Yamashiro is worth visiting just to see the gardens and the amazing view. If you are already planning on visiting Hollywood, this is an easy stop to add.< /Text>

AMAZING! I cannot recommend this place enough. Location alone is enough to give it 5 starts but the food was also amazing. The wagyu nigiri is absolutely to die for. The service is great and they always go above and beyond. You can tell they really care about customer services. Will definitely be returning.< /text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>The company I work for reserved the restaurant for our holiday party.  Although we had some rain on our drive in, the views were still amazing.

The ambiance also felt very relaxed and I did not feel out of place.  I was very pleased to be able to see Hollywood, Downtown LA, nearby mountains and hills.

This place is easy to get to, so I will add this to my list of places to go back to and visit again.

I also enjoyed the Buddha statue and was able to walk downstairs. I didn't get to see the other gardens and their poolside bar, but I can imagine that during the day time, it is just as gorgeous.

The staff on hand were very courteous and attentive with everyone!  I enjoyed my experience based on the Holiday party that was hosted.<//Text>< Name>

The atmosphere and food was amazing, but I’m giving it four stars because our waiter seemed to disappear quite a bit, and my daughter who is vegan got a vegan sushi dish that was half the size of a regular sushi dish. Vegans are any less hungry than normal people!<//text>

<Text>Beautiful location and ambiance. Sunday brunch was good, but selections were limited, especially at the sushi and desert tables. And, if you don't drink Mimosas, you're charged for each orange juice and any other beverages. Omelette station made it a 4-star experience for me.</Text><Response>{'time': 1537553000053, 'text': "Thank you for your wonderful compliments, Rosemarie.

It was my first time visiting this restaurant, but I already love it. I thanked you for serving dishes that really match the taste of your customers. Your staff and crew were also very professional and friendly. I hope you will continue serving for the best service! Thank you! I will highly recommend your restaurant!< /review>

Maybe we didn’t make the right choices of the foods, the veggies tempura, grilled octopus and beef was just ok, but the main dishes really tasted..., the chicken breast was too dry, the burger doesn’t as juicy as Friday’s, the see bass’s combination with dry butter cream pasta was just a mess, we also order 5 kind of sashimi, but looks not quite fresh, the taste also not quite good, not sure how long they put meat in the fridge, so didn’t take the pic for that, the food quality didn’t match the price.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Fine dining at its best.
DATE SAVING TIP: The seating with the best view is primarily for groups of four or more. The intimate seating for two, may land you on the level below other dinners and it feels like if they cough, it'll come down on you and your meal, so when making a reservation, be very specific about where you are seated. Upper level or right by the windows. (You'll be so happy for this tip once there) The food is a foodie's paradise and the ambience is perhaps top five in Los Angeles.< /review>

In town for TCM Film Fest & staying down the street. On an unassuming corner near an almost comically sketchy motel sits Shin Hollywood. Terrific, freshly made, good prices. We're in town for a few days & will definitely return.</review>

I had some really good sushi here...maybe the best I’ve ever had. I would definitely go back here again for another special occasion. FYI valet is currently $12 and mandatory because of the way the restaurant is situated up on a hill.</Review>< pics>

This place is pretty awesome. First off the view is amazing. They are located way up in the Hollywood Hills and have a perfect view of LA County. We were fortunate and got a clear night, we were able to see as far as Long Beach. This place is definitely pricey but worth the experience. I ordered the A5 Wagyu which was my first experience with Japanese wagyu and, oooo weee, it tasted like butter. I've eaten American Wagyu many times and it sure doesn't compare. Well worth the trip!< /Text>

<Review>I love this restaurant! The ambiance was very comfortable and inviting. Everything you see on their fabulous menu was a little bit pricey, but once you taste it, you can definitely say why? It was a wonderful restaurant with an inventive good cooking, a lovely atmosphere, and helpful and efficient staff.

<review>If you come to Hollywood CA and you want to see the City at night and eat really good food you have to go to Yamashiro Restaurant. The food is really good and the service is awesome very polite and helpful. I ordered the Sea Bass 😁 it was awesome. I came early to to see the garden it's small but very nice. When you come make sure you get the view of the city it's really nice.👍👍< /review>< user_id>

You may need a reservation to have dinner there. It's huge, but also full of people.
Food is delicious. Very taste.
The atmosphere is incredible!
The only thing that causes a little headache was the payment. They passed the card 3 times, luck us, the bank blocked those transactions, otherwise, we would be charged 3 times the same amount. Be careful!
Besides that, it was a good experience.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPafapsfemsdjdc-CpjT-CxeJKJIQ9D-RGkrEu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGZKZztLGOUJnmW7E9uS0mMC47tsSGmFAFAeox=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe31BkW_5TKjNpmJxYee1pibCvDhunhVsm4eo4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiwtAH7TyZ9VOl6LGgBHm1RIDmhTh0pATI4t0X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOwWgSi25sfgMUo4i8PzZxWzP8WXCXHI65eUJR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxDEe8wIEbcrwnQUfTV-tKmvIUOCO80F3mNSyX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK7xiIGVv4GTrHspJPnqweeIj8gNEI_I7lVg29=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGxmNwDEIscSgcQrflIQuSrB5yj6TQCHGeU-q3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7ZWy3tMi4NUsSWB9pLiWFKiniZk7pJwaV6Iiw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNLzitxCWyQgKWlRNIU5Fy0yb0ZeV4s2jssAgN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bf1f68d9c3e1:0xeb6245d12e254ab4< /GmapID></record>

Special place, landmark that need to be preserved ! I was lucky that during this crazy time they opened for the weekend and I was able to reserve a table, food very good, great service and the view with the landscape and the architecture really complement each other for a unique experience:)< /Review>

Exquisite dinning experience no doubt, but service was pretty bad. We had a reservation but still had to wait for a table and then after being seated we waited over 30 minutes before a waiter came up to us, this after inquiring about a waiter several times and being assured that “he will be right with you”.< /review>

Not what it use to be...

Yamashiro left me wanting less, the food lackluster and the service inexperienced.

Customer service: Although there were many food runners there were few waiters. Our waiter seemed to be all over the place and spread thin. While we were still waiting for another dish and our dessert we were already given our check! Like wait... a minute?!
We spent about 15 minutes waiting for soy sauce to a point where our crispy rice sushi became stale. Then about another 30 minutes after we finished our entree to get dessert....We ended up canceling our nigiri sushi that we ordered in the beginning because it never came out.

Food: We ordered uni sushi (never got), sushi tacos, A5 waygu surf and turf appetizer, tuna crispy rice, yellowtail crispy rice, ramen, branzino yuzu pasta, panna cotta. The flavor was mediocre, nothing ground breaking. You’re paying for the view not the flavor or quality of the food.

To clarify we ordered from the DineLA menu as well as the regular menu, our bill was about $275. We don't expect special treatment but if we're going to spend our money at least get the food out in a timely matter or be apologetic that it didn't?

Save your money, go to a local Japanese izakaya.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>The sushi was top notch. Spring rolls and other finger foods were up to par on the flavor scale. The salmon slider was a bit salty but the other flavors were nice. Here for a party so no traditional sit down dinner. But the ambience, calm atmosphere and that remarkable view can't be beat. You must try Yamashro's at least once. A rainy night!</text>< pictures>

<Review>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND RUIN YOUR NIGHT! We had a reservation for 7 at 9 pm. We arrived at our scheduled time and were told that our table wouldn't be ready for 25 minutes. We waited and were seated inside the courtyard when we were promised a table outside with a view. The drinks took 30 minutes to reach the table. At around 10:30 pm, they brought the soy sauce to the table. We noticed that the soy sauce pot was infested with 100s of ants. No exaggeration. We informed the wait staff and they acted as if it wasn't a big deal. We had to ask them to wipe down the table given that the ants had spread at this time. Crawling on our chopsticks and small plates. The manager never visited the table. We had to go to the hostess stand to ask for the manager who stated they had a big ant problem. By 11 PM, no mains reached the table and the waiter offered us an order of truffle edamame from the manager. Our party of 7 decided to leave. We will certainly never return and will never recommend this place. Highly disappointed and a waste of our Saturday night on our trip to LA.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The 3 stars are for the view not the food. For food, I won’t even bother to rate it.

With a Japanese name and nice exterior and interior, I expected that it’s a good Japanese restaurant but unfortunately it’s absolutely disappointing.

We ordered spicy garlic edamame to begin with and it’s served in a minute or so. Obviously it’s pre-made and ready to serve. One of the worst edamames we had.

To go with the sushi boat, we ordered a small bottle of nigori that’s sold in the supermarket $8-$10 but sold at $42 here.

When the sushi boat was served, my hubby and I were both a bit shocked. First the boat itself probably needed some repainting or something. For a $120 sushi boat for 2 people, I guess I expected more than just all-you-can-eat quality of fish. The quality of the fish they used to make the nigiris and rolls was way below average. You can see from the pieces of nigiris, they were pre-cut, dry and of course not fresh. The shrimp tempuras of the rolls were not fresh. No question that the tempuras were sitting under the hot light for some time. The two rolls were quite the same with tempura inside, the difference was that one was with salmon and Serrano chilly on top, the other one with spicy tuna. You can tell from the colour of the fish, they were all-you-can-eat sushi quality. The fish for the rolls were even worse. And the size of the nigiri was tiny!

We didn’t see at all the tables around us anyone ordered sushi, everyone else was eating hamburgers and ribs. It’s just not a place for sushi. But isn’t this a Japanese restaurant?

It is sad to see a nice Japanese style property not serving authentic traditional Japanese. The only Japanese things in this restaurant are just the name and the decors. It’s certainly a shame.</Text><userid>100598276512819858255< /userid>< username>

Hands down, the freshest sashimi rolls I've ever had in my life! The ordering process is super simple: you walk in, grab a menu and a pencil, and go ahead and seat yourself at the bar in the center of the restaurant. The service was quick and efficient.  I ordered 3 hand rolls, which is only $11. This comes with salmon, scallop, and crab. The seafood is so fresh and delicious. The chef makes the rolls right in front of you and hands you a roll at a time. Make sure to eat the roll immediately while it's warm and fresh! This place has definitely been one of the highlights of my trip in LA so far!</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Such an amazing experience. I came for my birthday dinner and I had the most splendid time! The food is spectacular and the view is jaw dropping. On the food side of things the things that stood out were the crab cakes and the honey Siracha shrimp. These two items are an absolute must! If you get nothing else you have to get these two. The most amazing crab cakes I’ve ever had, and I literally get them every time I see them on the menu. You must also try the donuts! Absolutely amazing! The preserves that are inside taste so fresh!!!! The donut tastes kind of like a very fluffy and airy churro. The spicy garlic edamame is amazing too! I could have drank the garlic and the sauce they dress it in. Honestly every single thing I ordered was delicious! As for the sushi, I got the ninja ;which was my favorite of the two, and the white dragon. Both extremely fresh and delicious. When coming here expect nothing but the best time and vibes. The employees are so helpful and attentive. Everyone inside are having a good time with you, it’s very euphoric. Oh and be prepared to eat with the most amazing view of los angles. I suggest going around 5 so you can see the sunset. I can’t stress enough how fantastic the ambiance is. Grounds that this place is on is amazing. You could just walk around for like 30 minutes gazing at the city and sitting by the pond listening to the water run. All in all the place is an absolute must!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9OMO4dggtqw72M5oKIjORIO34xheKQqIEZl9L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEK4OPLJaRjOBGguKU0YxYAePkqHzE_sZDHdnV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeFckYBQPIOHQO06eLaOu6rpY6W4xpoIGXWmIe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG-4cIyymwTv_vfSi8pTj7qZHfRaNa1J02v6BO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPIRJ5tcRgH5zyqf-lEqzbgy2Z0bApFIS3nVsn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1r7kchiqhqoworAZVJa9mjEpTXJoad3yJiUqq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_3oKxbd0nooEb1UDBOswjF52iqacPvb-6eCeK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-hFiEKu0HUhHSq_Kuq_HbND3M49gepihIdbc9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHXn5jwaRbNskWdavgS_klkky00NwQpu0M6Y22=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlWQehF2PagpllZ2cY-gmq5n50R1ntveG6blrd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8N-fR3H0q_j23ZG1GMfiI3ICscqCw2exsKksg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmUJ3uo_rQZOSRfntcc09YZHow_IzDqBH-PcGw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTCMDX0oq0a4Ww3fmOKpsXWcA7pxReCPVwbxeW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY4Nm4p6G4bGcfiHPdNISRPD2FbN2rjV1nchnT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGenn-5PedUyhgruRSyqzu54-icKAHv-5ozNsp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPey6ZWSt1PggtHW3ZQj8kjetZWQETAgmdg6VK1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtI2pND--22gBxbcZry8XbVCJ4TKAEg_4VkCM4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP84QeN0O8uU9qNqnyTp8SLCHggBgxCIMhwrJo8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMn8vylm3Vk68Pv50r1S6NlFvF6M1STI-s9FfC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnoN6Iyp4c-ZG-bzcXpeTBGNEmpgYuXtAwi-zT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEn3-jrIPMv6aGpQAOygEw7d7u7SSCDHzfIez0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM74PZch9SeRDdZqfNsujjc7TfDrJA39H_rScWF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_sUkKrp9mfa8rOw2FLJqsTyUfl2UO8FcHw-O7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZRqhiEAqj7S3J4p2sZVJJ5qX4VGhcve6iisn6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIVF4lYvqpaNs_CEtD9PDEwagwfRkh7yfpS00y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnpufXZ_Cw71oYKIuLn8NzgUWnl9dLKMbeu5Id=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN_uBpY1LCuSltNXNimxu4UDpij_Dg_NHRpn39=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_y7xH13PIc9RRBFLBJY_LY8VkT1aRGw6BSP8a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwDfrrJsiyPAygfbZVtNP6_LcFSCfiayKvCH_I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGZbeUT1-9BiRGnQOu6OQmg0AZ8r2ziWhy9_V2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfbFvn7WNKwT-Ez26eALEjsEi8Z-BIeHtzCfIm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2Id386Kjt_ElB8NFimzKmUxMeNzT-y94WZ2Rm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzdIWKq-UZXb0KiUuVeF8um5gra8N6a0EJ8B04=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTW02MbOacKNgYZvOAJ-Br_1_5EtMX_au8Gqfh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiI3g16mn3O8VW2vc2kLtWHcjTFM7qvTwOdcgv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeIiB6TKYNAuikIMFcIce3LKXq9K4uQI-5jSiY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8c1jDuzkfk7aIuwIkLBdkk-chdW33S-iAIDVv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM14r5l7U51dByedOAGmBZe6L_kjya2dcD7w9km=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjV5fECXRSLz1rqN0A_R0PFEmxsBlEzsgsOhSg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

This place's been always considered as one of top 5 places in LA with great city views. Inside of the restaurant, it has kind of mix of tradtional and modern vibe. Food is great with a wide range of prices for sure. The Japanese garden feels exotic and its surrounding view is spectacular and great! Highly recommended!</review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>My husband and I came during the weekday pretty early, just after 6pm and there was no wait. Service was incredibly quick, efficient and attentive, pretty perfect. We got the famous lemon roll, crunchy dragon roll, something else I can't recall and since I'm not much of a raw fish eater my husband got 5 different fresh fish sushi. We were stuffed by the end, we probably could have done without the third roll but oh well. The staff refilled our waters constantly and the food was incredible, fresh and SO quick. The ambiance was nice too, quiet and calm really catered to the client to enjoy the food. Slightly pricey but worth it I think.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I recently took my partner for an anniversary brunch here. First off the view was amazing! It was a little on the pricey side but that’s expected for location, and the quality.

There was a great selection of seafood and breakfast foods. Fresh made sushi, Oysters, omelette station, and the desserts amazing!

If you can get a table on the inside of the restaurant they have a Japanese garden that is splendid. It gets very busy so reserve a table on there website to guarantee a good spot.< /text>

I came here after the Los Angeles county had just opened in door dining. It was a very windy day and they had sat us in an open area and no heater was provided until the last 10 minutes that I was there. They kept bringing us the wrong food and had to wait a long time for the waitress to come in order to ask for refills and napkins. The waitress kept apologizing for the inconvenience and that the owner pushed the limits with understaff.< /Text>

< Review>
Ate here for the first time on vacation and was blown away by the ambiance!!!

Driving up you need to valet your car (which I expected by online reviews). We took a few minutes to look around, take pictures etc. we were created by friendly hosts, asking us where we would like to sit. We got a great view of the city and had friendly conversation with the lady sitting across from us.

A little later on, as we were working our way through the menu, live piano music started and I was blown away by the renditions of current songs on the piano (wish I could find the artist’s name.) We had the best time and made our trip to La that much better!!<//Review>

Beautiful place to eat with even better views. The front desk lady was sooo nice and helpful, she went above and beyond and seated us even without reservations!(our first time there). The Filet Mignon was soo tender yiu can cut it with a spoon. I recommend the "Double Happiness" drink.</review>

<username>Car Are<//username><Review>A good place to celebrate a special occasion, the service was on cue, food was very good,  but be careful what you order as it can become very pricey.  For two you can spend $$ to $$$ or more, or you can stop just for drinks at the bar, a lively environment with live jazz music,  at least on this night. The location is amazing, up in the hills with an overview of Hollywood and other near cities. A very nostalgic location that has been around since the early 19 hundreds. I won't tell you everything as you need to check it ot for yourselves.  Enjoy.
BTW, the buddha is about 600 years old, at least that's what I was told.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< user_id>

<review>A historic restaurant on the mountain side in Hollywood. The restaurant is not easy to get to and neither is the valet parking. The restaurant has a garden overlooking a great view of Los Angeles. The restaurant is definitely a place requiring time to look at all of its features. The restaurant is a little dark to create a romantic environment as it overlooks the evening sky of Los Angeles. The staff is helpful and responsive. The food is delicious.< /review>< Rate>

<gmapID>0x80c2bf1f68d9c3e1:0xeb6245d12e254ab4< /gmapID><Text>You are definitely just  paying for the view.... We (party of 4) arrived on time , 6 pm as scheduled. We waited 30 minutes to be seated , they were fast on getting our order but we waited more than an hour for the food to be serve. We ordered tomahawk steak and wagyu beef over heated stone but the tomahawk was already cold and the heated stone was not hot enough to cook the side veggies included in the meal. We told  our server and he said he will send us a new heated stone but nothing came until we finished eating so we end up not eating the uncooked veggies. And worse thing, the person serving the food accidentally dropped 2 plates of dumpling plates on the floor , flashing all the orange colored mayonnaise sauce over my chanel purse and my suede boots. It was a traumatic bday experience for me. But Im not blaming the employees, maybe they were understaffed and they’re exhausted. Thank you to all the employees who work hard and serve us during this Covid time.< /Text>< Name>

<review>Out exploring LA for the day with a friend who brought me here. It was not only a fun surprise but what an amazing view. A 180 shot from the ocean to the mountains. They were close on MLK day so we didn't get inside but no body was around... so peaceful and serine with nothing but blue skies and sunshine pouring the beauty of mother nature into our eyes!</review><user_id>108499370146122142862</user_id><date>1549517341704</date><name>Kandi Hollinger<//name></record>

Yamashiro is one of the coolest places to visit in Hollywood. It is a world away from the tourist crowds and offers unmatched views. We were there for sunset and dinner.  Spectacular! Our server, named Asia, was attentive and helpful. The food was fantastic. We will be back often!<//Text>

Beautiful spot in Los Angels for sushi, ramen or steak. Great wine selection too, this is definitely a place you shouldn’t be concerned with the prices because it’s pricey. Happy that there’s hardly any kids to spoil the atmosphere plus that it has such a beautiful view too!<//Text>

I came here last night for dinner and ordered the 8oz filet mignon. Ordered it medium and came more medium well, but none the less it was still quite tasty if I may say so. It's still a lovely place for one going out for a date night.</text>

Exceptional food and cocktails. Try the roasted chicken it's superb. Also the bar tender makes a delicious drink with banana liquor. Don't know the name of the drink but it's very good.</Text>

<Text>Yamashiro is beautiful and the food is decent. Definitely go for the sushi. What ruined the experience for me is the fact that there are floaties in the pool by the Pagoda bar, guests are showing up to dine in gym clothes and tennis shoes, and they play club type music instead of traditional Japanese music. It makes you feel like this place is really nothing special, and it is. Bring back the class, yamashiro - maybe then I'll be back.<//Text>< Pics>

Up on a hill overlooking all of Hollywood, what's not to love. Awesome atmosphere! Make sure to check out the Japanese garden, its beautiful! Had Sunday mimosas and brunch with a wide selection to choose from. Our waiter Scott was amazing! Next time we head down to LA we will be stopping by again!< /Review>

Amazing restaurant,  the food is so good, they have Asian inspired food mainly Japanese and the service is excellent.  Our waitress was so good and attentive.   They have a great setup outside for spaced seating and keeping everyone safe. The view is the best thing in the world. You get an unobstructed view of Hollywood and the westside.  On a clear day you can see all the way to the ocean. Its not cheap so we save it for a special occaison..</Review>

Cons: quality of the noodle. It taste very powdery and looked not so fresh.
Good thing about this place: soup was nicely hot. Not a lot of ramen in the states aren't hot enough.   Taste of the soup is okay but not my favorite.<//Text>< Pics>

Celebrated my birthday and was so disappointed wish I would have gone somewhere else. Service was bad but the food was worse. My salmon was raw and my Brussels where burned. Aside from that it was bland not even a little salt and pepper.  So disappointed. Definitely will not be going back. 👎🏼</Text>

You have breath taking views from your seat as you dine in or out front by the bar. There are beautiful gardens here along with coy fish ponds. The food here is great from the juicy chicken to the fresh cooked vegetables. Definitely an upscale romantic place to have dinner. Also nice to know that this place has been here for over 100 years.< /Review>< pictures>

<user_id>108016779184505423739</user_id><text>I could not remember the time of my reservation so I called this morning, afternoon and evening trying to get a hold of someone to find out what was the time of my reservation. Thinking it was 7p or 730p we got to the restaurant at 736p and our reservation was for 8pm. The hostess originally told me we would have a table on the inside and that our table would be ready within 5 to 10 mins and we would get a text message when it is time for us to be seated. Fasr forward to 815p and we have not received a text message. My friend and I go up to the hostess desk and ask about our table and they say they called my name ten minutes ago. Last time I was here when they needed to locate a guest they came and found us and I'm pretty sure they gave our original table away.</text>< name>

There are very few properties in Los Angeles with the sweeping views this amazing location can provide. The interior decor has been maintained exactly the way it was built almost 60 years ago. It is really worth the trip for that alone. The drinks are excellent and if you like Japanese food you can't go wrong here. It amazes me that this iconic restaurant does not have lines out the door every night. It's one of my favorite places in LA.< /Text>

<Review>The atmosphere here is incredible. I had no idea they had this palace on the hill. The food here is only outdone by the view. You won't regret making a reservation. Also, plan on valet parking, it's $10, and it saves you a lot of trouble. Otherwise there is a shuttle. This is a beautiful location with delicious food and a friendly staff.  Bring a group, bring a camera, bring your appetite.< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Came here for dinner and this place is clearly overrated and overpriced. The place itself is outstandingly pretty and offers a great view of LA. But the food was really disappointing, especially considering the price ($30-50 per entree). Some dishes like sushi rolls were okay good, but nothing amazing. Other dishes like noodles, fried rice or meats were fairly blend and already medium-temp when served.< /review>< pics>

It's been years since weve returned and Yamashiro still holds true to its character. Great views atop the hills of a Hollywood. We enjoyed a quick lunch before a play.<//review>

Perfect for a quick bite that isn't fast food! Medium sauce is perfect for someone who likes it spicy, but not too spicy. It was just right. I would come back for sure.< /review>

Recommended as a date night place. This place is a bit pricey. I wouldn't call the food here Japanese. At least half of the menu you can find at a regular seafood restaurant.< /review><rating>4<//rating><user>105494024958633338241< /user>< pics>

INCREDIBLE place. The best part of this place is not even the food or the service it’s the VIEW. The view is absolutely STUNNING. By far the best view I’ve ever seen in a restaurant. The service was really good. The ribs were delicious. The sushi was amazing. The octopus was incredible. The fried shrimp was wonderful. And the chocolate cake was awesome. While being pretty expensive, I had a GREAT experience and while probably come here again. I recommend going here for dinner because the lighting is very nice. By far one of the best restaurants in Hollywood.<//Text>

You are definitely just  paying for the view.... We (party of 4) arrived on time , 6 pm as scheduled. We waited 30 minutes to be seated , they were fast on getting our order but we waited more than an hour for the food to be serve. We ordered tomahawk steak and wagyu beef over heated stone but the tomahawk was already cold and the heated stone was not hot enough to cook the side veggies included in the meal. We told  our server and he said he will send us a new heated stone but nothing came until we finished eating so we end up not eating the uncooked veggies. And worse thing, the person serving the food accidentally dropped 2 plates of dumpling plates on the floor , flashing all the orange colored mayonnaise sauce over my chanel purse and my suede boots. It was a traumatic bday experience for me. But Im not blaming the employees, maybe they were understaffed and they’re exhausted. Thank you to all the employees who work hard and serve us during this Covid time.< /Text>

Exceptional food and cocktails. Try the roasted chicken it's superb. Also the bar tender makes a delicious drink with banana liquor. Don't know the name of the drink but it's very good.</review>

Incredible views and an amazing setting add to the wow factor of this hilltop restaurant. We ordered 3 starters and two plates of sushi - salt and pepper calamari, pork dumplings, crab cakes, California tempura roll, and wagyu beef nigiri. Generally the food was great, but the calamari was battered in something that made it armour-plated and the tempura roll was actually the entire roll, deep fried, which cooked the salmon. It was tasty but lost all of the freshness I was expecting from the roll. $10 for a single bottle of Asahi was also pretty scandalous.
A great experience but very expensive and food not quite on a par with the setting.</text>

My husband an I were visiting from Hawaii. We went to Yamashiros for a nice date night in Hollywood. Our expectations were surpassed. We had a wonderful dinner with an amazing view. Atmosphere is dark and busy but the food and location was great. Great place for celebration or nice date.< /text>

Yamashiro means castle in the mountain.

There is a Japanese style buidling
on the Hollywood hills.

Therefore, you can easily see whole
city of Hollywood and Los Angeles
from this restaueant.

Especially, night scenery is really good.

You can choose  assorted Sushi,
Sashimi, Prawn& Scallop, Baby Back Rib,
Salmon etc. from the menu.

Foods are tasty and Scenery is good.

You can see Japanese style garden
in the middle of the restaurant.</Review>

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and the only place we though of was Yamashiro. We enjoyed our experience to the max, our server Alex is a an absolute pro, and was on top of our evening. Can't say enough, thank you Alex. The food and drinks are next level fantastic, so tasty and delicate. We enjoyed a burger meal, plus sushi, which were exquisite. If ypu need a wonderful place to visit for the view and food and drink offerings, look no further than Yamashiros. 👍🤙🤗</review>

<Text>We were first down at the outdoor bar for happy hour and the service was outstanding! The bar staff was so genuinely nice and sweet. Service was exceptional and such a fantastic happy hour! Great selection for only $7 for food and drinks on the happy hour menu.
Then we were up in the restaurant for dinner. Waiter was super nice and the food was excellent. I was leary from some of the reviews, but everything was delicious and beautiful.
And of course they have one of the best views in Hollywood.<//Text></record>

Beautiful gardens and friendly staff. Attended a small company party with my wife on a Sunday for brunch. Service was good, but would have been better with two waiters. Food was delicious and drinks were well made.< /Review>

Beautiful place but it took a LONG time for someone to come take our order. Once that was made known to the manager, he really stepped up and we got excellent service after that. The food was freaking amazing so I'll give 5 stars despite the service in case it was just an off day. It happens.</text>

This was a brunch to put all others - to shame! Crab legs, sushi, carved roast beef, Eggs Benedict, french toast! Yum- yum -yum.

Expensive but good, and a very special place for special occasions. We enjoyed our visit, the food was good, the menu variety interesting, the venue a historic and beautiful locale, and the views awesome. There are a lot of good places to eat in LA but few like this one. You'd have to be pretty well off to be a regular, but for a special occasion I think it's the right spot.< /text>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>The view and decor were amazing. I've honestly had better food for less cost, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good or worth it because the scenery is a huge factor.
My main discontent was that we went for the New Year's party and dinner. It definitely felt like they overbooked. It was crowded and impossible to get anywhere (including the bathroom). The party goers and drunks spilled into the dining area regardless of whether or not they were actually dining and would block walkways. Took forever to get drinks from the "open bar" (that was really just the most basic stuff like soda or juice mixed with one hard liquor or beer). Not really worth the price tag for the party wristband since you'd have to have 12+ drinks or really like the entertainment (that was again impossible to get to). The dessert buffet if you were dining basically got trashed by the drunks by 10pm since it was across from one of the bar stations and no one was watching it/keeping track and there was adsolutely no division between it and the party. Coffee was long gone too. We were lucky just to get cookies. Felt sorry for anyone who came after us expecting something.
They were clearly understaffed. It took 45+ minutes for anyone to bring us the check and during that time we totally could have just up and left without paying because people were wandering to and from the party anyway (no one's card was on file), but we have principles and have worked the industry so we just waited.
Again the view and decor were beautiful and probably more picture worthy on a normal day, and the food was great, so I do still highly recommend coming here and would go again... Just not during one of their parties.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1546622001346, 'text': "Yi, thank you for sharing this honest feedback.

Atmosphere is dark and busy but the food and location was great. Great place for celebration or nice date.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Today, we celebrated 40yrs of marriage.  We returned to Yamashiros, the site of our Garden Nuptials in 1979.   We shared our exquisite dining experience with our 4 children who were equally impressed with the serene ambience, excellent cuisine, beautiful skyline & landscapes. We enjoyed perfectly prepared Salmon, Vegetarian delights, Pan Seabass & Ribs!  Our lovely server surprised us with a  scrumptious light "fortune cookie" filled with fruit & whipped cream to honor the celebration! Yamashiros...has sustained the test of TIME.<//Text>

Took my husband here for his birthday and we had the full chef's tasting menu (no wine pairing). It was definitely a meal to remember! The dishes were all unexpected, interesting, and delicious. Service was impeccable. It's a splurge but well worth it. One of my favorites was the cheese course that featured truffle-covered cheese.</review>

The location is on top of hill close to Hollywood sign area, which deserves more stars. The food is so delicious, the sake came in a really cool jar with perfect temperature. My visit was hosted by a DJ which made me feel so special when mixed a Brazilian beat with another song. I choose this place to bring my wife and ask for marriage over there. Sunset and later on all lights from L.A were unforgettable. I still recommending this place to all my travel friends who have at least one night in this city. Oss</Review>< pictures>

First time trying this place.  Omg the food is so good.  Service is fast and friendly.  So glad I live close to this place.  I can order anything on the menu and basically know it will be good.  If you like Chinese food and don't want to drive all the way to the SGV, you should definitely come here.  Easy parking.  Delicious.  Kids-friendly.<//review>

View was amazing and the gardens inside were simply gorgeous. Staff were attentive and friendly, only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the food wasn't mind blowing, which is what you'd expect for the price. I had the glazed cod and it was underwhelming for the price. The mushroom and Cod just didn't work for me, all the flavours overpowered the delicate cod taste and texture and all I could taste was mushroom.

The sushi was lovely and I'm told the seared Ahi Tuna was nice too. Overall a gorgeous place and would definitely come back.</text>< Rating>

<Text>It was a lovely night out with my lady taking us here for our 1 year. It was extremely packed and traffic on the way up, but luckily she had reservations. We were seated within 10 minutes. In the meantime, we walked right across to enjoy the beautiful Japanese garden with ponds in front of a gorgeous view overlooking the Los Angeles cityscape.

Our waiter, Kamarco, was great at getting us started and helped create a flavor I was interested in by mixing two items on the menu. We had a multitude of items to choose from and we started off mixing the Honey Garlic Baked Wings with the Honey Sriracha Shrimp, making it a Honey Sriracha Baked Wings appetizer. We also got Oyster Shooters, expecting fresh Oyster Shells, but were happily surprised with the shot glasses made with a unique oyster concoction. We selected the Green Dragon, the Ninja, and the Samurai roll to follow through. It was all made to perfection.

Although we did experience a problem right as I was about to dig into my first roll, it was handled in the most professional and courteous way you'd expect any high end restaurant to handle it. For that, I will leave out the details and thank the manager Mika for being so welcoming and generous. It was a nice early birthday and an anniversary dinner. That sushi melt in my mouth and I'm definitely going to crave it again. The only thing I wouldn't get again would probably be the Wagyu Beef roll. The truffle oil was so overpowering that it felt like I dipped my steak in soy sauce and salt.

Lastly, the place had a fun history as it was originally built as a house in 1915 and eventually converted into a restaurant. Every Thursday night they also have a Street Food Fair with lunch trucks right next to it so maybe we'll stop by for that next time. Cheers!</Text>< UserId.>

This place is beautiful. You may recognize some of the dining rooms since many movies have been filmed here. A great ambiance and dining experience. The food was nothing great and a bit over priced but I'd still recommend this place for the experience alone.< /Text>

The only reason this place gets four stars instead of five is that they were unable to accommodate the reservation time & were ~45min later than our scheduled time.  Excellent sushi.  The sushi kitchen is a separate kitchen<//text>

Horrible service. Had reservations for 8:15pm was sat down after was a hr. We literally saw them sit down everyone else that came after us before us. The waitress and host were really rude. Said if we didn't like the service just leave. Mauricio the bartender was the only polite person there and apologized for the whole situation. I also tried to put this review on RESY and they denied my post smh.<//review>

We arrived 30min before our booking, traffic was non-existent, and was told to wait in the bar area. After sitting at high table for 25 minutes and asking multiple waitstaff who continually offloaded us to someone else we were finally asked what drinks we wanted.

Ten minutes after our booking time, I ask the Maître d' if our table was ready and she mentioned there were a number of bookings ahead of us waiting to be seated. So I returned to our drinks and continued waiting.

Nearly 20min past our *booking* we were seated and beyond that our experience was pleasant. The sushi was lovely, and fried nigiri was especially fun.

One note: Don't order the giant fortune cookie, unless you are more interested in taking photos of your food than eating it. Not sure why we got it, maybe the novelty, but it was bland and uninteresting.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdwnxhnZgMXLFzYgXZahQO-_IvGcg8XhGKzSPL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-z1qKOV1qCW8JmOuaY6N5hhyebq-jFruQSKAd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXCpXHWjpFVAz372L0vO_DiaJBMuLVavgUR_q2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg1YqbfuPoh0Gw821LEIvtAVSRu8A9UQCEQFuO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

We ordered 3 starters and two plates of sushi - salt and pepper calamari, pork dumplings, crab cakes, California tempura roll, and wagyu beef nigiri. Generally the food was great, but the calamari was battered in something that made it armour-plated and the tempura roll was actually the entire roll, deep fried, which cooked the salmon. It was tasty but lost all of the freshness I was expecting from the roll. $10 for a single bottle of Asahi was also pretty scandalous.
A great experience but very expensive and food not quite on a par with the setting.<//review>< response>

Definitely a good tour spot and restaurant to stop to try sushi while looking over Hollywood. I came here with family who was visiting from out of the country. Great place to visit and it's right next to Hollywood.<//Review>

<review>It was either bad management or server was horrible. Took server 20 mins to take orders then never checked on us again. Asked for a straw never received it. Later the server told us he got a busy night and couldn't handle it. Food was mediocre restaurant was beautiful that's it. First and last time there. Not worth the rave. Either way server received a nice tip for doing nothing. No star period.</review><userid>107989811269551838937< /userid><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Came here for a private event: My friend's baby's 1st birthday! Great space for parties. Plenty of parking in the lot.

M Grill is a terrific Brazilian steakhouse. Nicely designed interiors with trendy decor, but the building itself (exterior) looks really dated. For dining, there is a cool self-serve salad bar with refreshing and delicious fruits, seafood, soup, cold cuts, and veggies. For the main courses, the waiters serve the variety of different meats to your table. It is all you can eat, so enjoy and devour to your heart's content. The meat selections of pork, beef, lamb, chicken, etc. are brought to the table and some are sliced from the hand held skewers. The quality and taste of the meats are excellent. Perfectly cooked to my liking, as well. Filet mignon, parmesan chicken, rack of lamb, top sirloin, smoked sausage, boneless leg of lamb, wagyu beef, beef ribs, & ribeye are just a number of meats I've had from their extensive menu!!

The servers are both friendly and accommodating here!! No complaints!!<//review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Yamashiro means castle in the mountain.

There is a Japanese style buidling
on the Hollywood hills.

Therefore, you can easily see whole
city of Hollywood and Los Angeles
from this restaueant.

Especially, night scenery is really good.

You can choose  assorted Sushi,
Sashimi, Prawn& Scallop, Baby Back Rib,
Salmon etc. from the menu.

Foods are tasty and Scenery is good.

You can see Japanese style garden
in the middle of the restaurant.<//Review>

What a destination spot for a unique dining experience. High atop a hill overlooking the LA skyline, you are transported back to feudal Japan and it does not disappoint. It’s almost Disney-fied, and that’s not a bad thing. Prices are into with most fine dining joints, but not crazy for the whole experience. Highly recommend the crab roll!<//Review>

Amazing ambiance and atmosphere sitting near the garden with live music, almost ruined by a distracted waiter and overcooked food. Will try again since it's such an amazing place and the service was the only issue, would try other menu items as most of what we got was good.<//Review>

This is my first time come to Yamashiro summer farmers market. The traffic in Hollywood is always a nightmare. Parking in the Mosaic church parking lot and take the shuttle is easier than driving up the hill. Shuttle is $5 per person (not per car), round trip. When you enter, you need the wrist band if you want to drink alcohol, if not, there is no entry fee. Live music is amazing and the set up is really "farm theme" which makes the night so chill and enjoyable. There are not so many local farms veggies and fruits, more like a vendors events where you get to buy some food, drinks, candles, clothes, etc., and then you can sit on any outside table enjoy the music and city night view. Love this farmers market event and will defiantly come back again!<//Text>< rating>

Have loved this place forever. It still never gets old after all these years! Fantastic views and fun, energetic vibe for good times, every time. I love to bring friends and family from out of town here, and it’s always a home run. Food, wines and cocktails are all excellent and fairly priced. Really happy to finally live close enough to walk there and enjoy. 🥰 Cheers to another hundred years! 🎉<//text>

If this place isn't on your on your LA eats bucket list then you're doing it wrong. Great food even though the location is attractive enough to sell horrible food. If you've got the time to eat here you won't regret it.</review>

Late night supper was divinely decadent after seeing the American cinematic classic "Breakfast at Tiffany's". Princessa decided to   have  a "Late Nite Supper at Yamashiro's". We dined on Sushi and Salmon and Avocados..oh my! Accompanied with warm Sake and a Shinasa cocktail followed by a dessert of Fried banana in wonton wrapping with strawberry ice cream and creme anglais. Lite fare and totally delicious 😋<//text>

The appetizers, steak-on-skewers, eggrolls, sushis of emperial kind made exclusively for over 250 guests; the Hollywood city night lights; the golden Buddha right on the hillside - UFO-like objects, helicopter, planes, etc are some of the sights at night to see and experience before any other else. The downside, I did not find any service plates to hold and taste the overflowing appetizers - I dont want to pick my food and hold, then shake hands with other guests.< /Review>

You get the picture. Service staff is the best in town (co-owner with chef) is the quintessential front man. He' always smiling, always has a story, makes you feel like his best friend and will always make sure that you're happy.<//text>

This is a historic place that's more than one hundred years old. It has the absolute best views of all of Los Angeles! It's great for an intimate date, or for large groups. Yamashiro in Japanese, translates to mountain palace. And it definitely holds true to its name. The restaurant is Japanese-fusion. It offers some of the best sushi in town, as well as other non-traditional items, like burgers and tacos. The crab cakes are excellent. Have a drink outside next to the pool at the Pagoda bar while you you take in The View!< /Review>

<Text>What a destination spot for a unique dining experience. High atop a hill overlooking the LA skyline, you are transported back to feudal Japan and it does not disappoint. It’s almost Disney-fied, and that’s not a bad thing. Prices are into with most fine dining joints, but not crazy for the whole experience. Highly recommend the crab roll!</Text>< pictures>

We came here for lunch before our movie since we were craving Mediterranean food. The lot was closed when we got here so we had to do street parking. When we walked in they weren't busy so we were good to order. I asked the cashier which dish would be better .. the filet mignon or ground sirloin. She said most people pick the filet mignon so I order that with side of fries. I really enjoy my dish, the fries were seasoned nicely and the filet mignon was amazing.</Text>

Absolutely amazing and authentic Japanese food and atmosphere. We just came from japan in April and couldn’t figure out why it seemed so familiar it turns out the restaurant is an exact replica from Kyoto. Would highly recommend. If you can I’d make a reservation and ask for the garden view.</review>

<Text>Very bad kitchen service for brunch 8/6. My wife’s Hollywood Breakfast came out after she was finished, I was still waiting for my California roll. Same for the table in front of us....the food runners that brought out the food did not even know where to go to. The table next to us waited a long time for their drinks and had to ask many times....it’s not even busy. Came in n at 11am got my food at 12 noon.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

So pretty. Personable, fun staff. The food was delicious and we had to try hard not to scarf it all down too fast. A bit pricey, but it's expected for this location. Worth it and would go again.<//Text>

Now here is a place to go while in LA for the evening. A smart restaurant in an original old (built in 1918) Japanese styled home, built by two rich brothers. The restaurant food is top quality and matches the design of the property fully. However finally the views from the place are just stunning and the lights of LA at night are off the "planet". See the Pics.< /review>

<review>Showed up on time.  Waited a few minutes and then taken to the worst table
in the restaurant.  Was told this was the first time they have set up a table in this space.  We waited and our server was handling the situation well but no other table was available.   We left and never heard from the restaurant.< /review>< Pics>

One of the main places I wanted to try while visiting LA was Yamashiro. It has been on my list for a while. The first night I arrived, I made it my missions to go. It was fairly simple to make reservations online, although they were about 15 minutes behind schedule.

There was a mishap with the seating and I had to wait an additional few minutes, but once seated, the view and ambiance took over. The place is very nice and watching the sun set in the distance is something I’d highly recommend.

To start with, my wife and I ordered the popcorn shrimp. By far one of the best shrimp dishes I’ve had anywhere. I wasn’t really sure what to expect, but it exceeding my expectations. After that I ordered a Malibu sushi roll, which was also one of the best I’ve ever had. Once I was done with my roll, we ordered a Filet Mignon & Pineapple yakitori and a Chicken Negima yakitori. I really like the Filet Mignon, the chicken didn’t really blow me away, but it was still good.

Overall, I would recommend this place for sure. I’m a little sad that I don’t live closer as I could see myself coming here frequently.<//review>

Amazing place. It's expensive but you should expect that. Great view of Los Angeles, with great food selection. They have special events sometimes so make sure you call before you go. The have a nice court in the middle with Japanese styling that is great for pictures. I went at night so not sure about the view during the day</text>

This spot has been here for ages. I grew up in la crescenta and have many fond memories here. This spot is the best for chinese food in lcr for sure. The chajangmyun here is perfectly cooked and the sauce has that perfect balance of sweet with the right amount of veggies.

The champong is delicious here as well and you can get the korean chinese trio, champong chajang and tangsooyuk. So good. Im not sure they deliver but i hope they do in the future.</Text>

It's a few dollars pricier than most but worth it. I had the Yamashiro | Hollywood special and it's enough for 2 people. And they don't charge for extra sauces.

I had amazing brunch celebrating my friend’s bday. The staff was great. Food was amazing and the bottomless mimosas where nothing short of delish! To top it off, the desserts and pastries by Chef Val were divine! I recommend this restaurant for any occasion or night out!<//text>

This place is definitely really expensive, and you do not get very much of a serving. Tjere are definitely other places where you can eat for much cheaper, with the same quality, and bigger portions. This is largely for the "Hollywood hills" experience. The view is pretty cool, however, and if you are able to stay in the hotel/air bnb at this location, you will not be sorry. The view from the rooms are amazing, and the pool is really neat!<//Review>

Upscale place in an amazing building built a century ago in the style of a traditional Japanese temple. Haven't been in the restaurant for several years so can't speak to the current quality of the food, but you know it's $$$. They do an outdoor "market" (street fair) on Thursday evenings in their parking lot with about 20 food booths, alcohol, etc. Great views of Hollywood & LA., live jazz... Nice atmosphere.< /Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>It's not the same as before.... miss the salt plate for one. Is the food good? yes. Are there amazing views? if you're outside (or if you walk around and it's not blocked off from a private party like the last time we went). Service?  Not this time, delayed seating, didn't have enough of the 'new' menu and not so much personal attention. The pricing.... well it's in line for where you are and what you're ordering.  I've only been here a couple times, but hope this recent experience was a fluke and not indicative of a new direction, but is what reflects what would normally be a higher rating.< /text>< Pics>

<review>This spot has been here for ages. I grew up in la crescenta and have many fond memories here. This spot is the best for chinese food in lcr for sure. The chajangmyun here is perfectly cooked and the sauce has that perfect balance of sweet with the right amount of veggies.

The champong is delicious here as well and you can get the korean chinese trio, champong chajang and tangsooyuk. So good. Im not sure they deliver but i hope they do in the future.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bf1f68d9c3e1:0xeb6245d12e254ab4<//GmapID></record>

When we walked in they weren't busy so we were good to order. I asked the cashier which dish would be better .. the filet mignon or ground sirloin. She said most people pick the filet mignon so I order that with side of fries. I really enjoy my dish, the fries were seasoned nicely and the filet mignon was amazing.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Now here is a place to go while in LA for the evening. A smart restaurant in an original old (built in 1918) Japanese styled home, built by two rich brothers. The restaurant food is top quality and matches the design of the property fully. However finally the views from the place are just stunning and the lights of LA at night are off the "planet".

I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life and have seen the Peaks and valleys of Yamashiro. And I am very pleased to say that they are on an upswing. The food is absolutely delicious and the view cannot be beat. If you haven't been please go and if you've been before come back.</text>

The food and the service was A1. And our waiter was so hospitable. His choices off the menu were on point. Would love for him to be our waiter everytime we visit...< /Text>

<review>Came here specifically because we wanted sushi and they offer "dine-in". Waitlist yourself on Yelp first prior to coming. There are four tables outside (four chairs each), they take your temperature prior to seating you. Very clean process.<//review>< rate>

Definitely an LA staple. It’s pricy but worth it. The ambience is out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Sit with views or in the inner courtyard if you want it to be quieter.</text>

20 in our party. Split into two tables in the bar to the right as you enter. Over the next couple of hours, others arrived and a few of the original group were slowly leaving. This was on a Sunday afternoon between 5 and 8 pm.
Overall, the food service was very bad. Our table of 12 ordered at the same time. However, the food arrived sporadically and myself and 2 others received our order so much earlier than the other 9 that we, of course, waited for our friends meals to arrive and all of us would then eat together.
It did Not happen that way.
I do not like Cold Japanese food. But that's what the three who were served so early did.
On the good side, the waitress was nice enough to give us Separate Checks.< /Review>

< review>
My partner and I came to LA for our anniversary and we booked this restaurant in advance solely for the ambiance and the amazing views. We asked them about a week before we arrived for specific accommodations and they said they could not guarantee it but they would try their best, which we completely understood; they are a fairly popular spot and we knew it would be a busy night before we arrived.

When we arrived in LA, we were extremely pleased that they were able to honor our request. The ambiance is as beautiful as is pictured in other posts, especially the seating in the garden area. The location is on a hill, with views overlooking LA, which makes for great photo opportunities.

The food is mediocre and not anything special, and our server was handling a lot of different tables so he forgot our orders twice and we had to remind him after waiting quite a while.

To be honest, I would come here only for the customer service and ambiance and I would recommend it for those who are first-timers to LA, but I believe the food and service has room to improve.< /review>

<review>Great dishes! Only thing I can complain about was the the speed of service & attention to detail. May have been a new server. The food was fabulous, the view is what you are paying for really.

Not a fan of their burger, I was really excited to try.. as well as sesame seeds nearly on every item. But as for the food it was fabulous as well as the drink list, landscaping and architecture.<//review>< Rate>

Try something with a kick and let the flavors excite your culinary senses. The spicy goat pepper crunch roll was life and with each bite I was highly satisfied. The lunch menu is nice and the attentive service staff provide a courteous display of customer service that allows for you to enjoy a business meeting with colleagues. Roll by and try a specialty roll too.</text>

Amazing, hole in the wall sushi spot! Grab a seat at the counter and make sure to order at least one roll off the Fresh from Japan menu on the white board above the chefs. I got the Tahoe roll (with fresh tuna) and Pokémon roll, both phenomenal!! Rolls have 6 generous sized pieces of sushi. Vegetable/shrimp tempura app had the perfect, light crunch. Don't miss out!</text>

This is a beautiful restaurant. The food is delicious. I'm giving it 3 stars because we had a problem with service. Management was very good at resolving it for us. Hopefully that doesn't happen usually.</text>

One of my favorite views in LA, Thursday nights are extremely fun when the farmers market sets up in roadway that leads up to the entrance of Yamashiro. I especially enjoy the vibe on the terrace above the pool where a house dj plays till 10 pm...</text>

Oh My Gosh what a lovely place to enjoy a breath taking scenery and delicious food. Eating and watching a movie in the middle of an Asian court yard was the coolest ever! It was tricky to find the restaurant for us out-of-townees but worth the effort, the drive up the mountain was fun too. Can't wait to visit again soon!</text>

<Review>There was no sidewalk on the way up to the mountain so we walked up the road and got yelled at by some drivers passing by. There was no actual vegan options on the menu but luckily we had called ahead of time for vegan food. One dish was just boiled soft tofu with no seasoning with a spoon, which is great when you just want to eat 50 cents of tofu in one sitting but perhaps not if your bill comes out to over $100. Sushi was good but not for the price. Great scenery though, which is what you’re really paying for.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>At the end of the day, what you're really paying for is the view of the city. We went to dinner at 9:30 that night and did not get our food - 2 sushi rolls, wagyu short ribs, and duck breast - until about 10:20. After shining a flashlight on our food to see what was actually on the plate, I found the wagyu short ribs to be dry and not as melt in your mouth as I would have expected for the price we paid. The duck breast and the sushi rolls were good, but nothing astonishing and nothing that I felt like we would not have been able to get anywhere else. But hey, the view is unbeatable.</Text>< rate>

Went here for dinner as a prelude to going to the Hollywood Bowl.  They have a dine and ride package that includes dinner, plus shuttle to and from the Bowl.  Great idea since you then avoid the hassle of parking, the traffic, and waiting in the parking lot after the concert to be able to get your car out of the lot, since it is staked parking.

But even more importantly, the food here at Yamashiro was amazing!   Service was great.  We will come back here even with out going to the Bowl.

There were 4 us eating.  Two of us had the ribs, which were melt-off-the-bone tender, and the sweet potatoes served with them were yummy too.  The other two in our party had the salmon.  The portions were huge besides the quality being amazing.

I also had a sushi sampler appetizer which was very good.  And molten chocolate cake for dessert.  My husband had a trio of sorbets for dessert that he loved, and he is not even really a sorbet person.

Highly recommend this place!

Oh yeah - the views of L.A. are fabulous too</Review>

<Review>Husband and I had dinner there tonight. Food was good but they brought my food before my husband. Ordered sushi but we had to ask for chopsticks and soy sauce. Nice view of the city though. Staff is very friendly. The only other annoying thing is being blinded by other patrons using flash on their cameras to take pictures of the view.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Can’t not give this historic LA restaurant 5 stars. The view and the building are fantastic. I use to love the food but since the new owners took over in 2016 the food has been lacking. I love this place for a pre Hollywood Bowl drinks, date night, or to take out-of-town guests.< /Text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>2nd time here for Valentine's Day dinner and I am in disbelief that such a high scale restaurant can let their guests down twice during the same time period.
This time though, everything seemed to be going well in the start. We were seated on time and our server was attentive and nice. However, as the night progressed, our service went spiraling downwards. We ordered appetizers, finished and ordered a couple rolls when I informed him we'll order more afterwards. So we finished our rolls and he swings around, grabs the empty plates, our chopsticks and drops the dessert menu in front of us. I mean, without even asking if we were done eating or if we even wanted more food or dessert. Anyways, I stopped and told him that we um. well.. still wanted to eat? He says, "Oh! ok." and grabs the dessert menus and jots down our order. Mind you he already took away our chopsticks when he thought we had finished eating. Also at this point, we had asked for a refill on her Rosé and there was no water left. We waited for our food and obviously we know this might be a while but when the food showed up... we couldn't eat it cause of our lack of chopsticks. We waited several minutes ( Sushi should not be sitting ) and when we finally got our server, we asked him for chopsticks. Several minutes pass, he even passes by us once or twice, but no chopsticks. Several more minutes pass and he sees us just sitting there and realizes the chopstick mishap and finally decides to grab us chopsticks from a different table where no one was sitting. I told him that the food has been sitting there for too long and wanted new ones. He said ok and took the rolls and left when suddenly in a couple minutes, we get "new" rolls. Honestly, we assumed that he put a rush on the order and went along with it. 3/4 into our food, another waiter shows up with the 2 new rolls and asks us if we ordered it. Clearly, the one we were eating was just reheated!!!! We told the gentleman that we ate or are eating those rolls now... We've just about had it with this place now, and just wanted to leave. The server eventually realizes that we aren't comfortable and don't want to be there. After explaining everything to him he says he was thrown a bunch of tables at the last minute and he wasn't equipped to handle it. Whatever. The manager or something ended up taking off to what was equivalent of the last 2 reheated rolls we had or something. And we left. Obviously this is not the experience I wanted to give my date on any day especially on Valentine's day especially a 2nd time.< /text><rate>1</rate><time>1581881373835< /time>< Response>

<review>Group of 5, celebrating a co-worker's 50th birthday.  Will say that the view and the restaurant itself is awesome.  However, the service was extremely poor, the food was overpriced and unimpressive.  I would not recommend this restaurant unless you are going there for a quick drink and an order of sushi.
Someone in our party ordered a dessert to go, we waited for it and was told it had been sent to our table.  When we told the waitress it hadn't, she  rudely looked through our party's bag, expecting to find it.  Turned out it hadn't been delivered.  Should have been comped for the insult but wasn't.  We work for a large entertainment company and we know all about customer service.  Won't be going back.</review>< Pics>

I just had my birthday there today, and it was amazing!! Our waiter was incredibly kind and courteous, and the food was great. There wasn't a very long wait (for the food), and both the interior and the exterior of the restaurant were beautiful. It was my second time going to Yamashiro, and it certainly won't be my last! 😊</Review>

The ride up is a little difficult and could have better signage. But once you get there the views are incredible! The interior is adorable, but make sure you get a seat with a view! The food was delicious but overpriced. The yellowtail and Serrano pepper was phenomenal. And I want at least 12 more of the strawberry filled donuts. Overall enjoyable experience.</review>

<review>Yamashiro is simultaneously a touristy spot, but hidden enough away to be more for locals. The design of the building itself, and its location on the hill overlooking the city is the best part. Good for the right type of date, and a place to snap a photo or two. The food itself wasn't all that impressive, there's much better sushi at Katsuya or Sugar Fish, which id recommend instead.< /review><Response>{'time': 1542164615909, 'text': "Shane, thank you for your honest feedback.

I know everyone bows down to Yamashiro but except for the view I had a terrible experience. Started with the guy at the entrance not wanting to let me and my girlfriend in (we had to say 3 times we had a reservation), then a valet guy pulled behind our car and started flashing the lights although we were going to the valet. In the restaurant our server was 100% on autopilot, food took incredible long (although the restaurant was sort of empty) and it was nothing out of this world at all for the price and time and
at the end the valet treated us like we were leaving at 2am although it was 10pm and I tipped $5 over a $8 fee. So.... it's a nay for me.</review>

We ordered the salt & pepper chicken wings, Mongolian beef and the shrimp chow mein. Everything was good! We will definitely be ordering from here from now on! No need to drive down to National City for good Chinese.< /review>

If you like Japanese Food and some of the best views of Los Angeles then look no further. The place is huge and there is something for everyone. From the bar inside with the great views of Hollywood, to the seasonal outdoor Pagoda bar, and the main restaurant this place has it all. The food is good too. Highly recommend the Himalayan Steak served on a Himalayan salt rock.</review>

The food here is decent. Not great. But it is good. Why five stars? Because the reason to go is for the view of the city. AMAZING! (In some ways better than Griffith Observatory). But the interior is insanely beautiful too. If you can get a table by the koi pond, do it.< /text>

Visiting all the way from Salt Lake City, I was looking for a great Japanese place to get some seafood, I got their sushi and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing, they have a nice sitting area on the inside patio that features a display of a tiny Japanese forest, on the outside the views of the city of Los Angeles  are great as well.</Text>

<review>I ate it how the chef recommended it be cooked (which I think was medium). I added a bibb salad (lettuce mixed with vinagrette, shaved carrots and radishes) and a side of vegetables as the meat comes with some vegetables but not a lot!< /review></record></dataset><record>

The food has gotten so much better with the new management! Always a great view and terrific place to take out-of-towners.  Even the seating without the view is lovely, with the indoor garden.  The Yamashiro Night Market on Thursday nights in the spring & summer is a special treat!< /Review>

<resp>None< /resp><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Best view! Good food!

If you go there on a Thursday late afternoon, you'll get to see the Hollywood Night Market as well.  You'll have an option to buy food from the market or inside from the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is sitting at a higher level than where the market is and on the top of the Hollywood Hills that gives clear views of downtown LA and Century City.

You can go there either by car, a shuttle bus and also walk.  Parking is hard to find and it's not easy to drive in such a narrow winding road.  The shuttle comes from Hollywood and La Brea where the Mosaic Church is which takes forever although it's a short walk from there.  If you decide to walk from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, then go north on  Orange st from Hollywood Blvd, cross the street at Frankin, and go left.  When you see the sign, walk up the street.  It's a steep slope and you'll feel  out of breath in that 10 min walk.<//Review>< rate>

Absolutely incredible views paired with delicious Japanese cuisine combine to form one of the "must experience" resutrants in the greater Los Angeles area. That said it's expensive, so bring your wallet.< /text>

It's not what it used to be. I asked for medium rare and got well done,  and then the replacement steak was  medium at best, no where near medium rare. The food is only half decent, not worth the price. the service was the only thing good.< /review>

I know everyone bows down to Yamashiro but except for the view I had a terrible experience. Started with the guy at the entrance not wanting to let me and my girlfriend in (we had to say 3 times we had a reservation), then a valet guy pulled behind our car and started flashing the lights although we were going to the valet. In the restaurant our server was 100% on autopilot, food took incredible long (although the restaurant was sort of empty) and it was nothing out of this world at all for the price and time and
at the end the valet treated us like we were leaving at 2am although it was 10pm and I tipped $5 over a $8 fee. So.... it's a nay for me.<//text>

The food here is decent. Not great. But it is good. Why five stars? Because the reason to go is for the view of the city. AMAZING! (In some ways better than Griffith Observatory). But the interior is insanely beautiful too. If you can get a table by the koi pond, do it.< /text>

Came here for my birthday wanted to go to a nice place. First the host forgot to seat us down. Once we finally got seated food was good waiter was suppose to bring out cake with pyro like everyone else received and the end of our meal, but don’t know why I got an old cake with a 1 cent candle. Thank you for the terrible experience will NEVER RETURN DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR BIRTHDAYS this place is for large gatherings not an intimate place.< /Text>

<name>Sophie Rappé</name><Text>This place used to be great. Under new ownership now and they changed the menu, removing most of their best, "signature" items. Drinks tasted bland and watered down. They used to have great food and service with a great view. Now the food is mediocre, and the only reason to go there is for the view. During our last visit, the manager came over to "check in" and introduce himself, then walked away before any of us get a word in.</Text><rate>2</rate>< gmap_id>

< review>
Definitely come here for the view atop the Hollywood hills. The restaurant is elegant and beautiful inside and out, with a Japanese garden and Buddha statue in front of this secluded pagoda. However, the food itself doesn't match the Japanese setting. I suppose Japanese-American would be one way to describe it, but even that would be overqualifying the food. Especially for what you'll be paying? You're not going to be paying for the quality of the food. You'll be paying for the spectacular view as well as quality service. Would come back the next time I'm in town, but I'd probably only order a drink.<//review>

<review>Beautiful location, it's the Kill Bill film set and a Hollywood landmark. However, the service killed our experience. Our server, Robert was barely cut out to handle a TGIFs on a Monday. It was our wedding anniversary and the experience at the restaurant ruined our evening. The lack of a fine dining experience makes the food over priced. They really need to overhaul their staff to justify those prices. The food was okay. They overcooked my 'Wagu' burger since Robert never asked how I wanted it cooked. When he finally came back past, I stopped him to ask how they were cooking my burger, he said, I dont know, it's already in. He also managed to only serve me one beer throughout my entire dinner and never asked if we wanted more drinks. Avoid unless you want to take selfies there, I only gave it 3 stars for the architecture.<//review>< resp>

< Review>
Yamashiro | Hollywood  is easily one of my favorite sushi restaurants in LA. The impeccable quality of the fish is always consistent, and you really can't beat the price for their sashimi lunch or even their sashimi deluxe (if you're extra hungry). Simply put, the fish is always fresh and delicious.<//Review>

Went here with 3 others for a dinner. Ended up getting some great sushi (my favorite being the Spicy Salmon & Scallop Crispy Rice Sushi) and 2 others ordered the Himalayan Salt Plate which I got to sneak a taste of and it was amazing! We also splurged and shared a giant fortune cookie dessert. Overall the surroundings were gorgeous and I would highly recommend this as a spot for a special dinner celebration.</Text>

On Saturdays we use a temp receptionist  for answer calls. She received your call and checked the lost and found. She noticed a jacket but it turned out not to be the lost jacket you were looking for.  in the future we will do a better job in getting the description of the jacket and visual ID before sending confirmation. in the meantime, we are looking to see if the lost jacket was found or stolen.

Horrid service. Food is soso/average at best. View is amazing and the building is beautiful. However the prices do not equate the quality of service or food. I ate there for a special night and had to ask for water refills multiple times; the sake we ordered came after all the dishes arrived about an hour into the meal. I asked three people including our waitress where the sake was and always got an “it’s coming”. And the tempura was cold.
Asked for a manager and left voicemails; no response or call backs. No attempt to make it right.
Avoid this terribly run place. Sad - with new management it is a gorgeous setting.</Review>

<text>It took about 45 minutes until I get my order. The quality of the food is just as good as a normal place and there is nothing special about the dishes. Our server was unprofessional, did not have a smile on, and gave us a bit of an attotitude when he came to our table for the second time to get our order and we weren't ready. Sad thing they charge 20% gratitude on your bill unless I would not have paid more than 10% to him. The parking is valet only and you have to pay $10. However the view from up there is very nice and worth one time visit.< /text>< pics>

This should have been 4 or 5 stars but the food let it down - its a shame as I had eaten here a few years ago and found the food to be excellent but when I visited recently with family the food was mediocre - the duck was bland. The ribs were decent and my niece enjoyed the rolls - but for $230 for a meal for 4 with only 2 starters and 1 drink each we were a little disappointed. Obviously you cannot beat the setting, atmosphere, surrounding and views - they are all excellent and well worth a visit just for that. The service was also fantastic. But some of the mains as I said could have been better for the money we were spending....<//Text>

The Himalayan salt plate was MMMMM. The server comes and crushes the garlic onto the 400 degree plate and shows you how to cook the wagyu. Cooking it with the garlic adds more flavor to the meat. You can cook the salad on the plate too and it tastes pretty good! I really enjoyed it! We got the smore brownies for dessert and it was pretty good too! Never skip dessert here.

It is pretty darn pricey so it is best saved for special occasions< /Review>

I've lived in LA for more than 20 years and this is the nicest restaurant I've ever been to. Save it for a special occasion, worth it. Every detail about this place is gorgeous and crafted. The floors, gardens, even handles are gorgeous. A+ for ambiance and decor. I believe it was someone's old mansion. The views.... Wow. You literally see the whole city from your seat. It's breathtaking

The food was good. Pricey but that's what fine dining is

They changed ownership and the food quality just went down so bad. I recently went there to celebrate my birthday, the view is  breathtaking but that is about it. I am very disappointed in the food . Most likely I will not come back again.< /text>

<Review>I visited the restaurant for dinner, based on the numerous reviews I’ve read.
Unfortunately I was up for a huge disappointment.
The only reason I gave 2 stars and not Zero is due to the view the place has and the fact that the staff were good and friendly.
As regarding the food, we have ordered spring rolls which we couldn’t  eat as it was extremely oily.
We ordered the Miso soup which was so average , for the main course we ordered 2 orders (both are fish), and still  they were very average, even the sushi we ordered, there were nothing special nor tasty.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Can't get any better. Best Chinese food in Los Angeles County. Clean, fresh and tasty. We moved out of Los Angeles and keep going there to Lucky's. Their broccoli beef, orange chicken and kao pao are the best! Will go back again and again and again!</Text>

Edit!!

March 2017: I had a very chaotic waitress who seemed to had lost our bank card for a moment after not returning it for good 20 minutes. The food was good but nothing so special. The spring rolls and the sushi rolls were very boring compared to last time I've been here.
Not sure if I'll go to this place again in the near future<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>113587282789391940219<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

I got two slices and tried cutting it with the butter knife but the meat was tough so I asked the waiter for a steak knife. I NEVER RECIEVED A STEAK KNIFE. I walked back to the buffet a can't get any food because there were NO CLEAN PLATES. I wait a few minutes and someone brings out wet plates. Can't eat the bacon it looks overcooked. I see crab legs with no melted butter no thank you, I end up eating cupcakes, deviled eggs, and cold shrimp not quite the brunch I had in mind. I was disappointed with the experience.<//text><user_name>DeAlphria Christina< /user_name></record>

But if you're around and you're looking for an amazing view and a beautiful place to have a meal do not hesitate!</text>

Beautiful restaurant with stunning views of LA, beautiful gardens and multiple indoor/outdoor seating areas. Great place for special occasions or for impressing out of town guests. Valet Parking only. Note that this spot is only open for dinner, except on Sundays, when they are now open for both dinner and brunch.< /review>

<Review>Yamashiro is historical & a must see place @ least 1x. There is a lovely exterior garden featuring a 600 year old Japanese Pagoda & an enormous Buddha. The views are stunning. There is an interior garden as well featuring a koi pond. There's a great bar with spectacular views. The food is hit & miss. The restaurant underwent a change of ownership less then a year ago so it'll be interesting to see if the food improves. Service is always excellent.<//Review>< Time>

I always love coming to this restaurant.  The food is great if you love Sushi and the view is one of a kind overlooking all of Hollywood and Los Angeles.  If you're looking to take a date somewhere nice then this is the place to go to at least once.  You're date will enjoy it guaranteed.<//text>

<Review>There is nothing like the atmosphere at Yamashiro. Situated high up on a hill, there is a panoramic view of LA from every window of the restaurant. The food was carefully prepared and the menu is unique. This would be an excellent location to bring a date!< /Review>< pics>

I had an amazing omakase experience here.  The fish here is fresh, slightly dressed with the right amount of condiment like yuzu, sea salt, citrus, etc etc.  The chef was extremely personable and skilled.  The ambiance is just as good as the food.  I am so happy that there is finally a legit sushi spot in ktown!  Also the price for omakase cannot be beat!<//Text>

<Review>Upon the great view the Japanese architecture you are clearly questioning the Buddha​ next to a bar. As we are seated the hilariously dirty menus that I did not even want to touch, at least the tables where beautiful in a ox blood finish. The food options are scarce and super over priced for what you get targeting larger groups with the menu having little Japanese choice options was honestly disappointed although yes what food we did order came out just good although nothing worth coming back. Seriously though don't eat at a Japanese restaurant that offers burgers and charges you $10 for valet parking  even though I parked the car myself because my car doesn't come with power steering. Overall the menu needs refinement while the restaurant needs to Target food that other places don't have or can make better especially with that price premium.</Review>< Pics>

I was so impressed by the reviews online and the views of the place. We ate here on a Tuesday night and it was still very busy! Seems like a place that would be busy every night though. We requested a table facing the pool pagoda and the city. Absolutely beautiful views, but even better outside on their walking trail. The service overall was just okay. Food took about 45 minutes and my second cocktail that I ordered never even came, yet we were billed for it. Our server however was nice enough to remove it from the bill and still bring it over to me. The ambiance was nice too, but I was surprisingly surprised by the attire of the guests. To me, this place looks like a high end dressy dinner. It was pretty half and half for those that did dress up and those that just wore jeans and a tshirt. Not a big deal to me, I could care less but I was a little shocked by that. Even with the moderate service, this is still a place I would recommend simply because of the views. Side note, do not walk here ladies. Take an Uber or Drive. There is a ridiculous hill leading up to it.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Warning to all photographers! I photographed a wedding there Feb 9, 2013. I was told that I would be served dinner after the guests were served. Not a problem, that is how it should be. BUT, they waited so long to serve me my dinner that the events of the night started up again and I had no time to get away. So in short, if you are the hired photographer, do not expect to be served dinner. Money in their pocket. The family was charged for the meal but you don't get it and you go home hungry!

Will I shoot here again? I doubt it!!!<//Text>< Pics>

We thought it would be a Japanese restaurant but it was more like modern American and Asian fusion. The food wasn't impressive so you are actually paying for the view. Recommend for people who care the view a bit more than the taste of the food.< /Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Yamashiro is a beautiful restaurant both inside and out along with a spectacular food - even though the food isn't as good as the looks.

I had the 'Darth Vader' roll which is a black rice roll which looked cool but the taste was fairly normal.  The crunchy rice was probably a better bet.  The drinks too were a little shaky.  The saketini was a little light while another spicier concoction was too spicy.  My friend had a meat and potatoes dish that looked cool as well but the end result was fairly bland.

For a romantic evening, it's a definite recommendation.  Be sure to get a window view to see all of LA as you can walk around the interior whenever you want.  Parking-wise, there is a valet service as you come up the hill next to the Magic Castle.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<rating>4< /rating><review>YAMASHIRO HOLLYWOOD
Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument (LAHCM) #921

Yamashiro ("Mountain Palace" in Japanese) is a replica of a palace in Japan's Yamashiro province mountains near Kyoto and was completed in 1914.

Originally built by the Bernheimer Brothers as a mansion to house their Asian treasures, the history of Yamashiro Hollywood includes serving as the headquarters of the ultra-exclusive 400 Club during the Hollywood Golden Age in the late 1920's and a boys' military school during WW2.

Gorgeous restaurant but quite a trek to get to.  Great photo ops though both for the Japanese palace and the LA city view.<//review>< Pictures>

WONDERFUL RESTAURANT   After reading some of the reviews I had mixed feelings about 7 people having dinner there to celebrate birthdays.
We had a marvelous experience, the waitress; Danielle; was the best!
The food was really good, the atmosphere is second to none and the service from the beginning to the valet was A1.  We will return.</Text>

Amazing View, You feel like you've stepped in another realm of Japanese Elegance.

Other than the view---Food was OK. Like Sushi from a nearby Japanese restaurant chain store. Not fresh, Nothing amazing or extraordinary to say the least.</review>

<text>While the food is first rate and the views are amazing, what struck me this time i visited was how great the people watching was. Chalk it up to the long, slow sunsets of summer or to the Thursday farmers' market, or maybe to the fact that 2/3rds of LA seems to make a living via instagram, but whatever it was, I'd go back just to watch Hollywood parade through. Assuming, of course, they feed me sushi, sake and other tasty treats while i watch.</text><GmapID>0x80c2bf1f68d9c3e1:0xeb6245d12e254ab4</GmapID></record>

A bit too pricey for the food & the quality of the service - the place is classy but not the dishes. But I guess it's worth to try as the view is amazing as well as the building.</Text>

<Review>I have to say that this restuarant is no longer one of the best in Los Angeles. It has changed since the late 90's and has definitley gone down in value. The grounds/garden was unkept, sections closed off, and looked dry and like it needed more watering. The food is mediocre compared to what it use to be and for the price the portions are small and I know you can get better food from a lot of other places in Los Angeles! I visited this restuarant on March 29, 2019. It was my Birthday Dinner, and our party of 9 people, 2 which were a toddler and a baby whom did not order their own plate because they were sharing with their parents, So Only 7 adults ordered their own plates and the bill was just shy of $800!!!! My son explained to the waiter that it was my Birthday yet no one ever came back to sing Happy Birthday to me, yet another patron dining here on their Birthday was sung Happy Birthday to! Not to mention, the food was not good at all! The Salmon was excessively salty, the cris-cut fries or whatever those little potato things that came with the rib plate are were stale and tasted terrible!, the server never asked us if we wanted a refill so when my son asked to refill his regular lemonade the waiter told him he would need to purchase another drink and there was No refills on any of the drinks, not even Soft Drinks! Also the server rushed us because we were one of the last 2 customers In the restaurant. On top of all that, the gratuity was included which came out to be 165 bucks and in all honesty I don't think our server deserved more than 20 bucks! We all ended up leaving very dissatisfied and some, like myself, still hungry because I could barely eat the Salty Salmon I ordered. I will never recommend this restaurant again like I use to in the past. I honestly believe we could have gotten bigger portions, better service, FREE refills on our drinks, not been rushed, and the staff not forgotten to sing Happy Birthday to me if we had eaten at Norm's! Oh, and if we had eaten at Norm's we could have saved 650 bucks too!!! I do not recommend Yamashiro's unless u are going there just for the view!<//Review>< pictures>

Since new ownership menu has taken a serious downgrade. Food is cooked well, but for a place with mandatory valet you expect something nicer. Slowly turning into your casual eatery than a special occasion spot.< /text>

We got the pink salt plate,  it was z great experience and quite savory. The salmon skin was super flavorful along with the vegetable sauté. The calamari came very fast and tasted fresh. Lastly for dessert the molten cake melts in your mouth, while the smores just makes you feel like you are camping</Text>

<review>Amazing food & aesthetics, but quite expensive. The waitress also took it upon herself to judge most of the party as drunk when they weren't which really ruined the night. Half a star off for each of these issues. Had to order duck when they ran out of ribs too :/</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Local landmark, amazing views of Hollywood, can see ocean on clear day. Ambiance is second to none, food is great, not inexpensive but you get what you pay for. Great place to impress a date.</text>

Slow service, smelly venue, good food.

When I order three champagnes and two Pinot Noirs I expect champagne, not Prosecco.

We got to our table late, the service while charming was slow and though the views where amazing the smell of burning fat was not encouraging. The food, when it arrived, was mostly excellent, but I was glad to get out of there. Big, kitsch, touristy, worth a miss.</text>

Very nice and friendly, beautiful garden and view of the city. Lobster and Shrimp entrees were delicious! Made reservations for a birthday, i didnt even have to remind them about dessert at the end, they brought it out. Cant wait to go again.< /Text>

The atmosphere was nice, if a very Californian take on Japanese. Our waitress was an absolute doll and the food was lovely.  The (Yuzu?) oil they drizzled on my sashimi left an odd odor to it but it was tasty.  The seared ahi was absolutely worth while.  My dinner companion had chicken and ribs (app and main) and she loved it. Dessert was tasty, if sweeter than either of us expected.  As a once in a while nice evening out?  Well worth it.<//text>

Amazing food & aesthetics, but quite expensive. The waitress also took it upon herself to judge most of the party as drunk when they weren't which really ruined the night. Half a star off for each of these issues. Had to order duck when they ran out of ribs too :/< /Text>

<Review>If it wasn't for the amazing view and Sushi this place would have been a complete bust. Everything is far more expensive than it should be for not only the portion size but even quality of food. Service was mediocre even after making note this was for a birthday dinner. First table was rocking back and forth and recieved slight attitude for asking to be relocated to the garden. Second server in the garden lost interest is us when we didn't show absolute praise with the food. Unfortunately the manager(assumed) didn't stop by again after we had been served or I would have expressed my discontent then.

I was excited to possibly try the Wagyu but after the pork spring rolls were served we held back from ordering entrees. They were dry and not seasoned well at all. Mountain Palace sampler was a repeat disappointment unfortunately and the portion sizes for both considering everything was stale and tasteless was an insult to injury. The sushi was very good in comparison but nothing better than I've had at other establishments nationwide for less.

If you're going to charge the customer for experience and landscape view alone I would shut down the restaurant and turn the facility into a Japanese museum. The atmosphere, view, and decor are amazing but the food was anything but that.<//Review><Date>1528605141777</Date>< Name>

My family and I used to go every year for my mother's birthday to Yamashiro's. My mom loved the traditional Japanese style and dress of the restaurant and the waitresses. The old menu was authentic Japanese cuisine mixed with a touch of modern and was absolutely delicious. The new style and menu is more Americanized and we weren't impressed.  Plus when you ask your waitress specific food questions and she stares at you like a deer in headlights that simply memorized the menu, it makes you wonder.. it was nice to venture out to Yamashiro's since it had been a few years since we all could get together and take my mom out for her birthday, but she said she wouldn't want to go back anymore. She prefered the old Yamashiro's restaurant.</Review>

Terrible SERVICE: very slow, leave used plates for a long time, do no fill up your water glass, do not offer more drinks. Very disappointing. The food is just ok but not great. Waiters lack training or poor management. Overpriced. The only plus: the view. Many better places in LA.</Text>

The food was the delicious. The drinks hit the spot and the service was tremendous. Only negative is that the air conditioner wasn't working and it was hot and uncomfortable.< /Text>

<Review>Filet mignon was cooked perfectly, but the service was horrible.  I was ignored at the bar while waiting for my reservation. The server was a novice for our large party.  He forgot who ordered what, he forgot to bring drinks.  Tip was uncluded, because of the size of our party (11 people) but his bill could have been much higher if he came back for drink orders.  I won't be back.  I can have a great steak anywhere in LA.  Not even the view is worth another visit.< /Review><rating>2< /rating><username>Dave Sanchez<//username><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great views, great service, great food, but be aware the sushi menu is a bit more limited than most other places.  Although, they are willing to go off menu if they have what they need to make it.< /Review>

Service is always great.
Food is amazing
Their crab cakes are delicious with the citrus sauce(yummm!!!)
Their California roll, very delicious.
And their Himalayan salt steak with the lobster tail, absolut heaven!!!
(the one thing I didn't like, was their 2x baked potatoes. I'm not a fan of the overpowering ingredient, which is either horseradish or dijon mustard)</Text>

Filet mignon was cooked perfectly, but the service was horrible.  I was ignored at the bar while waiting for my reservation. The server was a novice for our large party.  He forgot who ordered what, he forgot to bring drinks.  Tip was uncluded, because of the size of our party (11 people) but his bill could have been much higher if he came back for drink orders.  I won't be back.  I can have a great steak anywhere in LA.  Not even the view is worth another visit.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I held off on writing this review because I wanted to give both the restaurant and the valet time to resolve this issue without making a big deal.

On May 12th, I went to Yamashiro to have dinner where it is Valet Parking Only (Curbstand). After dinner the valet returned my car damaged estimated $6,000 worth of damage. I noticed immediately and valet and the restaurant manager assured me that they would take care of it and get it fixed so I filled out the standard claims form and left with proof of the incident.

Fast forward to today. Restaurant and valet and both have denied my claim and refused to pay for damages to my car.

Food was definitely not worth the $1000 deductible, I now have to pay for out of pocket with my own insurance. I will edit my review if either company makes this right.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Incredible view without the noises of LA. Arrive early and spend some time outside along the paths before entering. The food was exquisite, with the two fish dishes we ordered, salmon entree and salmon sushi with pistachios being our favorite. Our Crisscut fries starter were cooked to perfection (how do they do this?) with ranch dressing and Japanese basil. The mixed drinks were standard LA price and some of the best I've ever had for $12. We came in early November, so the seasonal desert of pumpkin creme brulee piqued our interest. A delicious compliment to our other more sweet desert, S'Mores Fudge Brownie. Don't come here simply to eat. Come for the ambiance. Take your time to enjoy the food while looking over LA.</review>< gmapID>

<text>Racist host and staff. Over priced. And over hyped . kind of a panda express on top of a hill. Witch only part of the restaurant shares a good view.

The scenery only good. The price is very expensive and it tastes terrible. Maybe it was the intern in charge of the kitchen.
Please, valet parking and only take pictures.
Because this is not restaurant, may be tourist attraction.<//review>

Reservations (-1 star) – This place has a policy that requires you to make dining reservations by placing a credit card on file for large parties of 6 or more. I am not a big fan of this practice and regardless if you book through Open Table or make a phone reservation they require it. They do have in their fine print that last minute cancellations/no shows may lead in a charge…

Valet (-1 star) - It’s mandatory and its $9. They were extremely nice BUT if you are leaving with a large party it may take a while to get everyone’s car. The other alternative is to park in the residential areas and hike, but its Hollywood and signs are weird so I wouldn’t risk it.

Location (+1 star)- Getting here is kind of tricky and it’s certainly away from the busy Hollywood streets. When you arrive you really do feel like you are transported into a different era. It’s truly a grandiose compound!

Views (+2 stars) - The venue is LOVELY. I mean decadent with a garden and ornate décor. The views overlooking LA is breathtaking especially at night when it seems like the whole city is twinkling. There are TONS of great photo ops here for ppl who love to take picks (both in the restaurant and around).

Food (+1 star) - Pricey yet delicious! I went with an indistinct sushi roll which was very tasty. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meals. It certainly carters to a diverse taste which offer loads to choose from depending on your taste.< /Text>

<text>Darth Vader roll.  That's all you should have to hear to be convinced that this place is awesome.  The Kobe Beef on the Himilayan Salt plate is Oh Dear God Delicious.  I came for a Friendiversary and felt so spoiled.  The view is fantastic.

< Review>
I dont understand how you can have a $80 meal and still be hungry when your finished.  If you are going to be an expensive option, you should at least make your patrons full.  I had chicken teriyaki and the chicken was bland and they give you about 4 ounces of sauce.<//Review>

My wife took me there for our first date ( my 21st b-day) back in 1987. I was completly blown away!!! The atmostphere is so awesome it's very intimidating. The waiter took our entire order and did not write a thing down??? Everything was on the mark! Candlelit tables, very low light & romantic☺. Overlooking all of Hollywood...like i said; Intimidating!! Want to stain her brain forever with a memory that should be everyone's FIRST date.....this is it! Go! Johnny Pantano 4/27/16.< /review>

FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS ITS BEEN ABOSULETLY HORRIBLE...SERVICE AWFUL, ALL THE OLD STAFF ARE GONE. THE FOOD IS RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED AND TERRIBLE, THE MENU IS LIKE SOMETHING FROM OUTBACK INSTEAD OF JAPANESE!!!.A REAL DISASTER AFTER COMING HERE FOR 40 YEARS.  GLOVERS YOU SUCK!!!!HOLLYWOOD WONT COME BACK WITH YOUR TERRIBLE "CALIFORNIA CUISUNE "  Just heard you sold Glover. THATS GREAT NEWS.MAYBE THE NEW OWNERS WILL RETURN IT TO WHAT IT ONCE WAS.<//text>

<review>first year anniversary!!  I contact reservations to request date, time and table, they explain they cant reserve specific table. So I mention the occasion and they say if the table is available they will certainly seat us there. We arrive just early to a vacant hostess station, when hostess arrives she is curt and unfriendly i give our name and res. info she cant find it then does I mention the request for table  - we end up at a table across from window tables with at least two window tables available and a few better wall tables as well. this is not what was promised and i certainly dont like an unfriendly hostess who didnt care to provide what was requested when available ever but especially when is a special date and Im paying top dollar!! we went on to enjoy our evening cause that what we do but the seating and hostess certainly didnt help our special evening - oh food was great - service was slow disorganized friendly.

Two of my friends and I decided to go to somewhere fancy shmancy the last we can actually meet up with each other before going back to school. When we go here, we were serious stunned by the view of the restaurant because you can see the entire city. You can also see a big sign that says trailer park too loool. There's also a small Japanese "garden" in the middle of the restaurant which is nice too.
Anyways the service was very good and the food was decent. It didn't taste amazing, but it was definitely better than any other Japanese restaurant I have been to.
We ordered two orders of sashimi, an order of poke, and an order of hamachi. The sashimi was very meaty and tasted fresh. The yellowtail was all right ... Didn't know why it tasted warm and that kinda bothered me. But oh man the poke was like the best I have ever had. Seriously if I were to come back ... I would definitely order a lot of the poke!  Overall the experience was awesome ! And this place is definitely worth a try if you're taking someone out on a date or something<//Text>

When we go here, we were serious stunned by the view of the restaurant because you can see the entire city. You can also see a big sign that says trailer park too loool. There's also a small Japanese "garden" in the middle of the restaurant which is nice too.
Anyways the service was very good and the food was decent. It didn't taste amazing, but it was definitely better than any other Japanese restaurant I have been to.
We ordered two orders of sashimi, an order of poke, and an order of hamachi. The sashimi was very meaty and tasted fresh. The yellowtail was all right ... Didn't know why it tasted warm and that kinda bothered me. But oh man the poke was like the best I have ever had. Seriously if I were to come back ... I would definitely order a lot of the poke!  Overall the experience was awesome ! And this place is definitely worth a try if you're taking someone out on a date or something</Text>< Pics>

Should receive only 2 or 3 stars... but, the view and building are awesome.

<review>We had a wonderful experience.  Evan our waiter, was fantastic, professional, friendly and extremely helpful.  He made our family night out great. Thank you Evan.
Many thanks also to the valet parking service,  Roger and his crew were friendly, courteous and efficient.
We certainly be back soon.</review><user_name>gustavo garcia</user_name>< Response>

Becuase the parking lot is really small. To me being obligated to park using the valet is something that you should have the choice to use it or not, $8 and of course you have to pay the guys to bring your car and I didn't like the way he drove it.</text>< pictures>

Протеворечивое впечатление. Сам ресторан очень красивый. Но мы бронировали места, а потом пол часа ждали пока нас посадят, а потом ещё минут 40, пока принесут роллы.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Scenery and buildings! !!

I went with a Japanese group related to work.
This restaurant, which was chosen by Mr. Tuacon, who I can rely on, was very disappointing.
I feel sorry for Mr. Tourcon ...

It was a buffet style due to the large number of people, but there were only 4 types of dishes.
All of them seem to have been made.
I was impressed with the thick noodle fried noodles (like / without ingredients) that seems to be Chinese food lol
The rest is a leaf-only salad (like), fried food (contents unknown), and roast beef (like).
I wish I had one of the California rolls ...
I thought it would have been better to go to Yoshinoya for the seeds of the story.
But it was fun because I ate with everyone!
I felt "who to eat!" Rather than "what to eat?"!

I am Japanese.
I went here with my workmates. It was a buffet, because we'er many people group.
The food was only 4 kind of food !!! Moreover, it was not Japanese food and it looked bad. If you want to eat Japanese food, i recommend go to YOSHINOYA. Hahaha

(Original)
景色と建物サイコーー！！

仕事関係の日本人グループで行きました。
頼れるツアコンさんが選んでくれたこのレストランは、とても期待はずれでした。
ツアコンさんが気の毒になってしまった……

大人数のためビュッフェ形式でしたが、でてきた料理はわずか4種類。
どれも作り置きされたようなものばかり。
中華料理でありそうな太麺の焼きそば（のようなもの/具なし）が印象的でした笑
あとは葉っぱのみのサラダ（のようなもの）、揚げ物（中身は不明）、ローストビーフ（のようなもの）。
カリフォルニアロールの１つでもあれば良かったんですが…
話のタネに吉牛行った方が良かったんじゃ…と思った。
でもみんなと食べたので楽しかったです！
「何を食べるか？」よりも、「誰と食べるか！」を身をもって感じました！

(Translated by Google) For food, then you don't want to come, because when we come here, the food is just like it. Instead, come for the location and service of the restaurant. No one has rebuked this. Looking out from the restaurant's platform, the city has a superb view and the waiters are attentive, friendly and fast.

(Original)
為了食物的話，那你就不要來了，因為我們來這裏的的時候，食物一般般。相反，為餐廳的位置和服務而來吧。這點沒有人斥責。從餐廳的平台往外看，城市的景色超贊，服務員細心、友好而且快速。</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The restaurant is visually a dream, it looks incredibly beautiful, looks very authentic and looks like the house comes from a different time. The view over LA is gigantic!

The food was very tasty and the menu was a bit overwhelming. We tried blibd on it and it was very good and fresh. The price was ok for sushi.

Unfortunately, the service for such a restaurant was not that great. Everyone was very friendly but you had to wait a long time, we were sometimes forgotten and the table was dirty, the menus were spilled, sticky and partly wet. That doesn't really fit with the rest.

(Original)
Das Restaurant ist optisch ein Traum, es sieht unglaublich schön aus, wirkt sehr authentisch und es wirkt als stamme das Haus aus einer anderen Zeit. Der Blick über LA ist gigantisch!

Das Essen war sehr lecker wobei die Speisekarte uns etwas überforderte. Wir haben blibd drauflos probiert und es war sehr gut und frisch. Der Preis war ok für Sushi.

Leider war die Bedienung für so ein Restaurant nicht ganz so toll. Zwar waren alle sehr freundlich aber man musste recht lange warten, wir wurden teils vergessen und der Tisch war schmutzig, die Speisekarten vollgekleckert, klebrig und zum teil nass. Das passt so gar nicht zum Rest.</Text>< UserId.>
