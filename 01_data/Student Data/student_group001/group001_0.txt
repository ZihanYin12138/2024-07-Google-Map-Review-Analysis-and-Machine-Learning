Fabulous place with very friendly customer service. First time here today and found out they have a lots of drink I like. The lady named Cici helped me with my order. Super friendly customer service and helped me figure out what dink I would like the best. Got a orea shack and mango drink, and some other milk tea drinks, they all really fresh and delicious. Personal I recommend their fruit tea and chocolate egg puff. Highly recommended this location and will definitely come back again!<//text>

<Review>The selection of beverages at Little Sweet is huge! Fruit, milk, blends. They have them all here!
I like the fact that there is an ordering stand outside the doorway. Then when your drink comes up the staff call your name.
You can scan the QR code on the window to see the menu.
You can also order snacks.
Convenient for visiting Golden Gate Park and the food corridors of 9th Avenue & Irving Streets (the Inner Sunset).
I would spend a substantial amount of $ on Little Sweets drinks if I lived closer...good thing I don’t!<//Review>< Date>

<Text>been a few times and every time the drinks are delicious!!

my number recommendation is the Creamy Thai Green Milk Tea for sure, my friend got it the first time and it was so good, i walked to this location and got it three more times after this hahaha.

super sweet workers too, helped us out so much with the ordering system and accommodating our requests for milk!

oh, and also love their reusable cups. i keep them and use them for all kinds of at-home drinks.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I used to love coming to Little Sweet on 9th and grabbing a Boba and a waffle to go. I remember when they opened a little over a year ago and we lived around the corner and were some of the first customers. Unfortunately as of late they’ve become overloaded with delivery orders they can’t keep up with personal orders and the last two times I’ve ordered ahead, my order was ready almost 30 minutes after scheduled pick up time (thats 45 minutes from initial order placement).

I get that the business is booming, but it would be great to get a system that accurately predicts order time.

Save yourself and check out the new boba spot down the street instead.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Really nice tea. Everything is super high quality. Not only is it delicious, the cup feels really solid and they use paper straws.

Tapioca is also VERY well done and taste amazing. I still recommend 50-75% sweet. But I docked a star because it costs extra to reduce the ice. Also know that tapioca are not included.< /text>< Date>

The mango pomelo sago is so delicious here! Their waffle pastries are also so good too. My friends and I came here for an afternoon snack and this hit the spot. It's a bit pricey for $8 but the cups are cute.

I came here and they have a QR code for you to order online. It was super easy to order. Then you get a text to pick up your order. And my order was done 10 min faster than they said it was!

Little sweet is so good and super easy to order. There were a lot of people waiting outside and social distancing safely for their orders. I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and fellow boba lovers!</Review>

<Review>I wish that more people knew about this place. I also wish I could've found this place prior to covid it looks like the vibe was kick a**. It's in a perfect location in ky opinion. You get some boba and hit the parks down the street. I ordered online and my drink was ready by the time I arrived. I love their reusuable cups. The tea is strong and delicous.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn5d88iJSL_WV83o0BctWcoJKku7Ky5CYZEOPI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5bhBte9IxhbfLcQ3h6rGGca9P4gR4aZYot5hd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Great Boba Place!
There can be a line so I suggest ordering online ahead of time!
The strawberry Mango smoothie was a crazy mix of flavors and textures that were fun and good!
The thai tea was strong, so be prepared to be awake and alive after it!
The boba pearls were very good quality!

Definetly worth a shot!<//text>

The tea was great! The roasted Oolong was properly brewed and very flavorful. It had good proportions of milk, tea ice, and tapioca.

I also appreciate the work they have put into making a convenient, safe operation during Covid times. Ordering online is easy, and picking up requires no contact</review>

Black sugar fresh milk with small boba is the best one we have ever had! We have kids and we always look for a fresh milk (non-caffeinated) drink and they have mastered that. We have tried that same drink elsewhere and no one can replicate this masterpiece at the Little Sweet. You can control the sweetness level and the dairy. You can also request more boba! It's warm fresh boba mixed with fresh cold milk. It's a delicious treat!< /review>

It was a good bubble tea spot. The price is about average as other places. You can adjust sweetness and the ice level which is a bonus. They have a lot of different drinks, but they also have popular ones and new ones so it's easier to decide. All of the drinks I've gotten have been really good.< /review>

Beware of the small boba option, they are not satisfying. If you are drinking boba tea for the boba, stay away from small boba!

Otherwise a solid boba shop. Wish they had a "less ice" option for online ordering.</review>

Great new bubble tea place! I had their kumquat lemon tea, and the flavor was subtle with a good balance between citrus, sweet, and sour. Bubble tea is bubble tea, but there were subtle details of flavor that sweet this place apart.</Review>

The basic black tea could have been richer, but the rose tea was amazing! Well, every place has its speciality. I'm looking forward to coming back when I'm in the neighborhood<//Review>

<Review>Pretty solid place. Primarily non-dairy. Can ask for milk substitution for 0.50

Relatively pricey compared to nearby boba stores, but they use real tea and have some rare teas.

Recommend it. But a tad pricey< /Review>< pics>

I normally got my boba from the one on Geary. But since the Geary one is closed, I used this location for the first time to pick up my online order. I ordered matcha green tea with boba and grass jelly, paid 50 cent each for it, but they forgot the grass jelly. I was in a rush picking up two other drinks for friends, I didn’t realize it until I was in Sausalito to meet my friends that they forgot to put the grass jelly on my order and they did charge me for it. I was really disappointed - I never had this problem when ordering from Geary location. I can’t wait for the Geary location to re-open. I will not go back to this location ever again unfortunately. First experience - bad. Sorry, but the person prepping the drink should have paid attention to the order.  I always order the same thing, and always get it right at Geary location. Not this place. Two stars.</Text>

It's a solid boba place. This is in there more upscale end with prices to match - $5 base and add on for any extras. The tea is tasty, there are some interesting options like Thai green tea and they have real dairy options. The boba pearls are a bit hit and miss but normally pretty good. It's the only boba place in the area, so glad to have it. Nice ambiance and service. Just wish it was a little cheaper.</text>

I wouldn't say it was bad, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. It was still great and I loved how many toppings they had. I loved the store and what they have put into it. I am so excited to see what comes next in the boba place.< /review>< user_name>

<review>My daughters have been going to WCKM for approx. 3 years now. Their Children's programs are nothing short of amazing!! Mrs. Jenn , Mrs Stephanie, Mrs Tia and Mr Eric are excellent instructors and truly care about our kids. I feel like they are an extension of our family  and am so lucky to have found them. I would recommend West Coast Krav Maga to anyone interested.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

My daughter (12) has been going there since she was 4. Not only has she gained incredible determination and respect for herself. She has made many friends her age and the older kids are excellent mentors, not to mention Mrs. Stefanie, Mrs. Jennifer, Mr. Eric and lets not forget Sensei John (the list goes on). Of all the things she has started and maybe grown out of, she says she will never stop Krav.<//Text>

Such an amazing staff and program! You won't be disappointed. Our son loves going to class and is learning not only self defense but valuable character traits and discipline that will be valuable throughout his life.< /Text>

<text>I have both of my kids enrolled in classes and the instructors couldn't get more perfect for their role of teaching my kids self defense. I am looking forward to watching them both excel in the West Coast Krav Maga program. Also, I visit both locations and they're excellent at both so I am sure the new Wildomar locations awesome!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><GmapID>0x80db7f558e017487:0x7b8c12804e751966</GmapID>< Rate>

The training, atmosphere, and dedication by the instructors is second to none. Hands down one of the best activities that you can get yourself and your family involved in.<//review>

Great family/great business!!
Go at your pace or as hard as you can! 5 year olds to old has-beens like me. There is a spot for you! Get in shape, stop allowing yourself to be a target or a victim.<//Review>

<text>I am very happy with my experience at West Coast Krav Maga.  The training is both practical for self defense and good for overall fitness and movement.  And the staff are all excellent, thoughtful, and caring.</text><name>Steve Altfillisch</name>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>The instructors are so awesome. I have been taking krav for a year now. I started krav to build my own self esteem. But I gained so much more. The family who runs the business has become my family. I'm in much better physical shape. I have learned how to defend myself. I am able to control my anxiety with out medication. I have scoliosis too and no matter what the technique is there is always super from staff and a modified way to practice the techniques. My back doesn't hurt like it used too either. I love krav.< /review><gmapID>0x80db7f558e017487:0x7b8c12804e751966< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1498575684909, 'text': "Mr. & Mrs. Lopez,\n\nI just saw your reviews that you wrote.  I know it will hurt my business, but I'm glad you said what you said...\n\nYour right, we did not honor our policy.  We offer to cancel a membership without the 30 day notice to cancel, should a member cancel with the 1st 30 days.\n\nAnd that is exactly what you did.  Me and my family have been running martial arts schools since 1986, and to be honest no one ever has canceled within the 1st month, so my staff didn't even think of checking the date... I'm sorry for this, and I have put a system in place so this doesn't happen again.\n\nWe have refunded the last 2 payments back into your account, please allow a day or two for the funds to go back....\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for this terrible inconvenience to you and your family.\n\nYour son Ayden, only attended 5 classes, which were during the last 2 weeks of our 3 month cycle.  Your son's last class was on the 8th, and our test for all youth was on the 13th.  Why so many kids in the class was that since we offer unlimited classes to all our members and do not have set days for members to come in, to allow a flexible schedule to parents who have other kids in different activities,  kids were coming in to extra days before the test to practice for the test...\n\nWe pride ourselves in offering quality instruction to our students, and we do our best during the last week before a test.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for this mix up.\n\nMr. & Mrs Lopez I want to offer a 3 month no obligation & no cost membership to your son, Ayden, so you can see what we really offer to our members.\n\nI hope that you guys will forgive us, and have your son come train with us again.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Gabriele"}<//resp>

<review>First impressions are good! The tank bag has some seriously solid construction, and feels very durable. It sits securely on my tank, and even for it's size, doesn't at all get in the way of my riding. So far I'm pretty impressed! Can't get over how much room the bag has for a tank bag! I could probably live out of it on a trip if I wanted!<//review>< pictures>

Hi all. I recently purchased a sissy bar bag. Motorcycle house were very fast in advising item had been posted. When I asked for a tracking number via online chat the person named David gave me that information in no time. Could not be happier with the overall service. Especially nice to be sorted out there and then on the spot. Highly recommend<//Review>

I have ordered twice from Motorcycle House. While the price is good, there obviously are some issues with their system/process. None of my orders have ever shipped without me calling in and making it happen (beyond the manual verification they require).

Currently been waiting over a week for my latest order to be shipped and have contacted them 3 times. It gets to a point where it doesn't matter if I'm saving 5% if I have to go through all this hassle just to get my stuff.

UPDATE: It's now been almost a month since I placed my order. They updated my order status to "Completed" but the boots I ordered still have yet to arrive... Attempts to contact them have been unanswered.

UPDATE 2: My boots are supposed to be delivered today (27 days after ordering). After contacting them twice more they expedited my order to me. Sounds like maybe my experience has been an unusual customer experience. If the order would have just come in a reasonable time without so much work to get it I would order from them again, but given my experiences, I will not be ordering from them again.</Text>

Viking Cycle Enforcer Three Quarter Touring Motorcycle: When I received the Enforcer jacket, I gave it a good going over. It has many nice features going for it. It is well made and the medium jacket fits me very well. This is a great jacket for a really good price.  I really like that the jacket is longer in the back. This extra length prevents the back from riding up when sitting or riding. The armor protection in the spine, shoulder & elbow seem to be of good quality and comparable with armor in other jackets. The Enforcer jacket has many useful pockets in places I would have never thought of. I'm still finding uses for the pockets. After a 400 mile ride in cool weather and some rain the jacket preformed very well.

If you are looking for a good riding jacket for a great price, I think you may want to give the Enforcer Touring Jacket  from Motorcycle House a hard look.</Text>

<review>A very shady organization!!!  Not to be trusted!!!  Ordered a pair of chaps, to small.  Sent back asking for different size, week later no response.  Emailed sever times, week later still no response.  This time emailed again from a different link demanding a return and refund.  It’s been over a week since they received the chaps back with tracking number and no refund yet.  I’ve emailed for the last week demanding to know about my refund, no response yet to my email.  These people are a piece of work and do not care about about their customers at all!!  Avoid at all costs!!!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c32c05695f4e65:0xf91a0bc4ae5dd41b<//gmap_id>< pictures>

Grate job David!!
I would Highly recommend these guys and their product to everyone. Can’t wait to post the bike up on here as well.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I ordered a jacket from motorcycle house at a fantastic price. My order has not yet shipped so I opened a chat to inquire. There was a delay because I have my US purchases delivered to a receiver for me to pick up from. (I am from Canada and cross border shipping is either not available or cost prohibitive) David was able to clarify why my shipment was delayed and made the notes necessary to get it shipped ASAP. I had hoped my package would have shipped today as the website states so that it would arrive for the weekend when I had hoped to collect my package. Unfortunately, it looks like it will be another week before I can get my new jacket.  David's service was fantastic and deserves 5* but the reason for 4 stars is because of the shipping delay and no notification of the delay.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Good first impressions. The saddle bags I got are working out perfectly for my bike. Since I did most of my perusing online, the website was easy to navigate and narrow down my search. Customer service was very good too. I got responses to my emails within a couple hours if not right away.</Review>

Clearly this is a shady organization given A. That they share the exact same address as Viking Cycles, and neither company can give you a straight answer about the Viking Jackets.... their Chat Customer Support is unbelievably bad and telephone support is almost worse!! Clearly all these 5-Star Reviews are from Hand Puppets (the company padding their rating by using fake accounts and reviews) because in my experience just getting simple answers from them about product features is a complete joke!! And readying the other 1-Star reviews I see people giving me examples more in line with my experience with them.... I guess I should count myself lucky that I didn't try to actually order anything from them.... because I couldn't get answers about the products or shipping.</text>

Just had a live chat with David in terms of a particular saddle bag for my 2011 HD Fat Bob. David indicated that they are not currently in stock in Australia but mentioned they are being shipped to Australia as we speak and should be on the shelf in a week. So good to receive immediate accurate info from someone who is on the ball....well done David. (someone needs to give him a pay rise!!!)</text>

I am an Australian customer and every part of my dealings with Motorcycle House was absolutely fantastic.  The website for online purchasing is very easy to navigate and all products on the site have very detailed information and sizing information for clothing which makes you feel very confident before purchasing.  The delivery of the product once purchased was amazingly quick and absolutely hassle free.  All communication with staff at Motocycle House super friendly and very helpful.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking to purchase motorcycle gear.<//review>

Ordered a jacket 3 days ago and wanted an ETA on delivery as I am leaving the country in a couple of weeks. Contacted them via live chat.  David responded within a couple of minutes, found my order and advised exactly what will happen and when it will be delivered.  David was prompt and efficient and got me an answer within minutes. Would use again.<//Text>

<text>Bought a jacket and some chaps from these guys but wanted to see them in person before I purchased I gave them a call and asked if I could stop by before ordering and they were very accommodating. They gave me their business hours and were available when I stopped by. It's a small location and it doesn't seem like they get much foot-traffic but they were helpful and allowed me to check out different sizes before purchasing. Since I was taking the jacket there and then they also refunded me the shipping cost. Will buy again!<//text>< Resp>

Cool website, sent me a jacket to review for my YouTube channel. Would like to work them on providing some minor improvements for their jackets. Great company!</text>

They advised me by the "chat screen" and said the Viking bags were in stock. After several days and no replies to any emails, I put a hold on the Paypal payment and they contacted me straight away (amazing isn't it). 5 days later they said it was going to dispatched, 10 days passed and they finally dispatched the Viking bags.
For a company that say 1-3 days delivery and a warehouse in Australia, I would never purchase from them again, worst customer service I have experienced
I advise all to avoid this company< /review>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE....I received my initial order with out issues. Unfortunately, the gloves i ordered were too small so I asked for an exchange. I had to pay freight back (ok - I get it and not an issue) However, it has taken over a month to get the exchange product and they keep blowing me off. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. Can't get a credit or the product and they won't call or email back. I only get lip service about it "shipping tomorrow and we'll send a tracking #." Complete BS. Be wary if you have to return or exchange anything!!<//text>

I have to say I am extremely impressed with the customer service.  I am a motovlogger and have tons of questions and not only have they answered everything they have done so in just moments after I send them.
All their info has been accurate as well, is rare to see a knowledgeable staff that is also willing to help.< /review>

<Text>Good company that stands behind their product. They sent me the wrong size leather jacket and quickly fixed the issue. Nice jacket, but even better price. Ventillation is great on the jacket for longer rides, I would recommend their mesh style jacket to anyone!<//Text>< pictures>

I haven't received my order yet but the process of buying was made easier with some great live chat form David. I will review again when order received. One more comment I thought the postage price a little high.<//Text>

Ordered a Viking Enforcer Touring Jacket on May 4th from Motorcycle House and received it May 9, Great service and SUPER fast delivery from the US to CANADA (5 days including weekend). At first glance it looks well made and plenty of pockets. Not too heavy or cumbersome. I will try it out this weekend and report back.

<Text>Viewing the website from NZ, and decided to use the online chat feature to enquire about the Viking bags. Received a reply from David nearly immediately, who sent me a link to the page which contained the saddle bags that would fit my bike, and answered the shipping questions I had. Well pleased, and excited to be able to get my hands on a new saddle bag so quickly and easily. Thanks again!< /Text>< pics>

David was excellent assisted me in my enquiries if it was suitable for my motorcycle went to the trouble of sourcing a photo showing how it fitted and what it would look like.  I appreciated the service and prompt information sent.  Takes the uncertainty out of making a purchase.<//Review>

<text>Placed an order for a helmet that I needed right away, and these people did not send it out because they couldn't figure out the address. I called to clear it up after not hearing from them for about a week. After another week they still didn't send the order, so I called again, same issue.

A company that not only tries to be there for our motorcycle needs but for the needs as a custamer as well. Special thank you to Ania, For puttting up with all of my e-mails. Love this company!! Have to ad it is nice when a company not only cares about the riders but is Lady Bikers friendly also. Thank you!< /Review>

I purchased the Viking Swing Arm Bag for my 09 Nightster. I couldnt be more satisfied with the product and the Viking Bags company. The shipping was expedited quickly. The side bag is sturdy, easy to put on because of all the hardware included, it looks fantastic and you cant beat the quality for the price that you pay. -Dustin< /text>

<text>( Refers to the Euro/UK branch of the company. I have had no dealings with the USA )
Possibly the biggest time wasters that it has ever been my misfortune to deal with. Ordered some saddlebags for my son's Christmas present 12 days ago. When not so much as an acknowledgement was received, I used their "chat line" to ask for information. On three successive days, I was promised an e-mail about the status of my order within 24 hours. Not a single e-mail was received. On the fourth attempt at constructive communication, they had clearly got sick of me, admitted they were having difficulties with shipping and stated that my money would be refunded within 24 hours. They are advertising the goods but clearly don't have the wherewithall to deliver them efficiently. Use them at your peril and expect to be fobbed off, lied to and generally messed about. Hope I get my money back!</text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a pair of Viking saddle bags for my VTX 1800, in less than 6 months the "leather" started to peel off, not only that, the product shown on the videos wasn't the same product I got, I contacted customer service and they told me that the materials where not covered by warranty; then, what is covered?
If you want a good quality long lasting product, this is not the place to get it.</Text>

<Text>This company obviously caters to locals, I ordered a helmet in XL tried it on and it was small. Sent it back to get the next size up. They sent me pictures back saying it was scuffed up and had dark spots on it.  Issued a PARTIAL refund without asking because the merchandise is "used" and want me to pay for the next size up. So sad when online retailers wont work with there customers.  Up to you if you are willing to risk it. Cost me 60$to try on a helmet.<//Text><Response>None</Response><user_id>111684842111283612793<//user_id>< time>

I was required to call to confirm all order and contact information before they would ship. I was disgusted by Julios behavior and wouldn't trust a company that would employ such an individual.
I recommend keeping an eye on your credit card statements after dealing with this seedy company.< /text></record>

Wish I could give it negative stars.  Ordered a vest that their website said was in stock.  It wasn't.  2 days after I was supposed to have received the vest (5 days after I placed my original order) I send messages inquiring about shipping info or an update on my order.  I receive a message 2 days later that it's not in stock (even thought their site still says it is) and it should ship that following Monday.  2 days after it was supposed to ship I send messages once again inquiring about my order and get an email stating it isn't even stock at their supplier and asking if I would like to wait 4 to 5 weeks for it to ship or would I like a refund. I request a refund.  They respond another 2 days later saying I should have my refund within 24 to 48 hours.  One week after that 24/48 hours had passed, STILL no refund.  I'm beginning fraud proceedings to get my money back via PayPal.  Over a month dealing with them over an item their site said was in stock, and still no item, no refund, no nothing.  Don't do business with this company.  I will never again do business with them.</Text>

In a word - Terrible !
Order taken then no communication, they don't answer e mails, phone calls or instant messages.
Item not delivered -  a sham - probably a ghost company scamming credit cards and PayPal payments.
Avoid like the plague !!<//review>

Did not have the gloves I ordered
Said they would refund my card....four calls still waiting for refund......
Made me feel I was wrong for calling
First stated the refund in 3 days
Then said they sent to PayPal
Then said contact my bank
Called they said no manager on duty
Never never had this problem with ebay or cyclegear........
I am very disappointed in the service..
The other products came no problems</Review>

<user_name>Scott & Victoria</user_name><review>Terrible experience on my first order with them. Ordered 18th April, told via live chat it was despatched on 21st, gets to 26th and I spend two days chasing via live chat for a tracking number but told a technical issue prevents that. Then on 28th told it WAS NOT despatched due to a technical issue. Absolutely terrible levels of service and competence. Will never use or recommend them.</review>< user_id>

I had to write this review because this happened to me two years ago and I am still upset about it. I had a coupon for an 11 point inspection. It listed everything that would be gone over. I sat down in the lobby with one car ahead of me, and I was called back in less than 10 minutes later saying they were finished.....already?! So I join the technician who walks me around the car and everything looks ship shape, and I am livid because I knew things that were wrong with my car.

I took him to the windshield wipers, one of which was missing and was an item on the inspection. I asked if they were okay and he said yes. I showed him the missing one and he says "Oh....must've missed that"....but this went on for another 4 or 5 line items. A car is a black box to me. I should not be able to do an inspection better than someone accepting money for it. Safe to say I never went back and neither should you.</Text>

I trust these guys with everything they are able to do.  I have taken my personal cars and work vehicles there for years.  If they can't fix it, or if they are just too busy to fix it right away, they will always recommend another place for you to go.<//Review>

always had good experiences here. Good customer service. My only complaint is that they didn't put my filters back into my car correctly and i had to spend 100 bucks somewhere else to get my check engine light looked at. Pretty costly mistake that will give me pause the next time either of my cars need to be serviced.<//Text>

Had to replace a catalytic converter that was stolen from my daughters car. We called several shops and Midas had the best price and prompt service. They came through as promised and installed the replacement and a protective plate that afternoon. Thanks Midas! Hopefully the thieves will get caught!< /text>

<Review>Have brought my cars here a couple of times and have had the absolute best experience! Teresa (I believe that’s the name) in the front desk is always super helpful and polite weather I call or in person. Recently had an issue with my AC, called a couple of places with different prices/ experiences. I was loosing hope that I would be able to get my car serviced in Davis until I received an email that SpeeDee also works with AC! Called and dropped my car off and they took care of it quickly and explained the issue. After this experience, they have a customer for life!<//Review>< Rating>

< Review>
Came in for a tire diagnosis and waited 5 hours before calling to check the status. They mis-read my work order and thought my car was waiting for a tire shipment and they would get right on it and would definitely get it on the lift. 2 more hours go by and then I'm told that after 2 test drives the mechanic wouldn't put my car on the lift to try and diagnose the problem and recommend I go to the dealer. I arrive to pick up my car and there are 2 other cars in line for the lift. I suppose their "first come first serve" policy only applies if your problem requires minimal work on their end to solve. Strongly advise against going here.</Review>

<review>Thought it was a mufller shop based on the Midas name. Was surprised to find out it was anything but. Asked if they could do a simple repair to my exhaust pipe, was told they dont use their welder. What kind of muffler place doesn't have someone qualified to run a welder?? If u want an oil change ur in the right place. Beyond that, find a real shop!!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Even-though I live in Sacramento  I work in Davis so after work I will stop in  to the Spee-dee store  in Davis for a oil change. I have been going there for awhile The owners always make the visit very enjoyable. They treat me and my vehicle very well. I t is very hard now a days to find a business of this caliber  that offers a service in that when you leave you will have a good feeling and  be happy that you went there. I always am.

<Date>1552265149511<//Date><review>SpeeDee Midas in Davis has been terrific for me and my 1997 Honda Civic. They are my go-to place when I have any kind of trouble. They have been professional, no-nonsense mechanics every time. Their rates are reasonable, and I know exactly what they will charge me because they always check before they do a repair. There are no surprises with these folks. They can get busy, so make sure that they can fit you in on a schedule that fits yours. Even there, though, they've been great at letting me know what is possible. I've never been disappointed.</review><gmap_id>0x808529bdcfde26a5:0x3d8565365ab6bf4f< /gmap_id>< rating>

<Review>Mornings seem to get a little backlogged, but push your plans till later in the day and it's typically quite speedee.

Great prices for oil changes. Repair costs can be a little higher than alternatives, but still a good price for quality work.

Excellent and friendly staff. I came in for an oil change and was out the door in about forty minutes. The techs went over everything with me and advised a few minor additional items that should be done soon, but were not essential. When I declined and said I wanted to wait until another day, the tech was not pushy and was very understanding.

My wife brought her car in at the same time and was advised to do some additional maintenance which was a little more pressing, and we were pleased with the speed and cost of the service.

Definitely would recommend, and I imagine my next oil change will be here as well.</text>

I have been going to this Speedee for the last 7 years, I moved to Woodland and still drive out of my way to go to the Davis shop. I have never had a bad experience, the staff is honest, informative and I would say prides themselves on recommending the best to all their customer. Teresa is the only owner I have had the pleasure of being introduced to but I commend whoever else is involved in staffing and running this shop. I told my fiance not to go anywhere else and just hit this Speedee and she'll be more than taken care of. Thank you so much to everyone who has helped on my car, special shout out to Marco's who has almost always worked on my car you are awesome man!<//text>

< Review>
These guys are smooth and did a great job of changing my oil. More expensive than most places but took me in last minute, in the evening. While doing this, they insisted on up-selling me on anything and everything they could. After sizing me up they started by telling me how difficult and how much work it would take to change a light. Literally telling me, well we might have to take the bumper off, and then have to balance it to put it back on. The price was ridiculous and they flat out lied on the amount of time ($$$/hr Labor) it would take. They even said one light was out when it was not. I had to turn them on myself to prove this. They had it on the setting where those lights were not on but the other were when they showed me. The employees laughed with each other as they made quotes and told me what I needed changed. Actually looking at each other mid conversation with me, and smile and look down. “It’s basically illegal to be driving this car with this belt and these tires.” It was anything but comfortable to be in their waiting area. Heard a customer ask, “why did you tell me last time that I needed this replaced to drive out of here, and one week later, you don’t even mention it.” She did not have an answer, just an apology. And “he typically doesn’t do that.” Every question I asked was draining on them, and they were overall not helpful. They make a commission on the sale, so taking suggestions and advice is not an intelligent decision.  Everything is bias and they directly make cash money for everything they convince you is wrong with your car/truck/SUV. It is too bad, but that is the reality of the situation.

One of the hardest parts for me was knowing what the manufacturer recommended on checking and replacing. Then hearing them make up numbers and requirements. I felt bad for anyone who didn’t think to ask twice, a simple google search and/or YouTube video could save you significantly, financially and mentally. Which sucks bc you want to trust and make it personal.< /Review>

This is the worst place you would ever want to do business with. I took my car for oil change and Uber inspection to SpeeDee shop in Davis, California, they cracked my windshield, denied it, and refused to fix it. My windshield was perfect and in fact I was taking the car to be certified fit for use with Uber, one of them splashed water on the windshield and cracked it. Went to get the vehicle, found the windshield cracked and when talked to them they said I have to talk to the manager who was not there at the time, waited about 2 hours, he came, talked to the him-the rudest manager I ever came across- he said he has to check the video, after an hour came and said it did not happen at their place, went and looked to the video with him and it was obvious at a point they all gathered on my car checking the windshield, at that point he threatened to throw me out of the office and abused me. When I insisted and told them I was going to call the police, he started to blackmail me telling me if I chose to go to court it will not be settled in years, eventually he agreed to pay part of what the repairs will cost. I email their corporate office, and they told me they will investigate and came back to tell me I accepted the manager's offer and they can do nothing!
Do not do business with this place with incompetent staff!<//review>

<Review>I called for a quote. I was told $29.99 for a synthetic blend oil change. When I arrived 10 minutes later, I was told $79.99 for full synthetic and that they didn't have a synthetic blend for a Prius. I agreed to the $79.99. After the service, I was told they vacuumed the interior as part of the service. This was 100% false. They gave me a $10 discount at checkout and did not state why. The $10 discount is why I'm putting 2 stars instead of 1.</Review>< userid>

My preferred oil change location in the Sac/Davis area. Busy on weekends, though. They also do smog checks.<//review>

<review>I came at 7:40 am and when they opened I was the last one to be helped , the workers skipped me and went to serve people who came after me, I don't know why, how come I am in the front and they skip me and serve the customer who came 20 minutes after and is behind me.< /review>< pictures>

This is a great spot in Hollywood for happy hour cocktails and small bites. I've been a few times, and each time I've been very satisfied. The drinks are always good and the food is great.

It's a cute, little space with a great ambiance. If you're looking for a happy hour spot right in the neighborhood, or close to Sunset Blvd., check it out.< /review>

A nice choice for having American traditional foods within a nice environment. This restaurant is loved much because of it's amazing spices. Some of their popular dishes are Shrimp Tacos, Fried Calamari, Cheesy Pizza and many drinks items.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Wondering why this place always full packed. Visited this place for the first time. Hmmm, place is trendy and I liked being that way. The bar is very tempting but I'll have the menu. Food was exquisite. I couldn't ask for more, but definitely come back for more. Best experience at The Parker Room. Serving and price is fair enough. Need to announce this to my friends.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Absolutely love this restaurant! Food is excellent and selection is unique! Type of place you can make a regular stop! Staff is very attentive! Management makes you feel like you have come home! Have to recommend the fried chicken. It is offered as an appetizer, but is more than enough for an entree.  Will return to The Parker Room on regularly!</review>

< Review>
I was really looking forward to listening to a really nice jazz or blues music so we decided to go to the Parker Room on a Saturday night for the first time. The bartender was great but the minute we walked in we realized that nothing was going on. Just a bar:(  All their advertising material online was confusing for me because it sounded like you are going to a jazz club with a big history behind it and that was not the case. Apparently it's only one night a week and that is Tuesday nights.< /Review>

<text>This is such a great place! Took such good care of me by making a custom drink based on just a few questions! Great music. Super friendly. Great drinks. What's not to love?
I want to post more pictures but the lighting is dim. Note that the bar space with live music (on Tuesdays) is a small space but they have a wonderful restaurant and full bar connected as well.<//text>< pictures>

The guys running it Dave and Sam were really awesome. This was an old jazz club in 40s and really cool to be in a space that has so much history. Will def. be back when I'm in town.</Text><username>frank harris</username>< Date>

A wonderful little bar, romantic ambience, and one of the best happy hours I've come across! (i.e. $7 taco plates, $6 prosecco.) I'll definitely be coming back!<//Text>

< Review>
After leaving the restaurant Los Balcones because of their incompetence to serve customers, I was pleasantly surprised to find The Parker Room literally right next door. I've had this gem bookmarked for a while so it was a special treat.. the only thing is that The Parker Room is connected to the Los Balcones barf (read previous review to comprehend my negative feelings). It looks closed from the outside but don't let their darn good tinted doors fool ya. Once you enter, your first reaction is going to be "I feel claustrophobic" because it's tiny and cramped if you come on a busy night. It's an informal friendly atmosphere with great happy hour deals and cocktails. There's a wide selection of finger food, main entrees, and alcoholic beverages for HH from 6-8 PM (I believe every day of the week). And I'm talking about $7 food items and well drinks!! What a steal! All our food items exceeded our expectations and was pleasantly enjoyable. The bartenders/waitresses were super friendly and were able to run the whole place with just two of em'. I feel in love with everyone's aura and to top it off they played great jazz music. From what I know, they have live jazz performance on Tuesday's.

Don't bring a group of people because everyone will not fit. For a low key one on one time, perfect. Enjoy some good food, while sipping on a cocktail and listening to great music! *In Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice* I'll be back.< /Review>

< Review>
I received Mohs surgery for a Basal Cell Cancer, right in the middle of my nose bridge. The Glendale Dermatology office was incredible. From the first doctor who visited me and took a biopsy of my tissue. But the star was definitely Doctor Maggie Chow! She was my surgeon. Through the whole process, she was so incredibly professional, kind and genuinely made me feel like she cared about my issue. Talking to her quickly made me realize she’s not just an amazing professional, but also an awesome human being. She not only cared about resolving my health issue, but also to do so in a way that was aesthetically perfect. I just removed my stitches today, only one week after the procedure, and my skin is healing extremely well. She was impeccable before, during and after surgery. I can’t recommend her enough. I strongly advise you to seek Doctor Chow’s surgical services for any of your dermatological issues.<//Review>

This was my first visit here as a patient after coming to their Open House event. I scheduled a consult for a suspicious mole and their front office staff was excellent in ensuring I knew what forms I needed prior to coming in and which doctors worked with my healthcare group.

I got booked to see Dr. Navi and on the day of my appointment my wait time was short, less than 10 minutes. Waiting room was not crowded (because COVID). Dr. Navi was thorough when he examined my mole and educated me on the type of mole I had. I felt assured and he answered my questions very well. He did not push any service(s) or treatment on me since it was not needed. I was left with the decision after being presented with the pros and cons of removing it for cosmetic reasons.

Their staff of nurses were very nice and attentive during my room check-in. I left very satisfied with my consult and choice in choosing SBC!<//text>

<review>I went to the Glendale Dermatology for the first time for I've had a small raised black spot below my neck for several months, which I thought was a bad mole.  Dr. Navi came in and told me it was just a black head that he can drain out and there is no charge, and he drained it in a minute.  It was done and no more concerns!  I couldn't believe in this time and age there was a doctor who was so honest and caring.  All along he was just being so kind, friendly and didn't act like he was doing me a great favor.  The office staff were also very kind and pleasant.  Just sharing my unbelievably good experience I've had today at his office in Glendale CA.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

<time>1568951105753< /time><rating>5</rating><text>I have been seeing Dr. Park and now Dr. Kang at Glendale Dermatology for the past couple of years, and couldn't be happier with their service, results, time spent with me at each session, detailed explanation of process and costs, and their results!  I have loved them so much, I've referred several clients of my own from ElectroYogi for their dermatological concerns, and my clients have all been thrilled, too!

Dr. Kang has been my doctor recently, as Dr. Park moved to the West Hills location, I believe.  Dr. Kang has helped me with some skin growths/raised small moles and such, where she zaps them off the skin with overnight healing time.  As a woman in my mid/late 40s, I've also been recently inquiring about the different cosmetic procedures offered at the office.  Dr. Kang always explains exactly how things would work, what they would cost, any side effects or downtime, and more. She is terrific also because she has not once pushed me into any treatments. In fact, twice I went to ask her more details about what I could do for the lines above my upper lip, which are really the only thing about my aging face that frustrates me, and each time she carefully walked me through what the process would be , and never once encouraged me to 'go for it.'

That said, just today, after more than a year of consideration, I did my first ever cosmetic procedure for those upper lip lines.  We did a combination of Volbella dermal filler and a tiny amount of botox to help with the staying power of the line filler.  The process was fascinating, and looks so far great.  I have a small amount of swelling above my upper lip, but it is already going down, and I am happy with the immediate reduction of the lines. She did not plump up my upper and lower lip at all, and really focused on helping me with the lines while keeping a super natural look. Dr. Kang informed me that my naturally (and as a child, embarrassingly) big lips have lost some volume at my age, but she didn't try to have me fill the actual lips to be any bigger.  I'm looking forward to seeing how it looks in a couple of days.

Dr. Kang also recommended that I consider micro-needling on the face to help rebuild some collagen and elastin that is naturally decreasing in the aging process. I'm considering it. But what I loved most is that Dr. Kang didn't immediately try to schedule me for it.  She simply provided first-rate service, with kindness, and at a fair price.  I'll be continuing to recommend her to all my ElectroYogi Electrolysis clients!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Definitely do not come here, they first scar you and then offer scar treatment .  Ridiculous with prices as well and forget about dealing with insurance when it comes to them, they do not verify anything before hand and then send you a bill when you thought you had already paid for the services.  Definitely a hole in the wall dermatology office only concerned about sucking your money.<//Review>

Since it is of our utmost concern to ensure patient satisfaction, I invited you contact me directly. I would like to discuss your specific incident and help you in any way I can. Since your name is not found in our patient data base it is difficult to discern if you are speaking from personal experience or sharing someone else’s opinion.  If a patient is having difficulty understanding their billing statement after the visit or have questions about their bill during the visit, we do have a full time billing clerk on staff to answer all questions at any time.  So when you have time or feel otherwise compelled, please give us a call or stop by Glendale Dermatology. You are always welcome.'}< /resp>< gmapID>

A nice place for a nerf gun battle. A nice size for larger parties but the obstacles in their play area is a bit sparse. You have 75 minutes of play which has a good amount of time but it's mostly free play. There was one game between teams with scoring and that was really fun. A bit more "organized" play would have been nice but the kids didn't seem to mind.

Although you can upgrade the party for $4/child so they can try out a larger variety of guns I would recommend you stay basic. The larger guns tend to jam more and take longer to load.

You can bring in water and a fruit plate platter but food and drinks for a party needs to be ordered thru the venue.</Review>

These facilities are a Wonderful place to visit. THE many stores in this area you can definitely get whatever you are seeking at at least a single facility and more likely to find the needed products at additional local facilities . Each of my purchasing experience at these facilities  has been rewarding.<//Review>

<review>Kids had a great time, their only complaint was they wished they didnt have to play by the house rules. They broke them down into teams. Kids preferred to play against each other. Everyone against everyone. No teams. But overall kids had a great time< /review>< user_name>

<review>Once again Tag n Target delivered! We had my sons 10th birthday party here Nerf Wars was the theme and everyone had an awesome time. The staff and owner are great hostess, they help set up, food orders everything full service. And I am not easily pleased so this review is from a person who believes in customer service and getting what you pay for, and the never failed.</review></record></dataset><record>

This place rocks! The staff was so nice they handled everything from start to finish. Even went outside and grabbed a case of water from our car so that we would not miss out on the fun with the kids. The way they set it up is great free play for the majority of the time then they have two set up games, team death match and capture the flag. The kids loved it and can't wait for the next party there.<//text>

Great for kids that want to blow off some steam and shoot each other with Nerf guns. There are games that are played like capture the flag and others as well. If you do the party pack, you can shoot and play different games led by an instructor for 75 minutes. There is an eating area for 24 people after games are played, you bring your party food/drink/cake.< /Review>

The variety they had was amazing, and the fun of shooting was great! You're more likely to spend most of the time reloading, but a game of target was fun and tiring.<//review>

< Review>
Headed for the opthalmologist this morning.... a day after a birthday party for a bunch of 9 years olds. My son took a shot to the eye and awoke complaining of blurry vision. I'm sure it will be fine ..... It seems that his eye protection was not fitted properly and kept slipping off. Beware.<//Review>

Hands down the best restaurant in San Francisco ! The Chef is a god with food and the bartender is incredible.  The service was exceptional.  Elegance and romantic atmosphere, minus the live karaoke guy in the corner.
Will definitely be back and recommend this place to all.</Review>

I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. Two levels of fun! They have A few different areas for dining. We actually sat on the rooftop level and it was a wide open space. It was so beautiful and warm from the heaters they had. The prices vary from what you order. We had steak, chicken, crab cakes, sides (sharable) & drinks and for 4. The bill came to 483 gratuity included. But we still tipped ☺️<//review>

The service was amazing. I took my bestie for her  b-day they went above and beyond. As we eat we watched our car being broken into. They held our food while attended to the car. Comp our desert and nice glass of champagne for out trouble. Amazing food. The butter cake to die for.  Just an amazing restaurant but the outside surroundings are the slums. Definitely not a cheap date</Text>

Steaks and drinks excellent. Service on point. Management was aloof and not as professional as the experienced staff. The bartender was rude to my date, post meal which left us walking away sad. We spent over 500 dollars for the two of us, including 15 for every side of butter not included with the meal. Lobster mashed potatoes are soupy. I commented to the manager who insisted they are supposed to be soupy. He also made it clear he's afraid to criticize the chef. I've been in the industry for almost 30 years. Auto-gratuity hurts the staff. Just being honest.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I never take time to post a negative review, but in this case I feel it is warranted. The service was subpar, the food was brought out cold (twice) and everything was salty. Even the desserts were undesirable. I would only recommend this place for drinks and the sorbet. While the managerial staff was kind and accommodating, it did not make up for the overall experience.</review>< Pics>

The food was great! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Indoor seating is Covid-19 friendly with the business at 25% compassity. The menu is some what pricey.  During this partial opening the menu has been revised. No sushi, no seared tuna and no Bone marrow to name a few. I was told that they would start to serve it again in a couple of weeks. We'll see. There is also a 20% service fee included to your bill during this partial opening. All in all, with the great ambiance, food and drinks I will definitely be back and I definitely recommend.< /Text>

<Text>Celebrated my birthday here. Sat in the rooftop semi-outdoor space. It was a bit cool as the skin went down, but still a comfortable experience. We started with cocktails (good), crab cocktail appetizer (ok. Seemed previously frozen) and the bone-in filet, bone-in ribeye, sauteed broccoli, and lobster mac and cheese. Overall tasty meal. They surprised me with a complimentary slice of cheesecake beautifully decorated. We also ordered the butter cake which was amazing. We will certainly be back!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Best dining experience of my life!

Shout-out to Kristina- answered all my questions, was friendly, attentive, and the perfect waitress all around.

The drinks alone are to DIE for- house infused vodka?! Yes please! I had a cosmo and lemon drop, highly recommend.

The food was unreal! I had lobster bisque, their mushrooms and mashed potatoes as appetizers. The meal was a rack of lamb with truffle butter, my dates the twin lobster tail. It was delicious!!!! We had butter cake as desert- and oh my goooodddd! PLEASE get it! It's un-frickin-real! Live music, which was awesome btw! Thank you so much to the ENTIRE staff- awesome meal, and an experience I'll remember for years to come. Decades even! Will DEFINITELY come back when I have another pretty penny to spend. ,💚💚💚😊<//text>< UserId.>

<Text>I made reservations here for my moms birthday. I didnt realize it at the time but it requires to be dressed up a bit. The people at the front desk said were fine and took us in. We were treated very well and everyone was attentive. This was the BEST dinner we ever had. My mom and I are planning to go back in thw future. It may be a bit pricy but its worth every cent.

Maestros is the bomb for steak houses in SF.. Lounge over dinner with fabulous drinks and with a savioy wine list. We had buttery New York Strip, Rib Eye with bone, fresh asparagus and not enough room for desserr. Truly a gift in San Francisco.

Hands down the best steak I’ve ever had, it is pricey but is definitely worth it for the cut of meat you get! The service was also second to none.</Review>

This is my wife's favorite restaurant.  The service is outstanding, fun atmosphere, great music.  Be ready for an "eclectic" crowd.  But that's kind of fun.  The steak rubs are just next level.  Done flawlessly.  It's expensive but it's so worth it it's not even funny.<//Text>

<Review>Mixed review. The food was mostly excellent except for the lobster mash potatoes, it is definitely not what the picture online portrays & mgr responded Oh we jazz it up for the internet. It was dark so used the phone light to check the lobster quantity & mgr decided to comp since it was disappointing. First upscale restaurant I ever been to that charges for first basket of bread then the rest is on them, took 30mins for 1st basket & never brought a second after requested. However my steak was delicious & sautéed spinach. Maybe I'll try them again just a different location for sure.<//Review><Rate>3< /Rate><UserId.>113868286005048600112<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Wow...probably the best takeout experience ever. I had the good fortune to call and speak with Holden. He made great suggestions when I ordered - specifically the amazing butter cake. Everything was packed perfectly and beautifully. My order was promptly brought out to my car curbside and placed in the backseat. Everything was still hot by the time I got home. Steaks cooked perfectly. Pricey?  Yes. Worth it?  YES!! Looking forward to ordering again soon. Thanks Holden!<//Text>

<username>Sisi Chen< /username><Date>1584289824670</Date><Rating>4</Rating><Text>Didn't make reservation for a Friday night but there weren't that many people so got seated right away. We came here for their famous hot cake. We had it in their LA location and it was so so tasty. Did the one in SF match up? It was tasty but a bit lacking. It didn't taste as fresh because the cake part wasn't totally soft and moist, and it came out a tad colder than we remembered it to be. We still managed to finish the giant cake and it satisfied our sweettooth. In addition, there was live music but the genre of music did not match the ambience of the restaurant.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2x1iidAa4eMFbNd5HZ1HA89lh5kMoCRtH8AZR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmGfBfFdG3Rx_GBitiaVq_IGklQw7Cah0L8tMi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

So good. The sides are definitely great for sharing and the food is insanity. I got the lamb entree and practically sighed or moaned after every bite.
Also, right now cause of covid, its only rooftop/patio seating. But honestly that was great. Came in at 7pm and one person had the sun in their face but it was low enough to not be within 15 minutes.
Would definitely recommend if you want to try and celebrate when celebrating feels impossible due to the pandemic.</text>

Honestly I am very shocked by the Google rating of this restaurant, considering that they DO NOT know how to cook a steak properly. We have been in quarantine awhile though, people must have forgotten what fine dining looks like. Don't bother wasting your money here. My friend ordered a $140 steak, medium rare, and it came out medium well, almost looked burnt on some parts. Instead of making a new one, the staff tried convince him that he doesn't know what a medium well looks like 🙄 . They basically refused to replace it even though he was very unhappy with it. Terrible service. Also this company refuses to refund for the steak, and does not respond to customer phone calls or emails. For the $500 wasted here, we could've went to Gary Danko.<//review>

<user_name>Jane Khoury<//user_name><review>This is my third time at Mastros. My goal was to support during Covid and they totally missed the mark.
They over booked and under staffed. Food came out cold, cocktails were ordered and didn’t come out for 30 minutes, it was misty and manager wouldn’t close roof even 1/2 way, bathrooms were disgusting and customers were not observing the mask rule in the waiting room and the hostess was not enforcing!
Very very disappointing for those of us expecting an upscale experience but receiving sub par evening.< /review><gmapID>0x808581e76ab80ee9:0x20d6791cd5ff982a</gmapID><Time>1598855065894<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Possibly the best dining experience myself and my partner have experienced.
Troy, the bartender/waiter was so excellent and really made the night! He went above and beyond in service. Whoever manages/owns this place should definitely take care of him! All of the staff were excellent and food was absolutely delicious. We had the filet steak which was tender and perfectly cooked, and steamed broccoli which was refreshingly not over steamed, and the fries were amazing. The butter cake was insane and huge, I won’t need breakfast tomorrow.
Thanks for a great experience!</Review>

Amazing steakhouse with fantastic service.  The seafood was fresh and flavorful. Server put together a seafood tower featuring crabmeat, shrimp and snow crab legs. Presentation on point. Good list of cocktails and wine.  I ordered heart of the rib eye it was cooked to perfection. We had a table of 7 and ordered all of the sides. Skip the scallop potatoes. The lobster mashed potatoes are where it's at.<//Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>We went to the newly opened Mastro's for a birthday dinner.  Unfortunately it was a rather disappointing experience.  The atmosphere was just okay - background music was a bit too loud.  Service was way too chatty and over-attentive for a fine dining experience - I prefer staff who is attentive from afar and quickly available with a glance/signal, rather than constantly coming to the table and interrupting conversation.  Finally, the food was mediocre at best.  The salmon was oddly soft and watery and lacked flavor, which was especially disappointing considering this Mastro's touts themselves as a seafood restaurant.  I don't see us returning in the future.<//Review>< time>

<text>Main appetizer was the  Sauteed shrimp which came cold the sides were lobster macaroni and lobster mash were very blah in fact the lobster mash gave one of my friends in upset stomach and was really fishy service was also an issue in the beginning was fantastic toward the 2nd half the meal they forgot to bring extra dressing as well as another basket of bread as well as my wine which they completely forgot to bring which later on the end of giving to me for free but after the fact being that the meal was already done even the butter cake tasted burnt at the end I was very disappointed nothing like mastros in Beverly Hills.</text><userid>104633102753132262872< /userid></record>

Solid steakhouse with some live music on the second floor on certain days (I think they moved it to the third floor / roof per covid stuff).  Split some wagyu with friends and try out the scallops you won't regret it.<//review>

1 Star = Do not recommend
2 Star = Do not recommend but there were      positive aspects of the experience.
3 Star = Would recommend
4 Star = Would recommend ++service OR ++ food OR ++ ambiance (2 of 3)
5 Star = Would recommend ++service AND ++ food AND ++ambiance (3 of 3)

So the new Mastro's in SF is all about the hype and they definitely come though. Rediculous ambiance and service to back up the food, you are definitely getting your money's worth at this awesome high end steak and seafood restaurant. I've been to other Mastro's locations and this one ranks highly amongst the chain.  The attention to detail and food execution was impressive. Gluten free items are in abundance here and since they serve a la carte, ordering gluten free couldn't be easier!  By design, appetizers and side dishes are meant to be served family style. We went with lobster mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and steamed spinach. All awesome choices and very complementary to the main dishes we all chose.   Mastro's is known for their steaks right?  So I ordered up a Kansas City strip (basically a bone in NY strip). Bone in, changed the entire flavor profile of the strip for me and took it to an entirely different level. They asked how I would like it cooked and they hit it exactly as I asked for, medium with red in the center (a true medium).  Mastro's also serves A5 wagyu at up to $300 bucks a cut, but I know what I can appreciate and the strip I ordered was absolutely delicious.  We didn't order seafood during this visit but I've had the signature seafood tower here before and if you are up for awesome chilled lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp etc, this is a must have.  We corked our our own wine but the wine selection is never ending here, and they have a great selection at various price points to fit what you are looking for. Very attentive wait service but not overwhelming at the same time.  5 Star for sure.  If your are looking for high end quality food, awesome service and fantastic ambiance then this is the spot to go to. You don't just stumble across Mastro's SF, you plan on going there....<//Text>< username>

I will highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a really nice upscale dinner without getting a coursed meal.
There is a strict upscale dress code.
Making reservations its ez by phone or online.
The cork fee is 40 dollars for a 750mil bottle.
We opted to bring our bottle of Dom perignon witch if purchased on side will run you for $300
So I payed $170 for my bottle plus $40 cork fee and saved me a few  bucks.
Prices are to be expected high, and average tap for 2 with a few cocktails a few appetisers 2 antrees and dessert will run at about  $300+.
We had 2 appetisers, 2 cocktails, 2 antrees, 2 side dishes and a dessert.
Our bill was 375$
Here is a list of dishes ordered.
Roasted bone marrow.
Seafood tower.
South of France cocktail.
Elder flower martini.
Filet 8oz.
Bone-In Filet 12oz.
Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.
Rosemary Garlic Sautéed Mushrooms.
Butter Cake.
The Bone marrow is really good an will recomend it to anyone willing to try something new. How ever the one we got was a bit gamey. I have to say I had better but I would still recommend it.
please note that the seafood tower is fully customisable and they will plated on a tower with dri ice on it witch make it really cool and hazy I recommend if your trying to impress your special someone or if you just love sea food we got shrimp cocktail which is 3 jumbo size shrimp they are extremely fresh and succulent also got 2 king crab claws that I would not recommend getting due to their small size your better of getting the king crab legs.
The 2 cocktail we got were really good and would recommend trying them out.
The filets were good but I wish I actually had ordered the Bone in ribeye.
The side dishes were delicious and huge they come on a big hot saute pan which completely kill the hole upscale dinner experience in my opinion.
I mean here we are sitting with this really nice dinner on a beautiful set table and the they bring out two big sauté pans and leave them there on the middle on the table personally I would recommend the sides to be plated on a nice side dish patle or some kind of small cast iron plate but that's just me.
Over all our experience here was amazing and the food was great along with really nice and friendly staff and professionall service.< /Text>

Most overrated restaurant and dining experience in SF. I had high hopes for Mastro’s. They have some serious kinks to work out in this restaurant. I have never waited so long (nearly an hour) for a table when a reservation was booked in advance. It took 30 minutes to get drinks after we put our order in at the bar while waiting. By the time we got seated and our orders came, we literally spent 3.5 hours in this place and we were only 2 people. And the most peculiar thing is apparently the VIP bread basket is the most exclusive item on their menu. It literally took 30 minutes before we finally got a bread basket, despite my multiple check-ins.

Management has not spent enough time educating their staff on the menu or the wine list.

The ambience was almost like walking into the set of a ghetto music video. Why is the music so loud and obnoxious? Why does the decor look like a high end brothel? For such an expensive restaurant, this place has ZERO CLASS and poor ambiance.

The only positives here were our table server had a lovely personality. Unfortunately, poor management and operational inefficiencies make her job very hard.

Food wise, I don’t find the product worth the price. I ordered a fillet medium rare. It was ok at best. It was dry, had no tenderness, and was over-salted. The Brussel sprouts tasted like the grass growing in my backyard with some salt poured over it. There was so much cream in the mashed potatoes, I thought I had drank an entire gravy boat after two bites.

Drink wise, if you’re going to charge $20+ for a cocktail on the rocks, use a single clear ice cube. That is standard at most cocktail bars when ordering an old fashioned or similar cocktail. Mastro’s used the same ice in the cocktails as their water glasses.

Additionally, the design is poorly done. For a massive two story restaurant, there should be a bathroom available on each level. Also, at this price point there should be valet parking.

Every steakhouse in SF is better than this one, including your own house with a cut of grocery chain store meat on the grill.

Save your time and  money. Go elsewhere.< /Text>< Pics>

Service slow, too dark, food had basic flavors. At that price point it needs to have its own distinctive taste.<//Review>

Ordered combo pad thai which was super tasty with a good mix of protein options and a heft portion of noodles to deliver outstanding value. Also ordered the green papaya salad which was quite tasty as well. I wish it was a bit spicier but loved the fish sauce complex flavor. Overall it was very light and refreshing with the mint leaves. Easy to pickup with a nice loading zone right in front.< /text>

<Time>1608985963280<//Time><Rating>4</Rating><text>Currently there is only take-out service. We tried this place for lunch today as we were already picking up an order from our fav bakery, Misfit Bakehouse two doors over.

There is a table at the doorway and you have to yell across to the owner/hostess? at the far end of the restaurant who is wearing a mask. So very challenging to hear what she was saying. Anyhoo, we went through way to many verbal exchanges sorting out our order. But patience to pay off in the end.

We ordered Chicken basil with Rice lunch special (missing the spring roll the menu mentions) and the Eggplant lunch special with the $3 addition of shrimp added (again - missing spring roll) Total for two dishes was a tad under $28.

But dang - they do give you a boatload of rice and the main dish. We had plenty for 3-4 people from these two lunches. Service was prompt - it took less than about 10 minutes and was piping hot and fresh.

My eggplant and shrimp had a bit of heat and plenty of garlic. Very satisfying. The chicken dish was ok - but I found the meat a bit dry. Lots of bamboo slices? and nice fresh basil.

Definitely worth coming back to try more items. I'd recommend placing our order over the phone to avoid the shouting order exchange :)< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I thought I’d try this place so I’ve ordered and eaten two entrees. Pad thai - it was meh. Mussaman Beef - I was hungry but ate it anyways. This is truly my honest opinion:  The food needs more flavoring. The mussaman needs cube beef (like their menu says) and not strips of beef. It needed to be more peanutty flavor. Am disappointed and dissatisfied. Good location but food needs improvement.<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< pics>

Tried this restaurant this evening and it was terrible. The Pad Se Ew was disgusting. Barely any vegetables, over cooked noodles, and chicken tasted very old. Sour shrimp soup was basically hot water with oil, over-cooked shrimp, zero vegetables, and mushrooms.  No flavor at all in this food.

It was prepared in 5 minutes and tasted like it.

These 2 dishes cost $27 - ridiculous. They want you to pay cash. Sketchy.

I don’t think this is a Thai/Vietnamese restaurant, more hidden Chinese.</text>

I'm Asian, the name is IndoChine so I thought it's Indonesian Chinese food. But the menu had Thai, Chinese, Malay fusioned food. The spicy food isn't really spicy for Asians (might be for white/light flavor food people or whoever can't handle spices) so I could see why someone could expect spicy but the food isn't.
However for Palo Alto, the value and price and service, are all very reasonable and quality.i think it should be at least 4.3 stars. Hence giving it a 5 to average it up (:</review>< Resp>

<Review>This place is fine - the food isn’t repulsive or anything like that. It’s just fine. The problem is: unless you go for the lunch special it really is not worth the price. If you’re paying north of 16-17 for food, just make the trek downtown. Even the lunch special at 13.03 isn’t very worth it.< /Review>< name>

<text>Solidly good. Had dumplings, lemongrass chicken, a ride noodle chicken dish, and some kind of warm beef salad (my wife ordered). All of it was good, and about right for the price.

We come here with some frequency, haven't been disappointed yet!</text>< Pics>

Solid spot. Food is fresh, large portions, and authentic flavors. They do a huge take-out business, so my only ding is for slow-ish service. That said, the service is VERY good and the staff are lovely. Great neighborhood spot.</review>

Indochine is my favorite Middletown stop for dinner 😋
Two of my favorite food types (Thai and Vietnamese) offered in the same restaurant!
What a beautiful pairing 👌
Last night I ordered the Chef's Special, seafood combo, served in an amazing spicy coconut sauce with vegetables and a side of rice 🍲🍚
Delicious!<//review>

Did a large take out order, all great and on time. Very generous portions, surprisingly so, and great tasty Thai curries. Definitely good, above what I'd expect for the price (it's a relatively inexpensive place, especially for Palo Alto).</Review>

This is a very nice place. However, I feel the food is more Chinese than Thai. The flavor is on the sweet and salty side but they don't over do it. The portion is good too. Price is just right in the area. It's a very good choice for lunch. (Has lunch special)</review>

Excellent red curry with duck. Arrived as they were closing at 9pm and they let us order take out. Perfect blend of sweet (pineapple chunks and raisins) and spicy (curry plus jalapeños). Definitely worth a visit.< /Text>

Have to rate this five-stars for the immense lunch-menu value ($10-$11) - who can find anything around Palo Alto for that price? And the food is consistently good and a generous portion. Recommended.</Review>

This is a small and cozy restaurant.  The dishes for the most part are Thai and Vietnamese.  My grilled pork with vermicelli was fine, but not the best or flavorful I've had.  Even though it wasn't too crowded during lunch, the service is pretty slow due to the fact they're clearly understaffed.  I even saw a party waiting to be greeted, only to walk out of the restaurant.< /text>

Beware of online pickup ordering. Service adds extra 2.00 fee without obvious ability to change. Adds extra cost to add more protein even if that is not what you are wanting. Staff fought me blaming the ordering app instead of making it right for 2.00.</Text>

<Text>this place usually only has one wait person to assist all the tables so expect to stay there for at least an hour especially during lunch.

<Text>The food was a bit raw and the menu is misleading. Furthermore, server was mean to us. The second star is for their Thai iced tea which was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this place and probably won't come back.</Text>< Pictures>

This place used to be a favorite Thai restaurant for me and my buddies but, ever since the change of ownership, it hasn't been the same. I mean you expect these subtle changes from time to time, but some of the food items are prepared differently from what we were accustomed to. Specifically the Panang Chicken and Beef Mussuman. The meat and chicken portions are smaller than before. Oh well,  I guess gotta find a new Thai favorite then.< /Text>

Superb. Their service is fantastic and you get great food for a good price... You even get chocolate cake thrown in with the lunch special.

<Review>I can't understand why people eat here.  I've been here twice and the second time was only the result of  my having forgotten my promise to myself never to return after my first visit.  The second time was bad enough that I'm writing this review to increase the odds that I remember not to return.

Its just disappointing to get food that's so bland with so little effort made.  I ordered Pad Thai and it was basically noodles with orange food coloring and some thinly sliced pieces of chicken spread through it.  Come on Indochine!  This isn't rocket science, its Pad Thai.

I don't understand why people continue to eat here.  I don't think the people who work here are mean-spirited and so I feel a bit bad about slamming them so hard, but I just paid $60 for 3 entrees and one appetizer and the best of them might have reached the bottom rung of mediocre.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Lunch hour is hectic. They are short on staffs to clean the tables and take care of customers' request. I ordered brown rice but got steam white rice instead. They did charge me for brown rice though. The lady at cashier was impatient and literally threw me 4 quarters...</Review>

The delivery line was awfully long and they served everybody there first, resulting in a very long wait to get only a Pad Thai. Very annoying<//review>

I was initially treated well until I asked for some help installing or showing me how to install my new windshield wipers and I was initially told that was not their job and insurance would not allow it. Very Snarky, then a very nice person installed them for me. I later found out he was a driver and worked on his car alot. Changed my entire view and feelings about the store.
Thank you to David.</review>

Needed a new battery for my 2014 Nissan Rogue. Help with selection and installation of the battery so I would not have to come back with the old one. Ssved me my time which is more than money. Great staff and great service.< /text>

Good selection, great prices. I bought a starter and I've had to return it twice. It couldn't have been easier to do. It was a lifetime warranty,  but still at other stores, there's always issues. Not at monument. I'll be shopping here from now on!< /review>

<Text>It is store which does not follow the rule to refund sold items. In my case I purchased the electronic car pump and it does not work as supposed to work in requirements and they declined to refund it because I tried to use in front of the store door. Do not recommend to buy anything from this store!</Text><gmapID>0x80850cae6fe1a37f:0xe899fdcbfc89de91< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The tacos were tasty, just forgot to add the cilatro we had asked for.  They were really busy when my husband and I stopped by so I kind of just let it go.  Otherwise it was good as usual.<//Review>

I couldn't even order food last night cause the cashier ladies if front didn't know anything i was saying, since i don't know spanish and gave me a blank look as i told them my order. I then knew i wasn't gonna get anywhere with it so i walked out upset and almost ready to ruin someone's day, I was already having a rough day.< /Review>

Of all of the la villas in Bakersfield, I must say this one is my least favorite, however it is the closest one to my home, so I continue to eat here because I enjoy their signature flavors.  this location has  fewer choices than the one on Union avenue and their choice of beef seems to have more fat here. I'm happy to see all of the employees wearing masks however the patrons aren't observing social distancing nor wearing masks.  No Pollo?!  Ahhh, not cool!  Anyway, I'm happy to see they're still in business, unlike the Papa Murphy's across the street.< /review>

This la Villa is hit or Miss but to be fair I only eat there (asada) Taco's and burritos for the most part, and I only gave it a 3 because some times the meats and tortillas are really dry and other times there perfect, The few times I've eaten there nachos I was really impressed<//review>

<text>Come here often for the past 10 plus years. Form menudo to tacos to the horchata. It's definitely my go to on the east side of Bakersfield for Mexican food. If I had any negative thing to say about La Villa, they "usually" give you your drink once the food is ready so if you're ordering to go, don't forget your drink! 😅 But that's not really that bad, more of a customer issue if you forget to ask for your drink since they usually prepare it as they put in your order with the cooks. Menudo is good here tho 🙌🏼👌🏼< /text>< pics>

I love eating here! I work nearby so I just walk over and order my favorites. I love ordering their taco combos, asada fries, tortas and burritos. My lunch breaks are thirty minutes and when I walk in and order, I always have time to eat it before the thirty minutes are up. Fast, great service and very welcoming. Always hits the spot!< /review>

The food was enjoyed by all. They honored our requests for how we wanted the food, as I just wanted a chili verdi burrito with only chili verdi. Some places have told me they cannot do this, really?
The other items were great also.</text>

It's a good place for a Very Mexican food. However there is no soap and no hot water and no paper towels in the bathroom. I saw several small Roaches on their backs in the bathroom I really hoped there were none in the kitchen. The workers we're very stone-faced and not friendly at all and we probably won't go back there.<//Text>

The food is good, but honestly their treat to customers suck. Since the moment I walked in i felt a dirty luck from the ladies at the register, they treat you as if they are giving you the food for free. The ladies that work at the register look as if they don’t want to work there. I understand that this is not a very customer friendly place, but my god they just treat you as if they hate you. 😪👎🏼</Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>i love this place but things has changed and  it's has been going on for to long now. everytime I come they always serve old hard  meat from the night before with fresh meat. it doesn't matter what time I come or what I order chicken or carne Asda it's the same. it's sad becuz urs omw of my favorite places to eat since a kid and I feel.like its lost its original touch and lost the respect and appreciation of loyal customers!! i hope this changes in the near  future.

Food is always great. My favorite is the asada burrito and a horchata. Inside is dingy looking, but I'm only there for the food and not the decor. Food comes out pretty quickly and is decently priced though they do charge for use of card.<//text>

Great place to eat, people are friendly. You have some games to play while you wait ( normally a five minute wait (depending on how many customers are there)).< /Text>

I went to la villa and the open sign was on still so obviously it means it’s open I went inside waited about 5 minutes in line and then a lady said we are closed now. I went at 11:35pm and it says online that you guys close at 12:00am so I don’t know why they didn’t attend me. Oh and also there was still people in the restaurant<//Review>
