Had a plumbing emergency late last night and he showed up rather quickly to help us out. He was professional and courteous! He came to my home, was mindful of not letting my cats out and did everything in his power to fix my problem. Unfortunately my plumbing issues were extensive but he fixed what he could by going through the roof rather than completely tearing apart my bathroom and leaving me screwed until we hear back from the landlord. If you’re on here Charlie, I just want to say THANK YOU MAN and I hope you and your supervisor are the ones to return if my landlord approves the issue!!!!< /text>< Resp>

Charles is a very knowledgable technician.
He is also very courteous and easy to talk with.
He informed me of the potential mess that would be created on my back patio while snaking the drain that was clogged.
When he was finished he cleaned everything up to the point that you could barely tell he was even there.
All in all, super great job and person !!!!< /text>

Victor is a very nice young man. He arrived in the time frame he said he would be here. Victor is very professional, clean and diagnostic skills are excellent! Knew exactly how to fix my toilet. Very clean job. He is an asset to your company! I will recommend his services to my family and friends<//Text>

He saved us time and money, by being honest about a refrigerator leak that is likely just within the unit itself. He made sure the water line valve was turned off, and did not charge the elderly home owner, as no repairs were done, but the homeowner was grateful that he came out.<//review>< pictures>

Big job today.  Charlie worked hard putting in and cleaning a drain.  Brian explained everything in detail to my satisfaction.  Everything was great,  just expensive.  They have a company to support so cost is going to be higher.  But you get what you pay for.  I was very happy with their work.< /text>

I was in a bind and did not expect anyone would be able to come out for a few days or more. I was completely surprised to hear they would be out here this very day. They were here in less than 2 hours. Victor Cortez was my technician and he could not have been more courteous. He was friendly, cleanly and got right to work. He put down his own pads & cloths after picking up my rugs to keep them clean & dry. I have never seen anyone in the service industry take such care. He got my problem fixed and he cleaned up & replaced my rugs. After a short time preparing the bill & getting payment arranged he wished me well and was on his way to his next appointment. I am very happy to give Victor a perfect grade and will definitely call for his service again if needed. I will recommend your company as well. The lady in the office was also prompt and very helpful. She was courteous and very prompt in communication with my sister. I think her name is Melissa. Thank you for an excellent experience!!

I didn’t have to wait days to get service, they were here within 2 hours of my call.  They explained everything that needed to be done and the cost.

Garrett came by, fixed our leak! Showed up really fast. Cool guy. Only thing, i felt price was a little pricey. But since i called two other plumbing business prior to Roto-Rooter and they couldn’t come out until the next day, and Garrett was able to come out with in the hour! Worth it, in the end.. thanks</review>

<Text>My master bathroom was flooded by water backing up and coming into bathroom from under my toilet. The flange was rusted and also needed  to replace the closet bend.
We're on septic so that was also checked.
A faucet was also replaced outside that was always leaking. The job was done very clean and the boys were very respectful towards our home. The job cost us $2200 but we were able to pay it back interest free applying for credit through them. 👌☺<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Hello, Charles was the technician who showed up to clean out our clogged toilet. I have gone through this a few times in the past and knew exactly where the main clean out was located. Charles suited up and cleaned out the drain. Then Brian showed up and did a complementary camera to double check the line and see what was going on.
Roto-Rooter was more expensive that I expected, but they came quick, did the job and quoted us for some preventative maintenance. I do recommend this company.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Hugo was great. Couldn't ask for a nicer, courteous, considerate plumber.  I'm concerned over the $750 I was charged by Marcus for replacing a kitchen faucet.  I've been told that was excessive and I knew it but was desperate to get this done as it dripped constantly.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Had a problem with my toilet, they were out the same day, said I needed a new toilet, and put it in the same day.  Charlie did an amazing job getting it put in and left my bathroom nice and clean, and I am very glad I called you guys.  Thank you!</review>< Resp>

<Review>After I called and explained my situation they said they would send out a tech to look for no charge and the. He will quote me a price, I explained they we already used a few option to clear the drain and were unsuccessful so he said 250$ to clear it I told him. No thanks everyone else advertises 79-99$ then we agreed on $120 since he was here and I just wanted it done. Then after 10 minutes of trying the method I already told him I tried he came back and said he needs to remove the toilet and it would be 200$ I said ok go ahead. Then at the end he told me 320$ so they still expected me to pay the original 120$ for a method I told him I tried and he only tried for 10 mins I would definitely not call them back< /Review><Name>kyle nicholls< /Name><userid>111898279547365714252< /userid>< resp>

<Review>Unable to clear drain. Claimed it needed to come thru roof and it was a mainline issue.  300 just to go on roof.  Landlord called local plumber and it was cleared in 15 minutes using same snake and entry port.  Will never call roto rooter again. Used to be good but now it seems like they just want Mooney money and no guarantee they. Can fix it. Talked about cameras and digging up yard. Ridiculous.<//Review>< Pics>

Joe the technician was assigned to help with my plumbing needs. He was very knowledgeable and identified the issue with my clogged toilet drain. He explained the problem was with the cast iron clean out fitting used for construction. The cast iron fitting is rough on the inside and after time, calcium build up can shrink the internal diameter of the fitting. This can promote waste build up. He was able to clear the clog in the pipe, however, I will need to replace the clean out fitting in the near future. Overall my experience with Joe and Roto-Rooter was excellent.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>While the plumbers were very nice, they said that my water heater needed a new pilot assembly to the tune of $735 and it would take a week to get the part in.  Not wanting to face the prospect of a week's worth of cold showers I called a local company for a second opinion.  The local company was at my house within 5 minutes of my phone call, replaced the thermocouple, which they had in-stock, and 20 minutes later my water heater worked perfectly - to the tune of only $143.

Would not recommend.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I called about 6:20am coz when I got a call from the downstairs tenants who were experiencing back-up debris from the upstairs unit.  Obviously, there's urgency if you see feces overflowing from your toilet, which is out of your control.  The Roto Rooter associate (Palmer) told me that the techs are coming in at 8am; she never gave me any other options like using the night service for a fee.  So I  waited until around 9am to follow up; but the associate who answered the call  (I think Vicky) wasn't much of a help.  She just told me that my service request is queued and whoever is available will be assigned.  Mind you this is following up after more than 3 hrs since I placed the call.  At that time, I have decided to call other companies I have dealt with before who were more attentive to send someone with a timeline already, or who was willing to go right after finishing up a job.  Shortly after that follow-up call with Roto Rooter, I was told that Hugo is on his way and about an hour away.  Finally, after almost half of the day is gone just waiting, Hugo finally came.  He is personable, friendly, and seems knowledgeable of his trade.  I explained to him my frustration with the unresponsiveness and lack of attention and compassion to this urgent need.  Although the estimate was higher than what I was charged by another top plumbing company before, I've decided to have the job done considering I dont have much time because it was wasted just waiting to assign this work-order to a tech.  Also, their office is located in Hemet and so the equipment like the camera and the hydrojetting machine was another time wasted waiting.  The job was finally done by 5pm, which I think could have been done effectively and efficiently within 2 hrs.  Though I was sold with using the camera and hydrojetting it just to prevent future issues, the camera was used only for few minutes and taken by the supervisor (Gerry) before the hydrojetting started.  For the fee I paid I shd have gotten a better service, and considering I have a comparison of how the other plumbing company use camera before and after hydrojetting job.  This leaves a bad impression.  There's more I could say, but I'll stop here.

However, I have to say that Roto Rooter's profile of the techs they're sending is impressive.  The cost of it must be factored in the service fee they're charging.☹</review>< gmap_id>

Matt came to my home on time and was extremely helpful with my plumbing needs. He examined the area of concern, then explained in detail the issue and what needed to be done to fix it. Thank you Matt and Roto-Rooter for taking on my plumbing nightmare and fixing it. I definitely recommend them.</review>

It was fast service and the customer service representaive was very nice but I can;t give this place more than 2 stars because the technician did not complete his job.  He charged us $230 and finished his job in about 10 minutes.  He then took off after I handed him his check and he didn't even cove up the hole that was dug for drain access. He just left the trench open.  I was not happy to have paid so much money for him to be done in 10 minutes and then just leave without finishing.</Text>

I had them go to a rental I manage that had a stopped up drain in a bathtub.  They would not give me a price prior to arriving.  They said they would give me and estimate after checking the problem.  They called me and said it would be $78 which seemed ok.  I gave them my credit card for payment and thought everything was good.  Later when I got my credit card statement they had charged $178.  I called to talk to them about it and was told the manager Gary Ramos would call me back.  He never did. This job took them about a half hour. That is the time between the first call with the estimate and a follow up call telling me the job was done.  I may have miss heard the estimate but $178 for 30 minute job  is really expensive.  Be careful with these guys</text>

I've had so much trouble with septic clogs that I finally decided to call a plumber instead of septic people.  I asked this company to find the cause of the numerous clogs instead of just clearing it out.

First thing Joe T. did was clear the clog so he could get to the reason I was having so much trouble.  Took Joe just a few minutes to get things flowing and then he was on to the cause.

I had 4 major reasons for the problems I had been having for so long.  Joe T. fixed the main line with better plumbing, thoroughly inspected the line with a camera and then he "shot" everything out so it was very clean.  He also installed a clean-out (that I've never had) so from now on there will be no need to open the septic for a clog.  I don't imagine I'll ever even have to have someone get into the clean-out either now that all has been repaired.

Joe T. is a very knowledgeable, hard-working plumber who wastes no time.  I would recommend him and his company to anyone and I will consider him my plumber from now on.</review>

<Review>Joseph Treat was my technician, he was professional and did everything he could to unclog my irrigation drain. The cards were just not in our favor, after pulling a whole lot of roots we just couldn't get it. "Let me try one more time" went on for about a hour, just too many palm tree roots and crushed piping. Thanks anyway< /Review>< rate>

If I could give a zero I would. I called for an estimate informed dispatcher and plumber Hugo. He did the work anyways without consent! No signature to start or anything. We didn't know until he demanded payment as I rushed home to understand the situation. He was informed and so was the roto rooter dispatcher. The estimate was for my landlord that wanted a full quote on what needed to be done. We did not ask for the services to be done nor wanted the services done at that time which diapatcher said we could schedule an appt once we got word from the landlord. I called immediately after Hugo stole from us bc that's what it was!! It has been over 40 hours and no call back as i have contacted them 7 times with no success of actually reaching a manager. Also any company that refuses to give you a corporate number is ridiculous. I'm talking to Vicki on that one! They can cash my check within 24 hours, but can't call me back, give the actual estimate (bc that still was not given as there was much more work needing ro be done), or show any sign of customer service. I'm glad I work at a Home Improvement store. That way when i give my local remmendations, which I do multiple times daily, I can automatically say "STAY AWAY FROM ROTO ROOTER"</Review>

Very Disappointed!!!!  I call them out to clear the main line for my toilet that I had already removed for access.  They charge me $775 to clear the line and don't even put the toilet back on.  They left my wife and kids with no running water and no toilet.  Interesting customer service.  Had one job to do, FIX MY TOILET.  I guess I should have stayed home from work and fixed it myself.
Thanks Matt and Rich.  You just lightened your potential work load.  I'll drive my car through the house before I'll ever call you again.</text>

<Date>1404516329854<//Date><rating>5< /rating><text>Allan Graber repaired our main water line which had a leak under the driveway as it turned out. It took a considerable amount of digging and chasing just to locate the leak. The original installer took an unconventional route apparently to avoid breaking up several large rocks that Allan had to contend with and remove just to discover the location. Following several trips to Home Depot to acquire the proper fittings and
installation tools, the leak was repaired in short order. The line started out as a one inch copper line from the meter and appeared to end at the home entrance as the same size line. (Not!) It was a PEX  flex line several inches under the driveway. I might add that this was a hot and humid day on July 4th. Despite several large obstacles (Big Rocks!) Alan never complained and got us back in business.<//text>< pictures>

The phone answerer, Bridgette, asked only a few questions about what needed fixing, a bathtub faucet leaking problem. The questions seemed only relevant to their own need to provide us with a quick response to get the job done well, and within that call she said Roto-Rooter could have a plumber there within an hour. She had a very friendly manner in her voice and personality. I told her many found our residence hard to locate, so advised her to tell the person coming to fix the leaking faucets to call me when he got to the nearest well known street intersection. It was a pleasant surprise to hear his phone call to me within 30 minutes, then I got in my little car and met him to escort the Roto-Rooter truck to our ranch, and our permanent foundation modular house, a Champion made in 1988. Roto Rooter had replaced all of the plastic water pipes circa 1995 with copper pipes and stainless steel flex cables to almost every outlet. This has made the house almost trouble free since then. The plumber arrived smiling and totally ready to go to work. He took apart the ailing old tub valve stems, showed my wife and I how they'd disintegrated over time since the manufacture of the house. He was almost immediately able to come up with an exact price of what the fix would cost. Returning from a run to town to get the parts, he took out a much larger box of tools, and he did the replacing of both valves with brand new ones taking about 15 minutes (he had gone to town to find the somewhat unusual modular house parts). Allen, the plumber, had accepted a root beer I'd given him since the day was so hot, but upon leaving I noticed he had left the big glass half full, so intent he had been upon fixing our problem quickly. He and I worked together to adjust the rubber seals, me turning the house water supply valve on and off quickly for his adjusting in the tub, and my wife even gave him an old grommet she had from where she works that proved helpful. The complete professionalism of Roto-Rooter in doing everything they said they would do, and doing it fast caused me in saying goodby to Allen, "Thanks for the fast fix and the high competence of your work." Working with them was actually fun, since every other plumbers we had called seemed almost afraid of doing modular and mobile home cases.< /review>

Had a broker later line in my second home in Hemet. Called "7" plumbers who advertised 24/7 plumbing service. Five of these companies made "excuses" of why they could not come out that night at 12 midnight. The 6th company said they had a man already out in the field and he would not be finished for "at least" 2 hours and it might have to wait till the morning. We called two of the Roto Router Offices trying to locate a plumber and the answering service noted that both of our calls were for the same address (indicating they have a good tracking system), The answering service lady indicated she would call the service man on call and get back to me "shortly" in about 10 minutes. Sure enough ten minutes late Joe T. called and asked questions about the problem, size of the broke pipe (to be sure he had parts in the truck) or he would had to run to the service center to pick up parts. I explain the problem, gave him the measurement of the pipe size (attempted to take a photo but it was too wet and dark even with a flash). He said he would come out and should arrive in about 15 minutes. HE ARRIVED IN 15 MINUTES.
As it turned out Joe T. is the "supervisor" and the man on call was not there and this was the third night in a row that Joe T. went out for somebody else. He was very polite, pleasant, knowledgeable and quick to diagnose the problem. They was a time delay due to my lot unfortunately did not have a water shut off value from the street. An unfortunate complication, we had looked and so did the the subdivision manager and grounds manager before we even called the plumber. So the entire subdivision water had to be shut down. Once that was completed Joe T. Fixed the problem in about 15 minutes. The bill was slightly expense, but for the time of night and quick response, it was "very reasonable". This excellent rating is mainly because of this companies good backup supervisor who really deserves the credit. If he wasn't there for backup, this might be an entirely different review. Yeah Joe T. REALLY GOOD JOB!
So if you call Roto Rooter in Hemet and you can't get the main service guy, be sure to tell them you wish to speak with Joe T.<//Text>

< Review>
If zero Stars was an option that's what I would put Joe took forever to get to her house I had to call Roto Rooter three times to be told that he would be here in 20 minutes which each time took almost an hour once he got here he was very rude when I pointed out that the bathroom is where the smell was coming from he imply that it might be coming from my house very rude walked right outside to his truck and said nothing WORST SERVICE EVER NEVER AGAIN!!< /Review>

My Tax Analyst ( Reinhard Wolf ) - Is very Knowledgable and Bright: I would Recommend His Services to My Friend's and Let a Few of My Family Member's - Contact Him for Advice, or the Prep. of Their Taxes: - He is Funny and Is a Very Dedicated Individual - Who know's all about the Current Tax Law's:</Review>

The reason I keep coming back to H&R is because of my tax preparer Reinhart Wolf... extremely knowledgeable and capable.  I’ll only come back as long as he is there.</review>

<Response>None</Response><text>It’s unfortunate that I have to write this review it was a good place, but when I first took my dog to them they didn’t require any paperwork, but today I had a terrible experience over the phone. I’ve taken my dog the last two times and they didn’t ask me anything! I would’ve gotten the right paperwork if they needed it, but they told me it wasn’t required the last two times I’ve been. Then on top of that they couldn’t “find” my last two visits nor did they find my name. Shows how much they value customers doesn’t it? Don’t recommend it unless you wanna be given the run around and be told the opposite of what they told you.<//text><Rating>1< /Rating><gmapID>0x80c2c5fe7018d12f:0x2234532361ebfae2</gmapID>< Name>

First time here after a couple of bad experiences at other grooming stores.    This will be our new go to place. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating to our last minute request for nail trimming for our three pugs. They were very patient with our challenging nervous older mail pug. A great experience for us all. We will be back!<//Text>

<Review>I used to take my dog Booboo there for over 15 years and used to pay $70.00 for bath, flea dip and nail clipping. Now they want $120.00. I told the lady it was nice doing business with you but that is way more than I would ever pay to give my dog a bath. I'll just do it myself and take my wife out to a very, very nice restaurant with that money instead.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c5fe7018d12f:0x2234532361ebfae2< /gmap_id></record>

Wasn't even my dog's first time but , it was definitely was the last after walking in and looking at the prices ! EXPENSIVE. Ladies Petco only cots $40 base price for bathing and grooming plus other additional services. This grooming place is right for you if u just found a dog and don't have the vaccine records as needed for Petco.<//text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) WARNING !! DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG TO THIS GROOMER!
I was looking for a simple nail clip. I was in the area and found this place (I should have read the reviews).

They took my dog ​​inside and told me to wait for 10 min. The lady that attended me kept coming outside to meet with people (her family I believe) and she kept telling me "just one more min". 30 minutes passed and no sign of my dog. I called and asked her to take the dog even if she did not clip the nails.

I could not believe what I saw when they brought my dog ​​out. His nails were not only poorly clipped, but bleeding! In the picture, you can see the amount of the yellow powder they put to avoid the bleed.

When I confronted the lady, she told me "this is normal" - "all dogs bleed". I understand the bleeding of one or two nails, but ALL OF THEM? come on !! My dog ​​is now limping and unable to walk.

No-one has ever made my dog ​​bleed! ever!

I refused to pay, because the basic condition for this service is to 1. have nails properly clipped and 2. avoid injury to a dog - and both of these basic conditions were not met. The lady that attended me followed me to my car and kept recording me. I was harassed and threatened.

Believe me when I say that this was by far the worst service I have ever experienced in my life!

EN ESPANOL:

¡¡ADVERTENCIA!! ¡NO LLEVE SU PERRO CON ESTE PELUQUERO DE PERROS!
Estaba buscando una simple cortada de uñas. Estaba en la zona y encontré este lugar (debería haber leído las críticas).

Llevaron a mi perro adentro y me dijeron que esperara 10 minutos. La señora que me atendía seguía saliendo para encontrarse con gente (creo que su familia) y me decía "solo un minuto más". Pasaron 30 minutos y no había rastro de mi perro. La llamé y le pedí que sacara a mi perro aunque no las uñas no hayan sido cortadas.

No podía creer lo que vi cuando sacaron a mi perro. ¡Sus uñas no solo estaban mal cortadas, sino que también sangraban! En la imagen se puede ver la cantidad de polvo amarillo que ponen para evitar el sangrado.

Cuando me enfrenté a la señora, me dijo "esto es normal" - "todos los perros sangran". Entiendo el sangrado de una o dos uñas, ¿pero TODAS? Mi perro ahora cojea y no puede caminar.

¡Nadie ha hecho sangrar a mi perro! ¡nunca!

Me negué a pagar porque la condición básica para este servicio es 1. tener las uñas bien cortadas y 2. evitar lesiones a un perro, y estas dos condiciones básicas no se cumplieron. La señora que me atendía me siguió hasta mi coche y me siguió grabando. Me acosaron y me amenazaron.

¡Créame cuando digo que este fue el peor servicio que he experimentado en mi vida!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBaozuMVNt_lri_IuUfwmFCZ12PTOIagnX6ksS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

At $28 for dinner for a large order of meat (not all you can eat) but unlimited vegetables is still pretty good and full out the door with leftovers to bring home.

First time seeing self-serve soup base sauce in a squeeze bottle. Come to think of it, I’m sure most Shabu Shabu places does exactly the same, except the chef in the kitchen does it on your behalf, out of sight, to make you feel it’s freshly cooked. I actually like controlling the salt and flavor level on demand.

Brown/red rice was too hard though. Not that good.
I like the sample sauce presentation to help you decide which you want.

Satisfying meal, no complaints, except definitely come in prepared to spending some $$.

Restroom was clean, restaurant well lit and well maintained.</review><Time>1541493239521</Time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I got the $20 Joon beef and the meat quality was good. I would give 5 stars for the meat quality but 2.5 stars for veggies (my carrots were so not fresh and only so little variety) and 0.5 star for the service (server never came to check on us.. ).
For the broth, they just give you water and that's it. They have two bottles of sauces on the table and the server said one is for meat flavor and the other is for spicy flavor.. didn't seem like they were real tho.. i like shabu with real broth, not just water with the "flavor" you add from a bottle..
Anyway they give you 4 options for the sauce and get to pick two.
I think there are so many better shabu places out there for what you can get.< /Text>< pictures>

I love Joon shabu. Their first location in Glendale is really great, too. I get their Sichuan soup with ponzu and sweet soys dipping sauce. They have a secret spicy sauce you have to ask for. 👍< /text>

Tried this place a day after opening and it was excellent. We got the opening special which included 3 types of meat: wagyu, rib-eye and something else. All of them were excellent cuts, especially the rib-eye. Generous portions of vegetables. The sauces were all great and unique. Will definitely return!</review>

Definitely regretting coming here. It was my first time and you spend quite a bit of money for so little food. To top it off, you have to spend additional for the broth.
It truly isn't party friend here. Party of 6 with 2 shareable 14 oz ribeye plus the broth will come out to almost $100.
You can get more for your money at an all your can eat shabu place for a little less than this place.< /Text>

Never giving my business to this place. We arrived at 9:15pm and the hours of operation listed on the website and the front door states open till 10pm. We walked in and noticed two employees standing at the back shaking their heads while looking  at us. One came over and and stated that they were "closed". When we confronted him about the listed hours he said that these were weekend hours....yeah ok sure, it's probably because you don't want to be working there and want to close early. Very rude, and the employees should want to work. Two paying customers who's repeat business has been lost.< /text>

Great atmosphere but the quality of meat falls short for the price. Vegetables and black rice are nice. Place is clean and servers are great. Still rather go to slice or California shabu.</Review>

Is Shabu Shabu worth $25? It's definitely not my everyday lunch budget but when the occasions come, that $25 should be worth a lot of excitement. I didn't feel like there was much to get excited about at Joon Shabu 2 - the food was good, service was okay, but nothing really stood out to make me want to come back. I would still default to my long-time favorite Dada for group lunches, where we can all drown our feelings in unlimited soup and devour all types of meats and seafoods for the same cost.

My boyfriend and I shared a Tonkotsu broth with 10oz Australian lamb.
We ordered a large one-person meal because we weren't hungry enough to get a Shared entree (14oz meat, 2 servings of vegetables, $40 price tag). I thought the Tonkotsu broth smelled better than it tasted because the flavor tasted pretty weak. The meat was good, and I really liked dipping it in the sesame/goma sauce which I wish was less diluted. My favorite part of the meal was the red rice. It was the perfect texture, and it was so good I could've just ate that alone and called it a day.

The service was friendly, although kind of slow. Since we had a large group, it's hard to get everyone served at the same time. It was also weird that half our table got our bills processed and we had to wait another few minutes for the rest of our party get their bills before we could leave.<//review>

<Text>While the food was amazing the service was awful. We were a party of five and had to swap around the sauses and plates we got as they kept forgetting what we ordered, we had 4 different wait staff ask about the check, the metal chop sticks they had couldn't get even a slight grip on the foodand my stove top kept turning off. My food (raw meat) would stop cooking because the heat would turn off, luckily I saw all my friends pots boiling constantly so I realized something was wrong with mine. They ending up having me simply move my food to the side (3-6 inches) so they could literally cut the rubber epoxy away from the stove top, pull it up, and switch it back on. I'm not blaming anyone for the fact that the stove did not work, that's not the waiters fault, but I can tell you the little chunks of plastic all around boiling water is definitely not proper food safety.

There are plenty of other shabu shabu, don't go here.</Text><date>1535347294641< /date>< user_name>

We walked in at 5:15pm and was told they open at 5:30pm. Asked if We could sit and wait since it was 110 degrees outside, and was told no they are still getting ready.  Walked next door to Luna Rosa.  First impression is everything, not sure if we will ever be back.<//review>

Beautiful views, modern play structure, skate park, and easy parking make this park a great option for those in the Tri Valley area. Hike around the rolling hills and ponds, or picnic by the swing sets and climbing structures. We went on a Saturday and only one other family was there. Great bike paths. Very clean facilities.</text>

Nice secluded park with plenty of parking.  Only thing that sucks is that there's no slides at all or baby friendly swing.  It's just for older kids.<//Review>

<Review>The skatepark here is a nice place for a beginner to practice. At least for now, it is very un-crowded and when I have gone I have been the only one there. It has some simple obstacles and things to grind on, but admittedly I'm just trying to learn how to roll up and down the variable surfaces. I gave it four stars because the skatepark portion doesn't have any significant lighting, which was annoying for skating after the sun set.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>The play equipment is innovative and unique and geared to older kids (7+). However the single ramp mini skate / scooter park is really disappointing. It is a complete waste of tax payer money. I am surprised that the city of San Ramon can spend $40m to build itself a new palatial city hall but can’t seem to find money to build decent skate parks in Windermere (this area has a huge Melo roos tax surcharge as well) I agree with whoever put up this graffiti that this skate park needs to be added to More high school and middle school kids would  hang out here if this scooter / skate park is expanded. All the older kids here have to go to Emerald skate park in Dublin as even SR’s central skate park (next to the $40million monstrosity)  is quite small. The park and Rec officials need to expand this skate park urgently as the neighbourhood kids are now growing up and entering. Middle and high school. I don’t want my kids hanging out with the Dublin skateboard park high school kids who all seem to be on high when they turn up at the park.<//text>< pictures>

<review>These people at the Norco shelter are amazing! From officer Sandoval (the boss?) to Terry to Ann and Faith, they are all super helpful and friendly.  Last time I called because there was a opposum in middle of the street and I wasn't sure if it was still alive. Officer Sandoval went looking for it, called me to follow up and gave me an update. They truly LOVE animals and do anything to help!< /review>< name>

<review>Wonderful experience with the employee's at the shelter. Stopped by Thursday 3/16 just to look around, you know how that goes. Saw little "Sweetie" and fell in love like everyone else. Found out, everyone interested, had to come back for a lottery on Saturday, 3/18 at 10:45AM to pick a # chip and then 11AM, the drawing. Myself and one other family showed up for drawing, they were from Temecula and my family from Menifee. Some how my number 13 was picked first and Sweetie went home with us. It was fair and the other family was very cordial. I was directed to go to Starlight Vet Clinic a block away to get a special deal since she was an adopted dog, and got her a micro-chip and a rabies shot both at a reduced rate, both done as a walk in. We love Sweetie and she is learning very quickly. Thank you everyone, all the dogs were taken such good care of, and the runs were so nice and clean both times I came and walked up and down looking at all the dogs. Please adopt, don't buy from Pet Stores. Save dog's that need your family.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdb1eTxCljifnLW_epBHCJRrUqykbHr_43pLLM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

Lady at the front was extremly rude to my wife. We had simply found a dog on the streets, spent three days during and after thankgiving to find this poor dogs owner. Finally had to just give it to Animal control. In which wanted to investigate my wife for doing this ladies job basicly, kept accusing my wife of being the owner... Tax dollars once again waisted on programs that allow criminals to continue to do wrong and upstanding citizens to pay for it.< /text>

Seemed nice. Way down at the end of the road in the hills. Only had three cats though and we were looking for kitties. But they also had dogs and geese and ducks and pigeons. And lots of squirrels running around the property.< /review>

I am so heartbroken that people working at a shelter could be so heartless and nasty toward people. I was in a bad situation and needed somewhere for a dog to go that I could not take back home. I can understand policies and technicalities.  I get that. But to be so blatantly rude to another person who is doing their best to keep an animal safe is just wrong. The woman went as far as to just assume by appearance alone that I was not from Norco.. If you say the words "I dont care.." in ANY context to someone who is trying to do the right thing. You are just a bad person and need to find a new career. NOT in customer service OR "helping" the community. I'm so disappointed with them...<//Text>

<text>My sweet 14 year old dog, who had been ill for a while, told me he was 'ready to go' this morning.  After calling around receiving quotes from $468 to $169 - I called Norco Animal Shelter where the fee was only $57.  Officer Sparks and all the staff were so kind and sympathetic to my loss.  Thank you for making a tough day a little less tough.</text>< UserId.>

The staff are helpful and resourceful.  They wait a week before adopting out the dogs for health check, they spay and neuter all adopted pets which takes about 1-2 days after adopting.  Dogs here are very loveable.  They give all the dogs names instead of numbers.  Most of the dogs here are strays.  Some of them were surrendered by owner.< /Review>

We are looking for a dog to replace our dog we got from this shelter over 10 years ago. Very helpful and concerned people working at shelter. We always  donate some money when we visit. Yes, this is a prod for you to the same if you are able.</Review>

I adopted a dog named sugar. I changed her name to Daisey she is the sweetest dog. She is very loving and she was potted trained when I got her. She is a great addition to the family.< /review>

We found a dog on the road and thought we were doing the right thing by bringing it to the shelter.  Apparently they are not taking stays on Sunday's and if we were to leave it there we would be cited with animal abandonment.  Wish some people would just do their job.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>The people there are incredibly rude and disrespectful. THEY DON'T LOVE ANIMALS!!!  I found a dog on the street on the boarder of Norco and Riverside.   I took the dog 2 minutes down the road to Norco Animal Shelter.   When asked were I asked where I got him from they said it was Riverside's problem.   They were not able help me out and say I pickedup the dog 20 feet away in norco.  The dog jumped out of my truck at which point I was threatened with animal abandonment.  I was then forced to drive 25 minutes opposite of where I was going to drop him off.   It sucks to he punished for trying to do the right thing.</review>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I wouldn't count on getting your pet here. My girlfriend and I went looking for a dog and fell in love with an alaskan husky, his adoption date was on 12/15/18 so we went in every day to visit him but today, 12/11/18 we found that he wasnt there. Upon asking about why he wasnt there, apparently his adoption date was moved up. Mind you we were going in every day they were open and there was no mention of his date moving up. I even brought up the fact that his adoption date wasnt until this Saturday and the woman behind the desk apparently didnt know anything about it. The staff also rude every time we went, and the dog kennels were always dirty with poop.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Super intendant was not very polite he talked to me as though he wanted to argue. I was there to take care of a ticket or issue. I didn't want to argue at all. I just wanted to take care of my ticket. I felt badd for the animals there.  Very eerie place.wierd..< /Text>

sketcy people, I wanted a dog so i came back the next day thinking i can play with it before its  "released date" but someone (probably a friend of the people that work there) took it 3 days before the released date, the date was clear on the paper but the lady told me otherwise. Very Disapointed< /review>

My dad really liked that the waffle came in a little cup compared to the bag that they sometimes put the waffle in. This is the only location we know of that has the coffee drink. Super tasty especially with the salty cheese. They have covid screens with a microphone so you can still hear the server. No Indoor dining and they are attached to ranch 99.< /text>

<text>Super extremely rude staff!! Horrible service!!! It was around 7:30pm I went into the pickup counter to pickup my waffle which was already sitting in the corner. I am pretty sure the staff saw me when I went in because she looked at me. However,  she didn't greet me or ask me do I need help. She just walked away. Several minutes later, she came back and I tried to tell her the waffle in the corner should be mine. She looked at me again, didn't say anything,  walked away again. After all the other guests were served, I got my waffle. Cold waffle...<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>My love for Boba Tea with Salted Cheese on top is endless.  Today, I got a free drink from this very clean place that I love to go to weekly.  For every dollar that I spent here, I got 1 point on my reboot card.  After 10 points loaded on the card, I got a free drink  :)
The staffs are very friendly and always make my order of Tea correctly.  They even suggested really good combinations of ingredients that I never tried before and it turned out to be super tasty  :)
Other Happy Lemon locations can’t beat THIS ONE!
Just try this place once and you will have a big smile on your face  :)< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I've had boba tea from dỉfferent places/ brands, but this Happy Lemon place is a notch above. Their tea is tasty and flavorful. The shop is roburst at time we visited in early PM.
You know it's good when the queue spills outside in winter,/spring time.</Text>

<Text>It's like every other Happy Lemon. The most popular drinks are the salted cheese ones. A layer of it goes on top of your drink. They recommend you tilt the drink 45 degrees so you don't get pure salted cheese which is salty. If you plan to go frequently, get a reboot card. For every $4 you spend, you get a point, and 10 points is a free drink. There are locations all around the Bay.< /Text>< Response>

Great drinks, I recommend getting D5. The service here is amazing as well. If you are looking for a good place to hang out with friends or family, or even just getting a drink, this is the place.</text>

I have also asked my staff to check the milk tea and it tastes fine. We want to make it right by replacing a new drink for you in the event it occurred at our store.

Not a bad place to live. The mobile home park is a very quiet place. Not very kid-friendly even though there are many kids in this mobile home park. But all in all, it's a decent place, quiet neighbors, people mind to themselves. Decent management personnel a stickler for following the rules. But without rules there's anarchy, so I'll take the rules.</review>

<Text>I've lived here for years. With this new management the park is looking better and feels safer too. There are a lot of kids now that play outside, nice to see that. They just re did the roads and the streets look a lot better. some people still don't clean up their houses, but maybe management can get them to clean up so our mobile home values go up and not have messy outside of the homes. I think that most of the people that have given poor ratings is because they don't like rules and like keeping homes messy. I love living here.</Text>< Pics>

If I could put a big fat "Zero" for the rating I would, but unfortunately it only gives the option for one star. If you want to feel like your living in a Concentration Camp, Come on down!!! They have zero to none consideration towards the tenants and your treated like cattle. I have many of examples, but just take my word for it.    P.S. you've been 4 Warned!!! Enter at your own discretion!!!<//Text>

<UserId.>109875779824904384496</UserId.><text>Did a story on a couple here once.  They were being commended, praised and nominated for a award  for their generosity, kindness and humanitarian efforts in which the results have had a positive impact on society  and all walks of life.
Brian and Angie live here.  They make it 5 Stars.  They are two of the most generous, kind, respectful, courteous, polite, humanitarians and positive influences this millennium has to offer.  They spend most of their time helping people that are "less fortunate", homeless, etc.  Some things they have been  known to help or provide are,  food, clothes, transportation, home repair and maintenance , auto repair, legal advice and research, life coaching and advice and in home care and assistance. These along with many other selfless acts of kindness are accomplished at their own expenses with no outside help.  This is pretty amazing being that paying their own bills month to month can be a struggle.  Brian once said,  "People are just trying to live.  Everybody deserves a chance to live.  Some forgot or don't know how to live. A nudge in the right direction, a small act of kindness or talking and listening to a person can be all a person needs.  Just saying "hello" to a person can keep a person living for another day".

These people are amazing, truly amazing.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

They have the best food here! Hands down amazing Chinese food and I’m extremely picky. The owners are so friendly and kind. This is the best place I’ve been to in all of LA so far and they have a huge menu with a lot of vegan options which are also amazing. The orange chicken is my favorite, and even the vegan option tastes just like it. Beef fried rice is good too! This place is a must try.< /Review>

This food is incredible, such good service and such a sweet family. The Kelsey grammar orange chicken is the best I’ve ever had and the soft chicken noodles are unreal. Kung POW vegetables and egg rolls are delicious. Hands down best restaurant in all of Agoura.< /Review>

< review>
Well if they wanted to try this place for a while very interesting because it has regular selections and vegetarian vegan selections. So I was enthused!  Once I opened the door I actually had to wait a few minutes then call out before somebody new I was waiting to order. I will say there are 2 nice things about the place once you break the ice with the owner service was very good Is food was fairly simple no heavy sauces in what I ordered Is the food tasted fresh and very flavourful but simple ingredients 2 dishes and an appetiser. There was a decent amount of food That could feed 2 people. But every dish is around the 18 to $20 price range even the appetiser was expensive total bill was over $63 for 2 people for take out at a Chinese joint I think is overpriced. I also cannot say the meal was worth it or spectacular. It was good. The only exception I can come to or conclusion is it's in the calabas as area so the price point is higher. I dined in at a Latin restaurant instrument oaks a few weeks ago service was impeccable Drinks and so much food everything was tasty excellent an exceptional bill was just under $40 This was appetiser salad and a full meal plate. Hence the 3 stars.</review>

I love their shrimp so much, they were very fresh and big shrimps, taste really good but I don’t know what it’s called. I told her I like shrimp and spicy and she chose the right menu for me! If I can give them more than 5 stars, it could be 10 stars or even more. They totally deserve it :D<//Review>< Pics>

Tasty but pricey. Had a Szechwan dish and some soup, everything tastes very nice and the presentation is good! I agree with another comment that it’s a little “touristy” but overall the ambience is nice, the staff is courteous and the food is just above average.< /Review>

This place was a great find. The food was delicious. The staff was so helpful and friendly. They have a large menu. My waitresses inquired about what I liked. I informed her that I grew up with Asian neighbors and that I was used to homemade Asian food. She then said trust me I'll make you something good. She brought out the most delicious dish colossal shrimp with favors of turmeric and lemongrass with a side of white rice. They are also known for their vegan food.< /review>

<rate>4</rate><Text>High-end Chinese fusion in Agoura Hills? I'm in!

Mandarin Lotus is located right off the 101 freeway on Kanan Road. I never knew this place existed until my friend started raving about it a few weekends ago at the Chili Cook Off. Based on what she said, I knew I needed to go check it out. I was not disappointed.

To my surprise, this restaurant was established in 1988. Formerly known as Mandarin Express, this restaurant specializes in Michelin-inspired Eurasian cuisine, with unique molecular gastronomy techniques and recipes. Fusion recipes include tastes from many cuisines, including French, Spanish, and Thai, to name a few. Their ingredients are definitely high quality and fresh.

I've been here a couple times now, and both times were excellent. This is definitely elevated Chinese cuisine, and they have very interesting items on the menu. Their menu is actually huge, with countless options to choose from ranging from low price to very expensive high-end. I've only been for lunch, so I've only gone cheap with the broccoli beef lunch special, but I am curious about a number of their other items. I will say, the broccoli beef is very good here, and the rice is cooked to perfection.

If you've never been, I'd definitely say this is a worthwhile restaurant to visit if you're in the area. Service is very nice, but maybe not the quickest. They do cook all of their food fresh to order, so this isn't much of a complaint, just a heads up to those in a rush. Due to the proximity to my office, I'll likely be back soon. Go ahead and give it a try for yourself!< /Text>< pictures>

We'll see you again soon!"}< /Resp><review>At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this is the best Asian Vegetarian/Vegan food in Los Angeles and environs....and possibly in the known universe. The care that Dan takes with his amazingly original recipes is astonishing. And his wife Kim, who does everything else, is the loveliest person imaginable.  We have eaten here dozens of times, trying all the vegan things listed on the menu that I have never seen anywhere else and are always blown away.  Its a new standard of excellence for vegan food!< /review>< gmap_id>

This restaurant is my first choice restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most.

Not less important, the tariff is decent. I praise this spot with pleasure.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Dan and Kim are incredibly nice and friendly people. A week ago my husband and I were traveling through Calabasas from Las Vegas, NV and fortunately found Mandarin Lotus. The food was fresh, healthy, delicious.... actually very very delicious! We called in and placed an order for pick up, when we arrived Dan met us near the entrance and greeted us personally. They gave us complimentary mango rolls and a few mandarins! Prices are very fair for what you get, portions are big, food is really very delicious and made to order. They have a very big menu to choose from half of which are vegetarian and vegan options!
Next time we'll be in California this will be the first place to visit!

Thank you Dan and Kim for such an incredible experience!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
The menu here is extensive, and every dish is cooked to order fresh. As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciated the fact that the dishes were fully customizable since they are made to order- I knew I had nothing to worry about from an allergy standpoint.

We came tonight (Father's Day) as a large group with multiple, let's just say, difficult personalities. Although the service was a little slow, it was only one person working front of house, one working the back, so they absolutely were doing the best they could. Patience paid off, as the food was absolutely delicious. There was not a single dish that was off in any way shape or form. In fact, a couple of the dishes were made with vegetarian meat, and 2 beef conissuers accidentally ate one of the mock beef dishes and had no idea they did- it was that good.  In the future, with a large group, I may consider ordering to go, but as I mentioned, patience pays off dining in. Looking forward to returning in the future.< /Review>

BEST PLACE EVER!!!
The most delicious chinese food I’ve ever had! I’ve eaten at many Michelin restaurants over the years and Chef Dan is truly Michelin quality. He has raised the bar on what Chinese Fusion can be. The food is plated beautifully and that is just the beginning of your satisfying experience. Chef Dan has the gift of flavor. The combination of a wide array of ingredients and spices are inspired by different parts of the world. The explosion of diverse flavors play an ineffable symphony on your taste buds.
This is a most come place!
Chef Dan and Kim are the best!!! I am a customer for life!!!<//text>

<review>Mandarin Lotus serves the most amazing Chinese/fusion food. Everything is so delicious. Kim and Dan are not only a wonderful people and proprietors but also extremely creative. Chicken and beef options are outstanding according to our family meat eaters and I find the vegetarian options to be so unique and tasty (Wish I could be more specific, but I always order whatever they recommended and it is always spot on!).. this place is a gem!</review></record></dataset><record>

Food was ok at best. Clearly catering to the tourist. The spicy Won Ton was outstanding everything else was slightly better than mall food court or Panda Express Chinese food.  One saving grace might be the sizzling platters. Everyone else ordered them we didn't. Our mistake possibly.< /text>

Wow.  Over priced by about 80%.  Just in case you think I'm exaggerating.   Two bowls of soup, an appetizer of two small soft shell crabs, one dinner of pork ribs- d-boned and deep fried (very dry) with a lot of over cooked onions, too small pieces of red pepper and about 10 green beans.   We did get two egg rolls on the house and two small pieces of mango compliments of the house for $75.00.  I was also reprimanded for asking for a second refill of ice tea.  They only give one refill.  They have been there 30 years and for the life of me I  can't figure out how that happened???</Review>

This is THE BEST Chinese cuisine I've ever had. I don't live anywhere nearby but I always come here whenever I'm in Agoura. The salt and pepper calamari is absolutely fantastic. Hands down the best. The Kelsey Grammar chicken is always a good choice as well. Very friendly, family run business. I only wish I lived closer!<//Text>

By far the best Chinese food around and I would have no hesitations recommending this restaurant to anybody. Wonderful options and variety of foods. I have eaten at this place for over 10 years now and I still look forward to going there every time. So enjoy people!

Owners are wonderful too, very hospitable   .</text>

<review>Amazing food one of the best in the area. Top it off they offer an amazing Gluten Free menu for those of us that are gluten sensitivity/Celiac. I have yet to ever have a reaction. My favorite dish is the Kelsey Grammar Orange chicken. One of the best hidden gems in Agoura.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1507932888764, 'text': 'Thank you Cherie!

This 'hole-in-the-wall' actually has great food - high quality and well prepared. The owners are always looking to be of service. The food isn't cheap, but the product is more than worth it. Vegetarians have a full menu of "mock" meat dishes that cannot be beat. Celebrities often drop in.<//review>

the food was not what i am used to when eating Chinese. it wasn't horrible, but it was not good. i later discover that the dishes are "healthier versions" of typical Asian entrees. If that is your thing then this place is for you. PLENTY of vegetarian options. be sure to bring sanitizer and/or use restroom beforehand for there is no restroom for guests dining in. The cook and server were very kind, happy people.<//review>

We just ordered and my husband picked it up. The menu online was really inspired and sounded fun. The food was... ok. The honey chicken and the sesame chicken tasted exactly the same. We ordered the BBQ ribs and while they were good... there were 4 pieces in the order. The egg flower soup was flavorless except for too much pepper. Not great.< /review>

Do not understand the high ratings.  Ate there twice and it was horrible.  When I first saw the extensive menu I thought I was in heaven but what is on the menu and what you get served are very different.  I've only been there for lunch and they only had one guy (the owner) in the kitchen.< /review>

< review>
So, this is my seventh year living in Oak Park, and the first time that I've been to this amazing hole in the wall restaurant!    I'd always been vaguely aware of this nondescript restaurant - it's squeezed in a tiny space in a strip mall,  near the karate center, Nick Rail's music,  behind the IHOP, and way behind the Jack in the Box at the corner of Kanan and the 101 off-ramp.  I guess it was the "Express" in the name which made me think it was something like "Panda Express" - take out pseudo-Chinese junk food.  Or maybe it was the small restaurant space and buffet-like store counter which you can see through the front windows, also reminiscent of a fast food take out restaurant.  Panda Express it most definitely is not.  Mandarin Express is of all things a fancy gourmet restaurant!   Chinese-Mediterranean-Californian fusion food.   They take some basic Chinese food ingredients and cook it with a variety of vegetables and spices from around the world. You can eat an all-vegetarian meal here!  There's an entire page of mock duck/chicken/shrimp/pork dishes.   But their shrimp and other meat dishes are terrific too.  The food just bursts with multiple flavors in your mouth.  I really think they should re-name the place, or at least take out the "Express" part from the name.  It just doesn't do the place justice.  The owner-cooks are really friendly too.  A great place to take your best friends and family!< /review>

Wanted to like this place so much... did a massive takeaway order, service was friendly and fast. However rice was ice cold and the main chicken course was rubbery/inedible. Vegan meat option was ok but not great. Overall a disappointing experience</Review>

Apart from the fact, Mr owner ripped us off and charged us automatically on the bill a service charge, the place was ok. We had to ask for many, waited about half hour for the food and then charged $55 for two mains (rice included) and two glasses of water. We were stupid to tell him we are from UK so i guess he tried his luck on the service charge and he succeeded. Shame we did not know the US customs. Food nice but I have had better in that price range. We will surely come never again (what the owner knew) :)< /Review>

My son went here a lot when he lived in the area. So he chose it for his birthday dinner. When we got there it was obvious the owners knew him and had missed him. They asked about one of his friends that had passed away. In fact everyone that came in that night gave and received personal and warm greetings. It was like a family gathering.

What could inspire such happiness beyond cordial friendliness?

The food! It was close your eyes and luxuriate awesome!

While my son and I noticed changes to the orange chicken, it was still delicious. This is not a static restaurant. It's fusion. They learn and incorporate from a variety of food cultures. So the OC (which BTW we never found in China) they reimagined was great - no skimping on anything.

We tried the shrimp they recommended but declined to eat it shell and all (if you've been to China you know about exoskeleton delicacies - a taste we haven't acquired). But even though we took off the shells, the seasoning was too incredible not to nibble off from the usually discarded shell. And the seasoning on the included vegetables led to who gets the last one squabbles.

Mongo beef - great. Cashew chicken- great. Chicken fried rice - ok anywhere else but with how everything else was spiced to perfection it suffered by comparison but was still enjoyable.

There were many other artistic and culinary touches that enhanced the food experience. This is not a decor destination. This is about the food and people dedicated to their craft and growing with it. And genuinely loving it.

My wif and I loved it too. It's now on our list to return in a month for a date night.

I hope you'll try it and love it too.

Be seeing you!< /Text>

Over priced non tasty chinese food, they have 400 items on their menu, all taste the same, same sauces. They try to entice customers by offering free appetizers and some other free stuff, please dont fall for this trick of theirs, they will charge extra somewhere else and compensate for it. Here all dishes are 19 - 20 $. Please dont waste your money here.. i am ready to pay this amount if the taste was good<//Review>

OK, I'm not picky when I'm starving, but this food was awful! I'll never go there again. We had chicken and broccoli, pork fried rIce and "random" meat potstickers. The only thing good was the broccoli, no lie. Today is Chinese New Year so we thought we'd splurge and get Chinese food from a new place for us. I'm not sure how long it's been around, but this was the first and LAST time we'll go there. Seriously, I've  never written a bad review on Yelp, but this place motivated me to type!!<//review>

I got the lunch special and the food was way overpriced for the food you are getting (small portions, wonton didn't have any filling, egg roll wasn't fresh). On top of this, they charge extra for soup when it is pretty standard for lunch specials at Chinese places to include soup (mind you, the others are charging half the price)! One last chance for redemption: service...service was slow, even when there was only one other person in the restaurant.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Delicious food,  great staff.  I've been coming here for one year now and have explored much of the menu,  but there is still more to try (menu has well over three hundred + items). Fresh &  healthy, what more could you ask for?

Try the traditional dishes,  or be adventurous and check out Chang's Signature Creations on the menu.  Either way you can't go wrong.

The tobacco is actually crunchy! Either air got into the bag or it is old. No refunds, no exchanges means i will not visit again. I will purchase elsewhere. The 2 stars is for the owner, he was very nice.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I visited this place and I’m new to the area so I don’t know what good smoke shops that San Bernardino has to offer so I check this place out,so I go to buy a quartz nail for my rig which they had priced at $15 lol normally I’m use to paying $9.99 but he said $15 then $12 so I walked out and that was the best choice I made because I went to Highland Smoke Shop and paid $5 for what he was charging $15 for don’t be bamboozled into thinking he’s got deals I urge everyone to check out Highland Smoke Shop better deals and all around better service< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Portions are a good balance for the price. Meats are seasoned well. Wide variety of choices (beef, chicken, turkey, fish). Very limited parking, and food is take out only; no dining area. Easy to spot location.<//Review>

Big homemade burgers for a cheap price! Junior meal was only 6 bucks and was enough for an adult! My new go to spot. No sit down but always great for Togo! Recommend calling in your order!<//Review>

<text>Excellent fast food joint! We love cross country and only ever saw pictures of their glorious shakes and burgers. I myself am one for their perfect tots! I strongly suggest this place to anyone! I also suggest the habanero sauce, not just for your potato of choice, but also your burger. Can you say "game changer?"</text>< Pics>

Tried it one day and been hooked ever since!! But if you go be prepared to wait if you called in your order or not. The food is definitely worth the wait I will just say that. Just have your patience suit on LOL

Just went today and it gets better. every. Single. Time.< /Text>

<Review>Food was horrible!  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which I was told that they didn't have.  So I ordered the fish burger.  Price was around 9.00 at this point.  I asked for extra seasoning on the fries and she says, you want fries? I said all the pictures show fries, they are not included.  She says no, that is a combo.  I asked for the fries, now my order is in excess of 11.00 and no drink.  When I got my order, the fries were soggy and greasy.  The fish burger was 2 frozen fish pieces that you get from Mr Gortons. Don't waste your money on this ghetto trash.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

BOMB! Honestly tastes like meat and it's not so why not eat it without any guilt :) I love their fizzy strawberry lemonade  I usually get the single burger with kale salad it's all bomb ! With fries too I know I'm a fatty . Make sure if you like crispy get the fries extra crispy  The service there is usually on point I know it gets sometimes a little crazy and busy so you have to wait but the workers there are all nice and caring so I have to give it a plus for their effort and hard work ! So overall if your in koreatown for a vegan burger definitely recommend this place ! Pretty bomb<//Text>

Good food, but, takes FOREVER. Very slow service, however the quality of the food somewhat makes up for the 30-40 minute wait.< /Review>

Pretty good burger.Monster Burger. Hmmm if I were to rate this place, I would say it is better than In-N-Out for sure, and similar to Shake Shack, but maybe a little bit better. I really enjoyed my burger here while I was visiting - maybe it was because I was extremely hungry during that time, but I remember it tasting amazing. When I visit, I will go back again!</Text>

I love this place! Been down since they opened years ago. The food is the best at any hamburger stand in LA. Went this morning for a breakfast burrito but from the breakfast to the dinner the food is the best. If you not scared of a lil hood activity go here it's worth it.< /Review>

FIRST time trying them today! And I must say the food is everything people say it is and more. GREAT FOOD, REAL INGREDIENTS, GREAT PRICE. It may be in a not so safe area, but get in and get out. Order over the phone and ALWAYS give it an extra 15-20 MORE minutes before you go pick up your order. Again, get in get out. But the food is worth it!</Text>

Food is always good in dangerous areas! Just know the service is slow! It take an average 15-20 minutes for your food to be ready,so just bring patience the food is good!</review>

<review>This place has been here for awhile now. I only go when im on that part of town or when i want a giant American hamburger! I get the double king burger with cheese. Not only is it huge.....it tastes amazing as well! The neighborhood is questionable,so I'd order ahead of time cause it does take awhile to cook. You wont be disappointed at all!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Love their food. Generally everything is good. The breakfast is hit or miss. Didn't care for their French toast too much. The burgers are dynamite. I always get the chicken quesadilla with extra guac. It's a life changer! Not in the best area, parking is trash, call in pick up and be on your way. Still be prepared for a wait in line to pay and a small wait to pick up.</text>< gmapID>

Sorry if  you don't say what's really going on but this place get one (1) star, reason being their cook over salt everything from hamburger's too chill cheese fries, the pastrami is 99% of the time super salty because the don't change the water the cook just cook fresh pastrami meat (maybe) in the same water. And they say free 30min parking but it takes you 45min too get your food even if it's just a hot dog SMH. But the fried chicken and the fried fish is good... Button line just good see for yourself.< /Review>

Dirty hamburger place food greasy and bad and nasty on top you have to watch your back there's all kinds of drug dealing all around the parking park there will be shooting if things get out of control. I really don't know how all this is permitted I just think the hamburger place and liquor store and even the cops are all on this......I hope that all this gets under control specially for kids that go there with their parents!!!!</review>

I've had the double cheese burger, tacos. Pastrami and carne asada fries. All been good, but I mostly go here for the burgers, it's one of best I've had.. I don't feel like  It's the safest location.  so eat at your own risk and be low key. Once this guy got robbed here waiting for his food, aroung 1:00pm. Another time 1 block over near the pawn show a couple people got shot/ killed sitting in a car. This was in the daytime also.
I usually order ahead,  but you still got to wait a little while cause they don't put it together until you get there.</Review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>My food is always on point. When you go be prepared to wait atleast 20 min and that's when there's no one else waiting. Please be patient with the cashier there's always a crowd but it is WELLLLLLLLLLL worth the wait. Man in this case a little patience goes a loooooong way. Everything is really good I don't like the fries that much but the burger is so big juicy and filling I don't need fries any way unless it's the chilli cheese fries, now that's another story. So good. The food is fire. I never get to take pics because by the time I think about it I'm sitting there full like damn I should have taken a pic.. LoL< /Text></record>
