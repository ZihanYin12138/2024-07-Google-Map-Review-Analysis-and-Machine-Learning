I love this place and have been a regular for 2 years. It is a very professional, clean, and relaxing environment.  I am there every 2 weeks. The people there are very kind and do awesome work.  Also, they are in tune with the latest trends.</review>

<text>I’ve been getting my hair cut with Alan here for the last 3+ years and every time I get a consistently high quality cut. Very professional and easy to talk to. These days you can also get an outdoor haircut for Covid safety, which is what I did yesterday (first haircut since the pandemic started). I felt comforted knowing that Alan takes the situation seriously.

I also love getting manicures and pedicures here, and usually my family has a nice tradition of going all together for the day for haircuts and nails.< /text>< Pics>

Although I cannot say for its hair salon services, I strongly recommend those looking for a men's haircut to look elsewhere. I visited for a haircut a few weeks ago. The wait itself took over 40 minutes. It appears they prioritize regular salon services over haircuts. The barber clearly did not do haircuts regularly and could not follow the simple instructions I provided. There were even segments that the barber completely missed, which became a growing irritation weeks later. I would have to put their haircuts lower than your typical supercut.< /review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>The owner speaks with sugary affectionate terms and always makes room for drop-ins that she fits in because she has a lot of employees continuously working. Bustling, busy cuttings of all sorts. Haircuts, nail trimmings, waxing and waning. Alan, the hairdresser and colorist is building a nice reputation. It's best to call ahead to make an appointment, or grab a Starbucks coffee across the street while waiting.<//text>< Pics>

My favorite spot in the bay area to get a pedicure. Always high quality and friendly, simple service.  Very clean and accessible. Also quick eyebrow waxing that's pretty painless.< /Review>

<Text>Great little spot to stop in and get your nails done! I asked for just the basic pedicure and they finished in good time. No fluff, in and out and they did a good job. I docked 1 star because they prefer payment in cash and there wasnt a huge color selection. I will definitely be back!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808fbaf883a8a137:0xd236dafa9582fbe4< /Gmap_id><Rating>4<//Rating>< userid>

<review>Wonderful staff and lovely salon. Good color selection for both regular and shellac and the service has always been great. They are cash only which is fine but just something to keep in mind. The only downside is that they do charge $5 to remove shellac while some other places, as long as you're getting shellac, will not charge the $5. Still, I do highly recommend!<//review><username>Jessie Kuo Tu</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

<review>The owner did an all over balayage coloring to my dark hair. Instead of using bleach she used dye to lighten it as much as possible without damaging it. It turned out fantastic, looks beautiful and I've been getting great compliments about the color and how natural it looks.  This place is great- the salon is clean, comforting and all the girls were very kind.<//review><response>None< /response>< userid>

I had a manicure with polish, pedicure and opted for a 5 min  neck upper back hot stone massage. There was no wait time and they do a very excellent job for nails and pedicure with spa water gor feet.  fit budget. Skin glows after massage . Very relaxing and detail oriented with nails. Loved it.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>UPDATE: STILL AWESOME
I still LOVE Oh My! Salon.  My original review of 5-stars still stands! A sign of a good place is also CONSISTENCY.  My most recent cut this weekend was just as great, if not better, than the first one because Allen actually still remembered me and how my hair was cut last time!  That was 6 months ago!

Allan has been cutting hair in the area for over 30 years.  You can't survive in this area for that long if you're not good.  I happen to be chatting with a neighbor and mentioned that I found a hairstylist that I really like.  When she found out who it was, she was so excited to find it was Allan because she used to go to him and LOVED him at his previous salon but wasn't sure what new location he was at. That says a lot about a hairstylist when customers are loyal.

******************************************
MY PREVIOUS REVIEW:

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Oh My! and Allan, in particular, for haircuts!  I've lived all over the US, so I've had my hair cut from high-end salons in Manhattan, NY to suburban salons that have been around for decades in the West Coast so I've seen the whole spectrum.

FRIENDLY CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Julie who greeted me at the door was very warm and friendly.  Even though she was helping other customers, she acknowledged my entrance immediately.  Even Allan who was cutting a person's hair turned to smile at me.  It just shows their attentiveness and awareness of their customers.

CLEANLINESS:
Oh My is nice and clean...which is one of my top criteria when choosing a place.  Oh My keeps their floors swept/clean and the cutting stations are clean and uncluttered.

DETAILED-ORIENTED:
Allan listened to exactly what I was asking for. It was my first time at the salon, so he wanted to make sure he got to know my style and taste. I had asked to cut my hair 4 inches which was quite a bit for me, but he said he'd cut it 3-3.5 inches first to see if I liked the length and would cut it again if I wanted it shorter.  Even though it would mean more work for him, he wanted to make sure that I liked the length before he cut the 4 inches off the first time around because there would be no going back once it was cut. Of course, he was RIGHT! Once he cut it 3 inches, I realized I didn't want it any shorter. You can tell he's been cutting hair for a long time because he knew that I probably didn't want it as short as I thought.  What a save!

Allan was extremely detailed in his cutting...from checking the length in all directions to making corrections even after he dried my hair.

REASONABLE PRICING:
Again, as mentioned before, I've gotten trims in my life that were $125+ all the way to less than $20.  What I've learned is...more expensive DOES NOT mean better quality haircut. My shampooing, haircut, and blow dry came out to only $45 at Oh My! which is very reasonably priced considering the area and considering the quality service I received.

If your looking for a high quality haircut without having to pay for the "frills" that really don't matter (e.g., high-rent, fancy salon decor, etc.), then Oh My! is the place for you!  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to any of my friends.  I'll be going back again for sure!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fbaf883a8a137:0xd236dafa9582fbe4< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>True story - I was at the register w a fifth of Tito’s. The cashier said “Did you know the half gallon is the same price as the fifth? Let me go get one for you.”

This is the best place to buy alcohol in LA. Plus you can get weird stuff like this fireball candy cane. Thanks, BevMo!</text><resp>None<//resp><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWgIvts5-W2NmM0O6N5fvlzCDhWzMkg3siLCqK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><username>Meesh</username>< Date>

They have wine testing here which is continually fascinating on the grounds that they allow you to examine and impart your insight about the wine and the winery that has been addressed. I love this spot!<//Review>

< Review>
Avoid this specific store like the plague. I went to pick up an online order a while back. First of all, the employees ignore you until you actually ask them for help. Second, the guy employed there (I won't say "working" as none was being done), seemed upset that I had interrupted his conversation with a female employee to ask for assistance, and simply pointed to my bag of items I had purchased.

I have never encountered such rudeness at a Bevmo - for comparison, both the East Pasadena and especially the Pasadena locations are extremely pleasant and helpful.

Next time, I will be sure to go out of my way to find a different store, as I have no inclination to go near this one again.<//Review>

Bad policy about needing to order online when I was in your parking lot. Literally drove to 3rd street and spent $500 in corner liquor store. Change your policy, use logic and intelligence, it’s not that hard. Or go out of business, your choice.< /text>

Employees were nice with greetings, however, when I went to check out the cashier left a glass of wine unwrapped and not in a bag or anything. When I asked if he could put it in something to protect it, he acted annoyed and walked away. Sad customer service.<//Review>

OK prices, not great.  No bargains.

Couldn't find barleywines or any Russian Imperial stouts without coffee used for flavor.  Yeah, coffee-flavored stout is popular for the moment but sometimes a smoother, more pumpernickel-like, stout is desired.</Review>

<Text>This is the place you want to eat , drink , and have fun.     Top notch service, atmosphere, and over all quality on anything you order.   The staff is always personable and courteous.     Food is fast and delicious with perfect size portions.   Drinks or cold. Specialty drinks such as margaritas are not too strong like most places.      Taco Tuesday ($1.50 each ). Pork steak or chicken!    Karaoke is always a fun time.   Plenty of TVs to watch sports and they will change the tv to your game.   They have options of casual dinning or bar.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

¿no? No. No service, no one around. When we finally were seated to give our money away, the service slope continued. Hey, good news, we had a coupon.< /review>

Delicious food! Great and fast service! Got there right when it opened. Service was great and they paid attention to the table to get anything we need. Drinks were good! They don't actually have raspberry tea...< /Review>

Father's Day.  We came early to avoid the crowd.  We've been coming here for years. Food was bland and cold. Waiters were attentive but not busy enough. Tables were empty inside while there were people outside waiting,  why? The price was the most  I have ever paid  at  $80.00 for 3 people one was a 13  year old.  Won't be coming back here anytime soon.<//review>

Had lunch yesterday with 15 Red Hatters.  Gilbert gave us excellent, entertaining, impeccable service.  His helper, Albert, was also most attentive,  I am planning on returning soon with others,< /text>

Service was not great.  I frequent El Torito very often around California.  The servers rushed me and the bartender was not friendly at all.  I was asked to close out the tab in a rush, considering the lack of service and irritability I received as a customer.  I would not recommend El Torito over other other choices in the area.  Rude servers.  The only friendly person was the hostess.   For a $20.00 meal this really sucked.<//text>

<review>Eat at your own risk. I ate their Macho Combo and I haven't been this sick in my stomach in years. I was vomiting repeatedly for 24 hours and was in severe pain. I called them to complain and all they said is that they will file this with their corporate office and they'll take it from there. If you like, we can have them contact you. That's it! El Torito WAS my favorite restaurant. My food poisoning was so bad, I'll probably never eat at any El Torito again.</review>< pics>

I ordered the Chile Verde and it blew away my already high expectations. My wife got the street tacos. Chicken and carnitas and wished she had ordered all carnitas. Our two dishes were great. If I come again I'll probably get the same thing a dozen times in a row.< /review><user_name>Michael Scott< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went there with a friend randomly during a family vacation while driving in the neighborhood.  We decided to grab a bite and did not bother to check the reviews online.  The food are indeed not what you expect from a Mexican restaurant based on my past dealings with restaurants of this kind. Anyway, I believe in second chances. Hope the management will do something about the unfavorable responses from previous patrons.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc718f230fb069:0x7526f762d900045b</GmapID></record>

The two stars are for the server, that despite the food fiasco, kept her desire to serve us well. No more excuses here for the so called cocineros dishing out the food. Plates ordered for a party of four that arrived hungry at around 7 PM:
Carnitas, $17.49. Average at best. Dry and the parts that were not were fat. Beans covered in salt. Rice slightly better. 3 Stars
Two Item Combo, Chicken Tamale and Chicken Flauta, $13.99. Tamale simply put: distasteful (where is a street vendor when you need a decent tamale?), the Flautas dry, bland, no love of cooking here. Beans salted with a vengeance. Rice easier to eat. 2 Stars.
Macho Combo, $16.99. Consisting of a fire-roasted padilla Chili Relleno, the best of the quartet. A Chicken and sour cream Quesadilla, a sad affair. A Beef Barbacoa crispy taco, with more lettuce than possible. Cheaply made, not appreciated, left almost intact. Hand made Chicken Tamale, who is kidding who here? Worst effort and absolute lack of redeeming qualities. Beans salted to no end, rice just okey. 1.5 Stars.
Baja Combo, $17.99. A slap to my the taste buds. Two bacon wrapped shrimp (by looking at the photo one believes they are going to be large and plump) these shrimp are a joke on the customer. Mahi- Mahi fish taco. Dry, barely any of it, a really sad and expensive fiasco. Mazatlan Enchilada: run, don't walk, avoid at all cost. Miniature Bay Shrimp, no more than two or three, with a sad excuse for a sauce. Beans horribly salted, rice no skills. 2 Stars.  Tortillas warm, salsa past its prime, one of the worst.
Cocineros (cooks) with either, or: resentment to management-low wages, no incentive to do better, no skills whatsoever, could not care any less.
Total: $71.61, plus a decent gratuity for the poor server who has to serve such badly made food. Money for nothing resembling quality. 2 Stars.<//review>

Race do not go to this place do not accept the true Mexicans or the consular or Latinos who do not carry California ID is a company of gringos making gringos happy in a place that of Mexicans, hate race and security people of color that Mexicans do not want there, the truth is that it hurts in addition to being very expensive and the drinks are very low.

King Door Corporation located in Bakersfield, CA is an outstanding company that exceeded our expectations. From the moment that Chandler, their professional and polite technical representative arrived until the end of the garage door installation, everything was installed skillfully and efficient. The Technical Service Representative Chandler performed a detailed garage door inspection, then after installing the  new garage door motor and attachments, then performed and inspected its operational alignment, and including leveling the motor for longevity and premium performance. After verifying the new garage door motor/ rail installation the service tech. double checked and adjusted its operations. Then the tech. programmed the garage door wall control and the vehicle.

Thank you King Door for being an outstanding corporation, you saved me hours of having to buy/ install a new garage door mechanism that would have caused me hours to personally install. And thank you Chandler for your professionalism...

Sincerely,
Rick Allen< /text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I was called by our neighbor who noticed that our garage door was open. He and his son forced it closed (for the most part), and when I arrived home, I found that both bottom brackets were detached from the bottom panel, and the door had come off its rails and was stuck between the rail and the wall. definitely not a job for me to try to tackle.

King Door was able to schedule a technician (Jorge) for the next afternoon, after I returned from work. Jorge identified the problem right away, and within an hour, the door was repaired. He was very friendly and allowed me to watch him while he worked (so I could learn something about how garage doors work), and patiently explained what he was doing and why. Although our spring was not broken, he offered to replace it, and since it had broken about 6 or 7 years prior, I thought we should replace it "just in case." He replaced it with not one, but two springs, which he said were a newer variety, rated to last 20,000 cycles. I felt the price was reasonable, especially for accommodating after-hours repair. Overall, great work, and I would definitely recommend them to others with garage door issues!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ7xjrl5xtoPEVid7g6RMdGekt5R4pgB5NN_M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqRs7TDyiVqrfJQ4c6FAK6uEVGHSGOQesK3og=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVjzzVqTudLMRS8JD8O1nvSso3Tje71diw0gY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Ricardo and Alan replaced 2 old garage door openers with 2 new belt drive garage door openers. They also installed key pad, programmed both of our vehicles. They did this in a timely, professional and courteous manner. King Door uses high quality material and professional, courteous employees.< /Review>

Called the first company and after inspection presented a bid over $1000.00. WOW Shock.  Called King Door and Ronnie and Nick arrived QUICKLY and inspected the doors.  Conclusion - one door has the spring broken and the other door just needed a bracket adjusted.  Quoted the price which was less than 1/3 that of the first company! I made inquiry of items on the other's bid...they told me those items were in good shape and would not need replacing!

OK so first company was gouging me - KING DOOR IS AWESOME.

Need to add another star to the rating - this company and Ronnie and Nick in this instance, are far above the other company.  ******

A special "Thank you" Ronnie for your knowledge, kindness and honesty.  You represents the company very well!

<Review>Our Go-To guys! They installed the opener four years ago and everything was fantastic...until today. The door started opening and closing on its own, possessed by some technological demon. Clayton arrived within an hour and went to work diagnosing, repairing and testing as well as tuning up the whole mechanical systems of the door itself. Quieter than I ever remember. Big thanks here!!!!<//Review>< name>

<text>We are extremely happy with the courteous, professional, and quality work we received from King Door Co., Inc. The person who did the work, Jason, was excellent. We've been very unhappy with the poor customer service trend in many businesses over the last decade, but Jason and King Door Co. totally contrast that trend and provided us with a great experience. I was able to get same day service, and the service I received was experienced and the installation went very smoothly. He gave me sensible reasons for what he did and explained how to maintain good performance from the unit. He gave me good feedback on what we had purchased and the condition of our structure. He installed new springs, straps, hinges, wiring, the control unit, the motor and rail, and adjusted it all to fit our needs. He even cleaned up cob webs as he went along and cleaned up after he finished. He showed care with our opener and our garage structure. And, it all took under 2 hours.

We are very happy with the final product we have. It wasn't the cheapest price in town, but it was well worth the cost. We highly recommend  King Door Co. based on our experience. 5 stars.< /text>< pictures>

I have used King Door for years.  I needed a new opener and they were here within a day of the call and they came earlier than the appointment time. Ronnie was my tech and he was efficient, neat and explained the programing to me very thoroughly.  I am on their annual maintenance and it works well.  They are my garage door company!!< /Review>

I am really thankful for their honesty in evaluation and the efficiency of their service. Clayton did a fantastic job today in replacing our garage door opener and took the time to help program our vehicles for the garage door as well. He thought about the 'other' things that would make this experience with new equipment valuable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Friendly, reliable, punctual, and professional organization! They came highly recommended from a local business owner and now I’m recommending them to you. We had used “the other guys” who I’ll admit were significantly cheaper but way less professional and unreliable. As the adage goes: “you get what you pay for!”<//Text>

I am so very pleased with my experience with King Door. I originally called them for an estimate on a new roll-up door as my current flip-up door was seemingly old. When the tech, Ronny, arrived and began to measure, it was apparent this was not going to be a simple job or a cheap one; due to the odd configuration of my garage. He explained to me the reasons for the additional work, supplies and cost. This raised my quote far beyond what I was expecting. The tech offered a solution to my issue though. He told me the that springs on the door were inadequate for the size and weight of the door. He said that he can replace them and that it should resolve the issues I was experiencing. He not only replaced the springs with proper ones, he inspected all of the bolts (tightening as needed) and calibrated the opener. MY GARAGE DOOR WORKS PERFECT NOW!  Ronny, very well could have lied and told me that it’s in need of replacing and there was no fixing the issues, but he didn't. His honesty is what stood out the most. The pricing is sensible and the service was great! Therefore, I will continue to do business with King Door from now on and recommend them to others as well.< /Review>

Johnathan & Brian installed a brand new garage door at our rental today (7/12/2018, 93308). They did an absolutely fantastic job. It was really hot & humid – they never complained & continued to work steadily to get the job done.

They were cheerful, helpful, polite …and best of all – knew exactly what they were doing. VERY pleased with their work.<//Review>

<text>I called King Door on the afternoon of May 1st. I talked to Ronnie and told him that one of the springs on my door broke and I needed it fix as soon as possible because I park both my vehicles in my garage. He said he could get someone out there that afternoon. A little after 5pm  their technician Jorge showed up. I asked him how long the repair would take and he said less than 1/2 an hour. Jorge was very polite and professional. He got the repair done in the time he said and I was back to a door that would open and close. The price for the repair was very reasonable and the quick response was  awesome. Thanks King Door for the great job done.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I am so happy with my New WLED Lift Master door Opener! What a great investment! Perfect George, whom installed the equipment was a professional. Also, George was so helpful with educating me with this Elite gadget. I couldn’t be more pleased!!!

I called king door out because they installed my homes garage door and opener when I first bought my home. The garage door was opening and closing super fast and the chain was super sloppy needed to be adjusted. I made an appointment and told them I would be at work but my wife would be home, that I wanted my door to be adjusted so it opened and closed safely. My wife called me after they were done and told me they were trying to charge me 450$ for the repair. Come to find out king door decided to install a helper spring along with the adjustment. I was quoted 100-150$ for a door adjustment and service when i called to schedule the appointment, now my bills is more than double. So when I ask why the installer felt the need to install the helper spring he said well in reality these doors are to heavy for these homes and the way they are set up. Over time the springs will break and possibly collapse the entire door. That they needed the helper springs because the doors were so heavy. I pointed him to the sticker on my door saying his company installed the door so why would they knowingly install doors that are to heavy and not included the helper springs the first time. He advised me “ so they can get you to purchase the helper springs later on down the road” home depot sells the kit for 189$ I was charged 450$. I feel the installer took advantage of my pregnant wife and convinced her if she didn’t install the helper spring it could cost us more in the long run. I feel he manipulated her into agreeing we had to install it or it could hurt one of the kids by falling down. This company refused to come out and investigate, my glass on my door is still messed up. My door still opens  and closes incorrectly. I would suggest staying away.< /Review>
<Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1544213019167, 'text': 'Mr. Stokes, there is obviously a terrible mistake here. There is not one statement in your review that is a part of King Door’s Standard Operating Procedures.\nI pulled our records and my staff together on this. We came to your home on 6/1/2018 to replace the glass on your door. After our technician’s inspection of your door, he found that your springs were broken. Further operation of your door would have damaged your top panel. Because you had what is called a “torque-master” spring, in order to replace your spring that day, we needed to do what is called a “spring conversion,” using torsion springs, which is the industry standard. When on the job-site, your wife tried to contact you with this information but you were unavailable. Your wife was home and requested that we complete the job the same day, not to reschedule, and authorized the installation after final review of prices. I’m sure you can agree that neither you or your wife would have appreciated us refusing her request to perform our services, solely because she could not get into contact with you.\nWhen you mentioned that we manipulated your wife that this needed done in order to not hurt your children, this is absolutely not true. We are here to resolve our customers garage door issues. I need to assure you that we do not use scare tactics to increase gross invoices and our technicians do not work off of commission.\n(Our standard Service Call/Hourly labor is $148.00 + parts. The Wayne Dalton glass that you special ordered was $50.00).\nIn June, you called and our in-house technician explained the details of this work to you. We thought that this was resolved then and were not made aware of any additional problems. If there was an issue brought to our attention, we would have sent another technician out immediately under to resolve this problem.\nBut again, there is a large discrepancy here: Home Depot does not carry a kit for torsion springs.\nI take all of our reviews seriously and at most, want to ensure that all of your Garage Door needs are taken care of. Please call me, let’s resolve this.  – Roman, President. (661) 397-2744.'}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80ea40531b95e461:0xffad7b9b91013b9c<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>We called King Door on Monday desperately in need of a new garage door.  Ronnie came out that same afternoon to take measurements for a new door. Ronnie was very pleasant and informative.  Even though the door we needed had to be ordered, they were still able to install our new door on Thursday of the same week!  Jorge installed the door in the time he estimated and did a great job, even in this awful Bakersfield heat! We are very pleased with the people at King Door and the service we received.  Thank you!!</Text><Response>{'time': 1534778447191, 'text': 'Thank you, Deborah for this shining review.

I would like to share my recent experience with King Door.  I bought my door many, many years ago.  My own fault - broke the door and was stranded in my garage.  Afraid to try to open it alone to get my car out.  I called King Door and they sent someone out right away - looked at the situation, etc. and did not even charge me. Installed a quick lock to ensure it could not be opened from the outside, etc.   I was so relieved.
My new door was ordered - they gave me an option to use my existing beautiful stained glass windows to save cost - and it arrived in a few days.  The service tech, Clayton, could not have been more professional and hard working in the terrible heat of my garage a few days ago.
Even after working so hard and getting the job done - he helped me replace a light bulb that I could not reach.   Fabulous service, product and company.   : )  Rhonda Roshau</text>

<Text>Garage door seized and stopped, partially open...King Door repair rep. evaluated and quickly saw prob.  Repaired broken parts and checked track and motor bracing.  All done with friendly, informative disposition by repair rep.  Rep. sprayed lubricant on track,spring, and chain completing his work...now opens/closes smoothly and noiselessly.  Will certainly recommend King Door to family and friends.<//Text>< resp>

My wife and I have always used this company and they have always been prompt, honest and get the job done. Only use this company. We were mislead by a company called Fix It and Go which also goes by the name of King David. They told us that they were associated with King Door Company and when they ripped us off and we called King Door, they told us that they do not associate or contract with this other company and that this other company has been going around saying that they are associated with King Door. Just call King Door and make sure that you are dealing with them only and not any other company. King Door will be honest with you and charge you fairly and get the job done correctly.<//Review>

I called King Door Company "With The Pride of a Lion" after our door cables broke and came off the drum.  It has been years since I last had to use them.  However, their service is just as I remember.  I had an appointment I needed to get to and they accommodated me by arriving very quickly and completing the repairs in time for me to make my appointment.  The service tech was clean, professional and explained the needed repairs.  I was pleasantly surprised when the service tech quoted me a very reasonable price prior to beginning the job.  You won't be disappointed with this company.<//Review>

<Text>They've done work for me on two different houses, and they do good work.  There was a problem that occurred on the second order (delays and incorrect measurements), and the owner personally called me to apologize and clear things up.  I appreciated his follow-through, and look forward to continuing to work with the company in the future.<//Text>< UserId.>

Angelina, sales associate, provided excellent product knowledge and advice regarding products that would meet my requirements. Angelina highly recommended the insulated doors, I did get the insulated doors and very pleased. I hsd difficulty prtogramming my garage door opener and when I contacted them for assistance they arranged to have service technician Ronnie come to my home to help. Ronnie explained what was wrong and what he needed to do to correct the problem; nothing defective with the opener. In the future I'll know how to correct any issues. Everyone at King Door is awesome to work with and their lines of products are quality.< /Text>

Basically a Subway pizza quality or even lower for $17 before tax!! They displayed a $15 price tag but added $2 for toppings which was a hidden cost. Taste was it’s subway quality but at least you pay $5 or less at subway</review>

Excellent crust. Excellent sauce. Excellent Ingredients. Excellent owner. Excellent staff. Great casual atmosphere. I've been going to Spot since it originally opened near my high school. It's moved a few times but I keep making the trek because it's excellent traditional pizza with no frills.<//Text>

<text>Get the"X-Marks the spot" pizza. You won't regret the barbeque sauce. It's sweet and melds well with the other flavors. They make it fresh right there, $22 for an XL pizza. What more could you ask for?<//text>< Pictures>

Very good pizza. Usually takes 5 minutes or less. People are friendly.
Sometimes they put a little too much sauce. The slices could be a bit bigger.

I usually get 2 slices and a soda for 5 bucks.<//text>

Delivery service is a bit of a mess lately.  The time it arrives is not reliable (it was 20 and 30 min late last couple of times), we were charged the wrong amount and last delivery most of the pizzas were a mess when we opened the box.<//text>< Pics>

Spot will not blow your mind, unless that is, if you're mind blown by extremeley generic pizza. Great deal for two slices and a drink at $5. Staff is very friendly. Space is casual and often relatively quiet. Be warned, do not go to Spot during Los Altos High's off campus lunch and beware of birthday parties on weekends.</Text>

Pizza can never really be bad, but that doesn't mean it's good. Spot is like cafeteria pizza... tasty, inexpensive, but nothing special.<//Text>

<text>Literally the WORST pizza place on the peninsula. I placed a $50 order at 7:24 pm on a Saturday - they close at 9. At 8:52, I called and they did not pick up... But they close at 9? Unreliable, lying, cheating business. Unacceptable. Needless to say I never got my order and, obviously, never even got in touch with the restaurant.</text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Resp>

I'm pretty sure this is the only place in Downtown Los Altos that has affordable food. The lunch special (2 slices of pizza and a drink) is only $5 🔥</Review>

Love the food but the delivery men are very rude and demand tips from you. That's not professional especially if you are complaining then ask for a tip.< /text>

Me and my family are coming back so many times here at El Criollo Cuban Restaurant, for their awesome services. From food servings up to the food attendant and all staff are great, friendly and very nice. We found this place in internet, and we hurry up to visit and tried their food. We have no regrets of having our meal here, food can't describe how delicious all of them and perfectly cooked. Of course, we will definitely come back here and here again.<//review>

The best of the best Cuban food. Been going to El Criollo when they were located on Victory blvd and Fulton. Never really crowded when I have gone. Prices are great, service is fab, food is amazing.  Small parking lot in the back, also street parking. This place has been around for a long time. A must go to place if never been. You wont regret it</Review>

<review>This place is super nice and clean. The decor is pretty cool and somewhat urban.

Our waitress was immensely friendly which was great.

The food was also great. I tried the sandwich Cubano that comes with a side of either fries/salad/chicken soup. I tries the chicken soup and yummy yummy! The sandwich was also good.

Will def come back and try more food. Oh and it's happy hour all day long.< /review>< pics>

<Text>I love Cuban food and El Criollo does it right.  A giant milanesa steak with fried plantains, white rice w/black beans, and a side of yucca in garlic sauce is a combination that leaves me in a happy each time I have it. This place is absolutely worth trying, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed at all!</Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I googled this place and was pleased with the rating. I went in yesterday around 3 o clock and there was no diners in there. I wasn't greeted or acknowledged. For a moment i thought the place was closed. Turns out there was 3 employees present...the "server" that threw the menus at us, the chef she was gossiping with in the kitchen while we tried to make eye contact with her to take our order and the little lady with a hair net that came out of the restroom. Also location was
isolated with trash surrounding. Yucca tasted overcooked and processed, rice had a metallic pot taste. Plantains, black beans and mojitos were good. Will not be back.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Great Cuba food.  Chicken in red sauce is falling off the bone good.  Service is great and food is hot. If you're in the area stop in for lunch.</Text>

The food here is fantastic.  It was started by a mother and father and the recipes are homemade.  I loved the Mojo sauce on the avocado salad.  It is definitely worth trying.  It is my favorite Cuban restaurant.< /review>

I like the grilled jerk chicken as well as the fried wings. I frequent El Criollo Cuban Restaurant for lunch and the lunch special is a large portion. Can't go wrong here.</Review>

<Text>A great little Cuban spot off of Sepulveda. Park around back (accessible via the alley behind it.)

The food is amazing. All the appetizers are delicious. Pick any chicken entree and you'll be set. But my personal favorite is the Lomo Saltado. Can't get enough of it.

The staff is really nice as well.  Just be warned that service is a bit slow. It's just the way the place works. But it's well worth it.<//Text>< Time>

<Text>Idk how a place this expensive has survived this long in van nuys. The drinks are phenomenal! The food is simply okay. I really wanted to give this place a four, but the food just wasn't there for the price. I recommend this place for drinks with a friend though!< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Good food better than Versalles in Encino. A little to salty but that is usual in all Latin countries. Also, they have a red sangria made with wine and rum is good but it used to be better 5 years ago when I was here last before today. Service was okay it could have been better. The lady who served us was not to inspiring or welcomed us. There was a gentleman who used to work here who was top of the line service and will greet us and walk us to our table of preference.
You can order a turkey for thanksgiving or a pork leg for Christmas, absolutely delicious.  I will comeback to this cuban place because the food is.👍<//Review>

Overall: food lacked flavor.

After having a very attentive server I really wanted to like this place but it really fell flat.

My go to dish for Cuban good is Lechon Adada and potato balls. The potato balls were bland. The Lechon asada was so oily. It came with three small plantain slices. The pork wasn’t typically shredded. And the entire dish was covered in oil and overall lacked flavor.< /Text>

We've been going to El Criollo for over 20 years, back to the time when they were at a different location. We love their food! Still, one of the best places to get Cuban food in the L. A. area. My favorite: the Lomo Salteado. Of course, the Moros, yuca, ripe and green plantains and just about everything else in the menu are just delicious and worth a try! Yum!< /Text>

Esmeralda Bridal custom made two of my daughters' Quince gowns all to my vision per my daughter's unique Quince themes. I am from Massachusetts and I found them through google. I viewed their website and saw all their work and fell in LOVE! I trusted them in 2016 with my first daughter's dress and they did an AMAZING job.  I trusted them again this year in 2019 to do my youngest daughter's dress and the dress is breathtaking.  They do not hold back on the quality of their work!  You can tell right off the bat, the amount of work and detail they put into these dresses!  They are the BEST in my eyes when it comes to Quince dresses!  Take it from me that bypassed all the Quince stores on the East Coast, to trust someone on the West Coast to make my daughter's dresses. Thank you, Esmeralda Bridal for all your hard work and thank you for your professional and courteous customer service.< /Review>

I was on the area, so I decided to stop by and look at their quince dresses. Even though I did not make an appointment, they promptly tend to our needs. My daughter tried many dresses on, and she loved the experience.<//Review>

I came in today with my little sister, mom, and cousin to look at dresses for her quince. Very unwelcoming, a customer is a customer no matter how they look at the moment, you have to treat them the same. The man who helped us basically belittled us because we stated that we wanted a humble, little party and gave him a price range. Ugly attitudes from all the workers, their faces showed too. Don't recommend at all.</text>

Had my nieces quinceanera and was so grateful that Antonio the owner personally assisted me in everything from the dress finding the right designer for what she wanted cause he works with many high end designers to custom make a perfect unique dress for her, to the invitations and much more. Thanks emeraldas bridal for making this possible highly recommend anyone that has a big event to check them out!</Text>

The place is  very limited to wedding gowns. They only had about 10 wedding gowns available, the rest is online order and the sizes are scarse.Its a good place for a sweet fifteen. The customer service was not pleasant.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The truth is I do not recommend this place, according to they want to help you and they do not give you a little privacy, they do not even allow you to take a photo claiming that nobody does, I have visited many other boutiques, it is not the first and I will not settle With the first dress that my daughter tries on, what's more, they are much kinder in other places and they leave you the time you need and if you want to take a picture there is no problem, and this lady does not give you a chance to speak 😕😕😕 😕
A very unpleasant experience

La verdad no recomiendo este lugar,segun te quieren ayudar y no te dan ni un poquito de privacidad , no te permiten ni tomar una foto alegando que nadie lo hace , he visitado muchisimas otras  boutiques , no es la primera y no me voy a conformar con el primer vestido que se pruebe mi hija, es mas son mucho mas amables en los otros lugares y te dejan el tiempo que necesites y si quieres tomar foto no hay ningun problema, y esta señora no te da ni oportunidad de hablar 😕😕😕😕

Mr. Manager is not a very rude professional.

Bad Customer Service. The ower told me not to wasted his time Because I was looking for a Dress for my Daughter at head of time. I don't recommend this place, Go shop somewhere else.

Please give this place an award for servicing the community. The staff are cordial and timely. They offer an organized food giveaway for family/people in need. On the day I visited,  Claris Health was offering free pregnancy and STD screenings. There was a celebrity sighting for the promotion of the Mobile Clinic. Are you familiar with Sharif Atkins? Unfortunately, the parking is limited and the facility needs upgrades. Call them if you need any assistance.  @sorrellkids @savvyshammy #sorrellkids #savvyshammy</text>

Omg! There are no words that'll explain... how much each and every person who is either a worker, assistant, volunteer, minister, driver, or a person in need, etc., whatever the position they held at that time & purpose for crossing my life's path truly can express my gratitude of sincere thanks! Sincerely. I am thankful for their au real love...<//Text>

Everybody in this place is very respectful and kind, they help everyone with love and care, if you are in need don't hesitate.
Go and ask you are going to find food, a place to sleep, take a shower and they allow you to receipt your mail there.❤♥️< /review>

<Date>1576191830713< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>St. Margaret’s Center is a well-stocked oasis in the supremely gritty Siamese-twin deserts of LA’s “homelessness” and “poverty.” Friendliness, patience, and understanding permeate the very air of its buildings and pervades the hearts and attitudes of its volunteers and staff. People of all races, genders, and ages are treated as if they are “DEsirable” rather than  “UNdesireable.” The services they have to offer are many, so if you or someone you know is a current resident in at least one of the above-listed Siamese-twin deserts, contact St. Margaret’s Center. Help may be only a text, phone call, or visit away.< /Review>< pics>

I was helping out a friend and she says this is an awesome place to receive assistance when you have been ill or have fallen on hard times. It only serves the local residents so your zip code has to match the service area but the treatment that you receive is great. They help you with short-term issues like food, transportation and an address to receive mail if you're homeless.< /text>

I come for the food pantry which is so helpful since I’m currently on disability. Ramon from the food pantry is also a delight and so helpful. I’m so blessed I on a fluke found St.Margarets Center.
I’ve seen how they treat the less fortunate and it is with respect and empathy. And everyone’s customer service is EXCELLENT!!! Thankful for this place

Immigration office for questions to be answered, help for kids with homework  and assistance with paying rent if you recieved a 3 day notice of eviction. Those are only the services I know of but they have other services aswell.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Loved the environment. I got the truffle ramen. It smelled so good and delicious. The first few bites were amazing 👏 it was rich, full of flavor. Personally halfway through my bowl, the richness became too much for me. I couldn't finish the bowl - which means they give you a large portion.

Overall the ramen was great. The environment was amazing. The staff were super friendly 😊👍</Review>

My friend brought me here for lunch and the food was excellent. We shared the Broccolini appetizer which she liked but I loved. I ordered the classic Ramen bowl with an extra egg, which was also delicious. I liked the iced green tea as well. The service was very friendly and helpful, too. Will definitely visit again.< /Review>

I take my family to this great restaurant quite often! This is the best place to grab a bite.  I go there at least once a month. The food is just great, the staff members are courteous and the prices are good. I like meeting in this place for a tasty lunch.< /review>

<Review>Food is incredible! I have no complaints I recommend this place for Ramen.
Service? Was not good I had to ask several times for a fork and request more water and I saw  people in side the restaurant sipping on Starbucks and chatting 🙃
Restroom was extremely sticky and dirty and no toilet paper.
I will return just because food and cooks are amazing.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Been to a number of ramen shops. Been to this one a few time. Nothing particularly impressive. Service is not great. They forget things I ordered and do not check back with me in case I need anything. This was not observed just during rush. Seems a consistent theme. Noodles were not particular good. I do not like them soggy but they were quite hard and tasteless.</review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>I have been here a few times but every experience I had was different. This place lacks consistency and the last meal I had there was underwhelming. First time I got chicken it was good, second and third time the chicken was overcooked and really bland. The fourth time I decided against the chicken and got tofu instead. My ramen was warm but the mushrooms and mushrooms were pretty cold and cooled the broth down to a room temperature. It wasn't appetizing. Not interested in going for the ramen again but their small dishes are decent.< /Text>< Rating>

This particular location is disappointing. The broth is bland and pork is hard. Play it safe and go to the Sunset location. That location is the original.</Review>

<Review>People who live in LA know that Silverlake Ramen (originally born in Silverlake Los Angeles) is one of the top ramen restaurants in the entire city. Their new location in Koreatown is splendid, both on the decorations and food. I give them 5 stars although my only "complain" is about the service. They took a long time to serve us but since they opened like a couple of months ago I give them the benefit of the doubt. I am sure they are trying to work some things out. If you are craving ramen seriously, this place is amazing.

<Review>Their food is delicious! This was the first place I came to when we were able to dine in at restaurants again a few weeks back and they set the bar on what steps, cleaning, and hygiene practices a restaurant should be doing during these times. I went back again on Monday and they did NOT “loosen” up on their practices. They continue to impress me and I will continue to go there.

Unfortunately I cannot say the same for other places I’ve visited. If you are looking for a delicious place to eat that follows protocol, this is the place!<//Review>< Date>

< Review>
It's nice that Korea-town has been popping up with more ramen joints around town. Often times you don't know if the place you're going to go to for Ramen is good, but Silverlake Ramen is a trusted brand and a household name. With their classic choices and new additions like the Garlic Truffle Ramen (5/5) which was rich and deep in flavor, combining the feeling of pasta with the luxury of ramen. Service here is really nice too, the guys are awesome and they strike up a friendly conversation with you.

Lastly, even though I'm writing this review during covid season, I must say, the seating area here in the plaza is very nice. Private in a way, and it feels like a mini farmers market, the ambiance is very nice, and for that, it got bumped up from 4 stars to 5 stars.

Enjoy dining in!</Review>

The chicken paitan dx was soooo good. It was kind of a lot, so I shared with others, but the spicy soup was JUST right. I'll definitely come back to try the pork ramen.< /Review>

This place was absolutely phenomenal. Great prices. Super friendly service. The food was absolutely delicious, well seasoned, assembled pretty.The most tender pork belly I've ever had at a ramen place. So many side options, and this karaage is FKN fire. Pretty nondescript, but a bomb experience overall. And if you play Pokemon go there's three pokey stops just chilling on the patio, so nerd bonus.</Review>

We ventured out to see what all the buzz was about with this place. Soba Iichi has not yet been around for very long, located in the industrial part of West Oak-Town.<//Text>

Well, it is mcdonalds so it's pretty much what you'd expect. The staff are friendly and everything is fresh cooked, greasy and tasty just how I like it. Also open 24 hours!< /Review>

The night-shift drive-thru girl Cathrine is the best drive-thru person in the world. If I pull up to order and someone else asks me "can I take your order?" It's not a happy-meal and I say "No thanks."< /Review>

I got to that window and they told me to go to the next window, the pick up window, to place my order
. I got to the pick up window and they said I can't order at the pick up window, but would make an exception if I paid in cash.
The next time I went, months later, they didn't give me sauce for my Nuggets and they gave me an apple pie that should have been thrown out 2 hours prior according to the sticker on the pie. I know they are all about getting you in and out of the drive thru fast, but order accuracy I feel is most important.</Text>< Time>

I do really like this McDonald's for its convenience and "quality" service. Obviously it's fast food so "quality" is subjective; however, whenever we order food, it's hot and tasty. The orange 🍊 juice is also amazing!<//Text>

This McDonalds is one of the best have to work on keeping the homeless people away from the area where you order the food. You can't order because they are standing right near the menu window.<//text>

<Review>During the pandemic not many fast food places are accepting orders inside the dining areas.
You have to go to the drive through.
What if you live in the area and don't want to take the car?
You're out of luck, right?
No, this McDonald's is thinking out of the box.
Instead, they have installed a side window where you can order food if you decide to walk.
It makes it easier and you don't have to wait in the drive through.
5 plus stars for the person(s) who though this up.
Saves time and gas.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Mc donalds is really great. I have enjoyed coming here time and time again for the fantastic personalized service, appropriate atmosphere, and easy access from every part of the city making it very easy and convenient to find and enter. The business is kept clean and welcoming with good employees, clean facilities, appropriate lighting, clean windows and interior too.</text>

Now here is there a picture of a man that ate at Wendy's but I had a questionable moment at McDonald's it was fair service was okay the drinks could be better are there supposed to have Hi-C non-carbonated drinks and they didn't so I was a little peeved about that but other than that it's okay. And there wasn't anybody begging for spare change out on the outside so that was a plus< /text>

McDs is great for breakfast, coffee & fries but this location served a hash brown this morning that tasted bitter and rancid.  I suspect this location isn't changing out the fry oil as often as they should. Saves money but loses customers.</Text>

Great cheap place to get a snack and they have healthy choices. You can get salads and they have a $1 $2 $3 menu so there is something all can afford at McDonald's</text>

<Review>They literally gave us a piece of paper as a receipt with pen writing. Not even a legit receipt. Took 15min to verify a 100$ bill. Didn't know how to count change. By the time we actually got the food from the drive through it was barely hot.</Review>< Pictures>

I bought food for convenience, & obtained a horrible meal.
I ordered a quarter pounder meal and it was cold & the food was burnt.
I wanted to wash it down, so I tried to drink my soda & it was flat.
Double whammy!
It's safe to say that I will never be coming back to this particular establishment.

<Review>Ordered a quarter pounder NO cheese and small fry.  I asked twice, no cheese?  No cheese...two slices of cheese.  So basically I paid $9 dollars for a small fry.  If they weren't in there playing maybe they could get an order correct.  Took the survey asked for a call back...horrible place.< /Review>< Rating>

Clean well lit and open late to walk in diners .... Unfortunately it seems the tiny fruit and yogurt parfait that I adore has moved from the dollar menu to around 2 bux !!!   Ouch ... I hope it was only this store because a dollar is reasonable and I have lived with it ... But for it's tiny size .... two bux is far too expensive so if McD's has changed the price across all stores (is that even possible - I think not  ... Due to it's franchise nature) ...   Well suffice to say - if they have indeed managed to make my favorite McD snack outrageously overpriced ... I will be forced tor move on :)< /text>

I like to gamble, so I only come here when I want a 50% chance of getting what I ordered.

This one time, they forgot two patties in two separate burgers. Sometimes the sodas are warm and not carbonated. Other times they straight up just forget to put food in your bag.

Check your delicious, fatty, processed food or forever hold your peace.< /Text>

<review>I like this McDonald's. The service was fast and efficient, the restaurant was clean, and the professionalism was evident. Parking was a little tight. However, that's the trend now with McDonald's.<//review>< response>

Terrible service. The order taker was fine. The drive up speaker was not clear. The servers at the window had no idea what they were doing. They took forever. Gave me the wrong order. Didn't have my whole order ready. My shake was leaking out the top and got all over my shirt. The shake was good. But I will never go back there.< /Text>

It's 6am and the staff has a stick up the butt.. rude.. employee eating on the service line.. got up to get coffee and was looked at and ignored 4 times before I asked for a refill.. then was told hold on I'm getting an order.. not to mention that the restaurant is still dirty.. it's now 642am on Tuesday 1.17.17. The only good thing about this experience are 2 things the African American kid in drive thru he is a good employee keep him, coach him, and that I'm never coming back...</Review>

The girl taking the orders at the drive thru was tweaking so hard she messed up the order three times after having to repeat myself multiple times prior. Then the ladies at the window gave us two apple juices instead of two apple slices because, maybe the other girl shared her dope?? I mean seriously, I get it's fast food but this is ridiculous. I have never been so shocked in my life at what I just witnessed. I guess I'll wait the hour drive home to put mustard on my burger. Unbelievable.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>Similar food quality, customer service is comparable to other local McDonald's, close to Home Depot and the El Cerrito BART station; however this McDonald's is kind of small and has a horrible entry/exit layout for the parking lot and drive-thru.

For example, if you enter from Wall Avenue (northbound) San Pablo Avenue from El Cerrito, you are then forced to park (and there are few parking spaces) and you will have no access to the drive-thru (stupid!!!).  Unless you continue going down San Pablo Avenue past the McDonald's, U-turn at the Red Onion/Home Depot Entry, you will then have access to their drive-thru, where a few times I have entered from Wall Avenue and I instantly felt like a circle jerk at this McDonald's.</Text>< pictures>

This is by far the worst mcdonald's I have ever went to.. There are rats in the parking lot an on top of that it has the worst smell inside the bathroom.. Besides those two disgusting things they also have a bad habit of messing up on my orders. It seems to me like they are pocketing money because every time I make a bigger order more specifically somthing over 20 dollars I seem to be charged for everything that I ask for but not all of it ever shows up in the bag.. Usually I don't care an will just drive off but the attitude I received from every employee I encounter there pushed it over the edge for me I will definitely never return to this place again an definitely advice anyone else from going there to.< /text>

Well it’s McDonald’s...  My biggest grip is that the Drive-Thru is super slow...  but kind of like the TSA... what choice do I have when I’m craving some chicken nuggies?  You just gotta deal with the inefficiencies.  😐<//Text>

Drive thru had me wait 10 minutes after ordering  without charging, then came to charge, their card charger went out and they had me wait 5 more minutes to tell me they couldn't charge. I had no cash to pay, they wouldn't even offer a curtesy meal for the inconvenience. Overall lost 20 minutes from 1.5hr commute to work.<//Review>

It's McDonald's. The drive through is often slow but the staff at the window are friendly. I don't think the order takers can listen to one order while taking another customer's payment at the same time. In store staff is also friendly and undermanned.</text>

(Translated by Google) To buy a coffee I like 20 minutes later there was only one person in front of me charging and dispatched I think it's outrageous because it's supposed to be fast food ..... besides a queue of people waiting to buy and to give their food ...
