<Review>We bring all 3 of our cats to Haymont Vet Clinic and we have always had excellent treatment. The staff are attentive, knowledgeable, and they are all pet lovers themselves. I recommend them to anyone who wants a vet they can trust.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>My recent experience with Haymont Veterinary Clinic was very compassionate & professional ... they were there for me when I had no option but to euthanize my 18 year cat who physically failed suddenly on a Saturday. They were able to accommodate my needs right away (same day)so no elongated suffering was endured by myself or my pet! Thank you so much!!</Text>< Pictures>

They accept Care Credit which is a plus, and they have Saturday appointments which make my life much easier. Scheduling and rescheduling are fairly convenient and I know that my cats are in excellent hands. At times, the wait time once you get into the exam room can be a little lengthy, but I feel that’s how any doctors office is. They always seem to have parking for their customers/clients even on the busy Mission Blvd and though their building is pretty old and could use an upgrade, their veterinarian knows his stuff. The receptionists are adequate, but could be more professional. Overall the convenience outweighs everything else.<//review>

<review>The staff at Haymont Veterinary Clinic are awesome! Dr. Gill is a great vet! He is very knowledgeable and extremely personable. Veterinary care is expensive, Dr. Gill always gives a estimate, explains everything, and gives options.  My cat has been his patient for about 3 years and we have never had a bad experience here.<//review>< username>

They have been so flexible and responsive in spaying and neutering feral kitties.  Their practice is sensitive, caring and they make time for questions and concerns.  He was very supportive when one of the cats had to be euthanized.  I really like this practice.< /Review>

We've utilized Haymont Vet Clinic for 3 1/2 years.  Nutmeg and Pickles (dogs) love to visit Dr. Gill and staff. They often want to go in just to say "hi" when we're passing by on a walk. This is a testament to how well they are treated by the team when they go in for check ups, shots, or the rare ad hoc need. The team at Haymont Vet Clinic knows our dogs and they know us. We feel we have true partners in keeping our dogs happy and healthy.</Review>

<Review>The doctor and staff are great. Maggie first came in because she was having an eye issue. He explained all the possible diagnoses and explained the tests and treatments. He was very thorough with follow ups and made me feel confident that Maggie was going to heal, and of course, she did! One night I even called because she got a bee sting and it was after hours and he picked up! I believe his prices are fair after having gone to a few vets in the area.< /Review></record>

<Review>Dr. Gill and the entire staff at Haymont  Veterinary Clinic are caring, wonderful people.  I have 3 pets.  I used to have 4, but recently had to put down my 13 and 1/2-year-old boxer.  She had bone cancer and there was no way she could recover from that.  Dr. Gill was so kind and caring when we put her down.  You know a vet really cares about your animals as if they were his own when this time comes in a pet's life and the vet is so sensitive to both the pet and the grief that pet owners feel at this time.  Dr. Gill has taken great care of my pets both when healthy and when sick.  I highly recommend Dr. Gill and Haymont Veterinary Clinic.</Review><UserId.>102041924303319465173<//UserId.></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Haymont Veterinary Clinic is an awesome place to take your pet. I adopted my kitty Gina last year and I took her to Haymont to get a check-up. I was glad to see that the cat and dogs sections was totally separate so I didn't have a scary Gina on my hands (if there were barking dogs). The receptionist was very helpful and it was nice to get a few freebies in the reception area. The dr was also very helpful and he answered all of my new kitty owner questions. I will definitely go back again and recommend my family and friends to Haymont Veterinary Clinic. 🐱🐺🐈</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>After my chihuahua/doxie named Lucky became ill with a hacking cough I decided to take to a vet for a second opinion. This vet diagnosed the problem immediately. The vet told me that he has stage 6 heart murmurs but did not order a battery of tests and high priced procedures in an attempt to nickel and dime us. The medicines he is giving him are helping even though the doctor was honest about my dog's lifespan which I was grateful for as it gave me time to process and prepare for the inevitable.

I am bringing my other pets here I have full confidence this clinic does what is best for the pets and their owners.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Time>1560994962490</Time><text>I picked this vet due to ease of location.

Parking is kinda hard as there really isn’t anywhere to park. But that is not a reason to lose a star. They are losing stars for several reasons.

1. The price of services changed everytime I went for the same services.
2. They would tack on service fee charges that were not there before.
3. They had a great vet assistant who was great with my dog and then they replaced her with someone who was always upset with my dog for sniffing her.
4. They really shove meds down your throat. Even when I made comments about being uncomfortable putting them on meds. They still shoved it down my throat.
5. They always forget to honor discounts.
6. They charge crazy amounts for stuff you can literally buy off google or a dog store!
7. Most the time the Vet has no idea what’s wrong an just give just us some sort of meds. (The only reason I kept going back is because there was a change in doctors an I was hoping for the better).< /text><username>J R<//username><pictures>None</pictures><gmapID>0x808f93f68cfb873f:0x560c177977550c4e</gmapID><UserId.>109399244220563747645< /UserId.>< Response>

After her hospital stay, I chose Haymont Veterinary Clinic due to the wonderful reviews on Yelp.  It was a very stressful time for Coco and I.  Dr. Gill and staff made us feel very comfortable.  During consultation, as to how to proceed, Dr. Gill proved to me that he was very knowledgeable and really cared about his patients and their "parents".  I have since that time, also brought my other kitty, Buttons, there for routine services.  Further, I have availed myself of the kennel on two occasions, for both kitties.  All of my visits have been five star experiences.  I highly recommend them and thank God for them!< /Review>< userid>

< Review>
I took my twin cats to this clinic after I adopted them from off the streets. They had horrible scabbie mange, fleas, and worms. These poor babies were taken care of and they worked with me on what I needed to do first, second, etc because I couldn't afford everything all at once. They are great people and I highly recommend this place!</Review>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>Has definitely gotten worst since the loss of Dr Chenge. Level of care and compassion has diminished. Feel rushed at appointments. My senior dog passed away and I didn't get any compassion from Dr Gil. Been with this facility since 2010 and after the business was sold to Dr Gil, never received the same level of true care and compassion.</Text>< pictures>

Absolutely wonderful. The doctors were helpful and worked with us during a very difficult situation with our Dog hercules and cat Leo. They were also responsible about their recommendations to us keeping in mind our budget and we never felt pressured to accept care we couldn't afford.</review>

<Review>We met Dr. Gill and his staff when my daughter was trapping a colony of feral cats.  Dr. Gill and his staff are most helpful with TNR of these feral cats.  The last cat that was trapped turned out to be a stray and we adopted him.  We don't know how long he had been living outside but he had a myriad of health problems.  Through all our visits Dr. Gill would take his time to explain, be professional, supportive, patient and caring.  His staff is also friendly and supportive.  With all their help, our Senor Gato has found his forever home and is now living a healthy life of riley.  I highly recommend Haymont Veterinary Clinic.</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>I like this clinic so far. I especially like that they have separate entrances for cats and dogs! Not that it effects me since I don't have a cat nor does my dog goes crazy after them, but it's a nice touch!

My dog has been in only a few times but the front remembers her each time and are very loving. The dr himself seems knowledgeable, and didn't push anything too much. Her cleaning and extraction went well so no complaints here. Pricing was fair. The parking is odd but I deal with it lol. 4 stars because I usually have to wait a bit past my appointment time before I get called back or see the dr. Perhaps those were exceptions but it was pretty consistent.<//text>< pics>

The staff just left us in one of the rooms and never checked back on us or give update as to when he will be in.

The doctor did a free exam which consisted of looking at my cat on the table then looking at her teeth not paying any attention of the reason I brought her in there which was limping all he was concerned about was taking X-rays and blood work and trying to figure out things that I didn't bring her in for had to ask him specifically do you think you could check her paws ... that's what I brought her in for he did reluctantly... not impressed and not going back< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>This market is ran by people who are rude and will not accept valid CA Identification. They will use any excuse to deny you and will become very argumentative. We've been regular customers and they have accepted the ID every single time until today. Even knowing us personally. I would rate it a negative 5 if that option were available. They don't even know CA laws. They're also overpriced compared to other convenience stores. We will shop at Dukes where they treat customers fairly and in a friendly manner!!< /review>< Pics>

Good prices, nice selection, but I have been short changed there twice now. Both times it was the same guy. Fast talking, making jokes, keeping me chatting. Once is an accident,  but twice?  Could be accidental, but i recommend counting your change before you leave the store.<//text>

< Review>
I walked in this studio , without an appointment (we know how that sometimes annoys artists), with my 64 year old mother (only has one other tattoo she just got her first one a few months ago so still new to the game), my 50 something Auntie (never had one before but very particular!). And my 80 year old grandma sat and watched (she didn’t get anything of close) I was worried how we’d be receipted  since neither of them had a final idea and wanted some direction from the artist! Asked a million and one questions, and just overall was a lot for anyone!
When I tell you Dan handles my family with white gloves, he did! I think most people would’ve been turned off by their questions, annoyed they didn’t know what they wanted, no appointment etc!
Dan took me and my Auntie and did some amazing work! I got some Celtic letter and she got a Celtic symbol!! My mom got some amazing script lettering by Ric!! All of us left extremely happy with out forever Art! I wasn’t sure if I could find this type of quality in “lil ole Tracy” but I did!! Very very happy highly recommend!  Thanks guys for taking care of us all and being so patient and kind to my family visiting from out of town! We have a forever memory of our group tattoos!!< /Review>

nephtali_bruguears_jr (Lefty) at 12 Monkeys is an excellent artist to work with. Lefty performed a beautiful piece on my wife's family members arm. After seeing how great it looked we contacted Lefty to see if he could help with my wife's new tattoo. Talked to Lefty to see if he would be willing to take a look and see if he would be interested in touching it. Lefty was very nice and showed us what he could do.  My wife sat down and he did his magic. My wife went from kinda liking her new tattoo to loving it. Lefty did a great job fixing it. My wife suggested for him to look at my tattoo that I always thought was too big to cover. Lefty heard us talking and said let me take a look. After Lefty showed me pics of what he could do with cover ups I was down. Just had to come up with an idea. Bounced a idea off Lefty and he had me go read about the meanings of the tattoo to get an idea of positioning.

I came up with my idea and Lefty was into it. Made my first appointment and Lefty was on time, very professional, easy going and good company to spend your time with. Lefty's station and entire shop is very clean and professional. Lefty is a true magician. Lefty blew away all my expectations and made my idea way better than I imagined it. The entire process was 4 sessions and a total of 10 hours due to him having to blast the old tattoo with white multiple times. Lefty was on time and ready each time and was a true professional!

I know my wife and I will be seeing Lefty again. Lefty is a amazing artist that you can fully trust to make your art piece the best it can be.

Thanks Lefty!!< /review>

It only took him an hour to do from the time he laid the stencil. I get a lot of compliments on it. I refuse to have any other artist touch my skin. I now live in NM but will be returning for more. Thank you Jon. I so love you.</Text>< Pictures>

Probably the best tattoo shop in town. They're so professional, and hygienic. They work with your tattoo idea and adjust so it has the artists personal touch. The cost isn't too much either. If you want a solid tattoo, with fair pay, this is my go to place. My friend got his second tattoo done and I've had my first one done here. Definitely is worth it!< /review>

I had an old piece I'd been unhappy with for years after having it touched up (now it looked cartoony with the heavy colors) that I wanted covered up but had been told by several artists that my options were limited and didn't get much input. Jon heard my ideas and gave me other creative options that I didn't think were possible. Together we came up with a beautiful piece that I love again. The lines are clean, the colors are deep and dimensional.<//text>

I didn't get a tattoo, I just went it to have some questions answered. Super friendly and helpful staff! They were nice to me even tho I wasn't a customer that day! My impression when I walked in was great! It was clean, it smelled good and it looked very modern. If I ever get a tattoo I would consult them first!<//Text>

I have had nothing but great service here. Shawn Edwards has done 2 tattoos of mine and they are amazing. I am hoping to get another tattoo done by him. They are pretty fair priced for the quality of the tattoo.< /Text>

Krystal is the bomb, no style limitations. Wasn't sure I'd be able to find a quality artist out this far from the bay area but I did, and now I don't have to drive all the way to San Francisco.</text>

I did not have a pleasant time looking to get my first tattoo with this place. When I first came in a lady by the name of Jessica didn't really show interest in helping me with my first tattoo and gave me a "end of the day, just another customer off an assembly line, impersonal" feel. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, and waited for an emailed design of my tat. Once it got close to my appointment time I got worried and asked her if my design was ready yet. She sent 2 pics of a crappy design of what I wanted with no message of apology. It was already to close to my appointment time to redesign, and i just didn't feel like she really cared. Not only did I decide not to go with this shop, but she got $20 out of me (For a down payment, for first time customers, it case they don't show for appointments). What about tattoo artists who are the same way?! I should get my money back. No dis to the other tattoo artists, but this was my experience with this one.</Text>

They may be a little pricey, but it's worth it.  Jon saved a really bad start from another artist in town.  He took some really blatant mistakes and camouflaged it so that no one notices.  Of course I can point it out to people and then they see it, but if I don't point it out, it's invisible.  Really great work, I'll definitely stick with Jon for all my future work.< /text>< Name>

<Review>Came here for brunch with my boyfriend.  It's a pretty cool place.  Very open.  We decided sit at the bar. From the start we were attended by Matt. He was awesome!  He provided great suggestions and guidance on our order and drinks. He was super attentive without being annoying.

So for the meal we got the fried chicken sandwich, marbled egg and French toast. The egg dish was very yummy... light with creamy avocado chucks, tomato and nice greenery. The chicken sandwich was good. The batter had nice flavor, but I will say a sauce or aioli in the sandwich would have topped it off wonderfully.  Or if  there sauce then more could have been used.  The French toast was awesome!  Thick slices of bread, fresh whipped cream that was not overly sweet and candied pecan.  Soooooo good! I loved it.  That's exactly how I like bread... on the dense side.  I'm only upset I had to share it with my bf. Lol.

I'm not much of a drinker but after speaking with our server/ bartender Matt, I got the Saigon. A sweet coffee drink.  I loved it.  Paired perfectly with the French toast.

I would totally recommend this place!</Review><time>1539305226587<//time>< resp>

Great spot for happy hour. The outdoor patio and ambiance is great for middays and evenings. The food is quite tasty and the service is pleasant, but I would stay away from the housemade sodas.< /Text>

Chef Alice is amazing, among all the food on the menus, we love striped bass, mushroom it avocado toast, chickpea boullabaise, fried cauliflower, grain bowl, and hippie burger. Their pastry is one of the best! This is the place we bring our friends and family anytime from breakfast, lunch, to dinner.

<Review>Great atmosphere and super friendly service! Food looks amazing, as you can see from the picture of the burger I posted. But... My burger was just....blah and boring. As another reviewer stated, the bun was good.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Paid $12 for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich yeah I'll never do that again! I'll still give you 5 Stars though because it was pretty freaking good!  Plus I really like your seating arrangement and your coffee bar.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><user>115115132887167735324<//user><Text>I would give 0 stars if possible.
1. It's really pricey.
2. The salad I ordered only consisted of a bunch of beets. The description mentioned some pistachios and blackberries. Pistachios nowhere to be found and apparently blackberries are expensive because they cut 2 in half to make it appear like more (I was not fooled)
3. My boyfriend's meal came with a big pile of fries, which were undercooked, and a itty bitty cup of ketchup.
4. A shot glass of water.
Overall found myself really frustrated with the experience. I don't mind paying a bit for a good, well portioned plate of food, but the price in this case was salt on a wound.< /Text><Time>1500669930824</Time></record></dataset><record>

A fast casual restaurant, more on the chic side of casual.  One of several good restaurant options at The Point in El Segundo.  Excellent coffee and brunch options on the menu.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Great food, the menu is seasonal, and the chef is going to the local farmers market to get the food, so it's fresh. The drink "into the woods" comes with burnt rosemary and sage on the side which add a whole nother dimension to the drink. The lamb ribs were also awesome.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Disappointing considering the other location. Minor flaws throughout, from flat tasting hash to undercooked fries to oddly hands off service. And why did they keep pouring half glasses of water? Prices are optimistic considering the quality. Overall, a miss.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good service and a very nice place.
There is to sit outside in the sun, or inside.
Despite having a very small menu, the food is very good and the salads are huge.
Worth it!

(Original)
Muy buena atención y lugar muy lindo.
Hay para sentarse afuera al sol, o adentro.
A pesar de tener una carta muy chica, la comida es muy buena y las ensaladas son enormes.
Vale la pena!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1589744687571</date><Rating>4</Rating><review>Decided to give this Thai restaurant a try, when I get there, the outside doesn't look much, more like a Thai fast food cafe. I ordered Pad See Ew w/ chicken, Tom Yum Fish, Crab fried rice and a Thai ice tea. Among all, the best was the Crab fried rice, they used lots of real crab meat, and it tasted amazing. The Pad See Ew was slightly too sweet and the Yom Yum Fish was slightly too salty and not spicy at all, although I did mention I wanted extra spicy. Overall, they do serve decent Thai cuisine.<//review>< Pics>

Four stars for convenience, and three and a half for the food. But be sure to understand the heat. Medium spice was WAY hot so I would suggest asking for mild And spicing it up if needed. My mouth was burning which affected the flavor.< /Review>

It ranges from a good amount of food for the price, to not much at all.   Today I asked for Gra-Pow with ground chicken.  The chicken was barely ground at all, the dish is almost all green beans, and no bell pepper to be seen.  Hardly any basil, and not nearly as good as it had been before.   Also.. mixed-veggies isn't worth the price.. it's mostly carrots.  I'll hesitate going back a 5th time.  I wish they would be more consistent.. Service is very nice though.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtiuolSPVYwxJiJIvhyfM-eSEMfvkRwbtADequ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Hands down best Thai place around. Little hole in the wall with amaaazing food. The flavor is amazing in every dish we've tried,  and they can make it whatever spice level you want.

Definitely recommend the spicy salmon curry and eggrolls!!!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have to say that after all the years I've ordered take out and delivery since their opening, they have become more and more stingy over the portion sizes of their food as well as increase in their prices.

I ordered the Chicken Salad and Beef salad which usually come in a large white container full of greens but this time around they literally prepared the salads with only one cup of vegetables and 2oz of meat. That's pretty pathetic for the $19 I paid for both salads. I've never been more disappointed.. I noticed the difference in the preparation of their food (chicken being dry, food being overcooked, etc) but this.. this is pretty bad. The size of the salads alone should've been worth $5 at most. This will be my last time ordering from them. One customer down.</review>

< Review>
Run by Native Thais, Sri Siam has a plethora of Thai delicacies to enjoy. The restaurant is quaint, meant for takeout and delivery-food. Their Western take on the classic dish, Pad C Ew is perhaps a little too sweet for the palette of Native Thais.</Review>

Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. The soup had a strange flavor that was not pleasing I ended up throwing it away and the egg rolls were really greasy.</Review>

Never. Again. Their curry is now the SAME price for literally a HALF portion of what is was. I have had countless problems ordering here and this was the last of many final straws</review>

I celebrated my birthday earlier this evening in this gorgeous place. happy to tell that we had a enjoyable evening and the restaurant was indeed the reason for that strong celebration. The waiters  contributed in a graceful way, the cuisine was appetizing and my guests were very  happy. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. thanks very much.<//Review>

<Text>I found this place over 15 years ago, and by my estimate I've eaten more than 600 meals here because I try to get there once a week.  They have the best carnitas in the Bay Area that I've found, juicy, flavorful with a delicious piquancy.  With a change in ownership in 2017 I was scared, but the new owners have done the original founders proud.  The food is still magnificent, and several modernizations have spruced up the place.  It is still not a fancy establishment, so if you're looking for fancy this is not the place.  If you are looking for yummy Mexican food at a good price with friendly and attentive staff, this IS the place.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Solid food but it's nothing amazing. They take a while to clean the tables and restaurant so sometimes that's a bit annoying. There has been  a few times I've gone in and there was a lot of. Flies. Honestly the people are super friendly and the service is good but they slack on the little things and it adds up<//Review>

<text>Good salsa. Not a huge fan of their burritos (they're not wrapped tightly enough), but I can't complain too much. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it's a good place.

I've lived in the area for over 30yrs and this is the first time in, needles to say where have I been. Excellent service as well as food, I have to say just as good as mine at home. I recommend eating in or take out. Thanks Taqueria Vallarta<//Text>

I have been getting foods to go from this taqueria for over 10 years now and it has always been reliable great food (although I always get a couple of same items so not sure how other things taste.) Their salsa has more onions and saltier than I'd prefer but great taste nevertheless. Excellent taco salad, burrito with Spanish rice, etc. Very friendly service too, love this place!<//review>

One of the best spots for a good quick burrito, bathroom not always the cleanest, and it is disappointing that it is located right by the entrance.  Best tripas tacos around, if you are into that sort of thing.  authentic, (as far as sic me, the gringo can tell) Horchata. Friendly welcoming staffers.  Clean and sometimes loud and usually crowded dining area.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>It's a community clinic with a slide pay scale.  The staff are a very professional group of young ladies, the Nurse practitioner are very young.  I found the nurse practitioner I happen to see was very reluctant to to offer any help to me at the time of my visit.  I have not had any follow up from the clinic to see if I needed any additional care. Very disappointed in the knowledge the nurse practitioner demonstrated in regards to my condition.  I feel there should have been more concern as to my wellbeing and to helping me relieve the pain I have been having.  I was charged $55 twice for absolutely no benefit to myself.  My condition has continued to worsened and if I hadn't followed up on my referral, it would have never been made.  I had to make several trips back to the clinic to see what the reason my referral hadn't been made to the other Doctor.  I guess this is way things are when you lose your job and don't have insurance.  This clinic is not what I had become a custom to in the past.  Our health care system is broken and clinic's like this one clearly exhibit that fact.<//text><Name>Guy Robinson< /Name><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

Decent medical clinic, a bit run down and parking is small. There is more parking in the back if you drive around.< /review>

<Text>This mall when I grew up has always been mediocre. I can hardly call it a mall to be honest, but over the years, better places open up and I can see this place actually be something worth checking out. No real shopping can be done here, but with new food places opening up (eg crab hut and manna bbq), I can see more people coming to this place that is labeled a mall.< /Text>< pics>

Best place in Mira Mesa! It has many stores, banks, eating place, etc.
Grocery shopping: Target, Smart and Final, Marshall, etc.
Restaurant: Indian, Chinese, Subway, Cotixan, etc.
Banks: Citi Bank, Chase Bank, etc.
Others: Salon, Good will.< /Review>

I'd hesitate to call this place a "mall," but the Target is convenient, and the boba shop is pretty good.< /review>

Excellent customer service. They were able to get the nail out of my tire in a very short amount of time as I was on my way to LA from PHX. I am so grateful because they absolutely saved me from having to call AAA. I give this place my highest recommendation. All the employees I witnessed there were working extremely hard and had a very high sense of urgency. Thank you America's Tire!</Review>

<Review>While traveling from Oregon to Texas on my tire went flat and I was really worried it would set my trip back. I was really happy when the guys at this location had me back on the road in less than an hour without trying to sell me anything I didn't need. They were friendly, competent, and they saved my trip. I didn't grab their names but I was there on 2/19/20 in the morning. Because of you I was able to deliver a trailer full of food and water to San Antonio when they needed it most. Thanks guys!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80da588731a4bf93:0xf6fe72e5da3bbd8d</gmap_id></record>

<Text>I bought a brand new car two months ago but on the way to work, I thought I had a flat. It was a small nail in the tire. Joel and Sergio gave me quick and excellent service excellent despite the fact that they were super busy. Great service! Professional attitudes! Polite to all who entered. Top flight location. Great addition to the community!</Text></record>

Anyway these two men were consummate professionals, check me in a half hour early explained everything very politely and professionally.
I needed a rotation and one tire monitoring sensor replace the price was very very reasonable less than half of what the dealership wanted.
I recommend America's Tire particularly this location very convenient off avenue 50.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< review>
Came in as my check tire light came on one guy checked my air and said there was a nail but could be fixed. I parked in the front and was created by Sergio who checked my tire and said it could be fixed but he recommended just replacing it with a new one. I said I was going to replace them all but later in the week, he said he had used tires that he could replace it with for the time being. I kindly refused and told him I just wanted it fixed as I would replace them later on in the week, he walked away from us and went inside not telling us anything. After waiting a while I went inside to see why it was taking to long and he said he wasn’t going to fix it as it was too damaged. I reminded him that he said he could repair it, he agreed and said but I recommend changing it instead and refused to fix my tire. He was kind and professional until I refused a new tire then he was just rude and very cut throat.</review>

Made me wait over an hour in extreme heat, 110 degrees and 25 percent humidity. They have misting outside of the tent so it never blows on you unless you happen to have a breeze. Offered me water but that was an hour ago. I feel like I'm going to pass out. Still waiting for them to come get my car for my brand new tires!< /Text>

Twice in a row I came in to patch a tire and I waited hours only to be forgotten. Never even bothered to take my vehicle in to be check. I don’t think it should take more than 3 hours. I’ve had nothing but bad experiences here.< /Review>

Came in for a flat repair and they told me it was a 45 minute wait so I told him to check me in and I will come back in 45 minutes came back and waited hour and a half so I finally just told them to give me back my keys as I saw that they were giving priority to sales rather than repairs  really slow service be prepared to waste all day if you come in<//Review>

Published 4 tires 60,000 miles ago. Lance gave us money back on those and AAA member discount. These new ones are the same. Warranty for 55,000 miles.
Thank you Lance.< /review>

< Review>
I rarely review places , but I had one of the best customer service experiences and it all was thanks to Luis. I came in for 2 tires due to a damaged tire. Luis took his time to not only advice me on what I should do , but was very thorough. They ended up finding a nail in the tire, and something happened in the process . They apologized and provided me a free tire of no cost to me. Not only did I buy the other two tires , but I bought the warranty as well. They could had liked to me and said it was a bad tires , but they were honest and because of that they have made a long term customer from me.<//Review>

To Start: Just Exceptional!

My wife and I travel full time. When we are on the road, lots of things go wrong. Tires are the one thing that make me cringe because automatically, I know it's going to be expensive. Living on the road full-time, also opens the door for businesses to take advantage of that situation. They know you are in a hurry to get back on the road, or that services aren't always plentiful, or that time is of the essence and money speeds things up.

Lance: The Rockstar!

We were mid road trip, and noticed a bulge on a sidewall of our SUV. The tires were about due anyways, but trying to hold onto every last mile, put us in a world of panic. Not knowing if the tire would even make it another mile, and dead in our tracks, we called here as the closest trustworthy tire shop to our location. Lance went above and beyond what my wildest expectations were. He got a set of 4 special order tires in - THE SAME DAY - which saved us a ton of time waiting and not traveling.

When we got there, everything was ready and waiting including telling me about some more discounts that were available to me rather than jacking up the prices and making me pay more. He even beat the the lowest price listed online, for the tires alone, by a few bucks which really made us happy.

This is why I have been an America's/Discount Tire Co customer for over 20 years exclusively. This, right here. My wife and I were so blown away at the level of service and care, we bought the entire store lunch to show our true appreciation for what they were able to do for us. The time and money they saved us, was worth well over the monetary cost of lunch.

Thank you! For everything!</text>

< review>
A week ago I took in my car because it needed a balancing which I paid almost $80. I assumed the problem was fixed but my car kept wobbling so I decided to take it to another shop. There the guy told me that they hadn't balanced it at all. I am completely disappointed because I expected much more from a big company but all I got was garbage. Never returning again! If I could give it 0 stars I would!</review>

Brandon, a sales person from America's Tires in Coachella was awesome. He treated me with respect and was very quick in helping me with my flat tire plus they fixed it for free!! These guys have great costumer service. I highly recommend them! Not only they fixed my flat tire but they also rotated all my 4 tires and re-balanced them. I am very happy with their service. I'll definitely know where to go whenever I have a problem with my tires. Thanks Brandon and all team!!</text>

These guys went above and beyond for the service of my 2016 Ford Mustang Ecoboost. Bad luck, a ripped off bumper and a flat tire. They were able to get me back on the road with two brand new General Tires and not only that, they disassembled my bumper to make it easier to fit in my car.

Hats off to the store manager for giving me a ride closer to the I-10 for my ride to pick me up.</text>

Brandon helped me as soon as i arrived he was very good at explaining everything.From what tire brand im better of with, what could go wrong if i didnt have the right tires on as well as trying to give me the best deal and advise. Every employee has a great attitude , very respectful and quick at getting the job time done sooner than expected i definitely recommend anyone to go if your  buying new tires.<//text>

< review>
Went to this Smog Station for the first time today, & I was VERY impressed!  Elmer, the technician, was friendly, honest, professional, & FAST!  He even put on some good music while I waited. :-)  To top it off, I used a coupon from their website, so I got my certification for $10-20 less than most other places in the neighborhood.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND FAIRMOUNT SMOG (& ELMER)!!!</review>

Elmer was very friendly and personable and had a great attitude, just the kind of person you want greeting your customers! And the outdoor waiting area is cozy. Elmer even put on fun music for my daughter and she danced haha it was great. Thanks!< /Text>

<Review>The one thing that distinguishes this smog station from any other that I have ever used is the customer service. I have come to this station for several years, it has one attendant and he is always the same, friendly, upbeat and accommodating. He even once was willing to stay open later for meet when I showed up at closing time. I like doing business where I feel welcome, after all the price for a smog check is relatively set within a few dollars from shop to shop. This place does a little extra as far as customer service, a lost part of the business environment. One thing to keep in mind, it is easy to miss this place on Fairmont avenue in City Heights, you definitely want to look up the directions and keep your eyes open when you get close, it is a small and unassuming location.< /Review><Time>1622307646615< /Time>< user_name>

Good service and friendly staff. Elmer, the technician, is very friendly and concise. Location is neat and clean. It's never too busy or crowded. There is a ample waiting area.
$50 fee includes $42 for service, $8 for certificate. They charge only $42 for service if your vehicle fails. They give you 2 weeks for a retest. Fees vary depending on the type of vehicle. I tested a 2015 Toyota Corolla.< /Review>

<Review>I arrived at Fairmount Smog Test Only at 0800 a.m. and Elmer proceeded to courteously and quickly smog check my Ford truck . It passed and I was gone in about five minutes .The cost was $50.00 including the certificate. B and B auto recommended this establishment and I am glad I did.<//Review><Date>1578598374805<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating>< pictures>

<text>I been going here since 2010 so 8 years now I just completed another successful test Elmer did the testing same person that did the testing last time he's friendly and we have a good time. A car died during the test on the Dyno and couldn't get restarted in Old Volvo Wagon from the 80s and together we pushed it out of the Bay up into the parking lot for enough so the guy could roll it down the hill and park it at the bottom until he can figure out how to get it home probably with a tow truck.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Had a great experience. This will be my go to place. We got there and he was smogging an older vehicle so had to wait a little longer so when it was our turn he apologized for the wait and gave us a 10 buck discount on top of the already low price. Once our turn came around it took him less than 10 minutes and we were done.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Honestly the worst and horrible experience 👎👎 since my son suffers from austimo .. And the day I went .. The cashier scold him because my 5 year old son was screaming .. The cashier said "SHUT UP CHILD I WISH YOU MOM HITS YOU "😡 That annoyed me too much and I told her I didn't have to say that .. And she with a mockery on her face told me that it was not her fault that my son was not NORMAL 😢😞 .... Honestly like mother I tell you .. If you have a special son .. Do not go to that store .. Since the cashier is very arrogant and heartless 👎👎😡

Sinceramente la peor y horrible experiencia 👎👎 ya que me mi hijo sufre de austimo.. Y el dia que fui .. La cajera lo regaño por que mi hijo de 5 años estaba gritando .. La cajera le dijo" CALLATE NIÑO OJALA QUE TU MAMÁ TE PEGE"😡 Eso me molesto demaciado y le dije que no tenía que decir eso .. Y ella con una burla en su cara me dijo que no era su culpa de que mi hijo no fuera NORMAL 😢😞 .... Sinceramente como madre les digo .. Si tienen un hijo especial .. No vayan a esa tienda .. Ya que la cajera es muy arrogante y sin corazón 👎👎😡</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Your supreme chicken cutlet is the best! All menus are so good, nothing better. You worth the drive to the place. Your steak is also a must-try! So juicy and tinder. The place has a wonderful atmosphere. It's got an insight into an old Italian city. You will certainly not regret visiting this restaurant!< /review>< Response>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>My first time trying Water Grill. We were a party of 6, so we got a chance of trying a whole bunch of different appetizers. Most of them were really goodappetizers, especially the crab cakes. However, main course lacked a bit of seasonings. Almost every one of the table felt the same way. I'm pretty sure this is an easy fix, so I will definitely give place another try next time.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I been to the one in Vegas and now the one in downtown LA. Both are consistently delicious and have high quality delicious seafood. The shrimp scampi was delicious and the king crab legs hit the spot. the Manila clam and chorizo appetizer was on point and the sauce it was cooked it was perfect for dipping their house made bread into. Crab cake was delicious but only came with one with slaw. overall very good delicious experience.</Review><rate>4</rate><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnXSP6ecPCB8GxGQGOr0D4oye2QY0f_PaUKKmJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL6THxvFtXCtJBFdd8lj4PNg7B-iikADbYNwqG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFBnYI3zJE5PEn8qL2EMtI8SWvLmsUwGDh_7Y7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdd_bOW0L3AVTXO7obiDkLI4vFqqf_9T9TBdeQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUL2rcp2n-_p_w0EyDsroZ7K2D5BldYTNhSrJo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs6dFeRsJwNki9aljxI2IOYQURVDBFf_dvHaqb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9aFSoXe75BR-XCdkbJ7oWtSpCYzIwRt8MiwMj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< GmapID>

Really enjoyed the service and food. Suggestions from the server were spot on and he was very attentive from arrival to departure. The sea bass was cooked to perfection and the scallops were not only presented well but tasted fantastic. The gin gin mule was a 10/10. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.<//text>

<Text>Visited 5/29/2021. Food was delicious. Waitress was a tab bit slow for our table, quicker on others. We were a table of two got slower service than the table of 4 that arrived after us, but got all the orders before us. We appreciate the manager for jumping in.<//Text><Time>1622837315364<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Cool atmosphere and great wait staff but the food is overrated. The bread and appetizers tasted way better than 4 of the 5 entrées we ordered. Fish dishes lacked flavor. Drinks were just okay. The place was alive and service was on the slower side. We were not rushed and it was great to have a relaxed, leisurely dinner.<//Text>

It's all seafood and I have to say the kitchen knows how to cook fish really. Here we had an incredible meal, beginning, of course, with oysters that were very good but a little expensive.</review>

Clean, tasty, good variety and fast. I'm glad they recently put in some minimal seating. All the food was fresh and the chow neon wasn't greasy. The bbq pork was not fatty and was tender.My only suggestion is to put veggie fried rice on the menu as otherwise it's got a good selection for vegetarians (my husband is vegetarian, I scarf shrimp, pork etc).</text>

<Text>Incredible. Amazing. Out of this world. There is an endless amount of words that can describe this dining experience at Sasabune. Chef Hiroki is clearly a master of his craft and is so sweet in how he served us. Each individual bite/dish has its own unique adventure and taste experience and the variety of textures and temperatures are just mind-blowing. Watching the chefs at the bar is therapeutic in itself. And not to mention the gentle ambience and fantastic service. Definitely order the Signature Japanese Omakase. It's the only option you should consider if you truly want a forever memorable night.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
You really have to try a little bit of everything here to truly appreciate the quality of the food. Perhaps trying the "fruits of the sea platter" would be a good way to start. The tuna also excellent but my favorite would probably have to be the Alaskan Halibut.  This place is a fish lovers paradise. Like most fine restaurants the portions at Water Grill are extremely small. You have to have a five course meal to fill your stomach and enjoy your dining experience. The five course meals can get extremely pricey, but you do get what you pay for. The arraignment of the food on the plate seems carefully crafted. I was tempted to lick my plate clean, but it probably would not have been appropriate at a fancy place like this. The desert was excellent and carefully crafted as well.

If money is no concern, you should not be disappointed here.<//Review>

Amazing seafood, great drinks, and a wonderful atmosphere to boot. The Salmon was cooked to perfection. The raw bar had a wide verity of fresh oysters.
It was a little pricey, but well worth it.<//review>

It's all seafood and I have to say the kitchen knows how to cook fish really. Here we had an incredible meal, beginning, of course, with oysters that were very good but a little expensive.</text>

Never knew about this place till the night we went after a visit to The Broad, which is a nice museum.....do check it out. Anyways, this is a very nice place in a historic building in downtown Los Angeles. The atmosphere was great. Our waiter, Chris, was very nice and great to chat with. This isn't super expensive but do plan on spending some money here.  I think it's worth it. And do make reservations. This place was definitely "two thumbs up.....fine holiday fun!".🤓</text>

<Text>Clean, tasty, good variety and fast. I'm glad they recently put in some minimal seating. All the food was fresh and the chow neon wasn't greasy. The bbq pork was not fatty and was tender.My only suggestion is to put veggie fried rice on the menu as otherwise it's got a good selection for vegetarians (my husband is vegetarian, I scarf shrimp, pork etc).<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

<Text>foods are fresh! Was told that they have their own distribution thus they are having fresh seafood everyday! Long wine list available as well. Suggest to make reservations as they always crowded. Reservation can be done on open table.< /Text><date>1538021294973</date><rate>5< /rate>< user_id>

I like the ambiance and the atmosphere and seems like a great place to have small meetings or celebrate a special day.  Our waitor was extremely nice and always checked in on us every so often; our water glass was never empty.  We went here for a birthday and had 5 different dish as well as 2 appetizers.  My favorite was their poke appetizer and the entrees were ok.<//Text>

<text>No need to explain!

Amazing food! Good quality fish! Have lunch special for $20 or $25...Good price for high end taste!

$25 Set includes 3 pieces of sushi (3kinds of fish), 1 blue crab roll, 1 bowl & miso soup. You can pick Tuna, Salmon or Albacore for the bowl that comes with the set. Good size of everything. The temperature of the fish is perfect for my mouth! Rice cooked perfect! Miso soup is not salty! Love it.

They validate the parking !< /text>< Pics>

<Name>Gary Greer</Name><date>1596792942247<//date><Rate>4<//Rate><review>I had the original fried chicken sandwich. It came out nice and hot. The chicken itself was dark meat rather than the white usually used in American style fried chicken. Parents with finicky children might want to bear that in mind. The quality of the chicken was excellent and the breading had a very satisfying crunch. The host was friendly if a bit high strung and the service was relatively quick considering the menu warns you that you need to wait for the food to be prepared from scratch. The price was very slightly eyebrow raising at first. But upon consideration, is on par with other restaurants like it and is mostly fair. I'll be happy to go again.< /review>< Pics>

In the heart of the city off Grand Ave. You will find this upscale working-class hero. Jumbo 🦀 Cakes were deliciously original, however I felt there was too much celery considering the greenery already present in the cake. The 7 Cheese Lobster Mac was rich and creamy with the perfect amount of Loster. Himachi Nacho's had a nice and spicy unfortunately the almonds just didnt fit in here. I would love to have seen a cold mother sauce infusion in this dish to give it that warm cheesy "Nacho" flavor. Loved the Pacific Oyster selection. Tried the top 2... worth every penny. The habinaro dip was a fantastic addition to the normal cocktail trio. I would definitely eat here again.</Review>

Very nice and classy seafood restaurant. Their oysters are super fresh and they have a huge variety. If you're not a seafood lover they still have steak options as well. The crudo sampler was delicious and very creative. It is a bit pricey so be prepared to drop some money. They are also very accommodating to allergies. I have a severe dairy allergy and they were very nice and clean.< /text>

<text>foods are fresh! Was told that they have their own distribution thus they are having fresh seafood everyday! Long wine list available as well. Suggest to make reservations as they always crowded. Reservation can be done on open table.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORswSZWXlWyy94CZexBD8tkRxnX6-6ePo1ZSBT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi9YXVD3ZJVCAJb73iEfG0ZVu4mvPna-M-XghN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbKiyOhBw_JhGk6Hbzg3x5lq30DIVPtlTfsWuK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYItUkC5E1YpZ7QRvG51cxCNNGA5GO-fVUFzSm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTioMEXbdcY7EZZPg7y9mnHsbYGwM8bHPGuvRS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4901ce7c7:0x2ad996c9a82b097c<//Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Now that ROC is closed, Din Tai Fung is probably the best bet for dumplings on the west side. There's always a wait to get seated here, but there's usually open seating at the bar/lounge area. The service can be kind of slow here, so sitting at the bar is a no brainer for me.

Their Xiao long Bao soup dumplings are my favorite thing on the menu, but I also like their spicy wontons and rice cakes. Their noodles and soups are just OK. Try their red bean buns or dumplings for dessert. I love that they give you a huge thermos when you order hot tea.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Phenomenal. Came for brunch and all the food was amazing. The benedict comes with ham - not sliced ham, chunks of ham. I thought it was actually pork belly. So, so good. The brioche toast was like a dessert. The house-made lemonade is perfect: fresh lemon flavor and not too sweet. Service was great, and the outdoor seating area is great. If it were a hotter day, I could see it getting uncomfortably hot on the patio, and they could use some fans out there. Highly recommend for brunch!< /Review>

Very nice decor. Waiter was attentive at first before it got crowded. Made very good suggestions for food and wine. A little pricy but the quality of the food makes it worth it. Entree took a little long to come out.</Text>

"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded" -Yogi Berra.   That sums up this place.  If you go, you stand a good chance of meeting great people.  Friendly inviting atmosphere, and the best Old Fashioned in Coral Gables.  How can you go wrong?  Huge improvement with the outdoor seating!!!  Highly recommend.<//text>

<review>Food is fresh and delicious. HOWEVER, this isn't your typical edemame, California roll, lots of soy sauce sushi place. It's more on the authentic side. Serve staff will actually tell you not to use soy sauce with certain fish. They don't serve rolls. A bit on the pricey side compared to "regular" sushi places, but well worth it. Place is clean, staff very courteous.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>3<//rating></record>

This little nugget was very hard to find as it is located in what seems to be an office building with a few restaurants like Olive Garden and California Pizza Kitchen. We almost turned around due to the fact that not only did it take us about 10 minutes to find the place, but the above mentioned restaurants are such a turnoff, that we thought SS could not be all that great despite the amazing reviews. Boy, were we WRONG!
I have to point out that when you enter the door, there is a sign prominently displayed by the cash register that makes it clear california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and etc are NOT an option! Upon reading that, I knew that we were in for a treat as this to me meant that this was a serious and authentic sushi restaurant.
Wanting to be adventuresome, we sat at the sushi bar where you are not provided with a menu, as the options are the chefs choice. We had some amazing creations and I have to say that this was the best experience and the best sushi that I have ever had. So worth every penny!< /text>

Then our food came and I was in happy land, I didn't hear what she was saying but I feel she had said something .   We both agreed the steamed clams and the crab linguine were amazing.  She said the halibut was good but I feel she liked the clams more.  The next time she should try the pan seared sand dabs.< /review>

<Text>I made a reservation here for my ninth anniversary with my husband and he loved it but he's not the one writing this review, now is he?  First, we both love seafood- he more than I, which is why I chose this place versus my first choice, French food.

I wasn't a fan of the decor.  It felt like it was dusty and hadn't been fully cleaned in a while, like the smudgy glass and all.  It felt like I was stuck in some outdated restaurant from the 80s, which I think is when they first opened, so that description is actually appropriate.

Ambience was okay.  It was a pricier, more upscale place but it didn't feel snooty or unwelcoming.  Our server was on top of it; he was quick, knowledgable and friendly.  Everyone was really nice, so I feel bad about just leaving a three-star "A-OK" rating but I just was not about the food at all.

Our dinner:
-Wild Alaskan Black Cod Kabayaki (Sablefish) with soba noodles, green onions, spiced fish broth
-Wild Ross Sea Chilean Sea Bass with butternut squash purée, gnocchi, sage brown butter
-Jumbo Lump Blue Crab Cake with celery root remoulade
-Bread Pudding a la mode with sea salt caramel ice cream

Both fish dishes were cooked to perfection- the right amount of crisp and flakiness with such a fresh taste.  However, the Wild Alaskan Black Cod Kabayaki was too salty for me and I hated the butternut squash purée on my Wild Ross Sea Chilean Sea Bass.  I don't like butternut squash much in general but when it's paired right, it can be very delicious.  I thought that the sea bass was just soaking in way too much of the purée and it just overwhelmed the dish.  My husband loves butternut squash and even he thought it was heavy-handed on that sauce.

I don't know why I bothered with the Jumbo Lump Blue Crab Cake.  I've never in my life had a decent crab cake yet I feel the need to order it every time I see it on a menu, with this ridiculous hope that someone will actually get it right and that it will be outstanding.  This was not that time.

The Bread Pudding was complimentary for our anniversary, which was a sweet touch (no pun intended).  It was the BEST bread pudding I've ever had but... I don't like bread pudding.  It's very reminiscent of a White convalescent home, much like carrot cake and split pea soup.  No, thank you.

Honestly, the best part of the dinner for me was the warm, chewy sour dough bread.  It was absolutely delicious and I could just eat that all night.

If my husband were to write this review, he would undoubtedly give this place a solid four, if not five, stars.  I wish I could do the same.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX7-DP07mvQQSxDjDjuOVYj9HlQ2bvNJ_EEZYW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyX-4R4XONYdCZv46V-U72nQVEy1e-T9g5mvvF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1I64uVCBLMQq6TDqJsAOXJPlvZXQnjdbehtup=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOhse673mikUJB0qAujfEQNw0Zqg4nYQjMZ-f_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkKLEyRIdC3BZeIkoNATOKEuZxrM4Aul4Etl5h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

<date>1593403413374</date><rating>4<//rating><review>I was pretty impressed by Dave's Hot Chicken! I got Combo #3 which includes a tender, slider, and crinkle cut fries. The chicken definitely has some heat to it and is incredibly crispy and tasty. The meat is tender and juicy as well. The coleslaw wasn't the best, but the pickles definitely made it much better. The sauce was primarily thousand island sauce so left room for desire. If you compare this place to Howlin Ray's however, I definitely prefer Dave's!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

This spot blew my MIND! every thing was so delicious. Service is really good and consistently check up on you. Would definitely recommend. One thing that did stick with me was their Butterfish. It was extremely good, my boyfriend and I had to order it again lol. (Picture is the Butterfish)</review>

Tickle Tree is a nice, cozy cafe with a good selection of food and drinks. Always have good music playing. When not busy, its a nice place to do homework and catch up with friends. The prices, however, are a little expensive for what you're getting.< /text>

<text>Lovely place on Pier 39. All of the food was delicious (Lobster clam chowder and crab cakes were my absolute favorite!) and the cocktails were well-crafted and yummy. However, it's a little pricey ($29 for the lobster roll!). It's a good place to eat for tourists and also has really great views, but if you want great food for cheaper prices, go somewhere else.<//text>< Rate>

I usually feel heavy after I have these hearty meals but the way they cook it makes it just a little healthier.  They also have a good selection of sauces because you know I love to dip!

Delicious!  We had the fried shrimp, fried lobster, calamari and plantains.  This is a local restaurant that obviously enjoys lots of local support. The food was excellent.  The service was great.  My one peeve was the fried lobster was $44.  Yes, $44.  It's was marked MP (market price) on the menu, but they never bothered to say how much it was (albeit we could've asked too).  But when the next most expensive meal on the whole menu is $16, $44 came as quite the shock.  That, and they fact that ALL OF THE FOOD OFFERINGS WERE FRIED. Yes, they were delicious as I stated, but I would've liked to have a broiled or blackened option.  For that, I gave 4 stars.< /text>

We waited a long time to get a reservation here! Heard the good reviews and wanted to try it for ourselves. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it did not disappoint! The service was spectacular (I seriously didn't even see the waiter fill my water glass, but it somehow was full the entire meal even though I was drinking it). Our waiter also recommend an amazing wine that paired so well with our meal! You can tell the dishes are prepared fresh and nothing was too rich or over-seasoned. It had an overall feeling of a tiny family restaurant in Italy. Adorable and well worth it! Highly recommend making reservations as there isn't much seating and this place is popular!</Text>

< Review>
Before we went out of town, my family and I came to La Camaronera Seafood for lunch. I have not eaten here in years. My dad used to bring my family and I here on Saturdays. I had a taste for a shrimp sandwich and it was really delicious and fresh. The bun was fresh as well. My husband had a fish sandwich. He love snapper, so that's the fish he had ordered. We ordered take-out and the food was still hot.

The employees were really nice. Please make sure you have enough cash because they don't take credit cards. If not, they have an ATM machine inside. I will most definitely visit again.</Review>

This is my go-to for quick great tasting Mediterranean food. Whenever I need a fast fix for dinner, I just call ahead for pick-up and at most I've waited 15 minutes. My personal favorite is the chicken shawarma plate. You can make your own wraps since they give you a side of pita. They give really generous portions for the price as well. P.S. don't forget to eat it with their garlic sauce!<//text>

Yummy!! Big, delicious pieces of fish & super fresh fries.  Prices are great, service is friendly.  Our wait was less then 10 mins & it was super busy.  Seating can be tight, you might have to wait a bit for a table to open up.< /Review>

Met with a bunch of friends for dinner last week and everyone enjoyed their food. I had the lamb kabobs which were tender and cooked perfectly. The garlic sauce with the pita bread bread is my favorite! Wish it were a restaurant instead of more like fast food, but great never the less.<//Text>

I was craving this so badly today, so we picked up and it has yet to disappoint me! Tip: their "lite mild" is really mild and their "mild" is actually quite hot. I love the half sandwich and half tender combo. And their fries are nice and thick, and definitely crispy. Thank you for staying open for business!< /Review>

Waited over 2 hours for a chicken sandwich and YES it was worth it, and yes it was better than the rest I've tried thus far.

As many of the other reviews have stated, the chicken is amazing here, but what's even better is the customer service. Coming here was truly an experience! The crew working behind the counter seemed really happy to be there and enjoyed meeting and chattin' it up with the customers, all while serving delicious hot chicken. We got:<//Review>

<text>I wish I could give his place a better review. The only reason I can is because our waiter was awful. She was very Impatient with our business party of 6. We started to order and got through several order and she came up to my coworker that I guess couldn’t decide. Instead of going to someone else or even waiting, she decided to tell us that she was going to open some bottles of wine for another table then come back. She came back like 10 mins later and yes we were ready then. Yes we were a lively group but at a place that is as nice as this place was, I expected better service for our $950 dinner.</text><Date>1516724151845< /Date>< Rating>

<Text>This place has a lot going for it. The food was excellent, first time having Spanish cuisine, the decor and patio are adorable and service was excellent. I really enjoyed the red wine sangria. My only negatives about this place is it's expensive and you have to pay for parking. If you haven't been to downtown Montrose, you definitely should.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4901ce7c7:0x2ad996c9a82b097c< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Family friendly. This was an unexpected and delicious find. It's family owned and the service is excellent. They knew how to keep some of the plates simple for the kids and had more intricate plates for the adults to try. It had a very homey atmosphere and food tasted home made.</text>

I love the food, neighborhood vibes and authenticity at La Pergoletta. They have a huge menu with endless combinations of fresh pasta and sauces, it is almost overwhelming if it is your first visit.   The also have great weekday lunch specials which include pasta, salad and a drink for well under $20--I think this is the best time to go.</Review>

The korean fried chicken was really good. We tried the original, sweet and spicy, and garlic which were all really good. Also the have those huge 5L beer coolers. Nothing is better with fried chicken than ice cold beer and they had a pretty good selection of beers on tap.< /text>

Great food! Raw bar was diverse and fresh. Scallops were buttery and soft. The swordfish was cooked to perfection with a smokey flavor. The service was great.</Text>

<text>If you’re in the mood for raw seafood this place has one of the best raw bars in Los Angeles! Located in downtown LA, this restaurant gives you a warm feeling of home! I visited during lunch and it’s definitely a popular place. Water Grill had the best selection of oysters I had seen in a while and I took advantage of ordering a la carte from the beautifully designed raw bar! Their pacific oysters were so good I dream about them sometimes, and I love the little sauces that come with! Now let’s get to one of the best dishes on the menu which was the Miso Sea Bass!!! The Thai chili, the spicy noodles, the miso broth .... simply amazing! Dont forget to order the clam chowder! Overall this place made me feel good inside and out! -foodiechick</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I really enjoyed my first time at the tickle tree. I got an iced latte with almond milk which was delicious! And my boyfriend got the cold brew which he also enjoyed. For lunch I had their spinach salad which comes with strawberries and chicken and it was delicious!
My boyfriend got Jim's breakfast and he substituted the regular pancakes with banana walnut pancakes. Very delicious!
Overall I really enjoyed the ambience and vibe of this cafe. We'll definitely be back.< /Text>< user_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Never knew about this place till the night we went after a visit to The Broad, which is a nice museum.....do check it out. Anyways, this is a very nice place in a historic building in downtown Los Angeles. The atmosphere was great. Our waiter, Chris, was very nice and great to chat with. This isn't super expensive but do plan on spending some money here.  I think it's worth it. And do make reservations. This place was definitely "two thumbs up.....fine holiday fun!".🤓< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaqYDrMVYjWonAF9puQE8hhs8AV5p0PhUasVA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

I am legit happy this place opened up as one of the few places outside of K-town to enjoy "Chi-Mak" (Korean style chicken and beer). Not only do they serve great selection of beers, but also to go along, their fried chicken is one of the best in the area; crispy outside, juicy, and tender inside without being overly greasy.<//Review>

But, it's worth it every time.  This is truly a magical and special place.  Once again, I was fortunate enough to get a seat at the counter (in fact the exact same seat).  I said my customary hello to Julian, and he promptly offered me some free pickles.  I sat and watched the constant ebb and flow of the highly skilled employees do their job.  It's like watching an orchestra do their magic, with Julian as the conductor.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>This is the best Italian food I've had in a long while! I have pretty high standards when it comes to Italian restaurants being an Italian-American from Boston, and La Pergoletta gets everything right. From the friendly and attentive service, the ambiance, the Italian deli attached to the restaurant, the homemade pasta, the fresh bread...A+++.</review>< pictures>

Extraordinary, authentic Italian food. I've been going here for a few years, since the place was brand new...back when the Italian chef and his wife would pass by your table and chat with you for 10 minutes.  It has since grown and they've opened the room next-door and also have tables outdoors, plus they also have a second La Pergoletta in Echo Park (that I haven't been to yet).<//Text>

Initially I was skeptical because from the outside, it looked pretty basic like a sandwich shop. Once we got inside and were seated, I was pleasantly surprised by the lit candle, smooth mood with dimmed lights, and prompt service. We had a couple of pasta dishes with seafood in it. The fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, octopus etc. was nothing short of delicious. I am salivating just thinking about it! It is definitely date worthy. Fair warning, it does get busy! We were really lucky to stop in at the right time. We will definitely go back.< /text>

This is a great spot located in downtown LA. Atmosphere is casual even though it feels upscale.
Food was delicious and the staff were great! I don't get downtown for lunch often...but I'll be back for sure.<//Review>

Good seafood restaurant, great location on fisherman's wharf. The view of the water was beautiful and the seafood was fresh. Portions could have been slightly bigger (fried basket was mostly fries) and the prices were pretty standard for seafood at such a prime location in SF.< /Text>

The steaks are to die for, cooked to perfection.  The staff is wonderful and friendly.  Try the martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives.  Dont forget the complimentary rolls with asiago cheese.< /review>< Name>

Best clam chowder I have ever tasted. Very clammy and chowdery. The viscosity is just right. When I scrape the inside of the bread bowl and get some of that delicious chowder soaked bread, I put it in my mouth and close my eyes for a moment to take it all in. My taste buds are dancing. It's lit. They are swimming in a sea of clam chowder. I feel like everything in the world is perfect. And then I open my eyes and I come back to the world. I take another bite, close my eyes, and lose awareness of my surrounding.< /Text>

This is the best Italian food I've had in a long while! I have pretty high standards when it comes to Italian restaurants being an Italian-American from Boston, and La Pergoletta gets everything right. From the friendly and attentive service, the ambiance, the Italian deli attached to the restaurant, the homemade pasta, the fresh bread...A+++.</text>

Good seafood restaurant, great location on fisherman's wharf. The view of the water was beautiful and the seafood was fresh. Portions could have been slightly bigger (fried basket was mostly fries) and the prices were pretty standard for seafood at such a prime location in SF.< /review>

<review>Initially I was skeptical because from the outside, it looked pretty basic like a sandwich shop. Once we got inside and were seated, I was pleasantly surprised by the lit candle, smooth mood with dimmed lights, and prompt service. We had a couple of pasta dishes with seafood in it. The fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, octopus etc. was nothing short of delicious. I am salivating just thinking about it! It is definitely date worthy. Fair warning, it does get busy! We were really lucky to stop in at the right time. We will definitely go back.< /review>< Date>

<Review>I ordered the "eggs diablo" and after a short wait filled with wine and conversation, we got our food. The presentation was really fun and made me drool a bit just looking at it and once I took my first bite, the conversation stopped. It was savoury and spicey and the toast was perfectly toasted but soaked up the juices of the heirloom tomatoes and peppers on top. The eggs were done perfectly and thought there was a bit more oil at the bottom of the plate, I joyously sopped it up with the bread till there was no more.</Review>< Pics>

<time>1580625516685< /time><rating>4< /rating><text>Where do I begin? This restaurant has my heart. I am allergic to sesame and they are always on top of their game. Every waiter knows which meals has sesame off the top of their heads and they let me know what I can and can not eat. I love eating without worrying about dying! Best feeling. I HIGHLY recommend the green beans and the vegetarian noodles. They will send you to a better place.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Good stuff. I rate all Thai restaurants on their tom kha gai soup (The one and only authentic Thai recipe I can make on my own), and theirs was delicious although I requested no tomatoes. There really shouldn't be tomatoes in that soup and they were kind enough to honor my request.  I also had Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Noodle and Steamed White Rice.</Text>< pics>

A Wonderful Experience for a fifty year reunion with my Elementary school classmate Susan.  The encounter was special and called for an exceptional venue...The Water Grill fit the bill.
The Sea Bass was so great I just wanted to savor the taste and not stop eating it. The ambiance was superb and the Reunion was genuine..A once in a lifetime Experience..I highly recommend the Water Grill for that Special Occasion...Susan Did !!!</Text>

The golden raisins was a perfect complement to the curried califlour..loved the ceasar salad also...Ended the meal with the bread pudding... The food was incredible..the service was prompt and the servers were friendly. I'm from Chicago and came to LA for my uncle's homegoing. Water Grill gave me my life back.... So, so good.

The sea bass entree was pretty good, but a bit overpriced for what it was. The bread pudding dessert was fantastic. Really well done. The staff was very friendly and accommodating as well, only thing to caution is that it's quite noisy inside. A bit hard to hear each other even sitting side by side.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Yummy fried chicken! This is my go to place when I'm craving Korean Fried Chicken (aka KFC).  The chicken here is super moist with a crunch exterior.  I always get the teriyaki version but I like it with a bit of sweet to it.  They serve it with Kimchi and pickled radish which is the perfect complement to the fried chicken.< /Text><Time>1596798747702< /Time><response>None<//response>< name>

I have really enjoyed my lunch time visits to Water Grill. The staff is so gracious and kind. I love the wait the light penetrates the dining room. It feels packed but not too loud. Great interior design and finishes. Lastly, really really good food!!<//text>

Wow what an amazing experience the staff was awesome in every way!   Just so you know they have the best Bread Pudding I have ever tasted and it goes amazing with Belle Meade Bourbon which they also carry!!!! Can't wait to return and try some more menu items while washing them down with the best bourbon around.... Belle Meade Bourbon<//review>

nother place I'm addicted to and their food never disappoints.

All of their food is very flavorful and highly addictive.  I think I may have ordered at least $200 a month worth of food.

Don't judge me!  lol</Text>

Delicious! Tonkotsu ramen was delicious and rich, house salad was flavorful, spicy tuna was just right on level of spice, and karage chicken was crispy and yummy.</text>

<Review>This place is a gem, tucked away in the heart of downtown. You've got to come here at least once. The environment is very active and lively. Perfect whether alone to sit at the bar and order a meal or if you're with a larger party. It has a large open kitchen, just like the top celebrity chef shows. The food is deliciously delightful in taste. I had the crab cake and was introduced to oysters for the first time here. I hear that the oysters are brought in fresh every morning. You can taste the freshness. I highly recommend this establishment, as the staff members are highly attentive as well. You'll have a great experience here, I guarantee it!< /Review>< date>

We popped in here for lunch based on Yelp's reviews. We were on our way home from a cruise. I was the only hungry one and I ordered the Ceviche. WOW! The best Ceviche I've ever had. I wanted to lick the plate. It was the best meal experience I've had in a while. Service was excellent as well. Bravo!< /review>

Some of the best simple pasta I have ever had. Chef-driven sauces and fresh made pastas are bulk of the menu. Lasagne is especially good with paper-thin pasta sheets. Risotto is excellent as well. Not in the mood for pasta? Try somewhere else.< /review>

Visisted this amazing place recently and had the perfect experience. The service from the valet parking all through the dinner was flawless. I had the swordfish, my wife had the sea bass and we both felt we had one of the best fish we ever have had. This time we went out shopping after dinner next time we will most probably stay for drinks as well. Worth a visit for sure!<//Review>

I have eaten here many times in the past. This time, for an upscale seafood dining restaurant I found the food to be just average. The higher rating I gave was for our server, Norma. She was very accommodating. Back to the food... we ordered mussel steamers...not good with  the creamy chickpea sauce and they served it with stale bread. WHY for heaven's sake do that! :-(  Limited salad and vegetables selection to choose from. Our drinks were good. I'm sad to say I will not be going back.<//Review>

Best hot dog place! So I tried only one hot dog which is the elote dog, and it's my favorite I do want to try the other hot dogs, but gotta say the elote dog is just soo good. Right now with this pandemic I would recommend ordering take out it's a lot better than waiting in line.<//text>

We ordered some beers ($5 each) and the lanzhou ramen ($13). The ramen was good but definitely the Chinese style.</Review></record>

I had the swordfish, my wife had the sea bass and we both felt we had one of the best fish we ever have had. This time we went out shopping after dinner next time we will most probably stay for drinks as well.

This restaurant is located in a small strip center with limited parking, put plenty of free street parking. We arrived at 5:30 pm without a reservation, and the place was filling up quickly by 6:00pm with lots of locals. I had the Fettuccine Nero Di Seppia Al Frutti Di Mare that was loaded with fresh mussels, shrimp and calamari served on squid ink pasta. This rates as one of the best that I ever had. My wife enjoyed the the Porcini Ravioli that she throughly enjoyed. This was enjoyed with a wonderful Pinot Grigio wine that our server suggested from their extensive and reasonably priced wine list.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4901ce7c7:0x2ad996c9a82b097c< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

In the mood for a mouth-watering meal? You've come to the right place with Versailles!

AMBIANCE (4/5)
Homey, large with lots of tables, no-frills, casual. Good for groups.

FOOD (5/5)
The #1 Lechon Asada, or Cuban roasted pork with rice and beans and plantains, has been my go-to for many years. Tender pieces of fall-off-the-bone roast pork with aromatic onions, crispy-edged soft plantains, and the garlic mojo criollo sauce make for a hearty and happy experience! The fried pork and famous roast chicken are also great.</review>

<text>I went for lunch and I had an overall good experience however some little things kept it from being great. For starters our waitress would dissapear too fast before we could finish ordering or of we had questions. Second the lobster roll was great to me nice toated bun a good amount of lobster cooked well. However the fries were off they came out like warm instead of hot and they were less crispy than they looked. I assume that's from sitting around. Great place for a business lunch. If it's for leisure I would probably pass< /text>< response>

<review>I've waited over 2 years for this place to open and it was worth the wait. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and truffle chicken sandwich along chips and brown gravy. The chicken was moist and flavorful! The brioche bun buttery and delicious. Can we talk about the gravy? It was smoky and the consistency was perfection! The staff gave me some of the blonde gravy and it was also a smokey flavor. I preferred the blonde over the brown and my husband loved both. The chips were chunky and salty and just perfect! I loved it! I love it! The wait was worth it. The staff is also super friendly and professional. I will absolutely return. I have my eye on that chicken salad sandwich. You gotta try them out!!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I'm so glad we stopped at Old's Havana; it was like walking straight into a Cuban street party in the 1950s.  One thing is for sure, they've got the mojito recipe down pat. They have so many people coming in for mojitos that they have a row of glasses lined up on the bar, with raw sugar cane and fresh mint, prepped and ready to go.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Best place in Miami for fresh seafood. There's a lot of seafood places in Miami but for genuinely fresh seafood come here. First saw this place on Triple D and made it here but did takeout and wasn't super impressed. (I got pan con minuto & conch fritters). Tried it again after my cruise and ate in. Picked a fresh yellow tail snapper. Omg. It tasted like God himself fished it out the ocean and fried it up. My husband got the Camerones Fritos combo. He said it was great as well. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

A cute spot with live music. It's styled retro and the food is very Cuban. Not a lot of vegetarian options FYI.

I had some delicious meat in the vaca frita here. The ropa vieja is also good. If you sit near the bar area you can enjoy the sounds of the live band who sits kind of near the entrance. There are these cracker-like things that are the "bread" that you can try to munch on before you eat.

I enjoyed the experience even though I don't think Cuban food is the bees knees.<//text>

Alright, so this place is nothing fancy. It doesn't have a nice view. It's in a shopping center right outside the heart of little Havana. And you gotta pay in cash.

So why should you come here? Well, the fish and seafood is fresh and the food is delicious. Honestly, what else can you really ask for. I personally love the Sweet Chili Seafood and Frituras de Bacalao, as a nice start to the meal. If your in the mood for a wonderful fried fish sandwich, be sure to order the Pan Con Minuta. It is a delicious fried snapper sandwich. My next favorite item is the Shrimp Tacos, which are very well prepared and stuffed with shrimp.< /Review>

<Text>Amazing restaurant in LA. There is a long bar with granite counter, with hooks under to hang your bag. The servers are helpful in explaining your options: salads, crab, prawns, shrimp, etc and of course oysters. Eugenia is such a fabulous chef. We enjoyed every bite of our steelhead and mussels. The Caesar salad is also a must; super fresh and flavorful. And we suggest you opt for the sake Bloody Mary. We can't wait to return.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1553170871148, 'text': 'Thank you!!!'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4901ce7c7:0x2ad996c9a82b097c< /gmap_id></record>

<review>This review is dedicated to our sever, Ruth - we had honestly never had a server attentive like Ruth at any Korean places. Usually it's pretty nice if they don't give you attitude, let alone great service. But Ruth went above and beyond from recommending dishes to teaching us how to eat them one by one. She deserves a 4 stars.<//review><rating>4< /rating>< gmapID>

I've had a couple of great main entrees here at the water grill, but I keep coming back for one thing, and that's the clam chowder! By far the best clam chowder I've ever had and I love the fact that whole clams with shells are in the actual suit. The bread is fresh baked, always soft, always moist. A simple lunch with a bowl of the best clam chowder and some great bread is all I can ask for on a cloudy day!< /review>

<review>We went to Fratellino for dinner and their 5 stars reviews did not disappoint. The service was amazing from the minute we walked into the time we left. Me and my husband were greeted by owner Beto who was very engaging. We ordered their special ossobucco milanese and spaghetti bolognese. The spaghetti tasted like it was home made by an Italian grandma and very delicious. My ossobucco was very tender and melted in my mouth. Risotto tasted amazing also. They gave us a complimentary tiramisu dessert which was wonderful as well. I am not normally a big fan of tiramisu due to it strong coffee taste but this tiramisu was very light and delicious. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great Italian food and amazing service. I normally don't eat a lot of Italian food, but I I'll be back to this place for sure.</review>< Rate>

The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the  main entrees that were the scallops and salmon. Both were good but the scallops knocked it out of the park! As for dessert all of us got the caramel bread pudding. My friends really enjoyed the warm, mushy, bread. The ice cream on top of it was delicious though, I would recommend getting the ice cream next time unless you enjoy bread pudding.All in all, a solid Dine LA experience.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< date>

My first time here was about four weeks ago. I came to have a business lunch with the attorneys at my firm. For my very first time I got to say this is a must. I tried A platter with seafood on it it had seashells, crab legs, shrimp and a platter was huge and the way it was organized it was so beautiful. I have never tried their oysters before but the way they made them and other stuff they added on top of it it was super delicious. I had never cheat on oysters ever in my life until that day it tasted so good but don’t get me wrong that’s not hit ordinary oysters taste so it’s all in the way they prepare them and made them must try.

Along with that I also had a Chili Sea-bass. Believe me when I tell you that that is the best soft warm taste in your mouth along with all the perfectly great coordinated spices. Yum, Delicious!<//text>

Stopped for some oysters and clams. The place was packed but the friendly staff found us a place at the bar even though we did not have reservations. The clams were awesome even though they were farm raised not wild caught, but the oysters were small and not very satisfying.
I may go back next time I'm up in L.A. but I'll make reservations first. The decor and ambiance were very good, modern with an old style maritime look.< /Text>

<Review>Amazing seafood restaurant in LA. There is a long bar with granite counter, with hooks under to hang your bag. The servers are helpful in explaining your options: salads, crab, prawns, shrimp, etc and of course oysters. Ron is such a fabulous chef. We enjoyed every bite of our steelhead and mussels. The Caesar salad is also a must; super fresh and flavorful. And we suggest you opt for the sake Bloody Mary. We can't wait to return.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The choice of oysters was outstanding. And taste was the best I have ever experienced. The sea bass was phenomenal and the giant crab claws were something of legendary proportion. The service was top notch and all in all, we had an amazing experience. Highly recommended A* My favorite restaurant of all time can't beat the food and drinks from this place atleast visit once when I go back home highly recommend if near the area</review>

OMG everything I ate from the bread and butter to the cheeseburger and kalimaree to the desert Carmel Bread Pudding was ridiculously good!!! I just couldn't stop eating! This is definately a place to go if you want tasty food. Prices are kinda high but it's worth it. Austin helped and he was the best!< /Text>

I almost never give 1 stars, and I don't give this one lightly. There was only one redeeming quality about our meal of for people: the hamburger was well-cooked and tasty. The rest was quite bad. Everyone else got a fish dish that was either poorly conceived, cooked badly or the flavors simply didn't work. They were unable to make my first three requests on the menu. When I went to my fourth choice, hamburger, they wouldn't let me choose a side other than fries, after having to go to my fourth choice. The service was erratic. At one point someone cleared two of our plates but left the other two for another five minutes before coming to get them. The prices aren't ridiculous, but what was delivered they were a whole level too high. The ambience is like a quick-stop tavern. A huge disappointment from start to finish, unfortunately. There are countless restaurants across Los Angeles that deliver far more.<//Text>

We called the restaurant the next day. The owner called us back and apologized profusely and gave us a complementary full-blown meal with wine dessert etc. This was incredibly generous and not at all expected.</Text>

Being there three times in the last couple months and we always left the place happy and content.

Price is steep, but the dishes are just beyond amazing. The quality of ingredients, preparation and presentation are all five stars. Wait staff are mature, well mannered and very knowledgeable about every dish.

The deserts are on the smaller side. I guess they have to service small size deserts for all the weight conscious LA celebrities.<//Review>

Really cool spot. My cioppino was so yummy; I could of had a bowl of the sauce alone! And the scallops in it! The staff was so nice. Also in a great location; just across the way from City Lights Bookstore. It was a perfect spot for a rainy Sunday afternoon. I'd go again, the next time I'm CA.</review>

<review>I'd say i am a regular customer by now. My love for the place goes back to 2000-2001 when chef Michael Cimarusti ran the place. It has since been revised in concept to be more casual, though the quality of the oyster bar persists and the food really is quite good. The seafood tower for 3-4 will serve two hungry people, but is actually not overpriced in comparison to other establishments of a similar ilk. I find myself coming in for the coffee too... i know, it sounds odd to go to a seafood restaurant for a cup of coffee, but it is probably the best French press coffee in town.</review><rating>5</rating><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

The place is fantastic. The food is amazing and the variety of the oyster bar is unmatched.
Very professional staff in general
Minus the mishap that happened to me. The waiter accidentally pushed over the bottle of wine and it ended up on my clothes.
The manager was very apologetic and offered to dry clean my clothes. My question was how do u put the wine back in the bottle and off my plate as well...Anyway it happens I guess.<//review>

Very fancy, was practically empty when we got there. Nice waitress who was very polite and attentive. Food was great and quickly served. I would go again, but would probably wear nicer clothes when I do.< /Text>

To begin, the atmosphere is elegant and beautiful. It is definitely more of a place for adults than families with young kids, but they do have something for everyone. All of the food we had was of very high quality, and it all tasted delicious. However, service was a bit slow and nothing was mind-blowing. In a city of such diverse food and dining opportunities, this restaurant would not be the first to mind when recommending incredible seafood. (hint: try Son of a Gun on W 3rd Street). Watergrill can be found and enjoyed in a lot of places; it is not a unique hidden gem. If you are looking for a beautiful meal in downtown LA, this is a good choice. If you are looking for a revolutionary meal in Los Angeles, I would maybe try elsewhere. Watergrill is always solid and delivers consistently good meals.<//text>

<Review>I'd say i am a regular customer by now. My love for the place goes back to 2000-2001 when chef Michael Cimarusti ran the place. It has since been revised in concept to be more casual, though the quality of the oyster bar persists and the food really is quite good. The seafood tower for 3-4 will serve two hungry people, but is actually not overpriced in comparison to other establishments of a similar ilk. I find myself coming in for the coffee too... i know, it sounds odd to go to a seafood restaurant for a cup of coffee, but it is probably the best French press coffee in town.<//Review>< Pics>

We came early before they started dinner service but was able to sit outside and have some cocktails before we got seated. Service was excellent and our server was from my hometown of houston.Other dishes we got were the uni/lardo brioche, the rigatoni and the prawns. Recommended I don't know how I ever enjoyed one. It doesn't taste like beef. To be fair, they have so many great sandwiches like the Rubin or Gyros so I chose something from a coupon I had. I didn't want to score them low or high "for this visit " for that very reason.The food is fresh and fast. So much better than a lot of other restaurants that are increasing on their prices but declining on their quality and service.< /text>

Food is delicious but service can be slow depending on what you order. I have eaten there 5 times now and while sometimes it is an amazing experience, other times they are out of the live fresh seafood (like king crab and lobster) and when we inquired about their lack of fresh live selection, we were told they are a small location and often either do not receive the live seafood or are only given 1 or 2.  Definitely their raw oysters are fresh and delicious, with an amazing selection to choose from.< /text>

The staff were very nice, but the food is stupid expensive, especially for what you get. I had the swordfish, and it was over some zucchini slices for $37! It had a smokey taste, and I couldn't even eat half of it. My gf had the salmon that was okay, but it was $46 - for literally just the piece of fish over some green things. Oh, and an $11 mixed greens pre-salad (that she thought came with it). No no no... $4 for a simple lemonade & another $4 sprite. The waiter asked if he should box my basically uneaten fish, rather than ask if I didn't like it (and should have offered to remove it from the bill or another dish). The whole place reeks of fish when you walk in too. I won't be back. I might as well have thrown $130 out the window.</review>

<text>Great food and awesome service! The night I visited and dined alone, the raw bar was moderately backed up. To make up for the wait, the manager brought out a bowl of their Clam Chowder on the house as well as gave me a little something extra in the raw bar platter I ordered. I was in no hurry that night so the additional wait was not a problem, but it was very kind of them to go the extra mile. All this aside, the food was extremely fresh and tastes great! Definitely going back!!< /text>< Rate>

Good food, lousy service. Had to chase down the waitress. From the get go, Nikki acted like she wanted to be elsewhere. Not present. I worked to engage her which worked for a while but she ultimately  disappeared on us. Just wandered off not to be seen again. Finally after of 20 minutes waiting for the check I flagged down a guy (who had been sitting at the end of the bar for well over an hour, ignoring his patrons) who turned out to be the manager.  It became immediately apparent that Lawrence,  doesn't get the concept of hospitality either which is probably why his waitress (a word i use loosely in describing her,  because Nikki clearly doesn't like to wait) would never work for me either.   They drip with attitude. My general impression is that The Water Grill suffers from too much success. Someone needs to remind staff that "how you get it is how you keep it."  With all of the new and great restaurants in downtown Los Angeles, I won't be going back to the Water Grille any time soon.</review>

I completely had fun at this dining establishment, the food is incredible, and also the restrooms were not bad. It was a little fridgity inside, really was not the best. The wait is great. I will certainly take into consideration going back once more if I get the possibility. Me as well as my good friend purchased the toast as well as we were not let down. My one pointer is to keep the cold outside. Thanks!< /text>

Seafood! Seafood! Seafood! Oh, how amazing it is for me to be able to try this restaurant. They truly had the best-cooked kinds of seafood. I was not able to try everything as I was really full that night but planning to visit again soon.<//Text>

Found this restaurant by chance, truly excellent food with unexpectedly flavorful and well spiced dishes that really stand out among similar Indian restaurants. Samosas, Chicken Tandoor, Peshwari Naan, and vegetable Korma were standouts! Shahed was our excellent server with great recommendations!<//review>

I think the food quality and quantity has gone down recently. For $36 a person, I was surprised to have left still hungry. I had the scallops and they we're good, but they weren't fantastic. Another person in our party had salmon but it was overcooked. I think a little more veggies with the entree's and bit more attention paid while cooking would be good.</Review>

The servise was great, staff were very pleasant,professional and quick. The ambiance is beautiful. The sea bass was perfect and so was desert. I have only one complaint, it is just to noisy. I am not that young any more so this noise distracts me. But overall very good Seafood Restaurant.<//Text>

First time at this Water Grill location and it was amazing! The restaurant is beautiful and the service was impeccable. The General Manager Nitin, stopped by our table several times to make sure we were doing well and if we needed anything! Very professional and friendly! I was super impressed with that touch of service! Lot of restaurants it’s hard enough to get the waiter to stop at your table to check on you. The food was absolutely delicious! We started with a seafood tower that consisted of two types of shrimp, crab, lobster, periwinkles, mussels, scallops with several sauces to spit them with. We ordered the crab cake which was something I’ve been craving for for weeks and this did not disappoint at all!!! Brussel sprouts were flavorful and cooked great! The French Fries were to die for! Perfectly thick and crispy on the outside and tender inside. I could live on those fries!! My friend had the steak and it was cooked to perfection. The bread pudding was so good! Not too sweet but very flavorful! There is a parking structure right next to the restaurant off Grand and self parking was only $6!<//text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Food was pricey and subpar. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which is one of their most expensive entrees and it was not only bland but the flavor was very off. The fish did not taste fresh either. The dish came with side of little dough balls fried in what my guess is beef fat - it was dough fried in beef fat! and somehow they managed to make it taste horrendous, the end result tasted like cold fat, but doughier, unnaturally greasy, and has a tendency to stick to your teeth. At  the price tag of nearly $50, it was a great disappointment. The only redeeming quality is their great service, our server was awesome and that's the only reason this place deserve a 2 stars.< /Text>< Date>

< Review>
King Crab was delicious. Two pounds was more than enough.  The stack of shellfish  (deluxe platter ) was both really good and a lot of fun .

From the dessert menu, the rice pudding was really good but the  Strawberry Sable cake was a little on the dry side.

Definitely stick to the shellfish. Get the specialty you like!<//Review>

started with seafood tower, was great. Cocktails are fabulous and poured strong. However, we asked for bread multiple times until received. Then, our entrees were cleared without asking if we were even finished. After 18 years in the industry (10 at Flemings Prime Steakhouse/wine bar) I expected more professional service from this place for what you are paying. We felt rushed. For an $800 bill for 8 people I expect more that mediocre service. Food was great though!</Review>

High quality food, but similarly high price. You would need to order a few courses to get food enough. Very busy place, so order a table in advance or sit in the bar. Nice atmosphere. Wine selection is also fine.< /Text>

Water Grill is a legacy DTLA restaurant for seafood. I visited during Dine LA week and ordered off that menu. I enjoyed a delicious beet salad and a fish main dish. The service is superb here -- actually, I like the service more than the food. It's also a good place for a business lunch or a special lunch with a friend because unlike a lot of other restaurants, the noise level is low. It's a bit pricey, but worth it for a business lunch or special meal.</Text>

First time here and I had a fantastic experience, it was my parents and I we ordered the jumbo crab claw, mermaid cove oysters, and the traditional lobster roll. Everything was over the top, we sat at the bar and Michelle helped with any questions we had and was very professional. Very impressed with the service we got here, would definitely come again.< /review>

I actually didn't mind this diner, the food is impressive, as well as the restrooms were ok. It was a little chilly indoors, really was not the very best. The food serve is excellent as well. I will certainly consider going back once more if I ever land the chance. Me as well as my pal got the special as well as we were not dissatisfied. My one idea is to keep the cold exterior. Come again!< /review>

<review>We went to Water Grill after attending the opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion  last Sunday.  Water Grill is located just a couple blocks south of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion so getting there was a breeze.  Parking was very easy in the valet parking garage located next to and just north of the restaurant.  We were seated at a table but asked to move to a booth which they accommodated kindly.  Service and food was excellent.  The prices are a bit steep but, hey it's downtown LA and the selection of food makes up for it in comparison to some of the other local fancy restaurants.  We were celebrating a birthday and it was quite a treat to get a complimentary bread pudding we had read so much about.  The food was good but the bread pudding was truly amazing and the highlight of the meal.  I would definitely recommend it!</review><rating>4</rating></record></dataset><record>

a really nice location in Downtown LA right next to the Biltmore Hotel. The salmon plate was exceptional, I also got the Seafood Tower. I wasn't too crazy about it. But a lot of the oysters were really good.< /review>

<user_name>Ali Bumurrah<//user_name><Review>as a hospitality person this place is very nice and cozy for drinks and oysters. However, the service was amzing BUT the we were there for 2 hours no joke. the took so long till comes 1. 2 we order half dozen and they brought 5 but when we told them they pologize and they fixed the order. the main course is terrible!!! taste bland no flavor i was surprised about the taste, it took them 40 mins to make a fish? I have went to other places it was faster way faster and taste better. the desert was amazing. I would come back for oyster and hopfully they won't mess up the order.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Not the greatest place I've been to for seafood. Perhaps it was what I ordered, but I wasn't impressed based on other reviews. While the atmosphere felt alive and energetic, it was perhaps still too loud. It was really difficult to hear others at my table. Walked out from dinner with a sore throat and ringing ears.< /Text>

Good food. Nasty service. I was there with a party of 9, June 2nd at 3. We had the reservation. We arrive, and the front door guy takes us to the table, we start to sit down and one of the waitresses, a redhead, starts scowling at us then says some nasty offhand remark.

I asked the guy if there was a problem, he shrugged. The rest of our time there this waitress keep on giving our table the stink eye.

I was very uncomfortable, and didn't feel safe. She just would glare at our table like we killed her dog or something. Just a nasty woman. Ruined my experience, and the rest of our special day.

The food is great, albeit expensive, but I enjoyed the fare immensely.

But that nasty redhead waitress completely ruined the experience.<//text>

The phrase "You get what you pay for" comes to mind. High end pricing matched by top shelf service and food. Highly recommend.</review>

I would say that dining here, absolutely, is one of  my best seafood experience. I loved the clam chowder, crab cake, Mexican Sea Bass entree & the scallops. Excellent food! Top notch service!< /Review>

The atmosphere made me feel like we'd stepped off the busy streets of a modern Los Angeles into a different time. The place is welcoming and comfortable.  The homedmade fresh breads are both delicious and served while you wait for your food.  We shared a sampler platter of oysters and each one was unique and fresh.  The prices are comparitive to other fresh seafood restaurants across the country, but the food quality and service are superior.  The Water Grill is a must go place in the sea of cuisine in the downtown area.  I will definitely go here again when I return and I'll share the bowl of clam chowder.<//Review>

A disappointment. The fritters were tastless, the menu was unimaginative, and the food was uninspired. They were accommodating and removed the seafood fritters from the bill. I ordered the swordfish which was over cooked. It sat on a bed if spaghetti squash and a garnish that needed help.  I would not return.< /Review>

I was so happy to see them as a food vendor at FYF! Def an underrated restaurant in LA in general. I had their shrimp and grits before and it didn't disappoint at the festival either. The staff is always so nice and friendly and my husband left the booth a believer - he once had a bad experience with shrimp and grits that ruined the dish for him (not here), but after having 2 Cents, it's been redeemed!< /Text>

Food was good and nice atmosphere. We started with the seafood platter but doesnt hold a candle to mastro’s seafood platter to be honest.  The chilean sea bass was cooked very nicely though and the drinks were great. I’ll be coming back.</text>

I love seafood and decided to try this restaurant with three friends during DineLA week.  We had a reservation for lunch on a Sunday.  I tried the clam chowder which was very bland. I'm not one to have to add salt to my food, however, I felt like couldn't add enough!  We each ordered the salmon; when it came out it looked dry.  It tasted like rubber.  It wasn't just my dish, but all four of us! It was small lunch portions and no one could not finish it.  The waitress asked us about our food and we told her it tasted was overcooked, reheated, or something.  She offered to replace our portions however we declined.  Since it was a dineLA promotion (to attract new patrons), we were not going to make a huge deal.  We just paid our bill and decided we would not eat there again or recommend it.  The waitress was nice enough to bring us bread pudding dessert on the house.  It was only okay.  I was very disappointed since there were rave reviews about this restaurant.<//text>

Not a good meal.  Clam Chowder tasted weak and needed more bulk in it.  Fresh Caught  New Zealamd Pink Breem
was smothered with salt
Ruined the delicate flavor.
The manager did her best to.make up with a better cooked dish but we were going to a show and there was only 10 mins. to eat it
Disappointing!<//Text>

Awesome Place, the NEW Brunch is one of the best!  Excellent selection of items,  Prepared to Perfection!  If you're one who likes a Great Bloddy Mary, theirs is Out of this world,  garnished with a Large Prawn, Thick slice of Bacon! A meal of its own! A must try !</Review>

Water Grill has a cool, moody atmosphere that probably makes it equally good for business and romance. I've been a few times for Restaurant Week and have come to realize that I vastly prefer ordering their cold seafood platters over the cooked fish filet dishes. Somehow I think the straightforward presentations of quality oysters, mussels, shrimp, etc on the cold platters are more satisfying than a more staid filet.

Unexpected bonus: the table bread is freshly baked and shockingly good. (Hint: ask your server nicely for extra bread!)</Text>

We sat down quickly and ordered just drinks, our bill was $60 for a Gin&Tonic, glass of wine, and Long Island Iced Tea.

This was unfortunately the only negative experience while out in LA. The food wasn't made with the best effort even though it was high quality fresh seafood. Also the General Manager had to be the worst restaurant GM I've met. Little concern for the paying customer and the product they produce......the experience. He needs to find another career. The Assistant Manager and or waiter did what they could to recover but it wasn't worth it. Don't bother stopping unless things change.#NewGeneralManagerNeeded</Text>

Came with my family and we were all very underwhelmed by our dishes. The bread had near raw onions in it, the shrimp sand which had 3 pieces of shrimp for 8 inches of bread, the clam chowder- a bowl of vegetables and broth with a single, lonely clam. Unfortunate for us, the best part of the meal was the burnt Mac n Cheese. Not to mention the waitresses were intrusive and the people here smell. That's all for now !< /Text>< Pictures>

We had a very lovely meal here at Providence, with dishes were delicious and we'll balanced. The Wagyu beef cigar, as well as the Miyazaki beef with pumpkin were exceptional dishes.<//review>

I would give this place no stars but I have no choice.. service was awful..I sat and waited quite a while before I even got water but they did bring me bread ..I waited for waitress to finally come over..asked questions .. ordered wine..went to the bathroom ..it was disgusting ..no toilet paper.. waited for my wine about 10 minutes more after I return to the table..At this point.. I saw her searching for the bottle and I turned to her andI told her not to bring it that I was leaving ..I actually left them a tip for eating a piece of bread which I now regret. Did I mention that once I got the water it  took several minutes to refill my glass? This is supposed to be an exclusive expensive fish restaurant.. beware.. BTW they were empty tables all around so I don’t understand what the problem was with the service..<//text>

We ordered the beet salad which was excellent! Who knew water cress would go so well with beets and yogurt. The baked clams came in a huge portion - big enough for two and it was also delicious. I also ordered a miso soup but I sent it back because of the overly saltiness. Lastly, the dessert pick for the night was the most delicious and decadent bread pudding I've ever had in my life thus far. It was sweet but not too sweet, accompanied by an out-of-this-world scoop of caramel ice cream. If you are watching your caloric intake, ask them to leave out the caramel sauce. I didnt think the sauce was needed.<//text>

< Review>
The host at this place is the most rudest, unwelcoming and class racist person I have met, and obviously he's never heard of the term do not judge a book by its cover. (And he's Brasilian) He had the odosity to ask me to look at the menu before we got seated, I looked at the menu and I repeated back to him: table for two. And he goes, did you look at the menu? You still wanna eat here? You still want to get a table?
Well, after those remarks just because my daughter and I are dressed very casual he is insinuating we cannot afford a place like this. I felt very humiliated. And yes, if I'm here is not to listen to some smart ass comments, if I ask for a table I expect to get a table without feeling so angry because of somebody's smart remarks that does not know me or knows if we can afford it or not, but hey we're here, lf I ask for a table just seat us.
I told the waiter what happened after we ate, she was by far the nicest one to us in that place. She was very apologetic and said she was going to tell the manager.
I hope she did because situations like this should not happen.
I went in just to make a point but I will not be coming back or recommending this place to any of my friends. The food is mediocre for the price. I've had better.</Review>

I don't eat seafood (though those I was with do!) so I had their filet mignon. It was a bit disappointing, as well as the slow service. Despite it being slow on a slow night, our server was really friendly, haha. Other than that, I did enjoy their key lime pie (pic attached), with the pretty green sorbet next to it!</review>

Delicious, tingly sparking water. That's how I would describe the Water Grill revamp. This DTLA classic recently remodeled, and a little nip-tuck sure does a classic place some good! Just like water, a classic, the water grill sometimes gets overlooked for some new hipster joints in the historic core of DTLA, or the latest and greatest modern-ish spots, but with the new facelift and revamed menu, it is like classics-revamped.... like sparkling water.

The interior is now open, almost like an East Coast seafood bar, with the day's catch displayed for your oogling and picking pleasure. They have oysters, clams, scallops on the half shell, all uniquely prepared, and ready for you at lunch. It's much more open, and feels less now like an old school steakhouse, which, to me, is great if you are eating steak at night, with the mafia bosses next to you. Not as great for an upscale, but still casual, business lunch. I think the decor and everything now is perfect.

The service, as always, remains impeccable.

What really surpised me the last few visits, though, was how great the food has become. I remember being very let down the first time I came, and vowing never to pay that much for eh-eh seafood again. Luckily, work brought me here and I've come around and changed my mind about this place.

My favorites:
-WHOLE STEAMED LOBSTER, served with drawn butter. These are Maine Lobsters (giant, succulent claws) and so delicious. They come pre-cracked, so it isn't SO messy for a business lunch. They also offer you bibs, and to "bib you" and "de-bib you". Cute sidenote: the bibs have fishing buoys for all the fisherman the restaurant has ever worked with, even those who have passed on (including the grandfathers of the founders!).
-WILD MORRO BAY BLACK COD pan sautéed with tomato jam and seasonal succotash. When i had this AMAZING dish, it was served with sea bass instead as a daily special. if this is available, GET IT. the tomato jam is perfect compliment, to a seared fish, and the -succotash is just enough to give some character to the dish. it was delightful.
-CLAM CHOWDER: took an East Coast client here, and they said the clam chowder was some of the best they'd ever had! Includes whole clams, 4 on the shell, looks great, and tastes wonderful. Not so thick-chowdery, but still creamy and delicious.

Wonderful dtla business lunch addition. Will be back, often, especially if it is on the company dime!<//text>

I think I missed my calling of being an executive working in DTLA because as such, I would lunch everyday at the WG.

Once again, DineLA brought me to this establishment, that had been high on my to dine list, which I never seemed to get around to, but finally did.  And, so glad I did.

Ordering off the DineLA menu, the clam chowder to fresh and filling.  The entree - striped sea bass (not Chilean) was firm and well complimented with grilled peaches, cous cous and peach compote.

It was not only satisfying, but it just made me feel like a legitimate adult having an adult meal.<//text>

<review>I was impressed with the Water Grill! It is now my favorite seafood restaurant aside from The Lobster.

To start we shared an iced platter of 6 oysters (kumamoto, wianno, chef's creek),  sea urchin, peruvian bay scallops, and jumbo white shrimp. It was delicious! A second round was ordered. WG definitely knows how to bring their A-game serving up the freshest from of the sea.

For our main course we had the chilean seabass served with butternut squash gnocchi. The fish was so moist and buttery, definitely one of the best I've had. The gnocchi had great texture and excellent flavors as well.
The filet mignon was tender and cooked perfectly as requested but could use a bit more salt.

There were no room left for dessert as we were stuffed.

Overall, a terrific time and amazing food. Can't wait to be back!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Top class in Los Angeles
There are only seafood restaurants (and introduced in various places), and the food and service are excellent. The wine is also plentiful. We, English are subtle but politely responded. The price is reasonable, but I think it is worth it.

<rate>5</rate><Review>(Translated by Google) This restaurant is located in downtown Los Angeles and has a reputation as a seafood restaurant. The menu of grilled Chilean sea bass ($47) was very good for those who are accustomed to grilling fish in Korea with its delicate and unique taste. The inside of the fish is soft and the outside is savory and well baked. The raw oyster was made to be dip in three sauces, but it was refreshing. The ice cream pie that I ordered for my birthday was unique and delicious. Impressively, the waiter introduces his name, takes orders and talks kindly. It was a very memorable place.

이곳은 로스엔젤레스 다운타운에 위치하고 있는 해산물 전문식당으로 정평이 나있는 곳이다. 칠레산 농어 구이(47불) 메뉴는 한국의 생선구이에 익숙해있는 사람으로서는 섬세하고 특이한  맛에 아주 좋았다. 생선 속살은 부드럽고, 겉은 고소하게 잘 구었다. 생굴은, 3가지 소스에 찍어먹을 수 있도록 하였는데 상큼하였다. 마침 생일기념으로 주문한 아이스크림 파이는 독특하였고 맛있었다. 인상적인 것은 웨이터가 자기 이름을 소개하고 친절하게 주문을 받고 대화를 나눈다. 아주 기억에 남는 곳이었다.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7ByBswhtgBKScn9jb1Y70e5fkPw43LEd1B-Fi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjsvuFohwlPJecxBv3cgVTiYf3niQpIMZY1Ld1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYOYH7pzJjntutp4RnzBy_05DSeV6Xkz7Uc8Bw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEAE3FpPquXekWtI__MLBO4hPqKnsbI3rhUcKW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6kQdg2C6TDEsG1JVINVtUYQqCIqikrnLNZVmT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjIXcn-JSx98UIhaMkeewmeqi9d8bRytSjej3q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) The Oyster and Scallop here are still good, but the fried fish close to 50 $ is too average, too much oil, and very greasy. Yu Sheng's words were very special, but they didn't add anything, they were very dry, a little strange, and I asked for a lemon later. The service is good, the value of the younger brother and sister are very high, very high!

(Original)
这里的Oyster和Scallop还是不错的，但是接近50$的煎鱼太一般了，油太多，很腻。鱼生的话很特别，但是什么都不加，就很干，稍微有点奇怪，后来还是问要了柠檬🍋。服务还是不错的，小哥哥小姐姐颜值都很高，很高！< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Though foods are generally good, the dish I had, big eye tuna, was something quite unexpected, partially because I got explained it is a sashimi-style dish. It was supposed to be served with the served Mean while it has spicy source on top made with dish even worse. Other dishes, especially a grilled lobster, were fine.

Both the atmosphere and the food are basically good, but the main dish of tuna was not good enough. I would have liked a little sweetened lemon sauce, but it was actually a honey-like sauce that was too sweet and was not eaten. Other lobsters were delicious and the service was good. The price is not cheap, but I think it is not bad considering prices.

The atmosphere and service were nice. Although foods were also generally good, the dish I had, big eye tuna, was something quite unexpected, partially because I got explained it is a sashimi-style dish. It was supposed to be served with candied lemon, but it was way too sweet; the source had completely ruined the taste of tuna. Meanwhile it had spicy source on top that made the dish even worse. Other dishes, especially a grilled lobster, were fine.

雰囲気、料理ともに基本的には良いのですが、マグロのメイン料理はイマイチでした。少し甘くした程度のレモンソースなら良かったのですが、実際には甘すぎる蜂蜜のようなソースがかかっており、食べられたものではありませんでした。その他ロブスター等は美味しかったですし、サービスも良かったです。値段も安くは無いですが、物価を考えれば悪くないと思います。</Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Tasty and friendly. There are many people, but you don't have to make a reservation until around 6:00. There are dishes for 3-40 dollars, and there are more expensive platters and meat menus. Do it. It is recommended when you want to have a decent dinner for about a day.

(Original)
맛 좋고 친절합니다. 사람이 많지만 6시 근처까지는 예약까지는 안해도 되구요, 디쉬들 3~40달러 짜리들 있고 더 비싼 플래터나 고기메뉴들 있습니다만, 굳이 더 비싼거 시키지 않고 해산물 디쉬들 1인분씩 시키면 만족스럽게 먹을 수 있을 듯 합니다. 하루정도 괜찮은 저녁을 드시고 싶을 때 추천드립니다~< /review>

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the food is definitely delicious, but the oyster and platter menus are similar to the food you can eat in Korea, so if you are a Korean, it is a disappointing place for the price.
Seafood was fresh for the price.

(Translated by Google) In general, we think this is a good place, a lot of people, so it is recommended to book. I ate cipiono and some seafood, a bit hot, it should be good. My colleague has eaten salmon and it is also very good. Overall it is a good seafood restaurant in Los Angeles.

<user>106262480040178778734</user><review>(Translated by Google) I had half dozen, seabass and clam chowder mixes of oysters that I recommended. All were very delicious, but the seabass was quite high for the amount and cost $ 47, so it is a 4 star.

オススメしてもらったオイスターのmixをハーフダースとシーバスとクラムチャウダーをいただきました。どれもとても美味しかったのですが、シーバスが量のわりにかなり高く＄47もしたので星4つです。<//review>< Name>
