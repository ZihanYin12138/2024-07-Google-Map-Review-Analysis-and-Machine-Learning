The pool heater is still not working.  The amenities (shampoo, conditioner, shaving soap) have all disappeared from the showers.  12/29 the hot tub in the women's locker room was once again closed by the Dept. of Health.  No one seems to get a response to e-mails.  I can only presume the new owners spent all their money on the new equipment and "decorating" so they have nothing for upkeep.  Why did I ever think it was a good deal to sign up for a full year!  Do NOT join this club.</review>

This place is closing on the 15th. When I started coming here years ago it was clean had towel service and a friendly atmosphere. Last couple of months towel service was cut off, sauna broke and was never fixed and the Hydro Massage tables kept breaking down. I enjoyed this gym because it was close to home but now will have to find somewhere else to workout.</text>

<Text>UPDATE:  the quote Google has chosen is NOT in reference to this facility, but another by the same company. Please read full review! Google, please correct.

This place could be fantastic. COULD. I genuinely like this gym, but its sorely lacking in TLC and effective management.

I give it three stars because they have a pool and awesome amenities like hot tub, cold plunge, sauna, and steam room.

However, they are sorely lacking in maintenance, cleanliness, and overall some very basic things (soap in the bathroom anyone?). If something breaks, don't expect it to be fixed. There's a water fountain in the women's locker room that has been broken and non-functional for well over a month. The door to the sauna is made out of glass and metal (yeah, METAL in a sauna) and the handle has been hastily taped over with foam insulation to keep you from burning yourself. The towels are dingy and old (if you can find any). Clogged drains, broken shower heads, missing hooks and shower curtains, broken mirrors in the workout areas... the list goes on.

Ironically, the brand new club on Meridian is top notch! They have the latest and greatest equipment and sparkling facilities. No pool and spa style locker rooms though.

It's clear that Fitness Evolution's corporate offices has dedicated all their resources to this new facility. But when you leave your "Elite" location in such disarray, that's simply poor business practices. All we want is for things to actually work and be clean. That's not asking for much.

You are only as strong as your weakest link.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The "cardio" area, which is the first thing you see looks great,  the room in which you do lifting is...okay? I guess. but the weights are rusty,  and the machines are a bit jammed sometimes. the other rooms are alright, but not the best. Overall, it's not a bad gym for the price.</Review>< pics>

This is the abandoned step-child of the Fitness Evolution chain. It it The most poorly maintained, dirty, sad fitness club I've ever been to. They've cancelled all of the group exercise classes and yet they call this location an "elite" facility.  Junk is piled up everywhere for months, no one maintains any of the rooms, the two custodial staff per day are only there for limited hours and can't come close to keeping up. 100% of the deck chairs at the pool are broken and have been for almost a year. The only positives here are the location, the steam, the pool, the nice clientele -- and the fact that there is actually a lot of good equipment and space to work out if you can put up with the crappy facility.  If all you want is to get in, work out and get out -- you'll be ok. If you want amenities, forget it. Some of the staff try their best, but FitEvo corporation gives them nothing to work with.  The employees are like sailors on a sinking ship. The positive reviews for this location are bogus, definitely posted by employees.< /Text>

<text>The only reason I use this place is because it's close to work.  I'm a guy and normally don't care that much about cleanliness, but man this place is gross.

For Example:
The locker rooms have broken lockers and really slimy floors.  The carpet is pulled up in a lot of areas.  The bathroom has had caution tape over one of the urinals for over a year.  Half of the sinks have mold on the faucets.  The weight room is littered with dumbells and plates all over the floor.  Only half of the treadmills ever work at one time.  The pool heaters have worked intermittently for over a year and a half and not to mention all of the dirt and toilet paper that litter that pool.  Man, c'mon.  A little upkeep and this place could be great.</text><username>Parker D<//username>< Resp>

Great gym, wonderful trainers. What really makes this place so awesome is the fact that the trainers are so knowledgeable. I was very impressed. This particular facility also has a heated swimming pool all year round. There's steam rooms and there is even a small workout area in the women's locker room. Thats actually nice for women who get together to workout and don't want to do all their cardio out on the main floor. There are small seats for seniors in the women's shower room - which is nice for people who are older or even the disabled. There are big light up mirrors and even television sets in the women's locker room. As I mentioned the trainers are super knowledgable. Knowledgeable and friendly. That is a win-win.<//text>

Well I haven't worked out there yet and don't think I will. I walked in to the gym to ask about membership fees and maybe a tour of the facility, and I waited at the front desk for 10 min. Then walked around trying to find someone to talk to, when I couldnt I walked back to the front still no one there. Soooo, guess no pool or gym for me from this location.</text>

<Review>I went in to join and was met by a manager name Karina. The look of disdain she gave me was searing base on what I was wearing. This is classic case of profiling and shame on her for judging a book by its cover. She answered my question very curtly and turned her back on me in discuss before I had a chance to ask another question. Her extreme rudeness toward me exemplify the ELITIST attitude of management and how they choose to alienate certain demographic. You will not find love thy neighbor as thyself at this gym!</Review><username>Dan Dob< /username><Gmap_id>0x808fcc97f047f34b:0x641e4a0986071064<//Gmap_id>< user>

What used to be San Jose athletic club is now fitness evolution. The club has some new equipment but the asthetics haven't been changed in 20 years. I go here solely for the pool. In that regard it meets my needs. Guys please wear rubber sandles in the locker room. From the amount of water on the ground it's easy to pick up athletes foot or a wart. For your skin health do yourself a favor and bring some $5 sandles.</Text>

I had an appointment with the fitness manager for orientation, and that didnt happen.  Was 5 minutes early, guy at front desk checks me in, doesnt say nothing to the fitness manager, 10 minutes later I go up to check status, long story short Ariel the Fitness manager tells me I have to reschedule.. For their mistake?? Nah, im good.. Take my money to a place that respects peoples time..</Review>

<Review>Member since 27 November AD-2015

[86 days]

Located adjacent to the First Unitarian Church of San Jose, and across the street from Saint James Park, is the Masonic Lodge built in the 1924th year of our Lord. As of the time which this synopsis was written the building is owned by Mr. Barry Swenson, who counts Gold's Gym as a lessee: Fitness Evolution is a subsidiary of that corporation.

The cost is approximately $43/month, which is drastically less than could be expected considering the potential clientele. Potential downsides are that the organization is not in control of the lease (assumption), there is riffraff which brings a low-class element, and as has been mentioned in previous reviews there are some things that are to be desired, although during February 2016 there are renovations to the locker-rooms which suggest a gradual update is being implemented or phased in.

The other gymnasium which bears the same name in the immediate vicinity is significantly smaller and without the novel amenities which are particular to this location. Said features include the Pool (consisting of 5 lanes), the Sauna & Steam Room (a set of 2), a Massage room, plenty of space for relaxing poolside (e.g., outdoor space which is fenced off with a high wall), and the basketball court which is part of the eastern section of the facility (an add-on from the original temple complex).

The staff does not espouse animosity or duplicity, and is consistently professional. Although relatively young (taken as a mean), the haughty air that had plagued the previous establishment is absent: they are courteous and make an effort to welcome persons with more than a modicum of sincerity.</Review>< rating>

The San Jose Athletic Club is under new managment Fitness Evolution since June 2014. Since the new managment the facility has rapidly deteriorated and the new managmenmt has been incapable to maintain the minimum standard to preserve and retain the membership. The pool is not accessible the heater is not working for the last month - Jacuzzi is also cold and the jets are in need of service. Half of the showers are not in use due to knobs missing. The constant and ongoing  issues with maintenance of lack of has created an environment where most members are constantly complaining to the staff to no avail. Corporate seem to not care or not willing or able to respond. Meanwhile many members where given the opportunity to sign up for a new contract for $ 360.00 the all year and no refund is allowed.<//Review>

<Review>Im sooo shocked and pleased with the new management of the  shop. Ive been coming to  this location  for over 8 years even before this was  a hair shop location.  Porsha  is definitely in her field of purpose. The energy  is soo inviting  and personable  but still professional  and im always taken care of in a timely  matter with efficiency.  I even had to let her k ow because  i was "mouth open" with amazement  at the place.< /Review>< Date>

So if you rather buy in person and you go in and ask for Jon Renau Scarlett, they won't help you. Even if you ask for it by name.  I understand brick and mortar stores competing with online stores but honestly if a customer cared enough to walk in and ask for a wig and color by name, if you obliged, you would do better business. It's a shame that a store closest to me has such crappy customer service .< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1484071269228, 'text': 'So sorry to hear that your experience with us was less than perfect.  Unfortunately, we do not carry Jon Renau in Scarlett style.  We may not have this particular style available, but, we carry similar styles that you may be interested in trying.  Shopping for a wig or top piece takes time and patience, and for this reason we offer one to one service to all of our customers. Please pay us another visit and see what styles and service we have been offering to our clients.  We look foward to seeing you soon.'}<//response>

<Text>SO rude. When customers are polite and respectful and have a good attitude it's usually good business practice to be polite back - I think you really need to have a heart to heart with your staff about customer service and even manners or maybe recruit new talent, this is why companies such as Bellami and others are beating you, nobody wants to be treated poorly or give money to those who are rude.<//Text>< Date>

< Review>
This is the worst store I have ever been to. Customer service deserves ZERO stars. The store policy trying 3 wigs max, is pathetic. The hot day and no good air conditioning service made me very thirsty, and when I asked for a glass of water, the response was: "No water,  bring your own."  I do not wish to waste my time to write more negative things. I am done!</Review>

Restrooms are generally clean and working and when in operation - the snack bar serves up good hot dogs and chili on the weekends.  The area does have a homeless issue - so good to maintain an eye on your belongings when in parking lot.</text>< pictures>

It's hit or miss honestly because sometimes the parking lot is nice and empty but sometimes it's packed and everybody is just staring each other down from their cars. Pretty stupid< /review>

<Text>Pros: Nice field, with announcers & music!  Snip-its if songs are played in between innings and batters.   Easy to get to...right off the 405 fwy (East side of fwy) exit  Santa Monica Blvd.

Cons: limited parking in lot, one portable restroom, and snack bar was closed during our tournament.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Very unprofessional service. I walked in to make an appointment and the lady (I think here name is Tammy) she said she was fully booked. That was completely fine, but when I asked for the salon phone number so I can call after I check my schedule her attitude became very rude. She was cutting another customers hair and just started yelling that I shouldn’t be asking for the phone number. Very unprofessional! The customer in the chair and I shared an awkward look before I walked out.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808580f4c23d8951:0xe072652db1ab5782</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My go-to hair salon when I used to live in SF (I no longer do). Very affordable pricing and the lady is very skilled, she would also suggest minor tweaks to what I want and disucss with me on what's best for my hair instead of fixing a cookie cutter Pinterest hairstyle that I requested without knowing better< /text>

Small salon with 2 stylists. Very good service. Highly recommend that you call ahead. My stylist is a guy, and he spent a decent amount of time layering my long hair. Did a superbly thorough job washing/conditioning, and then trimming my hair to style. Very detail oriented. Would definitely come back when I visit San Fran again.</Text>

Her continued work with Rusk allows her to keep up to date on the latest techniques. I am a very picky person, and Lisa has been the first hairdresser who has consistently given me exactly what I want, even when I decide to change my style completely and don't have a clear idea of what I want. If you aren't completely satisfied with your current hairdresser, I would highly recommend that you pay Lisa a visit.<//review>< Pics>

Sam is a genius. Every time I leave this salon I get a compliment on my hair before I've even made it down the block. No one does better "creative" color. These guys are the best!< /Text>

<time>1551071088792<//time><review>I went to this place to get a simple trim after reading about its “great” reviews and “fair” price. I told the guy I just wanted one or two inches cut but he sorta gave me the impression that it wouldn’t be much of a change. So I agreed to trim 3 inches. Now I looked at myself in the mirror and felt like it’s definitely more than 3 inches. I guess that’s just so instead of the 9 dollars price tag, they charged me 15. I’m very disappointed at this experience and will not go back again ever.<//review>< user>

Came here after reading the good reviews. But the woman working here was VERY rough. Pulled my hair a bit, which is fine I was like whatever. But she poked me in the eye with her comb?!!!?? Also combed the back of my neck. Was overall a super rough experience, getting your haircut should be a relaxing experience but this was far from it. Also she said women haircut is twice the price of men’s cheap haircut, which is fine if it took longer than a normal male haircut but it was legit a trim of a couple inches and same amount of time as a men’s haircut (30 mins ish). Overall would not recommend. I’m going to go to somewhere nicer that offers a better experience and customer service next time.< /review>

I like the place a lot. The haircut is great and the woman who cut my hair paid a lot of attention to details.  Yet she finished within 15 minutes, which is very efficient.  The man's haircut costs $8 and I put $2 for tips.  $10 in total and still very good value.</Review>

Very efficient little hair salon. Call for an appointment and the owner will usually provide a slot within the day unless it's a Saturday. Also, if you have no preference, she has a male hair stylist as well.

Haircuts are quick, you're not kept waiting beyond 5 mins of your appointment slot and your haircut is not expensive. She does a good job with trims which is only what I've gone here for.

Cash only.</Review>

I loved the job Maggie did on my hair!! It was my first time at Mona Lisa and I had the best cut and balayage experience possible. She really took her time to do the job right! I've definitely found a new home salon.< /Text>

Great place to get a haircut. At $8, it's very affordable. It gets busy between 5pm to 7pm. Either call and make an appointment or go there earlier.

Yi & Mika did phenomenal work today! They not only walked me through each and every process, but created magic on my box dye color hair. From black to golden brown in just hours. The color is not only amazing, but the best I've received yet. Thank you for the outstanding experience that was comfortable and worry free. You guys are a prize and would definitely recommend them to anyone!<//Review>

Went to Teresa @ the Mona Lisa Hair Salon on third when I was in SF, my last hair style was not a style at all! the cut/color was bad ;( I had a wedding to attend plus the New Years coming up, I needed help, LOL! she did a color correction and found a style that fits me and easy to manage, being a mom I use to rock the bun and pony tails, now I have this BANGING BANGS with this sunkist ombre', I've never had so much compliments with my hair style before...thank you Teresa!!! Also all the staff at the FIG on third was very accommodating, very relaxed atmosphere also professional, I highly recommend this Salon and Teresa!!!
Keep up the great work, can't wait to come back!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Spoke with Aaron over the phone and he provided a quote for pads and rotors. The actual bill was under the quote. Was also able to get me in the next day. Absolutely amazing customer service by Albert when I arrived. All said and done, I will have no hesitation taking my other vehicles here for any type of service. THANK YOU!<//review>< pictures>

<review>One star is the best number I can give for this store. if there is option of Zero(0) rate, I would have definitely choose that. They provide really awful customer service and bad behavior from staffs. Mechanics were very rude and manger was not helpful.  They will charge you twice for same service and didn't do the work properly. I would never go back to this store.</review><Gmap_id>0x808e32bcee63b55f:0x814dadb779f85851< /Gmap_id><rate>1< /rate><Response>{'time': 1606267496233, 'text': "Hello, Pravin.

<rate>1< /rate><text>this place is scam. two months ago i did my change oil and after that they told me to do Brakes which estimated 1000$+ because they told me it is brakes plus extra stuff in the brake. however, today i went to another branch of firestone and i did change oil + brake inspection and the result was that my brake is fine and there is no need to change it.   so My question

Went in for a tire rotation and a patch for a flat since i bought  the tires there. The only thing done was the tire rotation. The nail was still in the tire. Then they mentioned my AC condenser was bad, funny thing is i didn’t tell them to check anything. Just a tire rotation and flat fix. I had my ac nice and cold before i got there. Guess what!!!!!! My ac stopped working a day later .  Please do not go to this place, be forewarned , funny thing is my brother also had his two vehicles damaged at this location.</Review>< rate>

If I could give a negative review I would. Horrible customer service. I understand we are in a pandemic and businesses have been losing money but to add extra services that are not needed to vehicles and damaging vehicles in order to make up for the lost time is not acceptable. Went in for oil change and came out with a quote for 3k worth of services. I kindly denied and all of a sudden all the items they said needed service started giving me problems . (Ac gave out, car would start with no issues now I have to try to start it twice, now I have a puddle of coolant every night in my driveway) no integrity with this shop.< /Review>

<Review>Prompt and professional service.

Only reason for removing 1-star is due to the shop failing to clean off all the white heavy lubricant left all over each of the four wheels (used to assist sliding the rubber tire onto the steel rim). Took nearly 10-minutes of scrubbing per wheel to clean off the debris! Bummer

Otherwise, great business that exceed my expectations.</Review>< Pics>

Some of the worst customer service I have ever witnessed. Will never go to this place again. If you would like to be scammed, charged exorbitant fees and treated like worthless dirt throughout the whole customer experience, I would HIGHLY recommend this place to you.<//text>

I have been going to different Firestones locations for so many years. This location is the worst. I am truly disappointed with this location’s customer service. They could care less about me. They are a disgrace in term of customer care.The manager is not professional enough to treat customer.
I needed the immersion change, as I brought my car in the store 1 day. They could not fix it, and I understand they have to wait on the part. They told me the part will arrive one week.
That's week I were on vacation. I could not come, but I paid them everything.
After I got back from my vacation, I tried to call the store, and they said they are not available on the weekend.
Weekend is the only day I am available, then I kept call in the store I could not make my appointment.
Finally, I stopped by store to make appointment. They told me to come at 9:00am on Sunday.
Finally, again, I came at 9:00am on Sunday, Albert Tsai was really mean to me, he not even apologized for anything. He said can you come back next Sunday. I felt like they treated the customer like a child. They don’t value my time at all.
I am not recommending any one of you to come to this store. I have been with FireStone Store all over U.S, this is my first time ever to have that feeling about customer service like this.</Text>

Wish I could give them lower than 1 star. They did a tire rotation on my vehicle previously. The car had a flat tire a few months later and I needed to put the spare on. They gunned the lug nut on so hard that it snapped when I tried to take it off. After I spoke to the manager over the phone, he basically said it wasn't their fault and called me a racial slur. Won't be coming back here since all the people they can hire are literally monkeys.<//review>

Thanks Brad for everything. We’ve been to this location twice now and have had great customer service. Our rotors and brakes work awesome. We will definitely come back to your store if we are in the area again.
Keep up the great work!!<//Review>

<text>I called in the morning to make appointment for alignment for 1:30 pm. Got one, but the person didn't ask for my name.  So, I called back to give him my name. He said "No. Just show up at 1:30."  He said it would take 90mins.

When I showed up at the store,  manager says there is no appointment in his system.  So, I told him about my earlier conversation. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he would have the car ready by 5pm. I asked him about 90 min wait.  He curtly said he would have it done by 5pm.

I told him that had traveled 16 miles for this appointment.  No reaction.  He again curtly asked me if I wanted to drop or not.  I couldn't wait four hours.  I didn't know he was the manager.  So, asked him if I could talk to the manager.

Throughout the conversation,  let alone a simple apology,  he was extremely rude and arrogant.  Don't ever go to this place.

I am also reporting this to the national Firestone HQ.< /text><user_id>111800441285723088493< /user_id><Resp>{'time': 1580343341966, 'text': "Hello Sharad, we'd be happy to address any service issues that you may have encountered and we apologize for any frustration caused by this experience.

I brought my honda pilot towed there with faulty charging system, after getting billed for the charging system check, they told me it was just a dead battery. I picked up my car and drove to Sacramento where I live...30 mins later the same faulty charging system came up and I have to be towed for the  second time. What a waste of time and money, I would have given them 0 stars if I can...they never checked the charging systems system.. after getting  billed for it...they left the car with grease marks and dirty too...</review>

<text>Once again with attitude. Came in 2 times in 1 week and got attitude by same person. I have life time alignment, both time i came in the guy said i have to leave my car there around 5 to 6 hrs (i will not get my car back till the shop almost close). Is that mean because i have the life time alignment, i dont have to pay a penny after the service so i get SERVICE LAST with ATTITUDE.

I gave it to Albert (A manager), and got it back two days later with several things still wrong with it. There was a oil leak, several belts needed replacing and I could still smell coolant burning on the engine. When asked about these things, Albert replied, "Hey, I have a laundry list of things that need to be fixed in your car, but you're not our only customer. I fixed it so that you could drive out of here. Now, make a new appointment and come back when you want to fix the rest of the items." Long story short, not only did that visit set me back $1,800.00, but my "Engine Warning" light was on again by the end of the week.
I made another appointment two weeks later and got our friend Albert again. Long story short: The vehicle was put on a rack and raised up in such a way as to crack the driver's side front bumper. The car was in their shop for two days, and Albert told me that he was not responsible to fix whatever had made the "Engine Warning" light come back on. He had fixed everything that he had claimed to, perfectly. A new problem had made the light come back on.
Then, came the fun part. As I went to take my keys back from Albert to try and find a real mechanic, Albert held the keys up over his head and told me that he had read the "anonymous" How-Did-We-Do Survey that I had filled out after my last visit. He told me, "I'm sure that a survey like that doesn't mean anything to you, but this is my job that you're f***ing with." Yes... he used THAT word. He refused to give me my keys back until I told him that I would fill out a new survey that would make everything right.
Two weeks later, I took my car to Meineke and the manager (A very friendly and upfront lady) told me that almost none of the work that had been listed as being done from my Firestone receipt appears as though it was done. A filter and some oil had been replaced and a temporary fix-it caulk had been poured into my cooling system. She fixed everything else for under $1,000.00 and my "Engine Warning" light immediately went out.
Suffice to say, once I pay off my Firestone bill, I will never be returning to the franchise branch on Tully Rd. or to Albert's greasy, opportunistic snake pit again.</text>< Name>

This is where my family and I usually buy tires, but after today I’m definitely not coming back. I got a flat tire  so I called to see if they could fix it for me. The guy that answered the phone told me that I had to leave the tire there and that they will call me when is ready. He say around 5 to 6 and I called at 1.

I went to America’s Tires and they fix my tire in 30 minutes.<//text>

<Name>Andrew Betancourt< /Name><review>I made an appt for 4pm, got an email confirmation. I work at a hospital, left work early to make the appt and was told it was too late for a service and that is unreasonable for me to expect a service to be done in an hr. I asked why the appt  was approved. Not to mention I called the store twice to cancel, and no answer. They told me if my breaks are squeaking, obviously I need breaks. I’m no mechanic and figured an inspection would be best. Terrible customer service. People expect experts to be trustworthy and kind. This company has a strong reputation so I was hopeful, but I will not be going there again. Kind customer service is all I ask. I left worked early and rushed only to feel like an idiot.< /review><time>1583196100210< /time>< response>

Scheduled an appointment for 12 and was told the oil change would take about 90 minutes. When we got to the store we were told it would be a 3 and a half hour wait. We had an appointment at 3 which wouldn’t work. They said they’d make it work. We had two other people walk in after us. Get serviced and leave before they even took our car back. A 90 minute wait turned into 2 hours and 45 minutes. What’s the point of scheduling for an if they aren’t going to follow it?<//Review>

I bought an alighment and balancing package for the life of the car while the car is under my name and they now say that they don’t find the car in the computer this is ridiculous because if  I  allreary payed I want that service to be done, I think that they do that after a couple of years after you buy the life time balancing package which is not fair.< /Text>

My car needed alignment. I called in the morning and was told that they'd be able to help me if I bring the car in. I arrived at 10:30 am and was helped right away. Told that the service would be done within 2 hour window. They actually finished the job within 1 hour and I was on my way again at 11:30am.<//Text>

I took in my 2000 Honda Ody in for an oil change today on Xmas eve. I believe Arnold did the work. I'm not sure though. Either way I liked that he or someone fixed my right turning signal :) Thank you so much! Awesome customer service. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the wait.<//Text>

TL;DR: They're slow af and the manager will try to rip you off if you look like you don't know cars. AKA me, a young asian chick. Go somewhere else or have someone who knows cars go with you.

Back in May this year, I went in to get a flat tire checked and replaced if necessary. I got in at 11am and they said they'll "definitely be done by the time they close."
So I come back at 5:30 because they close at 6. It wasn't done yet, so I didn't mind waiting a while. At 5:55, I see my tire hasn't moved at all. I ask about it, and THEN they start working on it. The technician is attentive and patient, but the manager says to him, "This is on you. I'm leaving exactly at 6, I have a wife to get to and a dinner to eat," which is a terrible way to treat your staff.
The technician brushes it off as a joke and continues to explain the status of my tire to me, saying my tread is at 3/16 so I can get a new tire for cheaper, even if they don't have the old model and will give me a new one. As he gets to the price part around 6:05, the manager is still around and beelines over. Whispers something about 3/32 and changing the price, all while I'm standing there. He says it'll cost over $100 on the spot. I'm a college student and don't know a lot about cars but I know he's trying to rip me off. I tell him that I can't afford that, but I will refer him to my dad who can handle the situation.
He says, "I'll take two of your doors for the tire," and laughs. Absolutely disgusting. They call my dad and they put the price on his Firestone credit card and says he'll double check it later.
Later that week, back in SF, my dad takes the car to our local Firestone and confirms that they ripped us off. The SF Firestone gives us in store credit.
All in all, my tire probably didn't even need to be replaced. The stupid manager probably just didn't want to fix it for free from our warranty bought in SF rather than SJ. Fire the terrible manager and promote the nice technician.<//text>

Drove 20 minutes because I was told my hard-to-find tire was in stock. It wasn't. On top of an expensive delivery fee, it wouldn't be there for another three days. I live three hours away and needed it the same day. Not cool guys.< /Text>

Had an appointment at 11pm, didn't get checked after 3pm, and didn't get my car finished 'till the following day. What wrong with it? a bubble on the side of the right rear tire. Tried to explained exactly what's wrong but  these people were not listening, very bad shop to have your vehicle worked on. Stay away.</Review>

Very frustrating when the manager Brad tells you there's availability to service your vehicle and it should take approximately 90 minutes, takes your phone number and tells you to come in. You show up 20 minutes later to be told it's going to take at least 3.5 hours and you really should leave the vehicle over night! Get your story straight before you have people come in.
I'll be servicing our vehicles at another location in the future.

<Date>1615924255782</Date><review>I donate here a lot, but the last few times I've been there the guy receiving has been really rude. I tried to give him the benefit of doubt and assumed he was having a hard time but when I went to donate today he was rude as usual but also aggressive. Made me really uncomfortable. When I asked for his name so I could make a complaint he refused and got threatening. I get that times are tough and people are on edge but whoever does the staffing here should consider that some people are better cut out for working behind the scenes and not interacting with people. I won't be shopping or donating here again.< /review><pics>None< /pics><user_name>David Haskins<//user_name>< resp>

Great place to drop off donations quickly! You just drive up and empty your donations into bins. Staff is friendly and you can get a coupon when you donate for your next purchase. I found a pretty dress and comfy sweater for a reasonable price.< /Text>

Awful. When trying to drop off my donation on the street where cars are driving by a young man, of course appropriately masked for covid explained the procedure to me. It was impossible to unnderstand what he was saying because of his mask and the traffic. I asked him to repeat it and another car drove by. I didnt hear him. He gets agressively and says, "Obviously you are not listening to me when I am explaining this to you." I was actually afraid, and did my best get it over and leave. So for dontating to the Good Will expect to get intimidated and harassed.< /review>

The store is consistently clean; they keep track of people coming and going, so a Covid appropriate number of people are shopping at once.  There are arrows in the aisles directing people traffic. Everyone is masked up.

Safety aside, the staff here are friendly and helpful, as are the donation receivers on the side of the building on Borchard.

Good place for thrifting.< /Text>

This is one of the better GW stores imo. The donation receiving area is around the side of building rather than behind, making it easier to drop off donations.  Parking is not a problem as it's in a plaza sharing ample space with nearby businesses. Staff are always friendly and available for helping customers. For instance, an older woman had fallen on her way out and she was instantly helped to her feet by a quick witted staff member. And on a personal note, this store doesn't seem to smell as musty as many other thrift stores, if that's not your thing.< /Text>

I love goodwill.  This store is clean they have a good selection. If your looking for good deals on clothes or shoes this is your place.   If your looking for that hidden gem, the donation that will make you some money on ebay...well then this is not your store, the hidden treasures are not here, I assume they are sorted in the back and go somewhere else..<//Review>

Excellent place to find rare Liquors and wines. And above-average selection of craft beers. One of the best and widest selection of single-malt scotches I've seen in quite a while. Very knowledgeable staff. Store is clean and friendly.</Text>

I love the customer service and prices, it’s quick, convenient and clean! I’ve never had trouble finding what I needed. I just wish they would carry coke products and a bigger containers of pineapple  juice for rum! ;)< /Review>

So excited they decided to open up this location . Great for everything you need . If they do not have what your looking for , they will be more than happy to order it. Also great place to find Craft beer. And I was told they will be stocking Hard liquor very soon.<//text>

A Happy discovery, great selection...
I am a fan of Sarcasm but, was a bit put off by the extent of the sarcasm and lack of welcome at the purchase end. I would have given 5 stars had the person been less insecure and more open and friendly. I might try again in the future to see if any changes to this have been made. Other then that.. it’s about distance and convenience at best. Sadly</Review>

Absurd prices for mom-n-pop establishments. Rather go to bevmo or costco. VERY limited selection, customer service subpar. Never any parking.<//text>

{'time': 1541172459596, 'text': "Thank you for your opinion you are more than welcome to go to Costco or bevmo. For Costco you need to pay $100 just to get for the first time and then you can buy just one beer. Also at bevmo you can't mix and match. Yes we can't match prices for those big companies because when you go to Costco you never walk out spending less than $100. But we do appreciate your opinion. Thank you also you work for a LIQUOR store owner you should not be leaving reviews about a store where you have  never step a foot in."}</response>

Not huge on a Craft or Specialty brew everyday but they can do no wrong by me with 18 packs of Bud one cooler over..Super points added for not smelling Nag-Champa upon entering!😁</Text>

OVER PRICED craft beers. Hardly any domestic regular beers, or imports. Very small selection, rather go to Wal-Mart than this dump.<//review>

Cynthia at Veronica’s insurance in LongBeach on Anaheim was awesome!, she assisted me with getting the best insurance plan for my needs at an affordable price and was well educated on her products and explained everything so I could understand it, also the team was very friendly and welcoming. Thanks so much for all your help! 😊

I was able to get a great deal at Veronicas’ insurance thanks to the broker that assisted me. Juan, the broker, was very attentive, and professional. He answered all my questions and made me feel very comfortable. I was paying so much more with my previous insurance, but juan was able to help me save money. Thank you juan!</text>

Unfortunately, the shop is deteriorating in its customer service at the least.
Came by today at 8:45am for a quick oil change, brought my oil and filter to avoid filter not being in stock.
Checked in with James (the guy who runs the shop) and was told there is a car in front of me and it will take about an hour before they can get me in.  Not a problem, I thought and sat patiently in my car right in front of James waiting, he clearly saw me waiting. 10:15am hits the clock and I open the door to ask James if he has an update. To which I am told "oh, we not going to do it, we don't have a plug"  ...... 1. Plug is not required being replaced and I have a washer replace the included in the oil change kit I brought. 2. You see me waiting for over an hour and not bother let me know about this?

Waste of time.

Can no longer recommend this spot and won't be coming back either.< /Text>< pictures>

As you did not have an appointment and were a drop in and based on our conversation about not having the drain plug, I did not know you were waiting. You still wanting us to do the oil change was not made clear to me. I also did not clearly see you in your vehicle. I even asked fellow coworkers about your vehicle. As you stated you arrived at 9:45am and came out of your car at 10:15am so I'm pretty certain you were not waiting for over an hour. At our shop we always replace the drain plug when servicing european vehicles due to oil leaks. If a customer insists on still wanting for us to install the parts we can but can not warranty against leaks."}</Resp>

Super honest group of guys that always look out for the customer. Called yesterday and was able to get an appt for this morning regarding an oil change and tire rotation. Vehicle was done in a little over an hr! Crazy fast and efficient! Also, James has always given me tips on keeping my vehicle intact. Very knowledgable guy. Thank you so much for taking care of my vehicle! You guys are awesome!< /text>

This place is awesome. Not only did Matt find the "super rare" tires I needed, and mount them, he rotated them also, and warned me about my lug nuts having a problem. He was super polite, fast , and has very fantastic customer service skills. This place is cheap on the pocket book but high quality service. Highly recommended.<//review>

<text>The price is excellent and I called around they're  the cheapest around. I'm glad I googled shops and called around for prices. Matt was the guy I spoke to he was very polite and very informative.   my tires were bald and had multiple nails in it. I got to the  shop early and they had my tires ready asap. they also do tire rotation and oil changes ect call them for all your car needs!!<//text>< pics>

Needed a emergency tire replacement and was recommended by a friend who had used them before.  They special ordered my tires and  got them in the same evening and had them installed past their closing time so that I would not have to come back in the next day. Very thoughtful!!
Great service experience to recommend.< /text>

Excellent customer service!!! We were in the area from Southern CA when we noticed that we needed a new tire to make it back home. There was a misunderstanding in regards to the price and shortly before work started on the car,  the owner left. The guy working on the car took care of us to turn the experience around and ensure we left happy and with safe tires.</text>

I recommend this place if you looking for quality and comfortable bill at the end.

<review>Excellent Service!  Bernie was fantastic explaining the difference in tread of different brand tires.  I have Lexus RX450h and it’s goes through tires in less than 20k miles!  He recommended tires that would last longer & have a 50k warranty!  I agreed and he had the tires in the next day!  Just in time.. I blew out a tire and had to have AAA tow my car to the shop!

I originally called Bay Tires for used tire but, after Burnie explained the tread issues and I decided to buy new tires instead! Not at all pushy or trying to make a sale...  just very knowledgeable! Burnie gave me an excellent price on new tires!

Also I forgot to tell them my Crome Wheels are peeling and tires continue to lose air, they had just finished my tires and they put the black goo on the inside of the rims to fix the leaking issue.  Its nice to know that addressed the issue without me pointing it out!  They told me I still may need to re Crome the wheel but, it might seal tires!

All around experience was positive!  Highly recommend!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The team at Bay Tires do tires right.  They have a large selection for most 14, 15, 16 and 17 inch wheels; great prices and super service.  Used or new I highly recommend Bay Tires without reservation.</review>

This shop just moved to a new location across the street and now offers a Mounting Service! They filled the last missing piece of a full service tire shop that still offers great prices, quality service, and lifetime warranty on repairs.  I just picked up a spare for my Audi A4 and when they said it had 70% thread on the phone, it actually had it when i arrived there, unlike another local tire ship whose tire lost 30% of thread in 1h time that it took me to get there.</Text>

<text>Shopped online with them...everything went great. Very fast shipping. Great prices. Very fast responses to my emails as well. I worked with someone named "Vitali" at the shop. I had no prior knowledge of this place, just saw they had the exact tire brand/size I was looking for under a google search...so I took my chances. Glad it worked out!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Purchased the tires online and showed up to have them installed.  They didn't have a lift but they jacked up my car and installed the tires quickly.  Everyone was helpful and I was in and out in a half hour.  Overall nice guys; I would reccomend them to anyone looking for replacement tires.<//Text>

I have looked everywhere and they have the best prices. Vitaly is a pleasure to deal with, he is extremely flexible with his schedule, and went out of his way to accommodate my schedule. They have tons of choices, and it's unlikely you won't find what you're looking for. I highly recommend them!<//review>

I'm in GA and needed a rush item printed for my supervisor who had received a damaged foamboard sign by mail and needed to present later that day. The team was super helpful and Jeri was able to get it done quick and looking perfect! I appreciate them all!</Review>

<Review>Super un-helpful customer service...  I noticed that several of the reviews note that the employees seem to be bothered that there were customers asking for help... that was my experience as well.  I came in yesterday to laminate copies our Covid-19 vaccination cards for travel and couldn't find the "lamination station" that most FedEx/Kinko's have in store.

After searching the store, I went up to the not busy customer counter to ask about it... 3 employees were milling about, working on something, but nothing that seemed like assembling bibles for the Vatican... one well dress young lady eventually wandered over my way while continuing to chat with the other employees.  It was long enough that I almost asked the "group" if this was the correct line to stand in to get help.

I didn't get her name, I wish that I had so that I could be more specific with my feedback.  When I asked about the lamination station, she pointed vaguely to the back of the store and said "It's over there where it always is..."  She then went to get a couple full sized lamination sheets... I said I'm just doing a couple small items and where are the sheets that most FedEx's have at the station.  She said they don't do that here...

Anyway... the interaction was very unhelpful and not very courteous.  No, I wasn't buying $500 worth of printing... But I HAVE!!

Note to Management:  This location obviously needs some customer support training judging from the comments.< /Review></record>

Year after year FedEX stores are poorly run. Disorganized customer lines, understaffed, resulting customer tension and an overall negative experience. One more thing that needs to be de-brick and mortared.

Change: Editing from two stars to one after they want to scan your ID to ship a packet of papers.

Bye FedEx!< /review>

<text>Customer service is horrible. I was told by an employee that I could have my large items picked up, boxed, sent via ground by FedEx to another state. I call right now to set up a pick up time and I am told that they do not box items and that I have to figure out my size boxes and have it ready. THIS IS A SHIPPING COMPANY! now, I have less than a day to figure this out because I leave by car Friday morning.

<review>Poor experience here. Went in last Monday to get a newspaper laminated. Came back and the assistant manager messed it up. Human nature says I am to be upset which I was. I let him know my displeasure and he put it back on me and started snapping at me. Memo to manager, I realize these young kids don't understand how to communicate, but give him lessons on how to handle situations. You don't put this on customers...</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80db7e3e2770128f:0xaaca31712b13caa7</gmap_id></record>

Spirals allow the book to lay flat on the music rack and helps facilitate page turning. This is a very important feature to a working musician. Norma, the sales associate, was able to do the job while I waited. Took only about 15 minutes and I was out the door. I have used FedEx for years and am always satisfied. Thanks, Norma.<//Review>< pics>

I haven't used FedEx printing services for a while, and actually it was called kinkos the last I used them, but all I had to do was walk in and they would print off 1 page for me and out the door I would go. This man hands me a card and says email your page to this email, it'll take 5 mins to get a confirmation, then the lady out here can help you print it off. I will go elsewhere and spend my money where they actually want my services.< /Review><user>105796557032987214047<//user><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><time>1579207557408<//time><rating>1< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Package was a day late, zero help on customer service, extremely disappointed in FEDEX!
Not the company they use to be.
Got the run around with 800-GoFEDEX, called the shipping FEDEX location ... zero help as well.  No one wants to help but it’s all FEDEX offices.  Just know if you have an issues NO ONE AT FEDEX WILL HELP YOU!
Save you time!
Save your money!
DO NOT SHIP WITH FEDEX!</text><date>1570594775358<//date>< user>

One star is too much. I shipped a package priority overnight  and specifically and clearly told the clerk NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED.  After the business transaction was completed I noticed the receipt indicated DIRECT SIGNATURE REQUIRED.  I called this location and they told me I had to call customer support to have it changed.  I called customer support and they told me that because I don't have an account number I have to go back to the local FedEx and have them call customer support to have it changed.  I drove all the way back only to have the local office call customer support to find out that they can't change it either and there is nothing that can be done.  I was told that essentially it was all my fault because I declared the value too high to go no sig required.  Would have been great to know that upfront - I would have declared the value at $4.00.  The recipient of this package is disabled and can not possible make it to the door in a timely manner to sign for this package.  I WILL NEVER, EVER USE FEDEX AGAIN.< /text>

<review>Make sure you check everything - multiple mistakes, several times now. I’m always catching sometime wrong with the printing. This last time I paid for 15 packets to be made and I only received 8!

If my company didn’t have an account here I would never use them, horrible work.<//review>< Time>

<Text>Avoid this one, at least the print center. I uploaded a two page document to the web site but it kept formatting at three pages. I use Fedex Office regularly and as it says on the website, they check the documents before printing.

Not this store. The tired, bored woman who gave me my order said, "We just send it to the printer, not our problem" and I left with every third page being blank and being charged for it.

Awful service and no attention to detail. Next time I'll go to Staples or somewhere else. You should as well.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Terrible customer service! Instead of offering to rebox my package for shipping they told me to go to a different Fedex maybe they can help me. I never had a problem with this store until today. I ship a lot of company items through this branch because of great customer service until today. Terrible customer service from someone.< /review>

<text>Horrible Horrible customer service starting from VICTOR to every else. All the good ones during the years that i have seen wont stay on this location for long. Today, I had to fax a paper and both their fax machines were out of order so i waited in line for 40 min to get a paper faxed. They had more people in the back but refuse to call someone to help me during this 40 minutes. Finally someone came and took my paper to the back and he totally forgot about me and start helping other people who already was getting help. I heard my fax confirmation, so did everyone else but he did not come back to me. So after 15 min he finally remembers me because all the other customers are gone and he had the nerve to charge me 2 dollars for my fax. If i did not have a dead line to fax my documents i would not waiste my time at this location! Go as far as you can from this location. They dont deserve your business!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80db7e3e2770128f:0xaaca31712b13caa7< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great drop off for pre-paid packages.  Walk in, walk out, easy access and because it's 24 hour you can drop of packages really early or even use their services early.<//review>

<review>This store was unwilling to help with a simple sizing of a photo. If they are that lazy with a small job can't imagine if I had a large project. Aaron was the sales person I spoke with on the store. Bad service< /review>< pictures>

I purchased a Ford F150 from Bill Brandt Ford and was extremely pleased with the overall experience.  Alejandro was very helpful in the entire process, and I managed to save over $9000 dollars compared to the prices that were quoted to me in Sunnyvale for trucks that were two years older than the 2020 that I purchased.  The experience was well worth the drive.</review>

Instantly you can feel the hospitality and warmth upon arrival. I felt very comfortable and relaxed by the entire staff/workers. I knew I was in good hands and I was so amazed on how professional the dealership was. Luis was such a great help and didn't hesitate to make me feel at home and welcomed. I definitely RECOMMEND this place to anyone looking for a good quality vehicle. YOU WONT REGRET IT.<//Review>

<Review>My wife and I have purchased two vehicles here in 2020. The staff here are very friendly and accommodating. They aren’t pushy or abrasive. I worked with Franklin and he knows his stuff. He is honest and didn’t put any pressure on me. I would highly recommend this dealership for purchasing your next Ford. We are very pleased.  The service department is great as well, very friendly and communicate well.< /Review><gmapID>0x808ffeea09ad5045:0x3506cbcb5138aaff<//gmapID><rate>5< /rate>< userid>

Make sure everything is how you want it before you leave promises where not kept so I have to buy new floor mats and a new key I highly recommend going somewhere else. Fremont Ford springs to mind may be a little more money but everything will be right when you get your vehicle. Love my truck hate the company.<//Review>

Awesome service. Greg was fantastic. Other dealerships were trying to price gouge the Bronco Sport by $10k over MSRP but not this dealership. I highly recommend it.<//text>

It seems that they have good prices, but wait until you find out missing parts in the car you want.

If you want to buy a car go somewhere else. This store has the worst sales team I have ever seen in my life. Customer service is a missing word in their dictionary.

Don't trust them, they will do anything to sell you products and services you don't need. And if you ask them to remove it they will laugh at you back.

<text>I called on a Thursday to see if I could get tires.  OMGosh, I brought my car in that same day, and by Friday AM, my car was ready to go.
Leticia at the service desk was wonderful on the phone, very helpful.  And she didn't stop there, she explained everything to me, and when I picked up my car, she was there to explain the invoice.  Absolutely delighted with their service.</text>< Pics>

<review>This dealership is somewhat informative, although they went out of their way to make sure we got the car... I noticed a crack in my windshield before purchasing the car, we asked to have a price reduction OR have it fixed. They said they would “Fill in the crack on the windshield.” Well! Upon delivery of my vehicle today, there’s now ANOTHER CRACK in my windshield with the 1st crack still there. Looks like they tried to have it filled in, but messed up and cracked the windshield some more. Not too impressed with whomever tried to handle the job, otherwise Evan was a great person to work with. Johnny and I appreciate you Evan!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Experience:
With the pandemic in full effect, I spent a year doing virtual window shopping for cars since I had the luxury of working from home.
I initially found my 2019 Ford fusion online. I reached out to see if I could get a test drive and got connected with their internet sales consultant, David Padilla. That morning was pretty smooth. I showed up and the car was right by the driveway ready to go for the test drive -- definitely schedule an appointment a few days ahead of time.

The test drive was solo. I took my time feeling the car out. I am 6'1 and have a football player build. With that being said, It was very easy to slip in and out of the car. When I got back, the process was like an assembly line, very smooth and no real hold-ups. When everything was ready to go,  David offered to deliver my car to my home since I came to the dealership solo. He was super helpful and attentive. Total process took about 3 hours from I arrived to when I got home with the new car.

Financing:
Based off of my credit Report and what my options were, I told them I did not want to pay over a certain amount with the added features and services. They were more than accommodating and I did not feel any remorse over my purchase.

Overall:
It has been about a month and I am very happy with my car. I remember telling Mr. Padilla, " I'm aiming for the path of least resistance" meaning I didn't want to overcomplicate things. Not sure if that meant much, but my experience was very smooth. If I was ever in the need for a pick up or an  SUV, I'd definitely come back.

Pros :
No pandering.
Process was smooth.
Home Delivery was super helpful.

Cons:
Physical location - dealership is on both sides of the main road  in town. Even though my car was "Used" car, it was in the "New" car side of the dealership. Not a big deal except the road was a 4 lane Boulevard  and the crossing intersections were not close by.

I'd still recommend these awesome people 5 stars!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Traded in my car and Bill Brandt Ford made the process easy. Luis helped me out during my initial visit when I stopped by to browse the car I had in mind to trade in for. Evan helped me out as well with some of the negotiation. When I called Luis to let him know I was ready to make a deal he came in on his day off to take care of it. That says a lot about him and the people that work here. The car was competitively priced compared to other cars in the market with similar miles/years. Highly recommend them to anyone.</Review>

I also was told the car I bought had two keys but I only got one of the keys and after 2 months of asking them about it they ignored. I also have text message proof that they said they had my key and that they were going to send it and after a month of them not sending it I then talk to someone in their front office i think his name is Rick and they said they would go half and half with me to get a second key made and he had me send my address for nothing because I never got a check. This company is not the best and I don't recommend buying a car here because its clear they don't care. I have had to fix my tires on this car when it was almost brand new a engine light has gone on all bad. Company is all bad. I'll give them a 2 star since the car is running.< /review>< date>

< Review>
2014 Raptor blown motor. After 4 long awaited months Bill Brandt has successfully transplanted a new motor into this beast!

They had dealt with faulty engines coming from the Ford plant and kept pushing through, one after the next. The headaches were frustrating but they managed to make it happen! I'm so happy with the communication and service from the team here! I will definitely be returning in the future for any/all Ford related needs; whether it be purchasing a new vehicle to getting mine repaired. Thank you all for a job well done!!<//Review>

Had a great experience with Bill Brandt Ford.  After getting the runaround from several other dealerships, from different manufacturers, we had a quick, efficient and satisfactory deal at Bill Brandt.  There was no back and forth or underhanded tactics.  They honored the value of our trade-in and we were in and out quickly.<//Review>

<Text>My experience was with Marc.  I was relieved with his ability to streamline the purchase process, know what the customers needs are, and find a way to act quickly - without playing games.

Throughout this process, I never felt pushed, taken advantage of, confused, or irritated, like I normally would with your typical sales person at a dealership.  Highly recommend Marc for your Ford needs.

Last note:  The rest of the team was very helpful during Marc's absence.  Also something I find rare at dealerships.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>So, I purchased a certified used truck, drove from 30 miles away to see it, and test drive it. It was completely torn apart and the salesman couldn’t find it. Came back, few days later, bought the truck, purchased the warranty that I was told was good at any Ford dealership, boy I got taken to the cleaners on that one. It’s a F-150 platinum so the extra few thousand bucks seemed like a smart purchase to be able to take it to any dealer. Had a light come on, take it to the dealer nearest me, they tell me no such warranty is on it. I call, I call and nothing. I highly suggest stay away from here.<//text>< Pictures>

I was helped by Marc and Kyle for the sale and finance of my new F150. I had already done most of my research on the particular truck I wanted, an F150 STX and Marc helped me with sourcing exactly what I wanted and getting the truck transported. He walked me through the features and helped expedite the process of paperwork by preparing it prior to my arrival to finish the sale. Kyle took care of me on the financial end of the sale and helped release me from a prior car loan with a trade in of the vehicle. He was transparent on all legal literature I was signing and was knowledgeable on the questions that I asked. I had an excellent car buying experience and cannot recommend this dealership and these gentlemen enough.< /text>

<Review>I had a fantastic experience at Bill Brandt Ford with purchasing a new 2021 Ford F150. My salesman, Greg Renwick, was very knowledgeable and helpful thoughout the process. Greg's professionalism shows his great knowledge of Ford trucks. He made my purchase experience very pleasant. I definitely will be recommending Greg Renwick and Bill Brandt Ford to all my friends and family.< /Review>< user_name>

My car was towed to the dealership. $788 later, I picked up my car with owners manuel on seat, with inserts scattered  across  it.  While the parts manager  Rudy did a good job, twice I asked the staff to speak to the fixed operations  director, to no avail.
Over priced, poor service by not being able to speak to manager.   No further service from me</Review>

<Text>Great experience.  Our car blew an engine and my husband is handicapped so buying experience was important .  Bill Brandt and sales agent Franklin Martin was exceptional.  Franklin took the time to bring out several different cars so my husband could test if he could get in and out comfortably.  All of my questions were answered with knowledge of the ford products. There was no pressure selling by anyone, just respect and helpfulness.  Cannot
praise this dealership enough.  Great atmosphere and service.  Thank you<//Text>< date>

I was in the market for a commuter car and found a Fusion SE Hybrid for a great price. Nate answered all my questions over the phone. When I came to see the car, he was there to greet me, but I never felt pressured to make a decision. As the car was getting prepped for sale, Nate gave me updates on the status.

When I came back for a second look, the car was ready to go. I took it out for a spin and was ready to purchase. Out the door pricing was fair and (mostly) honest. They added some VIN etching to the body parts without the option to decline or remove it. Overall, could have been worse.

Kenny from finance made the paperwork and transaction process painless and easy to understand.

Got the car I needed with a fantastic warranty (10yr /125K) baked in. Thank you for the friendly and straight forward experience.< /review>

<GmapID>0x808ffeea09ad5045:0x3506cbcb5138aaff</GmapID><name>GE S<//name><review>I scheduled an appointment with Bill Brandt Ford to have my clutch assembly repaired and replaced in my 1999 Ford F350 Supercab, as well as repairing the rear door latch. When making the appointment I was told that it would take one day to0 complete the repairs, which led me to believe that the replacement parts were in stock. I delivered the truck to the dealership at 8:55am. After completing the work order, I was told that they would call me in the late afternoon, presumably to inform me the truck was ready to reclaim. I was called at 4:30pm only to be informed that the rear door needed a complete latch replacement. The clutch had not been started at this time, and no parts had been ordered. The work was not completed until the following Wednesday late afternoon. Upon  reclaiming the truck the following morning, the truck was delivered to me covered in dust, grease smeared over the driver side floor mat, and grease smeared around the boot of the stick shift. The batteries were so low on charge that I had to get a jump start to get the engine started. After leaving the parking lot for home, the engine noise was so load that it sounded like it was in the cab. Apparently the sound attenuation padding was not replaced. Upon inspection when I got home, there was a new scratch down to the primer on the drivers side back door, more grease on the headliner at the back door latch, and wind noise at the right rear door due to a loose (replaced) door latch. This truck was in immaculate condition when I took it in, and destroyed when I picked it up.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

If you like to be disrespected by sales staff, this is the dealership for you...

I bought a use car from them, which they offered to deliver to my house after they had completed a service on them. Their driver delivered the car, tossed me the key and left before I could inspect. When I started the car a warning light came up warning be about a low tire pressure. I checked the pressure and all the tires were at the wrong pressure. Had to add back air to all of them. Some days later, light came back on. One of the tire was leaking air. Contacted the dealership again which sent me in this multi-day chase to get someone to help me with this.

Eventually talked to Frank, my salesperson, who texted me "no one here can believe that you expect such a thing over a tire with a slow leak... wow".

Very unhelpful, unprofessional. Don't bother buying from them.</text>

Not happy with the customer service. Very inconsiderate. They cared more about the diagnostic fee then finding out what was wrong with the vehicle. My car wouldn't start on several occasions. Doing my own research I narrowed it down to 2 potential causes, and one was the starter. Within a couple days of getting the car back from Bill Brandt, with no resolution, the car again wouldn't start. So I had to have it towed back to Bill Brandt and wouldn't you know it was the starter needing replaced</text>

<Review>Well what I liked most about the dealership is I was greeted right away. Also, when I test drove the car the sales rep trusted me to do a test drive without him. They gave me a great warranty! My rep showed me how to use the electronics in my car. Its was a simply beautiful experience for me. The staff was so fun we laughed and cracked jokes. I would recommend Bill Brandt Ford to everyone. Also, it's family owned. If your shopping for a car it's worth the drive to shot at Bill Brandt Ford.....< /Review>< Pics>

I recently bought a car from there, I worked with Alejandro.  He was a great guy to work with, he was super friendly and upbeat, and gave very good customer service.  The whole buying process went smoothly.  I was very satisfied with my experience, I would recommend this dealership and definitely recommend working with Alejandro.  I'd also like to thank the finance team, they were great and gave me a much better interest rate than other dealerships had offered me.  Thanks for everything!<//text>

<Review>The service department employees are very dsiconcerned with with giving good customer service.  You have to really struggle to get your questions answered, its like pulling teeth.  They are not overly helpful nor giving up information without you have to really press and press with questions in order to get an answer.  They are not very welcoming or polite when you enter their service department.  They kind of look past you and "appear" busy with whatever is on their desk in front of them or the fact that you are a live human that just walked in. Super disappointing.< /Review></record>

<review>I bought a pre-owner ford transit passenger at this location at the end of August 2020. Apart from a lengthy purchasing process and a none-negotiable theft protection, I was pretty happy with my experience and the service in general (let's call it 4 stars).

However,  despite a "thorough mechanical inspection for all critical / safety elements",  several issues started appearing (some of them we just noticed later):
- unbalanced front tires (on day 1 after driving it off the yard),
- bad battery (within the 1st month), and
- Leaky axle seal on both rear wheels with the fluid contaminating the brake pads and rotors. (at about 1 month)

Alright, one faulty item is not a big deal, but 3 issues (excl. the brake  pads and rotors) within a couple of months is stretching my believe that the inspection was thorough. (let's call it 3 stars - it's ok to have an off day).

Calling the dealership however soured the entire experience. I talked to Bobby who was obviously insisting that all work done was right at the time and that those are risk that come with pre-owned . Well not really Bobby: your dealership is selling a mech inspection and it is a dealership in not a private entity. As such the expectation is that your work is done thoroughly and if not, that you are willing to take care of it. After all, you do believe in the good work you are doing. To be fair to Bobby, he offered a 10% discount on labor and parts, but quite frankly, that's a bit of a f u given that most mechanics will do better. (down to 2 stars)

Bottomline: I left a star because the pricing of the pre-owned vehicle is good and because the actual sales experience was alright. I am however rather disappointed about the workmanship and what this dealership is standing behind. For that reason alone I would never recommend it to anyone.</review><userid>103991869562850980134<//userid>< Pictures>

<review>My experience in this place was effortless , I met a wonderful gentleman by the name of Rick  on Saturday 02/20 he set down with me  , honestly and openly admitted  that he was new to Ford,  but was a car salesman  for years with a different dealership, I was there for three hours test drove the Explorer without the sales person but with my family . I explained what I wanted accomplished with my trade in vehicle, they offered me a fair amount after the appraisal. overall wasn't pressured to make a decision went back the next day and purchased my ford explorer .
my only suggestion is to try to test drive the car with the sales man so he or she can educate the buyer about the car especially due to the fact that I was new to Ford as well .< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1580882782298, 'text': 'Leila, thank you for your wonderful response to the quality of service our Staff provides!We strive for 100% satisfaction, and it is great to see you had such a positive experience at Bill Brandt Ford.

Absolutely had a wonderful experience from the beginning of the process from the phone call to arriving at the dealership and meeting Art Duran who was the sales personal I spoke to the day before. Was not let down at all, just felt welcomed and had all my questions answered and had everything explained clearly from start to finish. Finance department took good care of us as well going o er all the paper explaining everything we got on the deal and if we needed to get any other service or warranty’s !  Very helpful threw the process and fast, what can I saw I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend family and friends if need arises. Thanks aging to all the helpful and awesome people here at Bill Brandt Ford!! 5 stars in my book, sincerely Chris R.<//Review>

<Text>I helped my parents purchase a used 2013 BMW X3 from Bill Brandt Ford, I went there on 10/20/2020 at 10:32am, without my parents since I didn't want them at a dealership waiting and of course the risk of COVID-19. After test driving and negotiations with my trade in and pricing, we decided to purchase the car. They were kind enough to drive me to my parent's house to sign the paper work, which was wonderful and great customer service. Once we came back to the dealership for me to take delivery of the car, as I was driving the car out of the parking lot, I immediately noticed a small crack in the windshield, which wasn't there in the test drive, the time was now 3:45pm and I've been there for a long time so I decided to proceed and drive home and email them when I get home (50 mile drive). After finally having something to eat I sent a email to my Sales Rep. Alejandro Lopez in regards to the problem, he didn't believe me so I wanted him to refer me to a manager, I haven't received a response since Monday, which was our last contact. I have insurance with State Farm that will cover the Windshield for a $75 deductible, so I wasn't lying or trying to con my way in getting a new windshield for free. I've been receiving a bunch follow up emails in regards to my experience, so here it is.<//Text>< date>

I’ve only encountered two people here that are nice, most of the stuff is rude and have terrible communication. The process was fast because I already had a pre approval ready, but besides that I’d rather give my business to nicer people who feel like they appreciate your business atleast a tad. They sold me a car that had next to no gas when I went to pick it up, and didn’t replace the oil. Just a terrible experience. I would never purchase another car from them again. DO NOT RECOMMEND if you’re looking for a pleasant car buying experience.<//Text>

<Text>Bought a used 2019 Ford Ranger at Bill Brandt. I really appreciated their no-pressure approach to sales. We were given the keys to test drive the truck without the sales person, allowing my wife and I to poke around and discuss the vehicle privately before making any decisions. All three of the sales people we dealt with during the transaction were professional, and knew all the ins and outs of the vehicle. Overall, a great dealer experience!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Name>

I bought a preowned Ford Explorer, and I spoke with Marc over the phone the day before coming in. He was prompt in replying and did a walk through around and through the vehicle with me on the phone before I made the drive to Brandt Ford to ensure everything was as expected. He was able to prepare all paperwork for the sale before I arrived so there was no delay. I arrived, drove and inspected the car, and went right on to signing. No negotiations or head games, everything seemed transparent and clear. Kenny was great and helped me through the financial paperwork, contract, and warranty stuff. Marc followed up with me the next day via email to ensure I was happy with everything. Great experience (which is rare in car sales)!<//text>

<Review>It was overall a good job by the dealership....could have been a bit faster with the procedure of customers getting to the signing of the contract. And having all the keys to the locks on the vehicle. Just don't understand why would you sell a vehicle with a key or an extra set of keys. It's not my responsibility to go and make a key for a door or that the dealership should have. Like a camper shell.  Or an extra set for the ignition....when you buy new you get two keys. I have a old vehicle...I have two sets with everything that's needed to be locked up. Other than the running around $ out of pocket that I have to spend to get keys to lock things up it was ok experience.< /Review></record>

<Review>Overall good experience as usual. They were able to get me in on short notice and have the service done by lunch. The only issue is in the "WORKS" service tire rotation is included, but if you have a dually pickup Its not done but still charge the same amount. Not a big deal but maybe $10-20 off would be cool. The only reason I took away one star was the day before the service I had my truck detailed and when i got home I saw  dirty hand prints across  the top of the chrome grill  left by the service mechanic.</Review><username>Chris Noia</username><Date>1580941742826</Date></record></dataset><record>

<text>i LOVE MY ECOSPORT BUT AM DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DID NOT COME WITH THE REAR CARGO COVER. I DID NOT NOTICE IT WAS NOT THERE DURING THE BUYING PROCESS. WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT BILL BRANDT FORD  PROVIDING THE COVER (WHICH COMES STANDARD ON MY MODEL) I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS SOLD AS IS AND I COULD PURCHASE THE COVER FOR 136.00. THAT IS NOT IN MY CURRENT BUDGET. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COVER WAS NOT SUPPLIED WITH MY CAR.

Absolutely love my new Ford Expedition from Bill Brandt Ford. They were very knowledgeable about the car and taught us how to use all the gadgets inside. They let us take the car for a test drive by ourselves, which was nice to be able to discuss and really get a feel for the car without having any pressure to buy--even though, we loved it so much we had to leave with it!<//Text>

We flew in from long Beach for an advertised car.  The car was exactly as we hoped it would be.  Great service from our salesman and we met the owner who is also a great guy.  We couldn't have asked for more.  I expect our next car will come from them too.  Take a look and you'll thank me later for the heads up.<//Review>

Very nice. Just purchased a Ford Fusion Hybrid. Luis "Chito" Almanza was my sales person and he was awesome, very helpful. Even came down on his day off to meet my schedule. The finance guy was also nice. No one was pushy and I got a good car for a good price.</Text>

Fantastic service.  Thought I had a bad battery which I wanted replaced.  Bill Brandt Ford checked the battery and said it was fine.  They said they didn't want to sell me a new battery when there was nothing wrong with the one I had.  They charged it up, did some additional service on the car--which I requested--and send me away very happy.</review>

<Review>Due to covid the process was a little odd but to be expected. The dealer did a great job despite the limitations put in place. I drove from Sacramento to buy my vehicle and was not able to drive it home that day due to smog and safety needed to be done still but they delivered it to me a couple days later with brand new tires on it. Only complaint is whatever tire vendor they used had the air pressure at 50psi on all 4 tires. Something you definitely want to check to ensure they're set properly. Prices on their vehicles are fantastic, even a friend of mine who worked at a high volume Ford dealer before covid happened said it was a great price. Thanks again!</Review>< pictures>

Horrible customer service from the start. Tried to come to an agreement, worked out financing, and was told I’d have the vehicle delivered to me next day earlier the better for them. Needed to wrap it up in the morning. But oh wait, they forgot to tell me about a large scratch on the driver side of the vehicle until they locked in price. Wouldn’t budge, “because it’s a clean truck” but I said ok I’ll move forward. So then comes the day of “delivery”. They need to get the financing wrapped up and they’ll be on the way, but then the financing people haven’t shown up because they are getting new tires on their car. Few hours go by. Called me again saying they quoted me from a credit union but my license wasn’t from in state so that credit union won’t work. So an hour later they call again and say the interest was just a little higher but no worries the payments only jumped $100 per month. I said that’s not what I agreed to, and the vehicle was supposed to be here by now. But they called back and told me they can’t meet those numbers they agreed with me on, if I wanted to be closer to THEIR numbers I needed an extra 1000 down, then it would only be 50 bucks higher than they said it would be the day before delivery. I said no that’s not what we agreed on, and the manager called and said I was trying to pinch pennies on the purchase. I thought that’s what people do when buying a vehicle? That ended  up being the final straw of an absolute nightmare car purchase. The one person that seemed to have any sort of morals and ethics was Marc. Absolutely shady business. I understand needing to make money as a dealer but actually treating other people badly just reflects on not only the sales people but the company as a whole. Won’t give them a penny</Text>

DO NOT GO HERE! I saw the listing for a used Subaru online and went in thinking it had features that the website claimed it had. However, when I drove all the way there the car was gross, the engine battery had so much corrosion, and the features I was willing to pay extra for, which they said they HAD online, (bluetooth, back up camera, etc) didn't exist. The salesman didn't know anything about the car and was really rude/sexist (unsure which but he made us want to never come back). He was trying to sell us the car before I had even driven it and after I told him about the misleading online advertisement. They didn't really care that the online statements about the car's features were lies and tried to sell it to us by telling us that other people were coming to see it and that it wouldn't last (yeah right, I doubt anyone would wanna buy that overpriced car with a misleading online description). Also the car was gross as heck, again do not go here they are terrible/mean.< /Text>

Service and friendliness was very evident, until we signed the paperwork. After that we had to chase the salesman to finish up telling us the basic function of the car. Art the finance guy stated he would call the salesman, whether he did or not, I don't know. An employee passing by helped me with connecting my phone to the car - he was the best because he did not have anything to gain, other than representing BILL Brant Ford Inc. Also he called the salesman to come over and finish up with what he had committed to do.  In the long run don't pretend to provide the red carpet treatment and not follow through, I really did not expect anything in the first place.  I can't even remember the salesman name, that is how much of an impression he left.</Review>

<text>Veterans stand fast! Dealership salesman  extremely sneaky and conniving. No negotiations considered at all, even as simple as floor mats, or a full tank of gas after purchase denied.. Salesman stated "We are cheap here." The only way you will be able to purchase from this particular dealership is if you use in house financing. USAA & Navy Federal pre financed Battles stand clear unless willing to take another hard hit on your credit report. Not worth it.<//text>< pictures>

<text>This place was great! Timothy is the most genuine salesman I’ve ever met. The used car inventory is priced well below market value on all of the cars so there’s really no negotiating. After 3 weeks of going to countless dealers looking for a car I got to see all the tricks salesmen try on people. With that being said, Nobody tried any shady sales tactics here. I felt very comfortable buying from Bill Brandt Ford. The whole process was quick and easy. Leon in finance explained all the warranty and extra packages to me and made the finalizing process go very smooth. I would recommend friends and family, and I will be buying from here again in the future.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I took my car for a trans fault warning light on the instrument panel. The car would not start and had to be towed to the Dealership. The car arrived at 4:30pm and by the next morning at 10:30am the car was fixed. I was lucky as the fix was under warranty. Every time I bring my vehicles to the Dealership I'm always treated very well and am provided great service. Plus the courtesy shuttle is a big plus.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Well, if you want the best deal on a used car, go to Bill Brandt. I can't tell you how much I saved by shopping the entire Bay Area and finally ending up at Bill Brandt Ford in Brentwood. Yea, okay you think I work there or have a family member that does; nope not true. I'm live in Hayward, CA and drove the hour to get the best deal possible. Bought a 2016 Ford F-150 for a dirt cheap price. The truck is immaculate even though it has a great deal of miles on it. Bill Brandt Ford's price was between 10 and 15 thousand less than any other dealer in the Bay Area.........keep up the great work and can do spirit Greg!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<text>This is a fantastic dealership and we had a great buying experience. Everyone we worked with was direct, kind, and knowledgeable. The two we worked most closely with - Marc the sales guy and Carlo the finance guy - both said 'we'll take good care of you' and they meant it. We got the deal we wanted, drove home, and thought 'this could not have gone better.'  I actually decided to consider this dealership a few months back, when the dealership hosted our Mustang club's car show. They could not have been more hospitable and literally opened the doors to the dealership - on a Saturday, no less - for our event. We drove past three Ford dealerships to get to Bill Brandt, and we'd do it again in a second. Highly recommend!<//text>< UserId.>

< Review>
Amazing experience at Bill Brandt Ford in Brentwood. That's not what you usually hear when people talk about a dealership but it was truly amazing here. From the first day I reached out on the internet to the day we finally purchased it was great never felt rushed or obligated to purchase anything. Through email Jason sent me every option I could think of and once we settled on 2 vehicles made an appointment to go in and test drive. Never have i been able to test drive vehicles almost all day to make sure it fit my needs and I was sure that's the vehicle I wanted. After the all day test drive my wife my 2 yr old and I went in to make sure the numbers would work and again felt great. Not rushed. My son literally was running around the building and no1 actually minded but actually played with him and even made him some amazing popcorn. I can go on and on about how the experience was great from start to finish and how they treated us like family but something you should definitely experience if your looking for a vehicle.< /Review>

Brian (service) has been excellent helping me with my bent wheels. He has gone above and beyond ( and I hope he can continue) getting this problem solved. after all, a Lincoln should  not vibrate down the road.  Thanks again. (His work is appreciated!)
The Dealership is neat, clean, and friendly. The renovation looks good.
My only complaint is that the coffee pot has only 2 cups ever left in it and  the consistency and flavor reminds me of old motor oil. Solution: Coffee machine like other dealerships. :>)<//text>

Steve was great and they stayed true to the price listed on true car - no haggling, so it was very congenial and completely straightforward. They did not seem to fully know the details of the accessories loaded on the car (to be fair, it was a MINI and not a ford) and they could not live up to the 90minute pledge (it took more like 2.5 hrs to get out of there; we were not financing and hence were not prioritized in “checkout”). But the car seems to run fine and they were nice guys. So, four out of five, I guess?< /Review>

<text>Last time they serviced my car everything went very well and I gave 5 stars. With regret I have to lower the rating based on a few things. I had to call to get status more than once (part needed ordering and missed shipment) . I was told they would call when the car was ready , but I had to call to find out it was complete. The time frame given for the repair was inaccurate and they had the car 3 days. The coolant bottle was deemed to be leaking but wasn't covered. I tried to get this covered based on the fact that they did move it around last time they worked on that portion of car recently.  I felt like once I complained about this I was being treated differently. I hope that is not the case .  I feel like even if things are not going to be covered and there is some grey area car dealerships do everything they can to deflect .  Come to find out they have these break all the time so Ford knows they have an inferior part they continue to install in their new cars .Maybe employees are not  empowered? . Being in Customer Service for over 20 years on a very high level I feel they should treat customers with more empathy and understanding and be more customer focused,  I do appreciate them repairing the car under the warranty and ordering the parts needed so I can repair this issue myself. I will continue to take my car there and perhaps buy my next car there. As I said with regret I have to give this feedmack</text>< Pics>

I found a car that I really liked but the dealership offered me a very low price for my car. I decided to sell it privately and came back the VERY NEXT DAY with my down payment. The salesman said he would keep the car tucked away for me til the next day and sure enough as I arrive someone is leaving with the car I picked. As upsetting as that was I ended up finding a slightly better model I liked and went with that. The sales people seemed to have better things to do as I found myself sitting in the lobby waiting for the next sheet of paper I needed to fill out. Finally after roughly 5 hours I was leaving but without my car. They still needed to detail the vehicle and repair a crack in the glass on the windshield. 3 days later and I still don’t have my car. The salesman are good people from what I can tell but the service was sub par. Supposedly I am finally getting it tomorrow. We’ll see. On the other hand, their prices aren’t bad and the cars they keep on the lot are nice.</Review><Name>Augustine Strange< /Name><UserId.>111310496006767063793</UserId.><Date>1522705668498<//Date>< Response>

This was the easiest, most pleasant car buying experience we have ever had. Juan was great to work with, and answered all our questions. He was very straight forward. Carlo was the best finance guy to work with. We expected to be there for hours, like with other car dealers. We were in and out of finance in under an hour. Such a pleasure.< /text>

Just got into a new 2019 Mustang Gt. I worked with Jason and he was amazing and accommodated me any way he could. He gave me a killer deal all around. They even delivered the car to my doorstep. Doesn't get anymore convenient then that! By far the best car buying experience for me to date.<//Review>

I was extremely disappointed yesterday when I dropped off my 2011 Escape that I had purchased from Bill Brandt Ford to be worked on. I felt very taken advantage of as a single woman who does not know anything about fixing cars. The quote I recieved to fix my car was astronomical. My car hasn't had anything wrong with it since I bought it except for my air conditioning going out 2 years ago then the coolant leak the other day.  The quote I received was almost as much as the car was worth. After I recieved the estimate I did some research at 2 other car repair places. Both quoted me a cost that was almost 1/2 of what BIll Brandt Ford quoted me. I called back and told them the reason I brought my car back to them to work on it was because I bought my car there and in good faith I believed they would treat me right. I also found out that not everything they told me was wrong with the car needed to be fixed right away. Iended up asking for just the water pump to be fixed and for a discount since I purchased the car from them. He gave me new quote which was still $400 more than the other quotes I recieved. It was an expensive lesson as the estimate cost me $185. But I am still saving at least $200 in the long run as I take my car back to a Brentwood Auto Repair where Julio never takes advantage and always keeps my cost at a minimum, doing only what is really needed. As a single woman I have always hated bringing my car in for this very reason I typically I get treated with disrespect because of my lack of knowledge and not given the entire truth and quotes that are much higher. I was very disappointed with this experience, I was just trying to support my local car dealer, instead I will support my local car repair business.<//text>

Untrustworthy- I bought a Jeep Compass with them and prior body/paint damage wasn't disclosed at time of purchase which greatly devalued the car when I went to trade it in at another dealership. I overpaid for a damaged car and would definitely not recommend them to anyone looking for an honest deal.</text>

<review>I wanted to share my experience with Bill Brant Ford in Brentwood and let it be a lesson to those contemplating in doing business with them; do your due diligence and don’t believe everything you see or hear!! I purchased a Certified Pre-Owned 2017 Ford Mustang Eco Boost from the dealer back in May. At first, I was extremely thrilled and excited to have found this dealership because they had the best price for this specific model. I went to look and test drive the car, it looked fairly clean (aside from a few minor scratches) and drove great. Since I really liked the car I decided to pull the trigger. At the time when we were working through the paperwork, I was told the car was a previous rental and the CARFAX Report was clean, no accidents whatsoever! All sounded great and I proceeded with the purchase.

Fast forward a month later, I had a minor parking lot accident when someone bumped into my car and scratched the paint on the door.  The owner of the other car took full responsibility of the damage and I managed to take my car into a body shop for a repair. Needless to say, although it was a minor scratch on the door, the door and the side quarter panel had to be removed and the whole side of the car had to be repainted. I was bummed, but knowing the car would get a fresh coat of paint, I was eager to get my car back.

A week later, I received an email from the body shop telling me the car was ready! But here is the kicker: they noticed the quarter panel had been repaired before; the bumper didn’t fit right in the front on the right side!! And because of that repair, the bumper gap is now a little off. I was completely shocked and puzzled!! How could there be a previous repair when clearly, no one at the dealership or CARFAX documented such repair was ever done?

I called the dealership and spoke to the salesperson, he adamantly refused knowing there was a previous repair job on the car and asked what exactly I wanted from this…. since he couldn’t come up with any helpful solution he said he would have the general manager called me in a day or two to discuss. A week has passed, and guess what? No phone call whatsoever! I guess Bill Brant Ford is happy they got one sale from me, and doesn’t really care about any future repeated business (from me or anyone I know)!

I am going to report this to the Ford headquarter and the Better Business Bureau! It is such a pity!! I REALLY, REALLY enjoy my car…. it’s a shame because of unethical behaviors of some dealerships I will not be buying any more Ford vehicles in the future.<//review>< pics>

My wife and I went to multiple Ford stores looking to purchase a Ford Explorer. After being haggled on our trade-in and constantly shown cars out of our budget (even after telling them exactly what we could afford), we had practically given up. Then we saw an advertisement for Bill Brandt Ford. We told them what we wanted and what kind of payments we could make. Instead of showing us multiple vehicles outside of our price range, they got us exactly what we wanted at the price we wanted. They don't negotiate on price, because everything is already at a fair price. No BS, no haggling, no general sliminess. Our salesman Jason, had us in and out in a few hours and was amazingly helpful. I will be purchasing vehicles exclusively through Bill Brandt Ford, specifically Jason, in the future. If you are sick of sales people trying to take advantage of you and your new family, give Jason a call. He'll help you out.<//text>< pics>

I am very pleased with the service I had received on my 2009 Ford F450!   I had been using other Dealers and Diesel shops in the past, and these guys had the best service and price.  I was also referred by a friend who had service there recently including a complete new motor replacement on his 6.7L diesel.  I work for a retail company that is in home improvement, and I am in charge of the contractors desk M-F. Therefore I deal with contractors all day long, and occasionally discuss issues with the workers as well as their business owners.  So now I will refer any and all of them to this dealership for all their truck and diesel truck needs.  I also work for a sign company part time, and I will switch all of our service on our bucket trucks to this dealership. They not only do great service, but excellent customer service as well. I also happen to race motorcycles, and most of my friends have Fords towing their 5th wheels and other Toy Hauler trailers, so I will definitely recommend Bill Brandt Ford for all their service needs.  Thanks for everything Dave and the rest of the team!  Norm “The Flash” #797.<//Review>

Great service and the best price I could find. I did a lot of research on the type of truck and pricing on all local sites and on carmax and found the best price for what I was looking for at Bill Brant. Jason Campos and Greg Renwick were excellent to work with! They both helped me through the process and left out all the pretend behind the curtain sales stuff. I went in, told them what I was looking for, told them the payment, and they did the rest. I will always make this my first choice of dealerships to go to from now on. Worth your trip if you are from out of town. Thank you Greg and Jason, and the great staff over there!< /Text>

<review>Not happy with the 2017 Jeep Cherokee I purchased yesterday when I did the test drive it seem to drive fine but once I drove on the highway it felt as though the transmission was slipping.Not sure what the exact problem is with this vehicle but I haven’t had it 24 hrs and for it to be having mechanical issues isn’t a good sign.Cleary this car already had problems before I purchased it not sure if the dealership knew this or not but to sale me a 19,000 car with mechanical problems is dead wrong.<//review>< Time>

2009 Ford Escape has problems losing power steering while driving and it was recalled. Took it in and they stated no recall for 2009 Ford Escape power steering going out. Now my vehicle has no power steering and not many shops are familiar with putting in a angler torque piece so my wheel will recognize power steering.</Review>

<text>I used the Quick Lane Service Center at Bill Brandt Ford for an oil change and tire rotation. They were able to fit me in for same day service and treated me extremely well while I was there. They offered to drive me home if I needed a ride and to pick me up later or told me I was welcome to wait which is what I chose to do. They were very friendly, efficient, and I was in and out in under an hour. I would highly recommend Bill Brandt Ford in there Quick Lane Service<//text>< pictures>

We have now bought several car's from here, our latest is a Ford Fusion for my husband, he loves it. Our sales guy was Juan, he is GREAT, no pressure, honest, answered all my questions, very responsive to calls/texts. When car shopping see Juan. Our whole experience with this dealership was great, also one of the owners took the time to introduce himself to us, very down to earth people here :)< /Review>

<text>Took my car (2016 Focus ST) in for a check engine light, car was misfiring.

They diagnosed the car and found a faulty head gasket.

During the repair they messed up the timing, and broke a few parts (dip stick.. how do you break that?!)

What gets me is in the report I received of the work performed, it doesn’t state any of their mishaps. It simply states: reset timing... replaced oil dip stick...

Why were these things done? No need for any explanation? Just break things or mess up an install and don’t state it... shady...

When I finally got the car back, they had wiped down the whole inside of the car with a wanna-be armor all that has a very, very strong odor and made the whole car super slippery.

The car is fixed for now, however the quality of work preformed was not what I was hoping for from such a high rated dealership.</text></record></dataset><record>

Yader was the sales consultant that assisted us with the vehicle test drive and purchase. He was very professional, paid attention and listened to my questions, overall a very nice guy. Raul and Leon from finance were very accommodating. They were patient throughout the dealing process and they were able to give us a great deal on the purchase of our F-150 . This was our first Ford purchase and we were glad that we went to Bill Brandt Ford of Brentwood. The whole team that help us was exceptional, they made our first Ford purchase easy and hassle free. Thank you.</text>

Drove to Brentwood Ford on a post from Car Gurus. A bit of a drive for us coming from Fremont area. But it was so worth the drive. No pressure. Showed us the car on the site, no “that car is sold but let me show u this.....” typical sales approach. Nope they had the car!  Art was our sales guy nice guy and made sure we were updated thru the process. Told him I was surprised about the laid back vibe and he said they are family owned. Atmosphere is more relaxed and family geared. You can tell. The finance guy was the same family friendly vibe and quick! I bought a used commuter car and next is my F150, will go back to Bill Brandt Ford and see Art when we r ready.
Thank you BB Ford!< /Text>

Everything went great during purchase process. WE were very disappointed in the fact that after we drove off the lot with our new truck, we had an empty tank of gas... it really bothered my husband that after making this big of a purchase, there was no thought in filling our tank of gas up for customer satisfaction....</Text>

<Review>I bought my first car purchase with them today, and they went above and beyond. The service was top notch and incredibly helpful in answering all our questions. Also had great financing options and incredibly friendly staff that were able to get us the best deal possible. With an extremely large inventory of used cars priced always in the top three best deals. Their marketing and service is extraordinary, they will help you find the best fit for you. Extremely grateful to their whole staff.< /Review>< user_name>

Bill Brandt Ford Staff were very helpful and professional with our recent purchase of a used vehicle. During the DMV registering process the agent working with us contacted the staff person responsible for collecting taxes and talked to a very polite and helpful person. My agent commented to me that it was a most pleasant contact, not a usual experience. If anyone were to ask me, I would recommend Bill Brandt Ford in Brentwood, California for a vehicle purchase, either new or used. Thank you for a most positive car buying experience.

<Text>Came to Bill Brandt Ford because I had my eye on a nice car. Soon as I approached the car I was greeted by a very helpful and respectful salesperson by the name of Hector. He then threw me the keys to the car let me go for a test drive with my family came back did a little bit of paperwork and the car was mine. Hector did everything to make me get a good rate make sure I was comfortable offered me refreshments and kept me company when paperwork was being done. If you decide to buy a car from here ask for Hector even though everybody else was so helpful he was the best.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We just purchased our Expedition from a Jason at Bill Brandt Ford, and had the best experience. Jason was so knowledgeable and helpful, plus his enthusiasm for our purchase made it a exciting too. He followed through with every detail and even took the time to program our phones and teach how to navigate the many options. Thank Jason & the Bill Brandt team- we will be back next time we are ready to purchase.< /text>

It's always s a great experience. Bill Brandt employees definitely have excellent Customer Service.  Brian Cornellius from Service department has displayed great qualities from start to finish. He would always give me an update. He has a very positive aura.  He would make suggestions if he knows he cannot deliver.  It is nice to know someone you can trust especially when it comes to your vehicle.

Thanks Brian for a great service.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>My friend and I drove more than one hour and arrived in the late afternoon. I was waiting the whole day to get a test drive because there was another person looking at the car before I came, but the 1 star was not for a long day waiting. We spent about 20 min and had to leave because clearly they didn’t want my business.

After we arrived, I walked in by myself and soon found Jason and his partner Steve. Steve was a really nice guy to show us the vehicle immediately. I found that the windshield  of the car I want has been replaced so I asked why the reason was. Steve said he doesn’t know and that was when Jason stepped in. He basically either tried to persuade me it’s not a big deal or tried steering away from my question about what happened. He interrupted me many times and I found very difficult to let him understand I was just very concerned about what may have happened, like an accident.

He even asked me to his office where he sit in front the computer to show me the Carfax which was on their website and which I obviously had checked before coming. He was never patient and was in a bad mood. I understand maybe it was because of the previous owner who spent a lot time and didn’t make a deal. I stopped talking and tried listening to him but he was talking like I was not interested and being picky. Why would I waste so much time and ask my friend such a big favor to drive a long way for this? After talking in his office and me spending like 5 min around the car, he said we can shake hands and go our own way. OK I figured out he didn’t have that patience to show me the details of the vehicle or tried reasoning me about the replacement of the windshield. I just felt nervous talking to him because he just kept talking without caring about his customer, who was tired and worried. I felt so frustrated because I thought I would be able to get a car I wanted. There were many emails between us before I came. I felt I should have been treated better for my business and if it was Steve who talked to me about the car we could have made a deal. They didn’t try keeping me or giving me other options when I said we shouldn’t keep debating.

Hands down  the best car buying  experience I’ve ever had. As a single
women buying a car,
it can be very frustrating and intimidating.  Cody was
so great! He was straight forward and listened to what I asked for. He delivered on what he said he would do. There was nothing hidden and I didn’t feel pressured in any way. I felt taken care of. I got a great price on the car and never felt like I was being taken. I would recommend Bill Brandt dealership!!!!<//Text>

I bought my car at Bill Brandt Ford, and had it serviced for the first time yesterday. Now I know that both the sales side and the service side are excellent. Jason Campos, who sold me my Fiesta, has taken good care of me from sales to answering my questions about service. He follows through and is committed to his customers. My experience having my car serviced was  also excellent. The people were professional, friendly, and on time. I could have my car serviced closer to home,  but I'll return to Bill Brandt instead. Oh, and did I mention that I love my Ford Fiesta?</review>

Mike was the best, not pushy at all. Never felt pressured at all. He came as close as he could to what we wanted to pay and the whole process was super fast. Couldn't be happier. I will be back when it comes time to replace my other car.</Review>

Great service for my Toyota Camry.   I was very impressed for just an oil change that I was given a status on my brakes, tires and offered a ride to my home.  Our vehicles will always be serviced at Bill Brandt Ford.</review>

<Review>Purchased a used 2017 F-150 from Bill Brandt.  Over all purchase was good, experience generally OK but follow-up by salesman was pretty non-existent.  Made several phone calls to salesman, said he would get back to me but never heard any call back.  Felt that once they had my money - they were done with me.   Needed to have warrantee work done on battery and used car dept. was excellent in getting that done - very helpful there.   I just felt that the sales end of the experience was lacking.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I’m still trying to find out how at almost 100,000 miles my brakes were not replaced and they actually regenerated from previous inspections. I will be going back in to find out how after all these miles part of the brakes could be rated 8. Impossible and an improvement from previous inspections. Explain that to me.</Text>

Bought a MKZ hybrid and was very happy with how I was treated by Jason.  Never thought I'd buy a car, sight unseen but I felt very comfortable with the process. The couple (the Hummels) who delivered the car were very nice and meeting them helped reassure me that I was dealing with good people.  A very good buying experience.< /Review>

My husband & I bought our 2017 Dodge Charger last night.  I couldn’t be happier not only with the car but with the customer service this dealership provided.  We arrived 40 minutes before closing. They didn’t rush us , let us make phone calls to our insurance and got the paperwork done quickly.  I highly recommend this dealership if you are looking for great customer service! Thanks again to everyone at Bill Brandt Ford!<//Review>

<review>Called the service department late on Monday and was able to get it in before they closed. I am traveling for business and 500 miles from my home, so I was nervous about leaving my Explorer with a new dealership. They assured me it would be looked at on Tuesday and by Tuesday afternoon, the vehicle was fixed and ready for pick up. Very honest and friendly. Would buy a car from here in a minute.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>My parents have purchased vehicles from Bill Brandt Ford since I was young, so it made sense to buy my first vehicle from them too. I found the best price on a used 2017 Chrysler Pacifica there, even though it's not Ford I didn't think that would be an issue. Well after a couple months of driving it, the check engine light came on. I took it in to a Chrysler dealership closer to where we live (in the North Bay) and they found in the vehicle's history that that code had come up before we bought it, but it was cleared without the problem being fixed!! Apparently since our extended warranty is through Bill Brandt, we found out that shop couldn't work on it but we still had to pay $200 just for diagnosis with no real progress. (Later I found out from BB that we could ask for them to release the vehicle to be repaired by another shop if it's at least 40 miles away but decided to take it back to make things less complicated.) So when we were finally able to take it back to Bill Brandt, they fixed it at no charge; granted we also have the extended warranty, but it was very appreciated. Moral of the story: only buy Fords here, so you don't get in a hairy mess with warranties, and check the history before buying!</text><user_id>115097811525324761401</user_id><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808ffeea09ad5045:0x3506cbcb5138aaff</gmapID><Date>1575908776434<//Date>< Rate>

Great experience with Sal @ Bill Brandt in Brentwood. He was helpful and honest. I ended up purchasing a used car from their lot across the street and her made sure that every thing that was either missing or needed fixing was taken car of. They also honored their online prices for their vehicles which they said was only for the weekend. Thanks, Sal!< /text>

Never heard from the Service department that my truck was ready. So I called today "Saturday" and truck was ready for pickup. The kid who brought my truck up for pickup parked it on the other side of the lot and was full of Attitude & just started me Down. You guys just lost a customer!!!  I'll stick with Future Ford from now on.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Colton was very helpful from the get go. Called from Sacramento to ask about the car and he was very responsive. Went as far as sending me additional pictures. Once we got there he answered all our questions. Just ran our credit sign some documents and we were out the door with our 2016 explorer.

Great customer service.< /Text>

<Text>I usually post to Yelp but read through the google reviews since I saw the list while on the Bill Brandt site. I was really stunned by all of the bad reviews. I bought my new 2017 Ford Escape last November. Our sales guy was Arthur and the sales manager was Newman. My buddy also bought his new Ford Explorer at the same time. Our experience was great. Everyone is very nice and helpful. It was a pleasant experience and everything was quick and easy. Everyone there is very, very nice. Dave in Service is very customer focused and detailed in his explanations. I had 1 issue with the door handle and they replaced it quickly. I've only had 1 maintenance appt. for oil change and that was fine. Next one is scheduled. My buddy and I would definitely come here again and have recommended the dealership to friends and neighbors.</Text><gmap_id>0x808ffeea09ad5045:0x3506cbcb5138aaff</gmap_id><date>1501606399650< /date>< userid>

Bill Brandt Ford is the hometown dealership that makes you feel like family. I recommend if you’re within 100 mile radius you should purchase your ford units at Bill Brandt Ford you’ll be very happy with the customer service and overall experience. They have a huge inventory, it’s worth the drive 🚙😜🚗🚚< /review>

The staff here was extremely friendly and helpful for our needs. The vehicle we bought was well under market value, and the time it took to finance it was relatively short. All and all a great place to buy a new or used vehicle.< /Text>

We’ve recently purchased a used car from Bill Brandt Ford, sure it was used and not the most expensive vehicle but the treatment we received from our salesman Corey Hummel was top notch. Corey facilitated our trade in without a hassle, he helped watch my kids while I went for a test drive, and the paperwork process was completely painless.
Bill Brandt Ford also put new brakes and tires on the vehicle.
We drove away with our car very happy with the deal. Then the next day I noticed that the vehicle was making a weird sound, I called Corey right away and he was able to get us in the same day and was able to fix the problem the same day, which was a godsend because with 2 kids in car seats it’s quite a hassle to do anything really.
We’ll definitely come back to Bill Brandt Ford when it comes time for our next car.</Text>

The team at Bill Brandt Ford was fantastic on getting our C-Max fixed up. Needed rear hatch and camera replaced and a few minor items. Having Cystic Fibrosis (and being hospitalized just before I was supposed to drop off car) and a son who’s 18 months old they did everything they could to accommodate our family. Thank you especially to Daniel Brandt!</review>

Took car in for a re-call and to take a look at something else. They completed the re-call and then told me ahead of time how much it would cost and that they had the part in stock and how long it would take to fix the other issue. Although I didn’t go with the additional work, it wasn’t because of anything negative.  Always very professional and there’s no surprise what they’re so busy all the time. Everyone wants to take their cars there!< /Review>

<text>Jason was absolutely outstanding! He helped me finance one of my long awaited dream cars (A Kona Blue 2012 mustang)! He spent well over and hour trying to help me situate and figure every small detail out. I am highly satisfied and happy that I was able to work with him! Will plan on coming back in the future to purchase a vehicle from them!

<Text>Ford Fusion just turned 100k mi and the check engine light came on.  I'm thinking, really, is this programmed to go off at 100k mi?  Had to take it in for an oil change anyway, and had the check engine light checked, thinking to worst.  Turns out is was something minor and was covered on my warranty.  I also noted to them about a cracked boot, which was also covered under my warranty.  This is great because i nearly paid close to $500 to have this repair by tire company that brought it my attention...few, glad i waited.

Bottom line, the service was amazing, prompt communication, quick turnaround, etc.  Top notch!

Purchased the Ford Fusion (Titanium) here as well.  Would recommend not hesitate to recommend them, or the Ford Fusion (Titanium); Win-Win!</Text><Rating>5</Rating><Response>{'time': 1587139455228, 'text': "John, we're pleased to hear everything was completed to your satisfaction!

I got affordable car.
But it have 2 recall items including engin stall issue but dealer said it is safe. There might be no explanation about that if I didn’t asked.
Furthermore, I recognized no spare key after buy the car.
I think still it is good car but need to be careful.</Text>

<Text>Bill Brandt Ford really took care of problem that another Ford dealer couldn’t/wouldn’t diagnose. Parts were ordered and my Ford was good to go. Did I mention the fabulous service? The service at Bill Brandt Ford is what you would expect from a company and individuals who take pride in a job well done. I will never go to another Ford service center again!

Jason did a great job with us.  He was helpful and helped guide us through the process of purchasing our Ford Lariat.  He's also been very caring and helpful after the sale- since truck is used, he's getting us the owners manual and arranged for a minor repair (shroud below transmission was missing a clip).  5 stars!<//text>

Called was told a car was in stock (gave them the stock number) setup to go out there, nope it was sold days before but we have this other one that is more and older. Liked that car and was ok with price considering the options. Agree on the price sit down to do paperwork and now we have additional mandatory options that are policy. Went back and forth with them on security tags that add nothing to the vehicle and cost nothing to the dealer and they would not honor the agreed upon price. There are many ford dealers out there pick one with integrity.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808ffeea09ad5045:0x3506cbcb5138aaff< /gmapID></record>

<text>We live in Brentwood and drive by the dealership often. This dealership has a ton of inventory for their used vehicles. We ask for Mark every time we go in!!  He’s friendly, laid back, informative and patient. We never felt pressured or rushed. We test drove many options and even gave his own personal experience with the same vehicle. When we needed space to make final decisions, Mark was understanding and gave us plenty of time. The price of the cars are already low so there was no negotiating. I would return for future vehicle needs.<//text>< pictures>

Buying a car through Bill Brandt Ford was hassle free and a pleasure. Our sales person as well as the sales manager and right down to the financing agent  had a "can-do"  attitude.  I told them I did not want a hard sell  as I do not make decisions under pressure. So they did not pressure me and they gave me just the facts and I was able to determine for myself that the deal they gave me was a good one. They were very honest, answered all my questions.
I would highly recommend them  to anyone.< /text>

I went into Bill Brandt Ford because I had bought a car from them before and knew how they handle business. They are no hassle , respectable and a class act. Mike went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed and felt comfortable about my purchase. I would highly recommend Bill Brandy Ford.<//review>

I purchased a 2014 Ford Focus SE Hatchback from these guys and have nothing but problems with it since. When I spoke with the sales guy I pointedly asked if the warranty issues with the vehicle had been taken care of. There has been some transmission issues with this year and model. The salesman assured me that all of the warranties had been taken care of when they went through their 172 point inspection. This was not true. Three weeks after purchasing this car the clutch went out in it. Luckily it was covered under an extended warranty and was replaced. Then the power window in the passenger side started having issues with difficulty closing. Now the horn just stopped working and there is a rattle coming from somewhere underneath the vehicle when I accelerate.
I recommend you be very cautious when purchasing from this dealership and make sure you take the vehicle to a 3rd party for inspection before purchasing. They are focused on hustling vehicles and meeting sales goals. I was not impressed with the experience with these guys and disappointed with my first vehicle purchase from a "legitimate" Ford dealership. It feels like they cut corners at the buyers expense.</text>

<review>I went in to get a car but unfortunately I wasnt able to get the one I wanted without a cosigner. However the guys found me a price range that was suitable for me and they helped me find a vehicle that fit my needs and wants. I left happy with a car I can be comfortable with driving and was in my budget. Art Duran was super helpful in finding a car that fit my needs and has a great personality so if your looking for a car with the best deals within a 200 mile radius of Brentwood go check out bill Brandt ford and talk to Art he’ll make sure your auto needs are met.

Purchased a used car, unfortunately the LCD screen that Bill Brant had already replaced is not working. I spoke with Pete, who offered to cover the replacement cost at a dealership much closer to us.
I really appreciate them taking care of the problem and will be buying a truck there in the near future</text>

Bill Brandt Ford is very thorough. I like the desk staff very much, however there is a disconnect between them and the mechanics in the lube bays. Maybe tooo many bosses and not enough Indians. Sat and waited 2.5 hours for truck to get finished.Appreciated the ride home and pick up at home.</text>

Had electrical issues.  Went back a couple of times.  Finally we found the problem.  Everyone was so great this last time.  Yes I was frustrated but they took the time to be so caring, explaining everything in detail.  Even the Manager of service talked to me.
They brought down my frustration with such care and respect.  Electrical problems is a process sometimes.  I felt so great with how they cared and yes problems all fixed.</review>

<Review>We recently purchased a Ford Explorer Limited 4WD from Jason Campos. He provided excellent service and truly helped us through the transaction of our purchase. Jason did a complete presentation of what our new family vehicle can do from all the technology to sharing some great history with ford. My wife and I are both very happy to have taken delivery of our new SUV from Bill Brandt Ford.

< Review>
Nick who was my contact and kept me updated on service and repair was AWESOME!  My Fusion had ck engine light and finding issue was a bit more difficult but Nick kept me informed every step of the way. Service at Bill Brandt Ford I highly recommend.

My only suggestion is to Mr. Brandt. Please purchase your young shuttle driver a smart phone so his phone is Bluetooth capable. He should be hands free when taking calls from you all for other customers who need pick up. PLEASE invest in this!! Safety should always before $ cost. Thank You</Review>

< Review>
Nick worked hard for me, pulling different vehicles I wanted to look at and test drive. He was polite and happy to serve. The no pressure sales process was also very pleasant. I didn't feel pressured or stressed at all. Chuck in finance was personable, explained all the paperwork and we got it done in less than an hour. I was really impressed with all of the choices available for pre-owned vehicles and will definitely recommend Bill Brandt Ford to friends and family. The only less than stellar part of the experience is they didn't fill up the gas tank. They only give you 1/4 tank when you buy a used vehicle. I guess I get it but still, a full tank would have added to my buying experience.</Review>

I went to Bill Brandt Ford for a couple of reasons. 1) Recall repair 2) Warranty Repair 3) Oil Change. My concern/issue is this is the second time this vehicle has been in for the recall. The first time they did not have the tool necessary to complete the recall so I had to bring it in a second time. I was told they would do a detail on my vehicle and fill my car with gas as a way to compensate for having to come back a second time. The detail was subpar in fact there was gun wrappers left in my cup holders ( just one example )and my gas tank was not filled up. The Warranty Repair was  the bar that holds up my lift gate came off. In my mind this was a safety concern because I could not use the back portion of my car. This is where my spare tire is stored and because of this defect it essentially made the back portion of my car useless. I had to wait almost 2 weeks for an appointment I feel under the circumstances I should have got an earlier appointment. The repairs were done adequately enough I just was not happy with the detail and time it took< /text>

<review>I had a very good experience at Bill Brandt Ford with both sales and service. I was not able to buy my new (used) truck here, but not their fault. They just didn’t have what I was looking for at the time and I found it at another dealer.
However, I did have some problems with the truck that required a dealers attention right off. Bill Brandt Ford totally took care of me as the closest dealer. They have shuttle service to/from where you need to be within their “sphere of influence.”  Great service. I have no problem recommending them.</review>< Pics>

Worst experience I've ever had at a dealership. I pulled up and immediately saw there is zero customer parking.  The street they are on is high traffic, so I pulled into the lot.  No room there either, but I found a space.

I came in to look at a 2018 F-250 Lariat.  The salesman I had been talking to was occupied with customers, so I was paired with their salesman named Franklin.   Has we are walking to view the truck, I asked it where I parked was ok.  I was given a sarcastic "you're already parked there so..."

Franklin gets the truck, which is across the street, and doesn't really engage me, he just says take it for a test drive and asks for my license.   I handed him my license and he started to walk back to the main building.   He fully intended to hold my license.   I asked him if he wasnt going on the drive, he said "no", I stopped him and said "I not driving with my license man, what if I get stopped".  He said "ok, I'll need to hold the key to your car."  I told him im not giving him my car key, im not playing that game.  I said he could photo copy my license.  But has he was doing that, the exchange that just took place sunk in and i becane very upset.  I took my license back, the copy he made and headed to the manager's office.  The owner was there and trued to defuse the situation, but the damage is done.

That was the most unprofessional salesman ive ever talked to.  The dealership feels unfriendly and nothing there encourages you to come in.  There are literally dozens of Ford dealers in the bay area, who at the very least, help you feel welcomed there.

Bill Brandt Ford is off my list forever.   Do NOT shop there.  You'll do better else where.</review>

<review>My family and I have bought 3 cars from Bill Brandt Ford since 1998. A Mustang, an Escape, and a Fusion. My parents bought the first 2 cars, so when it came time for me to purchase my first car on my own, I knew they would do everything they could to help me.

I'm telling you, there is no other dealership out there like BBF. It is a family owned business so they have long-standing, great values when it comes to serving the community, especially with this changing economy.  I especially appreciate how, Art, the man I worked with, didn't pressure me at all and was completely transparent with me on the details. Carlo, the person who helped me with the financial paperwork, took time to answer all my silly first time buyer questions and made me feel really comfortable. As a woman, buying a car can be.... .an experience, to say the least, but I experienced no issues here,

Lastly, I tried to buy from a different Ford dealer when I moved out of county, but it was a horrible mistake. They were awful and actually damaged my transmission. I'd rather drive 50 miles to BBF to be treated well and know I can trust the gentlemen working on my car.< /review>< Rate>

I brought my f150 in to have plugs put in. They gave me a 100+ point inspection. It said my tires were now 35psi. All around. For personal reasons I had put my tires up to 45psi, (they are rsted to 50psi), before I brought it in. So, now I have to raise tire presure. I get out compressor and check my tires and they were 45psi. That means that they not only didn't reset the pressure,  they didn't even check them. How much other stuff did they say they did and not do. I never had a problem with them before. But now I question there integrity.  I feel uncomfortable bringing it back to them. I've had some expensive repairs done before without any problems. I trusted them. Now they just lied about this and I'm on the fence about them. My name is Kris Mikulas.  Ford can contact me at any time. They have my info in computer.<//text>

<Text>Took my Ford Explorer there for the first oil change. It wasn't the nicest looking greeting area or waiting room but they did get me checked in relatively quickly and the oil change took about 40 mins. Which is not horrible. I asked for any coupons or specials since this was my first time going there to get my car serviced.   They said there was no specials at this time.  In thinking that since this is my first oil change, you would think that offering some kind of discount to keep me coming back for the life of the car would go along way.  I wasn't upset or disappointed but just thought, from a business stand point, that would go a long way to building a lifetime client.  I gave it 4 stars cause it wasn't bad, it just wasn't knock your socks off great customer service.</Text>< Pics>

This experience took way longer than it should have. We had all of our financing in order, but it still took 4 hours to complete. Our salesperson did the best he could, but it just took a long time.< /review>

Bill Brandt Ford rocks! Not just adequate, this dealership is exceptional! Above and beyond is the norm here. You think this review is bogus? Well I’m a quadriplegic and my wife and I have purchased our last two cars from them and couldn’t be happier 🙂 We wouldn’t think of going somewhere else.  Nice to be able to send my wife in to have her car serviced the right way knowing I don’t have to be there to make sure she’s not taken advantage of. If you What a great car buying experience give them a try you won’t be sorry. If you talk to Cory or Jason , Steve or Rocky,tell they Jeff and Alexis said hi they rock</Review>

<text>Bought my car at Bill Brandt Ford in July. Salesman, Colton, was wonderful. I felt he was honest and sincere and did his best to help me find just the car I wanted. He sent me a 6th month service reminder. When I took my car in for its first service, I found the staff to be friendly, helpful and efficient.  The service was fast and they told me about a couple of things that I would need to take care of in the future, but didn't push me to do anything unnecessary right now. I really felt they had my best interest in mind.
Thank you Bill Brandt Ford.</text></record>

We were very impressed with the service we received from Cory Hummel.  Cory followed up and answered all of our questions. Very professional, and courteous even delivered the car to our home . I will recommend him to my familyand friends.
we were in on 11/7/18 for a oil change we really appreciated the great effort your employee Lettecia gave us. she definitely traveled the extra mile to help us.< /review>

< Review>
I recently purchased a 2015 mustang through Juan a sales rep at this dealership. Prior to making my decision to purchase Juan was reasonably attentive and courteous. During the sale I was assured that I would be provided with the cars instruction manual which was missing. After the sale I recieved no courtesy followup, no manual and now I am finding that other factory provided items are missing. In addition I traded in a red 2007 mustang. I was low balled on my trade because the vehicle had been involved in multiple accidents. Now I am finding that the vehicle is being advertised by this dealer as being accident free and is being listed at high book value. The car fax shows one of the accidents. I realize that used cars are sold as "buyer beware" but this dealership takes that to an extreme.</Review>

Hector was solid, first time in history everything went down the way the car salesman stated it would.  That is why I drove an hour away Lasher is horrible.

Hector ty again for showing customer service like no other and letting my wife enjoy her car buying experience,

To the rest of the team out there thanks for everything.</Review>

They didnt seem very friendly. Eventually when I assume they realized that we were a black couple who was serious about buying a car they warmed up a little more. The buying process went very smooth and quick thanks to Fernando. Not much haggling over the price and terms. They pretty much catered to what we requested including a better rate and extended warranty and the paperwork was painless thanks to Chuck! So overall it was not a completely negative experience. We drove away in what seemed to be a reasonable purchase.< /Text>< pictures>

I decided to wait, but I didn't say until I got there.  So it was 4 hours for a 2 1/2 hour job, including the lunch hour of the mechanic.  Next time I will call myself a "waiter" when I make the appointment.</Text>

Been bringing my Fords to Bill Brandt service for 30 years and today was no different. Brought my Explorer in a day early so it could be looked at the following day. The tire pressure sensor was showing bad on the dash. Service tech, Daniel said it was a bit “light” today and he would try to get my car inspected this afternoon. It was and it was a faulty sensor. Ok’d the work and got a call 1 hour later telling me the car was finished. Picked up 30 minutes later and all working fine. It’s been 30 years of this type of service< /text>

DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP!

I recently had the displeasure of doing business with this dealership. My salesman was OK. Not real personable, but not rude.

The reason for 1 star is as follows:

I informed them up front that I already my financing in place. They then proceeded to "shop" my loan around without my permission or knowledge. They ran it through 6 other companies. I only know that because as they were doing it, Experian was emailing me. When I confronted my salesman with it, he feigned stupidity concerning it, and said he would ask his boss about it. I never saw him again until he came with the patented 4 square piece of paper trying to upsell me and make me pay more than I should. He never mentioned the loan shopping, and I had to ask him about it again.

I also confronted the sales manager about shopping my loan, and he gave me 4 really stupid and obviously canned reasons why they did it. I got so upset, I actually walked out on them. I really could not believe that they were willing to lose a sale because of their dishonesty and lies. The staff there does not even look at you. they walk by like you do not even exist. Very rude overall.

They absolutely are thieves and liars!

DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP! They lowered my credit score by shopping my loan knowing I had already acquired one. I would rate them - 5 if I could.< /Text>

<text>my mother who is 67 took her car to Bill Brandt ford for an oil change and check up they proceeded to tell my mom that her brake lights were out and that it was an electrical issue but that they had no one that that could fix it and they never offered any help so i took my moms car to monkey wrenches across the street and they simply changed the light bulbs and all was fixed. they showed me the bulbs and one had exploded and the other was burned out so i confronted the people at Bill Brandt and they told me they replaced the light bulbs and it still didn't work then i showed them the exploded light bulbs and they did not know what to say other than they were sorry my mom had to pay monkey wrenches $60 in labor to fix a 2 dollar item so i demanded that Bill Brandt refund my mom the $60 which they did but we will never go back to Bill Brandt ford again!!<//text>< pics>

< Review>
Called BILLBRANDT  for repair. There were no appointments for four days. I ended dropping off my tuck just so it was there and they ended up getting my truck in next day. Another mechanic/shop quoted me $2700 for rear end repair and the mechanics at BILLBRANDT  diagnosed and found exactly what was wrong and only ended costing me $200 in the end. Thanks BBF. If you call for repair ask for David he’ll take care of you.<//Review>

< Review>
Terrible service! We took our Ford Fusion to repair a window and a door handle, they told us to come back because they had to order parts. We cam back at the day and time they told us.....and guess what... they never ordered the part nor did they have our information!! They claimed they would have the part by end of day and we could pick up the car the next day. We left the car and not only did they not repair the car...they still had not ordered the part!!  They said to come back in 3 days and they still have not called us!!! It is just a window!!

We are about to purchase a new Explorer and I would never buy from them now, even though we have purchased en Expedition from them in the past!
Very disappointed!< /Review>

If your a out of state buyer please don't waste your time this guys only care about selling a car to someone who's there. They made me fill out a credit application and that was the last I heard of them. I called Fernando two days straight asking if I was approved or not he kept sayin he's sales manger was trying to get me approved not once did they ever call me back about my application. Finally on the 3rd day I called them again of course and Fernando said that I was not approved and that the car sold the previous day. YEAH OK ! pls look some where else this guys only care about the $$ in front of them<//text>

I came out in Oct was pleased with customer service and attentiveness...   I had a pre-approved loan from my bank(check in hand).  Willing to make a deal but needed to discuss with my wife if the vehicle would fit our needs...   I was asked to fill out paper work but assured my credit wouldn't be run again since I had my check from my bank... I ran my credit report because my score dipped below 800; the first time in years. ...  Bill Brandt Ford Motor Company ran a credit inquiry...   Disappointed in this type of customer service and the lack of integrity...< /review>

If you are a woman and do not know much about car dealerships. Do not come here alone. They add things in without your knowledge and tell you it comes with your monthly. I had no idea they added in a 5 year warranty, maintenance and gap insurance. My brother in law had to go back down there and ask about it. They claimed I read and signed a paper for it, which I didn't. They couldn't find the paper they swear I signed and was still telling me I signed it. Plus they kept going on and on about how bad my credit was and how if my grandma didn't cosign I wouldn't be getting a car. The sales manager Numan Ilayan was really rude and kept telling me I shouldn't have come alone and should have brought my brother in law there in the first place so they wouldn't have to redo the paperwork. At one point I said I wanted to return the car since I had not signed the loan agreement yet and he said "you can't just return a car" we said we hadn't signed yet and then he said "well I just want to see you leave with this car today". I will never come back here.<//Text>

Thats how i came across bill brandts page and noticed a mustang that i fell for immediatly. Went to the dealer  on my day off which was a 40 mile drive out and meet ryan who showed me the car inside and out. Ryan was a great rep and was very patient as i test drove and contemplated to actually run some numbers, for this would be a first time car purchase for me!. Ryan took us in and filled an app with the team, and at first i wasnt being approved with my original down payment. After an hr or so of finding the right numbers, and filling in the right information the sales team was able to give me an AMAZING deal, i cant stress how much the change was from first not being approved to getting such an amazing interest rate and payment and it was thanks to everyone at Bill Brandt. Do your research, know how much you can put down and everyone at bill brandt will exceed expectations and get you in the car you been eyeing!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Ford told me for a service ( oil change ) i Would have to drop off my truck in the morning and pick it up at the end of the day. Really!?         Pretty much take's the "quick" out of the "quick lane" don't it??</Review>

The most awful experience, truck was sold already after I called, shady salespeople,  take your money elsewhere where they want your business because I came with 25k cash in hand and left because of how salespeople treated me, got a new (only 6 miles) 2019 ram for 22k out the door in Gilroy instead but really wanted my blue oval insted.< /text>

< review>
My wife and I live 1,300 miles away from this dealer. We do not buy cars often (4 cars in 20 years). After searching for a used 2017 Mustang convertible nationwide (assisted by USAA online car buying service), we engaged Bill Brandt Ford because the car we wanted was available from them at a great price.

During our pre-sale engagement, our salesman was Corey. He was patient, courteous, responsive and attentive to our every inquiry along the way. As we progressed in the pre-sales, he even acted upon our request for a remote, front-to-back tour of the vehicle via FaceTime so that we could see the car without being there in-person. He really seems to like his work and he is really good at it.

We flew 1,400 miles to Sacramento and then drove the hour to Brentwood to purchase our vehicle at 9AM on a Saturday morning. When we arrived and looked at the car, we found it to be just as it was represented over FaceTime, via CarFax, and via our conversations with the dealer. Corey was true, forthright, and trustworthy in his dealings with us.

We enjoyed the entire pre-sales and signing experience. The closing paperwork was completed quickly (it took only about 15 minutes after waiting for about 30 minutes for the documentation to be prepared) and was a pleasant experience.

We learned during closing that Bill Brandt Ford is a family-owned (not corporate-owned) dealership unlike a majority of Ford dealerships in California. The difference is palpable.

We are delighted with our purchase. We drove home (two-day drive) in our new vehicle, with no regrets and no buyer's remorse...fully delighted. Enjoying our Mustang!

We would definitely recommend Bill Brandt Ford to anyone, wherever they live, based upon our great buying experience. No regrets.<//review>

<Text>These guys are shifty. I bought a 2013 Ford focus hatchback from these guys. These cars have Bad automatic clutches and a recall on them not to mention a class action lawsuit against Ford over the issue. I have a full repair extended warranty with Bill Brandt on this vehicle. I went into Bill Brandt Ford 3 times now. First two times they gave me a rental car with no questions asked and fixed the clutch. Third time I came in they told me they couldn't give me a rental car over this issue and took the car in a gave it back claiming there aren't any issues with the clutch. It's funny that they claim that now and my car's clutch is still messed up right now. I'm going to have to get a lawyer, they're trying not to Honor my warranty and get out of another lawsuit over the Lemon they sold me.<//Text><gmapID>0x808ffeea09ad5045:0x3506cbcb5138aaff< /gmapID>< Time>

I found a coupon online for an Oil Change for $39.99. It’s a competitive price, so I couldn’t complain, but then I seen everything that they do besides changing the oil, which includes:

THE WORKS® $39.95 OR LESS*
• Synthetic Blend Oil Change
• Tire Rotation and Pressure Check
• Brake Inspection
• Vehicle Check-Up
• Fluid Top-Off
• Battery Test
• Filter Check
• Belts and Hoses Check

So, that piqued my interest, and called to inquire. Dino answered very pleasantly and professionally, confirmed the package deal, kindly asked if I wanted to schedule an appointment, and his tone and pleasantry convinced me to give them a try, so I made the appointment. (First impressions always win with me!).

I get to my appointment, and they greet me as I get out of my car, one Rep greets me and opens the door for me with a smile and tells me where to go. (2nd impression (in-person) of the staff and process was highly appreciated. Daniel pleasantly and professionally greets me, and has my paperwork ready that Dino prepared prior to my arrival, checked me in, asked for my keys, and explained that it would be about an hour and that they’d call upon completion. I was in and out of there in literally 3 minutes. They didn’t rush me, they didn’t ignore me, they didn’t tell me to have a seat and wait until they got their lives together, etc., they calmly and kindly moved me right along through their process. The energy was positive, and anyone that came in or out greeted me with kind friendliness. GOTTA LOVE THAT! It’s the old school professionalism that I appreciate so much, especially since it’s hard to find these days with employees in various places acting like they’re being inconvenienced just to do their jobs, and God forbid they have to put their cell phones down for 2.2 nano seconds while they check their FB notifications as you stand there waiting to pay for a service with your hard earned money. You know the ones right?! Okay, moving on, lol. (3 Impression - Process ... smooth and swift, *****!)

Dino called me about an hour later and told me that my car was ready. I took a bit longer than I said I would to get there, but they seemed unbothered, and when I apologized, they said it wasn’t a problem. My paperwork was ready, I paid for the agreed service, and said my keys were in the car. That took like 5 minutes. They didn’t even forget to put the sticker in my window so I know when to get the next change! Last Impression? Perfect experience! I will be a return customer!! My Fiancé as well!</text>

Let us know if it gets worse!” Seriously??? And for over 2 years Ford has had RECALL on my 2013 Mustang -AIRBAGS! Ford keeps sending me notices: “call ur dealer bcs Ford cares about u”. BS. It’s all PR spin. I have told the dealer 3 times about it. I’m told “oh yeah we can’t fix it bcs we don’t have replacements”. BS. The car isn’t safe!< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

Neighborly kindness, no pressure attitude and no haggling, that’s
Bill Brandt Ford.
I showed up to “window shop” was approached by Mike Strokan a salesman whom I told that I was just there to look. He asked three questions, gave me his card and said he’d be there to answer questions if I had any then he left me along to browse.
“That was Awesome!”
I had been to several other dealerships and was constantly being bothered seemed like I was being Pressured right from the introductory.
Not at Bill Brandt Ford. When I seen what I wanted ...I actually approached the salesman not the other way around.
Mike and I talked shop and I said I’d need to think things over. Mike’s reply of “there’s no pressure, I’ve given you my card just let me know when your ready”
That there is what sealed the deal and took me back to Bill Brandt Ford where I purschased my 2017 Fusion.
I’d recommend them to anyone..from the salesman’s first approach to the creditor and finance officer they all greeted you with a smile, a handshake and some how made you feel as if you’ve known the your entire life. They worked with me until I had the right plan for my budget.
A great big “Thank You” from Virginia

< review>
Had a great experience with our lease three years ago and Brandy in their Leasing Department was super excited initially to get our Ford Escape back in their lot and to get us into a new vehicle. I finally returned her many many calls when we were ready to look at our lease renewal options about 3 months prior to our lease end and she suddenly couldn't be bothered with returning emails that we sent to her repeatedly. I expressed my concern with her lack of communication and she responded saying she wanted to win back our business. Apparently not really because after more emails that were not responded to by her or Jason Campos in internet sales, we took our business elsewhere and not only that, we dumped the Ford brand because of their complete mishandling. Also Ford's incentives for brand loyalty for staying with a Ford vehicle are dismal (only $1000). Chevrolet's incentive to switch brands is almost $2000. Seems the dealer incentive for brand loyalty should be higher or there is really no benefit in staying with the same brand.<//review>

A superior car buying experience...

Checked inventory ahead of time and found car I wanted and researched a price.  I met the excellent salesperson, Jeff Beller, and told him what I was interested in and what my budget was.  He told me it was very possible, then he  pulled through!  I got the car I wanted and a great deal!  If the car is as good as the service, I'll be stoked!!

Thanks again Jeff Beller and the BBF crew!  You guys rock!

Watch them, I utimately bought the car.  However they tried to slip in $5,000 of extras not agreed to. That would have an extra $100 per month. I came very close to just walking out.  After that frustration I did get the car for the advertised price.<//Review>

<text>Bought a new 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid. Colt and Steve bargained like true car salesmen but I managed to squeek out a few bucks from the bottom line on this high demand vehicle. Very friendly guys, no pressure, just "it is what it is".  We were pre-approved from our credit union for a loan but Steve found us a lower rate which saves us some money. After the sale, Colt spent a lot of time with us going over the operation of this high tech vehicle. As happy as can be with the sales process. No screwing going on here!< /text>< pictures>

Poor poor customer service!!! I only want to give them half of a star but wont allow me. We will not come back to purchased another vehicle from them at all. They put our address wrong and they want me to go to DMV and  take care of it, went to DMV and try to take care of it and DMV told me to go back where we purchased the vehicle and they have to  take care of it, that they cant help me. Call the dealership back and they still wont help us,  i went back and forth between them and dmv, it was a hassle, we paid cash for the vehicle and this is what we got. Please read all reviews first before buying anything from this Dealership!!<//Text>

I went to Yelp to read reviews for Bill Brandt Ford before continuing to attempt to do business with them. I ignored the bad reviews because I trusted the internet sales manager I was speaking with. The internet sales manager had two days off and his assistant contacted me notifying me of a price drop, I called her immediately and asked her THREE different times over the phone "Are you sure this is the 4WD one?" She responded "Let me check" then confirmed that the price drop was for the 4WD over the phone and that it was $13,037. I was so excited to continue business with them after hearing this price drop for the 4WD vehicle that I wanted and have been looking for...come to find out, they sent me the SAME exact 2016 White Jeep Patriot with a price drop only it was FWD... which is why over the phone I asked Brandy 3 different times to confirm it was the 4WD and as mentioned above she said yes. I got an email the next day saying the best price they could do would be $14,638. After talking to the Sales Manager Newman he tried to twist Brandy's words and said that she was confirming the price drop of the 4WD from $14,839 to $14,639, I was the one on the phone, not him and they are LYING. This is yet again, another SHADY car dealership. There was confusion and a mistake, but not my mistake, their mistake and they are refusing to honor the price Brandy told me over the phone. Would NOT recommend doing business with them unless they are going to honor their words and their own mistakes.<//Text>

<text>This service dept does not care about Ford customers!!  We are seniors with only one car, and are about 7 miles from the dealer. It is making a strange noise, so we stopped in on Monday to make an appointment, and were told there were no appointment times open for 2 weeks!!!  I asked for any referrals to local shops and was told, none.  We cannot ignore this problem for 2 weeks.  I already figured we would be forced to rent a car in the meantime.
No, sorry I wish we could help, and certainly no interest in my problem at all.  Just a see ya!< /text><date>1499211419911</date>< Response>
