This location is very convenient! All their employees are very, very attentive. Except for the pharmacy staff.

I was there today and noticed a brand new stand for makeup! Their collection is growing. Which is great for their costumers. Great variety at a very affordable price.

This is also the best place to come and purchase bday cards they have a huge selection.

One thing they can improve on is their maintenance. They need to keep the bums out of their store. Every time, I come here there’s always a homeless person asking for money.<//text>

<text>DO NOT PRINT PICTURES HERE. Worst customer service in a long time. Guy at the counter was extremely disrespectful.

When he arrived at the photo counter we told them we were here for pick up. His response in a degrading way; pick up what... throughout the whole thing his demeanor stayed the same and we actually found out the pictures were not printed and he was not going to, for some weird reason.

Absolutely the last time we will use Walgreens photo service generally. Seriously; who hires someone like that?!?</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf519b1ce6f1:0x790f25c16e221a39</Gmap_id></record>

I went to pick up my fedex package today. The lady in the photo section not only took her sweet time with some photo envelope. She could’ve easily stop what she was doing to assist me. She was not only rude to me the whole time but to other people who came to her for help. I honestly don’t know who can that lady work there if she’s not willing to help anyone and has such an attitude.< /Text>

I have tried to give the pharmacy here the benefit of the doubt for years. But they just can’t seem to get it right. Nearly every time I fill prescriptions they make a mistake — they insist my insurance won’t cover something when it will, I get a text saying something is ready to be picked up and then go in they say they put it back already. I’ve gotten wise enough to call and ensure the lengthy wait times just so I don’t leave my house and have to deal with the frustration of ultimate trips and tonight was no different — I called them and they said something would be filled in an hour and then two hours later I checked the online status and it said it wasn’t in stock. I called and the same guy who said it would be ready in an hour said “oh yea I was going to call you about that, it’s actually pretty common for that to not be in stock.” Why not tell me that originally? Also the fact that he said they were going to call is a joke. In four years of going to this pharmacy they have never called with an issue — it’s always a surprise I have to deal with on site or check the site or call. It’s like I have to be a detective to figure out if I can get my medications filled. And now more than ever when people are supposed to limit their outings you’d think they would step up the communication so people are taking unneeded trips out. But nope. The only thing reliable about the pharmacy is their unreliability. It was a running joke with my friends how bad this place was.

I’ll be switching to Rite Aid.</Text>

I purchased a gift card on 12/24/2019, then when the recipient tried to use it it was empty. I called various times and visited the store 3 times until I was able to speak to the manager who started the claim over the phone since he said he could not give me a refund so the only way was to start the claim. The claim was submitted on 1/2/2020 and was told it should take approximately 7-10 business days to resolve and that I would receive a phone call. I was never contacted via phone just an email apologizing that my issue is not resolved yet. Today is 2/20/20 It has been almost 2 months already and all I get is email responses that they apologize that my issue is not resolved. No explanation, no update or anything and when I tried to call in to follow up the first time they said it was taking long because they were "waiting for a response from the person in charge of those issues". TWO MONTHS really? Then when I tried calling weeks after that all they said was that I had to wait for them to contact me. What exactly am I waiting for? Every time they email me back its just to tell me "sorry it is taking so long". I paid cash on 12/24/2019 for goods that I still have not received. If it is so hard to resolve the issue then why can't you just GIVE ME A REFUND?? Absolutely ridiculous. WORST customer service experience ever.</review>

This is the WORST Walgreens in Los Angeles that I know of. The Cashiers do TRY to give good customer service but MANAGEMENT HINDERS their efforts. It always STINKS inside and out and it looks like they could use a GOOD cleaning Crew !  The Air Conditioner NEVER works during the summer months and the Chocolate Candy MELTS but they still LEAVE them on the SHELVES !!!!! This Walgreens is a HEALTH HAZARD and I'm REPORTING them ASAP !< /text>

<review>This is honestly the worst Walgreens I have ever been to. The pharmacy is constantly out of my meds. Every single time I refill, they can't fill it because they need to order more. I get the same thing consistently once a month, and they never have my scrip. A few times I've needed to pick up my meds before going out of town, and I've had to go to a different location because they won't get it in before I leave.
Then they'll send notices that my prescription is ready for pickup, but when I get there they give me a partial fill and tell me I'll have to come back when they get the rest. This is after waiting in line forever...every time.
I've been coming here because it's the closest to my home but I'll gladly drive in traffic to another location to never have to deal with this place again.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf519b1ce6f1:0x790f25c16e221a39< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT GET VACCINATIONS AT WALGREENS!

So, last week I found that I could make online appointments for vaccinations at Walgreens (for the Philippines trip). I did all of the online stuff, then called our local store, talked to a pharmacist to check prices and availability and confirmed the appointment.

We went in today, exactly on time for the appointment, and the girl at the window told us we didn't need an appointment and that she'd be happy to take care of my shots. All she needed was my list of what we needed.

I had left that at home, because in making the appointment, I told online Walgreens exactly what I needed.

We sat for 20 minutes while the girl took a quick course on computer use, then applied her knowledge to find the information about my appointment on the magical glowing box near the register.  Smiling, she finally could take care of me... or not.

Predictably, they had nothing that I needed except tetanus boosters. She said that typhoid vaccine was nonexistent, and she'd have to order the others and that it would be weeks before I could get my shots.

That was when I stormed out rather than scream at the poor girl and inspire someone to call the cops.

When I got home, I found a nearby clinic that could give me all the shots I needed--including the supposedly nonexistent typhoid shot--right away.  It costs a bit more, but I'll gladly pay to avoid the headache of ever having to step into this crappy Walgreens again.</Text>

As others have reported this location reeks of human waste, inside & out. Asking for help finding an item is a true test of your patience because the employee's work mode only fluctuates between annoyed & bewildered. That's all they know. If you should find yourself in the unenviable position where you must ask for assistance, get a second opinion from a different employee. In my experience the first employee is ALWAYS wrong. Avoid whenever possible.</Review>

Good store since I moved over in the area. They greet you with a smile and they pay attention to there customers when they are asking then a question about a product. I like this store because theyare friendly and the pharmacy remembers there patients faces and names when they come in.  2 tomes</Text>

<Review>While I love the Walgreens at Sunset And Vine, I cannot say the same for this location. The parking lot often smells of urine. It reeks so bad at times that I find myself holding my breath from my car to the store. Once in the store things don't get too much better.  The air might be breathable but it looks as if someone went up and down the aisles and just threw things back on the shelves with no regard to where they actually should go. This location always seems to be short staffed as well which could explain why things are just thrown back on shelves in a willy nilly manner. This store stands in stark contrast to the wonderful Walgreens at Sunset and Vine. If you have the means, go to that location instead.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
The management here decides to use brutal extermination methods for innocent young birds. Trapping them in nets and allowing them to die a slow painful death. They along with Western extermination need to boycotted for their barbaric actions!</Review>

<Review>Stopped here to get something but didn't take enough money in. Item was $1.49 and total was $1.63. Gave the cashier 6 quarters, $1.50. When I returned with the 13 cents, said I only gave her $1.25. Argued but gave the extra quarter.
If this is a regular practice,  one could make a profit, provided 1000's of people need gas and other items daily.

Great place to get gas and usually one of the most affordable places in town.  Employees have always been helpful and friendly.  Only getting 4 stars because I don't like getting asked for money everytime I need gas. I wish I could help everyone but often I've scrounged just to pay for my  own gas!< /review>

<text>This place does not rate any stars. Came to fill up air in my tires and they refused. I have been here previously to top up air in my tires before. Definitely will not be coming back. The bigger cashier was extremely rude and had an attitude.< /text><userid>104213852664887902649<//userid><date>1550647541966< /date>< response>

This gas station is dangerous. On yale and Florida. Dont come at night or alone. People have been robbed multiple times in the shopping center the gas station is in. But besides that every single time we go there at night the person is ALWAYS ON BATHROOM BREAK. NEVER FAILS<//Text>

<text>I believe I was scammed out of my winnings on a Ca lottery scratcher.
When I returned about an hour later to ask for verification on the two winning tickets the employee and manager refused to allow me to make sure there wasn't a mistake made. They said it's against policy to allow a person to review the ticket if they believe a mistake is made.
Then they said they threw them away. And I could not retrieve them out of the trash.
If it was my reputation on the line and someone was calling me a cheat or thief I would get the ticket and prove them wrong or review the video tape and see if what they are saying has any merit at all BUT NO THAT DIDNT HAPPEN. I was simply told to leave and if I said anything negative publicly I'd be sued.
When the guy employee took my 2 winning tickets he took them to the back out of my view to "scan them".
He returned to the front with only 1  lottery receipt with my 2 tickets.
He put that receipt into the machine to pay me out. He then took one scratcher and ripped it then put the receipt from that transaction with it  and with the other winning scratcher.(which I thought was odd since he didn't rip that one in half either)
He never scans another receipt for the 2nd winning scratcher.
He tells me I won $35 and then hands me that cash from the register.
I was in a hurry because my bus was pulling up out front and left.
On my ride home I thought about the whole transaction and started to realize that maybe I had been wronged.
I recall that on the ticket he scanned a (1274) $5 California Black Premium I had matched 6 winning prizes each for $5 to the winning numbers.
That totals $30!!!
I then remembered that on the scratcher I believe he didnt scan I forgot to scratch off the multiplier and $20 bonus box.
It was a (1270) $3 5X Crossword bonus match.
I recall counting 5 words completely scratched off(which is $10 for 5 words) but was so excited I had won and was in a hurry because my bus is to be there any minute I rushed back into  the gas mart to redeem my winning tickets.
Now if you do the math that's at the very minimum $40 not $35.
but it could be more since I still do not know what the multiplier was nor if I had won the $20 bonus box or if I had miscounted and had more words than I thought I did.

So this is why I'm giving a bad review and that I will no longer do business there!
My friends will no longer go there. My family will no longer go there.

and I will continue to give a negative reviews on all applicable sites that any consumer might look at until I'm  proved wrong (at which  will go back to every review and will apologize and state that I was wrong)<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Bevmo has a huge selection off alcohol and mixers. The staff is always helpful and they try and order new beers to keep up the variety. The point off is because they are always a bit more pricey than other stores, it's especially hard here since Costco is right across the street.< /review>< GmapID>

Pretty good spirit selection.  They always have a few wines at "buy 1 bottle get the 2nd for 5 cents",  so if any of those are appealing, the price is good.< /Review>

I like to stop in here sometimes for hard-to-find foreign wines, or anything that I can't find locally. Their selection is strong, and the prices are reasonable on most vintages.<//review>

Such a better selection than Keg N Bottle. If you're looking for good beer from around the world come here. I wanted some domestic beer (Sam Adams Winter Lager) and Albertsons had it for $11.49 for a six pack, where BevMo had it for $6.99 (sale price)< /Review>

Just went there today and was immediately reminded Bevmo still has the most Expensive booze in town...especially with Costco and Albertsons within the same shopping complex. Bevmo's logistics department must suck!!!! As I'm walking into Costco or Albertsons, I look across the parking lot and just laugh.<//Review>

Folks thought BevMo would ruin San Roque, but in my experience, it's just meh.  Much better prices at TJ or Costco.  It's great for selection, but I guess I have simple tastes.</Text>

Nice, friendly store. Great surprise deals but it doesn't have consistent prices or goods so it's a little lucky when you find the right thing.</text>

I love this store! I choose to go here over any other grocery store in Quincy. Every other store seems to have prices way out of my price range and when we head up to the family cabin we would love to shop locally.  This store makes it happen and we can help to support our home away from home.  It may not have the exact brand that you're looking for but I never leave without everything on my entire list and cart full.< /Text>

I didn't realize it hat every store has different prices for same items and that something you get there one week might not be there the next week and the price they charge you for a bag is ridiculous.</text>

Prices are, in general,  good. But, certain products are inconsistent. An eclectic inventory indeed. I wish all Grocery Outlets were like the Grass Valley store.<//review>

I saw the dairy truck there yesterday??
Usually wouldnt care but its THE ONLY thing i went for.

Milk. Eggs... Butter etc is more expensive than sav more.

After checking over 1000 prices. I really didnt see any low prices comparatively.

If your a man that likes PRETTY GIRLS at the checkout.....
Just go to SAV MORE or Safeway.
Doesnt look loke ur gonna save much money.

Great processed organic selection. Great for items you may only want to eat once.<//Text>< Pictures>

<user_id>112390254389954065998<//user_id><Review>I got hand therapy here. Therapists work with up to 6 patients at a time. They set timers for each modality and only do it/have you do it the minimum time they're allowed for reimbursement (i.e. if one unit manual therapy is 8-15 minutes, that timer is going to be set for 8 minutes and at the end of 8 minutes they will stop). Therapists were sweet but obviously inexperienced and not knowledgeable. The therapy was not helpful and thus I ended up needing surgery. Do not recommend.</Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< gmapID>

Went to Matthew Beaty at Selection Physical Therapy, because of back issues, he was very thorough in treating my back, showing me exercises to do and what I needed to do to get back to feeling better.  He is professional, courteous, and very detailed in his assessment of your injury and what needs to be done to get you back to feeling 100%.</text>

Taney Chau, PT is excellent, he's helped me regain movement of my shoulders and gives me a lot of various exercises to complete at home, which have been helping me a ton. I am now off medication and have minimal to no pain, his assistant Trey is also excellent, very helpful and attentive as well as Ashton who challenges me with new exercises all the time. Thank you all so very much!!! I was a mess when I got here but 💪🏾is happening!</text>

I’ve been going to Select Physical Therapy on and off since 2006 due to various injuries from sports and surgeries. Each time I’ve had to go, I have always had exceptional Physical Therapists (Julie, Ben, and Greg) that truly create an individualized rehab regimen structured just for me. The facility has been remodeled a few times, but it is definitely state of the art and very clean. I’ve had Greg as my PT since November 2018 to help rehab a knee injury I acquired during a soccer game. Most recently, this past May, I’ve had ACL repair and microfracture surgery to fix my knee. I’m happy to have Greg as my PT during this recovery because I trust him wholeheartedly and know he will create a plan that is right for me. I know these next several months will be grueling, but I’m confident that with the help from Greg I’ll be back to sport and being active again soon!< /text>

<review>Aram the therapist assigned to my case was great!  Quiet, smart and knows his stuff!   The facility is very capable and they have a lot of modern rehab machines, etc..I’ve done quite a bit of physical therapy in my past and this place was my favorite.    Unfortunately, my condition didn’t resolve itself  in the 12 visits of physical therapy sessions.  However, It was not for lack of trying.  The reality is  I most likely need surgery.  Good place!  I will go to them the next time I need PT.   I recommend Aram and the facility highly!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>This place has been great, all due to the friendly staff.  They are very accommodating, at least with my Occupational Therapy appointments.  The parking is ample whether you park at their lot or at Howard Hughes. They are able to change my appointments whenever I needed without attitude or waiting too long.
I really appreciate the helpfulness, friendliness and knowledge that Wendy possesses.  She is the best and her aides, too.  They are funny and make you feel at ease.

<review>After having knee surgery last December, my surgeon recommended PT. I have been going to Select PT for several sessions and am truly happy with the results. The therapist, Reema, is friendly and very professional. Every day, she has my schedule prepared with the progressive exercises I am supposed to do and she works with me when it is necessary. My knee is improving and I look forward to my sessions. The facility has great equipment and the whole staff is very attentive to the needs of the patients. If you need PT, I highly recommend Select PT</review>< Name>

I am receiving OT Services from Evelyn at Select Physical Therapy, and because of her exceptional OT skills, I am making a remarkable recovery from my broken wrist. I would highly recommend Evelyn, because, not only is she intelligent and very knowledgeable of what is required to diagnose the problem before her, but she is extremely engaged in each and everyone of her clients which makes them feel valued as an individual, and not just as a client. That is a rare quality, and that is what sets her apart.< /Text>

<review>This is my 3rd time doing PT at Select. Each experience has been very positive. The therapist were up on all the latest rehabilitation techniques and assistants were competent. More importantly I was able to achieve my goal of full recovery and return to the activities I enjoyed prior to injuries.</review><rate>5</rate><GmapID>0x80c2b0b2d1955b9f:0x4e2f99f87419d07c</GmapID><Time>1552255349834<//Time><user>109162338578249146592</user><username>David Bowdre</username>< pictures>

< Review>
I have been receiving physical therapy with Select Physical Therapy. They are very passionate with their work. Their goal is to make sure that the client get back to being 100%  healed. I always receive 100% attention during my scheduled visits. No time is ever waisted. I've noticed that the staff members work together as a team. If you're ever in need of physical therapy, I definitely recommend that you go to Select Physical Therapy.

See Matt Beatty. I'm not sure what the last names of Brad and Oscar are but I can assure you that they are AWESOME!!!<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I have had two separate knee surgeries within five months of each other and the therapist that has and still is working with me on my recovery is Don R. Don is someone I have come to know as professional, hard working, informative and extremely knowledgeable in the world of physical therapy. He has literally helped me get back on my feet and although the recovery of my second surgery has been difficult, it is finally at a point where full or almost full recovery is in my immediate future. Thank you Don!

I also want to thank Don’s assistants Maddy and Breanna...</review>< GmapID>

While Select is the Physical Therapy place of choice for many collegiate and professional athletes, it's tough to recommend it for regular people.

At most physical therapy places, you work with a physical therapist at a maximum 2:1 patient to PT ratio. It's reasonable to have a physical therapist work with two people at the same time. At Select, after a thorough first meeting with "your" PT, you'll realize that you're splitting time with "your" PT with four or five other patients at the same time.

Because I am fine working independently, it didn't bother me much, but it's certainly not for everyone. It's hard to ignore tall of the discouraged faces that are bummed out from not getting the 1:1 attention that they thought they signed up for.

If you want to be left alone and do some reps and stuff on your own time, Select is worth a look. If you want 1:1 attention, this is not your spot.< /review>

Today was the worse day so far coming to this restaurant!!  I heard from friends the food was good.  I was hesitant at first because it looks so dirty outside.  Because their own were eating here I figured it's good.  It's always busy.

The food is good with the exception of the sweet and sour pork.  The parts that have most of the batter are pork fat underneath.  The parts that look thicker are the same batter fried too much.  The rest of the food I have to say is pretty good.  Today I ordered 3 items and they gave me the nasty sweet and sour pork I don't like instead of my pork fried rice.

The worst part is I was told there would be a 30 minute wait that turned out to be an hour and twenty minutes.  We should at least be told the truth so we can decide if we want to go somewhere else.  It makes me sad to not come back but at this point it's not really worth going to.  Don't believe when they say thirty minutes because it is NEVER 30 minutes!!<//Text>

Tiny hole in the wall spot on Mission. you could probably drive by it and not even notice. Definitely seems like a family-run operation.

Although small their menu is pretty extensive. came here on a Friday night and luckily we came at the time we did. After we sat down it seemed like a rush of people came and the entire restaurant was full.

We ordered four dishes. One of my absolute favorite dishes, hung tao yee fu wonton, was fantastic! The combination of crispy wontons and flavorful soup was perfect. Definitely something you should order. Next up was salt and pepper porkchops. Nicely fried and very crispy. We got two vegetable dishes. The eggplant was very good. We also got pea sprouts. Unfortunately I didn't eat them because I was way too full, but my parents said they were good!

Although this is a small restaurant, this place provides huge portions for what they charge. I suggest coming early so you don't have to wait.</Review>

<Review>My favorite Chinese food in the neighborhood, not only is it authentic but portions are huge! I usually order beef and tofu and shrimp scramble with a side of rice, comes out to $22.30. The owner is also very nice and remembers your order. I highly recommended this restaurant.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

You will wait a long time. You can't expect fancy service or decor.

It's outstanding, homestyle chinese, at a low price. The wontons and eggrolls, even spring rolls are freshly homemade and it shows. They feature fried smelts, and various classics. The chinese broccoli and greens are flavorful and never overcooked.  The food is made to order. The quality and portions are generous.

It confuses me when people complain about decor and service in a place that is obviously just a takeout - and a very busy one at that because of it's loyal following. Get the food here. You won't be dissapointed.</Text>

They'll even turn away customers that want to order to go as they are already backed up in orders for dine in/to go. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait for our food but the owner is super nice and my family and I don't mind as when the food does come out, its always delish and we are often not waiting inbetween courses.

Their beef dishes are all really good and Looks like their fried fish and chicken wings are popular as well.

Come here earlier or after the lunch/dinner rushes to snag a table or call ahead to order to go!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Delicious......

Ms. Lee Always takes care of you.

Today I will Talk About The (🍋 Lemon Chicken with Fried Rice).

The Lemon Chicken is lightly Sweetened,
With A a Light Crunch But Juicy Tender meat.

Then When You Take A Bite Of the Fried Rice
Youll look Down at it And See it's perfect Brown-ness with Light Saltiness of The Chinese BBQ PORK pieces.  And When you taste The Egg from the fried Rice You'll Look Down again at Your Food waiting to See where You'll Digg your Spoon Next.

The Experience With This Dish Is Amazing....
The Light Crunch, With The Perfect Flavoring,
The Fried Rice.

With Every tiny Hint Of Flavor, You'll Tease  Yourself With Small Bites.....And Wish You Can Eat All Of it.......     Heavenly Good.

Now Try it With SRIRACHA.......</Text>< pics>

<Text>After I drop my kids off at school and go for my morning walk I usually stop here to get work do. WiFi is a little slow and the place is a little small. Specifically when the high school kids come in for the lunch rush. But the staff here is amazing. Some days I bring my own drink in but they still check on me to make sure I am good. Great job guys!<//Text><Date>1583439616879<//Date>< Pictures>

The barristas here are fast and nice. BUT they don't know their own refill policy and the coffee here was even more bitter/burnt tasting than Starbucks usually is. This is also a small location better suited to grab and go, than studying or hanging with your girls. They made three out of our for drinks incorrectly</Text>

Between Panera and Coldstone.   The Starbucks app and website label this location as 'Roosevelt & Rosecrans' but it is in Liberty Station on Truxton Rd.  I understand there is another Starbucks inside Vons in the same plaza (I cannot confirm as I do not shop there).  This however, is a stand alone location and always has high traffic.  The staff is almost always wonderful, seem to know their local folks and are good about acknowledging regular faces.  It is tiny inside but there are 7-8 very small tables and a bar that will seat 2 comfortably.  About 4-5 outlets as far as I can tell.  I've been here a dozen times during my 3 month visit to the area and I have always managed to find a table with an outlet within a short time of arriving (if not immediately).<//text>

I did a mobile order here today and sent someone to get it for me. When they got back with it I started drinking it and all was just warm milk! I ordered a Grande Late and got warm milk! WTH?</text>

<Text>Very cozy and pleasant place. The baristas are friendly. And you actually have several A/C outlets for juicing up your electronics. Many Starbucks in the area do not.<//Text>< GmapID>

Agree with other reviews that it is pretty small. Not a great place to hang or stay. Otherwise similar to other locations pretty good service overall.<//text>

These baristas are awesome and work hard. Sundays are a bit challenging because there are lines after Sunday services but they always smile and literally move to get the orders out in a timely manner<//review>

The coffee always tastes burnt, which requires copious amounts of mitigating add-ons like cremes and sugars.  Which turns a coffee into a Sundae.  Blah.< /Text>

Coffee guy should call a petson's as opposed to what the person ordered. Otherwise why ask for a name. And speak up. My breakfast just sat there forever because he did not call out my name.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) If you like their coffee, that's OK. If necessary, you can drink it. As is well known, tastes are also different.

<review>Awesome service! Thank you Ryan and everyone at Clifton Mercedes for your professional service and attention. And thank you also for the license plate frames you kindly and courteously placed on my Mercedes. My GL 450 is looking fabulous!

<Text>I highly recommend Clifton Mercedes for your Mercedes service needs.  Ryan and team are awesome. They truly care about you and your car. Customer service is top notch. They have top qualified mechanics that can troubleshoot anything. They take the time to listen to issues you may be having with your car and address them. They don't up sell services or parts you don't need. I've been taking my car to them for several years and highly recommend you give them a try.  You won't want to go anywhere else.<//Text>< response>

At Clifton Mercedes your experience will foster a sense of confidence that you will value. Trust me, Ryan is like having you own concierge, making your car care needs as convenient as possible.
I have found value in this family owned business and do not second guess recommended service or repairs. But my inclination to favor this personal care is not enough for repeat patronage unless the repairs are done correctly; and they are!
If your Mercedes is older or brand new requiring factory authorize service, I highly recommend you stop by or call for your next service, Clifton will not disappoint.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1617905879913, 'text': 'Thanks for the kind words Robert!

Clifton came highly recommended by German Auto Repair and my son-in-law, and I have to say they were right in their praise!!! Ryan was uber-nice to work with and was fair in his estimate. The work was done quickly and to my satisfaction. I would recommend Clifton to anyone needing service to their car!!!< /Review>

<text>Absolutely the best place to go for servicing your Mercedes.

First, this is a family business. The son, Ryan, works the front desk while the dad, Mark, still turns wrenches in the shop. Talk about a true vested interest in your satisfaction!

We've taken our various Mercedes there for years for service.

Don't think you're missing out on something that the dealership offers because you're not.

A HIGHLY recommend!!!<//text>< user_id>

I purchased a new Mercedes Benz E400 and needed to get an oil change and filter. However, I was skeptical taking my vehicle to a Mercedes Benz Dealership. After hard research online I found Clifton Mercedes and took my car in for maintenance. Ryan was very professional and knowledgeable he assured me that everything used in the shop are OEM and follows the guidelines and standards for Mercedes Benz vehicles. The price was fair and I can’t complain! Fast turnaround and Ryan was even honest to let me know if I don’t plan on keeping the vehicle I won’t be due for another maintenance until 10,000k miles. However, if I am keeping the vehicle (which I do plan on) I should come in for Service A two more times (5,000k miles) before getting a service B which includes more maintenance on top of Service A. I plan to stick with Clifton Mercedes for all my maintenance for my vehicle. I will be a loyal long term customer there’s no doubt about that! If you need maintenance done for your Mercedes Benz you should check out this shop if you haven’t already! They are an independent experts on all Mercedes Vehicles.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My Mercedes has a common oil seepage issue. A dealer told me that it needed to be fixed at a cost of $,1900. I took my car to Clifton for a second opinion. Mark Clifton looked at it and said that it was common and rarely needed to be fixed. A year later I took my car to Clifton for the B service. The mechanic thought that the seepage was so minor that he was not going to mention it. I recommend Clifton for service and repair. They are honest. They do not try to upsell or tell you that you need something that you don't.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
We have been using Clifton Mercedes since1990. Technician Jim is super for locating a problem and making the appropriate repairs. Mark and Ryan have been so honest and helpful and I have never had reason to question their judgment. When I picked up my 2008 MB55 AMG I was delighted at how it ran like showroom new and looked as good. They use a fantastic detailed and I have it done yearly
I highly recommend Clifton and have referred them to several of my friends who have been happy with the service<//Review>

Paid $200 for a pre-purchase inspection here, I live 700 miles away. Ryan was very patient with me on the phone as I went through a list of my concerns, and solidified my decision. Thanks</review>

First time using this shop.  I was impressed with the whole experience.  When installing the shade, the technician damaged the window tint.  Ryan had the tint replace with an exact match the very next day.  I inquired about service cost and the quote was also much less than a dealer.  Very professional operation.< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

No need to go anywhere else!  Clifton is great on every aspect of auto repair.  They listen to your concerns, come up with a plan that works for you, and don't try to up sell you on doing work that is not needed. They make you feel like part of the family.   Prices are fair, work is completed in a timely manner and you always know what is going on, because Ryan will keep you informed.</Review>

Clifton has been our go to for Mercedes repair for many years. We have recommended them to friends several times. They are honest and have integrity - not always something easy to find when getting your car repaired. We are so thankful to have such a good repair shop where we know we will be treated fairly and with respect. Their pricing is totally reasonable and they do not try and jam you. We couldn’t be happier with their service and the work they have done on our cars. They are the best!<//Text>

<review>Clifton Mercedes restores my faith that reputable, fair and honest businesses still exist. Ryan at Clifton Mercedes went above the mark by getting a factory generated problem corrected on my Mercedes at no cost to me. You heard right. I was prepared to go deep in my wallet because the problem was not obvious and the solution was unknown. Ryan gave me a fair best case estimate before things got started so I thought I knew what to expect when my car was ready. The folks at Clifton Mercedes diagnosed that the problem was part of a recall fix and drove my car to the dealer to get fixed, same day no problem. What a surprise to get my car back from Clifton Mercedes the same day I dropped it off good as new, without spending a dime. Wow!<//review>< pictures>

When it comes to auto repairs, you are at the mercy of either the dealership service department or auto repair shop, especially when repairs can be astronomical. Best decision I ever made was to take referrals from two people to call Clifton Mercedes.  This is a family-owned and run business and most of my dealings have been with a Ryan Clifton, but I am pretty sure he has learned his amazing scruples from his dad Mark. Not only do they not recommend you do unnecessary service on your vehicle, quite unlike your normal dealership service department, but go beyond to call the dealership to make sure you still have a warranty on a repair that will be extremely costly, and even set up the pickup of your vehicle from the dealership. This is one amazing local business and I highly recommend and will continue to refer others.</review>

<Text>Mark Clifton and his son Ryan own and operate this terrific Mercedes independent sales and service business. Friendly, knowledgeable, competent and professional, Clifton Mercedes provides quality service and workmanship while being forthright and honest about what needs to be done. As most know, car repair work isn't a perfect science,  so you can trust Clifton to troubleshoot and "fix" problems right the first time and to guide you in the right direction for prioritizing repairs. They truly care about their service, work and treating the customer right! I highly recommend them above all others!< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1568991457686, 'text': 'Thank you Mark.

Ryan and Mark Clifton are the only guys I trust with our Mercedes cars. Ryan and Chuck have been taking of our Mercedes cars for over a decade and they are fair, honest and get our cars done quickly. I don't have to call them to see when the cars would be ready because they are excellent about keeping me informed about what needs to be done and typically  my cars are done the same day. Ryan and Mark go out of their way to help us when we have questions about our cars and there has never been a time that we can't bring our cars in the day we call which is very helpful with our busy schedules., We consider Mark and Ryan family and trust them 100%. We  recommend Clifton Mercedes to anyone who needs work done on their Mercedes and they are happy with the recommendation. Before someone recommended we use Clifton Mercedes, we went to San Diego Mercedes and they were much more expensive and I often felt like they thought they were doing me a favor by working on our cars and we had to make numerous calls to get an update on my cars and I often had to take the cars back because they were not working properly after the repair. There are no issues with the repair work from Clifton Mercedes - It is a ONE AND DONE! We never have to have the cars back after they have worked on our cars! Well done Clifton Mercedes!!<//review>

The best in the business.  They work on all my cars.  They are the only one I trust working on my 2012  Mercedes C63 Black Series.  Stop taking your car to the dealership, and bring it to Clifton Mercedes.  You will not be disappointed.   Family own and they will take care of your car as if it was their own.  You will also save so much more money going to Clifton for service then if you were to go to the dealership.</text>

Clifton Mercedes is a great place to take your vehicle for repair. Their work is done right the first time; no returning the car multiple times because the repair was not done right. The facility is clean. I'm almost afraid to walk on the floor due to its brightness. The staff and management are very friendly. You will not be disappointed with the service.<//Review>

I have been using Clifton Mercedes since 2007. I still use them today. They will never charge you or try and get you to do anything to your car that does not need to be done; unlike many other Mercedes facilities or official dealers; (Upsale). The same employees have worked there for years now which tells you its a great place to work and ethical. (no employee turnover).  Run by Ryan and his father Mark, I always know my questions will be answered truthfully and I have no concerns of what information I am receiving, unlike experiences I have had at other shops.
Use Clifton with confidence.</text>

We've been using Clifton Mercedes for years & every repair has been above and beyond.  Unlike other shops that price gouge, this family ran & owned business chooses integrity & fair pricing vs overcharging & under-delivering.  The parts/labor prices are significantly cheaper than the dealer/other independent shops, & they will actually let you know if a repair does not have to be done so it can save you money in this horrid economy.  Do yourself & your hard earned money a favor and give them a try, you will not be disappointed.<//Text>

Clifton Mercedes is by far the best! Honest. Professional. The crew is second to none. I don’t buy a car and find a mechanic. I buy a Mercedes so I can take it to Clifton!</Text>

I’ve been a customer of Clifton Mercedes since moving into the area a few years ago. These guys are the best! They’ve serviced both my 2007 SL550 and 2013 GL550!

Clean shop, comfortable waiting area, always friendly and most important, knowledgeable & honest!  If you’re looking for a dealer alternative for your Mercedes, you’d be hard pressed to do better than Clifton Mercedes!< /text>

<review>I was going to let it go, but its bothering me a lot, so I thought other people should know about this place, and how they mistreat their customers and not perform their agreed upon services, but rather take short cuts to save money.

I went in to get a simple battery replacement and recode done, as quoted to me on the phone for a specified price. Instead, what I received was a battery replacement with no recoding of the car's computer. Instead, they hooked up my car to a generator, while they were replacing the battery, so they would not have to run the codes after the replacement.
When I questioned why the recoding was not performed, that's when they became very defensive and started threatening me that they were going to put my old battery back in my car, if I did not like it, and send me on my way with a malfunctioning, dead battery hours from home.

When the father and owner, Mark Clifton, heard these comments by his son, Ryan, he came over not to help in the matter, but rather to escalate it further by rambling on and on about how, you know, that he is the expert with all these years of experience and how his $10,000 diagnostic computer has to be paid for somehow, and that it would cost me an additional $140 because that's how much they normally charge when a customer brings in a car with an engine light on. Eventhough, in my case, no engine light was on.

Anyways, when I tried just ask the owner how much for the service, so I could just pay and leave, that's when he threatened me by saying that this was his place and that he could treat anyone anyway he wanted there.  I was speechless and just wanted to get my car and leave. So, I paid what they wanted and just left as soon as I could.

I, obviously, will never be back, and it's probably safer for me that way.<//review>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1559073726575, 'text': "During a battery replacement, when possible voltage is maintained on the vehicle to prevent memory loss of various control units while the old battery is disconnected and replaced. This is not a practice for cutting corners, it is what's safest for the vehicle and an attempt to prevent other potential problems. It was not written or implied that any coding would be performed during or after the battery replacement. This client could not be convinced otherwise and I admit that my Dad and I were both frustrated. Displaying our frustration was unprofessional and made this problem worse than it should have been. I am sorry Ray for your poor experience here."}</resp>< gmapID>

Only place I will take my two AMGs.  Forget the dealership, Ryan and his team will take better care of your car, fix it right the first time, not sell you services or parts you don’t need, and save you money while doing it.  One of the cleanest, most well run shops I’ve ever dealt with.< /Review>

<Text>From the very first time I stepped foot in this dealership, I felt welcomed and very confident with their work.    I have never received anything less then excellent service. They have been 100% honest and very fair pricing with their service.  Ryan always has a smile and makes me feel like I'm the only customer in the world.  I always tell Mark (the owner) he has a twinkle in his eye which shows the love he has for what he does and a genuine concern to help.  I love this place and I tell everyone who will listen about it.    And believe me I am not easily pleased so this is saying a lot!   Clifton Mercedes is more than triple platinum in my book.</Text>< Pictures>

We have been going to Clifton Mercedes for ten years.  From day one we found that the service has been above satisfactory.  They even helped us with our daughter's car which was not a Mercedes - calling someone in the business whom they knew to make sure she had her Prius battery replacement done correctly.

Mark and Ryan are friendly, helpful and go out of their way to make the repair experience a good one.  No complaints whatsoever!</review>

<Time>1527224930605</Time><Rating>3< /Rating><review>We love which wich but sad to see stores closing left and right. Our closest one was in Northridge and have to drive further to come here. We waited for more than 10 minutes before someone attended to us. The entire place was empty that whole time. We weren't sure if they're open or closed.
Really wanted to give more stars because we love the chain but the lack of service kills it. The girl who took our order was nice but she had long nails, not sure how she's in food prep. I should use up my gift card before this place close down...<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNovtsqfrj-b-DYR-x3HmsePdzlrJfilXD9PT-1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4TuTHX7n5Dp3e_NIGyU0WvLLujdGL59wCteoa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>Was on my way to work today, ordered through the app so I would have to just pick up my meal. Get to location and person working there had no idea what I came to pick up. He thought I had the wrong location but checked my app and I was at the right place. Had to wait 15+ min to get my order done. He didn't notice and order had come in. Disappointed with today. Just wasted my time.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>AT first I was thrown off by the ordering process The sandwich establishment practices, but overall it was a pleasant experience. The atmosphere was fresh and relaxed and the place was clean and appealing to the eye. The Sandwiches are second to none. Btw< /review></record>

Service was mediocre, food is NOT consistent. Went today and a young Caucasian man at 6:30 made my sandwich. Eggs were barely cooked, cheese not melted, and the sand which was terribly put together. Not to mention I asked for no onions and I get onions!</text>

< Review>
Wich Wich has great sandwiches. About This particular location: Parking is a Pain in the A.. and after long wait for parking, you face post notes on their menu board that they are out of certain sandwiches, and it happens  almost everyday (specifically Avocado). Manage your ingredients inventory please!< /Review>

< Review>
Shop owner was friendly and helpful, and exactly the kind of business owner I like to see in my town and support with my custom. Very extensive inventory of all things necessary to brew; I was looking forfir products specific to a different project but he was able to help me find what I needed and it was easy to chat with him about what the different products do and how they affect our respective projects! Look forward to visiting again :)</Review>

This store had everything I needed, the service was fast and friendly and the store was clean. I love that they had everything I needed and didn't have to order anything or wait for it to come in. They even have local honey!  The guys who work there are awesome! Ralph and Jay are so friendly and professional.< /Text>

Absolutely wonderful home brew shop. Run by great people that have a passion for Brewing. Customer service is exceptional. They almost always have what I want and if they don't they can order it for me. Prices are extremely competitive even with online shopping . I highly recommend Simi Valley Homebrew</text>

I drove 70 miles out of my way to go and get supplies from this place. Yelp said that they were open till 8 p.m. I checked their website and it also said they were open till 8 p.m. I got there well before 8 p.m. and they were closed. When you drive 70 miles out of your way to a place that their own website says that they're going to be open and they're not, really sucks. I will never go there again and I'll make sure to tell everyone that I know, there are better places to go.< /Text>

My father and I took a home brew class from Simi Valley Home Brew, and have been brewing beers for about four months.  We loved the class, and really enjoy making our own beer.  They have a lot of recipes, and all the supplies you need to make your own beer, a one stop shop.< /Review>

Very knowledgeable in all aspects of home brewing.  Most stores today just don't have employees that know what they are talking about.  Simi Valley Home Brew is an exception to that.  They aren't in a hurry to get you out the door and are happy to share their trade with you.<//Text>

Great local shop, so excited Simi has a home brew shop! Went in for ingredients for my fourth batch, and the owner gave me some excellent pointers. They certainly are not full of themselves as we know some shops are :) Will be back soon.<//Text>

<Review>This place was suggested to me by a friend since I'm newly working in the area. I ordered a steak burrito and two steak tacos. I was extremely surprised at the quality of the steak as it seemed to be a much higher grade than I'm used to. Will definitely be back.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Here it goes. I love the crunchy tacos from here they’re so good, don’t get me wrong the food is great here, however, their super burrito is PLAIN. I thought super was suppose to include everything right? Apparently it only includes meat, beans and rice... 😒😔  this is why I’m giving them 2 stars.<//text>

<Text>I've been coming here for more than a decade and the quality is consistently excellent. They have some of the best carnitas in the area, and their pastor is also really good, but the real key is their salsa, as their name would imply. I usually get a pastor soft taco and a been and cheese burrito. So good. They have also adapted well (and early) to all the social distancing, and the fact that they've had a separate entrance and area specifically for to-go orders for years probably helped make that easier. They do now have a few tables outside for eating. This is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant in Antioch.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

All hands down the BEST BURRITOS EVER! Everything is professionally prepared and cooked to absolute perfection! I know this because I eat everywhere as I deliver to a lot of taquerias and restaurants and taco trucks so I can vouch when I say this!< /Review>

The best Mexican food hands down👍. The service is great, if you ordered previously they know what you want already so it’s really no big wait. The food is constant, the chef is amazing and the salsa is to die for. If you’re really hungry , try the Chile rellono dinner or the pozole soup, it’s hearty and heart warming.</Review>

This place was great! Loved the tacos, I had 2 crispy and one regular. The regular taco did not stand a chance to get a picture lol. My partner had a combo plate with a chicken enchilada and crispy taco which he loved. The jamaica was some of the best I've had in awhile. You could actually taste the hibiscus. Even the service was very kind, and the place was really clean and fun to be in.</text>

Always nice and Polite! The Ladies are always so kind and in a good mood everytime we have gone in! I HIGHLY recommend the Tortas Ahogadas if you like Spicy Food. The Bread they use gets super tender without falling apart, and they're sauce is one of my absolute favorite spicy tomato chili sauces Ive ever tried. If youre not as into spicy, their Nachos are also a great choice and I've never had any qualms or issues with them. Nothing but delicious flavors and perfectly grilled meat! 😄 10/10!< /Review>

We been coming to Salsas for 4 year's I must say the is Quite delicious, especially the tortilla soup I had today. It was amazing. I personally have given it four stars. Cuz the prices are really Sky High. And being where it's at. I think they need to cut down on the prices a little bit. Clean up the restrooms tidy up. And work on the customer service is very important. Keep up the good work and will continue coming to your place. Thank you for your service.<//Text>

You know what's nice about going to a good Mexican restaurant?  When they have it decorated and it feels like you're not in your home town anymore. Feels like you get a little change from the normal. This place is done up nice. Was fun to sit and eat tasty food in a nice ambiance. You should try it.</Review>< pictures>

I have lived in Contra Costa for 12 years originally from Alameda County and my boyfriend just put me on this place. I don't know how I have survived living out here without them! When I first moved here people recommended Mecca and I couldn't understand the hype. I found Carnitas Tijuana but then change in ownership a few years back  left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Now...taco heaven!! Their crispy chicken tacos are a dream and the burritos are so succulent! My kids love the beef and carne asada. They can get pricey but its worth every penny! Love this place!!!!!< /review>

Love, love, love their salsa so it's appropriate they named their restaurant after it. Gets pretty crowded at lunchtime because of the Kaiser next door- so try to come at off hours. My go to spot for Mexican food. Nothing beats this place. Service is always great, workers always so friendly. Food is served quick. Always recommend.</Text>< user>

<text>The food that this restaurant serves is nothing short of pure culinary excellence. The burrito mojados are the best I've ever had. The food is impressively consistent and the staff is always friendly and hospitable. Love this place.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>Great burrito’s after a visit to the doctor! Had the carne asada burrito which was flavorful and filling. I wish I lived closer so I could visit more. Lots of room to dine in and the staff is friendly. Food is cooked quickly so not a long wait if you’re eating there or getting to go.<//review>< rate>

Food taste good but by the time you get your food you already lost your appetite....they take too long to serve or make your order (no disrespect to ownership) i know that place since 1994!< /Review>

<Review>This place has the best Mexican food in the Bay Area. If you want delicious, authentic food, or just a really good burrito, I recommend going here. We have had family fights over who gets the leftovers lol. It's priced fairly and the drinks are great.<//Review><GmapID>0x808559bd50a36e3d:0x20247e8ae569d22f<//GmapID></record>

I think the burritos are good the meat could use a little more flavor but is cooked well I like the fact it's not overcooked... I would give a higher rating but this my second time ordering extra cheese on my burritos being charged extra for it and not receiving it.<//Text>

<Text>This place is my partner & I's all time favorite spot for our burritos. This place has never disappointed me or my husband. We always get the Super Burrito with Steak and Shrimp and it's extra $1 for each. They only have shrimp on Fridays & Saturdays. The shrimps are always fresh tasting and cooked to perfection. The steak melts in your mouth. You can taste how fresh & flavorful it is. It has sour cream, guacamole, rice, beans, pico de gallo, cheese & whatever meat you choose.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Moved to Monterey from the East Bay. Can't find good Mexican food there. Come back to Antioch and have Mexican food at taqueria salsa to satisfy my craving. Nothing beats the super burrito!</Review>

<Text>Taqueria Salsa is our favorite mexican restaurant in town! We usually go 2-3 times a month. I usually get the carne asada tacos and they're worth the extra $1 they charge for carne asada. I tried the tortilla soup and fell in love. The portion is huge and it's always delicious.</Text><date>1565039927121< /date><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

f you like authentic Mexican food, you have to stop in at Salsa Taqueria. We use to drive miles for real Mexican cuisine, but not anymore. Conveniently located in west Antioch, near the County East Mall, is the best Mexican food anywhere. From the chips and many salsas to a main course of Carne Asada burritos, this is the best. The family owned restaurant is friendly, fast, and delicious. The Tostada Grande is to die for.<//Review>

Best mexican food in Antioch. Nothing fancy, just good old authentic traditional mexican food. The salsa is good, hot, medium and mild. The service is good.<//Review>

<Review>After a 2.5 hour hike I was hungry. Hungry. I knew I wanted a burrito at a Taqueria. I looked up Mexican food in Antioch and came across Taqueria salsa. Ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was twice as big as I expected and delicious. I can't wait to come back and bring my husband with me!< /Review>< userid>

Beans taste sour and are unusually runny. Rice was really bland with no flavor. Crispy tacos were okay. Got a huge piece of beef that was mostly fat and that was most the meat in my taco. Wouldn't go back. Much better options in the area.</review>

No veggie burrito option. No free chips with order or refills. Small burritos and high prices compared to tacquerias in Concord. No plastic cups for salsa without asking.< /review>

Quick hot delicious Mexican food at a price that won't break your budget. Combination plates around $10, half orders around $6. Great lunch spot for LMC students. Decor is very comfortable and feels authentic. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Pittsburg to Brentwood.< /Text>

<review>You charged for chips that weren't very good and food was  covered in too much sauce and cheese. I will look for a better Mexican restaurant with free chips. Invasion of privacy you sent this  message   and I don't know how. I left my phone in the car and paid cash?????????<//review>< user_name>

<Review>My wife and I eat here a couple times a week, sometimes more, it's our favorite restaurant.  Their burritos are delicious and their carne asada has a great marinated  flavor. I haven't had salsa anywhere in northen or southern California that beats their red spicy salsa. My wife prefers the mild salsa, they have a variety that will suit everyone's needs. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for good Mexican food with fast, friendly service.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< Pics>

High prices and you have to pay for chips? Bland burritos use to be really good feels like a big chain restaurant now.<//text>

Asada burritos and their salsa is very good, although expensive. Adding a few things adds up pretty quick on your bill.< /Text>
