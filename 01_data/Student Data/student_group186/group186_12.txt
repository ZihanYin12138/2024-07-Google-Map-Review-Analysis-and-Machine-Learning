Phenomenal dinner. Top notch food. You get what you pay for. Great atmosphere and friendly service. A little tough to see from the street, but they use Valet service to park your car. Classy place and very nice place to have an upscale dinner.< /Text>

Valet parking is complimentary (tips are appropriate). Kind, professional staff, delicious food on a varied menu. Clean, safe environment.<//text>

<review>I had a friend move to the area and we happened to stumble upon this hidden gem... this place is so cute! From the decor, to the utensils / dish ware, to the service, to the food and the drinks, it was AMAZING! You can tell this place was carefully designed, every detail was thought out. Our server, Juan, was the best! He suggested we try the empanadas which were delicious. He was super attentive and friendly. I had the spicy mango margarita and it was perfection! Definitely will be back to try their steaks. This place is a must if you’re in the area!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I want to highlight an amazing experience our family shared here celebrating the queen's birthday of the family. We came here to support an Armenian business, especially during these trying times when we must unite.

The outdoor seating area was done in a unique way and it honestly felt like being in a restaurant prior to COVID. The decorative lighting and the seating was arranged in a "feng shui" way. I don't think I ever got to use that word in a sentence, but found it appropriate lol. Each and every dish we shared was cooked to perfection and presented outstandingly. Jack Guschyan, the executive chef here at Oasis, was kind enough to also bring out a complimentary dish he created. The pictures should speak for themselves.

Thank you for the wonderful experience Jack and Oasis team :)<//review>< gmap_id>

We can first start with the food, it was amazing! The lamb chops perfect temp.
Waygun burger amazing medium rare.
L.A Style corn beautiful taste.
The cocktails were not on my side of taste unfortunately. Waited for 10mins for water and other drinks.
The thing that threw me off was the poor lack of service. The area smelled a lot like cigarettes, couldn’t enjoy my stay. Over all beautiful environment..< /review>

Food was great! But when I got the bill for $94 there was a service charge of over $15 which took my bill up to $109. Restaurant’s menu is not kid friendly, although they did split the meal into three for my kids. Servers were perfect though.
*Reply to business*
If the service charge is split between the crew, it should be told to the patrons before they order, I ordered three entrees with no drinks. Three entrees and no drinks at $109 is still kind of ridiculous. I don’t mind the $94 but there was nothing about a service fee and it would have been nice to know that there would be a % added additional to my tip. So if that is the case I think I would like my tip back because you already paid them a tip from my bill before I even got the bill.< /Review>

Unlike kitchen cooked food we do have hibachi grill brought to your table, the cheff comes out to perform a show and cook the food at the table. We do accommodate our customers by not forcing to order food for each person at the table. And as it was stated by the server, children can share a meal since the portions we serve are very large. We do try to keep our price as low as possible. Service charges are divide amongst the servers, chefs and the bussing staff since it is a labor intensive operation.'}</Response>

< review>
Ate here tonight, so happy to have a great Japanese/teppanyaki place nearby. First of all the service was fantastic, atmosphere is also really neat. We sat at a table outside and after you order they bring the grill out near your table and cook your food. The chef was very friendly and entertaining, but most importantly cooked us a fantastic meal! We both ordered the Three's Company (filet mignon, shrimp and chicken). All of it was great and we will definitely be back!</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Great Japanese restaurant in North Hollywood.
You eat outdoors in closed tents. A table for a tent.
Privacy assured!
They cook meat and fish in front of your table exclusively for you with a giant plate.
Very particular. To try.
We were there with our fraternal friend Armen and we also met the delightful Gaspar manager.
Greetings from Italy.

(Original)
Ottimo ristorante giapponese in North Hollywood.
Si mangia all'aperto in delle tende chiuse. Un tavolo per una tenda.
Privacy assicurata!
Cucinano carne e pesce davanti al tuo tavolo esclusivamente per te con una piastra gigante.
Molto particolare. Da provare.
Ci siamo stati con il nostro amico fraterno Armen ed abbiamo conosciuto anche il manager Gaspar persona deliziosa.
Saluti dall'Italia.<//Text>< resp>

I will say, I love the food here. The Moussaka is possibly the best I've ever had! My issue with the place is that they seem to charge you extra for everything unnecessarily. If you want some feta on your fries, it's more. If you want some Tzatziki, it's more. I just don't like the principle of it.< /review>

Good food for family recipes.
The servers seem to be family members and the place is very inviting.
The soup was salty but good.
The moussaka was good, but not too flavorful.
The price reflects the portion size.<//review>

Fantastic neighborhood Greek restaurant! Delicious food, affordable prices. Don't let the exterior lead you to think it is only a fast food place. This is a full-on restaurant.  I highly recommend it!</Text>

Soula the hostess cannot be trusted around customers or food. The cook may be good, but I wouldn't trust that nothing else is done to your food, or your check. I just recommend that you go to Luna Grill down the road where you can trust the franchises cleanliness and get friendly service with your Greek food.< /text>

I have had lunch here a few times and have enjoyed it every time. I really like their chicken and rice soup with lemon and their gyro salad. Check out their deserts and Greek coffee.  Service has always been excellent. I'll be trying dinner here soon.< /Text>

This is family owned and operated. They provide good service and food. The portions are average which is plenty. Most of the food is hand made there. It's traditional Greek and delicious.</text>

Overpriced for what it is. Not terrible but kinda meh quality for restaurant prices. Got the "lunch special" greek salad and the portion size was also pretty small. The service there was very friendly, but not impressed with the food.<//Review>

<text>This place is amazing. Perfect gyros. French fries out of this world. I havent explored their menu because those alone got me addicted. 😂 its a nice and quiet resturant. Its got carry-out also. Its one of the few encinitas restaurants i recommend. Check out Mr. Peabody's for a great cheeseburger.</text><rate>5<//rate><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Heard this was the BEST Greek food in San Diego, had to try it.  Not only is it the best Greek food in the County, the family that runs the place are the best people!  Family-style atmosphere, great service, and the food is delicious.  Favorites are the DOLMADAKIA and PAIDAKIA SKARAS.  Their GYROS sandwich is a very filling and perfectly tasty lunch meal.  You must go!  Say hi to Rita!</text>

My children and I have been visiting this place since 2007.  This is the best Greek food served with a smile in San Diego.  You must try the traditional lemon chicken soup (Avgo-lemono) and everything else is amazing too.

You will see this same family serving food at the annual Greek festival in Encinitas as well.< /text>

Excellent value.  Specialties are their baked goods which are extraordinarily good.  Location is a bit out of the way but still close enough.  Plenty of parking.  Only open for breakfast and lunch.  Wish they had better tables and chairs.< /Review>

Pretty average place to eat.  The most anyone part of the breakfast was the waitresses.  One came to get my drink order (water) and didn't bring it.  Someone else asked me and brought it maybe 10 minutes later.  When the rest of our party came in, we ordered their drinks and again she forgot.  And she even got the drink order wrong (one iced tea, one water extra lemon and a Coke with a water).  Not terribly difficult.  When she did refill the drinks there was no ice so all the water was warm.  We even had to repeat the dessert order when standing right in front of her and it was only 2 tiny cupcakes.  They weren't even busy there was only two other tables occupied.  The food was very average, nothing terribly good not bad.  I've been to both locations and I would say Gilroy is definitely better.< /Text>

This place was not very good at all. My mushroom omelette was soggy & had no flavor. They forgot to give me an item that I ordered. And the waitress was a little rude & unfriendly. She didn't make eye contact or smile even once. It was also overpriced. My daughter and I will not be returning.< /Text>

The food here is very soggy and bland. I ordered a panini, and the bread was completely soggy--not toasty and crunchy. The menu said the onions were supposed to be caramelized, which was why I ordered it, but they were white and crunchy, almost completely fresh. The staff seems uncomfortable and inexperienced, because we waited a while before anyone ever took our order. And the coffee was so weak it looked like iced tea. Not wasting my money here again.< /review>

<text>We stopped by here for brunch on our way to strawberry picking and both the food and service were amazing! We ordered the scrambled eggs, panini, jalapeno scone, and a side of jalapeno jelly. The jalapeno jelly made everything taste 10x better. It was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. We will definitely be coming back here in the future when we go fruit picking. The price was super affordable for such high quality.<//text><resp>None</resp>< time>

Adorable atmosphere, great service and WONDERFUL food. I had Josephine's omlet. It came with fruit and a choice of a muffin. I chose pumpkin cheesecake just to be festive. All delicious. Will be back.<//Text>

-  The service was ok at best, excuses excuses for the tardiness. I had lip stick on cup. I made the waitress aware of and she joked about it asking me if it wasn't my shade... i just look at her, really? it was disgusting!
- The food took longer than it should and was mediocre. My son's sandwich was soggy looked like they used a stick of butter, my daughters skirt steak sandwich wasn't trimmed, full of fat chunks and looked like it was just thrown together. My au jus for my french dip had no taste, just water with food coloring. The lemonade had a metallic taste, seemed like they didn't know how much Country Time lemonade powder to use. My wife's sandwich was the only thing that was fine. We left most of the food... just wasn't good

We wanted to like this place, but we'll pass on this restaurant next time.< /Text>< user>

<Text>We  have visited Josephine's four times since we moved to San Martin three months ago and have brought friends with us twice.  Josephine's Bakery is a small personable spot to take friends for scones and muffins; sandwiches and salads. I'm not a lover of scones but Josephine's baker makes the best. Then there's the cakes, mini cupcakes, small cakes for two and beyond.< /Text>< Rate>

The cakes, pastries and other baked goods are the draw, of course, and are fantastic.  They also serve a good breakfast and lunch menu.  Service is excellent.<//review>

We've been coming here since we moved to MH on Feb of this year--- it's practically across the street from our house. One thing I can say though, very friendly. The place is named after their grandma Josephine. The menu is very light and has not changed in a while. Their baked goods are delicious, perfect for small parties but you can order caked and cupcakes however you wish. Everything is baked on site and you can tell they're made from scratch. Family friendly and the decor is always cheerful.< /text>

<Review>We went in for a panini.
Both of ours came to us completely flattened and 1 piece of cheese for a loaded cheddar panini.
I won't be ordering a sandwich there again.
Think we should have ordered breakfast instead</Review>< Name>

Hard to give this place a good review, as they appear to just randomly be closed during their stated business hours (9 AM on a Tuesday). Maybe they have gone out of business? Either way, don't count on this place for a meal.<//review>

Their cakes are amazing. I ordered 3 half-sheets for a friends retirement celebration. German Chocolate with Baverian frosting; lemon with raspberry filling and buttercream frosting; and red velvet with white buttercream. All 3 were delicious, moist, and loved by all who were there.</review>

< Review>
I had went a placed an order online to buy my husband a Simpson helmet as Christmas gift. I had called the phone number provided in the website to ask about the return policy since it was a Christmas gift and my husband most likely was going to get it on Christmas Day. Little did I know the size I order was XL and found out my husband current helmet size was L. Called Eddie to see if I could change the size to a L before it shipped. He was super nice and made it happen. Once the helmet arrived hubby received it so no more waiting until Christmas Day! (Since he works from home). Found out that the size L in that specific type of helmet was a little big still. Also the hubby is a little picky and hard to find the right present he decided he wanted a M Matte black instead of the glossy he got! Called Eddie and he went above and beyond to get the size and the color as requested. Made it super easy for us to return the current helmet and get the new one super fast. Hands down amazing business and amazing customer service. The only thing is that they don’t have Tshirts or stickers in their website to shop we love to buy shirts and hubby loves stickers to add to his tool box of the different places we buy from that is related with bikes. Eddie did said they are working on stocking with apparel which we can’t wait overall super recommended.</Review>

The Guys at John Jessups Dream Rides were Awesome, Friendly and professional.  I couldn't have asked for better treatment. Also from the guys at Legend suspensions. My Bike feels incredible. I'm so glad I installed LEGENDS on all four corners. The backs were such an improvement that I had to go ahead and do the fronts. I really don't know how to explain it except it made my bike even better than it was and not by a little bit.<//Text>

Eddie is the best!  I am a repeat customer from San Diego and I am very impressed with his customer  service skills. I received all the parts I ordered faster than Amazon Prime.  I will definitely shop through their website again. If you have any questions or need a particular part, contact Eddie via text/email and he will take care of you.

Also supports Veterans/Military members!!!<//review>

I can’t say enough good things about eddie. I am a finance guy for a Harley Dealer and constantly having customers ask for recommendations. I’m always hesitant because when things go south it’s my fault. I’m extremely pleased to have found dream rides and am confident in eddies customer services that I couldn’t send all my customers here with no issues</text>

Went to Dream rides today on my lunch break, met a guy named John at the front desk. Nice attitude, good conversation... Even the customers had good things to say about the staff when I was out side checking out the bikes< /Review>

<Review>John and his crew are always friendly and are helpful. When you own a Harley, ( their specialty) you need a tech/mech you can trust, and there you will find them. The only negatives are the mark-up price %, and they can be a little slow. But just look at the volume of work pending and you can see why. And it is a case of you get what you pay for. Quality doesn't come cheap...now serving # 237...< /Review><Rating>4< /Rating><GmapID>0x809012f3368e0cd9:0xb28348bc325e78cf< /GmapID></record>

Dreamrides is a great shop with great people. They are very knowledgeable with all makes and  models of motor cycles. They are very dependable and honest. They everything from old changes and basic service to complete custom builds including motors and suspension and all sorts of bolt on parts. They also have an in house dyno tuner. Really a one stop shop and a great asset to the san joaquin valley and stockton.<//Text>

This is the only place to do business in this area, hands down the best service, responsiveness and know-how you're going to find in this crap hole town. I wouldn't trust anyone else with my 100TH Anniversary HD-Softail. I crashed it and John took the burden off my shoulders step by step made sure insurance took care of my rig and I'll be damn if he didn't put me and my satisfaction first! He never missed a call, always answered, worked with my needs/wants start to finish and always  kept it real! Never will set foot into a corporate Harley again, john's on my speed-dial and would ride next to that man any day. If you're a biker, this is where you wanna be. Thanks John, couldn't be happier or ask for more!</text>

This was the most popping Ace hardware store I have been to. The employees were incredibly helpful and straightforward, but they would talk to you more if you wanted to. It was super clean and efficient and managed to get what I needed in 5 mins. The environment was great with jamming music and the have the coolest key selection.<//text>

<Text>This hardware store has everything you want plus good old-fashioned great customer service. It’s amazing how they can have almost everything in such a small space including cutting lumber to specific sizes. Their super helpful with home projects and they’re just nice people and dog friendly so Stella gives them two paws up.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqgNMDn-mdU-Np_5eauiSZnn6oz-71vmDtK0oV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJYShKioKKPgblpp4Srqc_iaq3FPtCVihpd29a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMl6m8lFLKgYW6WZlpcDJc4hBOO6y8j6ggszRy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkavinnYJysW0tluXgxn8OCR9vXsRYa9MclleH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>Not sure who still goes to the local hardware store, but I came here after having no luck at the big box store. What I appreciate about stores like this is the SERVICE. An actual human who sees you in the aisle, recognizes the confusion on your face, and offers genuine help. Although they didn't have what I was looking for this time, I'll make every effort to return next home improvement project, just to keep stores like this in business.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Ace hardware has always been the go to hardware store due to convenience and home minor wears and tears, In zaferia and then it's on to the mothership homedepot. It's a great place to get tools and great projects like Artwork can come out of ace hardware. The last project I had built was a simple table top book shelf I had cut in store and embedded on top of my 8x3 desk which works out really nice if your looking for a project or just out and in need of your home remedies check out ace.< /text><userid>115507467535503771932<//userid>< name>

<review>I found an available item that I was urgently looking for in the website.  It says it's available to pick up on the same date.  However I wanted to verify its availability by calling.   When I called and spoke to an agent, the lady said it is not available. Okay then why did you leave it say available?  My guess is someone put a hold on it and that's probably why but she didn't say any detail about it.  Not transparent and incorrect information for the customers.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
While I was at this pace Hardware buying cleaning products I remembered I needed to make a copy of my car key so I have an extra one so the person who helped me we went off my car it was a little tricky we wasn't working really well he went back in and recut it came back out with still sticking the door and ignition but he went back and cut it and came back and he just fine so couple weeks later I was trying to find my car key I couldn't find it I remembered I had a spare I used it and at the end of the day I couldn't get my key out of the car door it's stuck I had to call a taxi go to work my mechanic had a tow truck came and get my to get my car mike micanic ended up telling me that the extra key that I had made at Ace Hardware was the reason that I was having these car problems now I had to replace the whole door hole lock system and now my micanic tells me that I'm going to have to have my car alarm totally disarmed I wouldn't Ace Hardware talk to the owner Tommy he owns this one and the one on 4th Street Long Beach and Tommy says that he will not give me a refund of $150
key replacement that cause all these problems in the first place I'm just very frustrated I try to explain to him the situation he would not hear it and now I feel like he's dodging me everytime he's at one store I go there and he's not there I go to the other stories not there<//Review>

Best ACE store, with the kindest knowledgeable employees!  Not to mention the great owners.  I used to work in Property Management and would frequent this location quite often, and can't say enough good things about this location and how it is ran.  Go here if you can and support their business!<//review>

Had never been to this Ace Hardware before. And although they're small, they have quite a nice moment selection of products. Had exactly what I needed. Great customer service was a plus.< /Text>

<Text>Before people judge my comment, I'll disclose I am female. And the females that work the counter are annoying. Theyre too busy gossiping to be productive or pay attention. I always ask a male worker to get things done. But overall the customer service is not bad by any means. The cashiers just suck. But they're still nice.< /Text>< Response>

This store is a good option for those folks that need something for their house (electrical/plumbing/paint) and don't want to go to the Big Two Monsters (Home Depot/Lowes). A little pricey but convenient< /text>

<Review>Ace is the place! Every time I come in this store I’m greeted with a smile and asked if I need help by at least two people. Everyone here is so helpful and knowledgeable that I go here before i go to any other hardware store. They have helped me with all my projects both big and small. Great people and great service!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Awesome selection, they have everything! And if they dont have it they can order it or make some calls and get it for you. Customer service is out of this world, they really go above and beyond to answer any questions, or solve any problem you might have. Defiently recommend.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>What a cool hardware store in Long Beach. It is no bigger than a minue yet between the floor and the celing they seem to stock EVERYTHING. I have always found what I went there to get. Its clean and folks are happy and helpful. I had a screen fixed there once not too long ago and the price was awesomely low. To this day the fix they fixed is still fixed! I would recomend this Ace hardwear store to everyone looking to get their handyman/woman needs met. Funky hours though so call ahead. I give Ace Hardwear here in Long Beach two screws up !🔧🔨🧰🔩< /text><Response>None</Response>< rate>

Then after he was done he preceded to try and pull out gray hair of the female coworker why she was trying to make my key. Unprofessional,  who manages these employees?</text>< pics>

Wow wow wow!! This is my second year getting my taxes done by this company, Steven is the man! Really attentive, I appreciate the urgency in his work, easy to contact, easy to work with, but most importantly to me was how fast he was able to get things done for me when I was in a time crunch! No looking back this is my go to place! Recommending all my friends and family to check out Steven at corrals income tax! Keep up the good work guys! See you next year!</Review>

This was my first time doing taxes and was super confused in the process but everyone at Corral's was supper friendly and professional. They helped me understand the process and guided me through every step. I left with through information and will definitely be coming back! Super friendly environment! Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a place to do their taxes :)< /review>

The people at this place really make me feel at home and welcomed. They truly work to ensure that you get the most out of your tax return. Not only that but they explain and give reasoning as to why certain rules and regulations are applied to taxes. Great business and great people. Highly recommend<//text>

If I could give 6 stars, I would. They really value you as a client. You’re not just another number. There is a reason why they have 5 stars only. World class service. Very knowledgeable and very informative. Can’t thank you guys enough. They make the process nice and smooth. Responded to all my questions in a timely matter. Beyond grateful to have them do my taxes. Thank you again!!!<//Text>

I came to Corrals Income Tax for the first time last year. I came back this year because they were very professional and friendly. My mom referred me over and she has also had a great experience. My taxes were done in a timely manner. Definitely recommend. They also speak Spanish and English.<//text>

{'time': 1617477874726, 'text': 'Good morning Alex. 10 years is a long time! Thank you for your loyalty and trust. We understand your frustration. Unfortunately, there are many different reasons why the IRS might adjust your tax return. We could always help you contact them and figure out why they withheld funds from you. This is definitely concerning, so we went ahead and looked into it for you. Fortunately, they were able to explain their reasoning for your adjustment. You were disallowed the "Stimulus Recovery Rebate Credit" of $1,200 because (according to their system) you already received your FIRST stimulus payment. Unfortunately, the IRS won\'t pay anybody a stimulus twice. We understand there may have been some confusion. So if you never did receive your first stimulus check, and you would like to DISPUTE the IRS\'s decision, we\'d be happy to help you with that. If there\'s anything else we could do to help, feel free to give us a call. Thanks again for reaching out. Take care and God bless!!'}</Response>

Plumbing Specialists is the place to get all of your needs met. I give 5 stars. The service was great. My specialist was a cool guy by the name of JOHN. He has a lot of knowledge and can fix and troubleshoot anything. JOHN should be a plumbing specialist trainer. He knows his craft. Thanks JOHN for installing our water heater.
And the price was affordable. Thanks plumbing specialists for also being 24 hours.</text>

< review>
I had 2 plumbers out to ID problem & give estimate. The first wanted to re- pipe my whole condo because I have a cement slab. ( have it go up and thru the attic)!
I’m sorry I have forgotten the plumbers name from Specialist. He was great! I had a leak in th main water pipe  so water was leaking under my entrance & office area. He replaced the pipe by going thru the inside wall. It took about 3 - 4 hours. He never took a break, informed me in advance of work being done. I definitely  would recommend this company!</review>

John was a professional, courteous and fast. When situation was explained to him, he immediately went to work and found the leaks and made the repairs. He even found other things and suggested what was to be done there. This guy was good, and I look forward to acquiring their services in the future.
Thanks< /review>

I was referred to Plumbing Specialists through a plumber!! I would give them 10 stars if I could. I called and asked if they could come out and look at a property in Riverside that was having plumbing issues. They came out and told me that they found a crushed pipe under ground. The pipe was under the driveway. They fixed everything in 1 afternoon. I’m amazed!!< /Text>

< Review>
Plumbing Specialist, Inc. was timely, friendly, professional and addressed our need.  They were reasonable in their pricing and did not charge us for the downtime - over an hour - that was required to get a necessary camera there in order to locate the specific nature of the clog.  I would highly recommend their service.< /Review>

<Text>Edit:
2020, Patrick has been back to do two more projects for us. STELLAR work again. Today's job could have been awful. But Patrick made it look easy and I have every confidence the work is high quality. He had to remove my foundation to change the position of my kitchen sink. Awesome work! I still highly recommend.
2019 I had two previous plumbers for my project that were awful. Bad work and no shows. Brian heard the desperation in my voice and personally came and looked my job. He didnt have to, but he did it to help me! When the work started, he sent me Patrick. I can't say "Thank You!!!" enough. He helped me deal with the crummy work being done by Tim Grimes at Mission Restoration. Patrick fixed what he needed to and helped me to know what to watch for and insist on with the tile crew. Once that part was over  Patrick and JR came back to install the toilet, tub, shower, and sink faucets. They were AWESOME.
They got all that done in a timely manner and left the site spotless!
As an extra bonus, the ladies in the office are super. They are courteous, knowledgeable, and (in dealing with me) patient.
I highly recommend Brian and his team at Plumbing Specialist, Inc.< /Text><response>{'time': 1560379237523, 'text': "Thank you for the kind words, we really appreciate customer feedback.

If you are in need of a plumber there is one and only one place to call! Plumbing Specialists!  I live in an old house with terrible plumbing.  I have called Plumbing Specialists out 2 times and would never consider calling another company.  Not only were the plumbers friendly, talented and extremely professional, but the girls in the office are just a pleasure to talk to. I feel like I made a friend in Michelle, she is a treasure. Our situation became one that any other company would have turned us away (we didn't have the money at the time, my husband was laid off and I am struggling with health problems)  Plumbing Specialists took care of our plumbing problem and is letting us make payments! Can you believe that? It's true, these folks are a true blessing from God.  Thank you Plumbing Specialists, you are one in a million, if anyone calls anyone else for their plumbing needs they are making a huge mistake.</Review>

<Review>I am very happy with the service I received from PSI.  We had a major plumbing emergency yesterday.  They cam to the rescue within an hour of calling and went above and beyond to fix the issue.  Even though we have an older house, which caused the technician many challenges.

<review>The work to unclog my bathroom sink was good, but there was no cleanup afterwards.   It looked as if a bucket of dirty water was emptied in the shower.  I had to scrub away black silt type of deposits, and put everything back in the cabinet under the sink.<//review>< pics>

I had my first experience with Plumbing Specialist Inc. I must say that it was the best decision I took to call them for the problem I had with y water heater (GE which I will never purchased again.) I was getting the run around from Rheems Mfg which were saying one day they have the part and another day they don't have that part and at the same time we had no hot water for 6 days waiting for the part to come which  never did.
So i spoke with Amber at Plumbing Specialists. Inc. and "boom" with in the same day she found the part and the next day I had hot water. That girl rock and can get things done. Patrick the tech that came to my house took care of replacing the thermocouple the professional way and was extremely friendly. I am a homeowner, I have put this company in my contacts on my phone and will be my plumber from now one. I recommend these people highly and always speak with Amber. She will handle what ever your problem is!
Thank you gang!

<date>1534296267914< /date><text>I have to say that today I experienced the best customer service and professionalism I have had in over ten years..I'm not talking about a four star hotel or a fancy restaurant. I am speaking of the gentlemen who came to my door to fix my plumbing issue. Their names were John and J.R.  I had the pleasure to find my problem not only fixed, but it looked better than before.  They also cleaned up and made my shower area look immaculate. Both John and J.R. were polite, sincere, honest and right away I could tell they were experts in their field.
If you choose a plumber in Riverside then I recommend one phone call...to Plumbing Specialists, Inc.
This company is now my plumbing company for life thanks to both John and J.R.  I am now a loyal customer.  Thanks guys for making my week!

< Review>
I called Plumbing Specialists out due to my mainline backing up. It was happening quite often and the other company that I had been using wanted to charge me an outrageous amount to fix my problem. The technician that came out to my home from Plumbing Specialists sent a camera down the line, found the problem and fixed it in the same day. The price was fair and I have not had any problems since. I had an all around great experience from the receptionist to the technician. I highly recommend this company and will be calling them if any other problems should arise. Job well done!< /Review>

Very professional and quick!  I called to have one of my bedroom doors unlocked.  Daughter locked it and we couldn't find the key.  All city was quick and proficient.  He had me send a photo of the lock and he was able to tell me what he would be able to do.  He was here in ten minutes from the time I called. Very good service by Gary. Will definitely use again if needed.<//Text>

<Text>Stop looking for a locksmith. Gary is the BEST. Extremely skilled, fast, professional, affordable, and just plain nice. He worked magic with all the quirky old locks and door handles in our 111-year-old house. Then he fixed the problems with newer locks that were installed by others. Amazing!<//Text>< Pics>

Fantastic experience.  Gary arrived on time and I was very impressed how quickly he completed the job. The pricing was very reasonable and it was the same as what I was quoted over the phone. It is great to know there are still some trustworthy companies. I highly recommend All City Locksmith.</review>

<text>Impressive! All City Locksmith is professional and courteous. They arrive on time and did quality work. I had my new home re-keyed and they were very efficient. They are so good, that I have already recommended them to my co-workers at Kaiser. All City Locksmith has been a pleasure to deal with! All City Locksmith has made the transition to my new home easy ! Thank you!

One convenient key for my entire home!< /text>< pictures>

Front doorknob fell apart so I had Gary take a look at fixing it (it was a nice doorknob set). He came out on a Saturday morning, fixed it quickly (not an easy Alen wrench type fix) and charged a reasonable rate. This is the second time I have used him. He is timely, reasonable and knowledgeable.< /Text>

<Review>Gary is the best hands down! I was not happy with quotes I got from local locksmiths for a residential room lockout until I called Gary. I recall using him before and so glad I got him again! He was quick and cheap for the quality service and advice he provides and now on my speed dial. Don't waste your time going anywhere else!<//Review><gmapID>0x80c3363be0523d59:0x20120dac7174fbc8<//gmapID><Time>1594504673353</Time>< Rate>

<Text>Just had All City Locksmith come out today (6 Aug 2020). He was extremely knowledgeable and the service was quick. Changed all locks on our new home and made extra keys for my family. Total charge was only $73. I don't know if anyone can beat that. I called a couple other places and they wanted a minimum of $135. I definitely recommend All City.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

This is the second time I’ve used their services and they are always fast, reliable, courteous, and reasonably priced. The locksmith showed up in 30mins and was able to rekey all my locks in less than 30 minutes. Prices can’t be beat and some of the best customer service around! Call them for all your locksmith needs!!< /Text>

<text>My old key broke inside the lock and it was my only access to my office building. I panicked and rushed to yelp to find a local locksmith. I was worried of how much this was going to cost me but I had no other choice. I called Gary at All City and he came incredibly quick, worked his magic and got me back inside. He re-keyed the doors and priced the job very reasonably. I have found my go-to locksmith! Thanks so much Gary!<//text>< Rate>

Best locksmith I have ever worked with and I’ve been in real estate for over 17 years. Gary is a professional. He is fast and dependable. I highly recommend him. He’s always done a great job. He will do a great job for you too without a doubt, hands down a talented and great locksmith.</Text>

<text>I have a very pleasant experience with All City Locksmith this morning. My new office need a rekey for all the locks. Gary give me a very good price which is half of the other guy quote me. His work is great and honest. I have couples locks don’t have keys. One of them he spent half hour but no luck and he did not charge me a dime. Very nice service. Definitely will use him again.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c3363be0523d59:0x20120dac7174fbc8<//Gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1575728210776, 'text': 'Thank you for the review Kai.'}< /resp><pictures>None</pictures><userid>114196157130171777166<//userid>< Name>

I wish I could give All City Locksmith more than 5 stars! If you’re looking for an honest man to help you with keys or any other related services, Gary is the first person you should call! Today he helped me replace two car keys for my Honda Accord at an amazing price that will beat any other business. I certainly will continue to come back and refer my friends and family.<//Text>

We contacted Gary and he was here at our facility within 30 minutes. He re-keyed our Front & Back Doors and provided additional keys for over half of what we had paid last year to have the same thing done . I would Highly Recommend him and his company.

If you need a locksmith for commercial or residential, All City is the best out there. Our cleaning crew accidentally locked us out of the office at the gym we own. 20 minutes after calling All City, we are in and back to business as usual. Super fast, professional and competitively priced. Call All City before you waste your time on anyone else!< /review>

I used their service looking at the five star reviews they really deserve it
Gary is very thorough, very professional, polite,  respectful, prompt, finishes the job quickly is very experienced in all kinds of locks.  Who is the local hardware stores for locks that are not found in the regular Lowe’s and Home Depot .
He gives you choices via text messages so you can save money he sends you pictures and is able to pick up the item from store for you

He uses the iPhone, replies text right away even when it’s after-hours sometimes
I love it!
No other locksmith is this easy to reach and this affordable.
He even told me that I could do replace the lock myself as it’s simple and save money
He Sent me video on it
Who does that?
Thanks Gary  hope you get to expand your business we need Locksmiths like you.</Text>

We needed a last minute locksmith because the lock to enter our building had broken and we needed a quick turnaround time. After calling Gary, he came to our office building within minutes! He was a life saver!! and he provides excellent and efficient service at an affordable price! We will definitely be using his services again in the future!</text>

All City Locksmith is the place to call. Gary was amazing. I needed to have my house rekeyed ASAP. He was there in less than an hour, and went above and beyond. His price was extremely reasonable. I will recommend him to anyone that needs a locksmith and he will be the only locksmith I use from now on.</review>

< Review>
The locksmith Gary responded within 30 minutes of my call, provided a fair price for re-keying locks and made extra keys. Excellent service!  I highly recommend All City Locksmith for your locksmith needs.</Review>

<text>Not only did he show up quickly but he managed to fix everything in a matter of minutes. As a college student working part time I was very worried when half of my key broke off and got stuck in the ignition. Not only was the process easy and quick but it was incredibly affordable. The quote he gave me literally half the price of competitors. Great guy, great service, would 100% recommend!!<//text>< pics>

My old key broke inside the lock and it was my only access to my office building. I panicked and rushed to yelp to find a local locksmith. I was worried of how much this was going to cost me but I had no other choice. I called Gary at All City and he came incredibly quick, worked his magic and got me back inside. He re-keyed the doors and priced the job very reasonably. I have found my go-to locksmith! Thanks so much Gary!< /Text>

I called All City Locksmith to rekey my residence. He showed up and got to work, didn’t waste his or my time. Because of that I had to call him out a second time to rekey the business. Same experience second go around. Showed up and got the job done with no problems. Will definitely call back when needed</text>

My key fob broke on my car and I called to get a quote on a new one. The owner was so helpful and even suggested I could probably fix it by googling the problem. Please support this business they are very honest :)< /Review>

< Review>
Just had Gary from All City Locksmith out to rekey and he did an excellent job. He was quick and efficient and the price was excellent. We just moved into the neighborhood and we asked around for a locksmith. All City came highly recommended and I can see why. Great work! We will be calling them for all our key needs for sure.< /Review>

<review>I called All City Locksmith to rekey my residence. He showed up and got to work, didn’t waste his or my time. Because of that I had to call him out a second time to rekey the business. Same experience second go around. Showed up and got the job done with no problems. Will definitely call back when needed</review>< rate>

Gary helped me save a lot of money fixing my car key which is a fraction of what I will pay if I have to go to dealership. Hardwares can’t replace or even fixed my car key.

Thanks Gary. Now I can confidently give my key to my friend who will drive me on my old Honda CRV going to the church. No more shabby looking car key 🔑🙏🏻.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

When I noticed I locked my keys in my car I was really concerned about how much it would cost or whether I would be scammed. Thankfully I chose All City Locksmith and their price for the unlock was reasonable and they were quick. Gary was really friendly and professional, I would definitely recommend their services to friends.<//Review>

Can't open my door as my key got stuck in the lock. Search online and found good reviews of All City Locksmith. it was 5:00 pm and its website said its closed. I just tried to call and Gary answered my call promptly. After only 20 minutes, he was in my home and fixed everything. Great service and great price. Gary is very polite and nice.< /review>

FAST, EFFICIENT, REASONABLE

Gary's same day service for a nine lock re-key was performed in a logical, efficient manner, taking less than an hour to complete!.

Gary was also very generous with his explanation of what his was doing, while executing the re-keying process.

And the cost...I was expecting at least double the cost of what he charged!

As an owner/operator, Gary was able to accept business calls, answer questions, while performing my re-keying project. A FANTASTIC multi-tasker!

The entire process was worthy of 10 stars!<//Review>

I was moving into a new home and needed fast affordable service to rekey all the locks in the home.  I contacted Gary and was able to setup for a 3pm that same day service after verifying my address and proof of residency.  He arrived on site and was able to remove a very old lock and rekey all the other door locks for a very reasonable price.

I had previously reached out to check other locksmiths for price and service including AAA recommended locksmiths which were all more expensive but Gary was able do everything and more for the same price he originally qouted me.  It's hard to find good quality service for a reasonable price. \I will be happy to recommend him to family, friends and use Gary for all my future lock issues.

He saved me about $75 in new locks by just rekeying (new keys, not replacments but he does that too) instead of replacing the whole complete locks unecessarily.

Thanks again Gary!</review>

Had to change locks on my home and could not wait one or more days.  Everyone was giving me 24 to 48 hour wait.  All City answered the call and was out in 20 minutes.  Changed 5 locks for half the price of the other locksmiths.  Keeping them in my speed dial.< /Review>

<Review>We recently moved out to Rancho Cucamonga and needed change out the locks on the house.  After pricing new locks, we decided to go with re-keying the house instead.  Being new in the area, we didn't know who to call and we had no recommendations.  I found this guy on Yelp and decided to take a chance (as with any new service).  Gary answered my call promptly and scheduled an appointment to re-key my house within a couple hours of calling him.  He showed up on time and did a fantastic job!  Extremely professional and very reasonable pricing.  Highly recommended! - Thanks Gary!!<//Review></record>

<Review>We needed rekeys to our new house and Gary went above what we had originally agreed on. He had the best price among all the other locksmiths I had called in the area and still gave excellent  service. Will definitely call him again when we need a locksmith...and will gladly recommend him to our friends.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1450474960594, 'text': 'Thanks for reviewing and using our services\nAll City Locksmith'}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3363be0523d59:0x20120dac7174fbc8<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Update 3/17/2018

Gary is back at it again with quick service and great attitude.  He was able to provide me with a quote over the phone and came by 20 minutes  after hanging up.

Thank you Gary!

-------Previous review--------

Gary was great.  I called to get a quote and he did it over the phone, he was able to come over right away and finished rekeying 6 locks within an hour.  He was a very friendly guy and worked quickly.  Also his prices are lower than other locksmiths I called even with their coupons.

If you need a locksmith don't hesitate to call All city locksmith!<//text>

< Review>
Great service on a stressful day! We decided to change our locks on the day we moved into our new home, Gary met us at our new home, was early, and was very helpful. It was very busy with the movers working at the same time, but Gary was very accomodating and worked around us. More importantly, he was really pleasant and understanding. He even took a door handle off for me that wasn't even where he was working and refused to let me pay him for it. Fantastic service and a bright spot on an otherwise stressful day. I recommend Gary without reservation!<//Review>

I was looking all over the internet for a trustworthy locksmith, until I bumped into All City Locksmith. I called for services of rekeying my front door lock, of the home I moved into. Gary who answered was polite and informative, and was able to come out the same day I called wasting no time. Real cool guy. He saw my lock, and knew exactly what to do. He even went the extra step of making all the locks (only two) match the same key. So that I don't have different keys to get into my house. He was fast, nice and pleasant. I truly do recommend him for any of your locksmith needs. I'm just a regular guy who found a great locksmith. I hope this helps with your decisions. Take care and God bless.<//review>

<text>I locked myself out of the house yesterday (3/27/17), no house/car keys - I know,  I know!  My spares were locked up, I needed to get to work, and my HO Insurance company was no help! I called a couple well known places in the Riverside area... They all wanted $90 and up... And they could be there within a FEW hours!

So went on another site/app and found a couple places, sent out requests; got a couple instant responses but they wanted more than $100 & it would be to 2-4 hours before they could come.  Then along came Gary & All City!  He was able to give me a quote that was FAR below everyone else's (almost half)  AND he said he could be there within about an hour!!! I thought it was too good to be true... but NO additional fees, charges,  mileage/travel costs... and he accepts cards!

I just texted him my address & a picture of the lock.  From there he provided updates on his location/arrival time,  right until he pulled up to the house.  I'll include a snapshot of the messages. I contacted him around 8:30a.. he was finishing another job and heading over by 8:46a... and was at the house before 9:30!!!

When he arrived he was nice & polite, but worked quickly!! Amazingly quick!!! The price never changed and I was on my way to work within an hour!!!

As you'll see from the screenshot, I've  already added his number to my phone for future reference.  He really came through when I was in panic mode & dreading this unexpected expense.  He's hardworking, friendly, honest & reliable!  Locksmith needs??... CALL GARY!!!

And NO, I'm not a friend/relative and had never used his services until yesterday. It's just difficult & rare to find companies/people like this! :)<//text><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

Went to Pepboys, Walmart, Home Depot, and etc. to get an extra key for my vehicle. None of them had it. Called the dealership and they gave me a quote, then I called Gary and he gave me a far better one. Showed up to my house and did the work on about 5 minutes. Couldn't have been happier. Great price, incredible convenience.<//text>

{'time': 1425702537694, 'text': "Yes, I removed the lock because you didn't pay me. Instead, you kept playing games, saying you lost your checkbook in the mail? You manage Victorias Secret (a trillion dollar company) how on earth could you have no money in your bank? Then, you come up with even more excuses, saying, we need a company order faxed in, and a worker approve the work before we can pay you, plus we don't have any $ to pay you. Yet the store was crowded with a line of customers. If I would have known this first, I would have never taken this job.\n\nAt the end of the day, I was promised pay, which didn't happen. I tried calling and texting Monty, but, this time he didn't answer. Yes, I  took the lock off and was very happy that I did it. You tried making a fool out of me, but it didn't work out so well for you, so all you can do is give me a 1 star rating. Shame on you.\n\nThe next morning all of a sudden there is money in their bank account (Somehow his checkbook was never lost, but was playing me all this time to work for free) I rejected his payment. I don't do business like that and don't want your business in the future.\n\nI deal with many people, I would have never thought in a million years that Victorias Secret would pull something shady like this.\n\nWho's unprofessional and breaking the law now??"}</resp>

< Review>
Terrible, complete lack of professionalism, I called him from out of state to replace a lock on a door at a store I manage and because I didn't pay him within a few hours with my credit card he went back to the store and removed the lock....which is against the law!  Now he refuses to return my call and I am paying someone else to do his job after I paid him in full without knowing he had removed the lock< /Review>

Gary came out the same day to Rekey our New Home and we was really happy with his service. He Rekeyed a total of 12 doors in about an hour. He also installed a new mailbox lock as we never got any keys for our mailbox. I was very happy with his service and same day appointment. If you need a locksmith to rekey your home then Call All City Locksmith, you can't go wrong.< /text>

10/10, LIVV was absolutely phenomenal! I’m a first time patient and was greeted, seated, onboard and hooked up to an IV in about 1/5th the time it would haven taken me to get a Starbucks coffee. The staff is professional, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, and the space is so comfortable with a great vibe and music. The overall experience was more like a five star retreat than a wellness center. Will definitely be coming back!< /Text>

<text>I LOVE LIVV!  The staff is so friendly and accomodating, their location is prime, the venue is aesthetic, and all the IVs work miracles on me.  I've tried their revive, energy and immune IVs and they all work wonders.  10/10 need to come here.< /text>< Resp>

I see Dr. Zand for my very complicated chronic illnesses. He is amazing! Dr. Zand is highly knowledgeable, very present and kind and understanding. I completely trust him with my health care, he breaks down the lab results and always helps me understand them and what our next plan of action is. I appreciate getting to see Dr. Phan around at LIVV he is always so welcoming.</Review>< Date>

I went a little over a month ago to see Dr. Phan for PRP injections for my knee and back after various sports injuries, and it has been life changing! I now experience little to no pain after suffering daily pain for 9 years straight! Would highly recommend going to see Dr. Phan! He and his staff are so welcoming and I can't wait to go again!<//Text>

<review>I googled Best IV Vitamin therapy in San Diego, here the first recommended place was LIVV Little Italy, and man how glad I am i found this place. The staff , the environment, and the services was beyond perfect. The doctors were so kind and welcoming, they made sure they answered all of questions and more. And on top of all this perfection; I didn't feel any pain when the doctor inserted the needle for the IV VITAMIN. I’m hooked for life now, it's been almost a week and I feel so good, my energy levels are over the roof top, my mood is beyond amazing and also I can't wait to go back and just enjoy the experience all over again. I am so glad LIVV Little Italy and their doctors exist. Thank you doctors and staffs for such an amazing experience.<//review><rating>5<//rating><pics>None</pics><user>113021201504710537103<//user>< gmap_id>

<Text>With the pandemic going on I figured it would be a great idea to keep my body healthy. I came to my favorite spot LIVV! As soon as your walk in you’re greated and asked if you want water or tea. The atmosphere is extremely peaceful and everyone is super nice. I would recommend LIVV to anyone looking to get back to feeling their best. Enjoy!</Text>< pics>

<Review>I’m completely hooked! My friend has been getting IVs for months and keeps raving about them. They had a special for a free small bag, so I went with her and gave it a shot. It was simple and easy and everyone was really nice. Afterwards, I felt *AMAZING*! I literally have not felt that good in years. It gave me a lot more energy and improved my mood, which was an unexpected benefit. I’m back 10 days later for another one and imagine i‘ll keep coming back. :)</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I was searching for an IV Therapy Center.  I found LIVV on Instagram.  I was impressed with the marketing and services that were available.    I met Mel first talked to her about coming in then I walked in on my birthday on 5/12.  I received excellent services.  I was able to get a FULL consultation and treatment.  All this during Shelter in Place.  I also want to mention Dr. Kellen Shade.  She was amazing.  She made me a delicious cup of hot tea.  And was able to answer all my questions.  Thank you so much Dr Kellen.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

If you're feeling sick, give the cold buster a try! The cold buster is the real deal and made me a huge believer in IV therapy. Stopped the cold right in its tracks. Nearly all my symptoms went away after my IV and came back home with a lot more energy. Next time I get sick, I'm definitely coming in for a cold buster.<//Review>

Beautiful new space in Little Italy run by knowledgeable and caring medical professionals. I have gotten two IVs from both Dr. Phan and Dr. Black. They made the process painless, comfortable and very enjoyable. Felt great after both and will definitely be continuing treatments. Their philosophy on health and wellness will help you be the best version of yourself and make sure all your systems are functioning at optimal levels.<//Review>

LIVV has everything from an amazing office and team to great services and products. I came in for an IV bag and left with a few great natural products -- one of which was called "Soul Drops" -- amazing! They offer free health consultations that I strongly advise taking advantage of next time you stop by!</Review>

<Name>Colte Cavaretta</Name><date>1530233812833<//date><rate>5<//rate><text>LIVV is where it’s at! This is the first doctor I’ve encountered that actually listened to what I had to say and discussed my issues in depth before reaching for any prescription pad. When it had seemed to me that most of the doctors I’ve visited were either working overly efficiently to meet strict insurance quotas or were only writing prescriptions for the sponsored drug of the day, I had to try something different, and that difference was LIVV! As an athlete, I want my body to operate as optimally as possible, and the team at LIVV really broke down, in detail, what it will take for me to do just that. I would recommend LIVV to everyone, but especially to those that want to take their health seriously!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I had such a wonderful experience, my friend referred me and said to ask for Dr Jason Phan. I went in to explore and research more information on the different IV therapies they provide (I ended up having the LIVV Energy IV with the Glutathione booster). Dr. Jason and the team are very personable and approachable; they went into great detail about the different treatments they offer. This facility is warm, welcoming, and beautiful aesthetically with a comfortable atmosphere to be yourself.< /Review>

< Review>
I went to visit Jason last week to get some blood work done and do an IV therapy session.
I have to say it's one of the best things I've done. As a health coach it's important to me to feel good. Jason helped me to go over my labs and establish a baseline so when I check in future months I can see how I'm doing. A lot of times we self medicate with supplements and things which I know form experience is not smart. I'm happy to have someone to bounce ideas off of and help me on my journey.
Also if you are in the area and can do an IV treatment, then do it! It's a game changer....
Jason is honest, practical and well informed.
Thank you<//Review>

Such an amazing space of healing! The IV vitamin drips are the best in town. Feel a rush of energy immediately. I travel a lot for work so the revive bag is great for jet lag and when I’m hungover. LIVV is the best IV Lounge in San Diego. Definitely recommend & refer all of my friends and family to LIVV.< /Text>

<review>LIVV is the top IV lounge in San Diego. From the people that work there, to the fun and energetic atmosphere they provide, to the treatments, everything is top notch. I was able to get everything I wanted and more. I will be coming back again very soon and I highly reccomend to anyone to try LIVV!

Dr. Jay and crew are the best.<//review>< pictures>

This was my first IV experience outside of a hospital and I have to say I was very impressed. The team at LIVV was very accommodating and made me feel like I was at my own home. Take a look at the pictures of the space and then check them out in person.</Review>

The blend of vitamins and nutrients he gave me has made me feel 100x better than IVs I've received from other doctors and his ability to stick my tricky veins on the first try has made me a forever patient at LIVV. He's quick, professional, and even offers house calls! A great solution for anyone with nutrient deficiencies or a hangover from one too many tequila shots the night before!<//Review>< Pics>

I highly recommend LIVV Natural! Dr. Phan is great and gave me all the information I needed to make me feel very comfortable. I received an IV made with various vitamins and minerals and the day after I felt energized, focused and an overall sense of well-being. I’m definitely going back for another one!< /review>

If you want the most effective and ground-breaking regenerative medicine, then you come and get treated by Dr. Phan! While training jiu-jitsu, I was SLAMMED on my shoulder and heard a loud POP! I was scared of looking at the damage that had been done (dislocations or compound fractures are no joke), but I was lucky to walk away with just a severe AC sprain and excruciating pain when moving my arm above my head. I did not want to resort to pain killers or surgery as options to treat the pain, which is why I chose Prolotherapy. After getting just a few treatments, I was able to return to training, at full capacity, in about a month! Thanks to Dr. Phan, I am able to lift weights and continue to train in mixed martial arts without any pain in my shoulder whatsoever! Dr. Phan is the only person I trust to treat my injuries, which is why he will be the first doctor I recommend if my friends, training partners, and, especially my daughter, were to sustain any debilitating injuries.<//text>

After much research on IV therapy I decided to try LIVV and I highly recommend. As a full time working mom in a doctoral degree program I needed an energy boost. I was easily able to book an appointment and immediately notice the difference in my energy level and ability to focus. You can easily book your appointments online with helpful reminders. I strongly recommend!</review>

Came in for a PRP Facial with Dr. Black & it really was a great experience. Dr. Black was super knowledgeable about the whole process & explained it every step of the way. It was only a week ago so still waiting to see full results for the PRP facial but so far I have noticed a lot of my deep hormonal acne sorta come to the service & go away! OH- & the spa is SO chic!!!< /review>

Dr. Jay is amazing! He came over to my place and hooked me up with an IV concoction that got me feeling strong and alive again. His professionalism and skills with the needle are on point. I didn't feel a thing with the needle.

IV nutrients are something we all need since our food sources these days have less nutrients than ever before. My body took that IV bag down so fast!  I will definitely be calling Dr. Jason Phan for more IV therapy.</Text>

Dr. Jason is the best around. I get weekly IVs from him and that helps me have energy to go accomplish everything I want to do. If I skip a week I definitely can tell the difference.

The cutest trendiest doctors office I’ve ever been to! Whether you’re popping in for a quick B12 pick me up shot, a larger more hydrating IV for an upcoming event or need more personalized one on one time for a complicated health problem livv will meet you where you’re at and help fulfill your needs!!! I was doctor shopping for over 10 years with GI and scary progressive mental symptoms with no luck before finally getting some answers and direction from the NDs here!

Their space is very open and naturey which is essential for healing and a relaxing time/experience at your doctors with smaller rooms for more private or personalized procedures/problems!</text>

I went to see Dr. Phan today because I felt very tired and had little energy. I felt like I was coming down with the flu. Dr. Phan suggested an IV treatment and it was really amazing!  I felt better immediately as I was so dehydrated!  Dr. Phan knew exactly what I needed to feel better. Everyone there was very friendly and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Phan and LIVV. I'm looking forward to my next visit and definitely recommend their IV treatments.</Review>

When I was in the process of recovering from a brutal upper respiratory infection, and no antibiotics seemed to be working miracles quick enough, I turned to a more holistic approach, and sought the help of Naturopathic Medicine. There is a crazy statistic that 90% of consumers read online reviews before visiting a business. My thorough research happened upon Dr. Jason Phan of LIVV IV Lounge – owner of 58+ glorious (5.0) star reviews. The proof is in the pudding, as they say, and social proof was enough for me to give LIVV IV Lounge a chance. Dr. Phan offers many services- from facials to IV drips and everything in between. I booked an appointment, which was a seamless process, and when the date of my appointment came, the check-in process was just as seamless. Upon entering LIVV Lounge you are greeted by an aura of calm and tranquility. The receptionist is more than attentive, offering you a unique blend of tea while you wait for your consultation with Dr. Phan to begin. I had no idea of what treatment to start with, so I relayed to Dr. Phan a detailed synopsis of all my bodily aches and symptoms. It was amazing- he doesn’t take notes using pen and paper; He mentally takes notes. He listens to every. single. word you have to say, and he remembers. As the prescribed course for my treatment he recommended the IV Hydration Therapy. He even went as far to customize my very own IV bag. I’ve always had an aversion to needles, but Dr. Phan and his team are adept at inserting your IV, so you don’t. feel. a. thing. It’s remarkable! I sat there comfortably, listening to relaxing music on the overhead, and sipping my tea. Thirty minutes or so passed, my IV Drip was complete, and I was sad for it. I didn’t want to leave! I left LIVV Lounge truly feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and with more of a pep in my step compared to how I was prior to this appointment. This will certainly not be my last visit. Even if you’re healthy or battling cold/flu season, Dr. Phan and his remedies can make you feel revived! I look forward to my next visit soon!</review>

<Review>I have been seeing Dr. Phan for nutrient IVs and I feel amazing. He is professional, caring, and patient centered. I can't say enough about him! I have been feeling run down and tired due to stress and overwork. The nutrient IV's give me the boost I need and help fortify my diet to ensure I am getting enough of the good stuff in. I immediately feel more calm and relaxed after the IV (I get extra magnesium=chill out IV). I love LIVV :)</Review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

10am, called about an IV, within 30 minutes they were at my AirBNB. The doctor had everything in a petite backpack, had me fill out a form on a tablet and administered the IV in ~20 minutes. They even customized the IV as I requested. 10/10 experience and will repeat next time I'm in San Diego.</Review>

Going to LIVV is an experience that will leave you refreshed. I've gotten the PRP vampire facial and my acne scars have greatly reduced and the built up collagen has diminished fine lines. I also used PRP in my crown area for hair regrowth- what up Stamos hair. If you don't know what PRP is then ask Dr. Jay... he's very informative and i'm sure it can help you in ways you don't know. The POLY MVA bag is the move if you're sick.  Just go- thank me later.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Amazing! I was utilizing Many homeopathic options to try to stabilize my adrenal fatigue and especially my severe lack of energy, with very little reprieve. After my first visit with Livv I felt more renewed, stabilized and energized than I had felt in five years!! (I felt like I did before I had children!) Lol, about 10 minutes after the Immunity cocktail and Dr. Black’s delicious,  Balance tea, I literally felt like I could have skipped down the street! I’ve been an enthusiastic and a fan ever since.

The entire staff is attentive, patient, informative and genuinely cares for their patients, PLUS their extremely steady hands are a bonus. I absolutely love and appreciate the clean LIVV lifestyle brand, and what their team works and lives for.

I’ve visited them for three amazing sessions so far, and I’ve yet to find any other homeopathic teas, tinctures, supplements, diets, etc. that have had a fraction of the immediate benefit for me. And I look forward to my future appointments. Please check their beautiful facility out and try it for yourself.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01b8e80c5785:0xaea4c4adc6a528d8< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Jason Phan is fantastic! I was referred to him by someone who had similar back pain. Dr. Jay helped me tremendously. First by having my first PRP treatment he reduced my pain and made me feel like myself again and get back to the gym. I am excited to go back next month for my stem cell treatment which I am sure will remove the remainder aches and pains I have. LIVV IS THE BEST!< /review>

<text>I came to Dr. Phan by accident when a mutual friend overheard the shoulder pain and injuries I had been dealing with. Leading up to that point, I had undergone X-Ray’s, 2 MRI’s, and saw 3 different orthopedic surgeons. I was being told over and over the only way to correct my issues was to undergo a surgery called “Distal Clavical Resection” where the surgeon essentially shaved off mm’s of my clavical. To me, that wasn’t a long-term solution, but rather a bandaid that ignores the outlining issues. Dr. Phan introduces me to PRP Therapy, and it has forever changed the way I look at surgery and medicine. I have undergone 7 major injury related surgeries over the years, and it makes me wonder how many could have been avoided using PRP. Within 2 weeks of the injections, I was able to do daily tasks pain free again; things as simple as a push up or taking off my shirt. Within 4-6 weeks, I was 75% recovered and back in the gym after a 4-5 month hiatus. I had gone through a 2nd round of therapy 6 weeks after the 1st. Now, I am about 3 total months out from my 1st round, and 99% pain free through the day. In the gym, I am about 90% of where I was prior to the injury, and there is still time to heal from the therapy. I highly recommend Dr. Phan and the knowledge he is able to provide and recommend alternative, lesser known therapies that WILL help you avoid surgeries and outdated medical practices!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>5<//Rating>< username>

Brought my fiancée in after a shoulder dislocation in yoga two weeks ago. Dr. Phan performed an ortho exam and injected PRP (platelets/stem cells)

We had gone to our MD who recommended steroidal injections. Decided to go wit natural plasma injections. The doc is highly knowledgeable and helpful.

I also got an IV to boost immunity while I waited. We both left feeling confidant in this clinic.
Def would recommend LIVV Natural.< /review>

Have seen Jason multiple times now.  He has helped me by giving me glutathione injections and methyl B12 and methyl folate.

Jason is a great guy, very knowledgable, so every Tuesday I go to a friend's house where we all have him give us IV's for what we need and hangout.

I would recommend seeing him to get what you need.<//text>

Excellent service! I happened to be in the area and went in to see if they could replace one of my all weather tires meant to preform in snow (I take lots of trips to Washington state). I was surprised they even had it. The rep was professional and helpful. The new tire was on within 2 hours. Faster than I expected for a busy Saturday.< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>No better tire shop around. Showed up at 8am on Saturday with a possible leak in my rear tire. There was a ton of people in front of me but they got to my vehicle and had me out the door in under an hour. They found 2 nails in the tire, patched them up and sent me on my way after checking the rest of the tires.

This was all FREE. Oh, and they didn't try to sell me 5 tires. Tyler is the go to man at this highly reputable establishment. They keep this level of expertise and amazing service up, I'm never going anywhere else.</review><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>102172071587392060225<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x80d955c6a69f4c8b:0x18cc642188eb80b1</gmap_id><Name>S.

Discount Tire to the rescue!!
First I think there was a technical glitch for online appointment setting on the website. It kept on saying my phone number was invalid. So I called, "We do take walk ins, and so I did.  Much to my surprise,  I was greeted warmly by one of the salesman. I went for removal of two screws. Instead of hearing a long story, the associate check my paperwork and informed me the roadside protection covered the tire. It could not be repaired, so per the contact the tire was replaced, no questions asked. The work took approximately 20 minutes which included my free rotation. It take a lot to impress me, JOB WELL DONE GUYS!! I WAS IMPRESSED...<//review>

<text>These guys are great.  They matched a great price on an excellent tire.  I brought some new tpms sensors and they installed them.  Even though and installer forgot to install one, I called and they took care of me and were amazingly friendly about it.  Service is everything and these guys were stellar!!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Clean & professional looking shop. Good pricing on tires. Obviously it depends on what brand of tires you want. Remember you get what you pay for. I would definitely recommend this place<//Review>

These guys took me in last minute on a Friday night when I found a screw in my tire. The staff is so kind, friendly, and extremely helpful. They took care of my car in such a timely manner as well. I definitely recommend their services. I will be a returning  customer.< /Text>

<text>I love Discount Tire!!! Great prices, better service, and even faster turnaround time. I had an emergency incident on the freeway where part of my tire had delaminated and and flown off, exposing the steel belt, and it was losing pressure quickly. This location was closest to me, so I stopped in right away. Within seconds, I was greeted by Jeremy, who had a very reassuring and calming, pleasant demeanor. He quickly assessed the situation and told me "let's go find the best tire for you, and I'll make sure its a great deal". Jeremy provided a few options and consulted me on the differences. Johnny was the technician, and he did a great job, quickly. I made sure to let Mike, the manager know the he has a great team and a great store. Overall, I'm sure every tire shop sells tires, but this Discount Tire location has great deals and truly distinguished service. Thank you for turning my day around and helping me so quickly!</text>< date>

GREAT Service!!!  I had low pressure in one of my tires and they found a nail in the side of one and replaced the tire with a new one for just  $23.  Since I purchased the tires there the rotation and balance was free!  The staff are great too! I left my cell phone at the desk and the service technician stayed 30min after closing so I could return and get it.  Thanks so much Daniel!!!  Discount Tire is the best!</Text>

Its a flagship tire store . It's very very expensive. WALLMART is cheaper. Yes they are fast to wait on you with tire sales , but if you need a hole in your tire fixed they will tell you to leave it , or to wait a few hours , like they have told me on many different occasions.They make it uneasy for you as possible so you leave and get it fixed else where. The waiting area OUTSIDE is gone , yes it's gone no more chairs out side .I am aware we must practice social distancing and outside they had the space to do this so why take the chairs away and keep the ones inside. This makes no sense at all. And it was 96 degrees when I went so sitting outside would of been nice !! This is the one on Mission Gorge Rd. by Interstate 8 !!! Be Aware !!!<//text>

Came in, and decided I needed to just replace all four to be safe, they had me out the door with four new tires for an extremely good price in under 40 minutes, and that was with them being relatively busy as well. The customer service is fantastic. Their prices are wonderful. They really know how to take care of their customers.<//review>< Pictures>

I was impressed by the /excellent/ service here compared to /pretty good/ service at other Discount Tire locations. I was first helped by Fausto, who was extremely friendly, compassionate, and helpful.

I arrived in the early afternoon on a Thursday with a sidewall bubble on one tire and another tire completely flat. I had my car back within twenty minutes.</text>

<review>I really appreciated discount tire for fixing my tire for free. I got a flat tire because of two nails, and I brought the car to Costco tire center. They said they were not able to fix it, and that I have to buy a new tire which they didn’t carry. Then I called Discount Tire to ask if they have the model of my tire. Francisco answered the call. He’s very thorough and asked a few questions about the car. Then instead of ordering the new tire for me, he suggested me to bring the car in so that they can take a look to see if it’s fixable. I am so glad I listened to him. They were very quick and friendly. They took out the nails, fixed my tire, and made sure the air pressure is balanced, then put the donut tire back in the trunk! The whole process was less than 1 hour. Thank you so much for the awesome service! I’ll for sure to come back if I have any issue with tires in future. Highly recommended!</review><date>1564444313172</date><UserId.>101009689598232686590</UserId.>< Pictures>

<review>Probably won’t bring back a manual car to this location after watching one of the staff members almost smash my rear bumper into the curb. Other that this the service was quick but left me with an uneasy feeling like if I didn’t tell the guy to hop out and stop grinding the gears on my car it could’ve been really bad. Thankfully one person in the shop knew what a manual transmission was. Thank you for not crashing my car ginger guy! You deserve a raise 🙏</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>I just don't get why anyone would by a tire anywhere else. The service is always so great, and yet the prices are always the lowest (The sign next door at Evans Tires that says "we beat discount is 100% BS). Discount even beats Costco on price. And it beats the F out of Evans and anyone else from head to toe.

I've been had dealings with probably about 10 of the locations over the years. This store is typical Discount Tire - customer service above all else. This last stop was my third at this location. I lease cars for a year at a time now, and no longer buy tires for myself. I do buy tires for my kids regularly.

Yesterday, I stopped in to have a new tire fixed. Not a new tire I bought from Discount, but one on a relatively new car. I wasn't asked if I bought the tire there, and they did not know me from previous business I had done with Discount. They fixed my tire for free, checked and adjusted the tire pressure in the other three, and had me on my way in 30 minutes. Why? Because that's what Discount Tire does. No upsell, no pitch, just a smile and when I asked why it was free, the response was "we can't have people driving on dangerous tires" :)

So two messages:

1) You're crazy if you buy tires anywhere else. Costco somewhat excepted, but you won't get this kind of service. That only applies to tires btw, Costco rocks.

2) FY Evans Tires. There is no measurable value you beat Discount at anything. Not even price, which is the insinuation. But you did rip my son off one time very cleverly!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Their customer service is on another level.. Fernando is great, helpful and easy to work with. There was a mix up on the web order and their inventory but he offered solutions and was simply easy to work with.

Sean the manager was great as well! Very quick to make a decision and keep the whole process easy! Thank you guys again this is our 2nd time using you and we will be back to this location!</text>

The service is welcoming and they make appts so you don't have to wait long at all. Their warranty is excellent & their customer service is really great. I loved working with Jessica &  the gentleman who worked on my car brought me the keys and we shook hands. For  my money, they can't be beat.! I'm a first timer but won't go anywhere else for my tire needs. I would recommend them to everyone.<//review>

I just had my third flat tire in eight months, so I've seen a lot of these guys lately.  They are friendly, efficient, fair and honest.  Oh yeah and did I mention fast?  The first two times I needed a new tire.  Today the tire just needed to be repaired....and they did it for free.  Help me find the problem here.  :)</Text>

Went here to get a flat tire repaired. Discount Tire takes really good care of their customers. The wait was a little long but they told us that when I called and when we arrived. So it was not a surprise. They were busy and the wait made sense. We had time to get something to eat and by the time we were done, our car was ready. Great customer service and they honor their warranty. We have been and will remain loyal customers because of that!<//review>

<Text>I was just looking for a simple two tire change I know personally it doesn’t take long and know there’s people ahead of me, never go to Walmart or any other shop that makes you “wait like everyone else” said the guy from Walmart, 3 to 4 hours??? I laughed and looked up the closest discount tire knowing I could trust them, sure enough I found one close to where I was an headed there. Fernando at discount helped me out, showed me some new tires for the trailer and had them on in 5 minutes. I never write reviews but great service calls for one. Thank you Fernando and the staff and discount tire for being always trustworthy and fast so we have time for enjoy the rest of the day! Thank you!< /Text>< Name>

<Text>They were great! I ran over a nail which caused a flat and brought my car with it's spare on the next day. I was thinking maybe a whole new tire? They ended up repairing my old one and it was done in about 20 minutes, and I didn't even have an appointment!! Also, it was free!! So amazing! Will not go anywhere else for tires! Fast, Friendly, overall amazing service!

I took my car because it was losing pressure slowly. When I got there, they showed me another tire that was not mine and said that it could not be fixed, it looks like it is permanently there for that reason. Again they tried to take off the tire from the other side that I did not request i had to stop them. Eventually I am shown my tire with a big cut, which looked like it could not last more than an hour, while it had a slow leak that lasted all night. I had warranty and just replaced the tire though it looked like they tempered with it.

I can't trust this guys with my car again. You have to watch them closely and I can only imagine if I wasn't there, I guess I would have had to replace 2 tires.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>After 25 years of only using discount tire I will never be back. I went to this location about 2 months ago for a flat during a rough financial time. I went to discount tire, though it was my first time at this location, I have used discount tire my whole life in many other states. The manager here was reluctant to patch my flat and get me on the road. Instead he told me “you haven’t bought anything here in awhile, so this is the last time we will fix it for free”. Considering I have maxed my discount tire credit line of $2500 multiple times throughout my life I was offended. That is why I will NEVER use this company again. From now on I’ll use their competitor Evans tire. Unless I find out they are owned by the same people.< /Review>< pics>

<review>It was a very smooth transaction. I had an appointment at 8:30 and got there like 5 til and left at 9:18. A little longer than I expected but it turned out fixing my flat was a no go and I ended up buying a used tired for a few cents under $40. They had coffee but I don't drink coffee.<//review>< pictures>

The worst place I have never seen, in like 3 weeks before I bought 2 tires and they told me these are guaranteed tires in case if they don’t work you can bring them back and we replace them during one month,so one tire just damaged without any reason and I came here I told them this is the tire and it didn’t work at least one month so the guy told me we can’t do anything about it. And if you want buy a new one and it cost 56$ for me,  so finally I told him ok put a new one but I’m not satisfied because the first day you guys talked to me differently than now. It’s ok I hope God judge.</text>

Solid service and prices. Randy helped me out and didn't try to "oversell"  or push things, but he did give honest advice and options and let me decide what was best.  With the appointment for installation, I was in and out in about 45 minutes,  just enough time to grab a quick snack next door (plenty places adjacent for food).<//Text>

<text>I had a horrible experience last time I purchased tires from his location. I bought a good set of four tires running me about 700. I got Discount to align my car as well, where they had to take my car to a mechanic near by. When I got my car back after them having it all day my tires were so off balance that I could barely drive my car 65. I had to take it back the next day and get the tires balanced again. They said that the tires were very off balance and that it was their fault. It's like they completely forgot to balance them! Then I came to discover that the air valve covers that came with my rims were missing. They put on generic black air valve covers which look horrible. I'm really disappointed in my experience at this location and I plan to either do my business at a different location or another tire company all together in the future.</text>< Name>

So I headed right over and was greeted by Jonny, he was very friendly. He took a look at my tires and told me I really should have them changed because the back two were 12 years old. I have very limited funds, but he was concerned about my car being safe so he offered me a great deal and put nice, used, tires on all 4 wheels. I was surprised and very grateful for the offer. Thanks guys!!<//Text>< Pics>

Very happy with the professionalism and excellent service I always receive from this company. I will always buy my tires from discount tire even if I hear of lower prices at other retailers.<//Review>

I refuse to go anywhere else for tires. Been coming here for 20+ years and even when I moved away from the area (even when I was in LA) I would come back to this location to get tires. John (mgr) is one of the best in the business...he could write a book on how to care for a customer.</Review>

Other than a small misunderstanding of placement of tires, not too bad of a place. Employees are highly generous, they are also happy to answer any questions you may have and will walk through any issues or concerns with you.<//text>

However just bought a new car and and hit curb Sat on way to work, went over to discount to have tire repaired or replaced.  after parking my car and getting out to walk inside the guys straight shut the roll up doors on me......I am still stunned and shocked...nice way to treat a preferred customer.  As one of the owners of the company I do not want to give them another dollar of our hard earned money.  Customer Service is everything.  We bend over backward every day for every customer.... I still cant believe it....seriously how rude...All I needed was a tire repair.    As a business owner I have lost count of the times Ive went out of my way to make sure customer is happy....</text>< pics>

They replaced it for free, just had to pay less than $16 to warranty the new one. There was a long wait that day as there were 4 others there for the same reason. All the other times I'm in and out with in the hour. Customer service is totally on point at this location.<//Review>< GmapID>

Pretty darn efficient and they keep your automotive history accurately. The tires are actually cheaper but better quality than a few years ago as oil prices are cheaper now.</Review>

Have been coming here for over 10 years.  Would not imagine ever going anywhere else.  Stay away from their neighbor, Evans Tire.  Any company what has to hang a sign that they will beat their neighbors price isn't a business you want working on your.<//text>

Something about those egg McMuffin's... I got the coffee I forgot about the coffee. Ask them for a regular coffee with eight and eight. That's eight sugars and eight creamers and then tell them you want them to mix it for you. That way you don't have to do it in your car.once you take that first sip you will understand why I love it so much.<//Text>

<Text>Last night was probably the first time to ever get serviced quickly at drive thru within 5 mins, usually we are in line for a while so that was an improvement.

You can never go wrong with some Mcdonald Chicken Nuggets and fries. I stopped by this Mcdonald location because it was on my way back home. When I pulled into the drive thru, there was only 3 cars in front of me so I thought it would be a quick drive thru. But unfortunately the car in the front ordered like 7 meals so it held up the line. Their hand 2 windows at this Mcdonald location, the first one is where you pay and the second one is where you get your food. They give me a lot of ketchup without even asking so that's always nice. The chicken nuggets and my 2 large fries hit the spot for my dinner. I was very happy with my dish.<//review>

< Review>
I was there late, near closing time. Previous visits around the same time were not good, so I was surprised when I got home to find the burgers, fries, and nuggets were all warm, fresh and very tasty. So, thank you for making useful improvements that allowed me to enjoy my dinner and putting some faith that this McDonald's is trying to have customers enjoy the experience.< /Review>

waited 20 minutes in curbside pickup spot for a simple order while 4 cars who pulled up after me were served first and when my order was finally ready it was missing my cone bc the machine was being cleaned so she refunded me for it with a bag of quarters but I only got $1.25 and cones are $1.99< /Review>

This place has some of the laziest staff imaginable, but seems to fluctuate based on managers and shift crews. They frequently screw up orders, and go so far as to CANCEL UberEats orders for no apparent reason (the app updated my order status after the fact claiming that the restaurant is "closed"... At 6:30 p.m.). Seriously?<//Review>

Just not being one of the 24-hour drive-thrus I caught it at almost shut down time. The only person that I saw at the place was this very tired looking but very efficient girl with the name of Brittany who took my order...brought me my food and got it all right. I really am not a fan of McDonald's, but, this was the best experience i have ever had with this restaurant chain.</review>

Do you love flat coke? Do you love cold old fries? Do you love hamburgers that taste Ike they were made two weeks ago? Do you love speaking to employees who are rude and abrasive? Well then this is the perfect Mc Donald’s for YOU!</Review>

I went to McDonald’s this week and ordered a large chocolate shake for my son. I was charged the same price  I have always been charged for large shakes in the past. This time, I was given a small shake! I was told that that is the new large shake! Are they so hard up right now, they give half of the amount of food yet are charging the same amount? The week before I went the the same McDonalds and ordered chicken nuggets and french fries for my son. They forgot the French fries. Luckily I checked before I drove off. It was right on the receipt, so I had indeed paid for them. What a hassle! Every time I go something goes wrong and there is a problem  at the pickup window. A while back I ordered a mocha frappe. I was putting my money away as I drove to the window. I didn’t even have time to stop the car when the person at the window dropped  whole drink in my lap. He couldn’t even make sure I was holding it before letting go. It exploded all over the inside of my newly washed car! Is it any wonder that I really hate McDonalds and never plan to return again even if my son likes the food.?</text>

<text>They messed up my order not once but twice! Smh 🤦🏽‍♀️ first they give me a burger with stale burger buns and the second order they didn’t put the Mac sauce that I payed extra for? Come one get it together. And when I ask for a refund cause I knew they would mess up my order AGAIN! One of the workers was talking about another customer getting loud with her cause they messed up her order. What?? Lord fix her why would you “try” to talk about someone when you don’t listen and mess up their order in the first place? 🙄 people show don’t use their brains<//text>< Pictures>

Be aware that prices vary by location. This one is more expensive. Other locations are willing to ice decaf coffee for you but not here.</text>

McDonald's located on the South-West corner of Lassen and Balboa.  This location was recently renovated.  Parking lot is very poorly designed and spaces are incredibly tight.  Drive-through doesn't offer a lot of space to move around in.  There are two spots to park if your order isn't ready.  The interior is small and oddly laid out.  Mix of booths and tables, but not many of either.  Two video displays with games for kids to play.  Staff was decent, though a little confused (I asked for 2 water cups when I ordered and was told they'd be brought to my table; staff brought out 4 cups of water about half-way through my meal).  The floor wasn't filthy but it was also obviously not clean.  Food was par for the chain.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but I wouldn't avoid it if I was in the area and craving fries or McNuggets.<//Text>

Each McDonald's location is a different experience and that's why I review each I visit. This location is located within a few blocks from a University and is usually quite dirty on the inside as well as under staffed. Plenty of wasted floor space with very limited seating. Most of the seating is in an area my kids and I call restroom row. Constant foot traffic headed in and out of restrooms and coughing and/or sneezing all over your food or the tables while passing by. Two trips required by each passerby due to locked restroom. The shutting and opening of the restroom doors is similar if not actually more functional then having a working "fart fan" in those restrooms so trust me on this, bring a fume stopping gas mask/respirator for dining in this area. Problems within the bathroom are numerous and dont want to write a book on restrooms alone. The other huge problem here is trying to actually order food. The automated station is there along with the now typical 1 employee pushing you to use it but unable to speak a single word of english not related to items on menu. Told her repeatedly I don't want to finance my fast food items on either debit or credit cards because the machines dont take cash. Kept insisting I use. I guess you can order and pay cash at counter but the glitches in that system are countless. Insist on human cashiers everywhere you go. These machines are very capable of cash transactions and almost every where in use they dont accept cash. The reason... People living paycheck to paycheck and living off credit. That 9 dollar value meal every other day is making millions in interest charges and fees split between the stores and creditors. Pay attention and think. Don't finance fast food ever!! Will save you from bankruptcy later as well as a job for human cashiers. The frapes were not filled to top and fries cooked in dirty grease. Just a bad location in general..< /review>

I have a problem with many McDonald's. I'm a senior and the servers just aren't interested in me.  This property is a different story. The staff is excellent and always gets it right. The inside is clean and nice.  I drive past an other McDonald's to get here.  We'll done!</Review>

8 people in line. No one taking orders. Understaffed. Completely ignoring dine-in customers. Drive through customers got served though, apparently. Eventually gave up and went to a different McDonald's.</Review>

<Review>Hit and miss for me. Generally say fries with no salt and get salt packets to garuntee fresh fries. Their morning team has this really awesome African American cashier that I love interacting with. Otherwise, I've had orders wrong before. The store isn't corporate owned, so some of the deals you expect no longer apply, like the $1 Dollar drinks. Sigh.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>3< /Rate>< Time>

<Date>1535767692422< /Date><pics>None< /pics><Review>So upset with his McDonald’s.  I went yesterday for a yogurt parfait and they say they don’t have any. I go back today and use the drive-through and place my order. I ordered a yogurt parfait and a meal. Drive up to the pay window and payed for my order then took forever to drive to the pick up window 2 cars ahead of me. Finally I get to the pick up window get my meal and fry’s were cold. Waiting for the yogurt parfait then after waiting for a bit they tell me they don’t have any and if I wanted anything else and I said no. Didn’t even get my money back so I drove away.  Food cold , service slow they need to get it together!! Horrible service!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Sign on doors say they open at 5am.  I showed up at 5am for a business transaction to be told by a worker "we are closed."  I explained we were here to sign some paperwork and could wait before ordering food.  She turned around and walked away.  We were done at 5:25am.  Asked another worker if they were serving food yet and was told yes,  so I went to the counter to order.  After waiting 3 minutes and stared at by 4 different employees a distance behind the counter I gave up and left.  Never been treated so rudely.<//Review>

<Text>We ordered two meals but they only gave us one. We didn’t notice until we got home. And there’s no receipt in the bag so  we can’t go back and ask them to make it up to us. I am so disappointed.< /Text>< Pics>

Won't even tell you if there's more orders to come, the way they give your order at the drive through window they will say "here!". How rude! The Ice Cream Cone, they won't even use a napkin to grab the cone does not matter if there's a paper but that is unsanitary, they wipe their face and pants and won't use a napkin! Look inside the store trash is always full like overflowing near the paper towel holder! So unsanitary!! VERY POOR THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!< /text>< pics>

<Review>I love all the employees at this location. They are friendly, polite and helpful. The only complaint I have is that they need at least 1 or 2 employees just doing the McCafe. It doesn't matter if I park and walk in or drive thru. I have to wait 10-15 mins extra for my drinks. Today I did the drive thru my receipt says I placed the order at 10:36. I had to park 12 mins later an employee walked up with my order very sweet. I haven't tried the APP ordering and pick up yet That'll be the next test. I still love this location over Reseda and Nordhoff. Their McCafe never works.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>3</Rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

It's McDonald's. In a pinch for a quick on the go meal it suffices, but you will hate yourself after.<//text>

< review>
Unfortunately i had bad service at this McDonald's. One of the shift manager got upset because i requested more fries in my quite empty large french fry box. After demanding my money back or additional frys, the shift manager agreed to replace the order. After waiting 3 mintues i receive the same empty box. In addition  to the already frustrating visit the store manager showed no professionalism or concern to rectify the problem..< /review>
