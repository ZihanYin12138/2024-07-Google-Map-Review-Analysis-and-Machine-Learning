Wonderful experience. This place was not busy at all on a Saturday afternoon. I was seated immediately. Served immediately. I ordered and my food was out in less than 5 minutes.

I ordered the 🍤 and 🦀 veggie enchiladas. The dish came with beans and rice and a small sweet cornbread mix. It was so delish!!!! Wow. Everything was very tasty and flavorful!

I can’t to come back here again! Great service!<//Review>

Love the chips and salsa here find myself always taking some to have at home and the Mixed Grill Fajitas  brings so much it's easily split between two people. Tasty Carnitas great grilled chicken and can't get enough of the Tamalito< /Review>

<review>This is a nice location, employees are always very nice, food has always been delicious and everything has always been clean.
Parking usually isn't a problem, the large parking structure offers plenty of spots.
Weekends can become busy so don't expect to be seated right away. Week days are hit and miss but usually not too busy making it easier to get in and out quickly.
Overall it's a good restaurant with dependable service and food.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

<review>Fun atmosphere! Now that IKEA has closed down, the area is pretty dead, but you can go next door to Barnes and Noble for some more fun after dinner. Delicious fajitas. The chips taste a bit like oil but still good texture and salsa. Kids eat for $1 with the purchase of an adult entree on Wednesdays. Great happy hour options.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The service here was amazing! The hostess was easily the nicest person that works at any restaurant in Burbank, she checked in on us a few times and was over all glad to be at work.

The food was decent. Nothing was homemade but it was still good.<//Review>

<text>Family brought me here to try some of their good Mexican food, and I was pretty impressed! Their food was really good and the staff was overall really friendly. I did have a bit of an issue with the server staff. They seemed to be no where in site and visited little bit when they did, they did make it a priority to take care of our needs< /text><username>Zacchary Williams-Swartz<//username><Rate>4<//Rate><gmap_id>0x80c29544f42e7023:0xf13b07030b55adee</gmap_id>< pics>

Enjoyed a lovely get-together lunch with retired work friends. Dolores set up a table for us in the back of the restaurant which made it semi -private. Chris, our waiter was very accommodating in his service to the long table and even provided separate checks for everyone.  Food was delicious and we even were able to bring our own "retirement celebration" cake to share.< /text>

Just started coming to this place recently, but it's a pretty dope spot. Gotta show up for the happy hour, 3pm to closing every night. Great prices and a chill environment. Our server Brandon was the homie, really friendly and good energy. Definitely worth rolling through to rock a few drinks after a long day at work.</Text>

My wife and I decided to eat lunch at chevys and Theron was our server. I have to say Theron was very funny, and had a great personality. The food was great and had great prices. The only thing my wife and I didn’t like was the chip and salsa.</review>

Loved the happy hour margaritas and appetizers. The service was a bit slower but I'm still giving it a 5 star rating for the food and experience me and my wife had. We needed a date night ater a week long work and we got work unwind. We ordered the happy hour appetizers which include wings and mozzarella sticks.<//text>

But the secret is the salsa...my favorite salsa in the whole world, and that great salsa makes everything else taste twice as good.  Also the best chips in the world in my opinion; light and tasty.

Unfortunately the quality of the food and the Waite staff has been in slow decline. This used to be a phenomenal place to come and eat. Always worth a try but "buyer beware." This place however is great for taking in the game, the bar area and drinks/beers are great.< /text>

<text>I like coming here for the nachos and happy hour.  $4 margarita and the chicken nachos are awesome!  Definitely something to share since they are very big.  The servers are fast and constantly checking on you if you need anythign or if you are enjoying your meal.  Parking is very easy and has a great amount of foot traffic passing through the front.  They have a bar area with TV showing the current sport game as well as a heated patio area out front.

<Review>I'd give it 4 stars, but when my friend & I got there Friday evening (9pm) they quoted us a 20-25 minute wait & there was a pretty big crowd waiting. The problem for me is that there were more than a dozen empty tables in view, that just  needed bussing and nobody was being seated at all. Maybe just a bad night, I usually have a positive experience here.<//Review>< pics>

On my first visit April 2018 the restaurant was big, and friendly. The prices were higher than what I anticipated. Almost everything is $12.99, and uP😥< /Review>

The Service: Wonderful. Our server, Ruben, is super attentive and polite. He constantly check on us. The service is fast. Love the unlimited chips and salsa!!

The Food:

Jalapeño Bacon Wrapped Shrimp - Grilled shrimp wrapped in roasted jalapeño chiles, manchego cheese and bacon. Served with jalapeño jelly for dipping. You can never go wrong when it comes to BACON!! 4 pieces. Wish there are more....

Fresh Mex  Sampler - Chicken fajita nachos, chicken quesadilla, border wings and crispy chicken flautas. Perfect to share! If you just feel like having a drink and not really want to have a big meal, this will be a great choice!! Different varieties of appetizers.

Mango Margarita - I love frozen margarita! The mango flavor is strong. Wish they put a little bit more tequila or else taste like mango smoothie.

The Parking: Parking structure behind the restaurant. Might be crowded since sharing it with IKEA and other restaurants and retailers.<//Text>

The only reason I invited my friend Paul to meet me there is becuz I had a BOGO, BUT lo and behold, the 2 for 1 is only good at lunch. Okay, I got 20% off coupon as well, so I figured something is SOMETHING. But it's Happy Hour so Paul wants a beer 🍺, BUT Happy Hour prices are only good if ur eating in the bar 🍸, where the menu is limited to street tacos, and I wanted a taco salad. At that point, since all the waitress had done is put down chips & salsa and kvetch abt how awful it would be if we were to abandon her table for the wilderness of the bar. Paul, who must've begun channeling Joseph P. Kennedy at this point, began trying to appease the waitress, even tho he really wanted that cheap beer 🍺. I was already standing, putting on my hat and heading for the door. Paul, stayed, moved to the bar, had cheap beer 🍺 and Street Tacos, I guess, as I was long gone. I will be burning 🔥 the BOGO coupon I still have from Chevy's in effigy! As a statement against one of the WORST restaurant experiences I have EVER had! And it will a cold day in HELL B4 I EVER return to Chevy's HOME of shabby treatment, and poverty stricken customer service. They put the AWE in AWFUL!!!< /review>< user>

I had a combo plate with flautas, tamale and enchilada.  The "green chile" on the enchilada looked like a congealed gelatin.  The  tamale was horrible.  The flautas were just okay.   Everything on the combo plate was cold.  The food tasted as if had been frozen and momentarily reheated in a microwave.  Only the beans and rice were hot and served on a separate dish.  That said, the wait staff was excellent.  I feel sorry for them if they ever have to eat that rubbish.<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

I love coming here. I start off by getting a Mango Cadillac Margarita on the rocks. The carnitas are awesome, the crispy chicken flautas are bomb, the fresh guacamole is good, but add Fresh jalapeño and the salsa they give you for chips and it's out of this world.</text>

HORRIBLE! We were trying to celebrate  my Bday.. were only there for 15 mins max.. we asked for a booth hostess Said  "  sure its gonna be a lil longer".. we were ok with that. . She Calls us..  there is none available because the waitress has a big party" (restaurant was more then half empty)... It was super HOT in there.. we asked to sit outside, she said " oh you could but there is bugs" ohhh ok we will take i guess the dirty table you are offering... Hostess had an attitude like she hates that place as much as we did..WE LEFT.. we came here because the first time was GREAT.. i don't know if there will be a 3rd time.. Now we are at Don Cuco in Burbank.. Tables are clean AC works.. Chevys in Burbank DIDN'T ruin my BDAY!!!</text>

<review>Nice place to hang out. Big margaritas afordable prices. We order one day some fajitas that are defenetly for two or more! Bartender are friendly, food is average. Nice terrace in front of Ikea and just one corner of the burbank center tower. Parking just there.</review><pictures>None</pictures><GmapID>0x80c29544f42e7023:0xf13b07030b55adee</GmapID>< Date>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We had previously rented a van from the Redwood City Uhaul and had an overall negative experience (took an hour to check in with 1 person in front of us, had to redo all the online information in person, charged more than initially expected).  This was the exact opposite of that.  There's no parking in the lot so you park on El Camino but the check in process was easy, quick, the customer service rep was friendly and helpful, and the price was exactly as advertised.  We would rent from here again.</Text>< Pics>

I was charged for the 3 GL of fuel I didn't use because of the incorrect amount of the fuel that was set initially during equipment pickup process. When I complained about the fuel charge, the employee at the counter just kept repeating "You clicked approve, You clicked approve". Yes I clicked the approve button because I thought uhaul employee would've set it correctly (Why wouldn't you?). Apparently the uhaul employee at this branch didn't do their job well. You could've set the correct fuel amount to begin with.<//text>

I had a great experience with this location! David was extremely helpful in assisting me with the items I needed for my move and helped me to the car with them. Moving can be stressful and this store was like hitting the easy button. On-site parking and street parking available! Highly recommend!< /review>

I had reserved a truck one month prior to our moving date. We got a call 18 hours before our reservation start time saying they cant give us our reserved truck. Why, because the messed up and dont have availability any more. My wife and I had the worst week of our lives since we had to settle for a smaller van and move other stuff in our cars. I drove 500+ miles in a week to load/unload our furniture to a safe location. Customer care and on-site staff were not helpful at all (plus they are rude) as they kept asking me to talk to different departments. If our friends and family wouldn't have helped, we were prepared to keep our furniture on the streets.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>If I could give this place a zero I would. The costumer service is terrible. They just made it so difficult to rent a van. One of the workers made it feel like it was an inconvenience to help me. When you make a reservation here be prepared to deal with impolite and unprofessional staff.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

U-Haul as a corporation is failing their workers and their customers. I'm sure they're still making a profit of our backs. Every time I've shown up to the Belmont location something has gone wrong. They haven't had the equipment I need, or I put in that I need the equipment for a longer period of time than what they can allow off their website. And just most recently I had a reservation for a storage unit that doesn't exist. What does exist is a third floor storage unit with no elevator. They have also modified their covid-19 barriers for their employees. And common sense shows that they are putting their customers and their employees at greater risk by creating more holes for them to pass the virus back and forth.  Please wear a good mask when you come in to their location.In my opinion, outside of the local workers who seem to be doing the best that they can with what they are given, U-Haul corporation is dirty and they're just trying to make a profit without delivering a product.<//Text>

<Date>1603386763952</Date><review>Stay away from this location at all cost!!!!! This location is mismanagement. We booked a 24foot truck 3 weeks ahead, had movers and everyone ready to go for the moving day. I am 8 1/2 weeks pregnant, So we wanted to rent the biggest truck so we only had to do one trip in case if I need to go to the hospital. On the day of the moving they informed us that our truck of 26feet was overbooked and not available. They said all they had left was 1 smaller truck of 20feet,. My husband had no choice but to take that truck since we had the movers and everyone waiting for the move.
While trying to load the truck we noticed there was glue spilled all over the back of the Truck, making it impossible to utilize the whole truck, on top of that the hinch on the ramp was broken. Not only did we ended up taking longer to upload the truck, but we also could not use the whole truck, being afraid that boxes and furniture might get shifted during the move and fall into that glue.
We called the next day to notify the location that we will need the truck another day given the circumstances that they give us a truck that was not operating correctly.
We got charged $436.36 for 2 days. I am now filling a claim and disputing the charges, for this nightmare experience. Stay away from this location at all cost!!! The manager does not know what he is doing.<//review>< UserId.>

<Review>STAY AWAY!!! I reserved a uhaul at this location 15 days prior to my move. At 4pm the day before my move (when I was picking up 3 family members who had FLOWN IN to help me move) I got a text saying I can check in for my uhaul rental... to pick up in SOUTH LAKE TAHOE! And yes I check my original reservation and I had selected this location.

Yep, that’s right. They moved my reservation from 2 minutes up the road to four hours from my apartment. I was on hold for over an hour, spent about 3 minutes talking to customer service only to be put back on hold. At this point, I went up to speak to someone in person. The (extremely rude) guy told me that they don’t have a truck for me (even though there were about 30 trucks in the lot) because “all of these have been reserved for in-town moves”. Yeah. Right.

He wouldn’t do anything for us, Scoffed at me when I said I didn’t want to “call this number” because I had been on hold for over an hour. I even offered to bring the truck back after I move (all the way to LA).

So basically we ended up actually driving to SLT (50 was closed so it took 4 hours), got there at 1am, paid $150 for a hotel room, got 5 hours of sleep and then picked up the uhaul and drove another 4 hours back to the Bay Area to start loading and drive to LA same day.

Do not do business with this disgusting company. We will never use uhaul again and will make sure our friends and family don’t either. Companies shouldn’t be able to get away with this scummy behavior. Be better.< /Review>< Pictures>

The supervisor thats working there today is so rude and has a very bad attitude. He should not be working in this position and with people. I wish I could have spoken with his boss. Not sure how he became a supervisor.<//text>

Literally he refused to turn the ball over on the hitch to fit my truck.  Basically said "figure it out then come get me when you're ready."  Correct me if I'm mistaken but YOU GUYS INSTALL HITCHES FOR A LIVING!!!!

Canceled the trailer and went to UHaul SF and worked with a crew who could not have been nicer.  In an effort to preserve the scare resources that are stars, I'm giving all yours to them.  In fact, if I could save one more, I would.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Date>1512403627683<//Date><Rating>4<//Rating><review>I'm reviewing U-Haul truck rental. My in-town truck rental from Belmont U-Haul was excellent.

I rented a 20 foot truck one day, then a 15 foot truck the following weekend, then a 9 foot van.  Each time, the experience went great.

I was able to use the after-hours truck return system to park and check in the truck using an Android app late at night.  They let me have the truck up to 24 hours for the same one-day price.

There were no unexpected charges during any of my three rentals.

Four stars instead of five because during my first rental, I was new to the whole process and I felt a little bit like the staff was rushing through things and not being 100% patient.  But I understand that customer service is damn hard :)< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Unrelated to their main business, but were unbelievably helpful with a car problem I had out front of their storefront. They went out of their way to assist me, and saved my morning. Again, has not much to do with their main business, but are the kind of people I'd want to work with.<//Review>

The people at this location were very helpful and provided good customer service. 8:30 pickup on Oct. 1 went smoothly with no wait. The rental van however was dirty on the inside and out with bad liquids in the cup holders from prior users.< /Review>

<review>I had a hitch installed at this UHaul, dropped my car off at 7:30am and it still wasn’t ready at 4:30pm. I waited in the store almost two hours before it was ready. Then when I went to another uhaul to pick up the cargo trailer, they said the brake lights weren’t working on the trailer because I’d been sold a bad module with the hitch install. I’m not sure if they didn’t test it after installing or if they just didn’t care that they were selling me a bad part. Not the way I wanted to start my 600 mile move. Would not recommend a hitch install at this location.</review>< GmapID>

<text>It’s amazing how you can ruin a perfectly good business with the wrong staff.

Checked in for a new storage to find the elevator was broken (large truck, big move, multiple staircases make no sense). No big deal, it happens, but no notification was made to let us know, no plan was suggested, no alternatives were noted? The staff offered no solutions and more than that, just didn’t seem to have a clue for us or any of the other interactions happening.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Fellow Burners - DO NOT RENT FROM THIS LOCATION

The van was in good condition and we had no issue during our use of it.

Nevertheless less than 5 min after we returned it on September 5th we were asked if we went to Burning Man by an employee and right after we answered in full honesty we were told we would be charged a clean up fee for a few footsteps on the mat located in the van’s loading area.
Despite the fact that the driver’s cabin and the engine were impeccable, the employees and their manager would not accept to admit that their assessment was exaggerated.
We washed the van for 3 hours using high pressure washer in addition to sprays and cloths to remove the dust. These few footsteps had nothing to do with the playa dust and could have come from any place as it was used to load and unload luggage from other places we went (Reno, Tahoe). I wish I could share pictures but in the rush to catch a plane I missed this opportunity.
While I am ok to argue that these foot steps in the loading area could have been removed, the fact that we faced a zealous employee that admitted she knew from the dates we rented the van that we went to Burning Man to me clearly sounds like this agency is on the lookout for extra cash during the Burning Man season.

We’ve rented multiple times one or 2 Uhauls for Burning Man and it’s the first time this happens despite following the same process every year.

In short we felt we were treated unfairly and we do not recommend this location for Burning Man.</text>

Good service for short local moves. Free night drop-off is very convenient.
My manager Maria Rueda was very polite even at the end of the day.
No extra money was charged. I'm completely satisfied by this service.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Terrible - if I could give minus stars I would. Sent here from Redwood City U-haul because they told us this U-haul has storage access until 10pm. It even says 10pm access on their website. We get here at 6.45pm and the staff tell us they'll be closing at 7pm and we can't have access after 7, that there's nothing they can do and their website and colleagues are wrong. A staff member admitted that they could stay but they don't want to go home late. Manager ...useless response 'I'll change the website tomorrow'. President's number no answer. Stuck here with a van full of stuff, 3 cars and nowhere to put it. Thanks u-haul</review></record></dataset><record>

The worst experience in terms of service, also their system does not work had automatic services and made an extra charge of $ 35.00 extra each month and if that were not enough they sent messages that I have to pay when I delivered the warehouse from a month ago. I recommend using other wineries with better service and more economical in bay area.<//Review>

<text>Went to go fill up my propane tank, the guy filling it, was belligerent and harassed us during the our time there to the point where we left, we to this day have no idea why the U-Haul guy was so pissed at us.  How difficult is it to just fill up a propane tank?  How hard is it to not harass customers for 10 min?  As I can see from the reviews my experience was not a anomaly.<//text>< GmapID>

I would have been Greater served by Carrying the desk I had to move on MY BACK!!!...rather than dealing with U-Haul & their collective OVER CHARGING & Complete LACK of Customer Service!!!....

Do yourselves a favor in the future....Rent a Burro ...You'll be far MORE satisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ....Mark Joey<//review>

The only good thing about this place is they back all the trailers for you..however pack a lunch if you picking up a load..sometimes you have to wait until freight is there or on the way..< /text>

Worst place ever this company does not appreciate the employees, the owner an manager only care about filling up there pockets with money. this company hires anybody even people who have felonys an aren't responsible. the work place is poor not enough ventilations for all the forklifts that are around, and drivers are very reckless. this place does not know how to run things smoothly at all and its really far from improving< /Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>They tell me the load is ready, it just needs to be relocated from the port container into my trailer. It turns out that they left out a "small" detail, that they also had to palletize the load, and wrap. They palletized  28 pallets, each pallet contained a sum of 200 small boxes. I was told this when it was too late to find another load, as it was 3pm on a Friday. So I had to wait there until 2:30am. The warehouse hours are until 1am on Fridays, but clearly the loaders did not mind the overtime, as they took their sweet time to load. This was my second and the better experience there in two years. Avoid them if you can, and if you can't, I feel your pain.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd3445e3292c2d:0xd5e4c1d5186fd509</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Chinese drivers should not come. 15:22 enter the door. After arriving at the warehouse, I waited more than half an hour to check in. The goods were not loaded until 10 o'clock. Two trucks that arrived later than me and my unloading address. The same appointment time. The same unloading time. They left several hours before me. Bad Thanksgiving! Black Friday!

(Original)
华人司机不要过来。15:22进门。到仓库后等了半个多小时才给check in。一直到10点才给装好货。比我晚到的两个卡车和我一个卸货地址。同样的预约时间。同样的卸货时间。他们比我早走好几个小时。糟糕的感恩节！黑色星期五！< /review>

Love the Mexican Mocha and Blueberry Muffin I ordered. It's a great spot to sit outside and enjoy a nice day for a moment. Went on a Sunday and noticed their brunch menu. It looked tasty.</Text>

< Review>
Wow!!! The food is absolutely phenomenal, so fresh and flavorful. The coffee drinks were so tasty and the lavender lemonade was ridiculously refreshing. The tri tip in the burrito had a great smoky taste and was well balanced by in the house salsa. The breakfast potatoes were crispy and well seasoned, while the eggs and veggies on the Benedict were cooked to perfection. The service was friendly and everything was very clean inside and out. I look forward to coming back and trying lunch.< /Review>

This place is great for breakfast or lunch.  They have really good eggs and toast, and they have hot teas.  The teas are a bit pricey, but very good.

They also have good salads and a variety of lunch options.  Located near the movie complex in the Eastvale Gateway mall.

Good place. Check it out!< /review>

Whenever possible, I love to support local coffee shops and was excited to see EastBrew pop up in a Google search while visiting family in Eastvale. This shop has something to offer everyone. The Mexican latte I ordered did not disappoint and I enjoyed viewing the local art on display while waiting for my drink. Looking forward to trying some of their locally sourced vegan lunch and freshly baked pastry options the next time I am in town.<//Review>

One of my favorite places to grab coffee. My favorites are the Horchata Latte, and the Chilaquiles. They also have a nice selection of pastries, brunch and dinner items. They also have a variety of milks to choose from, and their straws are made of agave fibers. I would definitely recommend checking this place out.< /Review>

<text>Extremely inconsistent.
One Saturday, it will be one of the best brunches you've ever had ... the next, it will be your kids first attempt at making you breakfast. This is most true with the parmesean potatoes. It can be deflating to get home, open your food, and instantly realize it's one of the bad times.
They're obviously capable of living up to their menu, it just doesn't happen one out of every three times.< /text><gmapID>0x80dccbe1c91a43a5:0xec2c62a105ea698a< /gmapID>< Rate>

<review>I first tried Eastbrew Cafe about 2 weeks ago and now I am utterly obsessed with this amazing family owned cafe. I have been back three times since then and this is now a weekly location for my mom and I do have a breakfast date. The food is amazing and has a home style feel. The coffee? Even better! My favorite drink there is the iced horchata latte with oatmilk (although it's equally amazing with whole milk). The cafe is always clean, staff if extremely friendly, and are following covid 19 safety guild lines. I HIGHLY recommend trying out this local business and enjoying the best cup of coffee Eastvale has to offer! =)</review><Pics>None< /Pics><username>katherine guevara< /username><response>None<//response>< rate>

I stopped here for a coffee but after seeing their long list of hot drinks and enticing menu we sat down for lunch. The food (with vegan options) was savory and delightful. Amazing creativity in dishes and all for a low price !</review>

This is my new favorite place! The bacon avocado toast is insanely delicious! Their coffee and cold brew are also amazing! BUT the best is their attention to detail and customer service....Savanna is the best! I ordered here last weekend and she called to make sure how sweet and how many pumps of flavor I wanted in my coffee, then I walk in today and she remembered my order....even though I'd only been 1 time! That's impressive and it was made perfect yet again. Beyond impressed with her service and personal touch! She mad emy day with both visits 😃< /Review>

We had sandwiches and mine was the tri-tip.  It was flavorful however it was tough and hard to chew.  Some was unchewable.  The bottom piece of bread was soggy however the bread was fresh from the top pieces ate.  The best part of my meal was the cinnamon roll.  I was told it was made fresh that morning and I believe them, it was REALLY GOOD!  Their cold brew that I had with it was very also.  The employees were very and we were served fast.  I know I will be back for that continental breakfast for sure!</review>

The one thing I super love is that their coffee has its own distinct flavor. You won't find a drink at starbucks or Dunkin with their roasted, almost bitter tasting coffee (I mean that in the best of ways)
The bakery selection, for what I did try, was through the roof. Great great job!

I'm giving this only four stars however because... Well the coffee is good but it isn't something I'm going to scream from the mountains to go try. I'm still a Dunkin man at heart for a quick easy brew but when I see a mom and pop cafe I love to try them and ... This one doesn't make me compelled to really come back. If I'm in the area then sure, why not. It's not a bad option by any means but the flavors it provides are just alright.</Text>

Wow. Wow. Wow! This cute little cafe is the perfect addition to our cute little community. It’s exactly what we needed! The staff is super FRIENDLY , the coffee was delicious and the Breakfast-ish burrito was so yummy. They’ve definitely acquired a new customer.. good bye you know who!</review>

SO FREAKIN GOOD! Wish I could give it 10 stars. We went for brunch and I had a Veggie and a Baconator visit with me. All 3 of us walked away with full bellies and happy smiles. The food is so fresh,  and clean! Local sources, and local artists,  great food. The breakfast menu includes a magical burrito that was everything I could have ever wanted in A Sunday morning.</Text>

They turn away customers with medical conditions who cant wear masks. Very disappointing. I wonder how long they will last here. This was my first time here and I was very excited to try a new local bakery and get my daughters teacher some tasty treats. They lost my business.<//Review>

They don’t answer the phone, wanted to ask a simple question about one of the dishes, called 6 separate times and they just don’t answer. Why even have a number listed on your website if you can’t answer?< /text>

If you looking for a quiet out of the way place for excellent coffee and a to die for danish (blueberry), look no further. I've been working in that little nook area by the theater for years and it had been (how did that "critic" put it)...meh for a few years. A few shops had recently closed. These guys move in and it has really brought a lot of ambiance to the area. It's right around the fountain. One of the owners saw me working. He came out and just started chopping it up with me. Just a genuinely nice guy. He offered to make me a coffee. Let me say I am a dark roast, french roast, kind of guy. I usually take a pass when someone offers me a coffee. something, something, something...I take him up on on his offer and I was blown away. One of the best tasting cups, all the way to the last drop, I've had in awhile. I am going back for more. Everyone there treated me with a smile and kindness. Do yourself a favor...go there try one of the coffee's and just relax. Sit by the fountain and take a load off. There's not many places like this.<//Review>

One morning we thought of giving it a try, stopped by, early in the morning, seemed they had just opened, we wanted to order food, unfortunately we were told kitchen didnt open till 11am for food. For customers that eat earlier in the day, this doesnt help. Not alot of pastries were available either. Maybe in future they will serve earlier then 11am. We didn't even get coffee, went elsewhere.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Working here during my summer internship was one of the most helpful and meaningful experiences. From company culture to professional development, this team is filled with people who care about who you are and aid you in your pursuit for success. What you put into this opportunity is what you get out of it. Hard work pays off here. Highly recommend working for this company because they taught me so much in sales/marketing, interviewing/recruiting, and leadership. Join if you are looking for a job with no cap on how far you can grow! Very grateful!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Amazing experience with company, tremendous growth potential, great team culture! Working for this company has helped me develop in many ways, both financial and personal means.

My experience at True Vision was one like I wouldn’t be able to get any where else. It was a great work environment, and the employees and managers there genuinely care for you. I was able to enhance my skill set when it comes to dealing with customers, learning how to be a problem solver, and also got some management experience as well. This is a great work opportunity and would definitely recommend for people who are looking to get experience in the business development/ marketing field.<//Text>

If you worked here be ready to not realize the full extent of the damage until tax season. They never sent my W2, even though I had updated my address before I left the job, & I called multiple times to have it sent & some girl even took my email down & never sent it.
I hired a professional to handle this situation, they had to request transcripts from the IRS. When I finally got my IRS tax transcript- first thing we noticed was that this company is listed under a totally different name with the IRS AND they never took out California state tax so I ended up owing that money . Don’t say you haven’t been warned.< /Text>

We do take any and all required Federal and State taxes out of each employee check, I can't speak to your situation directly but I do wish you luck in the future! Again, thank you for your feedback and I urge you to contact our HR team with any additional concerns!"}</response>

I have learn a lot from here but I always spend a lot on gas money going to far  places. Plus when I join a week later the ppl who train me quit and found a better career path then this job. The ppl here are friendly and it’s a great work environment  but I wouldn’t recommend it to ppl who aren’t skilled enough to sell their products... Other then that it’s a great job.<//Review>

Genuine company although misleading job postings. I understand their goals and what type of talent they are attempting to attract. However, the job postings are VERY misleading. The market manager positions are actualy field marketing representatives, representing brands in store and selling services to consumers. The pay is directed at very entry level candidates.

The recruiter I spoke with was very helpful and informative and she did a great job. However, from our first call the position seemed more of an actual marketing manager working with brands to achieve maximum ROI through marketing campaigns and overseeing several campaigns across multiple brands. Upon my second call back I mentioned I read these reviews and she was much more transparent in what the job actually was. Although theres nothing wrong with the position, it was misleading. Hence, the guy that pulled up in his Tesla(from another reviwe here) thinking it was a career advancement opportunity.

The company is 100% legit and not a scam, HOWEVER your recruiting department has some work to do in presenting the job as what it is. Had you presented the job correctly, you'd see a lot less negative reviews. For those seeking a first job or would like to transition from retail into brand marketing, this is the job for you. For those who are already in marketing, are managers, and have experience in field marketing, this is NOT the job for you. And to be clear i'm talking about the Marketing Manager position ONLY, as that was the position I was initially interested in and was in discussion with the recruiter.<//Review>

I went for a job interview and I felt like there wasn't a clear view of what the position was from it's posting. I drove an hour for not even a minute interview and never heard a thing. The interviewer was not interested in talking to me even before he called me back. He was walking in and out of the building on his phone, didn't smile or make contact when coming into the seating area. Once being in there I felt as if he had made up his mind based on seeing me and wasn't interested in wasting his time. He ask very generic questions and nothing about me. It was probably the worse interviewer I've ever had.< /review>
<response>{'time': 1579625233955, 'text': "Hi Mel, thank you for bringing this situation to our attention. Unfortunately, because the position you applied for was an entry-level role, we typically have to hold many interviews to find the right fit.

We take the applicant screening process very seriously and as a team, we make it a priority to be as transparent as possible during any hiring exchange from the ad placed, to communication with our team, to the on-boarding process, and we always welcome questions and concerns. I would like to apologize if you felt like you weren't given a fair shot at a position with us. We are an equal opportunity company and are always looking for the best talent to join our team. I will definitely make sure to pass along your feedback to our management team because improvement is always our top priority!

A typical deceptive company you can learn about in business 101 or logic. A great attractive job/career/environment for the general public = brainless.

A company owned by humans whom have no moral or ethical standards, that take advantage of not-so-intelligent people, the type of people who are bound to get scammed six to twelve more times in the future. Can't blame Darwinism.

Good luck.</Text>

< Review>
I was offered to schedule an interview by email and then by a phone call. When a company has to open up by glittering their business and saying that you’ll be working in the same building as the CEO, then you have to question the job already. When reading the description of the job, it made it seem like I would be working behind the scenes and helping the sales team, but failed to mention that you’ll just be a sales person. “Marketing Specialist” is a very deceiving title for a sales position job. When the lady on the phone told me I’ll be handling accounts for multiple businesses I paused and asked if it’s individual consumer accounts, as in regular people signing up for these telecommunication businesses. That’s when I told her I was not interested in sales and she responded with “Next time just read the job description, okay bye” and hung up while I laughed and said “okay than you.” Very unprofessional from this lady and it felt like a scam. Just tell people it’s a sales job and that they’ll be selling products at a booth. No need to sugar coat the position and hype up this business’ reputation. Trust the reviews on here. Shady place.<//Review>

This people are strange. So they sent me an email to tell me about my resume being reviewed and a time for the interview. Like I said before. I'm glad I saw these reviews before attending the INTERVIEW. The job discription was very misleading. Please don't scam people in to wasting their time to go. Be honest in regards to what the job consists of before they waste their time on a drive. Thank you,

Best regards< /text>

I'm very glad I ready the reviews in regards as to what the jobs consists of. I will no longer be doing the interview.

<review>If you are fine working with C and B players, this is for you.  Yes, I drive a Tesla, I made 6 figures, and your workers are envious; rude comments, pre-judge stating, as I pulled up in my Tesla in your lot and I hear; ‘why is He here, and rudely laughs.’  — very condescending.  Maybe I arrived with real good intentions and opportunities that I wanted to share during the meet to increase business for you because I had an idea that is of mutual benefits.

In addition, Please Keep the job description and expectations very clear to prevent the waste of people’s time.  Deceptive work environment, loud TV background is not a welcoming environment to attract the best talents.  What can people expect when they are located in a C class building and does basic business.  They don’t want the best talents; frankly, it comes across more that, they more interested in the disposing of basic talents and basic people.  Easy Read.</review>< Pictures>

Claiming every review for the last couple of years is “misleading” shows just how inflexible and indignant this company is. There is no arguing the services, products and jobs provided are extremely vague for a reason.

Edit: yeah sorry I didn’t leave enough about my indendity for me to be told I’m leaving a misleading review. Instead you argue me using your clients. Yeah you may subcontract for a Fortune 500 company, but you aren’t one. Your feedback wouldn’t be so negative if you detailed what people would be doing while working for you. Thanks for again, arguing online about your reputation rather than fixing it.< /Text>

< Review>
I applied here becauae they both headlined and described that they were looking for a "customer service representative". When I went to their website to do research, it was empty of real information, and very vague. When I was asked to come in, I was told that it was because they saw my resume, and felt that I qualified for the position. However, they asked that I bring in my resume. If I received the interview based on my resume, why do I need to bring several copies of the same resume you liked enough to invite me to an interview? If I didn't bring my resume, I was told that I would need to fill out my resume on a on application form provided at the office. When I interviewed, I was told, and explained that I would be selling products to people at Costco. I was told that they were looking for someone to promote very quickly, but never described the process or what was needed to advance in the company. When I explained that I applied because the job was described as a customer service position, I was told that while at the stores, attempting to sell these products, if a customer needed help finding something in the store, I would either, help them find it, or help them find a store representative to better assist them. That is not customer service, that is providing free labor to the store I'm at. An utter and complete waste of time, due to falsely advertising the position they were hiring for, and the company purposely being vague. My interviewer explained to me that they are purposely vague, because they want you to come in to see if the job is a fit, and then go through 2 more interviews. Probably a good fit for someone right out of high school.< /Review>

I came here for an interview for a job offered by many companies with different names.  There are supposed to be three interviews for lucky applicants.  I have not been called back & don't expect to.</text>

<text>The WORST interview I have ever gone to. I'm not even joking when I say that it was 1 minute long. The guy who interviewed me, didn't even make eye contact. He was horrible.

I did not have a good view of this company now. Plus it seemed like a party place anyways.<//text>< Pictures>

Went in for interview, didn't get the job. They were honest about the job description but only after I stated I had done my research.</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1542231265237, 'text': 'Sorry to hear you feel that way Alexandra! Our firm actually works with a lot of other telecommunications, mobility, and entertainment clients than what was listed. The exciting thing is that we are marketing with new brands as well as retailers and are continuing to grow into new avenues. All of the new positions we are offer are hourly plus bonuses as well as medical insurance for those interested in full time, so I think you may be confused. Best of luck on your future endeavors!'}< /Response></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) He worked here for more than a year. They prepared you for failure. They promote it to monitor locations outside the area. Accumulate more and more responsibilities on your plate until you can no longer do it and fail. My recommendation is to stay away. Do not waste your time!

Not bad but why they lie about having empty trailers is beyond me. They expect you to come with an empty but can't give you one... if everyone hoards empty trailers no one will every be able to come and get your products to move. Please take the people who move your products into consideration and have some respect. Also, be mindful of how you guys pack your trailers and where it's supposed to go, you load it unbalanced, on top of all the other minute nuances us truck drivers have to go through including but not limited to disrespectful drivers, we now have to worry about how you guys stuffed the trailers and how to balance them so we can haul your products legally and safely. Like I said this is something very important. My last shipment had came from Washington and had been sitting in Reno to be taken to California, well it was, I suppose okay for all those other states, but the way it was packed the weight was illegal for California (it's final destination), and there was no more room to adjust my tandems to make the weight limit,  and there was no way for me to take it back to Washington for you guys to open your seal and rearrange everything up to code... there was a lot of man power and hours lost to get that load to be legal and safe to be delivered to its destination, this shouldn't happen,  this should not be a thing anymore in this day in age.< /text>

We deliver product here, Red Collar Pet, San Bernadino, and have been here 5 times. Have had to wait 3-4 DAYS to get unloaded with no reason given. They leave it all up to the “guard” to handle the delivery drivers. If we didn’t have kids we could go visit while waiting we would NOT deliver here. You are expected to just sit in your truck until they are ready to unload you. Again, for 3-4 days!?!?  They need new schedule managers. Doesn’t matter when your appointment ( which they require) is. They will call you in whenever they feel like it and the “average”wait time is supposedly 18 hours. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!</Text>

<Review>Come to this place to P/U a load twice this week been a great experiences. From the security guard to the staff i dealt with at shipping is great. Despite the current event with Covid-19 the procedures been easy. You have to drop the trailer as part of their security protocol. This is from personal experiences, I can’t speak on the other drivers negative experience.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c351f01d3870f1:0xd1a285827f72d47f<//GmapID></record>

Saw sign on the wall in shipping department and it says - Great people . I can't agree
Sorry but shipping guy was very very rude . For no reason .
I've seen lots of shipping guys but THIS ANGRY AND RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL ?? We all can have bad days but it doesn't mean we can treat other people that way .
Other than that - nice facility .<//text>

<Review>I'd give 10 stars if I could. We just used Titan for an interstate move (Chino to Utah) and they were great. Fast, clean and efficient service. For interstate moves, they have one Stan drive the truck to the location and then hire out any more necessary movers in the local area for unloading. Our two local movers in Salt Lake ended up getting COVID at the last minute and called out, but Stan from Titan still unloaded the whole truck by himself. Took him just four hours to unload a two bedroom apartment and he stayed bright and positive the whole time. These are difficult times to move, but Titan and Stan made it easy and remained flexible. I would definitely use them again.<//Review>< pics>

Moving during a global pandemic is terrible, but moving twice is even worse. Fortunately, we hired Titan both times and they were amazing. The first time was me moving out of my condo and putting stuff in a storage unit and the second was moving that same stuff PLUS the contents of my boyfriend's apartment to our new house. Both times were made so easy thanks to Titan Relocation Services.</review>

<review>I have moved many times over the years, both domestically and internationally, and Titan Relocation Services were by far the best - living up to their name.  I chose Titan based solely on the overwhelmingly positive google reviews, and I am so pleased I did.  Adrian, Romero and Angel were punctual, professional and took extreme care with my things -- including antiques I have collected and highly value.  They are also very kind, respectful and efficient.
I needed an immediate move-out and was able to schedule with two days' notice.  Joel was very accommodating and highly attentive before and during the move.  I will recommend Titan Relocation Services and will use them again.</review>< pictures>

<review>"This is a top-notch moving company. From the the initial reservation Joel, we knew we made a great selection in choosing Titan Relocation Services. Joel was very nice, and courteous to call and let us know the movers were running a bit behind in getting to the apartment, however when Slava and Fara arrived, they were very apologetic and more than made up for it, by loading the truck (very carefully). They took the time to protect (by wrapping think blankets and taping) the furniture. These gentlemen were very courteous, professional, and proficient. They packed up the truck, drove it from Dimond Bar to Lake Elsinore, uploaded all the furniture, up a flight a stairs to a 2nd floor apartment in 2 hours!!
I highly recommend Titan Relocation Services! There pricing is very reasonable, and the service is excellent!  Thank you, Joel, Slava and Fara to taking care of my brother's move. We are very grateful to you all for making our move so stress-free. 🙂"</review>< pics>

They were so friendly and gentle with our stuff, and put everything right where we asked! VERY reasonable pricing, honestly feel like they're undercharging. Paid more than a hundred more for my last move and ended up doing a lot of the work myself, but not with these guys!
Next move I'm coming right back to these guys! Best moving experience by far!"< /Review>< Pics>

"I have used these guys twice now. Once back in 2018 and then again Today.  Both times, they were perfect. Easy to book, they have very simple and straight forward billing system.
The pricing for me, three hours $297. Considering they pack whatever you're taking FOR you and help unpack if needed! (I didn't have tons of things so my cost was pretty inexpensive). But even if it cost more, it would still be worth it. NOTHING was broken or damaged :)
They were on time. They weren't on their phones and didn't drag out the time. They were FAST at getting everything packed and loaded and unloaded. The guys were very organized and efficient. Not to mention, very sweet and respectful.
Hopefully I don't have to move anytime soon but if I do, I'll use these guys a third time."</Text>

"They were amazing and professional. Stan, Vlad  and one other guy (I forget his name), moved my one bedroom, 4th floor apartment. They were courteous, clean and didn't milk the clock. They were also good with the pup running around. I have a lot of stuff and it took 6 hours to get everything out of the apartment and into the new house which is 8 miles away.
They provided a detailed receipt at the end that outlines the exact time of arrival and departure and subtracted their lunch to the exact minute. Very professional as I said."</Review>

Adrian and his team did  a very thorough move from/to my homes. They were attentive with all my items. I really appreciated the alternative solutions Adrian provided. They communicated well with each other, too. I really appreciated them helping me move to my new home- a really smooth transition. Thank You Adrian and your team!! Awesome work!</text>

Juan and his team were amazing! I moved into a two story home and the majority of items had to be upstairs. They wrapped all of my furniture well and nothing was damaged in the move.  They worked efficient and were able to complete my entire move in 4 hours which was amazing. Would highly recommend and hire them again for any future move!< /text>

After being taken advantage of before by a previous mover who I believe is no longer in business, I was reluctant to hire another mover. However, I found myself in the position that I needed help around Independence day , and my friends were not available. Joel at Titan relocation services responded to my request promptly and reassured me that his pricing was all- inclusive (this was the issue I ran into with the other company), and that his prices were fair. I couldn't have been more pleased with the efficiency and professionalism of the guys that came out. Slava, Anthony and Nick were friendly and took great care of my stuff during the move. They even took the time to set my stuff up for me at my new home. I highly recommend this company.</Review>

Had Juan, Tony and Andrei move me into my house, they were very quick and efficient and treated every item with care. Very good experience all around. Even though I had set everything up the night before, I had quick responses from office staff and movers were on time and immediately got to work. Highly recommended.<//Review>

The pricing for me, three hours $297. Considering they pack whatever you're taking FOR you and help unpack if needed! (I didn't have tons of things so my cost was pretty inexpensive). But even if it cost more, it would still be worth it. NOTHING was broken or damaged :)

They were on time. They weren't on their phones and didn't drag out the time. They were FAST at getting everything packed and loaded and unloaded. The guys were very organized and efficient. Not to mention, very sweet and respectful.

Hopefully I don't have to move anytime soon but if I do, I'll use these guys a third time.<//text>< pics>

My husband and I were so happy with Titans. I did my Yelp research, and this caught my attention with positive and detailed feedback from other Yelpers.
From the initial booking via phone to the final hour of unpacking, we were pleased with the services. We've moved before but never needed movers until now. There is a a three hour minimum. There is also a discount if you pay cash. The movers arrived promptly. There was no slacking from this moving crew. They worked hard with great attention to detail. They were also very nice. They carefully packed everything with nothing broken. They also had free wardrobe boxes, which other moving companies charge extra for.  I would definitely use Titan Relocation Services again.</Review>

<Review>"Look no further! This is the moving company to call. These guys will take all the stress out of moving. They were thorough and professional. Every piece of furniture was meticulously wrapped in blankets and plastic. They were quick and efficient, while still being very attentive and careful. If you're worried about it being over-priced or that they are going to count up every box or piece of tape they used, don't worry. These guys are over-the-top with customer service and making sure the customer is happy. I felt the move was very reasonably priced.
I booked my move a couple of weeks in advance but had to change the date and time several times. My building also has a strict moving policy and medium sized elevator. No problem. They accommodated my changes and special requests very easily. The team arrived on time and were accessible via text that morning. I had a range of furniture that included a marble table top, Steelcase desk, and leather couch, all handled with the utmost care. All my plants were carefully placed in boxes. I was really impressed with the process.
To top it off, the office followed up with a phone call the next day to check on my experience. This was the best moving experience. I will only use Titan Relocation Moving Company if I ever move again."< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>"So glad I found this team - I will definitely use them again. The two gentlemen were prompt (I rec'd a text about :20m prior to their arrival), they hustled the whole time, and were super charming!
""I had a large flat screen but no proper packaging - they weren't initially going to take it. I must've looked defeated, so he said """"ok, we can take it - but you'll need to review & sign a waiver understanding our policy on transporting TVs"""" - I gladly signed acknowledging the TV was safer with them than me - an adult woman with the upper body strength of a child!""
My items were picked up and dropped off brilliantly - no scratches, no damages, everything was handled with care. They even built my dresser.
Easy process - rec'd a quote online and got a call to confirm. Signed an agreement after the gentlemen did a walk-thru of the items that needed to be moved. After the final box was delivered - I was invited to check that the truck was completely emptied, and then signed the final paperwork and paid the bill.

I cannot say enough about the above-superior service your men provided for our move. They were punctual, polite, worked quickly, very hard non-stop and wouldn't even stop for a slice of pizza. They gladly attended to anything unforeseen that popped up and their willingness was like nothing I've ever experienced with any other movers. They clearly labeled all the boxes and put them in the correct rooms and helped set up the new apt.
Communication via phone calls and emails were promptly answered. I'd like to give a special shout out to Stan for all that he did too. He answered all our questions and was on top of everything. His upbeat personality made it all a pleasure.
What was incredible is that we moved out of a fourth-floor walk-up with lots of steep staircases-17 per flight...not the typical 12-13 and they didn't complain one bit.
Another moving company (Flat) which we had in the past was horrible, all they did was complain about the stairs (which they were told about prior), they didn't label any boxes and piled all the boxes in a back room at the apartment they delivered to. What a nightmare it was for us to inspect each box and carry them to the appropriate rooms. We had to carry a 65" TV from a back bedroom to the front living room I am a senior citizen. We should've known better and kept an eye on them but live and learn; still, that's no way to run a business. They should take an example from Titan Movers
It is beyond a doubt that I highly recommend Titan Relocation Services; you won't be disappointed!</Text>

I had to move twice in a few months this summer and after finding Titan the first time, I knew I never wanted to use any other company. They are extremely efficient, professional, and friendly. I have never been worried about the handling of my belongings and I trust them completely to get the job done. Moving is so stressful, especially when doing it as often as I have this year, but these guys have always made it easier on me and I'm so grateful. I HIGHLY recommend Titan Relocation Services and will only ever use them in the future. Shoutout to Joel and Mark, you guys are all fantastic.< /Text>

<text>Let me just start like this! Stan and his crew go above and beyond! I don't know how guys can move that fast and not tired out without any breaks for 5 hours straight! They were efficient,communicative,extremely careful with my belongings as if they were there own! These guys are what moving should be! Very affordable,response time was less than 15 minutes and we had a deal! Other companies were extremely over priced! And I've moved with several other companies! None of them could compete on there professionalism, quality of work, efficiency and skill! I have extremely heavy furniture! They use no straps or nothing like that! Just pure strength!!! I was most certainly very impressed!
Stan! Thank you for everything! Couldn't have found better anywhere! You guys are awesome....<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3xa9ndr6zETWJuqgGeXPuM0Z3TfLGvmCKINh3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Joel from Titan Relocation offered a great quote with both estimate and rate for two movers, one truck and four hours. We were moving within 3 minutes from a two bedroom apartment to a house. After seeing the great reviews and competitive price, we decided to hire Joel and his team. No deposit was required. We could pay cash or credit. Scheduling was easy and fast. We were scheduled for July 26, 2020. Slava, Alex and Serg arrived on time and ready to work. They asked questions which I appreciated since they were not just randomly taking things. Our furniture was dismantled and wrapped. They were not able to transport liquids, or delicate lamps, but everything else they took. The lamps fit it my car, so no biggie.
After everything was packed, we drove for a few minutes and they proceeded to put everything were we had asked them too... we also labeled the boxes so that helped. Slava and his team were very careful, responsible, friendly and careful. In three hours or so they had finished, put our furniture back together and left everything cleaned.

The price is very reasonable and cheapest company with best quality as well, they handled everything in my home, covering all the furniture during the move, covering the mirrors, the mattresses, dining room.

If I can give them more than 5 stars I would. We had our move in July. They were very straightforward with pricing, what you see online is what you get. One of the thing a lot of people are concerned about when hiring movers was if the workers will milk the time. With Titan, not at all! In hot summer month, they came 8am, for one bedroom apartment size move, we took about 4 hours, moving distance was 10minutes apart. Not once the guys stop to make phone calls, or even rest! One disappointing thing was they did scratch our brand new couch, very expensive couch. I filed a claim that same day, got a call from the owner Stan about 2 days after and he came to check out our couch. He left with a promise that he will fix the couch! Being nervous because it is a custom piece and the material might be hard to find now, three months later Stan messaged me that he got the upholster and the exact material and ready to come pick up our couch to change the entire back side! Of course, we were pretty disappointed and frustrated about the situation, we weren't sure if he can really pull through better yet keep his words. I mean after 3 months, anyone would be nervous, a brand new couch with ripped corners. But Stan was a man or his words! And we both know the money he spent to keep his words was probably more than what I paid them when we hired them. I'm impressed and I can't thank Stan enough! I got my couch back brand new again!!!!! This kind of businessman needs to be applaud for his integrity. If anyone is reading my review, stop looking for other movers, I already dis the work for all of you! I called many companies and got quotes! You can find cheaper but could lack qualities! Stan and his team is quality with fair pricing! Trust is what you can have with this team! That when you move your memories from one place to another, you need someone trustworthy. Thanks Stan!</Review>

cannot recommend these guys enough for
an affordable and easy moving experience!
I recently moved from a studio form Irvine to
a one-bedroom in Azuza and most of the
movers I spoke with quoted me at somewhere
between $650 and $750. However, Titan
Relocation were at a much more reasonable
rate, and their maximum quote (for a worst-
case scenario) was at about $600, so I felt
comfortable hiring them for the job.
On the day of the move, I expected the guys
to arrive between 12-1 as schedule, but they
happily surprised me by arriving an hour
early. Everyone was so speedy and organized
that everything in my apartment was moved
and into the new apartment by 1PM--AKA
the time I originally expected them to
ARRIVE! Seriously, efficient is an
understatement.
After everything, my total came out to just
$450 plus tip. For everything these guys did,
what I paid was an absolute bargain, and the
next time I move I know who I'm calling.<//text>

We were looking for a good moving company  in Chino Hills for commercial move. Reasonable price, easy booking process and professional moving crew! Our office relocation have to take place after 5pm because of the building rules and Titan was able to accommodate this request.

Adrian and his crew are the best! All my belongings were packed in professional manner and arrived safe. Long story short - they were competent, fast and very friendly, so the stressful day become much better. BTW they provide free use of wardrobe boxes - that was a lifesaver for me because I have a tons of clothes! They saved me a lot of money and time.</review>

It is very important for us.\n\nWe always recommend to all our clients to use bigger crews.

<text>We paid close to 1400 for 3 movers to move our packed 3 bedroom home. It took them 10.5 hours!

Would we hire Titan Relocation again? Absolutely not. Would we recommend them? Only to our enemies.

How would I describe them in a few words? Careless, inefficient and unprofessional.

I won’t burden you with details (unless you want them see below) but let me say their carelessness is a gift that kept giving as we unpacked. We’ve had to replace several items as a result of their negligence. What a terrible experience and I’m the one who hired them.

Feels awful that my family members suffered loss and damages because I made such a poor hiring decision.

I hope our shared experience helps save at least one family, who is considering contracting w/Titan Relocation, from disappointment and financial burden imposed by hiring this inept crew.

I’ve since looked back on the negative reviews like this one and thought to myself, I too was warned. Live and learn.

Details of why we’re beyound dissatisfied and our time and money wasted:

Job was incomplete. Upon arriving at old home, after the movers arrived at our new home, I noticed a patio chair on the front lawn, lamps, shredder, art work, large framed photographs, patio furniture , pots and plants and other things were left behind. They didn’t say a word. We had to move them ourselves. Glad we had a truck.

Broke poster bed post (fixed thereafter by Stan and given a crisp $50 bill) glued and pinned isn’t ever gonna be the same structural integrity. The crew said at the time, it must’ve been old that’s why it broke. 3 years old tops. They were impatient and careless during disassembly. NOTE: Upon reassembly it was put together half-a$$ because it was broken in 2@3/4 sides. Resulting in a rod falling off thereafter and gouging our wall. Lucky no one was hurt.

Stripped bolts to T.V. Mount during disassembly (had to replace mount) Did not remount at new place...because they couldn’t. We were told the screws were stripped but not that they’d done it.

Bolts missing from lawn furniture (needs to be replace as it’s lopsided) No word about it from any of the guys, including the foreman.

Filing cabinet handled carelessly we had to turn sideways to gain access. Files in disarray. So much for being organized.

Credenza drawer obstructed because of poor handling.

Several heavy boxes were left in our garage when they were labeled to go in the house. We’ve had to dolly load several afterward. Why’d we pay $1400 again?

Shall I go on?

They unabashedly asked for bottled water and food. What professional company asks the client for these things? We gave, but I can tell you it was terribly off putting.

The foreman insisted that single items like bags and cases were ‘unpacked’ and it was gonna take them several hours longer as a result. We moved those ‘unpacked’ items ourselves to avoid additional charges. Never an issue w/ other moving companies.

This was a 4 man job and they were not only understaffed, they had hired another guy as a substitute from another moving company. Apparently they weren’t in sync.

The Master Bedroom mattress was crumpled to the point of ill repair. We’ve moved this mattress before with no problem. Should’ve rehired those movers. Sure they broke fewer items but weren’t nearly as improper in their care as this crew. Who knew the bar could get so much lower?

Clothes, belts and shoes carelessly thrown on the floor at the new place. I watch a guy walk on the clothes. It was a long day and I wanted this over and these guys gone.

That’s not all but I’m done with this terrible experience and want to move on.

We’re not entirely unpacked and I must say, I dread discovering more of their screw-up cover-ups.

I cringe at the thought of ever having done business with Titan Relocation, more than moving itself.< /text>< Date>

Excellent movers!!  Fast and efficient. They finished moving in 1.5 hours for 1 bedroom apartment. I didn't have to lift a finger and was sipping coffee along the way. Great experience.  Would highly recommend them again.<//Review>

They send a representative for free estimate and after I’ve booked they finished my move even in less hours than it was expected. 4 bedroom house worth of stuff was relocated in 8 hours, nothing broken and I’m very happy with Titan! They are the best Moving Company in Pomona area.< /text>

Stan and his team made the move incredibly easy. I moved out of an elevator building in Tustin and into a walk up in the Anaheim in 2.5 hours with very minimal involvement from me. They made moving look graceful and stress free which really helped with the entire process feel smooth and painless. Stan handled most of the logistics and was very responsive and clear about expectations while setting up the move. I found the price to be very reasonable and definitely worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.< /Review>

Perfect. I messaged ten or local moving companies (thanks for making it so easy Yelp!) about a week before my move asking for a quote. Most wrote back asking me to fill out long forms on their websites or call them directly for a quote but Veronica  from Titan Relocation wrote back immediately with a very good price so they were the obvious choice.
His crew of three guys were professional, fast, friendly, and were great with my stuff. Best movers ever. I'll only use Titan Relocations from now on<//Text>

<Review>I would like to thank Stan, Adrian and the third guy for help! They were sensitive to my requirements. Other than move itself I need an assembly of our new bunk bed and crib for the little one. They brought all the tools and finished assembly pretty quick, so we can use it same day.

Definitely would recommend Titan Relocation.

They arrived on time, were courteous, efficient and everything went very smoothly.

Titan was refereed by our friend who had used their services 6 months ago and also was very pleased with them.<//Review>

Booking a move with them was super easy. I loved how they were really precise with their quotes and really broke everything down with an easy online user interface. Their pricing is more transparent than other movers I requested quotes from, too.

The movers came a bit late because their truck broke down, but Veronica from the office gave me a headsup right away. During the move the guys were fast and very focused. Getting to know them was cool too - one of them is a singer!

Not only was Titan Relocations the most responsive movers, their quote was also the most reasonable for our move to an apartment 5 blocks away. There is no doubt we would be using them again for our next move.</Text>< pics>

They are very efficient, hard workers and also look the part of big strong movers. Very professional in wrapping and moving furniture and their work shows they've been doing this a while. I thought I got lucky with Agoura to Dimond Bar crew since it was a long haul but the local OC crew was just as good. They even told me about something that was damaged during the move that I would not have noticed and refunded a portion of the cost.

I wanted to match an existing custom sized framed kitchen cabinet for a kitchen remodel we’re doing. CabinetNow not only did such a small job but the price, quality and turnaround were amazing. I highly recommend.< /Review>

I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I ordered 4 drawer fronts and a cabinet for over my stove to hold one of those new low profile microwave/hood.  The cut out for the microwave had to be 14 inches deep, regular cabinets are 12 inches deep.  I sent in the measurements and my order was perfect.   It was packaged well and nothing was damaged during shipping.  I used the instructional video that is on the website to assemble my cabinet.   I ordered paintable Alder, cabinet matches my other cabinets too.  They arebalso face frames.<//Text>

<text>Great service, they keep me informed on the process of my order.
It is quit easy to fill in the request form for the size of the door I needed. The only hard part (for me) was trying to figure out what type of wood I needed. Fortunately I guess right as after staining the door it does match with the existing ones.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Nice to be able to just order the doors. One issue I had was that I chose “painted wood doors” and did not realize I had to make another choice beyond that between MDF and actual wood, I assumed wood meant wood. So I ended up with fiber board instead of maple, which was not what I wanted. No refunds though, understandable since they are custom- but the ordering process could be a bit more clear on that issue.< /text>

I called with the dimensions I needed. The person I spoke with was very helpful and a great help in ordering what I needed. My product arrived before I expected it. The only down side was I received shipping notice 2 weeks after I got it. I would have liked to know it was coming before, but I'm not complaining. I would gladly use them again.<//Review>

<Text>I recently ordered two simple doors, unfinished.  The doors in and of themselves were of decent quality, but the time till shipment was 15 days.  I get it, COVID, but the website does not reflect that.  What more, the borehole pattern was wrong on one door.  In short, I could use only one door.  I brought this to the attention of customer service, and was told that I could wait 3 more weeks for another door or receive a refund on merely the borehole service, not the actual cost of the defective door.  Given the precision needed in cabinet manufacturing, I cannot recommend this vendor.

Update: According to CS: "According to our terms of service we don't provide refunds."  Caveat emptor</Text>< pics>

I was very worried ordering a cabinet door to match my other cabinets.  The process was easy and the workmanship was fantastic.  The door is perfect, the process didn't take very long to get it.  I already recommend this company to others.</Review>

<name>Eddie Parker< /name><Text>I was looking to help a friend upgrade their kitchen.  Reviewed the "big box" stores for prefabbed units.  The kitchen was in need of a complete rebuild.  Jason from CabinetNow was very helpful in taking our measurements and pictures, turning them into a very complete design.  He then helped us order all the components we needed.  We did have an issue with the shipper (not CabinetNow's fault) but CN came through and replaced the damaged pieces very quickly.  Once received, the install took a week to assembly all the cabinets and install doors, drawers and drawer fronts.  Very good experience.  Will use them again!</Text>< rate>

<Text>Drawer Box ordered was received with a broken corner. Customer service offered a credit of what I paid toward a replacement. However, when I asked that the new box be a slightly different size (and offered to pay the extra), they said No!  Somebody in charge needs to Google the word Credit.

Anyway, I managed to buy the replacement drawer box from a competitor.

So much for “Customer Service”! I’ll be sure to let my fellow neighbors know about this. It’s a 20 yr old subdivision with 500 homes, and rather “close knit”, via the widely used Nextdoor app.<//Text><Rate>1</Rate><user_id>110030178290823989050<//user_id>< username>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>I have placed multiple orders totaling thousands of dollars through CabinetNow.Com and they have usually seemed to be pretty customer oriented. I called today to check on the status of an order I placed 9 business days ago and was told it would not ship out for 3 more weeks. I unfortunately have a deadline with a customer a week from today so this was not going to work and I would need to build the 7 drawer boxes myself. I asked them since the webpage I ordered from said it would take 6-10 days if there was a reason they wouldn't reach out to notify me of the delay. They said that this was not something they do. I let them know that I would have to cancel my order as the drawer boxes would not arrive in the timeframe they offered. I was told the order could not be canceled and no refund would be issued. I found this very frustrating as the boxes were not cut or built since they were still 3 weeks away from shipping me the 7 drawer boxes I ordered. It's sad to see that they would be willing to loose a customer over something that would not cost them any money. I would highly recommend using a local cabinet shop or a different company if timing, communication and integrity are important to you.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Door is clearly the wrong one, I even sent pics of the one I ordered and of my existing door, the inside profile has 3 ridges, I have attached the pics, someone tell me they are the same, clearly they are not, they keep telling me they are the same, one on the right is the one from there Website used to base my order on, one on the left is the door they sent me.

Step forward, I sent an updated Pic to them and its being reviewed.

Was reviewed, they say its the door I ordered, again, the door on the left is what I based my order on and the one on the right is what they sent me and it is clearly not the same so it is not what I ordered!

One of the cabinet stores agent I visited suggested to check online for half the price I will pay to any local cabinet stores for replacement cabinet door and drawer front. I found the closest match on cabinetnow for half the price and now installed to my kitchen cabinet. Just give two weeks at least to receive shipping which is similar wait time to what local LOWE’s told me too.< /Review>

<name>Steven K Upton<//name><date>1567368233443</date><Review>I ordered a pair of doors to match some existing cabinets and I did so using my phone. That was my first mistake! The web site is a bit vague with pictures of general products but they don’t change as you choose your specific items. Since I was using my phone the pictures were small and I ended up choosing the wrong item, all my fault!
But that’s not my issue with these guys. I called to try and figure out how to get what I needed and the rep (Brook) agreed that the web site could be confusing and should be better designed.
I asked if there was anything that could be done to replace the doors. She stated that no was there that could make such a decision so she would call me in the morning after speaking with a boss. She did not! I called back later in the day after giving her the entire day to get back to me.
I spoke to a rep that said Brook was finishing up a call and she would call me right back, she did not!
The order mistake was mine, but when an internet company lacks in the customer service area of the business that is all I need to know concerning whether to continue doing business with them.
I was going to reorder the doors whether they offered to cover some of the cost or not, that won’t be the case now.

Update.....

After writing this review I received a phone call within two days of the review, the representative stated that the customer service I received was not the kind of customer service I deserved. He asked me how he could help resolve the matter, I ask him how he would like to resolve the matter, at that point he offered to remake the doors  at no cost to me, in addition he sent the correct doors which were actually an upgrade from the doors I had selected and ask for no additional monies for the upgrade. This is excellent customer service and they are to be commended for the follow up and ultimately how they handled the problem. As a carpenter with 35+ years experience I can tell you the quality of these doors is exceptional and I assume the balance of their inventory is equally as well-built. Thank you for handling my problem the way you did and in an expeditious fashion!</Review>< UserId.>

<Review>I used their doors & drawer faces to remodel a 1980's kitchen using the original ugly dark brown cabinets. Their doors are an almost exact match to the current cabinets being sold at the big box hardware stores. They are at least the same quality, but I actually think they are higher quality. Their support people helped me find the correct edge profile (there are many, but there are only a few that are really popular at the big box stores right now). The items came quicker than I expected. The big box stores no longer offer this service where you can order doors only. I saved money by buying my hinges locally, and bored my own concealed hinge holes. This also allowed me to choose between 1/2 and 3/4" offset on my old cabinet frames, as I wasn't exactly sure how the doors would lay out. I ended up using 1/2" offset and one door at the end is 3/4" offset. They look perfect, like the factory.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I did an entire kitchen doors, drawer fronts, including glass doors.  The fit and construction was excellent. you have to be very explicit re: sizes and where holes etc.; Consumer service is great.  Quality is very good and shipping very efficient, well packed.  Would definitely use again.  Good prices.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<username>Jeff S<//username><date>1537332479286<//date><Rating>5</Rating><text>Cabinet Wow seems like a more appropriate name. I have no affiliation whatsoever with them and they just built 2 cherry doors and a drawer front for me. Zena was a big help and sent an email msg to confirm my mismatched choice between the doors and the drawer front. Everything arrived very, very well packaged and the cardboard everything was wrapped in served perfectly as a drop cloth for staining and finishing.  The parts were cut extremely precise, fit perfectly, and their website had plenty of guidance for measuring properly. They did a very good job of trying to match grain patterns and the cherry was top quality.  While I did sand before staining, it probably wasn’t even necessary. They pre-bored the holes for my Euro-style hinges and they too were perfect. I may be a touch biased but my bathroom vanity turned out to be nothing less than astonishing, thanks in large part to Cabinet Now.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

EVERYTHING on site is ultra fresh. There is a wide selection of entrees and meals. They maintain a fresh salsa bar, all you can eat style. All of the portions are fit for a king (a hungry king! One meal could be enough for my wire and I, but everything taste so good that I don't want to share! 😁
The staff is very professional and not pushy.
Pricing is mid-range, with 2 meals (for 2 people) is around $20.
Five star rating.</review>

How the restaurant was designed seem a little strange, the queue management for the line didn't seem well thought out. I like the salsa bar. In general the food wasn't bad or amazing. Good place to go for a general lunch.< /Review>

<text>For fast food, this place is awesome. The food is fresh and incredibly hot when you get it, and they make that part of their promise to their clients. Also, this particular location had people staffing it that were very friendly & pleasant, which is always a plus as far as I'm concerned. I had the rojo enchiladas, and they were delicious, not too heavy, and (with the black beans and rice) very filling. I particularly love churros, and these were exceptional - very, very hot, generously dusted with cinnamon sugar, and light and crispy on the inside - my favorite! The full meals are enormous, so I always have some leftovers to take home and nibble afterwards!</text>< Date>

Gluten free options available. Stay away from the chips, fried in the same fryer as non-gluten free food. Place is clean but a bit wornout.</review>

I am vegan and I have been eating and this chain of Restaurants  for the past six months the staff always treated me like a human being but at  this location they close 30 minutes earlier I rushed to get to the restaurant on  time and I find that the door was closed I knock at the door and the guy that the cash register was just counting his money and he ignore me he knew  I was there is standing at the door had the decency to turn around and let me know what was a problem what is close early I have to call and he told me that it was just is slow and they  decide to close early</text>

This location is doing their own thing, like having an ice cream freezer and winging it with salsas. Came at an off hour and got a typical hot burrito. Friendly staff< /text>

<text>I received some of the best customer service I have ever had from my tech (Devon) and his supervisor (Scott). Aside from being very knowledgeable and professional, they both went ABOVE & BEYOND to get my service installed. MANY thanks to both of you. You are both tremendous assets for the company and the type of employees that make a business a success. I hope that someone "higher up" in the company actually reads this and acknowledges both of you for a job well done........<//text><rating>5<//rating><pics>None<//pics><Date>1495135146823<//Date>< Gmap_id>

People aren't too friendly. I just had to go there and replace the controlee and expected the guy to at least say good afternoon how are you doing. Or ask about what I was returning and why, but not. A nice clean place though I'd give him that. For the amount that you pay is like small car payment for a month , they should be a little bit nicer.<//Review>

My experience with comcast has been I had a package that was roughly 70$ a month for roughly a year.  Then after a year they jacked lt up to 108$ and said we sent you an email saying the package expired.  When I questioned customer service on the price hike they told me comcast has to many customers to give anyone specific any actual attention.  After a frustrating phone call I went to a store to solve the problem in person.  There they informed me that to have the price I had before I had to decrease my speed.  I am now paying the same price for lower quality.  Customer service was fine everyone I talked to was friendly but all said that the issues I faced were company policy.  First chance I get to find a new company I will switch.  I gave two stars for the customer service trying to help but being unable to work with a conglomerate that apparently does not care about it's customers.< /review>

<Text>This company has poor customer service, the office is too small, and they sneak extra fees into your bill without telling you upfront. Also, after doing a speed check multiple times on my internet, it reaches only occasionally what I paid for.  False advertising! Go with ATT or Syix instead!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

The waiters  collaborated in a gorgeous way, the meals were delicious and my friends were very  cheerful. We shall absolutely come back again for more celebrations. thanks very much.<//Review>< gmap_id>

First time stopping by here. Went through drive-through. They were good with timing even though it was during the lunch rush. The food though was over done. Ordered Chicken strips and they were dark and hard. Definitely left in the fryer too long. Its a bit farther from work than other restaurants i frequent so not likely to return to this one again.<//review>

It's Jack's. This one tries to stay clean and gets your order out pretty quickly. Inside the dining area is pretty small but they do offer free wifi. You will find younger kids here, drunks and people, how shall I say, down on their luck trying to make ends meet. But they haven't bothered me the times I come here. I lucked out today and got all three, just this visit there were some transients here with a cat that smelled real bad that got loose, then a drunk older man came in from the beach and just a few minutes after that two young kids came in with a rolling boom box. A trifecta!! Your luck may vary. To avoid this just hit the drive thru.</Text>

It's 12:22am and I'm waiting for my food when I ordered it at 11:30pm. Called them and got voicemail and called again and asked about my order on Uber eats and was told that there was no order placed when it clearly states that my order is being made on my Uber Eats app.<//text>

After watching a movie went for food. Wow this person wasn't listening had to repeat several times one item. Wanted to order one more item and they didn't have any egg rolls. Pretty irritating.</Text>

<Review>The best items for me is the chicken sandwich (well done) hold the Mayo and lettuce (please and thank you).
The tacos are always a hit and have tasted the same ever since I could remember, I also like the curly fries.

I don't eat it often but if I stroll on by then that is likely what I'll get, oh or you can go a bit up on price and try out the Jack's spicy chicken.< /Review>< Pics>

Always very nice and my orders are always correct. Except this last time. I was asked to confirm order on the screen while in drive-thru. Honestly I couldn't see the numbers because the screen is messed up, so they made me a double order of burgers.
PLEASE fix your drive-thru order screen to save time and end confusion. TY :)< /review>

The 1 i used looked out of order as well. I was OK with her letting me know someone was waiting. But the tone she used In the added part "your taking too long." Felt a little out of hand And inconsiderate, She didn't know what I had to go through to just use that restroom. So after that I didn't trust them to make my food anymore!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Jack is fast food at its finest. Comes out hot and greasy plus high in calories but very reasonable especially on their weekly specials. If you're short on coin would recommend Jack<//Text>

Pretty nice small, I usually go thru drive thru but I wanted to go inside. It's a bit short staff, don't really keep up with cleaning the tables. There is a lady quite big with blonde/black hair didn't like with a nose piercing. Not sure if she was already upset but did not like how she didn't have the patience for an elderly woman that she was having a hard time placing her pin #.< /review>

< Review>
Only a month ago I really liked the food and service here. Something changed big time since then. What happened to the fast, friendly, efficient teenagers that used to work here? They served fast, HOT, FRESH food all this time until a few weeks ago. Big crew change. Not the ones I rated well a month ago. New crew is slow. Tonight, I waited 5 minutes just to get old, stale fries and the burger was NOT EVEN HOT. I thought you had to serve food at a certain HOT temperature, not one sitting under the "keep warm" lights for awhile. I also notice LIGHT TRAFFIC for a Saturday night, too. WHAT HAPPENED? Was there a change in ownership? Big mistake to change the old crew of kids. THEY knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, the new crew is slow, not too efficient. My burger paper wrap had ketchup smeared on it, but I especially didn't like that my burger was lukewarm and fries were old. Tells me that they lost some regular customers, judging from the lack of traffic, sitting in my car and eating. Too bad. I liked this place for years.<//Review>

< review>
Have gone here regularly since 1995, when I met my wife. The past few visits were far less than satisfactory.
I will only speak to yesterdays visit, when I was particularly hungry having been busy all morning.
I purchased a Sourdough Jack and a Sriracha Burger. My wife ordered a Sourdough Grilled Chicken Jack. All three sandwiches did not have their bread toasty as they usually do. I knew something was up when the cheese wasn't melty as it usually is. Unfortunately, as stated I ate it anyway as I was hungry.
Got sick that evening. This wasn't a first for getting ill from this particular Jack In The Box.
Needless to say, my family and I will not be returning here. Which is sad in a sense, considering how many years we've been visiting.< /review>

My favorite is the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. Yummy!!  The combo includes an Egg Roll & a small drink.

My only complaint is that when you increase the size of the combo they do not give you additional Egg Rolls.  If you upsize a sandwich combo, they increase the size of your drink AND the size of your fries.  If you order a medium size Chicken Teriyaki Bowl Combo you should get 2 Egg Rolls & a medium size drink.  If you order a large size, you should get 3 Egg Rolls & a large size drink.

Fair is fair.</review>

Visually seeing two employees.    If you are supposed to open your doors at 6 am and the second employee is on the clock untill the replacement employee arrives should continue business as usual. Since she is behind the counter moving supplies around leaves me only to assume that she is also still on the clock.< /Text>< GmapID>

Came thru here a few times say about 440 am to order breakfast. 3 times I have been told, we are not making that right now regarding the meat lovers burrito and another time I ordered the hotcakes with bacon meal and was told we are not serving that today so I ask why and was told it was because they didnt have the lids. Really? Goodbye Jack in the Box too much of a disappointment.  Went to the other one near my work and drove in the drive thru about a 440 and just sat there waiting and waiting and no one ever took my order drove to the window and no one in site, however, there was a delivery being made. Hmm....whats up JB? Went to McDonalds instead across the street<//text>
