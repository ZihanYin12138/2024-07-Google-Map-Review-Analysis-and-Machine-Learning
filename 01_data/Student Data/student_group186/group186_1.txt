Mr Sergio Siderman really got our family’s hopes up and my moms as well. It was a waste of money honestly we tried to contact them in the office but it would always say it was closed and the secretary would just say that they have not gotten any news or reports about my moms case. Until one day we checked our mail it was a letter saying that my moms case will not continue and that it had been dropped we finally gave up and right now we are working on my moms case she found a better attorney pls don’t contact him he would just scam your own money and you’ll be disappointed.</text>< response>

I wouldn’t recommend this attorney to anyone. It’s been 3 years that I open the case for my husband. The only reason we hired this attorney was because it was recommended. I’m very upset because between those 3 years we got a letter from NVC dismissing our case. This attorney said he was going to take care of everything. Which apparently he did not, because they dismissed my husbands case, now He has to START ALL OVER. I have tried contacting them for updates. They NEVER gave me a reasonable answer.  Their respond would always be the same...
( will contact you when we have updates) we invested a lot of money into this, that at the end of everything he has to start all over again. I HARDLY WOULDN’t RECOMMEND THIS ATTORNEY TO ANYONE...</Text>

<review>Trying to contact this office takes months. My father and I had high expectations from this place. When we first started off with this office it was great, but after that trying to contact them was impossible! I would text /call/ email but no one would answer me. I would leave them messages and nothing ! Finally when you get in contact with them they pick up with a attitude and when you ask for information from them they take a whole other year to contact you back or don’t bother contacting you back. Except to play phone tag with them. I contact them 8 months ago for some information I needed and I’m still waiting for it. I’ve called so many times I’ve memorized the number at this point. Also expect  any time you have a appointment to wait 1 hour just trying to get up to the floor because staff won’t come down for you until a hour later. I’m very disappointed and in happy with the service.</review>< rating>

I'm very happy with the help that everyone here provided me with. Walked me through the whole process and answered all my questions. I felt very cared for and appreciated here; they always made me feel reassured when I had doubts about anything. I definitely recommend coming here for guidance, I'm very happy with the help I received!<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80c2c7bd35714621:0xc1642b1c7c6b1ff8<//GmapID><review>VERY SLOPPY SERVICE. This office advertises that if they can't help you no one else can. NOT TRUE. I  hired them over 5 months ago - gave them $1,000 retainer for finger prints to renew my resident card. They never contacted me on my case. I went to their office and the receptionist gave me a vibe as if I were bothering her. I guess they are used to working with people that don't ask questions. Anyway, I got desperate and tired on waiting around for them at least a phone call. But,  it never happen. Just now I, received a call from their office that they need additional paperwork for my file. I told them the service at that office is no good and unprofessional. Three months ago I walked into another lawyers office and filled out one piece of paper and paid another retainer fee. Two weeks ago I received my new resident card in the mail Hassel - free. Whoever decides to work with this office please ask around for references and past experiences. Don't hand over your hard working money that easy. Take your time. Remember they have a license to legally rip people off.</review>< UserId.>

He is the most lawyer who steals and lies to people.  I had been waiting for two years for them to do something with my process and all they did was get money from me.  and my new lawyer realized that they literally did nothing in the case ... and in two months my process with my new lawyer has advanced more than with Sergio Siderman's Rat ... Please do not go there, they are inept.  the only thing they do is take away your money and time.<//Text>

I applied to work here and I got called back for the job but I turned it down because everyone I came into contact with looked like they hated their job. They really underpay their employees too. No wonder nobody wants to answer the phones, they feel like they don’t get paid enough.
I saw them turn away 3 people just while I sat there they told them to leave because there was nobody to help them with their questions and to come back another time. Don’t they realize that these people work and can’t be coming back to the office everyday until they find someone that can answer their questions.
I wouldn’t want to work in a place that doesn’t make time for their clients, mainly when it comes to their legal status. I’m glad I turned it down.< /review>

<review>Don't trust this immigration office not only do they waste your time asking for paperwork and fingerprints but they lie promising you that they guarantee your case will be approved IF you give all the required payments. My mom gave them over 4k in contract payments to only tell her that her case was not approved. Very disappointed because they promised my mom residency she came to US legally and has been here for 35 years working almost every single day with those 35 years. Overall please anybody who wants to help a family member with their residence or citizenship DO NOT come here they are only stealing peoples hard earn money.</review>< gmap_id>

Really bad service, never answer your questions. They just get your money and when you try to contact them , they just ignore you. Don’t go there, get a lawyer that really cares about you. Mal servicio solo les importa el dinero. No revisan su caso y no responden sus preguntas. Busquen otro abogado que si tenga interés por su caso.< /Text>

<user>103157342098503948989<//user><Text>Very sloppy service like the previous comments say! This lawyer did a horrible job representing my mom. If anything, he made her life an awful experience due to not doing their job right. My mother is now being deported because they did not do their job right and send my mom to her interview to fail when the lawyer should have known from the start she did not qualify. This lawyer had his license suspended in the past as well. So stay away from this company.

Trust me; they did a horrible job. Now I have to spend another 10k to fix his mistakes<//Text></record>

Very disappointed with this firm my mother chose after hearing about it on the radio. Very poor attention to detail, no responsiveness, and only urgency to collect money. We’ve been trying to have some type of progress the last couple of years and nothing. We’ve made our payments diligently often times paid multiple contracts in full upfront with hopes of some type of legal assistance. My mom and I have called several times and never has been able to speak with anyone or meet with anyone in person and just get the run around. We have a few months left with a current contract paid in full and if we still have no progress we’ll have to move on with a different attorney and accept the fact that thousands of dollars were just taken with very very little in return. Our family is extremely disappointed and feel like my mom was taken advantage of after trying our best to work with this firm and spending almost 6k.</text>

<text>Everyone in the office very nice and helpful specially Mayra. Since my first phone call I was amazed on how patience Mayra was with me answering all my 1000 questions, I do ask a lot of questions. My husband case was successfully approved and the process went smoothly. Every time I called I was able to speak to someone who helped me and if needed I was able to schedule an appointment in office.  I could not believe how fast the case was approved.

I have nothing but great experience with this firm and a special THANKS to Mayra, I do not know what i would have done with out your help. I strongly recommend this firma for any immigration legal matter.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My mom went in to see Sergio Siderman after hearing him on the radio and gave her a free consultation. I went in with her to ask questions because so many people were telling us I couldn’t help her. I took my brother and mom with me where to the follow up appointment and Alex and Mayra attended us  and were very helpful and informative. Luckily, Sergio was just getting back from court so I got to meet him as well. They’ve been helping us through this process and my mom just got her approval in the mail for her residency! I’m so happy! I highly recommend them!!!</text>

They returned my many phone calls and replied back to e-mails in a quick manner!! Highly recommend their services to anyone in need of legal help!<//Text>

<review>Sergio is an understanding, bilingual, and honest attorney who cares about you and your case. He makes sure he does his best to help the person and runs a full background check before doing a case. Lucky for me and my boyfriend he ran the record so we found out what we could do before he started. Now my boyfriend has his residency and didn’t have to leave the country like everyone told us. I’m so happy with Sergio!< /review>< Pictures>

Sergio is an excellent attorney who helped me and my wife with our papers. She’s a happy citizen now, and I have my residency. I had gone to other famous attorneys but told me they couldn’t because I had gotten caught coming in. Then I met Sergio. I’m glad my wife saw him on the news and decided to come here. He ran my background check and records first and then gave me the good news. This is the happiest review I’ve ever written!</text>

Sergio is an excellent attorney who cares about his clients. I’ve personally had my cases dealt by him and have had other friends also come to him and we’ve all left happy. He takes his time to review your case and prepare it right. Definitely recommend everyone!< /Review>

<Review>What can I say.. Sergio is a dream attorney. I've never met someone so passionate about what he does. He has multiple offices and opens 7 days a week and even offers you payment plans! Sergio, thank you so much for helping me petition my parents for their residency. We just got back from our vacation- something they never experienced in their life. Sergio made it possible.

<date>1539625808311</date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>This is the worst law office, please be careful. So we sat down with Sergio himself for the consultation and told us all we wanted to hear. We paid$500 in advance that day. After that they would always call us telling us they need the rest of the money so they can start the process and the sooner the have money the sooner they can get our papers. Me and my husband actually took out a loan so we can't get started we paid cash. After that day we never heard from them, we will always call and leave messages, for 3 months we did not hear anything, till 1 day the paralegal calls us and tell us he's been waiting for more information. So we make an appointment with him take the information and also ask for a check for $500 to submit the paperwork, again we give the check. Another 2 months roll by with no calls. That when I had it. I call to complain and they transfer me to the paralegal that tells me they can do anything with our case sorry.... just like that. This place is taking advantage of people who don't know better and the people that work there are all very rude. But today I will file a complaint to the states layer discipline agency.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2c7bd35714621:0xc1642b1c7c6b1ff8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I wish to thank Sergio and his staff for an excellent experience. My husband and I were lost with our case and had no idea how to resolve it but Sergio took the time to go through every step needed to get my husband his papers. I am endlessly grateful! I will always recommend my family and friends!<//review>

The girls in the front desk are not the best with customer service. They dont even welcome you or say how can i help u? they just stare at you like what do you want. Communication problems need to be addressed And if u try to complain nothing gets done. But as paying customers you should get the best service possible. Other than that service's are ok.< /Review>

You DO NOT have to be a citizen to do so  . Stand up for yourself , you did not come this far to be taken advantage of by this person and his employees! There is to many case negligence reports against them, and just because the agreement says non refundable doesn’t mean it’s true ! If they took money from you and you never saw a single attorney or case #  they did NOT EARN UPON RECEIPT !

(Translated by Google) Bad service, they call themselves friends of the community and the only thing that matters to them is money, when I know. The case implies they only refer it to another lawyer, and thus they end the problem, this type of lawyers without worse than what they call fill out papers.

(Original)
Mal servicio, se dicen amigos de la comunidad y lo único que les importa es el dinero, cuando se. Implica el caso sólo lo refieren a otro abogado, y así terminan el problema, este tipo de abogados sin peor que los que ellos llaman llena papeles.</text>

(Translated by Google) I am happy with Attorney Sergio SIDERMAN and all his staff, especially Attorney Reyna and Ms. Paralegal Sonia Alvarado. They worked very hard on my case and I have a month to take my residency. It is a good law firm. Thank you very much🙏🏻 I'm super happy 😀👍

We are Mexicans and they told us that if my daughter could request for us and at the very hour when we take the payment for the weyas they tell us that the one who was handling the case is no longer here. And they do not answer us by telephone and in person they do not help us. Please do not come here they only take your money. Trust me save yourself time and go with someone legit because this is a scam. This law firm is a fake hype.

(Translated by Google) Leaving a review on behalf of a friend who came to me after turning to Sergio Siderman for help obtaining her DACA status with some details that were troubling and warranted a deeper look into his past. What I've found is disturbing. This man has preyed upon his own people during their time of need and he's done nothing for them besides steal and betray in the most unethical ways. There's a reason his license was revoked in 2008 and was ineligible to practice law in the state of California. Take the time to read his reviews here on Google as well as Yelp, Avvo and the Better Business Bureau and you will learn the truth. And it's also very obvious that any positive reviews are more than likely fake. It's no coincidence that a five-star review comes shortly after a slew of honest, negative reviews in an attempt to make to balance out. It's too late now though because the truth is out and there's no turning back. Unfortunately for those whom he's promised yet not delivered, they're the one who have suffered; including my friend.

Dejando una reseña en nombre de un amigo que vino a verme después de recurrir a Sergio Siderman en busca de ayuda para obtener su estado DACA con algunos detalles que eran preocupantes y que justificaban una mirada más profunda a su pasado.  Lo que encontré es perturbador.  Este hombre se ha aprovechado de su propia gente durante su tiempo de necesidad y no ha hecho nada por ellos además de robar y traicionar de las formas más poco éticas.  Hay una razón por la que su licencia fue revocada en 2008 y no era elegible para ejercer la abogacía en el estado de California.  Tómese el tiempo para leer sus reseñas aquí en Google, así como en Yelp, Avvo y Better Business Bureau y aprenderá la verdad.  Y también es muy obvio que cualquier crítica positiva es muy probable que sea falsa.  No es una coincidencia que una revisión de cinco estrellas se produzca poco después de una serie de críticas honestas y negativas en un intento de equilibrarlo.  Sin embargo, ahora es demasiado tarde porque la verdad está fuera y no hay vuelta atrás.  Desafortunadamente para aquellos a quienes él prometió pero no cumplió, son los que han sufrido;  incluido mi amigo.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Not recommended this "law office" a woman named Rosa is very rude and cutting ... and to be honest I ended my case with them for this little person ... I recommend that the lawyer look for professionals to answer calls. To be able to speak with a representative, you take up to a week trying because they do not answer you. You leave a deposit and it is stolen due to their own ineptitude. Horrible service .. LOOK FOR ANOTHER LAWYER !!!!

(Translated by Google) I want to comment that when I arrived at the San Bernardino office they treated me very well, which made a good impression on me and I hired their services, however now on more than 2 occasions when my wife had the need to contact the office and seek to give a payment, they were very rude and even despotic to my wife, being that if I liked something it was the confidence that they inspired me to be a client, I hope that detail is taken into account. In advance I thank you atte.

Of course, if you don't pay, they will call you to remind you of your payment like any other place. At least I am very happy to have come and I gladly invite all family members, friends, acquaintances and countrymen of our community to trust this lawyer who is also an immigrant like us !!

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend it. Today I was in the office of this lawyer in Van Nuys CA and a guy attended me, in a very derogatory and sharp way.

It was a total waste of time. Lawyer Siderman did not attend to me but another guy who has no way of treating people and offers no solution to your case.

(Original)
No lo recomiendo. Hoy estuve en la Oficina de este abogado en Van Nuys CA y me atendió un tipo,  de manera muy despectiva y tajante.

Fue una pérdida de tiempo total. No me atendió el Abogado Siderman sino otro tipo que  no tiene manera de tratar a las personas y no te ofrece ninguna solución a tu caso.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) A lousy customer service, they do not know how to inform you the time of your appointment. I think that to take a law office seriously they should have trained personnel to help you. I had to cancel the appointment and go to my current and recognized attorney as well. If customer service doesn't take your questions seriously I think your cases less.

(Original)
Un servicio al cliente pésimo, no saben informarte la hora de tu cita. Pienso que para tomar en serio una oficina de abogados deberían tener personal capacitado para ayudarte.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Having a personal experience with this attorney, I highly recommend them! It was the best investment of money and time to legalize me. And yes, my case took a year and a half, but after waiting almost 20 years, waiting 1 more year was mild! I recommend it to my entire Hispanic community! Give it a try with someone who does! Thanks Sergio for my work permit and re-residence!

(Translated by Google) I really do not recommend them
They lack too much experience
After spending almost $ 2500 dollars in the first process they told me they could not help me

It is incredible how they deceive us on the radio saying they can help us

(Original)
Yo la verdad no los recomiendo
Les falta demasiada experiencia
Después de aver gastado casi $2500 dólares en el primer proceso me dijeron me no podían ayudarme

Es increíble como nos engañan en la radio diciendo le ellos pueden ayudarnos<//review>

(Translated by Google) The Immigration law firm has not been able to help me get my work permit, they lost my files and told me to wait a month and it has been more than a year and nothing, and they are very rude the secretariats have no education

El bufete de abogados de Imigracion no me han podido ayudar a sacar mi permiso de trabajo, ellos perdieron mi archivos y me dijeron que esperara un mes y ya paso más de un año y nada, y son  bien groseras las secretarías no tienen nada de  educación< /Text>

I was looking for a graduation lei, and I was having trouble finding one locally. I came across Glendale Florist, and I saw online that they carried them. I called in to confirm the color that I wanted and to check availability for the very next day and they said it would be no problem. The lei came packaged beautifully, and looked fantastic. Very happy with my first experience, I will definitely be returning for any future flower needs.</review>

I called them before they even open and Art picked up and was very helpful in making sure that my order would be delivered before noon even though they were very backed up since it was Mother's Day weekend. I really appreciated his efforts, not to mention the arrangement was so much bigger and nicer (if you can believe it) than the one in the photo. The vase is one that is worth keeping. It's good quality and very pretty.Thank you Art!< /review>

<Review>...exceptional product and service offering. We ordered flowers over the phone from an out-of-state location. The Gendale Florist representative was very patient with our order request and delivered a beautiful arrangement for our party within a few hours! ...definitely on our list of go-to florists in the area if we need one in the future. Well done!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

First time using this florist.   The arrangement was spectacular; my girlfriend was thrilled; and the true test is that the arrangement looked even better in person than in the picture.  High 5 star rating.<//Review>

One of the rare times the actual product was better than the online photo.  I ordered an arrangement for a friend’s birthday. When I received the BloomSnap after delivery, I was very doubtful that that was what had been delivered. The photo was just too professional-looking and the arrangement seemed to be better than what I thought I ordered. Still, I prayed that the final product would be at least half of what the BloomSnap showed.

When my friend sent me the photo of what she received, lo and behold, it was the exact arrangement pictured in the “professional-looking” photo!  I couldn’t believe it. It’s a shame I don’t actually live in California or else I would have found my new florist...</review>

Glendale Florist is by far the BEST florist in Glendale.  They knock it out of the park every time I order from them - I actually have them as a personal contact.  The designers are extremely talented and collaborative.  They let you know via text when your order leaves their shop, and arrives at the final destination.  Amazing!!  Paul< /review>

<user_name>Krystal Chea< /user_name><time>1607672955042<//time><rate>5</rate><Review>This is an overdue review. One morning I was searching and searching for a flower shop in the Glendale area. Many said they were open, but they were not. As I continued looking through Yelp, I came across this treasured flower shop. I wanted to get my mom flowers just because. I wanted to surprise her and make her day. This place did just that! Surprised her and made her day.

I was not sure what to get my mom. However, the florist made the process so easy. She surprised me with a beautiful arrangement. I am so glad she has a keen eye for detail and knew exactly what a customer wants to gift to others.

I would highly recommend My Glendale Florist for any of your floral needs in the Glendale area.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
My Glendale Florist is the ONLY florist that I will use in my local area.  I wish I could send their flowers to my friends all around the country.  There is a special talent they have which make bouquets of flowers come to life.  What I also love is their attention to detail with the logistics/shipping of the products.  I get a picture of the bouquet when complete and then tracking to know when they are on the way and confirmation of drop off.  The customer service is exceptional.  Highly suggest!!</Review>

I can't praise My Glendale Florist enough!  Not only are their arrangements gorgeous, but their dedication to top-tier customer service is simply impeccable.  Sam in particular impressed me to no end.  She is a kind, helpful, patient individual who truly goes above and beyond to ensure your arrangements are delivered to uplift your loved ones. Do not miss the opportunity to do business with My Glendale Florist!</review>

<review>I love this local Flower shop.  I have ordered couple of times from My Glendale Florist and they have always made beautiful arrangements.  What you see and pay in the pictures, is what you get.  I am very happy with their delivery service as well.  They notify you step-by-step as soon as your flowers leave the store and reach the destination.  They pay attention at the notes put in and if necessary, they will call you if they do not have a particular vase or flower.  Good communication, excellent service and reasonable pricing.  I will highly recommend them.  Thank you!< /review>< Pics>

<review>My mother just passed and I wanted to thank her friend for being such an amazing help. We ordered a beautiful bouquet and the delivery was exactly what was on the website. We felt like we got our money and then some. The recipient was so surprised and loved them. Plus, I could track with here the delivery was on its way to the location and who it was given to. I think I found my new florist!

I live in Australia and I've been using Glendale Florist to send flowers to my loved ones in the US for a couple of years now, as they do such a great job.
This time I had a problem trying to add an item to my order and used the online helpers at the florist to try and solve the problem.  I cannot over-emphasise the support they provided in trying to overcome the issue.  In fact after I gave up, they kept on trying and managed to rectify the problem whilst I slept.  The next morning, I decided to try again and lo - they had already added the item to my order.
The staff are incredibly helpful and professional and I give the establishment five gold stars for their service, not to mention the beautiful flower arrangements they deliver.
Best ever.< /Text>

I keep coming back (online, because I'm on the other side of the country) to Glendale Florist year after year because they've never disappointed me. Their bouquets are beautiful and their delivery is timely. I highly recommend them. They are consistently excellent.</Text>

I sent a bouquet with some chocolates to a friend who lives in Glendale (I live in San Francisco). This was my first time ordering flowers and it was so easy! They arrived same-day and my friend loved them.< /review>

Glendale Florist exceeded my expectations- while ordering an arrangement for my grandmother's funeral, they called to make sure they had all the information they needed to coordinate with the funeral home and texted when it was delivered. When we arrived, I was floored by how beautiful the arrangement was- it was even better than the picture. They added other blooms that were beautiful (and this was with the standard order, not deluxe). My mom, who wasn't keen on getting flowers in the first place, was so thankful that we did. She loved them and thought the arrangement was the perfect way to show our love for such an amazing woman in our lives. I also loved that they include a personalized banner with the arrangement, something that a lot of florist, especially online orders, don't include. I highly recommend Glendale Florist, and will be coming back to them when I need flowers for any occasion.< /text>

<Text>Best family-owned flower shop in Glendale, bar none. Have gotten Mother's Day and Valentines Day flowers for the two most important women in my life there,  will continue to do so because they make me look good. Art, the owner, bends over backward to make your arrangements a work of art. If you need to make a quick stop to pick up a bouquet or need something in a few weeks, they're the people you need to see. I can't stress enough how wonderful these people are. 10 stars!!! 🌟</Text></record>

I’ve looked around for a flower arrangement for Valentine’s Day.  Luckily, I stumbled upon My Glendale Florist.  There is a lot of florist out there but nothing as awesome as My Glendale Florist.  They provided exemplary customer service.  I’ve requested a morning delivery and they were happy to oblige.  I ordered a beautiful flower arrangement from them and the recipient loved it.  Plus, price was unexpectedly very good.  Thank you so much My Glendale Florist – you made me look good to my boss!  They are now definitely my go-to florist.<//Review>

It was by chance that I ordered this bouquet for my daughter who lives in California.  I live in Plymouth, Massachusetts and wanted to send her flowers for her birthday.  I went online and read the reviews for Glendale Florist.  I can tell you that they did not disappoint.  I received an email through the delivery process stating where the flowers were and when they were delivered.  Needless to say...the flowers were beautiful!!  Glendale Florist is my go to in the future.  :)< /text>

Where to begin with this flower shop? I absolutely love these guys. I have come to them before for mothers day, valentines day, birthday flowers, and even my wedding flowers. I love their style. I love there customer service. I trust Rose to come up with a floral arrangement for me anytime I need one. She works with my budget and I always like leaving her an extra tip for her hard work. Oh, I forgot to mention they also deliver to all of Los Angeles? How convenient is that?!?! By far the best flower shop in all of Los Angeles!< /Text>

my Glendale florist did a funeral arrangement for my grandmas funeral. It was beautiful and it was what my grandma would have been happy to have at her funeral. The flower shop was even happy to send me a picture of the arrangement before they sent it to the service. They have to be the best flower shop in Los Angeles with the best flower design. Thank you my Glendale florist! Hopefully next time it's a better occasion.<//text>

<Review>I ordered the Vanda Orchid and Lisianthus Special from Glendale Florist for my fiancée's birthday.

Having them delivered to her work, I was nervous they wouldn't get delivered properly (I didn't have good luck in the past with 1-800-FLOWERS).

They sent me a text when it was out for delivery (saying it'd be delivered in about 23 minutes) and one saying it'd been delivered shortly after my fiancée texted saying how beautiful the flowers were.

I'm glad I found BloomNation and Glendale Florist.  This was a very good experience and has definitely earned me some brownie points!< /Review><username>Nate Andrews< /username><gmapID>0x80c2c0fe64a5ae7f:0x86e5a420033df516< /gmapID>< Response>

I came here for red roses arrangement and they were able to help me out. They offered to deliver them but I wanted to take it myself. Its good to know they also deliver flowers in all of Los Angeles. Their prices are great for the quality and design you get!
They have to be the best flower shop in Glendale! Their design team is innovative and creative. Thank you My Glendale Florist for making my day that much brighter with these flowers!<//review>

<text>I used this flower shop to get flowers delivered to my girlfriend. The entire process was easy and quick. From the moment I ordered the flowers online to the point where my girlfriend thanked me a million times for the flowers. They were even able to deliver the flowers the SAME DAY!  I will most definitely use them for the upcoming Valentine's day and any other occasion that involves flowers. Thank you for the beautiful floral arrangement!</text>< Pics>

Already a late start. The flowers I wanted were out of season, but they had some available at another store, so they got a speedy pick-up and got them for me.

Then, the address I told them to go to was an old, out of date address. Time was getting on and it looked like they were going to have to delay the order a day or two. Damn. BUT NO. They didn't give up. They found the right address on their own and got it delivered anyways. It was a lot further, too.

Not only did they deliver it in time, but they didn't charge me for the extra effort. Also, they ran out of small vases, so they gave me a full size arrangement! Now THAT's uncommon service. My wife got her flowers and all her co-workers were impressed, and the girls were jealous... Ok, so I made up the jealous part, but she got compliments.

Highly recommend these guys.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I order flowers for my wife to get deliver to her work place unfortunately got delivered to billing address and who ever was the person replying to email didn't want to keep his client happy to deliver to right place.
I won't recommend this place based on their customer service.</text>

It was an absolutely amazing floral arrangement ordered last minute and still delivered the day of. They even included a photo of the flowers before they were sent off, which looked even more beautiful than the arrangement pictured online.</Review>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Fast, honest, knowledgeable service! I was on a trip and my glasses broke in half. I needed a new prescription so I figured I would try to have them fixed so I could see my Dr. At home for a new pair. We found Paul gross on Google and decided to give him a try based on his reviews. It was the best decision ever.
He said he could fix them but it would leave a little visible damage but since I needed new glasses anyhow it didn't matter to me. He called us very soon after we left to say he could not weld the frames as he had thought because my frames were titanium, but that he had found a new frame that the lenses fit into and they were ready to pick up. The frames were almost pefectly sized and worked great to finish out our trip. Plus it only cost $27. Overall we were amazed at his ingenuity and pleased with his service.
Give him a try, you will be glad you did.< /Text>< Pics>

I had just broken my last pair of glasses and was finally forced to drive the 25 minutes to give these guys a chance.  Both of my pairs of glasses were pricy (one metal frame and one wire rim).  Both had broken a couple of times before and I had to push my optometrist to repair them, as they were under warranty.  After the second time, she said that she wouldn't repair them again.  After about a year, they had both broken again. I took them to Paul and he fixed both of them, including supplying a new temple piece, in about 30 minutes for about $45.  This place is fantastic!</review>

Wow, there's cheap and cheerful. And then there's affordable and amazing and Paul Gross Eyeglass Repair is both! Very quick repair and Paul is an expert with a delightfully dry sense of humor. Be sure to bring cash, no plastic accepted.</text>

The other reviews here are actually true. He took like 5 minutes or less and charged $5 bucks for fixing a leg that nearly looked bent without repair to me. I even tried him giving him a $5 tip but he refused. I think I'll definitely go to him for all my future eyeglass needs. And the butterscotch candies by the magazines are a plus.<//review>

Just got my eyes repaired after a temple came off my bifocals.  Gotta see.  I will probably get new glasses soon, but I needed something done immediately, and this place was it!  I was told they'll be relocating.  Very happy first customer today.  If I ever need this service again, this is the guy to see.<//review>

One of the nose pads recently came off the wire. I asked businesses around me for help, but they all turned me away without a second glance. They told me I had to buy new eyeglasses, but it takes time and thousands of dollars to order custom glasses. I came across Paul Gross Eyeglass Repair, and Mr. Gross readily agreed to the repair for a mere $32. It was done in just three hours. I am very grateful and extremely satisfied with the repair. The technicality is exceptional, and it looks as good as new.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

Fast, expert service. I had a screw fall out, and got it repaired quickly for a reasonable price. A customer before me had sunglasses repaired, and Mr Gross took the time to point out that because of the frame style, the repair would not hold up in the long term. I appreciate that attention to detail, as did the customer.

A previous reviewer noted that any hobby person could do similar repairs, but it is not that easy to find a hobby person who you know will reliably do the job.< /review>

Drove like 30 minutes but it was all worth it. Thank you Paul Gross for fixing my glasses. Barley when I was about to take out my phone,  "Ready"... my glasses were fixed.  It took him less than 5 min. Great service and  also excellent prices. Highly recommended.</text>

< Review>
While away working I broke not one but three pairs of glasses. I got back home to LA and tried to find a frame repair place. One pair of glasses in particular were damaged (I thought) beyond repair. Paul got to work and in a matter of an half hour he made me the happiest man!!! This is my place now and I highly recommended it to All and any... totally worth the drive !!!<//Review>

<text>I went there because the legs of my glasses were loose. He fixed them but ended up damaging both of the lenses. I got my refund of $5 but I had to pay out of pocket $180 for this stunt. According to him this has only happened 4 times out of 20 years. My advice is please let your customers know this can happen when you are applying heat to their frames. I accepted your apology but that was no way to conduct business and you know this in your heart. I will not come back again as I can’ t afford to loose money on your “No refunds on work done on glasses if something goes wrong” This is not how a business should operate. Best of luck to you all</text>< Rate>

<user_id>111779554318161557537</user_id><text>I brought in 2 pairs of glasses, each with their arms fallen off.  He told me to have a seat, "it shouldn't take long." Sure enough, he was back in less than 5 minutes with both pair good as new.  The charge was $5 total!  This seemed too low so I gave him a 10 and thanked him for the great service.  Fantastic!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

I was a bit skeptical about going to this place didn't know what to expect, was only going based on the reviews and I must say wow completely impressed with his quality/knowledge right of the bat he knew what was wrong with my glasses fixed them in less than 10 minutes and best of all the price! I strongly recommend this shop am glad I found this before going in to get new glasses< /Text>

<date>1516518938589<//date><Rating>3< /Rating><review>It's a part of angeles national forest. Compared to forest in northern California and east coast, there are much less trees. But in southern California, it's still a good choice. In Indian area, there are some big trees, especially pines. Besides, it's a good place to overlook LA downtown and Pasadena downtown. Many people come here to enjoy the sunset.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLJ8kDqup_ZLfoNL1ShuziNHbpcjUw7ou2eDRK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQokHKqSJxtB75HqUuooj1fn-BehcCRrxUJEtY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzbsCCzfNF8NzuGydidCXCzjzVNNP2z20T6epk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4JEjZCHdXO5QMFzuhByN08UJ0TIcb69B5qr2H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>Should be a good place if everything works. But even the restroom is closed and it asked us to use the one in Switzer fall. The parking is only for 15 mins. I don’t really know what the purpose is to have this place... at least, open the restroom ~</review>< Date>

Stopped up here when one of my friends had an oil leak on his motorcycle. The water fountain works luckily, but the office itself is closed Saturday and Sunday. Considering there is no cell service on the mountain, there is a land line at the fire station across the street. One of the few places you can make a call from on the crest. Hung out here for about an hour. Beautiful views.</Text>

This is the information station here at the Highway 2 National Forest entrance. At this location you can purchase Daily access passes as well as annual passes. they also have lots of information about the National Forest, with trails, tours, and guides to help you navigate your way through the forest. They also have schedules and updates pertaining specific locations within the forest that close in summer and winter times. be sure to always stop by here to get the latest information about the forest. Also, it is your responsibility to protect the forest from a fire, so be safe!<//Review>

<Text>It's a great little spot to get info you need. You can also look at a map there and buy parking permits (that are needed to park in Fee Areas of the Forest). Staff is extremely knowledgeable.  Only open on weekends.< /Text><Time>1496586764989< /Time>< Pictures>

It was so fun before I got there I thought is was going to be to much like school but when I first arrived I meet a lot of new people and then we went down to the camp site there were lots of things to play with also we got to go in the dove cage and feed the turkey vulture we had pretty good food to. The hikes were ridding but at the same time we had lots of fun during the hikes the gave us water when it was time to go to sleep we had to change in to our pjs the day before it's time to leave we had a bonfire at the bonfire every group did a skit the last day every one did autograph we also had great time with our conslers and naturalist  this trip was really fun and educational< /review>

One of my favorite spots in LA.  I ride my bike near here a lot and stop for a rest and to fill my water bottle.  The vault toilet has been closed a lot lately due to a bee infestation - there's another one right up the road at the picnic area.< /Text>

If you have questions regarding sites in the Angeles Forest or just general do's and don'ts, this is the place you want to visit.

The park ranger was super funny. I had two buns on my head and she got excited and called me a bear. But besides her charm, she was super informative explaining how we couldn't go out in the forest and fire our legal firearms unless we had hunting permits. Online if you look at the information it appears to suggest you can go out to the forest and practice open firing as long as you are away from campers. But she explained how they aren't a open carry Forest. City folk don't know these things.

Overall great information.<//Text>

Ride up through Angeles Forest all the time. Had a mechanical failure on my motorcycle while on Angeles Forest Highway. Staff let us call AAA for a tow (there is no cellular service up here) and had a set of hex wrenches that we were able to borrow.

Latrine is available on-site.< /text>

Friendly staff.  They seemed to know what they were talking about.  The selection was rather sparse when compared to a company owned store.  Be sure to make an appointment!< /Review>

<review>Priscilla was amazing today with how confusing my situation was! Early in the day I went to a corporate verizon store and they had me in and out of there and I barely even knew what happened. I was switching providers and wanted 2 new phones. The corporate store didn't inform me of any promotions going on. Later on I saw some promotions online so I went into this store. Priscilla helped us out so much! Amazing customer service, and she did everything she could to make sure I could get a second new phone. And I got a new phone! And some acessories! And she walked me through everything!<//review>< pics>

In the past I’ve had some terrible experiences at the store but on my most recent visits, I had two within one week because they didn’t have my phone in stock, I had an excellent experience. A girl name Fara helped me out. She was fun and pleasant and very helpful.< /review>

HORRIBLE! My family and I switched over in August and they had a promotion going on, where we would get $150 gift cards for each line we switched over. We have yet to receive them and I have called 2 times to get this taken care of. Each time they promised to call me back and take care of the issue. Still have not received a call back for either time. Get everything down in writing otherwise they WILL lie to you.</Text>

<review>I did not love this place. Was told a lot of wrong things to get a sale. Was also there 3 hours getting a new phones set up. Returned phones next day after reading all the charges we got charged and not told about. It's sad when younger people take advantage of older citizens.<//review>< pics>

Yea definitely don't go to this location, if you do don't go to Sergio, he doesn't know what he is doing and is rude. Doesn't have patience for older customers and will kick them out if they are curious. I had went to another location before and she knew what she was doing was able to set up my device no issue but this location can't.< /Review>

<text>They never seem to be able to project themself to give you straight answer.  Verizon has best service of any carrier, but you pay for it.  Staff is courteous but not knowledgeable.  They need more more "what if" training.  They need personalization training to meet customers.  Why go there, stand in line,  and get the same vague answers as over the phone.<//text>< gmap_id>

I was very happy with the information and the advice the staff gave. At the end of the day they made a sale honestly but, I believe it was in my best interest. I wish I didn't have to pay for fees and taxes but, that's verizon not these guys. I was given lots of deals and coupons. Really cool staff.<//Review>

<text>INFORM YOUR OLDER RELATIVES ABOUT THIS STORE, THE KIDS HERE ARE NON OTHER THAN THIEVES!! ACCEPT FOR CRUZ. Leah, was under the impression I was an easy target to SCAM, BUT SHE WAS WRONG! She attempted over and over and over to get me to believe that I COULD NOT RETURN AN $899 PHONE BASED ON A VERBAL STATEMENT SHE CONSTRUCTED. SHE WASNT AWARE THAT I HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE 14 DAY RETURN  POLICY.

There was another older woman at the store attempting to sort out the same problem, unfortunately  they got her good! I spoke with her outside and according  to her, she was stuck  with a phone payment and a phone until 2021! They had SOMEHOW  NOT INFORMED HER OF THE 14 DAY RETURN POLICY!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Excellent  service  representative and treatment of me as if I was a valued customerjust for a phone replacement. And I walked out with aTablet also that I was not expected on getting.  The experience was the best I've ever had.  I thought it was my Birthday, Christmas and Anniversary all in one Day. This Young Mans Service was Excellent. Manager Material if I've  Ever Seen. All for $40 now and $40 on my bill.  Lord,  Blessed me with Verizon. Thank You. Sincerely,

< Review>
I came in today at 2pm to upgrade my 8+ to the xs plus. There was a glitch in the system which was causing issues trying to let the phone be turned in. Daniel Davis reached out to multiple managers going through prompt after prompt getting nowhere. I told him don’t worry I can come another day, he was persistent and said he would take care of it for me. During this time he was also helping other people in the store. He finally got mine squared away, and three other people as well and everybody left with smiles and were satisfied. Highly recommend going to see Daniel it was a pleasure and he really worked hard for me.</Review>

< Review>
When we didn't want to purchase a new phone their whole demeanor changed and it became an unpleasant experience.  There's a better verizon store right down the street.

1)They said we'll keep your bill the same and get u out with a new phone but they didn't mention it was changing my plan to something that only had 600kb of hotspot compared to my 15gb.
We rejected the plan change and new phone, all we needed was a new sim card.
2) they wanted 10$ for a new sim card and 20$ for activation but at the other main st verizon wireless the sim card is free and it activates itself.< /Review>

<text>I cannot believe the negative reviews. Most of them seem to be disgruntled people in general. My experience with Alex and his team has been great. He replaced a motor for me in my 2012 Toyota Prius, and the change went smoothly, for a very reasonable cost, considering the work being done. The engine has a 6 month warranty on it, and at the 3 month mark it start knocking in the motor. I took it back, fearing the worst. After all I had a used motor put in the car, and that carries some risk with it naturally. Alex's team looked at it and determined it was the lifters knocking. They saw the car was throwing a code for a bad sensor. They changed that sensor, replaced the oil, and the knocking went away. I still have 3 months left on the engine warranty too. They were fair about the cost for this and I am very happy with their service. Highly recommended.

The only knock I have is both times I have taken my car in I noticed grease on the door handle and center console where your arm would rest while driving the car. I cleaned this off as it isn't that big a deal and not enough to knock off a star, but would be nice to have the grease cleaned off or have the mechanics wear gloves in the car. Also, they are very very busy so there can sometimes be a wait, but that just shows they know their stuff and they are in demand.< /text>< Resp>

I brought in my engine for my prelude and it took a bit because of the holidays, but Alex really walks you through the process and writes down what will be done on the receipt. I was able to come mid rebuild and see the process on the engine. Overall great work and haven’t had any issues with the work done.</text>

<Text>absolutely terrible owner and business ethics. I had my axle rebuilt here in June of 2020 and it had a 1 year warranty on it. fast forward to december and I needed it rebuilt again, the owner is not pleasant at all. he was extremely rude and exploitful. he was so reluctant to rebuild my axle under warranty, but I tried with him anyways. this where it gets sleezy. he "rebuilt" my axle in 20 minutes, upon getting home and installing it, my car still made the same noise it had previously made. upon further inspection he forgot to put GREASE in the axle itself. he want as far as just replacing the torn boot but he didn't put the grease in it. I had to tear the boot off just to find no grease in the boot. just wow. I have never seen such sleezy ethics anywhere else. guessing he didn't expect me to tear into and just replace the grease myself. stay very very far away from this guy, not too mention the owner is a egomaniac-know it all-short temper kind of guy.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>P & G is a great place to take your classic car to have work done on it. Alex the owner is super friendly and really knows his classic cars. He and his crew rebuilt my motor for my 66 Mustang. He works on ALL types of classics as well. He really knows his Chevys, but he knows his Fords too. Matter of fact last time I was there he had more Mustangs in his bays than any other car. He also does body work/paint and upholstery for your classics.< /Text>< gmapID>

Came in to get my transmission serviced and couldn’t be more satisfied. Alex and Don helped me out big time. Don made many calls to get the correct filter and the guys put it on no problem. Don’t pay too much attention to the bad reviews. These guys are diligent and know what they’re doing. Thanks again Mr. Alex</Text>

A bit expensive, but honest and highly efficient.   I thought I needed a new motor, Alex did a diagnostic of the car and told me "your engine is fine" all you need is a new timing chain and assembly". So instead of forking out around $3000 I paid around $1400 and my car runs great.  Unlike some places P & G was always easy to work with and had my car ready in the time promised. They take pride in their work. This will be my go to place for now on.</text>

I don't trust anybody with my family's safety except Alex and his mechanics. Thank you Alex for everything you do for my family and I.</review>

<Review>These guys are rip offs had my daughter call for a quote. On used engine quoted her $3000 when they cost no more. Than 900  , stay away. From this shop if you are a female ! By the way Mr manager   I'm in the same business just thought it would be convenient for my daughter what a waste of time. , and she is having her engine done for $1500 which is a fair price considering where she.

Took 2 Heads to get resurfaced, they did a cheap job because they used a Belt Sander. Was not flat. There was rigid deep scratches on my head which ended up leaking alot of coolant!
Took the heads to another shop to get it done CORRECTLY.

Lost over $300 taking my heads here.< /text>

P&g is a place to avoid. Alex the owner will tell you he is an honest man, a honest business man. He's not!
He will tell their knowledge is superior to other shops. It isn't!
He will tell you their work is top notch. Again no it isn't
And his mechanics? They're not!
As I write this my p&g " rebuilt " motor they rebuilt and installed in my 90 4 runner is back at their shop for the maybe tentI time, I'm not sure. But I do know it been way too many times. Anyway I took it in on 5/10/18 (Did I mention this started back in january) because the trouble code indicating the knock sensor keeps lighting up the check engine light, has been ever since I got it back after the rebuild. Alex said" no way " it could be the knock
Sensor because they already replaced it twice. So I took it home and did their work tracking down the problem, often stopping to marvel at the unprofessional and shoddy work p&g puts out. But back to the present, took vehicle in on the 10th  for warranty work. Yesterday afternoon (the 15th )  my vehicle is parked outside in their lot, hidden from view (unless you use the metro link parking lot) where it has sat since I left it with Alex with him promising to go over it with a fine tooth comb and give me a vehicle I can drive. Well he probably not going to be happy about this review but he's taking my money won't fix my car what else can he do. Like I said at the beginning P&G is a place to avoid they got my money don't let him get yours oh and by the way I'm not sure what Alex's definition of honesty but it's not the same as mine<//Review>

I give Alex's crew a big thumbs down on the "rebuilt" he did for my Honda Civic. After said and done I am left with a motor that was supposedlly rebuilt. Seems to me like they just swapped out my motor with one of his used junk Japanesse motors. To top it off working parts were exhanged off my original motor and replaced with faulty parts, one example: my distributor. I took in my car to another shop to test the compression and sure enough two of the cylinders have weak compression. My Honda was taken to back to him at least five times throughout my warranty period. A few times for the clutch, oil leaks, overheating etc. First it was the V-Tech solenoid that was not working. The first day I took it from the shop. Then the clutch which I paid for a new one with the swap. After he fixes I get charged for a flywheel (used) because they didn't have the integrity to tell it was bad. See most places will resurface it or at the very least recommend a new or include it with the clutch. Now to the oil leaks. What a mess! My distributor leaked oil, the valve cover gasket also leaked oil and was replaced after he did the swap. The gasket was used not even done right. They installed a used one. I also had oil leaking from my oil pan gasket because the drain valve would keep turning. We took it in for him to check and we go back to pick up the car after a week. Alex says its done going off his mechanic. So we had him keep the car on the lift to show us he fixed it. Sure enough the plug kept spinning! My car was in the shop for about week just for this. I could of done a lot of this on my own but thats what I paid the shop for. He would try telling me "Oh were not going to charge you for that!" What you mean? I asked him once. "I paid you over two grand by now for this rebuild that was not done right. He responds " I have customers who pay my $8,000 for their car to get worked on." Ok so apparentlly you have to spend at least eight grand to get good service here. Oh yeah another thing, Alex and I agreed on a final price after I gave him half the money to start the job. When I go to pay the balance his daughter charges me more than what we agreed on. I didnt want to agrue with her so I left it at that. It's not the money its the point. One of the last times I took it to him I made sure to test drive it on the freeway and back to the shop. Sure enought Im pulling in and the car starts to overheat. You had a long life client but after this poor serivce you provided never again. Get some real mechanics in there Alex. I understand your business is growing but keep up with it. Im not going to say I hated it because hate is a strong word but I am sure not happy with his work his sorry mechanics did on my car.</review>

I was recommended this place by friends brother-in-law as a shop that does excellent work at a good price. I took my 86 4runner to P&G Auto for an engine swap (22rec). Please make no mistake, Alex and everyone who works there was very polite and awesome. There is a starting point to consider as well in this review and that is that this motor ran even with a cracked block, I started to remove the valve covers and discovered the crack, at that point took it to P&G. Alex quoted me with an extremely fair price of $1400 with a $700 deposit to start work. After 2 weeks or less I got the call that it would be ready. I took the day off work, and got a ride to Rialto. Waited approx 4 hours and then Alex informed me that it wouldn't be ready that day. No problem, a few more days go by and I get the call that it will be done and ready to pick-up Thursday. Take the day off work, get a ride to Rialto, watched in the shop (I was told it was an open shop and customers may watch) as two different mechanics try to assemble the EFI to the head. First one declared it good as the motor started and I pointed out to him that a considerable amount of gas was leaking out of the bottom of the fuel rail assembly. This repeated twice as the O-rings kept getting pinched from incorrect installation. I was then asked to go wait back upfront because the mechanic was nervous with me watching over his shoulder. Totally understandable, I can be the same way at my job. After 2 more hours, they come upfront and tell me that it won't be ready that day either. I get a call the next week and Alex said they got it running and took it for a test drive and the brakes are bad and the wheel cylinders,master cylinder, and calipers need to be replaced. Ok too the first two, I'll wait on the calipers. Then the fuel pump and alternator were bad. Ok replace those after all they are prob over 20 years old no problem. Get the third call that it will be ready. Leave work early, get a ride to Rialto. Fuel pump STAR AUTO PARTS delivered was a dud. No worries guy is on his way with a new one, no charge, and heres a free star auto parts sweater. Ok I love free stuff. 2 hours and the fuel pump is in, test drive and the idle is a little out of wack, no worries, adjusted the idle and took the truck home. So with understanding to it being an old truck, and more things went wrong than were known the $1400 estimate went to $2750. Ouch but I was glad to have the truck back, I love my Yota. Less than a week out the fuel pump fails on the freeway. P&G brought a tow truck and grabbed me off the 210, much appreciated no cost to me.
This was a year ago and this is where its at now. 2 of the four injectors installed turned out to be used (not rebuilt cores, used). Many of the parts installed on the motor were used and rusted, painted over with black paint which has now peeled. The motor was assembled without the throttle position sensor, the new radiator sprung a leak, alternator will be replaced shortly since when I turn on the headlights the idle drops and the motor sputters. Replacing the fuel pump on principle alone (never buy star auto parts pumps), I just went to replace the header and only two stock studs were there (supposed to be all studs), the rest were bolts, 2 of the bolts were stripped and now I have to re-tap the head.
So is the motor running? barely but it is running. Is P&G all to blame? Absolutely not, some of the sensors and what not could have been damaged when I took it in. However, at the end of the day this is what I take inventory on; I lost 2 days of pay (about $300 wages before taxes) not counting the 1/2 day to pick it up when it was finally ready and asking for rides from work in orange county to Rialto. I have a stripped head bolts, used parts, and a motor that still does not run correct. All for a total cost of about $3000 including time lost, not including personal headache and zero confidence in the motors assembly.< /Review>

Accommodating Dealership, Sales Manager was helpful,
a definite plus. Experience was on par with other
prior purchases from different Dealerships. As a
suggestion we think Bentley should furnish
better license plate frames rather then the
inexpensive plastic ones- that definitely was a
misstep. We felt the Sales person should have spent more time on explaining the vehicle when delivered. He was more then willing to program the seat settings & garage opener & departed
after that.< /Text>

<text>After being a multiple Mercedes Benz owner for many years I can only say after now having my 1st Bentley that the customer service at this establishment does not hold a candle to Mercedes Benz customer service. Its really a shame being that the car is a beautiful but as far as customer service this dealership gets my lowest rating...No return calls ever & after its 1st service when picking up the dash still displayed "Service Now"  the Service Mgr then told me to bring it back another time & that would be removed, are you kidding me???< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We bought a pre-owned Bentley from Kyle Racine and it was a PERFECT experience! He and Rancho Mirage did everything they said they would do, when they said they'd do it-it's been a fantastic experience! The car arrived in perfect condition and we're loving it! We bought the car based on Kyle's word without test- driving it and he absolutely represented the car as it was-in terrific condition! We confidently recommend Rancho Mirage Bentley and Kyle Racine!< /review>

Extremely positive experience with Kyle and Eleona, great customer service, they take time to explain everything  you need to know about the vehicle and the paperwork that go with it. They are very knowledgeable and respectfull of your needs and wishes.
These two make a great team at the company, top experience for both of them, they follow up on their client,  very courteous  , biying a car at Indigo palm desert is fun thanks to them!!!<//text>

Cute little park. It was nice and clean and the people that were running around were all friendly. The only thing was that there were a bunch of wasps around the play area. They didn't harass us but they were present.<//Text>

I'm using this small and cute park since 2013 to train soccer to my son. Grasses are keeping short enough to play soccer. Also have some shelters that makes it great for birthday party.</text>

<text>Nice quiet park. Great place to go have a picnic because it never gets too crowded or loud. Kind of hidden next to a school, but that's part of it's allure.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Good park that has tons of space to run and play for the little ones. Very quiet. Not the best at night due to limited lighting, but the neighborhood is good so if you're in a big enough group you should be fine. The city takes.csre of the appearance, and yes, it has a pokestop for Pokemon Go players, and a gym. ;)<//Text>

Better for older children not so much for younger toddlers. But lots of field to run around and sit. Not much shade.< /Text>

so normally I love deli delicious.. but when. you order fries that where rewarmed up and the box looks like its half the fries in there for days.. no thanks. Can't understand them when they are talking. Skipping on the meat.. as much as we paid i could of gotten better food..<//Review>

Very pricey for lunch, the sandwiches are made to perfection. Employees were chit-chating and only worried about to go orders waited a long time, feel bad for all the people that come in during the lunch hour. Fries were not fresh and had no seasoning.< /review>

<Review>I went in for dinner. There was a young man and a middle aged woman working. I’m assuming he was new which is totally fine, he’s still learning but the woman was beyond rude. I have no idea what she is doing there. As soon as we walked in she asked “what kind of bread” we weren’t ready to order yet. 2 min later “what kind of bread” as if she was rushing us to order. After the young man took our order she started telling him things about the way he took the order in front of us. She was complaining and complaining to him with attitude. You don’t do that, much less in front of customers. Another man walked in and the same thing about the bread. He literally took two steps in and “what kind of bread” SO RUDE! That customer ended up walking out after the 3rd time she asked what bread. She needs to be fired or trained again. That is not how you work customer service or treat your employees. Won’t be going back.< /Review></record>

I went to get a sandwich in a hurry.  They were quick and delivered it to my table with a sweet smile.  It is a clean well run sandwich shop that creates delicious sandwiches.  I hate the parking but love the place enough to go there anyway.  The parking is not their fault.< /Text>

<Review>This was the second time I have gone in this restaurant (Clovis/Herndon) and been totally disappointed. I use to go in there at least 1-2 week but last couple times have been really disappointing. The bread was hard, sandwich was really skimpy, and chicken was very dry. Anyways just thought I would put my review and hope that maybe it gets better!! Thanks!!< /Review>< UserId.>

< review>
I've normally had a great experience at this location. However today, I believe it was the manager who was in (I don't believe she's been in when I've been before) and she was not very accomodating. My kids wanted the same sandwich so I decided to get a Medium and give them each half. They wanted cheddar on one side, Jack on the other. No biggie, I thought. But the manager refused to do it. She said, "I see what you're trying to do. But you'll need to get two minis to have two different cheeses" (since I was being so sneaky trying to buy one big sandwich for my kids to share, instead of two minis?) She tried to explain to me why "it won't work" but I didn't understand. She looked at me with eyes big and eye brows high and said, "Huh? Do you understand?" Well, I didn't. She further explained that the cheeses melt and it wouldn't work. ???? She decided for me that I wouldn't want two different cheese on a sandwich that might melt together. I didn't push back because I couldn't see this going any better. The environment felt "cold" and unkind... she wasn't even friendly about her refusal. I left feeling like she thought I was stupid (which she was happy to expose publicly). Even my 11 and 9 year olds mentioned how rudely I'd been treated after we'd left.

As I said at the start, I've normally had a great experience here. I've only been a handful of times, but we LOVE Deli Delicious. Unfortunately, I may avoid this one because of the poor customer service when the management is in. (Otherwise I've had REALLY great experience with the staff in the past!)<//review>

They never have Dutch Crunch Bread when I asked why they said it’s not an order day. I have gone in as early as 10am and still no Dutch Crunch and they are rude and they don’t wear hair nets when they are preparing food and they heat the food up out of the microwave to speed up the process and not use the toaster oven. Horrible service and food prep methods.< /text>

Great sandwiches, love how right after you get your order on a cold sandwich everything inside the sandwich is cold but the bread is a little warm and toasted.  Their beer battered fries are the best.<//review>

<review>Absolutely disgusting dining area. Employees chatting it up not working or cleaning the biohazard site which was the dining area, which makes sense from what we saw next while waiting for our sandwiches... Food handlers wiping their noses with the plastic gloves they're wearing while prepping sandwiches, as well as  coughing without covering... My father and I was so disgusted by what we saw we lost our appetites and left before food was served... Oh yeah, went to wash hands in the men's room after placing our order. Men's room was equally as filthy as the dining area and had no paper towels.  I love Deli Delicious but absolutely DO NOT dine at this particular location unless you want to be the victim of some exotic flesh eating food poisoning bacteria.<//review></record>

The sandwiches were subpar, they took forever, and the employees seemed stuck up and unfriendly and the only reason it's not one star is I was super hungry and this place satiated me.<//Review>

Best sandwiches in town, just VERY expensive. It also takes a long time for orders to come through. DON'T GO DURING LUNCH TIME HOURS! You'll be waiting at least 30 minutes<//Review>

<Review>Went here today and ordered a number 21 which comes with Turkey, avocado, cream cheese and sprouts. When I received my sandwich i first noticed that there weren't sprouts so I went up and asked for them. I sat back down and took a few bites and noticed they forgot the avocado so I asked the worker for avocado on the side. When I got my avocado there was a lot of lettuce in it.<//Review><user_id>110268213616698822310<//user_id>< username>

The best place to go for New Wave music, apparel and a whole lot more. Posters to Pins to Car Window Decals and many collectibles. Ask for Ray, he's the guru of Kaos Records in Covina.<//text>

I’ve been here three times (Plan to go a couple more times) and each time, I was welcomed. It’s a great place. I took my best friend here in 2019 and she got a couple items. I can’t wait to be back.<//Review>

<text>This place is nice. A lot of records and band shirts. You need to go in with the state of mind that you will be sorting through records which is nice. You can go in and trade records. They offer new and used records. When I went the girl working the counter was VERY sweet and helpful. Definitely coming back.</text>< gmapID>

Amazing place! Good selection of psychobilly, punk, and new wave. Love the stickers, and patches. Also the 2 for $1 pins are to die for!
And this is a great place to see flyers for up coming shows. My favorite place!< /Text>

A truly unique and epicly (epically?) awesome record store! They have a wide selection of all the stuff you want that's HARD TO FIND. I'm glad I live local to this one... perfect place for all your oldschool music needs!

Also, I'd like to add details of an actual experience. I was to see Depeche Mode in May 2018. I really wanted the Violator hoodie to go with me, but... they didn't have my size. BUT, They ordered it for me and it was ready for pickup just minutes before I arrived to check on that! Also got some Decals for the car. Overall, 100☆s this place rocks!<//Text>

Great place to find records, band shirts, posters, patches, pins and other neat stuff, the Kaos crew are some of the coolest people you'll meet.<//review>

Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas was highly recommended by family.  Ultimately, what brought us there was the price of the car.  What got us to purchase was the people.  Jeremy Israel-Tombs was knowledgeable and friendly.  He answered our questions, discussed options and gave us space to make our own choices.  Not once did we feel any pressure to purchase or choose one selection versus another.  Later Sang Lee worked with us and found the best finance deal.  We live in Santa Clarita that has its own Mercedes dealership.  However, the experience here was worth the drive and when I'm ready to service the GLC 300 or purchase a new Mercedes Benz for myself, I'll be heading over to Calabasas.  It turned out to not just be about the buy but the people that we encountered.  Thanks again to everyone at Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas.</Text>

Best Mercedes-Benz dealership! Speak to David Koeppel if you are interested in buying or leasing here. He is very helpful and informative. This place truly has the full Mercedes-Benz service. I highly recommend stopping here if your ever in the market.<//review>

If your looking to purchase a new Mercedes Benz you need to go and see John Nazarian. Awesome customer service and Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is one of the most professional reputable that exist.  This is my 8th car purchase from them. Just simply Awesome Professional People that care and will do what it takes to make you happy.

Thank You All<//Review>

I have been buying Mercedes for 20 years now but the experience I had in Mercedes of Calabasas was outstanding, 1.sunil and Tracy both went out of the way to find the car configuration that I wanted. 2. The delivery was so smooth and organized, even before I reached the dealership . I would strongly recommend these people to everyone.<//review>

Very easy and convenient car buying experience.  I felt very well taken care of by Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas.  I called and spoke with John who was able to answer my questions and help me choose the right car for me.  Everything was handled without me having to go into the dealership, then the car was delivered to my home.  I really liked this way of buying a car and will definitely do it this way from here on out.< /Review>

Hands down the best Mercedes dealership I have worked with in all the years of being a Mercedes customer. General manager Niko and Tracy in sales took such amazing care of me and worked so hard to make sure I was completely satisfied. They went above and beyond to get me out of my previous situation and put me in a brand new 2021 C300 Mercedes. Having gone so far over my miles in my previous lease I didn’t think it was even possible but after going to other dealerships in the area Calabasas was the only one that could find a solution for me.
I am so happy with my purchase. The staff is professional, great energy and pleasant to be around. Thank you so much Mercedes of Calabasas:)< /Text>

Devin was outstanding! Was down the street looking at BMW's and was really disappointed with the sales staff there. Nobody would even pay attention to me. When I got to Mercedes Devin instantly greeted me and was super friendly and knowledgable. Will definitely return once my current lease is up.</Review>

He listened to my concerns, answered my questions and delivered as promised. He went above and beyond in all aspects and kept my best interest in mind!

Great service ! My guy Michael Linggadjaja help me with the buying process. Great guy, very knowledgeable and best of all friendly. Most people bring their guard up when going to buy a car because they believe that all the sales people are sharks and trying to get them to pay. That was not the way i felt with Michael, i would truly recommend going to him for your buying car needs. This is especially if you want to have a smooth and easy buying experience with no pressure. He allowed us to test drive the car alone due to covid restrictions, educated us on the car and made recommendations based on the options we wanted.

Would definitely buy another car from Michael!

Might have to go back this weekend for the custom C300 Coupe they have !< /Review>

Part two of my experience with Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. I recently traded in my Mercedes which I purchased at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas for a 2021 Mercedes which I purchase at the dealership in Ontario. That's a whole other story involving Calabasas. I had extended warranties that I needed to cancel. I contacted the finance dept in Calabasas they sent me the paper work needed to be completed. I filled out my portion of the form and emailed it back to them. This took place February 26, 2021. I was told it could take 2 months to process which I found strange but couldn't get a reason why it took so long. On April 9th I emailed the finance dept. to get a update on my request. and got no response. On 4/14 I called was put through to someone in finance left a message never got a call back. On 4/15 I called again left a message got no response. To say the least my experience with Mercedes Benz of Calabasas has not been a good one. There is a story why I didn't get my new Mercedes from Calabasas as well. Maybe I will make that part three.<//Review>

This was the easiest experience I’ve had getting into a new car. Jeremy is an absolute gem, answered all my questions, and gave me immense peace of mind when making the decision to get into a new car. He’s the best, seriously! With additional help from Raja and Tracy, my experience at Mercedes of Calabasas was exceptional. I felt comfortable, did not feel pressured or haggled, and I’m in LOVE with my new car. 10 out of 5 stars!< /Review>

< review>
Michael Linggadjaja rocks here! I had the pleasure of meeting him the other day at the Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas. I asked him 21 different questions about the particular car I was looking for. He wowed me, with a bunch of things I never knew about Mercedes-Benz. Know I know why, after speaking with him, why everybody wants one. I really appreciate him answering all my questions, being kind and most importantly, HONEST. I’ve bought countless cars and put him to the test. He passed with flying colors and he will always be my go to man to purchase a Mercedes-Benz from! This guy rocks! When in doubt, always ask to speak with Michael Linggadjaja. He will set you up and meet all your expectations! This guy is really a ROCKSTAR! These are the type of employees that you must keep and reward! He is a great guy! Keep up the awesome work Michael! YOU ROCK!</review>

My mother and I came here to check out a car that we were really interested in. The sales lady who helped us honestly could've done a better job she treated us like window shoppers and wasn't giving us actual numbers we were looking for and also wasn't give us the attention we needed. I wanted to test drive the vehicle prior to getting into talking numbers unfortunately the sales lady mannerisms didn't allow for that to happen. This experience occurred on 12/21/2020.</Text>

I recently purchased a new CLA from John N at Mercedes in Calabasas. It was such a great experience from the moment I walked into the door until I sat in the office to sign. John was so helpful and informative. He wasn't pushy like you typically sales person. He was super knowledgeable too. John was able to get me a great price for my current car and found me the perfect CLA. I love it! Anyone looking for a great deal and wonderful experience, def ask for John.</Review>

Ask for Roman, he is amazing!!! He is extremely knowledgeable and great energy! Roman made it a priority to make sure we were happy with our purchase. This dealership is no hassle, no pressure and we appreciated that. They take great measures to sanitize, social distance during these challenging times. We highly recommend and refer Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas!<//review>

I was so lucky to get connected straight to Devin from sales department. Please be sure to ask for this professional member of the team. Devin made a whole lease renewal process so easy, smooth and pleasant - it was less than 24 hours from starting our conversation about my lease renewal to me getting out of my garage to get a new car (my new 2021 Mercedes was delivered straight to my place!!) - you know how it is important now, during pandemic, to be able to sign all paperwork and get a new car without going to dealership. Also, I got a great deal for my new car - thanks to Devin!

By the way, I contacted several Mercedes dealership before contacting Calabasas (Encino, Van Nuys) - people on the phone there were so uninterested talking to me, finding me a deal, responding to my questions, no one ever followed-up.  So, upon calling to Calabasas dealership - I did not expect I ever end up finding someone caring and attentive to all the details, like Devin! He found me a great deal for a new car, delivered my new car to my place, took back my old car and he is always there for me to answer my questions - and believe me I have lots of them! Thank you for your patience, Devin, and all your help - you are THE BEST!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Bad sale representative and services.  Up to now I haven't received my 2nd key fob, the manual book to operate the car, back seat floor kats for my suv.  They told me they will ship them out.  But the following weekend I went to them.  They said they will ship them out.  They said to call the on the next Monday to remind but they never responded back.  This is the worse dealership ever.  Update my review from one star to three stars.  After two weeks they finally ship the floor mats, key fob and the manual book to my house.  I really appreciate the sale manger to get this done in a timely manner.  I'll come back to this place in the future for my car service.<//Text>

<Review>Outstanding service on so many levels.
From beginning to end everyone I interacted with at Service department of Mercedes-Benz Calabasas was so knowledgeable about my concerns and questions.
My Advisor Kyle Wiens was so helpful and so extremely helpful in making sure I received all the latest informations regarding the repairs status on my car and made sure to go the extra mile in so many ways, I highly recommend him and the Calabasas Mercedes-Benz dealership and service department.
I still have a few extra things to be done to my car but couldn’t see myself spending a fortune on fixing it all right now.
I will go definitely go back in the near future.
Cheers!</Review>< pics>

<pics>None</pics><review>A terrible experience!   "Buyer beware!"

Purchased a car and did not get the second car key.  Got a runaround from a sales manager, who finally promised to take care of it, and didn't.  That manager left the agency.

Telephone calls and emails to Michael Franz, the overall General Manager of the Calabasas agency,  produced no results.  At one point, the agency asked if I had any paperwork stating that I was entitled to a 2nd key (as though they never knew that the purchase of a Mercedes  included two keys.)

Even contacted the Regional Mercedes headquarters twice for assistance,  and they also couldn't get the Calabasas agency to even return my phone calls or emails.

Then located and contacted the North Carolina parent corporation which owns "Mercedes of Calabasas"  (just a fictitious business name in California) but still got no results.

Finally, had to go to the trouble of filing a lawsuit against both the  No. Carolina parent corporation and its fictitious business name  entity of "Mercedes of Calabasas."

The suit remained pending several months awaiting a trial, when the local General Manager, Michael Franz,  finally emailed and promised the missing key.  I accepted a settlement offer, which jncluded reimbursing me for court costs of $200 in addition to the second key.  This was back in June 2020.

A key was finally delivered to my home.  It would not work in the car.  (Apparently this Mercedes dealership had never before made a duplicate key for one of its cars.   At that point, the agency finally told me that they would need the  physical presence of my car in order  to produce a duplicate key.  I had to give up use of my car for a day;  the agency picked up my car and finally  produced a key that worked.

The Agency claimed it could only pay the $200 court costs out of its corporate offices in No. Carolina.  As of today,  September 1, 2020, those court costs remain due but unpaid.< /review>< userid>

<text>They are the most difficult to work with MB dealership I have ever experienced. Perhaps they are short handed. For example, call and ask for somebody by name. You will be directed to their phone. You leave a message. Hours later you call back & same happens. Then you talk to another person and find out the first one was not in that day!  Why doesn't the person answering the phone tell you that!  Upper management needs to review the level of customer service and improve their game if they want to operate a premium/luxury automobile purchase experience.
BTW, the individual employees are very good but they are hampered, I believe, by the structure they work in.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><gmapID>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The team over at Mercedes of Calabasas gets 5 stars hands down!   They understand what rolling out the red carpet really  means.  They take care of you from beginning to end.  I highly recommend adding the service package to your purchase/lease.  It makes it all feel care free as far as maintaining this beautiful machine.  If  you want agreat experience with a car dealer, pick Merc Benz of Calabasas.  Niko in sales Is spectacular.  He knows just how to take care of you on the front of the deal, then Jason the service manager makes sure the great service continues throughout the length of the lease.   These gentleman went over and above.  The best last is they simply act and treat you like real people,  they listen and work to be helpful.  They are finding a way to put the fun back into the car experience.  Thank you gentleman.  I would highly recommend the dealership!</Review>

Absolutely loved my purchase experience at the Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas! John was super helpful, professional, personable, made me feel super comfortable answering all of my questions and filling in blanks where needed in order to make the best decision. Even sending me photos of my now new car so then I could make a final decision.

<review>I’ve been looking to get a GLC for a while and my friend recommended I look on sonic automotive because they have amazing pricing and after checking the website turns out he is right. After doing the research I ended up looking at Mercedes-Benz of calabasas inventory so I decided to head over there on Wednesday 1/20 ready to buy. I was about to walk in when I noticed a blond lady with NO MASK walking around inside the dealership! No thank you, I am not going to risk my own and my family life to get a GLC. Unacceptable behavior especially from a Mercedes benz representative, the dealership looked dead inside. Corporate need to have some serious talk with that lady. I ended up going to WI simons in Santa Monica turns out it’s a sonic dealership as well so very aggressive pricing and excellent customer service.</review>< Pics>

<review>Jason McCann in service and the technicians are great. They work quickly and efficiently. Communication was top notch and I really like being able to pay before I get there to pick up my car. I was well taken care of and was pleased with all the measures they took to ensure not only that I was safe during the pandemic and having to take my car in, but also how they were making sure the employees were safe as well. Loaner was clean and I was in and out quickly and efficiently. My car runs better than ever and the diagnosis was spot on. They get it right the first time, every-time. What more could you ask for?<//review><gmapID>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2</gmapID><rating>5</rating>< Name>

I was so happy with my lease from Mercedes of Calabasas because the staff were just amazing! Mori went above and beyond to make sure I got the exact car I wanted at the best price. Her manager David was also friendly and helpful. The receptionist also made us feel welcome while we were waiting for Mori. Overall, from receptionist to manager, I had a wonderful experience with them and I’m loving my new car!< /Text>

<Review>It is very easy to schedule an appointment at the MB Calabasas Service center. Jason Grijalva is very customer friendly. MB provided a loaner vehicle while my car was being serviced. Jason called me for a followup concerning some question.</Review>< pics>

I had a wonderful experience from start to finish here. My old car was on its last leg and I found an incredible deal for a used car that I couldn’t pass up. Tracy was a delight to work with and didn’t play the usual car salesperson gimmicks that make buying a car so annoying. She was straightforward and extremely personable. They are taking great care of their customers during the pandemic by providing masks and gloves for everyone and did a full disinfecting clean of the new car before my test drive and once again before I took it home. This is a great dealership, and I couldn’t be happier with my new car. Thank you!!!<//text>

%100 disaster please stay away from Mercedes as my Experience from my S550 has been awful. I have 2017 S550e. My kids they do not like to get a ride inside of my car because of their bad Experience and they have safer feeling with my wife’s car which is a cheaper 3 series BMW . From the beginning of my lease i have had lots of issues and i still have them . Let me get started with The transmission which does automatic downshift by itself and it has happened couple of time on freeways with higher speeds and on street . It Seems like your suddenly pushing the break pedal and the roar of the engine is coming inside and scaring you and other passengers like my kids . I report this incident a couple of times to this dealers , W.I.simonson , calabasas and Encino mercedes benz branches of Los Angeles area and they say let’s go on a test drive and show us what the issue is .how can I show them if this happens approximately one time per month the last time in Encino branch the person who test my car was Mr Charles and during the ride he told me we have to keep your car for a couple of days and I complained about how i pay approximately $1,500 monthly to Mercedes and I even did pay $10,000 down payment to get my payment lowered and I drive really normal. He then denied to keep the car and told me seems like you don’t like the car and the car doesn’t show any problem and he talked about this to my service advisor Mr kevin Malone and they refuse any claim towards my car . It was about safety and let me explain about lots more issues . The sound system is good brand but the car does not match with iPhone 10 . I took my cars couple of times and I explained to them how I cannot connect my phone to the car ( not with Bluetooth and not with wire car's speakers will not connect to any app like Facebook videos even your gallery video's but sometimes is working with Youtube and sometimes not ) and they told me go to Apple Store and Which I did . Apple store then told me that this is a Mercedes problem and I believe them, because I had a 2013 E Class Mercedes and I never had any issues with that needless to say when they give you a loaner car all those cars work perfectly even though they are the less expensive models such as C class or GLA but they connect to my phone perfectly and I explain it to them and the Encino , Calabasa and W.I.Simonson branches told me they are not able to do anything about it because the car has an older system(my car is 2017) I told them that I never had any problems with the system of my old E class which was a 2013 Mercedes but they still refused it also Calabasas dealer bring one 2018 S class and they tried but it had the same issue as my car . The back up camera has issue and sometimes it showing your monitor half black and the other half is an unknown place. Sit belt of the passenger locked one time and my son was stuck in the seat and after turning the car off and on 2 times the car released the seatbelt . The first month of my lease I got 2 flat tires and when I get to tire shop ( because I didn’t buy the tire protection plan ) The person showed me the tire and from the inside they were ripped and there was a big tear from inside the tire but outside had no damage or scratch . I definitely will not buy a 3rd Mercedes and I am considering to buy better quality car like a Tesla and not a car that's just popular for the name of its brand such as Mercedes with horrible quality ,and offensive customer service and waste of peoples money. I have all the issues documented by photo and video and witnesses and I love to show to who ever that would like to know. I am right and here is my car information for you to know that i’m not from another car companies.</Text>

I love my car and it took me some time to find it.  Nori was helpful in this very long day.  I recommend bringing your own hand sanitizer, coffee, water, snacks etc.  You won't be offered anything.  I did however leave with a great car that I absolutely love.  MBZ Calabasas definitely has the greatest choice of cars and you are bound to find the  car with accessories you want here.   I came from sort of far away so I had done my homework.  Be sure you don't bring your checkbook and devise an alternative method of payment! and bring your social security card-things have changed I guess since the last time I bought a car.  I would come here again and highly recommend.<//review>

<text>Kyle has excellent customer service skills, he's knowledgeable and professional. He was on top of the repairs and made sure he coordinated with me.Even the adjuster from our insurance  knew him and had nice things to say about him. He made this process easy and painless. The insurance was involved and an adjuster had to show up to see the damage but due to Kyle's established good reputation the adjuster approved everything fast and without any issues and the car was repaired immediately. Thank you for having people like Kyle working for you.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1608217160227, 'text': "Hi there, we are very happy to have provided you with such a positive experience!

Very good experience.
The whole team really took the time to help me in my transaction. Tracey Obermeier was terrific!  She really took the time to see the whole process through. Beautiful selection of cars, easy to get there, very clean and safe. Masks required obviously.<//review>

<Date>1596811526875<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>This dealership has the WORST customer service I have ever received. I was the middle of the day on a Thursday, so myself and one other couple were the only ones at the dealership... WE WERE THERE FOR 6 HOURS. Financial services was taking their sweet time while our stomachs were literally eating themselves. They did not even give us a reference on the amount of time we should wait (cough cough... 2.5 hours) so we did leave in the meantime to go get food. Again, I will remind you that no one was before us for financial services because no one was even there. After buying my car and getting the heck out of there, they failed to give me my second pair of keys. It has been a month and a half, I call, and they say they have not even been shipped yet?? I understand if they were already shipped and shipping is delayed, but they haven't even put in the effort to give them to me? Next I try to complain to ANYONE that cares, no one does of course nor does anyone respond. Even Mercedes said it is a private dealership? So they are in charge of their own customer service? Well, that is unfortunate, because it sucks. Next I am supposed to currently get my keys from someone, and they won't even text me back. This place is quite literally the filled with the most careless employees. It is truly tarnishing Mercedes Benz's brand for me - will keep this in mind for my next car.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1608220391961, 'text': 'Hi there, we apologize for the delayed response.

Of all the cars i have leased in my life, this was by far the easiest, most pleasant experience i have had.  Primarily due to the customer care of a gentleman named Niko. I have already referred two individuals who are interested in leasing cars to Niko.  He is definitely a huge asset to your team.  Thank you. Great experience!</review>

This is my third time bringing my Mercedes in for service George, my mechanic I love him dearly he does unbelievable work never does more than what is needed, Jason who is the representative always polite always on cue very professional.

I was a little put off today when I was in the retail area and a mother and daughter were abusing verbally the young woman at the desk who was very polite I’ve dealt with her numerous occasions she’s always she's been very professional and courteous, I was shocked at the stuck up over privileged attitude the mother and daughter had towards the young woman Angelina I had to sit there and keep my mouth shut though as it wasn’t my business.<//Text>

<text>At he height of the pandemic in Nov 2020, Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas is not a safe place with many workers and some customers walking around without masks and possibly exposing it's employees and the public to Covid-19.  Beware. The service itself is pricey but ok.< /text>< Pictures>

Before you purchase your parts here you might want to double check the price with another dealer, they quoted me a price that was %40 higher then the dealer down the road and that's no pocket change.</review>

I always experience excellent service from Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas.  Jason McCann in the Service Department is super professional and accommodating.  Even though the price of maintaining a Mercedes-Benz can be expensive, Jason's demeanor and friendliness makes the experience very pleasant.  During the service I was able to use a loaner and when I picked up my car everything was handles expeditiously.  They conducted everything with COVID-19 safety protocols which made me feel safe, and I very much appreciated that.</Review>

Everyone at Mercedes-Benz were so kind and friendly to me during my visit.  They proceeded to fix my car which they did and sent me on my way with such ease.  What wonderful customer service!  What trust I can place in everyone at Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas to keep my car in perfect working order.  Thank you. D. Manda<//text>

Tracy Obermeier was an absolute pleasure to work with. When we called to inquire about the vehicle we wanted to purchase we immediately knew we wanted to give her our business. Tracy was professional, kind and went above and beyond for us on her day off. We appreciate Tracy and Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas!< /Review>

Brought the car for AC blower motor malfunctioning. I had an extended warranty on the car. The car was diagnosed that needed a new part for the AC. This was confirmed by my service advisor and the chef principal technician. What struck me was that the technicians couldn't convince the inspector from the extended warranty that there was an existing problem.
The technician figured out two items that needed attention which was the transmission mount and oil filter housing that needed replacement. These were fixed and I'm happy. However, the main issue is tall remaining. Other than that that I brought the car with n tire damage. When I picked up the car my rear passenger side tire had a nail in it. This I'm a hundred percent sure happened at the dealership. Usually, cars, when serviced, are getting washed before return. I didn't borrow a courtesy car but I didn't get a washed car in return either. This part I'm unhappy about.<//text>

The service that we get from the start of the appointment- Mira the friendly appointment setter, to Danielle who always makes sure that everything is smooth and that we are happy to Jason, our knowledgeable service advisor, to Jason, I think is the manager of the technicians who came out to explain exactly what the part does and how it was being installed, to Angel, the service manager making sure that I am happy- it is really a team effort over there at Calabasas.  They are a shining example of how you want your customers to be treated and also to leave feeling about the service they completed on your car.  I send everyone I know to Calabasas because they really have their act together from start to finish on every level of service.  Everyone always comes back and tells me wow- I cannot believe I got that kind of service from dealer.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>This is the only car dealership I ever want to deal with again! By far the best car buying experience I've ever had.

From the start, working with Tracy from online sales was a great experience. She was knowledgeable and responsive. Most importantly, she was honest. It felt so good to be true that I was expecting the 'hustle' to come when I arrived.

When I got to the dealership, Tracy was great and introduced me to David, the sales manager. Would he be the one who changes things on me? Nope. He actually made the deal even better! That's right, he lowered the price AFTER we made the 150 mile drive to the dealership. Something I've never heard of before. That's it. I knew the catch would come when talking to finance.

When I got in with Raja, I texted my brother and told him the way part was done, but finance always had a trick up their sleeve. To my shock, Raja kept it real, gave us a great rate (1.9%) and didn't slide in any hidden fees. The amount financed was 43 cents lower than the "out the door" price that Tracy and David had promised, which was about $600 less than day we drove up for.

These don't seem like huge reductions and obviously I'm being facetious with the 43 cents, but this was never an experience I've had buying a car before. This is a dealership with class. Definitely worth the drive!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1602639624999< /Date>< resp>

Jason was very personable.  He took an interest in my car and wanted to make sure that everything was done properly. I did not see him when I picked up my car somebody else came out but the two wanted to make sure that everything was done properly and to my satisfaction. They clean my car which I thought was very nice. I’m very happy with the service thank you. I also had a follow up  call the other day to make sure that everything was done to my satisfaction thank you for all your help< /Text>

<Text>First, from the moment I called I was taken care of by Fred! He’s awesome and I really am happy I was able to work with him. He answered the phone, was very direct and confirmed he had the vehicle I was looking for, was willing to work a deal and make it happen all that day. Within the hour I was there and purchasing the exact vehicle I wanted, he offered snacks and food, went above and beyond my entire time I was there. Along with Niko and the finance manager everyone was so cool, professional and just a very fun and energetic sales office there. I would recommend Mercedes Benz Calabasas to all my friends moving forward!</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

For the third or fourth time I didn't see my service consultant at the end of the service. I was hoping I would get some explanation on what has been done and what's going on with my car. I've seen him take a long time chatting with other customers at the end of the service. But he was too busy to see me at the end of my service. I wonder why I don't get the respect he gives to others? I am discourage to get another Mercedes Benz!!!!!!!<//Text>

<Review>Too many wonderful things to list about MBOC. I drove more than 45 minutes to buy my car here, and I will do that every time I need to buy a car.
In fact, I will choose to buy a Mercedes Benz again and again, just so that I can buy it here at Marcedes Benz of Calabasas.
This is the most superior, warmest, and client-focused dealership in California. From the General managers, to the front desk, to the other sales reps, to financing, they all made my buying process so smooth and enjoyable.
I can't say enough about my sales Rep Tracy Obermeier; she exceeded my expectations far beyond customer service and even helped get my three kids comfortable during the process. Thank you, Tracy:-)  Tracy made sure to share all available options for my needs and made sure that I was satisfied With my choice. She even went out of her way to help me solve my indecision of choosing between a black or a white GLS 450.
I can keep writing about my great experience here with Tracy Obermeier and MBOC, and let me not forget the Amazing prices that they offer, better than those that I found from the other dealers online and in person. There is no need to go to those other Mercedes sellers when you can get it from here and with better pricing. (My hubby even agreed with the pricing, which is rare .... Lol)
Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is hands down, the best dealership.
I encourage anyone looking for Genuine outstanding service to come here,  You will be very pleased.
Thank you MBOC😊</Review>< Pictures>

Very poor costumer service, rude and insultive service advisor. Lie you over the phone about the warranty and then make a fun of you when you tell them why you didn’t tell me at first this item is not covered under warranty. Also the lord to me about the process of changing the auxiliary battery. He rudely told me you’re driving a 100K car and asking about the warranty and price. I have asked for the manager and no one was there.
Very disappointing experience< /text>

This last service with my newest Mercedes was as good as before, if not better. The treatment of ALL their employees is nothing but respect and welcoming. And my service advisor (Kyle Weins) was all support for my requests.
And as far as the COVID-19 social distancing goes, they were very professional and responsive.

Thank you to Kyle and the whole Service Team at MB of Calabasas. See you guys later!</Text>< rate>

Kyle is a fantastic service manager!  He communicates quickly and clearly, and always has a fast solution. Juan (service tech) always has the answer to what the problem is- and is on hand to explain directly, as well. Calabasas is lucky to have these two!  Great team<//Text>

Better. I went in and gave them my price range, credit score and was very upfront. Based on the info I gave they explained to me that I would be better off buying a used vehicle than applying for a lease on a new car. I listened and went with a used car instead of looking into a lease.

Today about 3 months later I went with my girlfriend to another Mercedes Benz, this locations sister company in Santa Monica. I was blown away with the deal she got. She was in the same financial position as me and they explained many more options to her. They went over leasing options that included a much lower down payment than mines and much lower monthly payments for a newer vehicle with better options. I left with her happy that she got a great deal but very Distraught that none of these deals were explain to me<//review>< pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>I was disappointed from my service advisor not fulfilling my requests to return my calls as my calls are urgent that I needed a loaner to go to my doctors appt. Left two messages and did not  returned my calls. At the last minute the receptionist answered and took my messages which was my third message.  Finally, service advisor answered my call and said the my car was fine and he can have my car be dropped off since they don't have any loaner available that time. He didn't even apologize, I would expect that from a trained professional Mercedez employees but not instead he said he was on the phone.  Had he informed me of that message earlier from my first call I wouldnt be so panicked of not having a car to get to my doctors appt. and since this doctors appt was made 3 months and I wouldn't want them cancel on me.  After my doctors visit I called and left message to service advisor to apologize of my upsetting tone of voice and asked to call me back so I can schedule to bring back my car for full diagnostic or for service maintenance that is overdue about 184 days. As of today, 8/22/2020 he hasn't returned  my call and I suspect he doesn't want to be of service to my car. If that's the case,  I would like to refer me to a another service advisor that is more lenient and professional in handling customer's issues i.e., prompt in returning calls more especially during emergency situations.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

My experience was wonderful. It is refreshing to have a sales associate like Deniz that answers your questions quickly and is not pushy trying for a hard sell with evasive gimmicks. He worked with us to get a great deal within a few hours. I can definitely say I am a very satisfied customer and would highly recommend anyone looking for a Mercedes to give them a try.<//Review>

Sheena was quick to respond to all of my requests, super friendly, and management helped to make everything work within my budget. The entire experience felt genuine and transparent and without any pressure. Calabasas Mercedes stood head and shoulders above the other Valley Mercedes dealerships. One local Mercedes dealership didn't even respond to my morning messages until the evening; another told me that the car I wanted wasn't in production yet, despite having two on their website for sale; and the other was spotty with communication. This was by far the best experience I have had with a Mercedes dealership in the 15 years I have been driving them.<//Text></record>

<Review>SCAM LIKELY!
Super scam make sure you read negative reviews before purchasing or even entering The Dealership.

They basically advertise cars online that do not exist. To be Frank, this is false advertising.
So I spent my entire day trying to apply for a car by finance. I spent all day calling and calling in regards to a particular car. I gave the stock number to multiple people several times.

They never mentioned once it was sold.
I had to follow up with the dealership all day to start the application for finance. I called and called applied for the loan and no response.

When I showed up to the dealership unannounced. They told me the car sold 5 minutes ago.
This has happened to me at several Mercedes Benz dealerships in regards to cars they post online.

They said the car sold 5 minutes ago what a scripted Scam.

Ok show me the car then no we can’t
Ok who’s the Person buying the car?
They are in the finance department
The finance department was empty I was standing in it talking to a finance manager.
They all had scripted answers and are shady scammers

To think they almost applied for a car loan for a car that doesn’t exist.
This is illegal by far so not do business with liars buy AMERICAN !

Piece of garage representatives and liars

They do this on purpose< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great service for the most part. Some miscommunication in the beginning which led me to having to cancel and reschedule my service appointment which was a tad frustrating. Once i rescheduled they were about 30 mins late picking up my car... most likely because i live 30 mins away but would have been nice for them to factor the travel time into the scheduled time. Employees were nice overall and my car came back looking and driving great.< /review>

I came in to buy Mercedes c300, and I traded in my car. The process was super smooth and their first price was the best I could find. Deniz and Sheena were super helpful, and would definitely do business with them again.<//review>

<Text>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! From the very beginning of the hunt for my new family car, the Mercedes Calabasas team was on top of it.  We went through all the important safe features I was looking for and learned about all the incredible bells and whistles on the new GLE350.  It is beyond impressive for its class and I feel incredibly safe with my new baby boy!

Everyone from the reception desk to the sales team was so accommodating and friendly. I got the pleasure of working with David, Sheena, and Nico to negotiate my package with the miles and rate I was comfortable with.  This dealership has a real family vibe that made me feel like I am part of their team.  I really appreciate them looking out for me and my family.< /Text>< pictures>

This dealership is hands down amazing. If your thinking of buying a Mercedes Benz... Come here! You won’t regret it, I got the BEST deal i could of got possible. Previously me and my wife went to Santa Monica Mercedes and were treated horrible! (W.I. Simonson Mercedes-Benz). Mercedes Benz Of Calabasas changed our mind about Mercedes Benz dealerships. Some are out to get you but some are generally there to help get you into a beautiful car and I can say this dealership does just that. They try there hardest to help you in anyway they can! I give them a 10/10 on customer service. Me and my wife want to give a special thanks too Mori Norollahi, Raja Nassar, and David Amby! There team they got going is elite! They got us ready to sell our 4 series BMW and wanting to get another Mercedes from them. You guys will be seeing us again. Thank YOU 🙏<//review>

< review>
We bought our GLE350 from MB of Calabasas and were very pleased with all services. Starting our first contact Sheena and then assisted by Michael Passage. Mike was just wonderful, not he showed our new car but once purchased was done, he went out of way to drop the car 60 miles away to our home. Further, he came out to our place week after to provide an overview and train my family on our new purchase. I will highly recommend this dealer and their team. It was just a hassle free experience.</review>

<review>My visit went smoothly and without a hitch, thanks to the excellent service provided by your team of technicians. I was especially impressed by Mr. Edward Washington; the Service Advisor. He was knowledgeable, courteous and thorough. His customer service skills are superb.  He took the time to describe to me exactly what was being done and why; also making me aware of a couple of other items that needed attention on the vehicle.   The entire experience was simple and pleasant.  I couldn't have been more pleased.

<review>Had to tow my car and leave it after hours, on a weekend. They got back to me first thing Monday AM, got me a ride back to grab a loaner and made it seamless....only issue was the Service manager, they installed an AC filter incorrectly which ended up in a high pitched whistling (i went in for a steering lock issue).  The manager, did not take accountability, in the end it was the dealership's error. The time he took to assure me it was nothing they did, could have been better used going over the paperwork to see what was actually touched. He did not apologize. I am hoping this helps someone in the future. Time is precious, take the time to look at the paperwork before you push back on the consumer please. especially during Covid, we cant just come back later...Other than that, great experience!< /review><username>Veronica Willingham</username></record></dataset><record>

My experience at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas supersedes any other dealership I have been too! They are truly a 5 star dealership. All of the staff are helpful and friendly, and they have great customer care and service. (They also offer great promotions.) They really take the time to work with their clients and make sure your needs are met.

When bringing my car in, my service advisor has been very accommodating and worked diligently with me to help repair/service my vehicle. Their impeccable team has actually found and repaired other issues that I did not initially take it in for. Their integrity and honesty is truly outstanding. I fully trust this dealership and know the job is going to get done right. Not to mention, every time I bring my car in I always have a good experience! I would highly recommend this dealership for all of your service and car related needs.< /review>

<Text>Usually most people write reviews when they have had a negative experience. The truth is I don't usually write reviews at all but I had such a great experience with the service people at Calabasas Mercedes-Benz that I was truly blow away! I own several MBZ cars and I was taking them to another dealer in the valley for years, countless times I was disappointed with the quality of the service done, promises made and broken. So I decided to give Calabasas MBZ a try that is when I met with Kyle Wiens a service manager there, what can I say this guy is the best along with Angel the service director he goes above and beyond to make you the customer happy! I have never been treated this way from other dealerships with the utmost respect everything from start to finish was done in a very professional way.

When I brought my AMG GT C in for service there were some difficult challenges to deal with and each and everyone one of them was handled by Kyle & Angel. They got all of them done and truly took care of me. Also, the technician Juan is remarkable in the quality of workmanship and the passion he has for the cars he works on is very evident, like they say Juan is the first tech there in the morning and the last to leave at night he has tremendous pride in his workmanship. It shows!

All of this team has old school integrity & values you just don't find anymore! I feel blessed and lucky that I found these guys. I'm a Real Estate Broker in the Calabasas area I will be referring all my real estate associates that own Mercedes- Benz to this team without any hesitation! I would rate all of them with 10 stars if I could.

Thanks again for a great experience.

Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is simply the best.  I have been buying cars from them for the past 25 years and their personalized service exceeds my expectations every time I buy or lease a vehicle or need service.   From the General Manager to the lease retention manager, and all the people from the front desk to finance, and the entire service department are top notch.     I can't say enough about what a special dealership this is.</review>

I have shopped at many of the Mercedes Benz dealers around town and always go back to Calabasas Mercedes Benz.  Jeremy Israel-Tombs is the lease retention manager at Calabasas MB and he is absolutely incredible.  I have now leased two cars and purchased one car through Jeremy at prices that one dealer in the Van Nuys area said was not even remotely possible and other dealers in the area offered that they could only try to come close to the prices I received.

Based on my experience with Calabasas MB, I would never go anywhere else for a MB vehicle.</Text>

<text>Don't bother. Dealt with a sales representative that didn't know as much as I did about the vehicle I came into test drive. Complete disaster.  I was ready to buy but because I was not given correct information or correct pricing on the vehicle everything fell apart.  This was after an entire day. Five hours. These guys didn't value my time. Will never go back here and I advise you not to bother either.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Recently I had taken my GLC300 to Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas for repairs, I was provided a courtesy vehicle which I returned to the dealer without a damage when I picked up my car and left the dealership. Later on I received a call informing me that the loaner was damaged by me. It was not damaged when I returned it to the dealership, the damage must have been done at the dealership after I dropped it off.</Review>

The end review and analysis of the transaction was also very impressive.  You do superb work!

To the other personnel involved, the greeter, the car washer, thank you.< /Text><Time>1571465304709</Time>< rate>

<Text>Very professional customer service and maintenance. I was helped by Jason Grijalva, he was very knowledgeable and informative on my car and the maintenance that was done to it. I have had my car serviced with him several times and each time everything is handled perfectly.

Mr. Anthony Wright is very professional and very helpful. He did let me do the test drive on E300 and E450, and I decided to go with E300. I arrived in the dealership at 5 pm and left with my brand new E300 around 10 pm. Except the waiting time for the finance office, the whole process was very smooth and joyful. I believe, there was only one finance guy and 3 or 4 customers in front of me. That's why I had to wait longer.</text>

It was my first time visiting Mercedes-Benz Of Calabasas and I was really pleased with the quality of service and advice from Eddie and his team. Eddie and his team are amazing. They have the utmost integrity and attention to detail when it comes to looking after my 550E! Eddie also is very professional, knowledgeable and extremely patient and high efficient! He kept updating process info to me and got things done promptly. Many thanks to Seigeo too who’s very polite and caring. In general I highly recommend Eddie and his team, Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas, you’re the best!!!<//text>

Salesman and all staff where great. The only thing  i’d say is it should not take in excess of 4 1/2 hours to purchase a vehicle when you walk in with the vehicle and price basically negotiated prior to arrival.</text>

This car dealer has very GOOD businesses but has very BAD service! After purchasing a pre owned C300 from them, we were abandoned by them! None of promised services has been done by now! Almost 2 months have past!

Updated: Their representative of the financial department has taken care of my case! I appreciate that!</Text>

Mori Norillahi’s customer service was awesome! I never felt any kind of pressure to buy my car. She was very knowledgeable, patient, friendly & communicated every step of the way. The dealership was good, clean & prices are reasonable. They have a lot of friendly people & easy to work with. Would definitely go back again specially to work with Mori 💕</text>

I have owned several Mercedes over the years, from several dealerships, but Calabasas Mercedes service department is by far the best I've experienced.  Just the other day I drove in with a dead battery and they were able to accommodate me without an appointment and replaced the battery. I was going out of town on the weekend and it was critical that the battery be replaced and they did not blink an eye and took care of it. In addition, I've had my A&B services done on time and with great care and my car's run fantastic. If you need to wait the waiting area is nice and large and clean complete with coffee and sweets and people are very nice acknowledging you with hello and how can I help you.

If you need a loaner, call ahead and reserve for they disappear quickly.  They also have a shuttle if the loaner car is not available.</text>

<text>I have been so pleased after having my car worked on here. They are very professional and sincerely listened to all of my concerns. They went on a drive with me to listen to the noise I was hearing and never made me feel silly or anything while I was trying to explain how it sounded. I was always greeted immediately upon arrival and not left waiting. I really appreciated the updates while my car was there and It was ready a day earlier then expected. I was offered a loaner car which was great. Its so refreshing to find out that real old fashioned customer service is still available and reputable places such as this.
I highly recommend this dealership for any service related issues.< /text></record>

I have had superb service starting with my salesman, Andrew Hartman to the service department. I am given a courtesy car and I am treated remarkably well by each of Mercedes Calabasas team members. They are very personable and go way over and above to answer any questions or concerns I may have.

I will continue to give all my current and future business along with referrals to friends, family and others I care about. I know how great my sales experience with Mr. Andrew Hartman was and he  has won all of my future business hands down!  He is Very knowledgeable and worked incredibly hard to make me happy and get me in right car. I am as ecstatic with my new car today and I still love it just as much the day I bought it. I am also very pleased with the extended warranties Mercedes has to offer I bought them all and have piece of mind because them.

Thank you Mercedes Calabasas,

Kerry L. Bond</review>

<Review>Horrible Business Practice. They ran my credit 3 times for no reason. My credit is above 800 and I can easily get approved from any bank. I thought it was normal but after reading through other reviews I realized what was happening. I would not buy from this dealer again!<//Review><Rating>1< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Mercedes Benz at Calabasas is the best dealership and service across the board. Servicing our 2001 and 1998 here, I knew this was the place to buy/lease two new replacements (one last year and one the other day). Fred Keshani is my sales rep and makes the whole process easy and exciting!  Really!  Even my son was impressed and knows Mercedes Benz means more than a luxury car...<//review>< pics>

My buying experience was excellent...  Akeyla, my sales advisor, was knowledgeable, personable, and overall a pleasure to interact with.  I would really like to stress how enjoyable it was to purchase a car from someone who was down to earth and truly listened to my needs.   I would certainly return to your dealership to buy my next Mercedes!</text>

<Review>Operating with parity among all of his customers, Jeff Pierson of Calabasas is a first class certified salesman for Mercedes-Benz.  Jeff offers industry leading technical knowledge of the vehicle he is selling.  His attention to me and the timeliness that he addressed my detailed and in-depth questions was unparalleled.  Jeff treats all of his customer with dignity and respect and Calabasas is fortunate to have a representative who has used each year of his experience at the dealership as a scaffolding from which he further develops his knowledge of Mercedes-Benz products, fine-tuning his offers to the desires of his customers, which he can only do because he takes the time to understand his customers.  Jeff truly valued me as a customer,  demonstrated by his actions, and as a result, he was able to effectively build trust as he stood firm behind the elite Mercedes-Benz product.   When Jeff's parting words were "welcome to the Mercedes-Benz family" I found his welcome sincere and his offer to see him as a resource for any future questions to come. Readers, you want this unmatched salesman when you step on this or any other dealership lot. -Rita C.</Review>< Resp>

<review>I bought my car 1 week ago. So i called to make an appointment right after work and the girl was so nice and transferred my call to MICHAEL PASSAGE! and he said just come on in and ask for me once you are here! Once i arrived i was so amazed on how nice everyone was! I have never owned a mercedes nor no one that i knew but when i saw the cla 250 grill i fell in. lOVE ... Mike already had the car waiting for me, ready to test drive . I immediately loved it and said im taking this home, mike made everything so much easier and everyone was supper nice , offering coffee and water but i was just Soo nervous that i couldnt believe i was about to get me a Mercedes Cla 250 for my valentines gift :) i always drove by and never thought i would ever walk in but i dont regret it every one was sooo nice and did not make me feel uncomfortable at all. Everyone kept trying their best To get me a better deal even after i had agreed on the first over and WOW if i could hive them a thousand stars i would !! Mike was great and so was his team, then Rosa in finance was amazing and super nice!! Thank you all for everything! You want a mercedes come hereee dont think about it !!  Ask for MIKE!!

This is my second Mercedes with Calabasas.   They are wonderful and Kyle is a dream to deal with.   First time ever, that they do what they say they are going to do and we have been through a lot.  As a single woman, your car is important and that you can trust it will never leave you stranded. Day or night Calabasas Dealership has helped me and I can rely on them. Even for service they have a loaner ready for me.  I highly recommend them.</Review>

love the fact that they value my time and work around my schedule to fit me in. I used to deal with another Mercedes dealership who was just interested in selling me the car. I chose to move my business to this dealership almost 2 years ago and have been coming back ever since. They take the time to explain the recommended work and do not push you into services you were not expecting. Great after service follow up, straight forward pricing and very competitive.

Excellent customer service.  Wonderful service experience.  Kyle was very responsive, and assisted promptly to my emailed request of a service appointment and even arranged a loaner vehicle for use.  Ryan was very professional when he met me in the service bay, and explained all service line items clearly and completely.  I drive in from the Palm Springs area, and appreciate the time they take to service my GL450, and the arrangement of a loaner so I can run around town and enjoy the local beaches while I know my car is being well taken cared for.  Thank you gentlemen...<//Review>

I was told that a certified 2017 Mercedes c300 was ready to buy and in outstanding condition but when I flew 2700 miles to California to test drive and with plans to buy, the car had been painted on the quarter panel. They told me that I had to come back on Friday to relook at it after already paying to fly there. They are a shady company that lies to make money and don’t care about the customer. I would tell anyone who plans to buy from them to check the car out well and don’t fly into see a car here because you just might be disappointed like I was. They also try to over charge to ship and if you don’t allow them to ship the car, they try to charge 10% extra  to allow a place of your choice to ship.I blame management there because they are the ones who allow this unprofessional behavior. I wasted money on a flight and in having to use Uber to travel to California empty handed. An angry customer due to unprofessionalism and deception . I definitely won’t be coming back to California to buy a car. I definitely learned the hard way so please don’t do what I did. Smh<//text>

<text>We bought a used car from James Pugliese. James is your typical used car sales person cliché. When he learned i was interested in the vehicle, he was persistent in his contact, and mostly helpful, although I wouldn't suggest detail is his strong point.
During our purchase, the tone was one of coercive and rushed selling. Any request we made was met with "someone is coming to look at this vehicle later and I can sell it to them". Our main concern was having the car looked over by a mechanic which was refused under all circumstances.
We purchased the car anyway - it is a beautiful car and we are happy to have it.
However, the car began leaking oil a day after we purchased it. We attempted to contact James to discuss the matter. It would seem James' customer service ends at the sale and he possesses no after sales interest. The moment we registered the problem, he would not return any calls despite his assurance that he would.
After 3 days of being ignored we escalated to the used care sales manager Jose. Jose immediately dealt with the problem, invited the car for an inspection and organised its repair. Jose was communicative, polite and helpful. The problem was eventually resolved.
Despite the pre and after sales service of James, this is a good car at a good price from a dealership that will eventually do the right thing by their customer. I would buy from them again. But not from James.< /text><resp>{'time': 1608217219822, 'text': "Hello Druid Charlotte, we appreciate you taking the time to leave us this feedback.

<Review>As I began my online search and knew this was the model that I desired, and that I wanted the car to be Certified and bought through a Benz dealership. Two car models stood out to me immediately as meeting the criteria, so I filled out my contact information and was immediately contacted by both online dealers. Sheena Farentino sent me a very warm and pleasant e-mail and I received one more e-mail from another local MB dealer.

I responded to Sheena via text and immediately got the feeling that she was someone I wanted to do business with. She was extremely communicative and helpful with all the questions I had. When I came to test drive the vehicle, she made sure that it was washed and pulled out to the front and that even though she was held up with another buyer, that I was helped in a timely manner by her associate, Andrew.

Andrew was equally as helpful and friendly in answering any questions I had. When it came to closing the deal, I was deciding between your car and a comparable model at the other dealer. The price points were similar and the cars were similar, but what truly was the deciding factor between the two cars was my experience at both dealerships.

I chose to do business at MB Calabasas because Sheena and the rest of the team. I cannot say enough positive things about Sheena- from her grabbing me an Starbucks iced coffee while I waited, to her moving and organizing all of my belongings from my trade-in vehicle to my new car, while I was in finance.

Since the deal closed so late, I decided to come back later that week and Sheena took the time to drive with me around the block and show me all of my new car’s capabilities. She has checked in with me multiple times since the purchase and we have kept in touch. In the future, I will be referring everyone looking to buy a new car to your dealership and specifically to Sheena. When it comes that time where I am in the market for another car, she will be the first person I call!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Molly Carmody<//username>< Response>

I brought my 2015 C300 here after being at another Mercedes Benz dealership in the San Fernando Valley for a better part of 2 months. Mercedes Benz of Calabasas was able to fix the problem while the other dealership keeps saying the engine noise that my car makes is normal. The service foreman Jay is very knowledgeable and Kyle the service consultant is very receptive. I give them the highest rating possible.</Text>

Excellent service. Their service department is very responsible and honest. I had an issue with my brakes for my brand new MB GLS 450 and they pro-actively took care of it free of charge.</Text>

I just got my AMG GTC coupe from Mercedes Benz of Calabases, from the first day which I went to dealership and I meet Anna and Michel I knew this will be the place to purchase my new car. They both have the experience and the professional attitude I was expecting
.My car came and the price and the service of the team including Niko and Rajah was amazing. As a matter of fact I just refer them one of my coworkers to purchase his car. Thank you Anna, Michel, Niko, Raja and the rest of the team.

Best DAMN Service I have ever received. JEFF P is the best car dealer ever there was no hassling or anything he basically gave me all the info I need. I told him I didn't want o be sitting in no dealership for hours going over money and prices. I threw out a number that  I felt was fair he asked his boss. They set it up I got there before close time and was out literally in 2 hours and that included the test drive and the side conversations we kept having,. He was very professional and funny and humble. We made things happen and it was the best. The Finance guy Misha was another guy that helped me out and very smart money man. Got me the best loan option available. These men at Calabasas Mercedes can get my business and referral anytime. Try it out for yourself.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Very Disappointed with the Service Department.
One-hour Express Service means 4 Hours.
When making the appointment I asked several times about how long the Express Service will take, and she assured me not longer than an hour for Schedule A Service (which basically is just an oil change for $250)
After two hours of waiting I asked Jason if the car is ready and he replied asking if I need Schedule A service done as well.
How horrible is that when I made the appointment for that specific service and that is what I asked for when I checked in.
The car wash was just as bad, rinsing the car with water, makes me wonder if the services performed are the same way!
will definitely not recommend this dealership and will not be coming back either.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>My experience with the sales person, Angie Robles, was very good. The Used Car Manager, Jose Leyva, was smug and condescending. After hours selecting a vehicle and agreeing upon a price, the paperwork arrived to show an extra $600. This is for, apparently, a protective coating and phantom footprint — the classic undercoating hoax! I told Mr. Leyva that I didn't want these, but he refused to remove them. After much argument he reduced the price by half. However, this is simply duplicitous.
Now having driven the car for a few thousand miles I'm happy, overall, with the vehicle. However, a front wheel shudder under braking continues to worsen, rattles have appeared, and the premium speaker system has intermittent buzzing. Wrapping up paperwork to accept the car, I noticed an error in the CPO inspection, which Mr. Leyva simply dismissed. He also declined to repair a stitching issue on the front passenger seat. I've had 3 CPO 3 Series BMWs, with flawless experiences. I moved to MBZ because of the unlimited mileage warranties, so I do know the car is covered, however while I think the car was prepared for resale, I get the strong impression that it did not go through the stated rigorous CPO examination.
MBZ Calabasas definitely had the best price for their CPO vehicles, but I don't know if I'd return or if I would recommend to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more to know that I'm being properly looked after, such as I was with BMW.<//review><Response>{'time': 1608220300038, 'text': 'Hi there, we apologize for the delayed response.

I absolutely love my car but drive the heck out of it.  I work full time and go to college full time.  I take that car everywhere.  I get dents and scratches and random things done to it on campus.   During finals, my brain is barely screwed on so I tend to take it out on my car.  I recently went over a cement parking block in my work parking lot.  The block tore the front bumper a bit from the car.  Came in on Saturday for an oil change and to get an estimate on of the bumper.  They gave me a loaner so that I could go back to school to continue studying.  They had the oil change and bumper fixed on the same day.  The customer service is absolute wonderful and they do not waste any of your time.  As long as I live in Woodland Hills, I will always own a car from Mercedes-Benz Calabasas.<//review><Name>Brandi Kaufman< /Name></record>

<review>My wife purchased a used car here a few months ago and the battery went dead, as it turns out it was old, but apparently checked out okay. They ended up replacing the battery, fixed a sidelight bulb issue, and of course washed and vacuumed the car... no charge. We were relieved at their desire to do what was right and greatly appreciated Jason (service dept.), going to bat for us. You've kept a customer.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2</GmapID></record>

<review>The customer service, is consistent.  They are always able to accommodate my busy schedule.  I love having updated information on my car.

I am on my 3rd Benz since I started taking my cars to Calabasas. This visit was to get my 2019 CLA250 serviced. As always, they allowed me a service vehicle and everything was handled professionally and timely.

I totally trust and appreciate this dealership. They really take care of you and the staff is awesome!!!!< /review>< Name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Found a used 2014 E63S I was interested in on their website. Clicked on the help me box and was told the car had been sold.  I gave Deniz (in charge of Internet Sales) my number and asked him to keep an eye out for another E63S.  Deniz gave me a call a couple of days later; the sale of the original E63S fell through and the car was again available.  I made arrangements to see the car that day. Everyone was very friendly. No pressure sales. A good experience all the way around. Deniz even drove my new Mercedes back to my house for me and took an Uber back to the dealership against my wishes because he didn't want to take up any more of my evening by letting me drive him back.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2<//Gmap_id></record>

After visiting many websites and using too many search engines. I called Mercedes Calabasas.   it was the best experience I ever had. the process was painless. I found a my 2016 Range Rover on their lot and I was in and out of the dealership within a minimum of two hours. From the moment I met the Financial services manager the customer service was awesome. From the start to the finish the customer service was the best.

Thanks,<//text>

Easily the worst of the nearby Mercedes dealerships. I would highly recommend visiting the Thousand Oaks or Encino dealerships if quality service is something that matters to you.

As a new customer looking to buy a car I spent nearly 20 min. on the sales floor without anyone so much as introducing themselves to me.  When I mentioned to one of the sales people that it would be nice if they at least greeted the customers, he responded by saying “what the hell man, we’re not slaves”. Any chance of me buying a car from this dealership went out the window with that level of rudeness.

Trust that there are better, more professional dealerships in the area.</text>

Anna and her assistant Sheena were fabulous in assisting me with my recent lease.  Their level of customer service was beyond professional and accommodating in true first-class style.  I did not have to sit at the dealership and wait around for one moment.  Everything was handled and my vehicle was personally delivered to me.  If you are in the market for a Mercedes vehicle and live in the valley communities of Los Angeles, look no further than Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas.  You will completely appreciate the way they take care of you.</Text>

That was until we bought 2 MB from MB Calabasas. They have exceeded all of our expectations (as a prior Lexus owner)  above and beyond what we had hoped. Got to admit those folks know how to service the car and the customer. I'd give them a 6 star rating if they had one.</Text><user_id>109446225936844867507< /user_id><Name>Elliott Balbert<//Name>< pics>

I came in with a check engine light without an appointment on a busy Saturday. Munajj was good enough to assist me. He made is simple, fast and efficient. He got me a loaner (convertible) that had just been returned and got me on my way. Picked up my car a week later and was running smoother than ever! Top quality customer service from Munajj and all employees!</Text>

I was both surprised and extremely grateful at the patience and professionalism that Daniel Gad displayed towards me when I came into the service department with some questions last week. He took the time to explain all of his answers in a way that even I could understand them. I really appreciate service like this and guarantee I will come to him with all of my future car needs and questions!<//text>

< Review>
OUT OF STATE BUYERS: Responsive, transparent, and Sheena seemed nice. We had agreed on the purchase verbally back on 10/4 (For the full asking price). I was told that they are unable to accept a deposit and put a vehicle on hold, which was strange. I'm an out of state buyer so the contract docs needed to be sent to me via Fedex which may have thrown a wrench in the process. With cash in hand, and ready to buy, the car was sold out from under us. This was after being contacted on 10/7 asking for our identification and insurance info which was sent back within 10 minutes of asking.  Disappointing and strange attempted car buying experience. Due to the wait (still not sure why I couldn't wire them the money Friday, Saturday, or Sunday....) we also missed out on the other vehicle we were considering at a different dealership.</Review>

<Review>Best car buying experience of my life.  After going to several dealerships that seemed less than thrilled to work within my budget, I felt completely comfortable with the salespeople and staff at Mercedes of Calabasas.  As a female shopping on my own, I never felt patronized. Gary Leclaire was so patient, and when I asked for 24 hours to consider, he said "no problem, and bring your son back with you".  No one rolled their eyes at an excited toddler, and I left with exactly what I wanted in my budget.  Husband approved too :) Thank you so much!< /Review><GmapID>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2</GmapID>< pictures>

I had the best service at Calabasas Mercedes.   Kyle the Service Consultant was beyond good.   It actually was one of my best experience getting my car serviced.  I actually had a bad experience with the Thousand Oak Mercedes dealer   The services receptionist was very rude.  I didn't even get to the Services Specialist the receptionist was pretty bad at Thousand Oak.  I drove future to Calabasas it made a big difference.   i promise the service you will get is beyond good.</text>

I just bough another car from Calabasas Mercedes, 2017 E300. I think that this is car #7 or 8 that I bought from them over the past ten or twelve years.  If you are looking for the best price AND the best customer service, call Anna , the fleet manager at Calabasas Mercedes, you will not be disappointed!!!

October 2020 update.: The lease expired on the 2017 E class. I called Anna L at the Mercedes of Calabasas and told her what I want to get for the next car.  She promptly located 2021 GLE300 that had all the options I wanted and in a color I wanted.
I turned my old car in, got a great deal on the new one, all in less than 2 hours!!!

As always, great service from Mercedes of Calabasas and Anna L!!!!<//review>

<Review>Mixed feelings. I was on the fence to trade in my car. Felt like my current car wasn’t good enough even though I love my 2006 ML 350!

The when attempting a lease the sales lady questioned my ability to keep up with it. Like she thought I was just gonna trash it. Meanwhile after they inspected my car, I had items in my back that they had taken apart? Or just let fall on the ground? My items were not as I had left them.

Also another sales employee, who was on probation (I don’t know what that means) was a bit nicer in the process but not sure why he’s on probation?!? There’s a bulletin board back by the coffee station. I might try Glendale Mercedes or Downtown LA next time instead.< /Review>< response>

She put a lot of time & effort in locating a vehicle with all my specifications, when inventory was very low. She made the purchase process very convenient and pleasant. Also, Marianna her assistant was very knowledgable and had a lot of patience showing me how to work all the  features the vehicle has to offer. She made it very convenient by come to my residence to teach me.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Going to have my car serviced is like going to the 4 Season’s.  My wonderful service man Steven Schwartz is always there to answer any of my questions.  He makes sure I’m comfortable in the lounge while my car is being taken care of.  The service is fast and someone is always letting you know what is going on.    Thank You Penny Perkins< /review>

They did a good maintenance job, although you will pay more for the same service.  When I asked for a discount, they offered a small one which was amazing.  Getting a loaner vehicle was easy and the employees there exceptional.  They didn't do a great job washing my car, but when my wife went to pick it up, no one came to assist her even though she was the only customer.  She waited for some time before interrupting an employee to get assistance.  Here is where things got weird.  One of the employees flat out lied to her.  Not a mistake, a lie.  Not cool.  Every few months when I have it serviced, they find a $1,000+ issue than needs attention, but that's not their fault.  That the brand, so I may be going back to Lexus very soon.< /text>

<Text>back in April, 2018, I stop by the dealership to take care of my car due to Recall letter. I was assigned to Scott Gomez, assistant Service Manager.
He did a finamenal job from the moment I said Hello till everything was done. Great attitude, and a smile on the face. I had same questions regarding my car and Scott did follow up with me on the professional level.
I would definitely recommend Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas to all my friends and Family!< /Text>< Pictures>

As I gaze at my beautiful car in my driveway, I have to say that I really had my doubts that I could live 400 miles away, buy a Lexus at a Mercedes- Benz dealership, and drive it home the next day.  Well it all started with a call to a sales agent named Sheena at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas, she was perfect at helping me put this transaction in motion.  After explaining my situation to her, she said that if I have plane reservations that the dealership would not only be happy to hold the car, but also pick me and my wife up at the airport.  They also would let my brother and his wife, who are local, come in and test drive the car.  My brother call me, before I stepped on the plane, to say they were very impressed with the people at dealership.  They were all approachable, professional, and just really nice.  He also said the car was perfect and if I didn't buy it, he would.  I couldn't agree more.  This dealership is spotless and the people are customer focus and you can tell it's a fun place to work.  The Lexus LS looked brand new, not 3 years old.  The paperwork was done in minutes because it seemed that Sheena filled it out for me.  Before we left Sheena sat in the car with us and went over all the features the car had to offer.  Remember this is not a Mercedes but she still knew it all.   Who knows, maybe next time I will buy a Mercedes and I won't mind driving it back home.  Thanks, it couldn't have been smoother transaction.</Text>

Most excellent. I had the extended warranty on the lease return I bought there, and it took care of what would have been some spendy repairs on a few engine items that presented themselves at 60K. Fast service with all the extras. They even found what I thought were long-lost Ray-Bans during the vehicle cleaning!< /Review>

Akeyla made our experience a 10/10. We went in expecting to settle for a car that really suit our new family of 3 and she made it possible for us to find one that would be perfect and safe for us. She gave us her honest opinions on what she thought would be best for us instead of of giving us options that would only benefit Mercedes. She truly made me trust her with myself and my 7 month old son and I definitely would recommend anyone, especially those with a family to have her assist you with your needs. She’s understanding and relatable and only wants what is best for your needs. I hope to do business with her and only her the next time around!< /text>

My wife and I were treated respectfully and professionally, even though we are maybe not as "well-heeled" as others there that day to purchase more expensive models.  A good selection of C-Class models in varying trim-lines to choose from.  Marcus in Internet Sales was patient as we narrowed our choice (we drove both the coupe and sedan), and detailed when explaining the cars' features.  Waited a bit longer than expected to get into Finance to sign, but not nearly as long as I've been made to wait at other dealerships (My son and I recently had a truly distasteful experience when he bought his truck).<//text>

I will return to MB of Calabasas for future purchases. The sales staff was courteous, professional. John was present to answer questions, but never overly eager. I purchased a 2016 Challenger Hellcat, the listed price was more than competitive searching and comparing the online auto sites for similar vehicles.

After this experience I will not look at the "traditional" dealerships for our next vehicle purchase.<//review>

UPDATE: Service manager called.  I'm still not thrilled that their system overcharged for the part, but Angel has more than made up for it with a refund credit well in excess of the amount of the overcharge.

The primary reason I came here is because another dealer (in my opinion) was overcharging for parts: charging more than Mercedes recommended retail price.  I confirmed at the time that your price for the same parts was the suggested Mercedes price.  Yet when I came here you have charged me substantially more than the suggested retail price ($268.80 versus the suggested list of $187.00). As my car gets older and will need more parts, this is a consideration and I am very disappointed that you appear to have joined the collection of price-gouging dealers.  Unless there is a good explanation, I doubt I'll be back.</review>

I received a written quote for a GLK . I am over 2 hours away from this dealer but they had exactly what I wanted and the price was great. Upon arrival I drove the car, loved it and filled out my paper work. I waited 4 hours for my turn with the finance department. When it was my turn they discovered the sales guy had made a mistake on the written quote by $6,000.00. In the end, I made that 2+ hour drive back home in my original car. I believe/hope  the sales guy made an honest typo, but no one made any attempt to satisfy me. I offered to meet them half way (pay $3000.00 more than quoted). They are a big profitable organization and I'm just a working stiff. If I could take the hit for $3000.00 so could they. It wasn't my mistake. I had bought a car from them before. You'd think they would care.< /Text>

Yesterday I went to test drive a vehicle at the dealer, and I talked to Carlos Prado who had no idea about the car I test drive. He also had no idea about the value of the car I wanted to trade in, he offered me $1000 less than is the trade it value. We agreed to send pictures of my car today before we came up with the final descion, but today he told me that the car I test drive he sold it yesterday evening. I drove one hour to the dealer to see the car, and I trusted that he will keep his promisse. I did not wanted to trade in my car before I have a trade in value figured out, and I do not wanted to go with the offer he had. Very dissapointed with the actions of this sales person and bis dissapointment.< /review>

I took my MB c250 for service and I am very satisfied with the professional service that I received. Steve Schwartz. was very attentive and very kind. He will make an extra effort to satisfy the customer. Calabasas Mercedes is about 20 miles from where I live but I wouldn't mind driving that far for excellent service......Highly recommended!</review>

I had a terrific experience at Mercedes of Calabasas. My salesperson, Marcus S, was a total mensch! The guy is aces! He seemed genuinely concerned with my satisfaction, happiness AND well being--in that he made efforts to consider my budget and guide me to the most responsible choice. And I heap the same accolades upon the tremendous finance department who made great efforts to get me into my new ride. The whole experience was excellent and I am grateful to the entire staff for their low pressure and conscientious approach. And the car, well, the E300 just rocks!
Thank you M of Calabasas. I love my new ride.< /text>

David worked diligently and patiently with me to find the perfect vehicle for my situation and budget. Throughout the entire process, David was sincere, professional, knowledgeable, and ready to answer every question. Everyone else whom I worked with at the dealership (e.g. Sales, Finance, ) were similarly welcoming, helpful, and professional. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy or lease a vehicle.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Taking your car to Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is a stress free and wonderful experience.  First class operation all the way.  They held a car clinic and noted that my back tires were bald.  I could have really been in trouble on the highway.  I highly recommend , the service is off the charts!<//Text>

Great place to have your Mercedes maintained. Although these are great works of art and completely reliable, they too need regular maintenance. I'm very grateful for the professionalism showed to me even when I'm going in for little things. Daniel G, ranks amongst the best in customer care. It’s always a pleasure stopping by!< /Review>

My new car was delivered to my door. The process was quick and easy - my sales representative had all the paperwork, was able to guide me through it quickly, and was very friendly.

He took the time to show me the features of my new car, and was in and out in an hour. Fantastic experience!<//Review>

When I arrived Jason met me and explained his (well deserved) promotion. Introduced me to Elan
It was the best experience possible
I thank them both!

I was looking for a car for a while. I searched in my area for about 2 months. I extended my search and found MB Calabasas. I called in and spoke to Jeff. He was very straight forward, and honest with me and really fought to get me a deal and a car I really love. He took a lot of time to explain to me exactly how the car works, how the warranty works, etc. In my honest opinion, this guys one of the best sales guys I have ever met. I literally drove 2 hours to come to this specific dealership to purchase my car. I will never go anywhere else to purchase a car.

When it came to finance I worked with Zavier. This guy made financing so easy, it was amazing!</review>

Car was checked in immediately upon arrival.  Jason McCann sent it to Service for Service B.  I think it was about two hours and my car had its servicing, a clean bill of health and I was on my way.

Poor management. I had the worst experience with them. I went in last week to lease a car. Really high credit score, and high income. They told me it’s all approved, and I need to go back the next day to do the paperworks and finish up the deal. The next day they told me I can’t get the car, because I already have an open auto. They ran my credit twice!!!
So I went to BMW, and they ran my credit once, after Mercedes already did that twice. Anyways I got approved, and bought an even more expensive car.
I just don’t understand what happened right there at Mercedes.<//text>

Kyle in the service department is exceptional.. I have been taking my car there now for a few times and couldn't be more happier. He explains everything and that is needed and even points out things to make me aware, and offers suggestions. I really feel like I am being taken care of. Best service advisor ever. I have recommended him to others. If you need an advisor go see Kyle.< /Text>

Sadly the Mercedes brand is not a luxury brand in our household. Our R350 is a lemon and has had nothing but problems since we bought it used with 30K miles. Thankfully we bought the extended warranty, but at 100K miles it's now past warranty. The back hatch won't open and the "safety" latch they put in doesn't work either. So they want $2500 to fix it. Calabasas had me wait from 12:00-1:00 so ALL their service people could take lunch together. Are they a doctor's office? Then when I got there at 1:30 the car was not fixed, not ready, and not washed. I left at close to 2 pm with a dirty car that they want $2500 to fix. I will take it to an independent service person and spend $500. What a rip off. Then I will sell the car and buy a Lexus or BMW. My other car is a Lexus, same mileage, and all I change are tires, oil and brakes. GREAT brand.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>2005 ML350 was in for a Transmission Service and a problem with the Passenger side rear window Power Window Regulator. The window was expensive to do. As always, Ryan Collins, my service advisor was as efficient as ever and the work was done well and on time. My car has nearly 187,000 miles on it and I still prefer to visit my MB Dealership because overall, I really feel it is the most cost efficient for me, based on previous experiences with private MB repair centers who may not repair the problem correctly.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Tim AhSing< /Name><gmap_id>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2<//gmap_id>< userid>

As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted in a very friendly and professional manner. John Nazarian, our sales consultant was extremely personable, knowledge, patient  and made our experience pleasurable. We did not feel pressured or pushed at any time, which is what I was dreading in car shopping. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the Calabasas dealership as all personnel were engaging and professional. We are so happy that we purchased our E350 there and will go back there again to John if we need a new car.<//Review>

Engine light came on close to my A service date. It revealed needed repairs that was taken care of. Jason McCann is my service adviser and as usual he takes care of my S550. Sorry if I misspelled his last name wrong.< /text>

I live closer to another Mercedes-Benz dealer but I choose to travel further to Calabasas for service because: the staff always has a smile, the facility is beautiful and comfortable if you want to wait, loaner cars are available if you cannot wait, and they are efficient. Furthermore, I trust them.< /review>

I recently had my vehicle serviced and as always was very pleased with the outcome.  The  Service Advisor, Steve was very efficient and even provided a rebate offer that reduced the service fees.  I will continue to bring my vehicle  here whenever it needs servicing.  I highly recommend Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas!</Text>

<text>I was very hesitate of getting a Mercedes as I was a BMW girl for many years. I wanted to try something new and decided to switch to Mercedes, and I'm glad I did. I got my car at another location , but have really got all my needs taken care of at Calabasas. Everyone has been so nice to me and accommodating. Jason is my service advisor and he is great!!!!! I am big on customer service and his personality alone is what makes me stay loyal to Mercedes. I normally don't take the time out to write reviews and all, but I must give credit when it is due. For your next car, I would highly recommend giving Mercedes of Calabasas a chance.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><user>106039549640749966484</user>< date>

My service light came on and I have my morning off. So, even without making an appointment, I took my chance and drove in to see if they can accommodate  me. Sure enough, service adviser Eddie was able to help me. Eddie had been most helpful and courteous, and my car was ready as promised the same afternoon. Very happy with my experience at Calabasas MBZ.<//text>

I was very pleased with the attention and service provided to me last week.
I was provided with a loaner car which was essential for me to take care of matters and was unable to wait for the time required for inspection.
Thank your people for their concern and polite attitude in helping me out personally.

<Text>I have to say, i have been taken care better on previous occasions. This time it was challenging to get a service representative to even answer the phone to get an appointment, it took three calls. Then the service representative was unreachable through the day.
Customer service has been better, i hope it doesn't start to decline.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Mercedes-Benz Calabasas gives the worst customer service of any dealer that I have ever been to. When I scheduled my appointment for delivery I was pre-approved from my credit union, so they only needed to prepare the paperwork, which they didn't do. I waited nearly 2 hours and there was no one ahead of me. It took over 2 hours to complete, and I missed an important business meeting costing me a major deal. When I took delivery of the car it was totally messed up by their staff. They ruined the front bumper, scratched and dented the paint, put swirl marks in the paint, left cleaning residue inside on the wood and leather, and they did not put any gas in it. They told me that I had to take the car since I purchased it and I didn't take the restocking option. Upon leaving I realized that the steering and brakes were bad. I had to get the alignment done along with new brakes at my expense. No one from Calabasas called or returned my phone calls. I'm having to replace the front bumper and paint the car. Corporate told me it's a problem between Calabasas and me, so good luck. I live over 2 hours away, and these guys have offered zero help or response. No calls of any kind. To top it off, they never registered it with the DMV, even though I paid them. Now I have to go the DMV and register it again! This has cost me thousands above the purchase price. They sent my credit application to several banks even though I was pre-approved by my own credit union. NEVER DO ANY BUSINESS WITH CALABASAS!!!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I recently went into the service department with routine questions about my car and had the opportunity to speak with Daniel Gad. I couldn't believe how nice he was first of all, but also he was extremely thorough in all his explanations and went over all my questions with me. I would definitely recommend this service department and Daniel to anyone that needs service. Thank you so much, it makes a big difference when you have a reliable and knowledgeable person to help you.</Review>

The Sales Agent (Sheena Baca) was extremely professional, supportive and accommodating. I felt absolutely no pressure during the purchase. She made me feel relaxed and welcomed. She also worked very hard with me to make sure all my concerns are addressed, effectively and expeditiously. Overall, a very pleasant experience.< /text>

I bought a Cadillac from this dealership, there was a lot of issues with the car, some parts was missing and i had to point them out so they can get it fixed, Still some parts are missing which i report this parts to my sales assistant but still waiting to get any kind of response. Maybe they do much better if you buy one of their own cars. They used a cheeky sales technique which i did not realized what they done after i took the car home and looked at my sales invoice a bit more in details . Overall OK but next time i buy a $60,000 car from its own dealership.< /review>

It was truly a very easy and rather unique experience at a car dealership. They worked with me in getting a better valuation on my trade in and at the same time gave me an additional discount on the purchase price. Totally unexpected and very much appreciated. From Arin, the sales representative to the team working on the price and valuation of my trade in to the financing of the car, it was a first class experience.</Review>

My service rep, Alon, has always treated me like a VIP with his amazing service each and every time I come to Mercedes service. He always makes sure I am completely satisfied before I leave. I expect to purchase another Mercedes when my lease is up this coming February and definitely want to keep Alon as my service advisor.
On another note Mercedes makes an incredible car. I also leased a new Bentley just recently and it does not give me the satisfaction in driving that I get with my Mercedes. I am now trying to sell it so I can get another Mercedes.<//Text>

I have been a customer of Mercedes Benz Calabasas since 2004 and their Service Department is the best in the industry.  Jason McCann & Eddie Aquino are likewise the BEST since they always provide not only me but my family as well the unparreled service experience.  Mercedes Calabasas is very fortunate to have these folks in their ranks.</Review>

<text>After buy my fifth vehicle from this establishment I thought I would be treated like family, however that was in now way at all the case. My car wasn't even detailed when I purchased it. No follow up on my experience from sales personnel was even done. It sure don't benefit me in anyway to be negative about situations because I always choose to see the best in every situation, but none thing is for sure, I will never ever purchase another car from Mercedes Benz of calabasas.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Great service all around. Walked in and was greeted by Veron the sales person there. Wife was looking for a new E300. He gave us a good deal and it was pretty smooth unlike our past experience with dealers. I would so recommend him to any of my friends and family. Good job guys.<//Review>

<Review>After tireless going to many dealerships in search of good service, I called Mercedes Calabasas.  From the moment I heard Nicks cheerful confident voice, I new He was going to find me the car I wanted.  My husband and I were so picky.  We wanted a fully loaded 2017 GLA with dark exterior and a light interior.  Only so many were made and we did not want the new 2018 due to body style changes.  Nick pretty much called every dealership to find the car!  He also is a Mercedes Guru!  He has incredible follow up. Not only are we going back for another Mercedes but we are coming back to work with Nick Argos.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is my favorite car dealer for auto-servicing and genuine MB parts. I have been going there for over 12 years now and the customer service experience I get is always phenomenal. Kyle is my service rep and he does an outstanding job in getting me taken care of, from putting me into a loaner vehicle to keeping updated in a timely fashion, based on the feedback he gets from the Mercedes technicians. It is always such an invigorating and blissful experience working with him. Mira is also such a sweetie pie, she constantly wants to make sure that the customer has the attention they deserve and she is quick in going the extra mile for any customer that walks through their doors. I would recommend anyone that owns a MB vehicle to come here for their service needs or to purchase their OEM MB parts, because Oscar, Wilmer and the rest of the Parts crew are always ready to help you out with any of your parts needs. Overall - the entire dealer experience is like no other.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>One of the worst experiences all around. No one was doing there job to Mercedes standards. I’ve been driving Mercedes for 20 years and I am considering selling my car because of issues. I had to take my car 3 times for the stereo sound. In the end finally they replaced the speakers. This last time I had a check engine light at 35000 miles, I was told and don’t think the people working there know very much, it was an ignition coil. Why did that go out already? Service adviser has never been a mechanic, I have. When I came in that afternoon there were no loaner car so I was dropped at enterprise with no paperwork or instructions and a guy who didn’t understand or speak English. Enterprise had one Toyota truck  when I got there and 3 people waiting. Dealership was closing. I had to make 3 phone calls to get through to my service rep. By then I was paying for an Uber to me home. In the morning I had to Uber again back which cost me more money. On Friday 2:30 I get a call my car is done. I can’t pick it up with a 2 hour window, I work in LA. Weekend goes by. There is stuff in my car I can’t get. Then when I get my car back there is damage to the door rubber the steering wheel. I have to go back because your text was not carful. I spoke with the shop Forman and he knew how upset I was about the situation. And he did not bother to check on an upset customers job. I am in customer service, sales and retail. Your is horrible. I will be going to a different dealership where the people know something.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I would like to recognize Kyle at Calabasas service department for his professionalism, excellent costumer service & pleasant attitude.
This gentleman updated me consanly about my car.
He was FANTASTIC & it was a pleasure to meet Kyle
Also I would like to recognize Jason G for his OUTSTANDING costumer service to make my visit to calabasas Service departmental smooth & easy. I am so llucky to be assigned to Jason Gy as my service advisor , during his absence he assigned to his colleague Kyle who I had a please to meet.
MBZ should recognize these gentlemen KYLE & Jason G for best employees with  their EXCELLENT COSTUMER SERVICE<//Review>

I wish there is a different way of giving stars. Five stars for Jeremy R, my sales, Jason and Angel in the service department.
I was getting my third car from Calabasas last week, the sales has always been amazing.  I dealt with Artie for years before,  and Jeremy R was my sales this time, he was so awesome, made it very easy and offered me very good deal, very professional, and accommodating. The service department Jason and Angle were great too, they took care of my brand new E300, and explained the problem.
But the sales manager Pete was incredible rude when he saw my first review of what happened to my new car and my experience  (since removed), he called me and said if I want more help I need to take off the review and hung up on me.  Even worse when I went pick up my car,  he told me to get out of his sales building and I am not welcome, and he was glad that he doesn't have to deal with me any more. if I wasn't a woman and Asian, I wouldn't be treated that way.
My new car had trouble twice, instead of enjoying it,  I had experienced a lot of frustration and wasted a lot of energy dealing with it, I didn't deserve the way Pete treated me, it was very unprofessional.</Review>

Hands down working with Anna at Calabasas Mercedes Benz was the easiest car buying experience ever. I was able to finalized everything over the phone and came in to pick up my new ride. Got her number from a buddy of mine who's got cars from her in the past and he was dead on. Nice dealership too people were friendly and receptionist was helpful<//Review>

It took more than 5 weeks. I was given a loaner car that was not equivalent to what I was driving. Each week the car was promised but not repaired. When I showed dissatisfaction, the service manager hung up the phone. I was angry but not rude. He denied hanging up but why did he not call back? This operation is negligent and inept.

<Review>Efficient and almost quick is the word, the first visit have made me satisfied, I almost gave the last star but I decide not to because while waiting an hour half for the servicing,  I was told my car is ready and waiting for the final wash, I waited almost another 25 mins just for the final wash but nobody came to inform me if it is ready or not. Finally I have to walk up to my supervisor office and ask for my car, at that time my advisor was busy with other customer in her office but I can't wait any longer. She realize it and drove up my car herself. Overall my advisor is good and no other complaints from me.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I recently visited this dealership for the first time last week and I must say this facility is exemplary but the reason I am writing this review is because of the interaction I had with a service advisor, Daniel Gad. Daniel made me feel welcomed and rolled out the red carpet. He gave me the VIP treatment and explained that my vehicle was not yet due for service and thoroughly explained how the vehicle would let me know when it was due for service. His knowledge of these vehicles is remarkable and I know that when I come see Daniel I will not be taken advantage of, which is a feeling that I have felt at other dealerships. I am now a customer for life and can’t wait to schedule my next service. So, if you ever need your car serviced go see Daniel. He is THE BEST!!!< /text>< pictures>

Everything about the service was fine. The new service adviser is great. Your car wash is terrible. You need to make more effort washing the cars. My car came out looking worse. They need to clean inside and do a better job with the outside of the car.<//Review>

<Text>I came to get my car fixed and must say was surprised that I have finally had customer service that deserved a good review. This Calabasas dealership, but more specifically Daniel Gad, had taken such good care of me that I had to write this review. I am used to calling and checking up on my car and hassling dealerships but Daniel did all he could to make sure I had a pleasant experience. I would definitely return here for any problems I may have but even more so I would request service by Daniel Gad! Thank you!!<//Text>< pictures>

Purchased a new car through Calabasas MBZ, a really great experience.  Kudos to them.  The staff was efficient, attentive and very customer oriented.  Jeremy Israel-Tombs was great to work with, paper work was completed quickly and accurately, and I would recommend these folks any day and every day.</text>

This place is great.  I had come in to speak with someone in the service department and I spoke to Daniel Gad.  He was great! He answered all of my questions with full confidence and I left the place completely satisfied.  I would recommend anyone who visits the service department to seek out Daniel and have him help you out.<//Text>

<Text>They ripped me off on my deal. The dealership had a nonsales rep handle my deal. After signing into a new deal they retracted the offer & stuck me with the bill and told me it was my problem. Do not buy your car here this is the second car I bought here with a problem. First one I bought a brand new car and the steering wheel malfunctioned. When I spoke to the gm he told me undoing the sale would be like opening a can of worms so they refused to take my car back on both occasions! I was bullied & then referred to their legal department. I have had 6 benzes never will I ever buy from
This dealership again. Gm Mike is completely unprofessional & seemed on an ego trip. I was completely taken advantage of!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Calabasas Motors' Service Department, under Wes Crown's management delivers platinum quality service. My husband and I have been loyal customers of Mercedes Benz of Calabasas for over 16 years. While we have always enjoyed great customer service, we have experience a higher degree of personal attention and tailored service under Wes. Recently, I experienced a minor glitch in the scheduling which was detected by Wes and resolved immediately by assigning Steve. They expedited the service and arranged for a loaner and, within hours, my CLS 400 was washed and ready to be picked up. Thank you Wes and Steve for continuing to uphold the standard Mercedes Benz demands.< /text>

<review>Always truly exceptional service even above and beyond most Mercedes dealerships. Mira in the service dept handles the influx of calls, appointments, and request with professionalism and genuine care. Kyle has always gone above and beyond to ensure that each time my car has been in service that I am kept updated and know all my options. Then there's the loaner car section. The lady (I am wincing that I have forgotten her name) ALWAYS remembers me. She runs the loaner program like clockwork. That dept wouldn't function without her.< /review>< userid>

<text>Miguel was very helpful to check my car in, got a ride from the courteous driver to work and got a call to get picked up to pick up my car. Everything went smoothly and accordingly, and my car is fixed and washed.

<Text>This is the second car I have purchased in the last two months. One from another dealer and one from Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. My experience at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas was extraordinary.. Sheena and Andrew were EXCELLENT as was James in finance. Aren took care of everything for me, even returning my rental so I didn't need to hassle with that. I have NEVER had such a positive low pressure experience in dealing with any retailer. I should note that I bought a used car that was a quarter the price of their new cars on the lot and they treated me royally. This will be the first place I look for my next car.<//Text>< date>

<Review>I came in to the service department last week with a few questions regarding my S550 and I ran into Daniel Gad who was great! I was impressed with his customer service from the second I walked in till the moment I left. He answered all my questions and put my mind at ease. Calabasas is a bit of a drive for me but it's people like Daniel that make me go the extra mile to have my car serviced! Thank you Daniel!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Purchasing a new car from David Copelle at Calabasas Mercedes was a stress free and excellent buying experience.  He was consistent and very hard working throughout the process of finding me the right car.  I would highly recommend both David and the dealership staff as they were very professional during the car buying process.<//Text>< time>

I live about 25 miles from this dealership. However, my vehicle and I are always treated with the utmost care. Everyone from the sales team to the service team are courteous, knowledgeable and a pleasure to do business with.< /Text>

<review>Such an amazing dealer! As soon as I get there I'm greeted by such friendly staff! Shortly after arriving we meet Amir, so professional and down to earth! Probably the best person to do business with! You tell him what your wanting and he does everything in his power to get it done! He spent his ENTIRE day with us helping us get the best deal and the perfect vehicle! We originally went in to get a used car! Nope, we left in a brand new car! I don't know how he did it but, he did! Like I said he spent his whole day with us, he even offered to take us to lunch while we waited! That is seriously so unheard of especially in such a high end dealer! If it wasn't for Amir I don't think we would have found the perfect car but we did! I will always do business with Mercedes and Amir! I would give them more stars if I could!! He is awesome!!< /review>< Pics>

I bought my E350 Bluetec from Mercedes Benz of Calabasas about two years ago. Ever since I always have a very pleasant service from them. Alon, my service adviser made all the difference. He is very helpful and conscientious. During my last time I brought my car for service because of the engine light warning always lit, he was very proactive in checking that the problem was covered under warranty. His consciousness saved me lots of money. Thank you, Alon.

Overall, Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is an excellent dealership if you ever want to buy a Mercedes Benz.<//review>

Had an appointment and they determined they would need my car for a couples days at least. They didn't have any loaner cars  and they didn't have a connection with any car rental company, so they couldn't offer that as an option. I had no way to get home or get to work while car would be worked on. Had to make another appt asking for guarantee loaner car  available. Disappointed that a luxury car dealership had such poor ability to offer the basic good customer support</review>

I had several issues with my pre-owned car and my sales agent, Sheena took care of them all. She even bought me lunch while my car was being serviced. I thought that was above and beyond. I bought a pre-owned car from a dealer in case there were issues with the vehicle. Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas stood behind their product and got everything fixed. I would also like to give my sales agent, Sheena five stars. She made sure that my experience was a good one. Sheena provided a loaner vehicle while my car issues were being addressed. Her friendly and professional manor were always on display. A real pro. Thanks for everything and I love my car!< /Review>< Date>

Over the course of several weeks, he showed that he was very knowledgeable and demonstrated high motivation and professionalism in helping us find the right car. There was an issue with delivery, but he made it right. Of all the individuals I have worked with in purchasing our various cars, he is head and shoulders above the others.

<Review>I saw a 2008 CLK cab posted online from Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. The posting was so new there wasn't even a picture (it turns out the car was in detailing being made into almost new condition). The same cars with twice the milage were being sold by others at the same price. This car was a one owner, with all servicing up to date. I was there in a few hours (luckily because I wasn't the only one interested) and worked with Alfredo De Leon. It was a cash deal and I didn't get any upsell which was appreciated. I met with Jason McCann, the service manager who is the nicest guy and even though he knew I didn't live near Calabasas and so wouldn't be servicing the car there, explained so much about the car that he really gave me confidence in my purchase. I would definitely trust him with any service on the car if I lived anywhere near this dealership.
Something special that happened was that the detailing was going to take 2 days and my wife and I would pick up the car on Saturday, but a problem with a seam in the cab convertible top delayed pick up until Monday. My wife would be at work on Monday and I didn't want to spring for Uber/Lyft and complained to Alfredo who volunteered to pick me up and drove the 45 minutes each way. That's service, especially on a used car deal! My wife and I are so happy with the car. Thanks Mercedes Benz of Calabasas.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I have dealt with Calabasas Motors over the years for service and parts and now purchased a car from them.  For the first time I purchased one of their cars sight unseen.  The support from Calabasas Motors exceeded my expectations and they went above and beyond to assist me in my purchase.  They were willing to drive the car to me, at the time I was in the Palm Springs area, just to see and drive it with no obligation to purchase.  I did end up buying the car as it was everything they advertised and everything I expected.  They left the new car and drove my other car back to the dealership which I picked up upon returning from my trip.  This is a great dealership to consider when purchasing or servicing a car.</text>

Classy operation, I contacted the General Manager Sean Fortier first because of a negative experience at another local Mercedes store.  Much to my surprise, he took care of the entire transaction for me and leased a new 2014 E350. I got an amazing deal without the haggling and felt like a true VIP through the whole process.  They get my vote for a top-notch dealership!<//Review>

Went through Ana Litovskaya, Fleet Manager, at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas for my last lease. AWESOME customer service by her and her lovely assistant. They were on top of everything from day one. Got a very aggressive deal on my S550 through Ana. Will be referring all of my colleagues to her.  Big thank you to the both of you.<//Review>

Mercedes Benz of Calabasas not only has the best service department but hey are also the most polite and knowledgeable..  I never have to worry that I may not have a rental car waiting for me.  I never have to worry that they car will take longer than anticipated.  In fact most often my car is finished well before I am expecting it. Not only is it running superbly but its always a pleasure to get into a complimentary freshly vacuumed and washed car.  They have the tip top staff! Especially those service advisors.  Great work Mercedes Benz of Calabasas!< /Text>

My wife just got the Mercedes GLC from MB Calabasas. The car is amazing!!!! Sheena , the online sales was out of this world. She was able to get us the exact car we wanted, even though they did not have it in stock and gave the best rate compared to any other dealership.
The GLC has a new look. Amazing technology. Wonderful comfort . We LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
We highly recommend MB Calabasas . Sheena is the one!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

I would like to thank Mr. Andrew Gomez at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. I requested a quote on my new Mercedes Benz. Andrew was the first to respond, of all the other dealers that I requested quotes from. His price was fair so i scheduled an appointment with him to make the purchase. He made our experience at his office very easy. My family and I were in and out in very good time on a busy saturday. I really do appreciate that because we did not want to be there all day. I will send my friends and family to Andrew Gomez at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas.</Text>

<Review>After searching all over LA and Orange county for the best price on the new vehicle I wanted, MB of Calabasas had the best deal and I purchased the car from them.   That was 7 years ago and during that time and trying other dealers for service, I always came back to here. Many people don't realize that the dealerships charge different rates for the same A and B Services.  MB of Calabasas always won the price war and got me back in the door.  When my car was out of the factory warranty,  I bought the extended warranty, along with the pre-paid service for the next 3 years.  At that point I certainly could have gone to any dealer,  but I still made the trek from South Bay to Calabasas because of who they are and the great experience I had always received from them.   At this dealer, they didn't try to upsell me like two others did.   The service managers stayed pretty consistent, they always had an MB loaner ready for me, and every person I came in contact with made me feel important.  From the porter, cashier, loaner car agent, service manager, to the receptionist, they all are always nice, respectful, and have good attitudes. They are thorough with the car and conservative with service recommendations.  I've never had any issues with them, or the car.  This has been the best car I've ever owned and the best care I've ever had at a dealership!  Kudos to the GM of this dealer.  He or she is doing it right!

I'm going to miss them!  Sadly, my warranty and pre-paid maintenance is done and not renewable,  so I'll be finding a good independent service guy now in my neighborhood.   When I'm ready for my next MB, you can bet I'm coming back to MB of Calabasas.   They are the best in LA county hands down and I highly recommend them!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Mercedes Benz Calabasas always takes great care of me.  Alon is the best service advisor, and always is very thorough when explaining what has been done with my vehicle.  Everyone is always very pleasant from the porters who greet you, to the advisors to the driver who brings you back to the dealership!</Text>

<review>Had a new tire placed on my 2015 S550. Cost me $408.00  Everything went well. Jason took good care of me as usual.  It was determined that the tire had a patch that was leaking  air. After thinking about it later, I bought the car new at your dealership and never had a problem or patch put on the tire. When I  bought the car, my salesman ordered it from another dealership. I'm thinking that wherever it was transferred from must have serviced the tire before. My car has less than 11,000 miles on it. It would be nice to receive some kind of relief for this very expensive tire cost. Thank you<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Randomly passed by Mercedes of Calabasas yesterday. A young salesWOMAN Anna helped me pick out a car that best fit my price range. I can't even begin to describe how helpful she was !!!! She made leasing a car look as easy as 1-2-3. Customer service is great, she's very pleasant and easy to deal with. Strongly recommend to see her when thinking of purchasing or leasing a vehicle.< /Text>

I arrived at Calabasas Mercedes via the service department driveway park my car and ask the gentleman wear parts department was and if I was okay where I was parked. Very polite gentleman in the service area. When I found my way to the parts department I rang the bell someone stepped out and said someone would be there momentarily.  After 30 minutes waiting nobody showed up. Several had passed through the area and no one inquired if I was being helped or anyting as they made their way to the service area or towards the sales. I finally was so frustrated I left. I will never go back there to purchase a car, service a car, or even buying my own parts at this establishment ever again!</review>

I've been going to this dealership for the past 8 years! The service department and Manager are a major reason I keep coming back! They deliver quality service with a smile.  Their Customer service training reflects with every employee in the service department.   It's a pleasure to go there.  If there's a problem with your car, they fix it right the first time! I highly recommend them!< /review>

<review>Overall very nice customer service experience by service advisor Scott Gomez and rental car representative Paula. However, somehow my “active curve malfunction” can not be fixed after multiple trips. Tiring and scary whether this is a real threat on the road or just computer malfunction. Would love to get this resolved once and for all.</review></record>

<time>1474004320804</time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>The used car dealer stereotype of dishonesty, lying and general lack of integrity has been skillfully demonstrated by the staff of Calabasas Mercedes-Benz. Last week I placed a down payment on a car found thru their "Sonic" automotive site located at a sister Mercedes-Benz dealer. I was assured that the car was available, no one else had bought or made a down payment and would only take a few days to get here. I proceeded to acquire full funding, made a deal on my existing car and got a rental for the anticipated few days I would need. Monday I received message that the car was no longer available, had a mechanical problem and was sold wholesale. This car was listed with 6011 miles and had just passed a 165 point inspection by a certified MB mechanic. When I requested what the problem was, they didn't know and laughed when I asked what part of the 165 point inspection would have missed an implied major mechanical problem. In addition to casting serious doubt as to the value of a certified inspection, there was serious doubt with respect to the honesty of the failure. After visiting the dealer and lengthy discussion as to the truth, the sales manager finally admitted that there was no mechanical issue and the car was sold to someone else retail and that there is an integrity issue within their dealerships, REALLY! I discussed at length the impact that these dishonest dealings have on people, was just not expecting this kind of low level dealing at a Mercedes dealer. They have absolutely no respect or care about their customers what so ever.
Should have read some of their other reviews before I went to buy from them.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I recently purchased a Mercedes from a used car lot and I was unfamiliar with the various functions of the vehicle so I brought my car into the dealer on a Saturday where Daniel Gad greeted me with a smile when I pulled in. The first thing I noticed was how beautiful the dealership was but it was my interaction with Daniel that made me a customer of this fine establishment for as long as I own a Mercedes. His knowledge of the vehicle and his patience with me as he showed me the functions of my vehicle makes him an asset to not only this company but the brand. What truly sets Daniel apart is that he makes you feel like family rather than just another customer. If you ever need your vehicle serviced go see Daniel Gad. I promise you won’t regret it!</text>< pictures>

IF I COULD GIVE THIS PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A DEALERSHIP ZERO STARS, I WOULD. They are the WORST DEALERSHIP EVER!!!!!!! Do NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! They are extremely unprofessional, they'll say anything to get a sale out of you! And once they sell you the car, good luck getting ANY decent customer service. AGAIN DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I have never been so unimpressed with a car company. My boyfriend was ready to buy a car and they asked him to wait an hour. He goes to get dinner and comes back and they still want him to wait. When he said he cannot wait any longer, they laughed behind his back and was acting all self-entitled. They could care less that they are losing business. They were also bragging about being busy when they had zero customers. I do not recommend their service.<//text>< Rate>

<user_name>JOSE RUBEN AGUILAR</user_name><date>1438375445207</date><rating>1< /rating><Text>It has been one of the most disappointing experiences in my life! We went this morning with the idea of picking up a car that we were already contracted over the phone the afternoon before, we road tested, agreed on the detailed price in front of us, filled up the paperwork, ready to pay cash and a few minutes before the contract was signed a person from finances came to say "how are you paying?" we responded: with a Credit Union check. He left and a few minutes later came back saying  "sorry, the car was already contracted to someone else for $400 more" and "we understand how you feel, sorry" The explanations were vague and kept repeating "sorry, we understand how you feel" when asked why we were not told that when we arrived 2 hours before, the financial officer just kept repeating the same thing and said that they could back off on the deal they had made to us.
I NEVER in my life thought that a MERCEDES -BENZ  IN CALABAZAS wouldn't keep their word and will do such a dirty trick!!</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>I went in to check out a few cars on the lot and I had some questions about the service provided at the shop in the event my car needed it. I met with a really nice gentleman named Daniel Gad and he put my mind at ease and answered all of my questions. I had a negative experience with a Mercedes service department (In Utah) and vowed never to lease a car through Mercedes ever again but Daniel helped me change my mind. Honestly, if he were to move dealership service locations, I'd follow him to make sure my lease was taken care of. I manage a team of sales and customer service agents for a living and it takes a lot to make me say "wow" and Daniel did just that. I am a very happy potential customer :)</text>< name>

<Review>Big shout out to Nick Argos at MB Calabasas for making buying a new car a joy.  Incredibly knowledgeable about the vehicle Nick traded my old car and put us in an amazing E400 wagon all in the space of one afternoon.  Couldn't have been easier.  We had done our financial homework and received a discounted price from another dealer and were very happy that Nick's numbers matched that and he sweetened the deal on the trade in.   And always reassuring when you are under the number on the MB payment estimator! No haggling, no hassle.  Xavier made the financial signing work a breeze.  All in all a great experience.  Highly recommend Nick and Xavier.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas has a phenomenal service staff and management that goes above and beyond to make certain you are taken care of. More specifically,  Kyle Wiens (Service Advisor) was world class in terms of professionalism and customer care. Seriously... don't bother going anywhere else but here, as I have had service done at most of the regional Mercedes dealerships and this one is absolutely the best!< /Text>

Jeremy was amazing. We did the entire transaction through the internet and the car was delivered to my home and exchanged for the return lease. I have used MBZ Calabasas for over a decade even though I live 30 miles away and there are closer MBZ dealerships in my community.</Text>

I normally never take my car into dealerships because I prefer to do my own maintenance but after speaking to Dan Gad in the service department I felt super comfortable leaving my car for a warranty issue. Everything was done on time and the customer service was fantastic. Way to go mbz Calabasas and thanks again Dan!<//Review>

Jenna worked with me on my CLA deal and she quickly gave me a reasonable numbers while I was able to negotiated without much hustle, she's reasonable and bringing honesty on the table which is rare in this kind of business, took us both not even 20 minutes to agreed on the purchase of my car thus this was the fastest&smoothest negotiation I ever done and I've been dealing with over 30 MB Dealers all over the states.

Gives some credit to David whom I believe is the guy allowing this to happen also Elliott whom worked on my papers and put up with my questions regarding documents !

I would recommend anyone talking to Jenna if you're looking for a car, I'm not saying you'll get the best price or a lot of discount but talk to her and you'll see why it's worth your time.< /Review>

< Review>
I was paying cash (certified check) for a car and specifically asked that they not do a hard credit pull on my credit file. The salesman assured me that they would not.

I got home and found that they conducted a hard pull which made my credit score (800+) go down. Why did they do hard credit pull when for all intents and purposes I was paying cash???

When I complained, they promised me that they would investigate and get back to me. Six days later and it has been nothing but silence. No response from anyone.</Review>

I had the most wonderful experience at Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas. Arsalan Kuchikali was professional and kind and treated me with respect. He is knowledgeable, experienced, and very easy going. And he picked me up to take me to the dealership to pick up my car - very nice. There were no games or hard sales pitches. He guided me through the auto purchase experience and handled every detail. Wonderful!< /review>

My experience with the dealership was mostly all positive. The facilities were clean, well organized and the cars were nicely displayed. My salesman was knowledgeable in regards to the features on the car. We had a minor misunderstanding in terms of my readiness to do a deal; however, I returned a second time and I got a great deal. Additionally, the salesman was extremely patient in locating the exact car in terms of color and options on the car. He found it at another dealership and had to have the car shipped to the local dealership. I did have a pre-approval for loan and at the financial close-out, I was able to improve my deal. now, I have everything that I wanted in a long term car. From my perspective, the safety features, comfort features and the ride along with an extended warranty and pre-paid maintenance were all selling points. I would rate my experience as four and one-half stars.</text>

I brought my car in because I was having a problem with the AC, which would release this awful, vinegary odor whenever the car was turned on, even when the AC hadn’t been used previously. My car is still under warranty, and I hadn’t done anything to the car to cause this. This has been an ongoing problem, and I’ve brought my car in before. Benz has yet to solve the issue.

I was told that it was a “maintenance issue,” so they couldn’t do anything about it because it wasn’t covered under warranty. When asked if the smell were physically harmful, they insisted it wasn’t and claimed it wasn’t caused by a fungus.

I still have to live with this smell, despite numerous attempts to get it fixed. Benz is aware of the issue as well as it is undergoing a class action for it.< /review>

I got my Mercedes at Mercedes Benz of Calabassas, They were more than helpful and I got a great deal. My sales person was David Koeppel who was really nice and helpful and very supportive. I personally recommend him to any one who wants to lease or buy a Mercedes.< /text>

Our second visit to see David Koeppel to lease a Mercedes. As usual he was extremely helpful and attentive to our needs. The first car we got in December 2014 was a CLA250. This time we were introduced to the C300 and loved it. We leased the car. Thank you David for being extremely professional and looking after us like we were royalty! I recommend David and Mercedes Benz of Calabasas to anyone looking for a new Mercedes or any Mercedes!<//Review>

First off let me begin by saying the service was impeccable. It began with my Sales Representative Nick Argos. Nick greeted me and my friend immediately upon arriving to the dealership. Unfortunately, by the time I got there the vehicle I came to test drive and purchase was in the process of being sold. I was devastated and Nick could see it on my face.

He led us to his desk and explained I did not have to worry because Sonic Automotive Mercedes had multiple dealerships and I could select a vehicle from any of their dealerships to have it shipped down. This gave me hope because Mercedes Benz of Calabasas is one of the smaller Mercedes dealerships I have visited and I knew they did not have a similar model to the vehicle I came to purchase.

Within a matter of minutes Nick identified a newer, lower mileage vehicle that was only $5,000 more than the one I came for. It was practically new, 2015, 6,000 miles, C250 Coupe; I was in car love!! <3

Nick ordered the car to be delivered to Mercedes Benz of Calabasas immediately. He provided me with his mobile number and promised me he would keep me updated on the vehicles status. Nick stayed true to his word, he called and text me with each update he received. He even texted me pictures of the vehicle when it finally arrived, which was a few days later.

I came in the following weekend to purchase the vehicle and Nick had it ready for me in the showing room. The vehicle was squeaky clean, filled with gas, and had a note on the window reading "Congratulations on your new Mercedes Benz Amanda!" Everything was so perfect but then it came down to doing business.

Nick introduced me to Mehrad Navid their Financial Director. Mehrad was very kind, fast, and he listened. He asked me what I needed my payments to be and worked with me to get them where I was comfortable. At the end of it he provided me the lowest APR Mercedes could offer me, GAP, extended unlimited mileage warranty, and 2 years unlimited maintenance at an affordable monthly payment. I walked away with a newer vehicle with a unique Keyless Go feature (keyless entry and push to start) and better deal than my original Mercedes and the monthly payment were only slightly higher but definitely in my price range.

I drove away ecstatic! The only thing that could have been better was traffic. Exactly a week later Nick followed up with me to ensure I was still satisfied with my purchase. I am and I sincerely appreciate Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. I recommend visiting this dealership if you are seeking exceptional customer service and top quality Certified Preowned Mercedes Benzes.</Text>

She and her assistant went above n beyond to get me exactly wat I wanted. Unlike other dealerships I've been to Calabasas Benz was very welcoming and professional. Finance went smoothly. And they were able to spend some time with me going over the entire car. I am super pleased and Anna was just wonderful.

< review>
I took my car in for service last week and could not have had a better experience. My car had become dangerous to drive, but the fix was no longer covered by manufacturer warranty. Understanding that the issue made for a dangerous situation, my service provider Kyle Wiens, worked with me to find a solution that worked both with the coverage and the repair that needed to be made. He went above and beyond by finding additional service items that needed attention and fixed those along with my original concerns in a timely manner. He had the car fixed, washed and back to me by the time I needed it for a previously scheduled appointment. He and the team at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas provided the kind of service that I expect out of luxury manufacturer and it will certainly keep me coming back. I would recommend this location to any friend of mine needing service.< /review>

I have been here about 4 times while looking for a new model. Never once did they actually take me seriously. To guess why is only conjecture but it always just came off snooty. Sad when I need to go to Encino to find grounded people.</Review>

< Review>
This review is from Ted Boock, whose car was serviced. Jason McCann, the service manager, worked with me on the replacement of my run flat tires, making suggestions and recommendations. He set up an early appointment for me on a Saturday, scheduled the installation of the tires, the balancing and the alignment of the wheels. With a car wash everything was done in 21/2 hours. Jason then explained everything that had been done. I am always completely satisfied with Jason's help and the service department is worth every bit of the 5 stars I reviewed it with. The service department has been a major factor in the numerous cars my family has bought/leased cars at MBZ of Calabasas.<//Review>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>We took our 2013 Mercedes Benz G63 to Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas to  have a few problems fixed and I have to say my experience was not a pleasant one . The first individual at Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas I dealt with was my service  representative , Eddie Aquino.  I told Eddie about the problems associated with my vehicle  and he assured me they would look at them and try to replicate them(They can be seen below).

- Right light that shakes violently once you reach 60 miles per hour.
- Loud clicking sound from the right rear wheel barring when you accelerate from stand still.
- Violent wheel shaking  on the highway when you change lanes

The next day Eddie called me and told me my car was ready... I went back and they hadn't done anything...  Since they couldn't replicate the problems and didn't bother  driving the car at night to check the headlight.

I had my father( has ran his own mechanic shop for 30 years)  head down to the dealership to help replicate the problems in a drive a long with the technician. The technician saw the problems and noted them. They asked for authorization to drive the vehicle at night to see if the headlight really did shake. We  gave them permission to do so and left.

At this time our warranty was on the verge of expiring and they ended up keeping the car about  8-9 days and at that point the warranty expired. When we went to pick it up they fixed all the problems ,but DIDN'T BOTHER TO DRIVE THE CAR AT NIGHT TO SEE JUST HOW BAD THE HEADLIGHT SHAKES.

The service lane manager Jason McCann was extremely rude and admitted they never drove the car at night even thought they asked and received  permission to do so. They did put on the 50 miles in driving , but they didn't bother checking the headlight shaking at night.

We ended up speaking with the service director Roger Ullen. At first he seem to be more understanding about the whole situation. He told us we could schedule a time to do a night time drive along and if it did shake he would have it fixed. We expressed concern that if the moment we drove off the premise there was no guarantee Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas would honor it's word so we asked to get it in writing.

Roger told us he couldn't give us anything in writing as it would be considered an extension of our warranty which he could not legally do... He told us Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas had to fix the problem because we brought it in before the warranty expired so we shouldn't worry.

We decided to take his word  and a few days later we scheduled a time for Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas to send roadside assistance at night to visually see the problem. Sure enough the technician saw the headlight shaking. He gave us his report noting the shaking in the headlight and even noted that  some of the original problems STILL EXISTED EVEN THOUGH THEY REPAIRED THEM....

We called Roger the next day to have our headlight changed. Roger told us Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas wouldn't change the headlight despite everything he  told us..

Overall my experience with Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas was a terrible one. If you do decide to deal with them I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING AS I WAS DECEIVED!!!!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Ryan was amazing. Helped me get a loaner when there wasn't one available at first. Went over the car completely and fix everything and asked about things that weren't covered. No pressure to upsell. Best experience ever at a service place.
******
Well that’s all changed! Ryan is long gone and the new group screwed me over big time. I called to bring my car in and they couldn’t get me in until the following week. Then I went in and they told me my warranty expired the week before. I opened a case with Customer Care to try to get covered since I was covered when I first tried to go in. They said I had to bring it in for diagnostics first, which I thought sounded shady, since the problem with my car should have nothing to do with my being covered or not, but I did as they asked and brought it in.
They said it needed $2900 worth of work, AND that they had decided I wasn’t covered.
I said I wanted my car back and they tried to charge me $200 for the diagnostic.
Angel eventually gave me my car without charging me, but the lack of accountability from everyone was astounding. The dealer says they have no control over the warranty people, and the warranty people have no control over the dealership. So guess who gets screwed in the end! The customer.
I took it to my usual mechanics at White Oak Mercedes in Tarzana and Mike and Larry fixed my car for $600!
Mercedes of Calabasas are a bunch of money hungry thieves in my humble opinion, and I’ll never deal with them again.
Paula in the courtesy vehicle department is the best employee they have. She helped me get my car through Angel so I didn’t have to pay $200 to find out they weren’t going to honor my warranty.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

My wife and I purchased an ML 350 from this dealership. I would have to say it was a good experience, one made much easier by our sales associate Veron Wilkins, who looked after us all the way through the process including after we had our new vehicle. Highly recommend this dealership.< /text>

Very Disappointed! I don’t know what other customers experience but I definitely was not satisfied with their customer service. Instead of helping me they told me to go to another dealership  I actually left Mercedes of Calabassas with a friend and purchased a brand new 2018 Benz at Mercedes-Benz of Keyes. It goes to show you that Everything that glitters is not gold I strongly advice customer to do their research before purchasing from Mercedes-Benz of Calabassas</text>

These people are scam artists. They take in previously leased cars, patch up visible damage, certify them, and sell them to the public.

We purchased a certified pre-owned vehicle, took it home, 2 days later we noticed three small holes in the windshield that appeared to be made by a tool. We immediately called the dealership and received no assistance.

We brought the car in, the manager Jose Leyva accused me of causing the damage myself (ie. rock hitting windshield, vandalism). They treated us like criminals, although, they reluctantly agreed to fix the glass but with the attitude that we should be grateful to them.

Now, when the windshield repair company saw the glass, they reported that the windshield, “could not be repaired because it has already been fix by someone else and the holes were made by a drill in the process of a previous repair.” After speaking with many credible people (other Mercedes dealership employees, the windshield repair technician, and an attorney) it seems that the dealership knew about the original damage, repaired the glass, stamped the car as “certified” and sold it to us.   NOTE: When a vehicle is certified pre-owned, the glass is supposed to be the original glass without damage.

After the report by the windshield repair company they sent a new windshield which was fine, however, had it not been for the this one HONEST man (windshield repair technician), we would have been stuck with a broken windshield on a newly purchased vehicle.

The entire process took months. It was frustrating and a complete battle. I was forced to hire an attorney to support me through this unjust situation. I will never again associate with this dealership and hope that this review helps people to be cautious<//Text>

My most serious problem with the car is one that I’m still being told cannot be duplicated. The team in service talks to me as though there is absolutely nothing wrong with my car. It’s a horrible feeling and experience, especially given that the malfunctioning my car is experiencing puts our lives in danger. I have two children and driving my car with them in it makes me nervous like only a parent can understand. I drive a large, expensive truck and I’m only offered their smallest, cheapest cars as loaners, while I know they have their better cars available. Every time I pick up my car from the service department I’m treated like I’ve wasted there time. Meanwhile I’m paying over $1,500 for a Mercedes that shuts down while I’m in Drive.<//Review>< pictures>

My wife and i had visited several car dealers in the Los Angeles area searching for a Mercedes GLK 350. While visiting Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas we met Nick Argos one of the sales reps who was very trustworthy and really worked to earn our business. Through Nick's hard work and also the staff in the finance department we were able to purchase the GLK 350 at a great price and are completely satisfied with our new vehicle.< /review>

The experience I had coming to Mercedes of Calabasas and buying my new C63 was by far the best experience ive ever had buying a new car, the staff were all great and my sales girl Anna was over the top as far as customer service and making me feel special, the finance guys were also super fast and got me in and out in a flash, see you next time when my lease is up, I wouldn't go anywhere else A++++<//Text>

<text>I have an 83 Mercedes 300CD with a Turbo diesel engine and the thing always breaks down. I brought it in to MBC, and Daniel Gad was ready to help me with any questions I had. There was a problem with the vacuum system and Daniel explained that old diesels can be a little harder to work with. He explained an open line anywhere in the car can compromise the entire transmission, so he suggested to replace all the rubber vacuum connectors just to be safe. That did the trick! Thanks Daniel!</text><username>Chris Pigozzi<//username><UserId.>114819858047516959358<//UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

About 2 or so months ago I leased a new E400 convertible from Anna Litovskaya at Mercedes of Calabasas. Just needed to give a huge shout out to her and her team over there. From the moment I spoke with her on the phone, to the moment her assistant dropped off my car it was nothing but enjoyable and by far the easiest transaction I have ever had at a dealership. Anna is very profesional and honest. She gave me a killer deal and I will be sure to be coming back to Mercedes of Calabasas when my lease is up. Happy have been referred to her.< /review>

<user_name>Kerri Randles</user_name><text>Okay, I don't think I've ever had a better experience buying a car. If you are thinking of buying or leasing a Mercedes Benz, I don't care how far away you live from Calabasas, California... it's worth the trip!! Mark Matias and Andrew Wallop guided me through the most pleasant experience, dealing with my trade-in, a recently challenged credit score, and the reality of buying a car in a depressed market. Honestly, they could have sold me a KIA and I would have bought it. The lesson here is: NEVER SETTLE.

After test-driving the E-Class and C-Class, they did their best to get me into the E-Class, a step up, when the C-Class ended up being just fine for me. There was never the typical detached vibe of a car salesman. These men were more than car salesmen. They were men who have lived lives and have momentarily graced Mercedes Benz with their presence. No doubt, more cars have sold at this location since they arrived. After several hours, and lunch on them, never any nervousness that the transaction wouldn't go through... They made me the proud driver of my first Mercedes on that balmy, hot day in the Valley. It actually drizzled on my way home, and they offered to re-detail the car for me a few days later...

I actually had separation anxiety driving away from the place, and look forward to going back for the detail, just to say 'hello'!!! The real reason I'm writing this though is that we live in a world of instant gratification and immediacy. Celebrity and status. It gets rarer that someone on the street looks you in the eyes. The common thread that connects us all has been broken. We are all disconnected. Especially in the pursuit of money, things, and ironically happiness. It's the little things though, like these kind of interactions, that give us hope in humanity again.

Signed, a VERY satisfied patron, driver, and human being.

A non aggressive yet a knowledgeable sales professional, an attentive listener who's pro active in accomplishing all your automotive needs and request.

Andrew and David in Finance Department who alleviated all the back and forth haggling nonsense, creatively and expediently was able to get my wife and I in and out of there in a timely manner yesterday January 28th, 2017.

Thomas and Angel, 2 of the Manager's at Calabasas Mercedes  manages and oversees the Calabasas Mercedes Sales Team and Servicing Departments. They are the catalyst of Calabasas Mercedes Sales Team's Excellence that's second to none.

Marcus Simpson, We appreciate our pleasant and professional auto buying experience with you.

I was assisted by another salesman, Chris Yadager and was blown away!  He was so amazing and  professional.  He called me when my part came in and set up an appointment with an advisor for me.

Sheena Farentino at MBZ of Calabasas is by far, the best car salesperson I’ve ever worked with. Her energy, knowledge, advice, warmth and follow through makes the car buying experience an absolute pleasure. I loved working with her so much that I bought my car on a Monday and took my parents to buy a GLC 300 from her that Saturday.</text>

Hello
We are a Mercedes-Benz car owners and customers, In the pass few month we find our self looking for the right deal and the right dealer, Few days ago we enter first time to Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas, In front door we greeted by a nice salesmen by the name of Jeff Pierson, From the moment we start talking to him we felt that this salesmen are different from all the Rest of the salesmen’s that we meet in the past. Jeff was really exceptional and did not try push us see a car or to buy a car, first and four most He is very knowledgeable on every car and detail question that me and my wife had. Never in any time has he asked us “if this is your car today?” or “do you see yourself driving this car today?” We didn’t buy a car on this day, but something was very special about Jeff,                                                         We looked in the internet and we find a car that we really like, I called Mr. Jeff and had a nice Conversation with him about the car that I see and desired, unfortunately they didn’t have this car on There lot.  Jeff told me that he will keep an eye and let me know if he can find it in a different dealer. Again didn’t try to convince me to buy something else or change my mind. Few days later I couldn’t believe but Jeff Pierson was on the other line of the phone telling me that He find that car that we were looking for and he told me approximately what is the monthly Payment will be and ask me if I want to know more details about the car, I answer that I do want to Know more detail and he told me that don’t need to come over to the dealer he will look in to it and call me back. It was so nice of him not to drag me and my wife to the dealer for no reason, a day later Jeff Pierson a call me and give me all the info that I want to know and we decided to meet next day in the dealer show room.                                                                                                             A day after me and my wife meet Jeff Pierson in his office, and to make the story short, we got the deal that we want and the car that we looked for.   We really want to thank Mr. Jeff Pierson from our bottom of our heart. Jeff he is real assets for Mercedes-Benzes of Calabasas, Jeff made it so easy and comfortable for me and my wife.  We also got to meet the general manager Mike Franz and Danielle Knudson (Client Relations Manager)   they was so nice to us and appreciate our business.  Today after that we had the car for couple of day we decided to write this letter to show our appreciations to all of the wonderful people in Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas
Thank you so much

Good experience here at Mercedes calabasas. Went there to help my girl friend find a car. We looked online and was contacted by Veron the Internet guy. He was nice and spent a lot of time with us to make sure she got the right car. No pressure at all and it was simple. Thanks again guys for all the help :)<//Review>

Was introduced to Anna through a broker and has an awesome experience. She was so polite over the phone and easy to work with. She was able to get me to the price I wanted to be on our new C-300. And on top of it, when my wife and I were unable to make our apt to pick up the car she set it up to be delivered to our house. My wife and I were so pleased with everything. Anna was not only friendly and professional, but true to her word. Def something you dont see to often in the car industry. I will be sending a few people her way and knnow they will be in great hands.< /review>

<resp>None</resp><username>Keith Samples< /username><Review>If I could rate lower than one star I would. I bought a used car for my son at this dealership and the water pump went out the next day... even though the car had supposedly gone through a "rigorous" inspection. I went back to the dealer and they agreed to reimburse $300 of the repair if I had the repair done at my independent mechanic and brought them a receipt. Sounded good/fair, except actually getting the $300 has now become more irritating than the water pump going bad in the first place. Despite personally taking an original copy of the repair receipt to the used car manager as instructed more than three weeks ago, there now is no record of the receipt and no check for $300.  During my THIRD trip to this place today, they once again said they needed a receipt to start the process over again. You might ask why I went there personally three times instead of calling. You try calling this place and you will soon know. I now believe they never intended to reimburse for the repair. They just assumed I would forget about it since it's only $300 at a Mercedes dealership. Which is probably what I would have done if I hadn't become convinced it was all just a scam. I've spent more time standing in the lobby of this dealership waiting on someone to actually give me an answer than it took for my mechanic to put in a new water pump... at half the price quoted at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. I shopped for a new car at this dealership a little more than a year ago and walked away because it was just too chaotic and disorganized. My bad for having a short memory. If you are in the market for a Mercedes, it's well worth the drive to Santa Monica.<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Having explored a variety of makes and models (BMW, Audi, Volvo) I kept coming back to Mercedes-Benz and the GLC 300 (black inside & out). I selected Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas through my State Farm agent, who knew the site and the folks there. I was introduced to Ms. Anna Litovskaya who handled my purchase with grace and patience, as I had not bought a car in decades ... literally (1979!). Ms. Marianna Karapetian took me on the road and walked me thru all the features both inside and out, and helped me set up the MB online and phone features. Mr. David Amby took me thru all the paperwork, again with much patience, at the tail end of a very busy Saturday afternoon. I was able to see their impeccable service facilities, was greeted by other folks in the showroom, and in the end got the automobile I really wanted all along. I've never been so calm throughout a transaction, and that speaks a great deal about how these folks handle their business, treat their customers, and do the Mercedes-Benz name a great service. Driving is a pleasure! Thank You Calabasas ... I'm working on getting my friends and family into some new wheels.<//text>

Unprofessionalism at its best! Three hours wasted for nothing!
We booked a test drive for a used CLK convertible which was advertised with all the details you need. They send us an e-mail confirmation and even called us the night before to confirm our appointment, so after work we made our way through the rush hour to Calabasas, which took us more than an hour to get there. When we arrived at 7:00pm (punctually!), our contact person was not available. We had to wait for 10 minutes until actually someone started to deal with us. Unfortunately, that person had no idea where the car was. We were referred to another staff member who had no idea either and started to chase us through all three levels of the entire parking lot in order to look for the car which, in the end, was still not to be found. That guy checked with another colleague who made a phone call and found out that the car is actually in the shop, which was already locked and nobody knew where the key was. We were asked to take a seat at a rep’s desk where a cup of coffee obviously was lying for quite a while and the spilled coffee was all over the desk.
The man tried to find out how to get into the shop and another guy came back after a while. He finally told us that they decided not to sell the car because obviously it was so broken (no word about that in the ad and no hint in the pricing either!!) that it would cost them too much to fix it.
Although quite upset, we gave them a second chance by specifying what we are looking for. The research took quite a while and yet another member of staff took us to the parking lot. None of the cars he showed us met more than one of the four criteria we specified (if you ask for a convertible, you don’t want to be shown non-convertibles, right?!).
Of course, all of them apologized, but we weren’t even offered a reimbursement on the fuel we wasted, not to mention our evening which has had it.
TO SUM IT UP: 1:15h drive to Calabasas + 50 min chaos at the dealer + 1:05h to drive back home = 3:10h WASTED. Thanks for nothing, Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas!<//Review>

<Review>I had a great experience!  Elliot Mossayi was terrific!  He was helpful and knowledgeable without being pushy.  Elliot was very knowledgeable about the company and the process.  Once the car was ready to go, Elliot even helped connect my phone/bluetooth.

I had to wait a little while, while the customer ahead of me completed his financing.  However, everyone I encountered was very friendly, offered water and apologized for the delay.  David Ambry in Finance was also great.  He gave me the info I needed and kept things moving along.  He worked with me to get great financing and an extended warranty for a lower price than initially quoted!  Win/win!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Took MBC250 to Calabasas MB to fix the emergency brake and afterwards the very next day it would not release. Contacting MB they wanted me to drive back to the dealer which I said "No, the emergency brace is locked and I would wear out my brakes if I had to drive the 8 miles to the dealers!"
They asked they "could have the car towed" and I said "No not going to do that either it should have been fixed correctly the first time like they said it was an easy fix!"
They finally sent someone out to the house who released the break said "the spring was weak and would order a new part"
That was two weeks ago, no word from anyone that the part was available . The car is being driven without the use of the emergency brake.< /Text>

As an update:

After this review was written, I was contacted by the Service Director Angel and the Service Lane Manager Jason. They both heard me out and vowed to figure out a way to fix the situation. They were prompt and got back to me the same day and were able to pull some strings in order to find a way to cover all of the costs of the repair.

I appreciate the collaboration the two of them did and fought for the correction of this problem.

Thank you for both of your help! You guys are awesome.

Original Post -

Avoid at all cost!!
I had a recent "Lane assist inoperative" warning on my dash and brought the car to get it checked out. To recap - the car was bought from Mercedes Benz of Calabasas as Certified Pre-own and is still under warranty. Called and made an appointment and the receptionist advised there may be a charge for diagnostic charges just in case if the car was in accident that warranty would not cover the charges. My car has never been in any accident so I took the car in. After the diagnostic test, they noted that heating element in the windshield was defective and the ENTIRE windshield needs to be replace and to top it off, that CPO warranty does not cover the windshield. They said that I need to pay the $180 diagnostic fee and on top of that it's $2,200 to replace the entire windshield as the heating element is not a part that can be replaced.

I was infuriated. I spoke to the service representative (Ryan Collins) who said that their salesman don't explain the CPO coverages well and this isn't the first time this issue has happened. Is that a joke? For customers that pay a premium to buy a car from this place to have the peace of mind of having coverage you don't think that you should explain this situation to them? Really?

I got my car back and called corporate. Corporate said that after their investigation they will cover the parts to fix this ordeal but labor is under the discretion of the dealership. Ryan called me back and quoted by a 5.5 hr job and a quote of $1,000 + for the install. Forget Non-Mercedes glass companies that charge $400 to $500 for the entire job, I have the parts covered and they still want to charge me $1000 plus to install. As spectacle as I was, I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to them but I called Mercedes Benz of Encino and their service dept. said the labor would actually be 2.5 to 3.0 hrs and quoted me $450 for the installation. As a customer of the Calabasas dealership and a patron of getting my car service at this location, I feel that my trust has been taken advantage of throughout this entire car process from purchase to now repair.

I was told that it is best to get a hold of the service manager through email but again have yet to hear back. Like I said before, stay away from this place.< /text>

<text>Visited to test drive the Mercedes-Benz GLC  which I'm considering for our next family car.
Great drive and very pleased with David Keopel, the sales person.  Knowledgeable, friendly, enthusiastic and attentive.
Far above the usual feeling at auto dealers I've visited.</text>< pictures>

Mercedes Benz of Calabasas always exceeds my expectations when it comes to vehicle servicing.  My service adviser Kyle and his team are professional and courteous, my car is ready when promised and cleaned when I pick it up, I would recommend anyone looking to be satisfied totally with their service advisers, please consider visiting Calabasas Mercedes Benz.< /text>

You would think if you bought a $100k benz they would wash your car after service but they don’t. And then they nickle me for $4 to replace the battery on my key fob that keeps dying. They’re awfully penny wise pound foolish. Horrible service. The porters are lazy and have no respect. Never coming back here. Think they’re part of Sonic Group - not surprised by the terrible service. Sonic is notorious for bad dealerships.</review><Date>1513463345166< /Date></record>

My service advisor, Jason, is wonderful!  I come from my home in Bozeman, Montana, to Calabasa, because of Jason and the service I receive there.  Jason answers all my questions, whether about my car, my loaner vehicle or about the new features coming on the 2017 cars.  I could not be any more pleased with the service!< /text>

And they called, emailed and texted me when it was done.  The problem was that when I responded to each and asked for a particular pick-up time for their shuttle, no one ever responded.  I also left several messages for my service person.  She never called back.  And it was literally IMPOSSIBLE to talk to an actual human in the service department.  I had to walk 3 miles to the dealership to pick up my car.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>I have an E class that i purchased in the city but now that i live in the valley i come here for all my servicing needs. I have to say I'm VERY impressed with their professionalism and how personable they can remain while giving proper customer service. I know we all have been somewhere where you take it in for one thing and it feels like youre back for another in two days for something else- this place breaks that chain! every time i leave MBZ Calabasas i feel relief that i wont be back (if i can help it) until i HAVE to.< /review><user_id>116468198196086420527</user_id>< gmap_id>

The two sales consultants that helped me were David Koeppel and Elliot Mossayi. I also met the sales manager, Dominic, and he was very nice and willing to help.

David did a lot of work to help me get down to the price that I needed, and he had great customer service skills. He really seemed genuine and like he wanted to help me, not just get my business or the sale.

On the day that I bought the car, Elliot was extremely helpful in getting everything together and ready to go. Not only that, but even after I had already bought the car, Elliot helped me tremendously with all the questions that I had and with helping me making additional changes to the car. He was responsive and attentive even after he offered his service. I would recommend him as a great salesperson to everyone.

I glad to say that I am impressed with the Mercedes Benz of Calabasas.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I was dealing with Jenna online and was persuaded by a false sense to come down to the Dealership. When I arrived I was pawned off to a salesman instead of dealing with the internet saleswoman (Jenna) I was then low balled with my trade in and high balled with the car in question. The facility is good but they have high prices and low trade in offers. I have NO INTENTIONS to deal with this place in the future. Please be warned they will low ball your trade in and WILL NOT budge on the high prices of their cars. Your best bet is to go to the Valencia Mercedes-Benz Dealership and completely by-pass this place. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!< /text>

<Review>I love the no nonsense with this place, i emails and stated i am looking into purchasing a new car, i don't like to go back and forth, give me your best price, and if it is good we have a deal, if not then we don't, its really as simple as that, both Corwin and Veron took really good care, not only did they come back with an amazing price, (by the way, i do allot of research so i know the cost and options added) they delivered the car in perfect spotless condition, this is my dealership, when i am ready to purchase again, Also, i live in Newport Beach, they even said we will deliver the car to you, you don't need to come all the way down here, this is how car buying should be.

I was shown a vehicle, signed contract and then i received a call by sales manager telling me that the deal was off.  He basically told me that I was a suspect to ship the vehicle out of the country.  Because I was financing the vehicle with my own bank.  They saw a Hispanic name on the contract and automatically assumed the worst. When I made the deal,  I provided them with everything.  Until now a week later i haven't seen my deposit back and a straight answer from them.  I have own BMW since 2003 and I am so sorry to have tried to switch to Mercedes Benz.  I guess if you have a foreign name,  you need to prove Mercedes that you are wealthy enough to buy their vehicles.  I guess you need to be prepared to show them bank statements, w2 forms to show them that you can afford a piece of crap Mercedes. Going back to BMW to buy my new vehicle.<//review><user_id>103448609741895868062< /user_id>< username>

I drive completely out of my way to have my car serviced at Calabasas as their representatives are honest and their automotive technicians are extremely knowledgeable and talented (they were able to diagnose and fix issues with my GL that Keyes Van Nuys could or would not).
Eddie has been my Service Advisor and has always been personable and provides exceptional customer service.
When it’s time to purchase a new vehicle, Mercedes of Calabasas is my first stop.</review>< user>

<Text>Found the vehicle we wanted online and sent an email through the website at 4:30pm. I did nit get a call back for over 12 hours. Was told it was still available and by dumb luck when we went to leave to see it. The exact car was parked in our neighbors driveway with Calabasas Mercedes paper plates.
We called back to confirm it was still available  and was told it was sold last night at 8:30pm. Four hours after we had emailed to cone see it. Niw we have to see it (by dumb luck) in our neighbors driveway every day.
Thank you for not responding to your used inventory emails for those of us who shop that way.< /Text>< pictures>

These guys are FRAUDS!
Go ahead and Google: Auto loan payment packing. This is what THEY do!

Walked in the other night hoping to close a deal. I had spoken to their sales manager, Sunil, previously and we agreed to financing terms which WERE NOT HONORED. The sales manager, Sunil, had run my credit, presented me the terms and the following day when I come back to close the deal, the guy in finance, Sang, is telling me terms that DO NOT match what their sales manager Sunil presented me AFTER they had already ran my credit the previous night.

It seems they had some miscommunication as the interest rate their sales manager presented me was HIGHER than the one I saw in finance despite my credit ALREADY being ran. Once I was in finance, Sang gives me the LOWER interest rate, gives no mention of the original HIGHER rate Sunil had presented me and continues to tell me my payments will be still be HIGHER despite the new LOWER interest rate and the rest of the deal's terms being IDENTICAL.

It's clear that these guys attempted to close me on a HIGHER interest rate regardless of what the BANK had offered. It's called payment packing, it is illegal and I'm sure it has happened to countless customers. They're able to do this by having you focus on only certain aspects of the deal. With your mind on whatever that aspect is, they move around your down payment, give you "discounts" on backend products (warranty, gap etc) and in this case, FRAUDULENTLY inflate your interest rate in the name of their own profit.

Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from Mercedes Benz of Calabasas. Don't let the franchise fool you, these guys are your run of the mill snake oil salesmen and you'll have less of a headache and maybe even more honesty on a used car lot.</Review>

The car was 2 months late and the order specifications on the car were incorrect. Then after all these problems they had the audacity to tell me they wanted to mark up the price on the car. Please anyone who thinks about going to this dealership, don't waste your time thinking and go to another dealership.< /text>< rate>

I leased a CLA 250 2016 at MB of Calabasas recently. The customer service is awesome, Elliot Mossayi helped me get a great deal on the car. Everthing was done very fast and the paper work was minimal. I went in around 3:00 pm and drove away with the car at 5. 2 hours for the whole thing including the test drive of the car. I really recommend MB of Calabasas and will certainly go back for my next car.</review>

Purchased my AMG GTS here. The only one they had, which was in the showroom. I was in communication with Corwin for a couple days prior already and he eventually got me a great deal. Not much haggling from the dealer as they were very honest and helpful throughout the whole process. Will bring my business here always.</text>

<Text>Great experience buying a pre-owned GLE350 located on the internet from Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas. Sheena Farantino-Baca replied quickly to our query on the vehicle to schedule a test drive. She was friendly and professional, no high pressure sales. Working with the manager, Peter, she was able to arrange our purchase and delivery of the car to us the following day.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I have leased a '12 and '14 E-Class 350 from the facility. Fleet Manager, Gary LeClair, handled the purchase of the '14 and I felt so comfortable with the way he handled that transaction, I contacted him re:Lease of S550. I talked with him on a Friday and by that Monday we had reached an agreement on the leasing of the S550. I had certain specification regarding the leasing of the S550 and he met and exceeded my request. His professionalism, thoroughness, knowledge of the car will always lead me back to Mercedes-Benz Calabasas. Mr. LeClair patiently walked me through the complicated functions of the S550 to the point that it was easy to grasp. He further helped me connect my cellphone for hands free talking. I was extremely pleased with the short period of time that it took to handle the financial process which was handled by Mark Berman. If you are looking for a high end vehicle and a dealership with professional employees and staff, I recommend Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

The car was taken in for two recall notices (one for the airbags), and they asked my wife if they can take a look to see if there were any other repairs that are needed. She agreed, they then emailed a list of $6,000 worth of repairs and all but one was unnecessary. They then told her that the recall part had to be shipped from Germany so they were gonna need it for a week. They even wrote that she was leaking oil like crazy yet there is no evidence of an oil leak where she parks at home. The only thing keeping the hard sell repairman at bay was pointing out how horrible MB vehicles must be if all those problems exist on a car with less than 60,000 miles on it. We told him our regular shop would do any of the necessary work and he finally realized he wasn't going to get any add on business.

Followed at the regular mechanic, and he looks at the list and says bullsh*t, this car is fine.

They had a nice loaner car though.....</text>

We have had nothing but unpleasant experiences at this dealership due to their arrogant behavior and snobby attitude. When my husband went in to lease a vehicle, the salesman, Arti, was quite insulting and insisted on showing him less expensive models when he was interested in the GL450. When the lease ended and we went in to discuss options to either return the vehicle or get a newer GL450 we were again met with this type of condescending behavior and were spoken to as though we would not be able to afford it. Please, we can afford to shop here, you just work here, so get over yourself! We have taken our business elsewhere and could not be happier. Will never again do business with this dealership and will make sure our friends don't either, which is too bad, because they will be missing out on lots of business. We don't need to pay lots of money to be mistreated.<//review>

Kyle Wiens: is my service advisor. I recently brought my CLS AMG 63 in.  anyone who owns one will understand this post I just needed tires . Tires put on any car should be a well thought-out decision. But specially on the 63 you can burn the rear tires off the car in one afternoon.
I set down with Kyle and we talked about the tires that come stock on  this car. We talked about tires that Mercedes-Benz carries and we also looked at tires that they don't . Who takes the time to show your tires that they don't even carry. After some recommendations from Kyle I ended up going with a Pirelli medium to soft compound yeah!! I know it's not going to last long but what a ride and so much grip. I would like to think Kyle and all the Mercedes staff there for their family feelings and non rushed service .Thank you Kyle the car has never handle better.

Oh yeah forgot to mention that they don't carry that Pirelli Tire there they had to order it for me thanks Kyle</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29f300363411b:0x5dadd4e1956499b2< /gmap_id></record>

Arin is beyond professional and the service I received from him can not be described less that 5 stars. He listened to my concern, helped me with the baby car seat to be put on the courtesy car and had my car fixed! Wouldn't ask for anyone other than Arin for future service. Thank you Mercedes Benz!</Review>

I completed the purchase of my new car in record time, thanks to the excellent customer service and attention to detail. This team took the time to understand my needs and how best to finance them.

The financing was aided by Angel Santana, who offered expert, friendly advice. Navid Mehrad handled and explained all the paperwork and our purchase was complete and we took delivery same day.

If you are looking for a quality new or used Mercedes Benz, then give David Koeppel a ring at Mercedes Benz of Calabasas.<//text>< pics>

Buying a car from Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas has been the most stressful process I've ever gone through buying a car. They have been extremely disorganized with getting me what I need. I have been waiting for almost 3 weeks on registration and every time I call no-one seems to be available, and when they are they have to call me back...BUT NO ONE EVER CALLS BACK. I have been trying to get answers from them about financing and registration, I can't even drive my car because I have zero registration. Worst customer service and follow up I have ever seen, especially after spending so much time and money. So disappointed and disgusted with this dealership.<//Text>

All I can say is "OMG" ! But I should really say "AMG" ! I just got a new AMG A45. I can tell you from my first call and chat with David Koeppel, to delivery (including working with their finance guy David Amby, I had a wonderful experience. Decent price - I got a good deal and great interest rate. David found me the car with the specs I needed, got it shipped quickly at their cost and had it ready for me a day early. He did not try to sell me on "stock" or other car. This was my first Mercedes and It was great. Nothing they could have done better for me. I'd highly recommend and refer.<//text>

<review>Had a great experience with my pre-owned purchase at Mercedes of Calabasas.  I purchased a beautiful 2007 E350 Key to the Cure special edition.  My sales person Veron, is all about service with a smile.  After the test drive we discovered the panoramic sunroof was not working properly.  Veron made sure the repair was part of the deal.   Because of this I could not take the car with me that day since it was going in for repair.  When the car was ready I didn't have a ride from train station to dealership.  Veron picked me up at station.  After that, service department didn't provide me with repair paperwork.  It took Veron 2 weeks since he was given the go around but he got me the paperwork.   If you're in the market for a nice pre owned MB go to MB of Calabasas and ask for Veron.< /review>< Response>

Just purchased my very 1st Mercedes Benz yesterday and it was a great experience!  I went with the GLK 350.  I absolutely love it!

I had amazing service from the moment I walked in to the moment I drove away in my new car.  Everyone I worked with was very friendly and helpful.  My sales rep Tim took care of me to make sure I test drove the car and showed me all the great features and packages the car comes with.  Tim and the Sales Manager Phillipe did a great job assisting with my trade in appraisal.  During the time between appraisal and working on financing before meeting with the Finance Manager,  Tim was very nice checking in with me, giving me updates on the status of the process, offering me beverages, and making sure I was ok. He was also making sure to do everything he can to make sure my car was ready by the time everything was done.  He was made sure the car was washed, gassed up, all the stickers were off, etc.  David the Finance Manager was also great to work with.  Very friendly and very informative while going through all the paperwork.

Only bummer I'd say was not being able to throw in the coffee machine with my deal.  My french vanilla cappuccino was so good! haha :)

The GM Sean Fortier does an excellent job ensuring he has a staff that provides excellent customer service.  I was very impressed with the professionalism of this dealership and will for sure be referring people to go to Mercedes Benz of Calabasas.

Thanks Mercedes Benz of Calabasas for making me one very happy girl!</review>

<Text>We Purchase a used car in 2014 for my wife & In 2015 took it to its first maintenance because the SRS light had kept coming on from day one but ignored it. Needless to say the Mercedes dealership near our home said it was the Air Bags & cost of repair  was several hundred dollars. My first reaction was to call the dealership. After several repeated phone calls & emails I got no solution. Apparently the protection I bought did not include air bags warranty, which to me is a huge safety issue for our family. The total bill for repairs which included several small issues totaled for more than $14k, yikes!  My biggest concern was the air bags & only wanted Mercedes of Calabasas to cover Air Bags which was only about $800 dollars compared to my bill of $14k in repairs. After being refused to fix repair by several Managers ( Dominique Montes & several others).  I then sent certified letter out to Sean Fortier, General Manager to let him know about our complaint and until this day I have yet to be acknowledged by him. Since I got no responses from Calabasas Mercedes, I directed myself to  Mercedes-Benz  Corporate offices who I did respond but they directed back to the Calabasas store, who I no longer wanted to deal with after 7 months of back and forth. They asked I speak to service department and speak to service Manager, Roger Ullen.  Roger Ullen from them moment I spoke to him I felt really cared about trying to resolve my bad situation. He was instrumental in helping satisfy my complaint and if not for him and his Team along with  Alon Asherson this would have gotten ugly.  Thanks to the Amazing Service department everything was resolved and the ONLY Reason I am endorsing the Service department  and  giving them 5 Star Review.
Thanks you Again Roger and Alon for all you help in making this Nightmare go away. Keep up the Great Work and always make your clients/customer First.
Now for the sales crew and GM, I cannot speak highly of them and will not endorse them as they are a reflection of their department managers and they need to spend some time with Roger Ullen and his crew on how to handle customer issues in a professional matter no matter how Big or small.  This would help boost up sales. Thank you</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The Service Department at Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas is excellent.
Elon Asherson, a Master Certified Service Advisors always treats his clients with the upmost attention and respect. In addition, he goes above and beyond to take care of every car service detail for his customers.
The entire Service Department gets a five-star plus rating!

< Review>
Here's EXACTLY what this dealer did.

1. They cold called a guy from a craigslist ad (me).

2. Gave me an offer of between $22k and $25k over the phone sight unseen, other than the pics in the ad- to buy my car.

3. I explained the car is NOT showroom ready, dishing every detail INCLUDING some costs on which repairs would be needed to make the car perfect for sale on a Mercedes used car lot (2003 Porsche 911 C4S) -prior to agreeing to come out, *warning them ahead of time* that I do not like to be "baited and switched." AND I'd be coming from Moorpark, nearly 25 MILES away.

4. Well sure enough, I get there and the nit picking begins, though I was told "we totally understand it's a 12 year old car".
5. After (finally) looking at the VIN and running it, they come to the understanding that there was an accident, though the title remains a clean title. ---well DUH, that would be the failing paint on the right front corner panel and right door which *I warned them about* (they admit their cost only a $250 per panel repair ==$500 and for the accident they now want to take me from $23k to UNDER $20K)

Making a LONG story short, soon thereafter, they say they don't even WANT the car after I was ready to let them steal it wholesale at $20k--- for a 2003 Porsche 911/996 C4S with 105k miles and IMS Upgrade RMS done and 20k miles new Sachs Racing clutch!!!

They greedily walked away from a car they would've invested a total 22k in AFTER repairs, turned it around on their used lot for 28k, walking away with SIX GRAND PROFIT GROSS!!!

---instead, they get nothing, and I get a wasted Half of a day, a WASTED TRIP and minimum TEN BUCKS fuel cost to and fro- (25 miles to and 25 back).

THANKS MERCEDES BENDS OF CALA-BAT-SHITS!!!</Review>

As usual, perfect service. I have complaints about my 350, and wouldn't buy this car again, but the shop is great.<//review>

I LOVE LOVE LOVE MBZ Calabasas! The staff is Superb! The E-Sales Agent Verron Wilkens was so professional and attentive to my needs. I am a woman so going to a large Car Dealer can be intimidating.. This is so not the case with MBZ Calabasas. I found my used 2006 BMW X3 via online and to my surprise I was approved and drove off the lot with challenged credit and a decent down payment. The New Car sales Manager Dominick Montes is awesome, he treated  me and my young child like elite customer 's despite buying a used vehicle at a very reasonable price from a luxury car dealership. My last point of contact basically the man who sealed my deal the Finance  Manager Mehrad Navid was truly a gentleman and amazing Finance manager unlike other dealerships where the Finance Mgr is like the Grim Reaper. Mehrad gave me adequate information about the vehicle he made sure I purchased a extended warranty because the mileage and year of my vehicle and the icing on the cake I was approved through the bank that I currently bank with.
I recommend Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas as the place to purchase your car with Royal 5 Star Service!< /Text>

I had two issues come up at almost the same time, and the Service Dept squeezed me in and out in 90 minutes.  While I was there they also paired up my new I Phone to work remotely.  They try hard for their customers.<//Text>

I have been shopping for a used Mercedes for about 3 months now. Went to a few different dealerships before I decided to check out Mercedes of Calabasas. I was a little hesitant becasue of the location and kind of people I assumed shopped and worked there, but I had such a great experience overall. I found a pretty cheap C 250 on their website and booked an appoint. with Arin. He had the car ready for me by the time I was there and was very pacient with me. (I decided to test drive a few others within my price range.) Arin was very fliendly and helpful. He was very knowledgable and made the experience very easy for me. Since then I have kept in contact with Arin and even refered my cousins to him. He made a stressful expereince a very pleaseant one. Kudos.<//text>

What can I say it's a car dealer.  They will lie till they get caught , also some of the sales men are scum.  The lady who gives you the loaner vehicles is a sweetheart.< /Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1384804933543</Time><review>I am in the market for a new C250 or CLA250 lease.  We stopped by here on the weekend and they were so pretentious and rude I would never buy anything from them.  The first sales guy said he was "too busy" and called over someone else.  When we told the next salesperson what we were interested in and brought up the lease specials MBZ is advertising he told us "yea toucan find those on the internet but they don't really exist."  We wanted to look at the CLAs they had and he said they were "all high end" models and clearly wasn't offering a test drive.  He went on with a few more pretentious rude remarks and we left.  I earn more than enough to pay for a MBZ lease and have a perfect FICO so I don't know what his deal was but after that I would NEVER buy anything from this place.<//review></record>

My father who is 73 bought his car 300D Turbo Diesel 29 years ago. Till this day the diesel 4 door looks like the dealer just rolled it off the lock. My father insisted to take this car to MB Calabasas for any service every time.

One day this car will be mine and i will continue going to them for service.< /Text>
