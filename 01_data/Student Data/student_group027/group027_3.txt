Not 3 stars but ok place to stay. I have seen better but there are definitely worse.  A lot of pools, tennis courts, and play areas. Also a private walk with exercise course and machine weight room w clubhouse. Homeless presence in dumpsters daily. I would not rent here unless I didn't know, or all I could afford. Must visit and weigh the benefits vs the negatives.</Review>

<text>Rental lease agreements read completely differently from the actual life style this apartment complex will provide you. I have experienced extensive exhausting arguments on numerous occasions with management at these apartments and while their agreement reads they will provide us parking and correct and up to code living spaces. Absolutely everything is halfway complete here, they are only coming half way through on their promises, but not to worry because they will demand your monthly rent in such an aggressive manner you would believe they are attempting to cause a physical altercation with you. My threats of complaints to the rental housing association have been responded to with phrases such as “Well we know EVERYTHING about you.” Not only do I fear for my personal safety but I fear for the safety of my properties and for this reason we no longer stay at this complex. If you want to avoid a nightmare avoid this place at ALL costs!< /text><Resp>{'time': 1619546715069, 'text': 'We apologize you feel this way.

Nothing works. Literally. Gates, Outlets, smoke alarms, the vent above the stove, dishwasher tilts out of its place, your carpet lifts as well. Unsafe. And if you have multiple cars. Good luck, parking is hardly available in the entire complex for those with more then one vehicle. May say “Gated community” but there’s always homeless walking around here, it’s disgusting. Tried talking to the ladies in the office nicely about the parking and was basically yelled at.< /text>

Parking is horrible you’re allowed one vehicle per adult on lease and you can’t have 2 parking spaces and at night all the guest parking is full so if you aren’t in a spot prepared to be towed DO NOT MOVE HERE IF YOU WORK LATE SHIFTS</Review>

I been living here for almost 4 years and every year the rent went up more and more and it was not worth it. (btw today is our last here) and also there’s not security so homeless are a promise there and the gates are broke most of the time. I bet they could pay a security guard with all rent they charge us.</Review>

<Text>Don’t expect to sleep past 5-8 am!!!!
I’ve lived at Torrey Ridge for 10 months now, my only complaint is the management/customer service. I work 3rd shift but have been woken up several days a week Before 9am, every week, since I’ve been here. All because they allow their landscapers to use gas powered leaf blowers to blow dirt from the road 2-3 times a week between the hours of 6-9 am. They have broken noise ordinance several times and I have been in contact with the landscapers boss, he even gave me his word that he would have his workers starts elsewhere as this is a very large complex with 4 pools to say the least. I even left a message with the property manger and never heard back from her. The office manager says no one else has complained and I said that’s great! The simple solution would be to have the workers start at the oppose end of the complex. But they have refused to do anything about it for 10 months straight after multiple weekly visits to the office, 10+ phone complaints and I will say I will never renew my lease or live in these apartments again. So now Torrey Ridge and their management are missing out an an easy $12k(that’s what it roughly costs to live here) because they want their residents to be miserable for the entire year they have a lease here, all so the road can get dirt blown off of it. Terrible terrible terrible!  *on a side note there’s a white challenger that revs his engine past every speed bump and multiple other residents love reving their V8s every possible chance they get rolling through the complex as well! Super annoying and I have a V8 myself so I know how unnecessary it is!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

No parking whatsoever so we’d use food delivery options so we wouldn’t have to walk across the complex late at night. (It’s so big that every delivery person <food or package> got lost because of how big the complex is.) I went jobless for awhile and they were always posting signs on my car that it should be moved. I’m not using it so why do I need to constantly move it? I live here. I pay my rent. Broken Gym equipment. Four pools advertised and yet they were ALL closed the whole year since winter was coming (I assume) so they were too cheap to fix the filters until this summer came around. Broken gates. Broken doors. Broken appliances. Lost count many times I had to call to have my fridge or oven fixed. So glad to be out of there. They offered $200 off one months rent for referrals but I wouldn’t even refer people I dislike.</review></record></dataset><record>

Only few things are okay such as the apartment space, the appliances in the apartment are centuries old, laundry room all old appliances doesn’t wash your clothes right, doesn’t dry all the way thats why haven’t seen anyone using that. Management I don’t know, the 2 girls who work in the front are very nice. If you have problem in the apartment just know it might take them weeks to fix, such as something simple as rewiring for WiFi it’s taking them to get someone to get that done around 2 weeks frame. So please be aware of all these before getting your self into something like this. Just heads up. There are tons more things<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Homeless people always in the complex digging through trash cans. Security is almost never visible. Gates sometimes don't work. Tow truck company are predators. They will take your car in 45 seconds quietly. The landscape workers make too much noise almost every day and because of this you won't be able to sleep during the day. Parking is limited, we once had to park outside the complex. Key to the pools don't work. The maintenace workers are quick to respond but take too many shortcuts because they are lazy. Kept coming back 4 times for the same issue. Swimming pools are off limits most of the summer. Frog infested much of the year all over premises. I just think they are overpriced for the southeast area where cops and helicopter is always out there due to the high crime area. Deserves 0 stars.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

It was an uncommon instance and assure you that our number one goal here at Torrey Ridge is help our residents have a comfortable living experience. All the following concerns you shared are things we most definitely can address so long as those concerns are communicated to the leasing office. Our gates are fully operational and if ever needing maintenance we do coordinate an appointment for service. Security sends pictures and notes of all daily patrols to our leasing office and may be onsite at times one may be inside their apartment. Any persons you believe are not residents on our property you may contact the security patrol after hours to advise. The towing company contracted with the property only tows vehicles illegally parked or those who park in a residents reserved parking stall. Landscaping takes place during business hours to ensure the community is maintained for our residents to enjoy. We do have a large community here at Torrey Ridge  but with that said you are provided one free covered parking and do have substantial open parking areas throughout the entire community. Keys provided to you are all functioning, if you could not get into the pool is was due to the pool being closed and not available for use at the time you may have attempted to enter. Maintenance reports all work orders to our leasing office in which we then follow up with our residents to ensure the work orders are completed to their satisfaction.'}<//Response>

<Review>I've been living here for about 3 years now and I have mixed feeling about the apartments. Here are my thoughts:

Pros
1. Pet friendly (with a price)
2. The green areas are always very well taken care of.
3. Gated community (when the gates don't break)
4. Never had my house or car broken into

Cons
1. Most apartments haven't been renovated in a very long time.
2. I have had multiple maintenance calls where my concerns are just dismissed.
3. Monthly pet rent (where does all of this money end up going?)
4. Rent goes up every year without any upgrades to the apartment.
5. It took them almost 3 years to replace some faulty washers and dryers.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>It reminds me of a motel the way it looks inside. Everything is so basic. Gate doesn't work lots of times and takes forever to fix so it's not a secure gated community. Have seen some petty crimes inside. Stolen tires and broken car window for example. Rent is ok. Also, the rat and bug problem has been fixed for at least a good year now, at least in my apartment. Also love my walk in closets. Just about the only positives about this place.</Text><gmap_id>0x80945ed58eae65f9:0x288b52a6a4a1ddfd</gmap_id><Rating>2<//Rating><UserId.>103837866419425130446< /UserId.>< user_name>

<review>Great place to live. Staff are courteous and are willing to work with you in all situations. Maintenance is the best part. They fix anything within a day or two. The only bad part is they don't tell you who will be hired to clean after you move so I had to pay for cleaning twice. I asked twice they said they couldn't tell.</review>< response>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>My roommate and I moved in in a rush, because her previous lease was ending. We were told the apt at TR we had on hold needed the AC repaired before we could move in. It took a few days, we got the call, moved in and the AC wasn’t fixed. It took almost 2 months at the end of summer 2017 to get it fixed! Plus the wiring in our breaker was burnt out. So things had to be fixed multiple times. They have their maintenance men do electrical work, instead of licensed electricians. (Probably why they had an electrical fire a couple years ago) Our apt was 96 degrees almost every day. I made 13 calls to the office and they only wanted to credit us $100 toward rent. (I learned if your AC hasn’t been fixed in 48 hrs, you have the right to withhold rent) I had several work orders filled out for so many cheap things that broke. (We stayed in the 2 bed, 1bath) the trimming for the carpet kept coming up because the screws didn’t have anything to go into. 2 of our outlets didn’t work and the ones that did were loose. Blinds constantly broke or got stuck. The AC struggled because I had it set to 76 and it never went below 80 unless the weather did. Plus everything has glossy paint. So the print from different boxes etc that we put on the shelves in closets stuck to the paint. Glossy paint and a hot apt are a bad mix. When my roommate opened her closet the door stuck and paint peeled off because the door and trim stuck together. The first time I vacuumed there was pet hair filling my vacuum. They did not prepare the place for us like they should have and we had to put in way too many work orders. If I had known more, I would have saved my money and moved into the hood. $860 a month for things constantly breaking is just greedy. I wouldn’t recommend it, no matter how nice the outside looks.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80945ed58eae65f9:0x288b52a6a4a1ddfd< /GmapID></record>

Lived there. There’s a big dead grass field full of stickers. No parking. Someone tried to kick my door in. Someone also urinated in front of my open door while I was moving out. Told them I would be out on January first which is a holiday so they were not open. Turned keys in first thing in the morning on the 2nd. They charged us for that. They said we could drop our keys off in the rent drop box but never told us that ever. Also how would they know it was our keys. Broke the lease on military orders. They charge a 175 cleaning fee regardless out of the 300 dollar security deposit. Expensive as well to live in a slum like apartment in the ghetto.< /Review>

Old apts for a very expensive rent. I have the worst experience with the AC. Last year it took a month to repair it. For some reason I stay another year here and same bad experience again. The AC doesnt work again and the management just keep telling they will send somebody and its been a week. Sooo expensive to live here and its not worth it.< /review>

< Review>
I've lived here for 3 months. I was deployed when my wife moved in. We notified management that our air conditioning and heating hasn't been working at all about a month ago. The fan doesn't even kick on. They've done absolutely nothing to help. It was 55° this morning inside and I have two small children. Honestly thinking about getting outside help from the JAG to force them to fix it or get out of the lease. We also have no grass in our yard, a dying plum tree, showers that leak and a sliding screen that has no lock so the wind blows it open. Worst experience ever.<//Review>

Bad apartments no real parking for guest at night, also expect to get your car to towed 10 minutes away and pay a fee of $400 just to get your car back from them Sierra towing. Also expect your car to get broken into and there suppose to be security officers protecting the complex but not once have I seen them!</review>

<name>Jose Leal</name><time>1507925169101< /time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>I lived at these apartments for all of 2016 so a full year until my lease ran out. I loved my loft apartment and enjoyed having a park there for my son. About 6 months in my lease rats were eating through the walls behind the dishwasher and when I saw one called the Apts and they brought mouse traps and the next morning 2 were dead. They patched up the holes with some putty and did not even clean the mouse pee or poop. Flash forward to my 8th month and the holes started appearing again. Again I called maintenance and they took forever to come. Put up for the rest of the lease and left without a question. I had to throw away so many of my sons toys and was not reimbursed. The management there really sucks. After I left my friends there told me they had the same problems and moved out due to rats eating through walls! Eventually all of the people I kept in contact with loved out due to the rat problem! Future tenants beware specially if you have little kids about the rats because sooner or later due to that area there are so many rats around will find a way to get inside the apartments. You have been warned<//text>< Pics>

Avoid this place like the plague!!  Where to start, the management is unprofessional, maintenance and security is a joke, and be prepare to deal with homeless people digging through your trash.  Our unit was broken into because management decided to place a bright yellow paper by our door during the day time, indicating that we weren't home and maintenance will return at a later time.  The worst part, we never even requested for any maintenance.  When we called them regarding the issue and why they sent maintenance, they simply stated that it was a human error.  I don't know about you, but when my home and privacy is violated I want more of an answer than "sorry, it was a human error."<//review>

WORST PLACE EVER! It looks nice but it’s not as it seems so many issues with these homes , mice & roach problem never get fixed! Kids can’t even be kids in their own homes without people or neighbors complaining , Everything’s jacked up in these homes some windows are hard plastic windows don’t even lock, The tub paint comes off , ALOT of cars get broken into here. They say there’s security here But I’ve NEVER seen them!! Cameras don’t work , management are rude & disrespectful not helpful at all. Worst decision ever made to live here! Can’t wait to leave this place!!!!<//review>

Pros:
-Landscaping is very well maintained
-Plenty of areas for people with children to get in some physical activity
-large area to go jogging, walk your pet, or take someone to go walking with you

Cons:
-very limited parking
-roaches
-inside of apartments are old and not up to date
-roaches
-Tulare entrance to complex is always crowded
-roaches

This place, and like many other places, has its goods and bads. I loved the large area on the south end of the complex because you can go jogging, walk your dog, or take someone with you to walk and talk and it was great. But then on the inside of the apartments you have old cupboards, bad wall sockets, and an endless supply of roaches. I would clean the counter tops one day and wake up the next day with roach legs, egg sacks, and roach droppings everywhere. Pest control was called plenty of times but they spray the corners of the unit and leave within 10 mins. You won’t be living with them, they will be living with you. Also, parking is pretty bad. If you do not get a parking spot close to your unit before it hits 7-8 pm, you will be parking 1/4 mile down the complex or having to exit the complex and park across the street in the residential area. Torrey ridge will be a good place to live if they deal with the roach and parking problems.</review>

I do not recommend this place especially for military. I am a military wife, and when it was time to move because my husband was stationed somewhere else they gave me hell! Even after I gave them all the paperwork that stated that my husband is station somewhere else they still denied me the 30 days or they would give me the 30 days but they would charge me for breaking the contract. When I know exactly military can break contracts if you're stationed somewhere else . They also try to scare me by saying they have a military attorney . But I know my rights and I kept giving them proof of what I was saying.  after our attorney our military attorney sent them an email saying or stating that we're station somewhere else to let us go. they finally did after almost two weeks of struggling. I felt like they were trying to take advantage.  This was not the only time they try taking more money away from us. I sent out a check early for my rent and I sent it early incare there was a problem they can tell me before the 5th so I won't get charged late fee. But no they waited until after the fifth so they can get more money out of us. I also met this other person who use to live here and this person is a military as well. So now because he had to leave for deployment they give him bad references and because of that no one wants to rent him a place anywhere. That is very wrong!! I have nothing but bad experiences here. I have a brand new car and I've lived in other apts and after the first month of living here my car got bibi gun shot over night.  I'm asking myself where is all the security they claim to have. My screen window was pulled out. Someone was trying to break in over night and still no security!  I did see the security a couple of time. But on the phone or else they park the car and walk to the restaurant by us. This apts are ghetto!  I left my trash can to dry outside and someone stoled it. They also have gates but anyone can go in. Or even some times they leave them open over night.<//Text>

This place sucks and the management is a bunch of idiots. If you have more than one car don’t move here there is no parking.</text>

Love love love Black Velvet Coffee! I love all of their teas and their dirty chai tea latte! They give away cute stickers for free! And of course I had to buy their beanie with their really cute logo on it and it’s in my favorite color! I definitely recommend everyone tries this wee coffee shop out! You won’t be disappointed!<//review>

Best coffee place in mammoth! I stop here at least twice every time I’m in town.
The drinks always come out in the perfect temperature and taste. Staff is friendly too! Prices might seem steep, but if you get a Starbucks in the mountain that’ll cost you $2 more. And here you don’t have to pay extra for milk alternatives, really fair!< /review>

<review>I really loved all the latte options and it seems like such a cool place. I ordered their breakfast cookie which was great until halfway through I found a hair in it...We were far too out of Mammoth at this point to go back, I tried finding a number to contact the shop to let them know but couldn’t find anything. Just super grossed out after that< /review>< Pics>

Would have given this place 5 stars had they carried almond milk and caramel sauce. I love the atmosphere of the place and all the workers I've come across were exceptional. I always forget to get the names of the workers who do a good job but I came in around 5pm and one of the workers said he was new, well he was very polite and he deserves the recognition for being a lovely batista!! He also made an amazingly delicious Mocha. I plan on coming back more often as I live in the area now.<//Review>

This is our go to coffee shop when in Mammoth. The baristas are always friendly, and the coffee is delicious. Today I got a vanilla latte and was asked what kind of milk I wanted. Surprisingly they have almond and oat milk available with no up charge! Love this place and highly recommend.< /review>

<review>This spot has a very modern but rather eclectic setup. Good service.  I enjoyed my latte.  Wife enjoyed her tea which was brewed from a teabag the barista filled by hand from a jar of tea leaves.  Never seen tea made that way before.  I'd recommend this spot if you're in the area.< /review>< pics>

<Review>I love that they made my tea bag. So the tea leaves sit in a sealed jar to keep in freshness! The staff was friendly. Such a chill atmosphere! It is a coffee bar by day and wine bar by night!

Excellent coffee and waffles.  A must visit on every trip to mammoth.  Skip Starbucks and come here.

Good selection of pour overs, milk drinks, and coffees.</text>

<Response>None</Response><text>All the comforts of a hipster hotspot with superb drip coffees and frothy almond milk lattes to back it up. The minimalistic and industrial decor gives way to a posh three-level space begging for heated discussions on environmental issues.  On the second floor is a wine bar worth mentioning, but the first is a perfect coffee shop with a selection of pastries and gluten free goodies.  Oh, and waffles made to order that smell like Christmas morning.

Also should mention that our barista was an absolute pleasure conversing with.</text><rate>5<//rate>< pictures>

Being a big coffee lover I couldn't wait to try a local roaster. Got an espresso and a pour over, what better way to taste the beans. So the double espresso was more of a single shot and the pour over was so watered down I ended up tossing it.</review>

They even cleaned my travel coffee mug. Small detail that means a lot.
All the ladies working during my visit were friendly, professional and smiling.
Good fast WiFi and great music to chill, drink coffee and get work or other stuff done. No pressure to leave even when there are few seats avaible.
Upstairs is a wine bar which I'd love to visit. Looked fantastic. Great use of the space. Kinda wish they had better veiws of mountains out of there large front windows that let in loads of daylight. Snug but bright!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I have to stop here every time I'm in mammoth.  Hey, last time I went to mammoth, I went simply to stop here!   Their staff is always friendly and welcoming and they are doing a fantastic job of making everyone feel safe during this COVID19 stuff.

The lattes are great, they make some of their own syrups and non dairy milks are available if you're in to it.   Last time i visited I grabbed an iced chai.  The batista made it nice and spicy; just the way I like it!   I wish I could remember her name.

The real winner here is their cold brew.   They use that gorgeous, science experiment  looking drip system.  It produces a far superior product compared to most coffee shops' bag in water method.

They have multiple options for beans to go, and they'll grind them for you if you need it.

Thank you guys for being such a consistent, reliable, and tasty stop!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80960dcbc012429b:0xf925d79cb57880de</Gmap_id></record>

<review>Bringing speciality coffee to mammoth, Black Velvet is my favorite place to caffeinate alongside a good book. The espresso is excellent and the baristas pour 🔥 cortados, cappuccinos, etc. While almond milk isn't my favorite alt-milk, it pairs well with their spro and actually steams well. Would recommend this spot wholeheartedly!< /review>< user>

Great spot, great experience.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and make you feel right at home. They make your coffee for you as they ring you up, so there is a nice personal touch with each drink. Almost feels like making a drink with a friend at their house.

It is obvious that this is the best coffee in the area and always worth the line.

Expensive average coffee.  But, its Mamouth, so that pretty much explains the cost as compared to quality.  If you need a cup o coffee, go here...support the locals.  But...there are far better places in the Eastern Seirra Mtns to go to than Mamouth.</review>

Pretty sure that was the best cappuccino I've ever had.  Both whole milk version and oat milk.  Plus grabbed  pour over coffees Brazil and Tanzania and they are so smooth!  I usually always need cream in my coffee,  I don't with these.  Yuuummmmm< /review>

While drinking my underwhelming coffee I watched them make other pour overs and understood why my coffee was not what it could be.  No prewet, no timer no scale... No apparent measurements or care taken.  Might was well been drip... Drip is fine but not when you're paying for a pour over.

We had a private event with around 90+ people for 2 hours recently. Rori and the staff went above and beyond to ensure all the guests were taken care of with plenty of beer, wine and of course their signature coffee drinks. Excellent place to host a large gathering in the Mammoth Lakes area.</Text>

<Text>Best coffee spot in Mammoth! Though the wait was a bit long, their coffee is top-notch. I had the best peppermint mocha I’ve ever had (really hit the spot on a snowy day). My girlfriend had an Americano, which was amazing in its quality and simplicity.

Also had a fresh made waffle, which was hot and gooey and delicious. I’ll never get coffee from anywhere else in Mammoth.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

Great third wave coffee shop. Pour over was tasty and they have some cool cold brew methods I’d love to check out when it’s not snowing! The shop is three floors with lots of nice seating options. I wish they had organic milk, they have raw milk which is awesome but it doesn’t make any sense to heat raw milk for a latte as you’d end up neutralizing a lot of the raw benefits. I’ll definetely be back.< /Review>

<Review>Fantastic espresso! Friendly and knowledgeable staff in a pretty cool building.

Bonus information: I went on the recommendation of a stranger at the bar the night before. I really couldn't have imagined a better way to start my cold morning, and I really hope you take the time to get suggestions from the locals while you're here. The whole experience, from the recommendation, to the final sip of espresso, secured a very special place in my heart for the entirety of Mammoth Lakes.</Review>< user>

The coffee was excellent and the staff was always friendly. A little over priced, but it’s worth it to treat yourself. The vibe of the place was relaxing and a great place to hang out. We’ll definitely be back (:< /text>

<text>Top 5 dopest coffee shops I've ever been to.  Got a TON of work done, drank a horchata coffee with oat milk... Out of this world. They use super high quality coffee beans.  No jitters at all.

<text>One of my favorite shops in the world, maybe because I grew up in Mammoth and this place means a lot to me in sentimental ways as well.

The environment is my favorite thing about BVC. It always has a lot of creative folks hanging out inside, whether they’re downstairs on the main floor, by the roaster on the second, or in the nest on the third.

For coffee, they’re the best in Mammoth. Their selection of beer and wine on the side is well-curated, and they mix it up often.< /text></record>

<Text>Delicious espresso and nice location with plenty of seating. They roast their own beans, so the take-home coffee is also great. I haven’t tried the wine bar, but the Belgian waffles are made to order. They’re an unusual texture for waffles (dense and chewy), but a good pairing with an afternoon latte.< /Text><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Awesome specialty coffee spot. Lots of seating (three stories) and high quality drinks. I got an amazing cortado and almost got a second. I don’t believe they serve drip coffee, so expect to pay a little more for a drink. However, I remember the pour over being surprisingly cheap.<//Review>

If you want great coffee that is roasted properly and prepared with care, then Black Velvet is your place!... reviewed 1st time back in 2014...
.... April, 2021... updated my review from 5 stars to 2 stars... employee skills have dropped... prices have gone up even more! And they were high 7 years ago!
I was hoping new owners would take it to new level... it's worse!!
I used to come here 4 or 5 afternoons a week... tried it 5 times since March 1st... not coming back.<//review>

I came in for a pound of coffee. Staff was slow and not particularly friendly. Long wait. Decor is 'cheap
trendy hipster", fine but a bit silly in Mammoth.  Price was $14 for a pound. I brewed the coffee three times and found it poor quality.  Instead of chocolate, fruit, etc notes as promised on the bag, I only got a chicory flavor. So much for overpriced coffee. I've lived in a lot of places all over and tasted a lot of coffee. I found this whole experience to be a bit insulting.<//text>

The pretentious specialty coffee shop that a place like Mammoth has to have. But it does have good coffee and a really cool building. I love the different single origin coffees you can try. A bit over priced in my opinion but didn't stop me from coming back.<//text>

<review>The furniture looks hipster, the coffee is not. We had an absolutely overpriced tiny and dry muffin that must have been more than a day old and a TINY waffle, a complete ripoff. In addition, veeery watery, terrible coffee --any cheap coffee you can buy at a random kiosk tastes better.<//review>< userid>

The deliciousness of cappuccinos are highly subjective to their maker so it may be unfair to rate this shop based on one cup, but they make the most delicious cappuccino I've ever had. And any time I'm travelling I order cappuccinos, which is not to say i know what I'm talking about, but these are hands down the best among many.< /Text>

<text>This is an excellent place to come and enjoy your favorite coffee. They have cold press coffee as well as the coffee drinks that you can find at the other known coffee shops. Cappuccino is my favorite. They do not rush making your drink so it is done well.
Only drawback I think is that they don't have outdoor seating. I know there is winter here but during sunny days it would be nice to sip it outside.
they are also well priced.</text>< rating>

Best coffee in Mammoth by far. A little bit too much milk in the latte (you lose the taste of the coffee). Really decent prices, especially for quality. It's a popular place so do expect a wait.< /Text>

<review>Best Lattes at Mammoth Lakes

Blue Velvet Cafe is a hip place to get a good latte before you hit the Coach or Ralph Lauren outlet next door. The cafe is spacious and decorated in an eclectic black and white motives. Super friendly barristas.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Black Velvet was recommended to me and went in for a cup to go and a few bags to go for the next day.  Asked the Barista which coffee tasted like a Hardy French, she replied with shrugged shoulders, she didn't know.   I guess I'll just stick with Starbucks near my condo at least I know my Barista knows their beans.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>The WiFi sucks. If you don’t have an Apple iPhone or Mac Book aka Apple device, you will not be able to connect to the internet. Very weird but my iPhone was able to detect the network but my Sony Vaio could not find the network at all. As a web developer, I had work to do for a client, therefore need to connect via laptop. The coffee was overpriced at $4 for a drip coffee that was nothing special. I had better coffee and WiFi at the Starbucks down by Vons.< /Review>< Pictures>

It was a bit busier the next morning, and they had two people working, the same nice guy barista and a girl barista wearing sandals (yup sandals). My gut told me to wait for the same friendly barista, but of course we got her and ordered our teas and decided to try out their waffles, well she forgot about the waffles, taking two other orders, when I finally went up and asked her about them, she said “Oh yea, they’re sitting over there, I’ll have them up in two seconds” but she continued about her business, her boss finally had to go up to her to tell her to get the waffles, so she put them in a bag and threw them on the counter, saying “here are your waffles.” Not even a sorry for the wait. If you go to this place make sure you don’t go to this young lady.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Date>1482532467367< /Date><rate>5</rate><review>Coffee for anyone who writes, calls himself/herself a writer, reads books, reviews books and engenders a love for them is more often than not “on coffee.”  One who is traveled knows happiness is sometimes obscured in the minutia of life, measured in mm found hot in non-neutral cups at BVK.

We visited BVK quite consistently over the course of three weeks in Mammoth Lakes. Coffee is roasted "in house" and the handcrafted waffles (similar to Belgian waffles) were superb.  Daily our adventure was ripe with cappuccino and sublime smells of cinnamon, espresso and glimpses of Matt's hand built espresso machines.

Our family even brought a bag of BVK home for others to try. If in town do seek the ambrosia found at Black Velvet Coffee. BVK libations are an exceptional value, spilling over with quality and atmosphere in Hipster heaven. Thank you Hammer family and the barista team for hot happiness in a cup!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< review>
I had very good service there, with baristas willing and able to talk coffee-nerd talk.  Their beans were good and fresh, and the extractions on their Synesso were consistent.  The vanilla latte was too sweet for my taste, but another double-shot fixed that up nicely.  I'd raise the brew temp another degree for the beans they were using, but that's personal preference (the extraction was bright but not sour).  I didn't get a chance to try their cold drip or pourover coffees.  They carry Fevertree lemon soda, which is great find (the Ginger Ale is famous, but IMO Blenheim's Red Hot is head and shoulders above everything else).  That was a great complement to the munchies from Bleu just down the block.  The atmosphere is that of a modern industrial shop vs hippy vs homey vs sophisticated wood-grain shop.  I like them all if the coffee is good, which was the case here when I came through -- I went there every day.<//review>

I opened my bank account at your bank this afternoon. The whole process went very smoothly. Since I entered the bank, I have received warm reception and patient guidance from two consultation desks, especially the supervisor, Ms. Carrie, who put down the work at hand and did it directly for me.  Go through the account procedures.  I am very grateful for her professional acceptance, careful verification, and proficient operating procedures!  I am proud of being a new customer of your bank!<//Review>

Seamless, professional, and very timely. I needed some funding for a big home project and basically within an hour I had it. My loan officer, Yolanda Cordova was excellent!  She listened to my needs and quickly offered a solution.  Her professionalism and follow-up practices were great.  Thank you Valley Strong.< /text>

Thru the years I have held the relationship with my bank and it’s representatives as one of a partner.  They have been available for advice, opinion, and statistical data to aid me in financial matters. Valley Strong has assembled some of the greatest team members to come along side my team and I to assist, advise, promote, and offer the assistance I need to financially grow and prosper in today’s business environment with empathy and professionalism. I whole heartedly endorse Valley Strong as a business bank meeting my needs and surpassing my expectations.</text>

Took way too long to get a simple cashier's check. Literally was in line for over 40 min. I'm not a very patient person, but this was ridiculous. Literally cars that showed up after me left before me.. worst experience in my baking life with Kern Schools< /review>

<Time>1518060123254<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Gave this branch a second chance after my first visit waiting in line for 30+ minutes almost an hour just to make my car payment. After a while got help with the app so I found it easy for myself to make my payments online. I just needed to withdraw money from my savings yesterday, since I don't have checking or a debit card can't do it through an ATM.  I literally was in for a wait, so I went to the front desk at the entrance and yet I was waiting again, so instead I decided to leave knowing I had to be at the other side of town for an appointment. The receptionist chased me down asked what I needed after briefly explaining she told she can help. That gave me some joy someone going out of their way to help me. Going back inside turning my car off, turns out she misunderstood what I needed help with. Once she directed me to the line which was shorter then the line I was already waiting at she told me it would take 2 minutes. 6 minutes passed by and I got out of there (ridicioulous). If it wasn't for the great deal on my car financing I got, I don't think I would have a any other open account or service with them. This will probably be the last time I walk into this branch.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have not personally used this used this credit union but I have heard nothing but good news about them.  And I  am sure as a former bank employee there can be some extremely long waits as this place is always packed. I  was walking by one evening when I saw this bike parked out front of the credit union and it's owner using the atm. I  took a couple of pictures of the bike while waiting for him to finish.  I loved the saying on the bike "Carpe Diem" which is Latin for "Seize the Day". My service dog Conri wasn't so sure about posing with the helmeted young man.</Text>< pictures>

15 windows and only 3 open, the line is almost to the door, WORST KSFCU IN TOWN! Not that this review is going to change that, but maybe, just maybe some of their people will read this and they'll know how bad I want to punch them all in the face! And from the sounds of the people in line with me I'm not the only one. Hey KSFCU keep up the bad work!< /Text>

I waited 40 minutes to get helped by a teller. The staff was not friendly at all. It's unfortunate that they don't have more tellers available. The line is always long, and noticed they don't accommodate for handicapped people. :(< /review>

< Review>
Why does anybody bank here.  They have long lines, don't give printed copies of checks at the end of the month.  Other banks I've dealt with have had virtually no lines and you get copies of the checks you've written.  Last time I went here, there was a line of more than 30 and only two open windows.  They don't seem to care.</Review>

This has to be one of the worst credit unions when it comes to communication with their members they shut down your account before they issue you a new card and don't even tell you. You go to use the card and you find out that way when they tell you there was a breach somewhere and they sent new ones but they shut your account before you get them! GO TO ANOTHER CREDIT UNION AVOID THIS ONE</review>

<Review>They're soap shampoo is great!!! The staff is so nice and helpful. I've been wanting to buy a soap shampoo bar but was really nervous, one of the employees explained how they work and recommended the Honey I washed the kids one and I LOVE IT!!! She also gave me a sample of the Revive hair moisturizer and it's amazing! Definetly a good place to start if you're trying to reduce your plastic consumption.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I needed hand cream and after washing my hands they gave me a sample of Handy Gurugu. I bought some because it made my hands feel awesome.< /Text>

Some of the employees are really awesome and helpful, but a few others stick out like sore thumbs; rude and unaccommodating. This location is pretty 50/50 depending on who you get.<//review>

I love their products!! Good ingredients, ethical business model, and everything smells delicious. I feel super special and pampered when I use their stuff. I wish the space was a little bit bigger, and they had a couple more thrifty finds.<//text>

I really like to go onto the store it relaxes me and makes me feel comfortable , the environment is quite friendly .  The product I like the most is the handmade soaps I’ve tried  most of them  and they smell phenomenal . It’s very refreshing to  bathe with the soaps.  Can’t wait for new  types</Review>

The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to help us out. They let us try some free samples and helped me figure out what was best for my skin type. I appreciate all the options that they had. It was a pretty typical Lush store with all the usual items.< /Text>

First timer... Absolutely loved this place. The people were super friendly. They answered my questions without pushing for a sell.  I loved the products I tried in the shop and purchased some to use at home. I have been back to buy more. I am a Lush shopper for life</text>

This store has the feeling of a farmers market because most of their merchandise is not in packaging because they don't want to waste materials (which I think is a great thing). They have all sorts of types of soaps that I didn't even know existed. They also have a plethora of hair care, dental care, and skin care products. I am absolutely going to come back.</text>< Pictures>

This store may be a bit more expensive than Bath and Body Works, but the quality is so much better. Their soaps are luxurious, and I love the lingering smell throughout the house! Plus, knowing how environmentally conscious they are makes them worth every penny!< /Review>

<text>Since the moment I entered this shop not knowing what to expect or what it was about the staff immediately made me feel welcomed. Sine then I've been to this shop 5 times and was remembered by various employees 3 times. Lush is now my favorite store and I believe what makes this store not only awesome by their products is the staff! I love coming back to this store because just the smell of the products relax me and they have a very friendly staff that are always answering your questions and help you out while finding the right product for you. I must that's very unique too because they show that they truly care to help and aren't just helping you because it's their job. Even though it's the only Lush I've been to I know that it's truly the best.<//text>< user_name>

Overpriced soap with nice packaging. Nice for a gift, I guess, but not something I would routinely purchase for myself.</review>

Very rude staff members. I went in knowing what I wanted with two of my friends today. Within just ONE minuet they where waiting for me outside the store due to the horridly unfriendly staff members. It was such a bad environment they could not even look around without feeling like they where doing something wrong. (We are good people) We where looked down upon for reasons I don't know. Getting glances from the staff that seemed hostile. Typically LUSH employees are extremely kind and helpful, this is not the case in this location. They where bossy and rude it was overall a terrible experience. Great products though!!!!<//Review>

< review>
Wigs are very expensive for synthetic hair the price is $98.00. Which is a RIP off. You can order online for way cheaper and better  hair. Please don't  spend this type of money  with this business.  The customer service is poor.<//review>

I bought products then they followed me around like I was stealing. My associate was taking her time getting her items. Yet, these people acted as though I didn't buy anything and I tied my bag up to keep down suspicions.....
So asians think we all steal, I guess.....SAD</Text>

Decent selection of wigs and extensions. The prices here are great and much more affordable than other wig places in the area. All excellent prices and good quality.< /Text>

I've been going to this shop on and off for years.  They had good product selection way back when, but since they've expanded the square footage there are additional good selections of hair for braiding crocheting, wig styles and hair products.  It will remain a staple of mine.</review>

They have a wide selection of both human hair and synthetic wigs. They allow you to take your time to make your decision. They will also trim your wig as well.<//Review>

They have everything u need ! Staff (girls) is very knowledgeable and friendly.  I bought hair, hair accessories, and blinged out sunglasses. I was very satisfied with my purchase. There is a lot of street construction that might lead you to believe they're closed.. Just park in the back lot , follow the sign, and walk around to the front. I found everything I needed hope u do too.<//Review>

4 stars for having red cherry lashes that I can quickly grab in a pinch! I usually prefer order to them online, since they're cheaper, but this is a great place to buy them too. I also like to grab some NYX products here as well. They have a large selection of other beauty necessities and have a very convenient location. Will be coming back here.< /text>

Kind of expensive compared to other supply stores. It's set off to the side and blocked with the recent metro construction. Would give 5 for service but prices too hihh
I understand why though.< /Review>

I went to purchase a wig.  I'm a first time buyer.  Soooo many wigs to choose from.  But separated in sections so you can find what you're looking for.  I had a specific style in mind.  Sales force greeted me immediately.  I told her what I was looking for and she directed me there.  I was told that I needed to purchase stocking cap to try on wigs.  No problem safety first.  I tried on several and settled on one.    So far so good.  I next got it styled by a man forgot the name, but that didn't turn out so good.  Long story short, he cut off too much.  We had a disagreement, but he was willing to give me another wig.  I didn't take it because it wasn't the color.  I could have waited for the Wig to come in but I just went with what he cut.  You learn.</Text>

<text>DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY WIGS FROM THIS PLACE. I went looking for a 100% HUMAN HAIR LACE WIG. I told the lady exactly what I wanted. She took me to the section that was labeled human hair. The wig that I decided on I made sure to ask her again if it was 100% HUMAN HAIR and she assured me it was. After about two weeks having this the wig started to shed bad and it got very stiff and acted as if it was synthetic. After doing research I found out this wig was synthetic hair. This wig was only worth no more than $100 online. When they charged me $350!!! RIP OFF</text>< user>

If I could I wouldn't give them any stars...I just walked out of this place. I was super excited to get a new full synthetic lace front wig that I saw on YouTube. There is a Hispanic chick who I saw standing next to the wigs so I asked her if she had the wig I was interested in and in which they did. As she proceeded to show me the wig I asked her how much it was and asked if she could tell me why it's more money in the store and less if I were to purchase online. She proceeded tell me with a very nasty attitude " well people have bills to pay so that's why it's More here. People have lives and you get to try it on in here " .....it wasn't like I didn't have the money for it I was just wondering....Stupid ass lost a customer because I will never step foot in that establishment again and little does she know I was going to buy the wig including hair care products. Don't bite the hand that feeds you...I guess great customer service doesn't matter anymore these days.....< /Review>

They have a really big selection of hair products, wigs and loose hair, both natural and faux. They're a bit expensive, but the customer service is good and they really do have more products than other similar stores.< /Text>

Nice hair product just to high in price due to the Metro there are barriers in front of the store so you have to park in the back there is exit for a wheelchair but it's very bad potholes going to the front from the parking lot so I don't think it be too safe for a wheelchair but if you're hanging on tight to them it'll be alright</review>

What 👏 an 👏 amazing 👏 bakery 👏!!!! I’ve been gluten free due to Celiacs for over 7 years. One thing I miss is some good old fashioned homemade bread. Flour Chylde’s Daily Bread is PERFECT! It tastes like real bread and I was in heaven eating it! The Tahini Chocolate Cookies are THE BEST chocolate chip cookies ever! The shop is so clean and cute, and the service was very friendly. I live in a different county so I’m so pleased that they ship to my location so I can order whenever I want! Looking forward to trying more of their baked goods!< /Text>

Delicious foods. So many great gluten free cookies and cakes. The only knock on them is how expensive it is. Thats probably a good thing. Otherwise I'd go there way too often!😋<//Review>

It is literally one of the few bakeries where you can go in and order without feeling guilty about how healthy it is going to be for you since almost all they offer is gluten free and natural ingredients driven selection. If you are concerned about what you put in your body then this is the place for you. Love their Rapture, Chocolate olive oil and orange zest cupcakes. I can't forget to mention their amazing meatloaf lunch sandwichs as it is one of my favorite meals over there. Finally I have to mention this amazing crew who work behind the counter as they are the nicest, the most understanding and helpful all around... True practice of Zen and Patience as it is not easy to order considering the wide variety of options they have in front of you which always lead to taking longer to order than the usual. I definitely recommend this place.</Text>< Pics>

A friend brought me a (very large) selection and the star of the lot was the oatmeal cookie (buttery - check. chewy - check. crispy - check. depth of flavor - CHECK), but everything else was incredible too. The coffee cake wasn't quite what you might expect - it was chewier and almost eggy, and less light-and-fluffy, but it was delicious and wonderfully cinnamony. The teff chia bread was chewy and delicous - an important note is that it was delicious without toasting! Rare in a gluten free bread.</Text>< pics>

Rustic orange and the one with lemon flavored, and the rest of them are just delicious, but they are $5 each! Very expensive! Guys I am sure if you drop the price down, you are going to sell way more, a lot of people that I know had told me the same, that it is expensive! Love you guys, and I love your food. Thank you<//review>

<review>I just want to clear up I’ve only purchased these from the farmers market in the Bay Area. I have a gluten allergy and always have a reaction after eating anything from here. It’s so delicious which is why I gave it 3 stars but I think for advertising to be gluten free they should make sure no cross contamination is a problem.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>The food and treats here are wonderful! You don't have to be gluten sensitive or Vegan to enjoy the tastes of good food but if you are, this is a great place to "dog ear" a necessary visit in your travels 😉<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Been going to Flour Chylde for a few years now, but haven’t been in for several months. Much to my surprise, that when I went in this morning, I was disappointed to find out that they’ve not only dropped some of our favorite sandwiches (Ham & Brie, Salami, and Tuna) off the menu, but they’ve also jumped the price up to $9.50. So, I paid the $9.50 for a Turkey and Brie and when I got it home, I was extremely disappointed. Barely any Turkey or Brie on it, plus it was bland as a water cracker! Not what I expected at all after paying $9.50.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Flour Chylde is a gluten free bakery offering cakes, breads and a few ready-made mixes. It is one of the delightful shops in downtown Novato that still has a "personal" feel as well as high quality product. I love the Rapture cake!</text>< Resp>

The sandwiches, even when I ask them to toast it for longer, are never really crispy. The sandwiches aren't bad, but they arent the texture I enjoy in a sandwich. However, the Linzer, chocolate chip cookie, corn bread muffin, chocolate peanut butter muffin thingy, shortbread cookies, and all the other sweet pastries I have tried there are some of the best I have ever had.< /text>< Pics>

This place is fantastic. They have the most amazing gluten free, dairy free, and vegan pastries and sandwiches. It's affordable, tasty, and easy to take people to as it's in downtown Novato.

Everyone in my family loves this place.  They have something for everyone.</Text>

< review>
Nom. I went to the Mission Community Farmers Market. First table I passed a guy was holding out a sample of some kind of baked good. Below him was a spread of heavenly looking edibles. I'm not a foodie, and I was only planning on getting produce so this was unexpected. I looked at the guy and told him thanks, but I'm trying not to eat gluten. He said that's good because his stuff was all gluten free and pointed to the giant sign behind him. I tried the sample and it was delicious. He asked if I wanted to try something else, so I had something chocolate and I was sold. I bought two muffing things, one was lemon and chocolate and the other was chocolate and something. They weren't cheap, but man oh man they are good. And beautiful. If you want some gourmet gluten free baked goods this bakery is amazing.<//review>

<Review>Gluten-free bakery. Slightly pricey, but we had lunch for two for $20.

Their iced tea was fantastic. I had one with "African" in the name, and it was flowery, maybe a Rooibos blend. $2 refills are a little prohibitive, though.

The bread was good for gluten-free. The white-bread analog we had had a dense texture like a cornmeal cake, and the flavor was unobtrusive. Both my wife and I got our sinuses singed on the horseradish mustard used on our sandwiches, so if you don't like spicy mustard, maybe ask them to go light on that.

We did not try anything sweet, but the presentation was very strong, and I was sorely tempted by a molasses cookie.< /Review></record>

This bakery has a great selection, all gluten free,  and everything has tasted exceptional. There's only been two things I didn't like from here: the Kalamata olive round(which had a bit too much salt for my taste) the Linzer torte(which tastes more like an olive oil cake than a browned butter torte). Ive had their goods fresh from several farmers' market locations around the bay, as well as fresh from their cute boutique like storefront in Novato. They sell baking mixes there that are exceptional and priced quite affordably. The staff is very friendly and appreciative.<//review>

If you're in North Hollywood and want some quality fish, look no further. There's a reason you'll find a line out the door during eating hours - the food here is THAT good! Customer service is top notch, they'll help you customize your bowl however you want. My first visit was March of 2020, and I'm sure I'll be back when I'm in the area and craving poke!<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I’m not kidding, this place is so special.  Worth noting: the community loves chef Brian and Brian loves the community.  His energetic passion for meticulously creating DELICIOUS, quality cuisine, served with such care and kindness, embodies the very definition of excellence:  To do even the smallest things in a great way is the greatest thing one can do.  Brian deserves a freakin statue.  Also, best poke bowls EVER.

< Review>
So a friend of mine dragged me to this place... She introduced me to the Chef Brian and told me to trust him. I have been told that if I don't like poke from other places I may still like it here. However, I didn't even know what poke was. I typically stick to what I know I like and I also avoid fish for the most part... I then decided to take the leap of faith and try something outside of my comfort zone. So, I let Brian guide me in my ordering process. Not only did he ask my likes and dislikes, but he gauged my excitement and tailored a cocktail of a poke bowl just for me.

I took my order to-go to avoid disrespecting the chef with the face of a skeptic and a disappointed customer. My roommate assured me that if I didn't like it she would gladly assist me in dealing with the left overs... As she was staring at my food like she hadn't eaten in weeks.

The outcome not only surprised me, but it woke taste buds that I had apparently been starving from a flavor profile like I had never know. Needless to say I am now a fan of PokéMotto and Chef Brian. If you gain any wisdom from my experience I hope that you trust the chef.</Review>

I was that annoying customer requesting "something tasty and low carb." Instead of the eyeroll I deserved, the chef cheerily asked me a few questions, quickly creating for me a poke salad (kale, seaweed, cucumber, etc) that was about the healthiest yet most delicious lunch I've ever had. All ingredients incredibly fresh and high quality. This place is astounding.< /review>

< Review>
Despite the name, this is not your average poke spot.  Serving high quality sushi omakase (Chef's choice - a prix fixe menu curated nightly) by reservation only Thurs - Sun evenings, be sure to grab your spot at the chef's table! They order an appropriate amount of fresh fish for every omakase session so understandably, impromptu guests cannot be added same day. This is a very memorable, intimate experience and I highly recommend trying it out.

No omakase dining session is alike, since unique fish are ordered seasonally, and the chefs are one of a kind masters of cuisine and entertainment. All the strangers I met the night I went agreed not only was it an amazing meal, they could have charged a cover fee for the laughs as well.

I've tasted some of the best sushi I've ever had at PokeMotto not only due to the quality served, but because the chefs take the time to select exquisite types of fish and at different ages as well. Chef Brian narrates your meal as he preps an artisanal experience, touching upon the intricacies of the fish he selects and how he achieves umami goodness with every plate served.

I was blown away by the creative dishes varying from the simple to complex, sometimes pairing ingredients or technique to bring out the best flavor of each course. Chef Sang adds even more variety to the table by utilizing a different approach to his dishes and together they balance the dining experience perfectly.  They really understand their audience without making things pretentious.

With decades of experience under both of their belts, Chef Brian & Sang are animated and eager to cater to your tastebuds. I've been to a lot of high-end sushi establishments in the L.A. area and PokeMotto easily puts them to shame without breaking the bank.

Oh, and the poke bowls are pretty awesome too. Not only are they reasonably priced, they taste amazing and it shows - all the locals love this place so it can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner prime time. Order ahead online or get something delivered. Whether you go for poke or omakase, you won't be disappointed.  Fresh ingredients and quality fish paired eloquently with flair result in an epic meal every time.</Review>

Chock full of character, attractive bartenders, nice pool tables, great jukebox, huge selection of spirits, karaoke on Wednesday nights, often live music on weekends, this is for sure the favorite watering hole!< /Review>

Had a late night dinner at the Brass Rail a couple nights ago and I was so delighted with my meal I had to write a review. The bacon cheese burger was amazing, the meat is super high grade, the bun was soft and delicious, even the veggies were on point (proper Roma tomatoes not grainy watered down beefsteaks and fresh crispy lettuce and onion). The honey sriracha chicken wings had me in a state of food bliss. Undoubtedly the best burger and wings you can get within an hours drive in any direction. This place is a must try if you have not already made the stop. I am so thankful to have this option in our town.</Text>

<Text>Great for live music, decent bar food. I like all the theme parties they put on. I would give 5 stars but the bathrooms are well....less than acceptable as I had a gentleman standing right outside the stall I was in not 3 feet from me and looking over the low door. Needless to say it was very uncomfortable.</Text>< gmap_id>

I read the other reviews before writing mine and apparently I’m not alone in finding the server attitude far below good service - it’s not possible to give below one star. I’ve been here numerous times in the past over the last seven or eight years and always had a good time, with prompt service. Tonight that was far from anything close to that. After ordering a round of drinks and food, we played pool. My next drink order was ignored. 3 times. My daughter got, I admit, Mama defensive and she and her friend left. I tried to talk reasonably with the bartender and literally everyone at the bar went posse on e, ignoring her rude ‘locals first’ behavior. I come from a very small island, I get that ‘We’re so cool’ schtick. They were juvenile and pathetic. And lost a nice tab and tip. One arrogant barely more than a child said the bartender was also the manager. Wow, really? Good luck with that! When the adults come back in the room, however long that takes, I might go back. Probably not. Oh, and when she learns how to make a proper Moscow Mule (like they used to do?)that might help too.</review>

Fun atmosphere and great food and they serve food until midnight! Friendly bartenders and nice decor it’s got a ton of history and character, don’t miss it and the rodeo burger is the bomb!

Always a good after-concert bar when there is a show in  town. Weds & Sat. are karaoke nights for the brave or those that just don't care who's listening. Good fun, rowdy locals. Tho the owner & one of the bartenders can be rather harsh at times    ...</Text>

Terrible experience, ordered an appetizer (avocado fries) and they never put in the order. The woman bar tender gave us attitude when we asked her 40 mins later when will the food be ready and then the cook came out and said he never got the order. Mind you she came and sat with me to have a cigarette break and repeated how she doesn't care about any of the customers inside. I wouldn't eat there even if I got paid to. Asked for my money back and will never go in there again.<//text>

She has no respect for the community or any of the people that live here. She thinks it hurts to be 86s from her place of cocaine uses and disrespect. The owner needs to think about what she looks like being so unprofessional. I would step foot in there if you payed me.<//text><time>1489040457859</time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This was my first visit  but heard many positive things about Dr. Smith's Office.  Very clean, very welcoming and very professional.  Once inside my appointment went well.  I was informed about the process from A-Z. I look forward to my next appointment.  I advise anyone who needs dental work and has been looking for the right fit, make yourself a consultation appointment...and then spread the good word!</Review><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66< /GmapID>< Resp>

<review>My husband and I have been going to Dr. Andrea Joy Smith for over 20 years. Not only is she a great dentist, but she's a wonderful, kind person. She went out of her way to help our elderly parents feel comfortable in her office. We would highly recommend Dr. Smith and her staff!<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_name>

Dr. Smith is an excellent dentist who puts you at ease and makes sure you understand everything. Her staff is friendly and professional, and take the time to explain each procedure. I highly recommend her! They are providing quality service at reasonable prices.< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I feel the dentist is extremely busy.  She needs to bring on other dentist,  or take less patients so we can have more time to be consulted.  This is a major life changing procedure,  and to walk in check my teeth, and walk out and have someone else bring the estimate for the procedure did not make me feel comfortable.  I don't think she will allocate the right amount of time for the procedure.   She will probably rush it, and I'm not comfortable with that. Some of the equipment was a bit dusty, and dirty, and  the cost was a bit more expensive than what I was anticipating.   I found a dentist that will do implants for $3000.00. I was being estimated $2600.
Not impressed,  but more importantly,  I just didn't feel comfortable.< /text>< Rate>

I have been going to Dr Andrea Joy Smith for several years now and I’ve never had a better experience from the moment I walk through the door. Everyone is friendly. I’ve never experienced such a caring Dr. she explains everything in detail and ensures that I understand. She definitely has the compassion and kindness that anyone who’s uneasy about the process. I don’t live in the area but I drive without hesitation. I highly recommend. My smile has never been so beautiful 😃< /Review>

I felt quite comfortable with the staff and Dr Smith's capabilities to completely follow me through any procedure of tooth removable which gladly I had a tooth implant to still help my chewing issues.
Dr Andrea Joy Smith is really professional to your experience to be sure you will return for the complete process.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Coming to Sacramento from Reno wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.   Moving up the road from Dr. Smith's was meant to be,  I only had to drive down pass her office.      After a couple of visits,  I wasn't sure until Dr. Smith stepped in and put her experience, compassion, knowledge, and most of all understanding of ones reluctance to Dentist making me feel comfortable.     In my seasoned 64 years I'll have to say Dr. Smith is without doubt #1 in my orbit.          Thank you.   Robb (Stormyy) Cummings.<//Text>< pics>

I had my first visit with Dr. Andrea Joy Smith. I have had a missing tooth for about 5 years. I had a partial retainer & it was thrown away by mistake. I watched a YouTube video that Dr. Andrea had posted on her website. I felt at ease after listening to her explain mini implants. I was able to get a visit within a week. The staff is great! When I finally met Dr. Andrea, she was the sweetest dentist EVER! She put me at ease right away & told me that she could do an implant. I was so happy. So glad I made an appointment & I can’t wait to get my implant.< /review>

I would recommend this office because of how hard they work to make sure their patients are happy.  The Dr. Smith goes beyond to the call to make sure of this.  I am always impress of how long her staff has worked for her, that really says a lot about the Doctor.  When you get to know the staff, they are all very kind and professional.  Can only give a five star and nothing less.<//text>

Dr. Andrea Smith is truly the best that there is! I had been in desperate need of implants for over 10 years and simply dreaded it. But immediately upon meeting Dr. Smith who has the most endearing and warm spirit, I felt relieved and unafraid. Needless to say, I received my implants and the procedure was seamless. Felt 100% the very next day with no swelling or pain and, of course, a beautiful smile. It was truly a miracle! Highly recommended to anyone worried about dental surgery. I promise you won't be disappointed!<//review>

<Review>Dr. Smith really cares about the end product, how it looks, how it performs and listens to the patients concerns.  I am in the process of full mouth dental implants and have had no real pain and the temporary teeth are some of the best teeth I have had in a very long time.  I am looking forward to the finished product.  Yes I would recommend her as the best dentist I have ever gone to.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66<//Gmap_id></record>

I have received great care here. I have had short wait times to get appointments and into see doctor quickly. Even though my initial implants were not provided here Dr Smith has given me great follow up care and improved on some of the initial treatment. I would strongly recommend her to anyone looking to improve their quality of life with implants.</Review>

<Text>I went to see Dr. Andrea Smith for an estimate/consultation on getting some partial implants. Her office is very professional and dr Smith was very kind and knowledgeable about the process I was interested in. Cost seems better than others I have gotten. Looking forward to getting started.

Ive been going to Dr. Smith for at least 10 years and she is the best! Shes very knowledgeable in her profession and has done extensive dental work for me, including 4 mini dental implants, which is definitely her specialty:-). Additionally her staff is so awesome! I refer all of my friends and family to her and I believe she is the best choice if u are searching for a dentist in the Sacramento area< /text>

The staff was warm, welcoming and my entire visit was pleasant. I have suffered from dental anxiety since childhood due to traumatic experiences from dentists. Dr. Smith has a caring spirit and explained the process thoroughly. She is curing my dental anxiety, while restoring my smile!< /review>

My girlfriend recommended Dr Smith to me.  At the time my mouth was a mess. I never really smiled much. Through time and numerous visits I can say I do smile now thanks to the professional work of Dr. Smith and her staff.  And speaking of the staff they are the most helpful group of people who do a service for others that I have come in contact with besides my regular MD. I highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone needing dental services</review>

<date>1579951508218<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I discovered Dr. Andrea Joy Smith one morning  watching TV. After watching her explain about the implants I was so excited to go in for a consultation! I didn't wait long before being called back which is always nice. Everything was clean and accessible for patient care and I was treated like a VIP the whole time. Dr. Andrea is very knowledgeable and therefore explained everything very clearly. Once I had the procedure done, staff checked in with me several times after going home. I really appreciated staff being so attentive to my recovery! I followed the aftercare instructions closely and recovered just fine. I really appreciate the excellent treatment and great experience with Dr. Andrea and her staff. I've never been so happy to go to a dentist appointment! If you're considering dental implants or any other procedures the office offers, I highly recommend seeing Dr. Andrea Joy Smith. Thank you Dr. Andrea!</Text>< Pictures>

Fearing going to the Dentist?  This was me until I came here ,  this is a pain free Dental office .  They take the time to explain the procedures and make sure you’re comfortable,  and with my fear of the drill and needles.....  especially for a major procedure that makes being sedated the only way to go !  Thanks Dr. Smith and staff for a job well done 👍🏽< /Review>

I switched well over a year ago. The office promised follow up calls after meds but did nothing. Had to have a root canal re-done and my partial was poorly manufactured. This doc is way over worked. Go elsewhere.< /Text>

As ever Dr Smith was amazing. After my husband suffered through a botched surgery at a different dental practice this morning, Dr Smith was kind enough to fit him into her schedule and accomplish what should have been done during the first dentist visit. Dr Smith was gentle, efficient, professional, and she’ll be the only dentist he goes to from now on. Thanks to her wonderful staff and her brilliant and kind practice it’s the only dentist I would ever visit either. And I suffer from a serious dentist phobia. Dr. Smith and her staff are the only ones who alleviate my fears. Hands down this is the best dental practice in Sacramento.

Follow up for 2/12/2020
Since Dr Smith is concentrating on her implant patients she has now hired a new dentist. Her name is Dr Basrai and she is very knowledgeable and gentle. I’m extremely phobic when it comes to dentists but she put me at ease. She is very thorough and I highly recommend this dentistry!
5 stars once again!<//Text>

Dr. Smith and Annette  are a dynamic dou! Let’s start with Annette as she is vey kind, knowledgeable, and has good energy! But more than that, she is amazing at her job! My teeth still feel good. I’ve never had my teeth polished using her technique but it was very effective and there was no pain involved! As for Dr. Smith, she is a very pleasant and skilled dentist with a gentle touch. Also, I appreciate her explaining what’s going on with my teeth and acknowledging my efforts to keep my teeth and mouth healthy! More importantly, I never feel judged and she does not try and up-sale her patients!  Lastly, Dr. Smith utilizes the latest dental technology, the wait time is minimal, and the office is very calm and inviting! I can’t wait for my next scheduled cleaning! 😊</Text>

I believe that there are a lot of people being processed through for services, and  more than a few times it seems things are not completely given clarity such as what next steps will be, is my dental care in final stage or are there more steps to complete, just this week one person said one thing was to be checked, and in came another person  and said okay..you can leave now. Additionally, why is it I paid for services completed, and my insurance paid for same services in proportion.

This appointment was a special experience to the continued professional quality I have grown use to from Doctor Smith's office.

The payments and payment schedule were manageable.

The pre-procedure orientation was explained and understood.

Sedation was introduced and applied.

The procedure was completed and explained with clinical care.<//review>

Dr. Smith is without a doubt the best Dentist l have ever had. She is knowledgeable, gentle and just a great person to be around. Didn't know that going to the Dentist could be this pleasant! The entire staff is so helpful and cheerful. My Keyhole surgery was a great success. Highly recommend it!</text>

Having waited 1 he 25 minutes I was finally seen. After a 20 minute assessment was told that I would be a great candidate for the pinpoint him procedure. That I could expect to see results. A financial statement would be calculated. The cost to my 2 insurance policies would be$4000.00 which would leave me $4000.00 out of pocket or more if I went with Botox injections. I called the office to see if they could just do the upper quadrants for the $4000.00 of insurance
Or would I still be obligated to half. I never received a call back. I really don't feel comfortable with the disorganized quality of this office. Not what I am looking for in a professional organization.</Text>

It had been YEARS since I’ve been to a dentist!  My Mom recommended Dr Smith and her staff, and she was AMAZING!!  I had to have some extractions done and was extremely nervous. Dr Smith and her staff made sure that I was relaxed, comfortable, and felt no pain.  I still have a lot of work ahead to get a healthy mouth and teeth, but I know I am in good hands with Dr Andrea Joy Smith and her amazing staff!   Thank You!!!</review>

<gmapID>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66< /gmapID><pictures>None</pictures><review>I lost my upper teeth in an accident in my 30’s and it was truly one of the worst things I’ve been through. I had a bad experience a few years back and I was worried that implants were just not going to be an option for me. I was convinced that I would just wear a denture for the rest of my life. I met Dr. Smith after seeing an ad on TV. She took care to ensure that I was a good candidate then explained the process to me thoroughly before I made my decision. The staff helped me figure out the best treatment plan for me based on my needs and my wallet.

A full replacement of my upper teeth was more expensive than I really wanted to pay but once I compared the cost of mini implants to regular implants, I was convinced it was worth it. I decided on the nicest material because I really wanted them to look natural and stay with me for a long time.

The process wasn’t perfectly easy, there was some problems with my temporary bite and it caused some extra visits. My temporary broke on Christmas Eve and I called the answering service. Someone met me at the office within 30 minutes and spent hours fixing my temporary and ensuring that I could eat Christmas dinner with my family. It was a huge deal to me. I chose sedation for the initial procedure and it was way easier than I thought it would be. Pain was minimal after the procedure was done on Saturday I was back at work on Monday.

After about 6 weeks from the start I have the kind of teeth that people notice and make comments about. Teeth that I can actually eat with. I am so proud of my new smile and I actually open my mouth to talk.

Anyone can write a review about their dentist but Its impossible for me to express exactly what this process has done for me and how well I have been treated by everyone at Dr.  Smith’s office. I still get emotional just thinking about where I started and where I am now after just a couple of months.

I know this is your business but my wife and I will never forget what you have done for us.

While it’s way to early to tell if the PST will deliver the desired results, I couldn’t be more pleased with Dr. Smith and her staff. Dr. Smith goes the extra mile. She helped with reducing some cost when she didn’t have to. Something my personal dentist of 35 years or so has never done, that I can recall.
I felt that not only was I going to a very good dentist, I met a new friend. Her staff was great and helped make me feel at ease. I only wish her practice was closer to home.
My wife who went with me and is in need of an implant was given consideration in the form of X-rays and evaluation at no expense to us.
I would highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone in need of the many procedures she can provide.
We also met her husband who drove us back to the motel of which I remember little if anything. Being from the same state, he took the time to introduce  himself prior to my PST and implant which was done during the same time frame. I had very little pain and really think I didn’t need the three Advil I took afterwards.
You can’t go wrong if your in need of dental services.</text>

<review>This is probably one of the most pleasant and professional office I have experienced and that saying a lot since I worked in the dental field years ago.

Dr Smith goes beyond the call to make sure her patients are happy.  The fact that her staff has been with her for years says a lot about the kind of person she is even as an employer.
My experience is always good when I come in.</review>< user>

<Review>I really like Andrea I feel like she really wants to help me. I am on a tight buget and if I am understanding everything and my insurance I wont have out of pocket costs or at least it wont be much. She understands that not everyone can afford a full mouth of implants. I wish I could tho.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Very nice & professional staff. Dr. Smith is gental & very thorough. She explains clearly and does her best to keep you pain-free (or at least to a bare minimum). There's NO where else I'd go for my teeth care.<//review>

<Text>Dr Smith and her team are the best! We are never waiting more than 3 mins to be called in. My 11 year old doesn't love having her teeth cleaned but she is not afraid of the dentist like many adults I know. This is because of Dr. Smith's warm demeanor and gentle touch.< /Text><Date>1553605774851<//Date><user_id>105156721738050578111<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

Dr. Joy Smith is an a amazing dentist.  She was able to place an implant with success in an area of my mouth that a previous implant from another dental practice had failed.  She really cares a great deal about her clients.  They are a very busy office but I never feel like I do not know what is going on.  There can be a wait at times but because of the deep knowledge, years of experience and great care Dr. Joy Smith has taken with me I would highly recommend her services.  Hope you find her to be as great a dentist as I have.</Text>

Her innate, God-given talents are evident in the work she does;  life-changing artistry into the transformation of a beautiful smile.

< Review>
That was my first visit to Dr. Andrea Smith. I need a hygiene appointment and a general consultation since a need some teeth work to be done in the near future. Sandy from the front office was welcoming and friendly and Jacky, the hygienist was competent, gentle and concerned if I was having  any pain throughout the cleaning process. Dr. Andrea is a very nice person, friendly,  knowledgeable in her field and very easy to talk with. She answered all my questions in a easy way to understand (showing some pictures and explaining some brochures) about futures treatments options that I want to have done in my mouth.Overall I was very happy with my visit.</Review>

I was seen very quickly ! I love the atmosphere and the people were very friendly!    Prices are just right and financing is available 😊  My whole life was changed!!!   Nothing is more important then a first  impression!   I was so worried about what people thought of me because of my missing teeth.  Now I don't have those worries anymore.   Thanks Dr Joy Smith !!!    I don't even have the words to express how grateful and extremely happy I am.   It's amazing to be able to face people with confidence.   Especially the line of work I am in.  I will always appreciate the work you have done for me.     Thank you for my second chance!!!!!   I will take great care of my implants.    I can't stop looking st them !   They look great !!</review>

From the time my husband and I entered the door, we were greeted with kindness, professionalism. Because I am such a coward when it comes to dentistal work which I truly need, from the dental assistant to my first exam with Dr. Brasai, I was catered to and reasured that I would receive the best of care and it truly eased my nervousness. Currently I am waiting to start a treatment plan which I am excited about and looking forward to starting and completing all my dental needs. I truly encouraged others who are having dental issues,  please consider coming to Dr Andrea Joy Smith dental office. A church member referred me and I'm so thankful she did!<//text>

Wonderful, as always - Dr Smith and Staff as good as they get! Great Dentist and a better human being.  She has worked with me to get a great smile after a  lifetime of not having one...she worked with me in every way, she listened to my hopes and my budget and created a plan that worked beautifully.  Thank you Dr. Smith - that is why I drive 4 hours just to keep her as my dentist.  The best!</Review>

I’m someone that has had bad experiences with dentist before that kept me away from getting my teeth fixed. Getting the implants was a pain free process the whole time. I really appreciate Dr Smith and all the staff for a no judgement environment. I would recommend them to anyone that is avoiding the dentist or looking for a friendly place to go. It’s worth it and very happy with the results. Thank you for all the help.</Text>

Dr. Smith has been my dentist for over 18 years. She is honest, caring, and always upbeat and positive. Finding a dentist who is honest and doesn't overcharge is invaluable. We are blessed to have found this in Dr. Smith.< /review>

<review>I live in the Bay Area and I travel to Sacramento to see Dr. Smith. I have been her patient for over 11 years and no matter where I live in California, I make the trip to see Dr. Smith. Family n friends all think I'm crazy and try to recommend other dentists but none of them live up to Dr. Smith.

I have a severe phobia of dentists, struggle with anxiety and have a panic attack disorder. Dr. Smith's sedation services make dentistry possible for me despite my limitations. Other sedation dentists want to use IV sedation but Dr. Smith only uses the most minimally evasive options in all her work, including sedation. I know I'm a difficult patient but Dr. Smith makes me feel like her favorite patient and I am so grateful to have a dentist like her.

I tell her all the time, "If it wasn't for you, I would have no teeth." She smiles n laughs but it's true! No matter what it is that's keeping you from the dentist...fear, embarrassment, anxiety, or any other medical condition...you don't need to live in pain. Dr. Smith can and will fix it because everyone deserves to smile</review>< Pics>

I had my first visit with Dr. Smith today.  Dr. Smith is very knowledgeable about treatment options that I didn't know about before.  She began a treatment with me right away to help  with my chronic pain.  I was there for a consultation and she went above and beyond anything I have experienced before at other dentists.  I am so grateful.   She is very focused on what my individual needs are.  Her staff are also very professional and kind.</Text>

I've had a very troubled tooth, receeding gum and had worried a root canal may be in order. Dr. Smith and her team have worked diligently to help me save my tooth and it worked. I recommend Pinhole Surgery by her, great rate and excellent support and service!<//review>

<text>I've had a rough time with my teeth, no insurance,years of pain med prescriptions (which are horrible for teeth) and not a lot of money. I've seen many dentists but none like Dr Smith. The first time she saw me was for a dental emergency..I was so worried about missing a tooth when I smile and she made sure that did NOT happen. So now I'm a patient here. I do not worry, despite paying because the staff is so friendly, the dentists so thorough, and the pressure non existent. They even referred me to an insurance carrier that's helping with the costs as I need a LOT of work. I needed a good dentist, who was going to listen and help.

<Text>Dr. Smith is by far the best denist I have ever had. I have recommended many of my family and friends to her and all of them have are very satisfied with her work as we all know it takes more than good work to be a denist it also helps if you are a good person and she certainly is that and her staff are great too. Keep up the good work....Gary and Sunita Penny< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr Smith is just so easy going she knows her stuff im kind of loosing hope because of the prize but hey there is a God no i dont want to go to a foreing city to get my work done my damage was caused by some medication the worse is being judge and even by a medical doctor ..who lost his license didnt even know  my name and the question he asked me.. it was sad..and its imbarrasing. But Gods will be done...but even if i dont get my birthday wish to come true ....i will still give Dr.Smith..5 Stars she kows her thing .<//Text>

smooth as boston cream pie the staff is so kind  so professional and so efficient as for andrea such a lovely person  so refined so experienced she makes her job look easy. she made me feel so at ease through a very scary procedure. the passion and dedication she displays in the work she does  is second only to honesty and integrity she displays as a person. when i am sitting there in the dentists chair along with andrea and her staff it gives me that down home feeling , you know the kind you get when  youre coming home for the holidays and sitting down for some good home cooking with family and friends.if it sounds like i cant say enough great things about these people ...youre right  i cant!!!   tell your family tell your friends TELL THE WORLD all about this wonderful place ! i know i am.I'M TELLING YOU NOW!!!!<//review>

Such an amazing hookah lounge!! First off when you get there the vibe you get there is just amazing and they always make you feel welcome as if it is your second home. Next off, there is somebody named David, the guy that packs and starts all the hookahs and he does an amazing job at it. He always wants to make sure that it's 100% and the chances it's not, he'll help you fix that issue. Thank you guys so so much, I will be coming more often.<//review>

the service was TERRIBLE! horrifically bad attitude from the fat main manager. my kabob was so dry at a point i thought i was chewing on chips. decided to try other dishes on the menue that my friends had ordered, the cheescake was frozen, the sandwich was even more dry. would not recommend to anybody.< /review>

<Time>1503440977407</Time><rating>3</rating><review>These guys are a lot better than the previous owners. I went there back in high school when they wouldn't card for being 17 lol Nowadays they have alcohol and a pretty chill patio setup. Service can be slow at times due to their high inflow of people, and they have very slim Hookah choices. Only Fumari, Starbuzz, and Nakhla shisha. I wish they would get Tangiers, Pure, or Alchemist as Starbuzz and Fumari now have all those additives in them. Still if you have no other hookah place to go, it's a great back up and you can still have a good time. The minute they get better hookah flavors, they will immediately go up to 4 stars in my book.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c299407e52a72d:0xf19edd650fcc9e2e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They only have two servers even when they are busy! We had to wait 45 min for hooka and 3 waters and one hour and 30 min for the food and they still brought the wrong order and when we asked to change it they siad it is gonna take a long time so we just had to cancel it!!<//review>

My mom and I have been coming here for over 10 +years. The view has always been to die for but lately it has become grungy and poorly taken care of. There were 5 seated tables total while we were there and our eggs and potatoes came out cold. Our bacon was soggy after asking for it crisp. They then brought back new bacon that was literally black and inedible. We love this place. We will always come and support their bakery but we will not be going for lunch or breakfast anytime soon. Absolute waste of money.
The downstairs seating next to the dumpsters looks downright disgusting. Really hoping they make some improvements because it seems like they just don’t care anymore 😞< /Review>

<Text>Stumbled across the place while in the area, and had the whole inside to ourselves. Everything we were served was amazing, and some of the items were cheaper than what we pay at a generic restaurant back in my city, though it tasted ten times better. They make different desserts daily and brought out a whole platter of their items when we asked for a dessert menu. It’s cute and has great views!<//Text><resp>None</resp><user>112166986759145550396< /user><time>1620006775974</time></record></dataset><record>

Very good food. We sat outside with a heater and it was a wonderful view as well. There’s wonderful bread with a house-made herb like butter to start. We shared a bottle of the Sauvignon Blanc, got the seafood platter, shared the lobster bisque, my fiancé got the salmon salad, and I got the rack of lamb. My rack of lamb was a bit over cooked, but they made me another one right away. They were overly kind about it. I don’t normally ask to get this remade, but I did this time due to the price point and the fact that it was my first time having lamb lollipop (I didn’t eat meat for a very long time). We didn’t have any dessert, despite French pastries being my favorite type of dessert. Definitely recommend!<//text>

<Review>Waterfront.  Nice ambiance. Greeters & Servers are friendly. Food are good. Perfect for brunch or even just coffee time for dessert. Will be coming back for sure. The only reason why I knocked down 1 star was no social distancing amid covid19, the tables were too closed to each other where there were barely room for people to pass by. Otherwise it's perfect.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /gmap_id></record>

Truly spectacular experience.  Wonderful culinary experience (100 times better than in Paris). Friendly and great service. Breathtaking views. Had the opportunity to watch beatifull sunset over Laguna beach. Dinner was also excellent,  the seafood crape,  lobster 🦞 bisque was very good and one of the best Tiramisu I ever had. This is one of kind experience I'll remember for rest of my life. It made my business trip to  South  CA worthwhile.
Update,  looks like I will be coming back in few months and I'm looking forward visiting C'est La  Vie.< /Text>

<review>The food, vibe and customer service was mediocre and I do not recommend.

I want to praise the great customer service and attention that server Alex gave us while there.
At the same time, I would like to condemn the actions and attitude of the server named Justin.

My boyfriend and I sat ourselves and the whole time we were there, Justin who was supposed to be the "assigned" server, NEVER checked on us, brought us anything, or took our order.

Instead, we were served and attended by Alex. While Alex was serving me, I hear Justin calling out to him in a condescending manner and ordering him around while Alex was busy attending other guests. This was very rude and disrespectful to do in front of customers.

The whole time we were there, I overheard Justin tell other guests multiple times how he was glad that he had a server to help (referring to Alex), as if Justin was Alex's master. Very rude and unprofessional.

At the end, I went up to the owner named Jose and explained to him the situation to which all I heard from him was a "thank you and sorry for the inconvenience". His response wasn't that of an understanding employer but more of an annoyed boss that isn't planning on taking actions to correct the situation.

Overall, this placed has a toxic work environment and I feel bad for the good workers that have to put up with it.

I gave this place a shot but will never be coming back and I hope it shuts down.< /review>< user_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>The lunch atmosphere was pleasant and the ocean view patio made dining so much more relaxing. All of our food was very good, flavorful, and had a good presentation. The service was okay, could have been better. The lady at the dessert counter was NOT pleasant at all. She was short with me and I did not feel welcome at all, as I was trying to purchase an item like everyone else there. When I walked over to be with my party, she got in my face (assuming I was not with them) and said 'yeah...' I then simply stated, this is my husband ( a white man, and I am Black/multiracial) and though she might not have expected that, it was unprofessional for her to make assumptions because all people should be treated the same.

Our waiter was fine, but seemed overwhelmed and it took a long time to get the check. The lemons requested took a long time as well, but again the view made the time pass quicker so there were no complaints. I feel my rating is mostly effected by my initial experience with the lady working the pastries. I had a 10% Yelp discount, that they honored, but I went ahead and tipped on the higher amount. So the long and short--the food might be good but if people are treated poorly,for whatever the reason it may be, the entire experience is ruined.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Terrible service, did not receive bread when asked, and server missed a substitution, then when the bill was questioned, received a bad attitude, when ordering more mimosas,  after our coffees, got a big time bad look as we were putting an additional burden on her....bathrooms were filthy. Used to be my wife's and I favorite place, now won't go back.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>This is my favorite place for a great medium rare prime rib.  I'm a huge fan of this city classic and I really wouldn't choose another place for a prime rib.  The sides are pretty good and their wine selection is pretty decent.  Definately in line with their old-school tone.  Great place for a date or dining w/ friends or the folks... even on those last minute prime rib craves, the bar dining always hits the spot.  The staff is friendly and take care of their patrons very well.  And I cannot forget to mention that their drinks are nice and strong.. so if you like that kick in your cocktails... this place is it and I hope to see anyone reading this there!<//Review>< rate>

Loved this place. The atmosphere is great. The service was phenomenal 😊. Been there twice and it's always a great experience. Best deserts I have ever had. Plus food is amazing. The view to die for overlooking water up in the balcony.< /review>

Like 2 other families dining inside.

Around $23 for Salmon Salad that i got.
Salmon was good and salad was a salad. Fresh salad nothing especial about it but it was ok. (I dont really like olives so i left a happy face with them at the end. 😄)

So Larry attended me right away and i sat outside because i chose so.
They brought me those delicious bread with side of butter.
Few minutes later they brought the salmon salad.<//review>< Pictures>

We asked a waiter if we could sit in the mostly empty restaurant after ordering pastries from the bakery — the waiter said choose any table. After ordering, we went to sit down and a woman comes out yelling at us, telling us to sit at this small table section by the street. I explained that the waiter had told us we could pick a table and the woman responded “I would know where you can sit, I’m the owner.”

There’s a polite way to ask people not to sit somewhere, but this was just aggressive and demeaning. It felt like I was being angrily shamed for having a simple misunderstanding.

The cheesecake was also pretty terrible. It was greasy and had an almost grainy texture.< /Text>< Pictures>

Wasn’t the best experience. They have a sign that explains about happy hour at lunch but when you get in, there is nothing. We ordered burger which came with sourdough and was really stiff. The smoothie has more water inside. We came to eat crepes but at 2pm they were already out of them<//text>

I LOVED the food! The seafood crepes was so tasty and the shrimp mixed with the lobster sauce actually MELTS in your mouth. They also have some fantastic macarons. My favorites was the earl black grey for sure. There's also a beautiful outdoor area that gives you a great view of the beach. Perfect for a beach date or a family visit.</Text>

Turns out I didn't pick the correct Paris breakfast meal. I forgot the explanation the waitress gave me but turns out there's 2 Paris name meals. Why would you name 2 meals with the same name? I didn't even point to the menu, I just asked for the Paris breakfast, waitress didn't ask me to clarify which one. Though they did adjust the charge. Service is great here. But food is not so good..... They gave me stale 4 leaves of greens and a think sliced watermelon left out for a time. Sausage link was not hot... As if they didn't cook it enough. Will not come back again but it is a decent place to have breakfast and the staff here is very friendly and great at what they do.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>We loved sitting by the window in this little French restaurant. Wasn’t crowded at all on a Sunday night, and the service was quick. They have awesome dinner specials between 4 and 6 PM. We ordered the salmon sauvage and it was tasty. Salmon was so tender and the sauce was excellent. The veggies could have been more tender. Complimentary French bread before the meal was good, and they gave us more than enough for two.

We also ordered their chocolate bomb dessert to go- so good! Chocolate mouse filling inside a chocolate shell. The whipped cream on top was too hardened, so we ended up scraping it off. We would come back here again.< /Text><user_id>106873828827826587254< /user_id>< username>

Entry dessert display and sales counter are the hook.
Decor, atmosphere, flow of table seating and bar area are the line leading you to the Oceanside deck where continued decor and atmosphere are the sinker.
I'm in!

Host, server, owner were all attentive and friendly.
Menu is extensive.
Quiche was to die for. Gorgeous. Flavorful. not America's typical shaken and stirred pie. This was layers of whole spinach, fresh sauteed mushrooms topped with gooey thickness of cheese resting in a no-crumb-left-behind pie crust.

Husband's burger on toasted brioche was perfection.

The dessert tray was successful at inviting to even the most full stomachs to eat just a little bit more our selections were tough, dry, weak flavor.

I liked C'est La Vie so much that I feel bad giving a review of less than 5 stars.
We vacationed in Laguna Beach. I feel familiarity with a restaurant and therefore, reviews need to be based on more than one meal.

A must go.< /Text><Rate>4< /Rate>< Time>

Good food and portions, good drinks, and best desserts. And great staff.

Inside diners be warned: the management has the upstairs tables too close for effective social distancing, and management does not enforce nose and mouth coverings when patrons walk around inside. I wish the management placed a higher value on CDC guidelines for those of us trying to stay well and not catch CV-19 from inadequate table separation and patrons who put others at risk from not covering their nose and mouth when maintaining 6 feet separation is not likely.< /text>

I am a carnivore by nature but I limit myself to only the best places for a good steak everyone now and then.  This place definitely made my list - I had the bone in rib eye, OMG it was flavorful and just melted in your mouth.  The magical mushrooms were also very good and a good side dish with the steak.  Other very notable favorites were the Tuna tartar, Shrimp appetizer and the mac and cheese, all were amazing.<//Text>

Cedar Lane Roasted Chile Relleno's are the best!  I get them for $3 each, frozen, at our local Grocery Outlet and they are really good.  Lots of protein, gluten free, easy to microwave and a lot of flavor.<//text>

I've never had a meal here that I have been disappointed with. The service is great and options are immense. The bathroom however wasn't kept up well and also the tables are wobbly. You have to overlap the stables to make them steady. I go to this place often and its good everytime!</Text>

Most fire wings you'll ever try here in the bay, all the other stuff is good too! Prepare for a wait though because this place can get packed! I also recommend the green beans<//review>

<review>two days ago was our first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the efficient service, with the high quality  dishes and fine drinks and with the honest pay. We will definitely return there again.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Only been there once but was immediately impressed. C'est La Vie with goat cheese was extremely delicious and the corn bread (with chilli) is a must-have item. If you have scramble egg, order Smoked whiskey fennel sausage, mushroom, baby spinach scramble. I was very happy with it.<//review>

<review>The menu is amazing. You'll find a ton of truly authentic French delicacies like the Monte Cristo, savory and sweet crepes, and quiche. The house special crepes were good but didn't come with any sides. The Monte Crispy, French onion soup, and ham & cheese croissant were perfect. The smoked salmon and avocado Benedict was just ok. All the textures and flavors mushed together. The only place you want to sit is outside on the balcony overlooking the ocean. They also have a great bakery. Coffee is also high quality. Downsides are parking and price. That's what you get when you eat near the beach though.</review>< GmapID>

Very poor service here.. my fries were cold, my burger well done when I ordered medium rare and definitely was completely unseasoned! My dads chicken lime salad was spicy as hell with no lime flavor! My father cannot eat spicy foods. We asked for bread and it came at the complete end of our meal and was very cold and I looked under the plate and it was filthy! For the price I expected much better service! I will not be returning here.</Text>

<review>You really pay for the views of the beach. One piece of fancy dessert is $11. Coffee is $5. I had the pear walnut tart. That was probably my first time eating a dessert at a French restaurant. If that's how a French dessert tastes like, then I'll probably never eat it again. The pear walnut tart tastes too sugary. The tart was placed over dashes of chocolate and cherry syrup on a plate, like what you see in fancy restaurants. I have a tongue that favors natural tastes and refuses refined sugary food. I didn't like the tart. The coffee was obviously been out for a while, not fresh, not hot.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNugkmpoZAgMUMMW5PZyZDfx26dWCnRPwuysBGv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Nice french restaurant in this chic Laguna beach area.
There is a bakery up front and seating inside as well as on the patio.
I recommend the patio seating for some amazing views of the ocean!
The food was pretty good, the service was good - the dessert was absolutely divine. Especially the macaroons.</Text>

DO NOT GO HERE. HORRIBLE SERVICE. NOT COVID SAFE. I came here 12/20/20 at around 4pm and ordered a takeout order and the manager took my order. The server still brought my order on open plates without a mask on. I asked politely asked if they could redo the order as takeout instead and the manager refused. His attitude was immature and disgusting! He made a scene in front of everyone and staff!! He told me that I could either accept the order on the disgusting plates that were served without a mask and NOT covid safe or not be served at all. I told him how my family had driven almost 2 hours just to come here and he was so RUDE. I asked if they could at least make the rest of the order that was not brought out yet to go and he said that I had to accept the WHOLE order or not be served at all. I basically had to runafter him to ask for a refund after paying almost 100 dollars for an order I was not getting. He avoided me and pretended to he serving other customers and made me wait in line AGAIN to ask for a refund. We had come here to celebrate my birthday and this really ruined the whole day. It was a horrible experience and I will NEVER come here again or recommend this place to anyone!<//text>

Wonderful dinner - the highlight meal of our week in Cali.  I totally enjoyed the Cajun Linguini dish (flavorful!) and my wife loved her seafood fettuccini (very fresh!). Waiter Ali was as fantastic as the sunset we watched as we sat outside looking over the beach. A+</Text>

A bit of high roller bill next to the beach, of course, at least we felt welcome and easy going from the young gentleman host with his good attention and service.</text>< pictures>

I had the escargot which was okay. I then ordered the venison pasta and the meat was tough and over cooked. I bought some macarons to go on my way out and was a little disappointed. Ive definitely had better macarons. View was nice!<//Text>

Had dinner at C’est La Vie on Friday September 18 and was extremely disappointed. We started with the stuffed mushrooms that were cold and unappetizing. Next the French Onion soup, when delivered the cheese had harden on top and the soup was lukewarm. The crepe was as thick as a pancake and the seafood in the crepe was sparse. The only good thing about the meal was the scenery. Watching the sunset was the highlight of the meal. Since we did not eat any of the mushrooms and very little of our meal we purchased delicious macaroons on our way out. So go to C’est La Vie to watch the sunset and the macaroons.< /text>

Impromptu dinner as it was we were pleasantly surprised with the excellent food.
Ordered the loup la mer on a lark which we knew after the fact is one of their popular dish.
Topper off with their decadent desserts and now I have one of my fave places to dine in Laguna. The patio view is one of the best to my opinion.<//Text>

<text>Food was delicious. It was lovely eating on the deck with a view of the ocean.. Our waiter was disappointing. My water glass was left empty a few times and he forgot to include an item I ordered. This was our first time dining here andI expected better servce, especially at this price.<//text>< pics>

Really a treasure. We come here every month or so, travelling from Riverside just for the great food and view of the ocean and classic Laguna Beach lifeguard tower from the terrace.<//Text>

<Text>It sits very close to the sidewalk of the beach with good views at the patio back there. While the breeze from the seashore came to air massage , we enjoyed our little dessert time  with the Italian iced coffee and yammy taste of tiramisu cake (solid and modest sweet).
A bit of high roller bill next to the beach, of course, at least we felt welcome and easy going from the young gentleman host with his good attention and service.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /gmap_id></record>

Wasn’t crowded at all on a Sunday night, and the service was quick. They have awesome dinner specials between 4 and 6 PM. We ordered the salmon sauvage and it was tasty. Salmon was so tender and the sauce was excellent. The veggies could have been more tender. Complimentary French bread before the meal was good, and they gave us more than enough for two.

We also ordered their chocolate bomb dessert to go- so good! Chocolate mouse filling inside a chocolate shell. The whipped cream on top was too hardened, so we ended up scraping it off. We would come back here again.</Review>< Name>

<rate>2</rate><text>It could be that they are having a hard time with the outdoor only situation but this place is terrible...

There were only about 25 customers total (vs probably 100 capacity in normal times).
It took 30 minutes to get served: fish tacos and a burger...
Glasses were not clean, theY smelled previous guests drinks (Sprite/ Coke)
Fish taste was awful
Burger was very average
French fries were almost raw

Oh and what is French in this restaurant ? They advertise crepes and quiches. Nowhere to be found.

I hate to say this because I know times are rough for businesses but if you care about food quality then avoid this place.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /gmapID></record>

while this place is not vegan, the chef will work with you to make your experience memorable. We came as a group and, given the French theme, I had little expectations for a vegan menu. I planned on grabbing a drink and perhaps a salad; they offered a large plate of sauteed seasonal vegetables which were done beautifully. The rest of the group was more than happy with the menu selection and the varieties of pastries offered from the in-house bakery.  The deck overlooking the water is one of the best in the area. This is a great place for a birthday or celebration and it lacks the pretentiousness that would normally be associated with a restaurant with a location. The owner is very personable and involved. Faredeh checked in often to see if everything was OK (given the search for vegan options). She was awesome!  I'll certainly be back<//review>

<Review>Awesome location with a nice 2nd floor patio overlooking the beach.  All of the servers were very friendly however the food was only average.  We had crepes, French toast, and a chorizo burrito. Not bad just nothing special. In fairness we did try the bakery or desert items which looked amazing.< /Review>< Pictures>

The food was very good and our waitress was excellent. We had a variety of items and everything was delicious. However, one of the ladies (she may have been a manager or owner) was extremely rude and confrontational.< /Text>

<Review>Tried it out since I had a coupon and it was on our vacation route. Kind of place you might overlook as it was in the middle of block of small shops on a busy street.  Definitely recommend, especially if you're getting tired of the same old menus! Crepes and quiche were our choices, although they did offer the normal burgers, sandwiches, and salads.  Desert is a must, but we took ours to go, as we were already full.  Extraordinary selection of tarts, macaroons, pudding bars, carrot cake, you might just want to stop for one of them and a good cup of coffee or ice tea.<//Review>< pics>

Their 4 to 6 pm menu special has a nice variety to choose from. I had the 6 oz filet mignon, served on roasted potatoes and asparagus with a cabernet demi sauce. It was wonderful! The view of Laguna's main beach from the upstairs patio was lovely. Decided to splurge and shared a warm, delicious peach tart with my husband. It had a side of the best vanilla bean ice cream I've had in ages. I'd go back in a heartbeat.</text>

I love it here. Not as pretentious as many popular Laguna spots. It's got a wonderful rooftop patio with a great view of main beach. The food has never let us down, the drinks are great. The prices a touch high and the service is just okay...but I absolutely love going and sitting outside. You cant go wrong with the breakfast menu, but I also highly recommend the salmon/rice.<//Review>

It seemed that the staff was a bit over-worked or something, though, because we waited a very long time for our food on a Thursday night, and we had to ask for things like tea or dessert multiple times before we got them. Aside from the delays, we had a wonderful time with a beautiful view and great food.</review>< Pics>

Went for New Years day lunch because Nick's had a two hour wait.  Waiting for about ten minutes until we motioned someone over for drinks.  The cocktails we had were the highlight of the trip.  The $20 burger we had was dry.  Asked server for ketchup, luckily the table next to us had some from the last group and was nice enough to hand it over after hearing our frustration.  We never got any ketchup, server probably noticed that our neighbors gave us some.  Fish and chips was average.  The pistachio macaroon was also very well done, rest were ok.  It was $85 for the whole meal for three after two drinks and dessert with two $20 mains.< /review>

As French food lovers, my husband an I almost never avoid an opportunity to try a new place in town. I had a great salmon dish with my man the other day and my husband had lobster and a soup. Great service, great coffee and a fresh menu with daily eats price point. We'll definitely be back when in the area.</review>

<Review>The food was great. Highly recommend the Seafood fetuccine.... They were the best.
Dessert menu was great too.  Lot is options, and you can pick the menu from s tray they bring to your table!!!  It's such a difference to be tempted with them rather than reading from the menu :)<//Review>< resp>

The food was good but our server was lazy. We saw him doing nothing... just asking other people to do stuff for him. It was annoying to watch and it was disappointing cause it was Christmas Eve. I had constantly to ask him to come if we needed something. It would be less stars but it would be unfair since the food was good and the service 2 stars.</text>

Bread pudding was like a brick on a plate(a cold brick) crepe was so bad you’d gag. Omelet was mediocre. So basically Gordon Ramsay would’ve yelled at the owner and made the restaurant shut down it’s doors for good!!!!oh btw we were there celebrating a birthday!<//Review>< Pics>

The view was awesome! I enjoyed sipping on a latte on the balcony while waiting for our food. The espresso is Lavazza which was very good! They also had milk alternatives. The milk froth was not spectacular but it was acceptable.

As far the food goes it was alright. Nothing out of this world but not bad. We both had omelettes. The bakery items looked great but we were too full to try them.

What is worth raving about is the service! We went in at around 11am on a Wednesday and were served right away. Our server was Justin. He was super friendly and made us feel like a local.

We would go back for the views and the great service.< /review>

Excellent food. Great service. Lovely view from the patio. The seafood crepe is a must try menu choice. French onion soup authentic and perfectly made. They have free  parking behind the restaurant, since parking on the street in front of it can be a bit tricky.</Review>

Smelled faintly like vomit when we first arrived, which set the stage. Waiter was very rushed, didn't really listen, forgot the drink orders, as well as parts of the food order. Salad was completely wilted and old. The rest of the food was very good. Other patrons were loud and rude, like it was a dive bar. Laguna has changed, and NOT for the better.< /Text>

Waiters suck every single year. Gentlemen responsible for coffee and water provide best service.  We have been going for 11 years for ambiance, view and food.</Text>

Overpriced and not fresh, they give us a cheesecake from the tray not from the fridge. Also very slow and unorganized. The terrace is nice and the cakes looks great, it is a nice tourist trap.< /Review>

The view from the upstairs terrace here is magnificent. If you're looking for a nice place to have lunch and see the ocean on a pretty day, it's hard to beat. My seafood quiche wasn't quite as spectacular as the veiw. The crust was overcooked and tough, and the filling, although pretty good, wasn't particularly flavorful. The salad that came with it was very nice, but quite dry, to the point where I needed to request extra dressing. It's hard for me to say how much of this was due to the particular day that I went there vs how much is just the way the restaurant chefs prepare the food. I would definitely give this place another go!<//text>

There are no words for how horrible the service is. Came in and was ignored for 10min. Finally managed to stop someone and ask if I could seat myself, answer: "I don't know. Do you see a table available?" I did indeed and sat down. Took 10min to waive a waiter down, another 15 until we could order. We stuck it out hoping it would be legitimately good French food. But we were wrong! Some weird American-PseudoFrench fusion, neither here nor there. On top of that overpriced - most likely due to the view and location, which is actually great.< /Review>

<review>So sorry, but the breakfast here was horrible.  From the runny, almost raw eggs (I ordered over medium) to the breakfast potatoes (they simply slice them into full size medallions and throw them in the deep fryer) that tasted like the oil hadn’t been changed in months, and there was “other” food flavor in the grease as well.  My wife’s omelette was over cooked and rubbery she said.  Oh, and here’s a tip to the “cooks” in the kitchen, people REALLY like small, chopped up ingredients in their omelettes, not giant pieces.  Is it really that hard to find a good breakfast restaurant in Laguna Beach???  Sadly, we will not be back :(< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Location is awesome. Staff not too friendly, food wasn’t anything special (I had the eggs Benedict). I liked the coffee, though. Prices a bit too high for the amount and quality of food. The pastries looked very nice (I didn’t try one but would if I went again).< /Review>< Name>

Reservations and getting there early for finding parking in case their lot is full is a must. It's all worth it when you are served. Everyone enjoyed both the appetizers and their entree choices! Excellent! We had great service and will be back.</review>

Not typical for me to post a moderate review... without a doubt the best this restaurant has going is it's beach front location...just beautiful...food was average (again, I'm easily pleased), and service was poor...
Given Laguna Beach, prices reflected that (pricy for lunch anyway (e.g. $22 for a turkey and avocado sandwich)) but still not a connect with the poor quality food and poor service).
Just trying to be honest for future tourists trying to save a few vacation dollars...< /text>

Had a scrumptious strawberry tart pastry (the crust was like something you dream about) and a large latte...
C'est parfait! Great views from their location by Main Beach.  I would definitely try the Happy Hour specials next time. Of course the Real Housewives of Orange County film here...it's just so French!< /text>

<Review>This place has a French themed but you can order from a variety on the menu. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting to start; add Faredeh to the mix and you will feel right at home. This sort of personal involvement and care from the owner is rare in the restaurant experience these days! If you are a fan of French Bakeries, be prepared. you are greeted with some amazing pastries the moment you walk in. Just beyond that is the dining area with some great window seating for some world class people watching. There is a small and intimate bar reminiscent of an old world experience. If you are looking for a view, the deck overlooking the ocean is a highlight worth the trip in itself.  Wine selection is decent and their prices are very reasonable given the setting. This is a great place to start a day or wind down in the evening. The central location is perfect for either a beach day or a day exploring the shops and studios. TIP: There are a few parking spaces out back if you are fortunate enough to get one while it's empty</Review></record>

<Review>Omg where should I start.... my last night in Laguna my husband and I decided to go here for dinner. We sat at our dirty table for 10 minutes until someone came out of no where with water. After waiting an additional 10 minutes  and wiping the table clean a server came and we specifically ordered the special which was $21.99 for lobster tail and $16.95 for the pork chop. My drink (frozen margarita) was watered down so I asked would they make it over but on the rocks. Not only did they try to charge me for 2 drinks they charged us regular price for the food. We ask them to please change the ticket and they did. After paying and no tip I asked  the manager could I purchase more deserts he said sure to purchase them from the pastry area.... the waiter comes up and asked me why didn’t he get a tip I ask for the manager and he was so rude.... and there was this other idiot trying to gang up on us saying little stupid stuff all the while the waiter is smiling.... I see why this place was empty the entire time I was in Laguna beach. Visit this place at your own risk! And the reason we didn’t tip is because it took them 10 minutes to serve us they stood around talking.... unacceptable<//Review>< user>

We sat down by a table, because the sign said seat yourself, then no one came to take our order cause apparently we sat by “ waiting tables” ( there were menus and bottles of water) After figuring out how we can get served and moving to an actual table, we got very dry pastries that each costed $12. Complete lack of management and quality control.</text>

<Review>Beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately the food was meh. My entree came out cold; both times. I couldn't be bothered to send it back a 2nd time. My husband's also came out at room temperature...not even warm. Way too pricey of a breakfast for sub par food.< /Review>< Name>

I've visited this restaurant since the late 1980's, about 30 years.
Since I live in the San Gabriel Valley, I usually go every few months or years.
The dishes that I have ordered have been good or excellent, 4 to 5 stars.  The service used to be very good, but now it is lacking.
That is why I rated it 3 stars.

I went on 11/10/18.  There is a sign which says to seat yourself.
I sat on the patio and picked up a menu that was already on the table.  Someone greeted me at the table and said that he would send a waiter. I was waiting for quite a while (didn't time it, but too long).  I noticed a couple arrived, sat down, and a waiter immediately went to their table and took their order.  He was tall, had an accent and was left-handed, which I noticed because I'm also a lefty.  I say this so that perhaps a manager reading this will identify him and speak to him in order to improve.
I almost walked out, but another waiter came to serve me.  Perhaps because I was alone, they thought I wasn't as important to serve.  A couple of years ago, I also received inferior service to those around me, I feel because I was alone.  This wasn't the case many years ago.

As far as the food, the Sea Bass with chipotle sauce that I had  was excellent.  However, to make the experience enjoyable, as it should be,
the service needs major improvement.
Other reviewers have stated this need just recently on Trip Advisor, etc.
The management should take note and make improvements.< /text>

Good selection of food. Fresh bread. Good service. One of the managers, Ferry or something like that, can't stop touching her face and nose and then touching the plates and catchup/hot sauce bottles. Very unhygienic. Though we enjoyed the restaurant, her touching the plates and general unfriendly attitude took away from the experience.<//Text>

Good food, great view of the Pacific.  Good coffee and good service. The prices of their croissants are very high. I purchased 2 croissants and they changed me $10. The croissants are very soft , not crispy at all.<//Review>

We walked in by chance after finding a parking spot in front of their shop. Went in for a drink and was met with a VERY knowledgeable & capable bar tender named Steven! Over the next few hours we ate some of the tastiest garlic bread and down right delectable mixed drinks! Steven knows his trade well! We enjoyed our visit and atmosphere so much we went back the next night. We were again greeted by kind staff and had the lobster bisque soup among other appetizers. FABULOUS! VERY positive experience here!!< /review>

This is a well-known French bakery in downtown Laguna Beach a long time. The restaurant part is casual, and the foods are nice. It is not as good if you need to impress someone. 5 stars are for the bakery.< /text>

We sat on their Patio for breakfast on Sunday. The place was NOT busy, but 10 min after we sat down, we still didn’t have menus. My wife asked a waiter if we could have a menu, but he just kept walking.
Another waiter walked by and I asked.
He kept walking as well. I got up and he turned and told me that they’ll bring us menu as soon as they can.
They were rude and disrespectful. We just got up and had breakfast at Moulin. Much better choice, and actually French.</text>

<Text>French type menu with good crepes, both savory and sweet. Salade Nicoise was good but obviously made by someone who might not have ever had one. It had a tasty but not Nicoise dressing among other faux pas. Fresh tuna was nicely seared but coated with some awful seasoning. Mojito had plenty of mint but NO rum! Service was good and ocean/beach views were pleasant.</Text><rating>3</rating></record>

View is amazing, but unfortunately the food isnt that great. They forgot to add any dressing to our salad, and it didnt even taste good. Burger came in toast bread, and peach tart was dense, dry, and all the possible opposite pronouns of what a custard should taste like. Even the coffee we ordered was cold. So I’m not sure if its just a place to get juices/cold drinks.</text>

OK food, good service beautiful view.
Tim/ James was awesome. The mimosa was better than bloody Mary. We've had several variations of egg Benedict, they were all just average. Pastries were fresh.
If I go back, I'd ask for my potatoes to be crispy</review>

I was very impressed with C'est La Vie. The restaurant is very charming with the upstairs outside patio and view of the ocean.  We arrived just in time for happy hour.  Service was great. The bartender/waiter Tony was very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable about wines.  We had a great time and looking forward to coming back soon.</Text>

First impression was a very cute and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. But the hostess and the busser were arguing about where my boyfriend and I should be seated. They were both telling us to sit at different tables.

The food wasn't absolutely terrible. I'm sure the crepes are good. But I didn't get a crepe. I ordered an omelette. It was supposed to be a southwestern-style spicy omelette, but what they brought me was the avocado and bacon omelette. Which I didn't really complain about because I was actually considering ordering that one, but it was very undercooked and watery inside. It was pretty gross. It was also confusing because two different people came to take our order at different times. The iced mocha was okay, but a little chalky.

What I did love was the violin guy walking around the dining room. He stopped at our table and played for a long time. Which was sweet and kinda romantic-y, but I guess we just weren't really sure how to act (should we just watch him play and smile, continue talking to each other, etc.) or if it was appropriate to tip him.

Overall it was a bit of a disappoinment and we felt a little like we had wasted our time and money 🙁 It probably could have been better, but that wasn't our experience.< /Review>

<text>French type menu with good crepes, both savory and sweet. Salade Nicoise was good but obviously made by someone who might not have ever had one. It had a tasty but not Nicoise dressing among other faux pas. Fresh tuna was nicely seared but coated with some awful seasoning. Mojito had plenty of mint but NO rum! Service was good and ocean/beach views were pleasant.<//text><GmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02<//GmapID>< Time>

Great food and amazing service. Manuel was one of the best, if not the best, waiters I have ever had. It was cold outside so I asked for the half of my soup I had not eaten to be heated up. He brought me a brand new soup. The crepes are incredible!</review>

<Date>1555458114094<//Date><Text>I was visiting my friend in Alico Viejo.  Yesterday, April 16, we went to this restaurant that she liked before.    Place is nice, bakery look wonderful.  I am vegetarian and new that French restaurants are not really vegetarian friendly.  but place looked nice and we decided to give it a shot.  In a FEW minutes waiter approached us and before we looked at food menu I asked about sweets, in case we like it and have something with wine instead of meal.  he quickly brought us sample tray, which looked amazing, but unfortunately most of the dessert had jello glazing on it and we said its OK we do not want it.  HE Disappeared  for at least 7 minutes.  we started looked around and waived for attention, when other person noticed that and asked our waiter if those ladies are needing an attention. "no, - he said - they asked for more time".  WE NEVER DID.  He got back to our table.  we asked for a salad and wine.  He DISAPPEARED for another 8 minutes, NO WINE, NO WATER FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES OF WAITING.  WE ARE RUSSIAN AND SPEAK WITH ACCENT.  IS THAT WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE?  WE LEFT.
THE ONLY THING I REGRET THAT I DID NOT GIVE HIM A TIP FOR HIS SERVICE: A PENNY THAT HE DESERVES.
I am not going to blame everybody in this restaurant, but one stinking rut that walls into honey barrel spoils it all.
I have plans to move to this area and hope this place will have friendlier attitude</Text>< username>

<text>Impeccable food. Every visit has been a wonderful experience. All the staff is very friendly and will always go the extra mile to make you satisfied with your visit.

EVERYTHING you can eat here is amazing, do not be scared to try anything that catches your eye and always get a cronut.< /text>< pictures>

I visited this place for take out on 14th July 2019. There were only two people in front of me, but it took over 10 minutes to get served. But, to be fair, the guy was on his own most of that time and one of the customers was a pain.

I thought $17.50 for two chocolate croissants and two cronuts was a bit expensive.  However, they were tasty and I've wanted to try a cronut for a long time.< /text>

The food is mediocre. Most of it was either pre-made earlier that day or was once frozen or canned. Nothing seemed fresh, and the prices are ridiculous considering what you get. I expected way more from a place that charged $18 for a burger and toted themselves as a "French Bistro".

Even their desserts were brought in from somewhere else.

The only thing that saved them a star was the super friendly hostess, or possible manager, who was super friendly. You could tell she had a lot going on and she was a total rockstar running the restaurant side and jumping to the "bakery" side helping out where she could.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>My husband and I went there for breakfast on Sunday 5/29/16. My husband ordered scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and I ordered crepe with scrambled eggs then we had cronuts for dessert. Everything was delicious and amazing. We loved the food, the seating and the service. People were nice and courteous even though it was busy. I asked for hot milk instead of half and half and the waiter brought it in minutes. Only thing I noticed they forgot to bring the bread in the beginning and the waiter apologized and brought it with the food.</Text><resp>None</resp>< user_name>

We came here with family for a late lunch. The boy at the bakery was very friendly and welcoming. We got seated. We decided to have a cup of coffee at the beginning and as they have a big coffee variety we asked servers couple questions. And.... He was so rude. My daughter asked what kind of drinks they have for kids and he  raised his voice on her and I couldnt believe my ears!!!! We never had this experience before! We left the menus, stood up and we left this terrible place! Not even tried their food. But looking to the reviews we did not missed anything!</Review>

All the food was served cold, including my coffee (Cafe au Lait), in which I waited for hot milk which was served 10 mins later than the coffee- obviously the coffee got cold. It was the fourth of July but none of the other waiters seemed to have an issue, ours was MIA from the start- two other tables sat down after us and got waited on AND served first. Generally unacceptable for anywhere trying to convey an even slightly professional/upscale environment. Would not recommend to anyone.<//Review>

<Text>It's a nice place for breakfast.  Nice view of the ocean from the patio seating.  The coffee is very good, which is very important for a breakfast place. They just have to do a better job on their croissants. It is a French cafe with croissants similar to a market packaged soft croissants. I suggest the owners try croissants at an Erewhon  market. Overall a good place to go. I go there often.</Text><Date>1498919908573</Date><Name>Jahansooz Jomehri< /Name><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02<//gmapID>< response>

my mother and I were looking for a place to eat that was by the ocean, and we figured that this place would be perfect! French cuisine, right by the ocean, what could be better? Wrong. Although the view was nice and the staff was competent, the food was terrible! Greasy, bland, and entirely underwhelming. I got the ratatouille crepe, and it was practically a plate of oil and some vegetables. This restaurant has an incredible location, wish they could step up their "French cuisine."</Review>

We had a credit voucher to use at this restaurant so we have it a shot one evening. The view from the upstairs patio is great, especially at sunset. Sadly that was best part of the evening. The food was good, however it was not great. And our server was slow. Three other tables were seated after we arrived and left before we had received our check. The staff is really friendly though, so if you are not in any rush, it could be ok. The deciding factor for us not to return was the price of the desserts. The macaroons are $2.45 each. Our desserts, chocolate cheesecake and a tiramisu we just under $12 each. Again, both were good, but not rave worthy.<//Text>

Lovely atmosphere to this French restaurant.  Outdoor seating with heat lamps warmed the cool desert evening  for a fantastic dining experience watching the sunset.  The crab stuffed mushrooms were a savory delight.

The waiter's service was excellent.<//Review>

Many years back, my mom and I ate here on the fly--it was fabulous. The service was lovely and so was the coffee. A few years later I remembered this place when a friend of mine was getting married on the beach The manager was SO accommodating--she allowed me to come in  prior to the ceremony and reserve a long table with an amazing view. I brought in fresh flowers and place settings for each seat to surprise the couple and a small group of guests for their post ceremony dinner here. The manager was amazingly sweet and helpful, and from what I hear, the meal was superb. I never got to go back in and say thank you; I have since moved out of state. I will make it a point to eat here on my next visit to Laguna.< /review>

Overall, I have to tip my hat to C'est la Vie for putting on one stellar dining experience especially for my awesome friend's birthday.  From start to finish, they were on point from the get go.  The service was outstanding, the ambiance and décor was lovely.  The dishes were all incredible with everything tasting amazing.  It exceeded my expectations for sure.  100/10 says I will return.  Definitely worth the money!!  Make a reservation asap!!<//text>

<text>I really enjoyed my dish of the pasta mamma. I thought it was light yet hearty in a delicious, satisfying way. There wasn't too much Alfredo sauce, there was the perfect amount of eggs, bacon and the tomatoes on top sealed the deal. Absolutely delicious.

I tried the banana foster crepe which was sweet and satisfying as well. The view if you choose outside seating is gorgeous and I enjoyed eying their decor.

What brought down the rating for this place was the waiter. I'd hate to put so much emphasis on the staff, because we're there to eat. However, I feel that waiters/waitresses/ hostesses do make a difference. In this case, it was our waiter. The host who helped us to our table was very sweet and polite upon arriving and departing.

For starters, the waiter did not supply us with any bread. Everyone around us received it, except us until we asked for it. He took our order, then later returned with our food. Now we were celebrating my friends birthday, who specifically told us we had to try her sweet potato fries when they arrived. She told us before she even ordered it, as she was the only one who had been to this establishment before. The waiter then appeared with the food and asked if everything looked okay. The birthday girl mentioned she had ordered sweet potato fries, not the fries she was given. He immediately got defensive and said "you said steak fries." She said okay it's alright I will eat them. He then asked if she would like potato fries and she said no thank you. She was clearly upset. He said "are you sure?" as if he was annoyed. I jumped in and said yes, she would like her sweet potato fries.

This in my opinion was unacceptable. This could've been easily labeled as a miscommunication and resolved. First, apologize to the customer and then politely inform them you will correct the order and bring them out as soon as possible. It's really not that hard. He was just a bad waiter over all and really brought down the mood.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Two good dishes on a Sunday diner.  But big mistake was NOT asking about specials.  Table over order what looked to be massive bone on rib-eye steaks.  Very jealous.  Next trip for sure to order.  My salmon grill was excellent.  Wifes dish was average - was to be spicy but really nothing and I believe they had wrong sort of sausage in the dish - polish vs italian which would have been better (garlic in polish overshadowed dish, whereas a chili-based italian would have sparked it -- IMHO).  Good overall.  BTW, servered hers dish on a large plate which should have been a bowl to keep temp up - front line should have caught mis-plating.  Oh well not Michelin star'd .< /Review><Response>None< /Response><name>Greg W<//name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

<Text>The eggs florentine are their best dish, wont vouge for anything else. I first ate here 14 years ago, the eggs florentine were really good, then for a while they were average. Last time I ate there a month ago they were the best ever! Cheers to the new chef. Service is sometimes slow, the views are amazing.  They're busy usually, it's in a prime location. Coffee is good too. They're nice people here.<//Text><username>Daniel Mohammadi<//username><date>1549635203056</date>< Pictures>

<review>Great food. My only complaint is that there seems to be a serious fly problem. We walked in and saw flies. Sat down and flies were all around us. When we were served bread, a fly landed on it. But thats my only issues. Food was amazing. Fix the fly problem and it gets 5 stars</review>< rating>

Terrible experience. The meal took 25 minute from ordering time. They brought the wrong entree and it was grossly over cooked. The waiter told me that a large crow had come in after us and they had first priority. On exit, the manager  made a similar excuse. Terrible.<//review>

We had eaten here one year ago but it was clear the ownership cut back on the number of servers. They were overloaded but still smiled to their credit. I also got RITZ CRACKERS for my fruit and cheese tray. Unbelievable.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><text>I rarely review anywhere but I had to for this. We complained about the food and the manager under his breath said I hope you choke on it. I have let everyone know in Laguna Beach about these con-artists who can not even cook. So so ill the next day all of our party were really sick with Staph poisoning and my daughter was one week in hospital vomiting her guts out. This is not in the least bit French. Our food was cold and microwaved prepackaged food made to look fancy. The taste was revolting. The management are not even French but Iranian Arabs.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02</gmap_id></record>

The only reason I went 4 instead of 5 stars is I have been there when they were busy and my meal was served cool. I will conclude that when they are on point the items I tried were remarkable.</review>< date>

Terrible...just awful.  For starters, I had to use the men's room because the ladies room was...overflowing.  Yum.  Next, the service here is TERRIBLE!  Waited forever for menus, forever for our drinks.  Finally got up and went to another restaurant .  Save your money....not even French anyway .</text>

I don't usually do restaurant reviews, but this place was truly terrible!!!! My friend and I were looking for a place to relax and to study. It was empty, and the busboy (who was very nice) told us we were welcome to have a cup of coffee and study since the restaurant was empty. The waiter, however, was very rude and made us feel extremely uncomfortable; he constantly tried to push us to buy more food and to buy alcoholic drinks, and then made snide remarks under his breath about us being cheap when we said no thank you. The food was terrible!!!! He gave us dry, stale bread, but the busboy was nice enough to get us something a little fresher. The food that we ordered was really salty and not very fresh looking, and the dipping sauces looked gross and smelled funky. Then he charged us $30 for a single appetizer and two coffees. We didn't even get a refill for our coffee because he left for a smoke break and was gone for a while. The menu said that the appetizer was only $10 and that the coffee was $3, but he said that was his "special" rate with a really mean smile. ***It is not worth the nice view to go here; please don't support these people after they bullied and ripped us off***< /Text>

It was fabulous! Côtes d'agneau cooked to perfection, beef filet mignon with roquefort sauce delightful and penne à la provençale pasta with ratatouille and goat cheese yummy! And for dessert: Napoleon, as good as the millefeuille en France. Bravo!<//review>

We walked in and the place was almost empty (as if a warning sign). I didn't want to eat there, so we just checked out the bakery in front. All the desserts looked so appetizing and delectable, but to my mistake i was completely wrong. We asked the gentleman for the fruit tart and he said he would throw in a "free" slice of the cheesecake with that since we purchased the whole cake. i thought he was so kind for that until he came back with our change. the total turned out to be over $40 and he refused to give us a receipt. when we finally got some kind of slip of paper, he avoided us as we walked out angrily. we knew something sneaky was going on here. when we arrived home, the top layer of the cake was delicious, but once i tasted the bottom crust, it was so stale and just ruined my appetite. the cheesecake, however, was okay. i couldn't believe this had just happened, we got ripped off for a digusting dessert and i will never eat here again. DO NOT EVER WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!</text>

Not sure how to feel about this place. Arrived to an early Valentine's day dinner and were offered anywhere to sit by young man at bar. We chose a table with ocean view. We were told to please move to a smaller table adjacent to that table because the table by window was reserved for a larger party. We abided. Service was great by our server. Very attentive. Food was very good. We noticed during our meal, another couple came in and were told the same thing as us....they could sit anywhere they'd like. They looked around, like we did earlier, and chose the exact same table with ocean view. They were escorted to table. They were also a party of 2. They were not told to move (they didn't have reservation). I dont know why we were not allowed to stay at that table and they were. It was our 26th anniversary, chose this place over ALL our choices in Laguna. We chose to eat an early dinner to beat the crowds and maybe get an ocean view. We felt very uncomfortable during our meal because of this. Again, our server was awesome, the cioppino was great and we bought a few desserts at the front little bakery to take home, the young girl helping us was great. We actually ended up eating our cheesecake slice we bought there, instead of waiting till we got back to our hotel. Our server was gracious enough to bring us plates and forks. Just got a feeling we weren't very welcomed there by the way we were treated by that bartender/young man. We tried to still have a romantic dinner. Was a little difficult as we could hear the couple next to us admire the ocean view, that we had, out loud. Would have been a 5 star experience. How does one take that?<//Review>

<Review>Service was terrible. Chicken sandwich was cheap white bread and a thin layer of chicken breast. Salad came out with no dressing. Just pile of leaves on a plate next to a sub par chicken sandwich. Had to flag down a busboy to get the dressing for my salad. Server made up for it with free dessert, however, dessert was soggy and nasty. Expected A LOT more for the price.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I remember coming here a couple years back and really the quality of food and service wasn't the greatest.  I have been hearing good things about the change in management so went here again recently and tried the prime hanger steak paired with it with the red bordeaux (a recommendation from staff) which was awesome!  They have really stepped up their game around here!!!! Now, not only is the venue wonderful but the food and service are on the same playing field.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

the view was marvellous!the service crew are attentive however, the food is disgusting!we ordered burger and fish n chips and the tiny fish was rolled in a greasy crust.the burger looks good but taste bland.the only thing that taste good is their pepsi...the crew always check on you if your food taste good to a point that its annoying coz you dont want to hurt their feelings on the spot.< /Review>

Quite expensive. Really nice view, but the coffee was not up to French standards and the macarons were just ok< /review>

I have been hearing good things about the change in management so went here again recently and tried the prime hanger steak paired with it with the red bordeaux (a recommendation from staff) which was awesome!  They have really stepped up their game around here!!!! Now, not only is the venue wonderful but the food and service are on the same playing field.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<name>Yvette Lopez<//name><text>Not sure how to feel about this place. Arrived to an early Valentine's day dinner and were offered anywhere to sit by young man at bar. We chose a table with ocean view. We were told to please move to a smaller table adjacent to that table because the table by window was reserved for a larger party. We abided. Service was great by our server. Very attentive. Food was very good. We noticed during our meal, another couple came in and were told the same thing as us....they could sit anywhere they'd like. They looked around, like we did earlier, and chose the exact same table with ocean view. They were escorted to table. They were also a party of 2. They were not told to move (they didn't have reservation). I dont know why we were not allowed to stay at that table and they were. It was our 26th anniversary, chose this place over ALL our choices in Laguna. We chose to eat an early dinner to beat the crowds and maybe get an ocean view. We felt very uncomfortable during our meal because of this. Again, our server was awesome, the cioppino was great and we bought a few desserts at the front little bakery to take home, the young girl helping us was great. We actually ended up eating our cheesecake slice we bought there, instead of waiting till we got back to our hotel. Our server was gracious enough to bring us plates and forks. Just got a feeling we weren't very welcomed there by the way we were treated by that bartender/young man. We tried to still have a romantic dinner. Was a little difficult as we could hear the couple next to us admire the ocean view, that we had, out loud. Would have been a 5 star experience. How does one take that?< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I wish I could give them a negative star. We went there with the family on 01/01/2016. Seated almost immediately and decided to leave right after talking to the waiter. I didn't care about his stitches on his eyebrow or banged up face but his attitude and short answers and " I don't wanna be here" attitude was almost as disgusting as the restaurant. On the way out the manager or owner also pushed my daughter out of her way, saying "move"  she is lucky her face didn't end up matching the waiter. Don't waste ur time. Go somewhere else. Hopefully they close down or change management soon.</Review>< Pictures>

The food was great and the staffs are friendly. The restarant is super tiny and cute. But the price wasnt friendly. One chicken leg costs almost $ 30 dollars. Haha. But worth trying ! I highly recommend their onion soup! Four plates were charged over $100 not including the tip.<//Review>

One of my favorite spots for weekend brunch. It has a patio upstairs that overlooks Laguna Beach. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Their bread is delicious. I usually get the huevos rancheros, though it is a lot of food. They also have mojo potatoes with many of their breakfasts, which are yummy.

The bakery is also very good. I have not eaten here for dinner because it is quite expensive, but I imagine it's very good.<//review>

They screwed up our reservations and the service was extremely slow in fact they forgot one of our orders and took an extra 10 to 15 minutes to bring it to us so we were all done eating when the last person got their order. Never checked to see if we wanted refills. Very disappointing for supposedly a high-end restaurant.< /Review>

We had a reservation for 630 and the host told us that the reservations did not matter because they had too many walk ins.. So we waited over and hour to sit down.. Then we waited over an hour at our table and still no server came to us once.. Every table was complaining that their food was cold, dry and chewy and other tables complained that they had not received there food in over 2 hours, so we took the hint and left. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and I am not that picky. This truly was the worst experience and I would honestly stay away from this restaurant.<//Text>

I loved this place!  For the price, it's sooooo much better than many of the restaurants around here.  And the food was amazing!  I had the Sea Bass and Bread Pudding.  Two of my favorites and they both were incredible!  And my server, Brittany, was very kind, extremely knowledgable about the food, and very timely as she checked on me.  (I'll request her again when I eat here.)

And who can beat the view????  I watched the sunset over the ocean.  Oh my goodness!  What an amazing evening.  I'll come here again... hope you'll give it a chance too...</Text>

It was great to have the lunch on the patio, we had a really nice time in this restaurant. I had a great ahi ahi niçoise salad, my wife had the croque monsieur (lots of meat inside, ham or turkey, I don't remember), and my in-laws took the beef filet mignon and fish and chips. All plates were tasty and well prepared.
The raspberry cheesecake was also really good. Espresso was also really good, reminded me the ones I used to have in France.
Also, I thought that the prices were in acceptable range with several plates for less than $20.
The only thing that I did not like was the Walnut tart. I was expecting a crunchier one but had a 'soft' one.</Text>

Worst restaurant in town. Restaurant was empty and after 30 minutes we decided to leave since they didn’t pass by to ask for our order. Neither water was served. We complained to the restaurant manager and they didn’t care.<//Text>

Not sure where to start. It seemed like one thing after another went wrong. Food was very disappointing, service was awful. Our waiter was also our bartender, and made the worst margarita I’ve ever had, I think he forgot the sweet and sour or lime, just tasted like ice blended with tequila. Then he made a snide comment when I sent it back. My kids all ordered crepes off of the adult menu, which were ok, not great, but they were supposed to come with a scoop of ice cream, which they didn’t. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said they ran out, and offered a macaroon instead, but first  tried to sneak it by us without our noticing.

Apparently our orders were on separate tickets from my kids’, because after delivering the kids food We could hear the waiter yelling at the chef for not making the rest, and showing him the missing ticket. By the time we got our food, my kids were almost done eating.

My seafood quiche was decent, but not great. My wife had filet mignon crepe, which was good but way too much sauce and the filet was over cooked.

After all this the waiter adds automatic gratuity, and points out that he did us a favor by only doing 18% because the it’s normally 20%. So I look over the handwritten bill, and notice they overcharged each of the crepe dishes by $2 each. He fixed the bill, and gave us a card for $10 off our next visit.....  hahaha. Like that would ever happen.

Oh yeah, and there’s no air conditioning. The day we visited was 100degrees and it was uncomfortably warm inside the entire meal.

If I’m going to spend $191 on lunch, I expect good food, great service, and a comfortable atmosphere. This place had none of the above. Don’t waste your money</Review>

We usually have a good experience but this time was awful. The service was less than standard and you shouldn't have to ask three times for drinks and bread. Don't keep apologizing if you don't mean it. Not sure if we will go back.<//review>

<review>The food at C'est La Vie was very special.. 5 star. I ordered simple, a Tuna Salad sandwich on rye and was I ever surprised. The sandwich was delicious, the bread was fantastic (light and great texture), then they served a pasta salad (which came with it). Best pasta salad I have ever had.

I met and congratulated the cook (Daniel), he happened to come out of the kitchen for a short time. Additionally, the waitstaff was great and the atmosphere is pleasant.

They also have a great patio overlooking Main Beach Park and the ocean. I love this place.

Note: I would give C'est La Vie a 5 star review  except the manager was very rude (before this writing I asked several people about the restaurant and the young manager (35 ish); every single one said he is rude), This manager certainly could work on his friendliness and be more professional with his customers. On the otherhand, the owner is an older man, he and his sister were very nice. Should be 5 Stars for sure!

This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and I am not that picky. This truly was the worst experience and I would honestly stay away from this restaurant.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We always enjoy their French Onion Soup and they have some good sandwhiches.  Good views if you want to sit by PCH and people watch or sit ocean side to hear the waves.  At our last visit, the service was not the best, we were constantly looking for our Server to get more coffee, condiments, out bill.  We will give them one more chance before we go somewhere else.  Lots of options on PCH in the area.<//Text>

Chicken was not cooked throughout, and the restaurant was not even busy! Spoke with the Manager. Hoped my friend would not get sick from eating the uncooked chicken.< /Review>

<Text>We had to get up from our table to get someone to wait on us and to get the check too. Someone told us that our designated waiter had just quit. They took forever to bring my credit card back and a couple of days after that my CC was cloned and used to make purchases at a jewelry store several times within days. If you had your CC cloned after visiting this place let me know.< /Text></record>

<Review>My friend and I tried C'est La Vie, yesterday for dinner, using a Travelzoo voucher.  We were not sure what to expect after reading the reviews.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  The manager was very attentive and made sure the server was told about us as soon as we sat down.  He came by several times during the meal to make sure everything was to our liking.

We sat on the covered part of the outside patio.  The forecast had been for rain, but the sun came out.  It was lovely and very comfortable.

Our server was very attentive to us as well as were all the other servers as they walked by---taking empty dishes and filling our water glasses, etc..

The food was delicious!  We had Jumbo Mushrooms with crab for an appetizer.  I had Sea Bass and he had Seafood Fettuccine for the main course.  My friend is from NYC and we have not found any restaurant in OC that he considers as having very good food.  This is the first restaurant that we have found  that he said has very good food!!!

The food is pricey as it is in most French restaurants. Because we were using a Travelzoo voucher, we were very pleased with our experience in every way!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I can say that divine intervention appeared before me when glorious beef bourguignon from the Friday french night menu, prepared in an entirely new way (to me), at my command, paired with a deliciously-bodied EnRoute Far Niente.

Prime steak and chops night. Fearsome words only rivaled by "ecstasy" and "heaven" - these are the descriptive modifiers that transformed my evening from the mundane to.... a trip to C'est la Vie.

From perfected dishes presented in front and a wise sommelier filling my glass from behind, I was regaled with tales of truth, and, (I hope) fantastical myth describing the origins of my meal.

Excellence was demonstrated in my presence and I couldn't be more satiated, body and soul.</review>< username>

<Text>Great location, beautiful ocean views right on the Main Beach in Laguna. Breakfast was excellent, pancakes, eggs benedict all cooked to perfection. Potatoes were golden and crispy. Wonderfully fresh French bread on the side! Even the huevos rancheros were good for a French restaurant, served on a quesadilla base. Service a tad slow but friendly. Now to try some delicious macaroons and Cronuts from the bakery on the way out!</Text>< Pictures>

Come for the seating next to beach, but don't come for the food. Took my wife here for her birthday and we were expecting French cuisine. The menu is French enough having many of the traditional items. I ordered a Ahi Tartarte for appetizer and it was underwhelming both in looks and taste, not to mention the brown, spotted avocados.

For our entree, wife had the Canard A L'Orange and I had the Entrecote with the ubiquitous peppercorn creme sauce. The duck was soggy and overcooked, tasted like day(s) old food. My ribeye was a fat, sloppy cut, a bit undercooked, but the sauce was a sweet, tangy mess with no peppercorns anywhere. It felt like the chef cooks whatever/however he wanted and haven't read the menu. We were so disappointed with the food we didn't even finish it and decided to pay and leave.

The service was decent enough, but will not be coming back nor recommend any friends to come.<//Review>

My wife and I ate dinner at C'est La Vie on Monday February 8, 2010.  The meal was excellent, reasonably priced and complimented by courteous staff and our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.

We had walked down from our hotel (which had recommended the restaurant), we had the half price bottle of wine with our meal as we understand in California it is OK to Drink and Walk and there was no pressure on us to drink up and leave!

We took dessert back to the hotel with us from their bakery as we were agreeably stuffed!

I had read the mixed reviews before we went and as the negative ones were largely emotional rants and not objectively qualified, both my wife and I are pleased that we ignored them.

It appears the previous reviewer Devo's guest/date/spouse should be pleased if not relieved that they didn't give him a second beer as Valentine's Day is the 14th not the 13th!<//Text>

This is not my first time here, just my first review. Very satisfied with the food, most food on their menu, but service can be slow at times. A place you can't argue with waiting with the view of the ocean and Catalina island.< /Review>

Tourist trap with a very odd menu. I would go to Moulin for some real French food and parties.</Review>

(Translated by Google) That's a real French corner in Laguna Beach. The food was very delicious, served with a big smile and more. The decoration of the place is authentic, which gives the place a special cachet in full tourist place. Prices are very affordable for the city of Laguna Beach. I recommend it deliciously!

Je recommende délicieusement !</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant of food and sweet French style. The food is good however I did not have a good experience of their customer service. They are slow to leave the table ready, in ordering you and in general I could be more professional in the service since it is of French style they could honor the culture Culinary of that country. Anyway there are beautiful sea views from the terrace where you can eat outdoors in front of the beach. Good luck.

Es un restaurante de comida y dulceria estilo francés. La comida es buena sin embargo  no tuve una buena experiencia de su servicio al cliente.Demoran para dejar lista la mesa,en hacerte el pedido y en general podría ser más profesional en el servicio ya q es de estilo francés  podrían hacerle honor a la cultura culinaria de ese pais.De todas maneras hay bellísimas vistas al mar desde la terraza donde se puede comer al aire libre frente a la playa. Buena suerte.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
