Best shop in town. Don't waste your time going anywhere else.
Big box store tire shops don't even know the difference between white and black wall rubber.</Text>

Excellent customer service I’m a senior citizen and went to other places to have someone check my tire pressure and no one would do it I pulled into auburn tire and and a service rep came right out and asked how he could help. I told him my issue and he said let me check that for you right away. I was back on the road less than five minutes thank you thank you for the excellent customer service<//review>

<Time>1608366395988</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>The front desk members are quick, concise, and polite; price quoted was below a number of other businesses I've been to in recent years. They were adept at their ability to navigate the different needs and personalities of a wide range of folks coming and going while I was waiting in the lobby. It was quaint inside, not my style, but tidied and comfortable in the short to mid term.

Actual work on vehicle was efficient, well described, and tight upon driving. They didn't time bantering, but were polite in the bowing out to get back to work. Great attitudes all around.

5/5 would recommend.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x809b1ab3a7c62ad1:0xea4453b50e0c825d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Place is amazing, very clean office.
The help was amazing and very professional all the employees where a great help and very kind.
I stopped by to have some trailer tires mounted on new wheels, they where knowledgeable to make sure I had the proper rating on my wheels and the proper valve stem. They care about your safety and well-being.
Their pricing is extremely fair and work is quick and on point.
If Auburn tire reads this review it was a pleasure speaking with you about randomness in the office thank you again for your help.< /Review>

They mounted a 4 ply tractor tire that I was fighting. Apparently LS bends the rim and pounds it back. These guys were recommended by Ophir Tractor. They were very busy but super nice and got me in and out quickly. I will get all of my tires here from now on.<//Review>

< Review>
They are friendly, efficient, and have excellent taste in tires. My only note is that I was charged a small amount more than I would be if I went online to Tire Rack and picked an installer. That said, my powder coat is in the same condition as I brought it, they told me to come back if I have any TPMS issues or other trouble, and they do tire rotations as part of the package. Not to mention the whole process took less than an hour, including a delay while I removed junk from my trunk.

No complaints, definitely coming back again.<//Review>

Driving through Auburn on our way to Boise we had a tire warning light come on. We pulled off the highway and found Auburn Tire. Jeff and his crew helped us out right away, checked and inflated our tires and gave us some great advice and got us back on the road quickly! Highly recommend!</Review>

So these people are super, super sweet people. I brought it in to have my front end aligned, and even though I was charged (I mean they did have to put it on their machine to check) they we're honest to tell me no alignment was needed so I did not waste money. I wish they would have asked before rotating my tires, but otherwise they are really great people!<//review>

I took my f250 in for new tires its a company vehicles and we go through a fleet service. If you know anything about Fleet Services they don't want to actually fix your truck then you know they would rather keep the money. than keep you safe! but the girls at the front desk fought very hard for over an hour to get me better tires then I'm approved for because they knew the surrounding areas that I work in required a better Tire. I'm am bad with names so my apologies, but they didn't have to do this as they make very little money off one jackass fleet vehicle, case-in-point  they were willing to buy the tires but not willing to pay the labor so I got my people involved on my end and All was resolved (so I will be going back there on Friday to purchase tires for my personal truck where they're giving me a good deal but more than the deal I'm getting customer service which most people don't even know what that's about thanks again Auburn Tire service.

Service, service, service is all I  can say about these guys. I called 4 different shops in Auburn for a quote, 3 never bothered to call me back. Scott gave me a quote, when I  called. Great service, friendly and knowledgeable. They even offered a ride home, and to pick me up when my truck was ready. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Needing a rear tire for a John Deere 100 series mower, I showed up at the store at 8:10 am and not only was there a  replacement tire in stock but it was mounted on the rim right away and I was out the door by 8:35!  What a pleasant experience.</Text>

<review>Great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I had them do 7 tires (4 on my jeep, 1 spare, and two for my jeep trailer). Very knowledgeable and a great price. Found me two matching wheels for my trailer and had them there that afternoon. BEST tire buying experience ever. I enjoyed not having to put up with the "UPSALE" of the chain tire stores or the incompetence of a couiple other area tire shops i have been to in the past.</review><userid>113948646841413668795</userid><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

On an emergency basis, (without stating so) I called at 4:50 on a  December Thursday evening with a front brake problem...the disc brakes on my truck were scraping on the rotors.   Just worn out.   I need my truck for work.
They took me in the next morning and serviced my Ford F-150  by turning the front rotors that had 107000 miles on them  and installed  new OEM front disc pads.   Jeff did a great job performing the service work and my truck now tracks straighter and stops better -like new.
I view this shop's quote, service and repair as honest and fair, while being quite efficient.  Especially because they did not try to up-sell me on things not really needed at this time,,and that shows concern for the customer's pocketbook.   Once diagnosed, I was notified of the problem and options, then was able to make an informed decision for the repair.  Very satisfied with this transaction, and will plan on purchasing tires from them in the future.< /Text>

<Review>Raul’s Shack On Encinitas Boulevard

Rauls is one of my favorite places to eat when I’m looking for Mexican food. I appreciate the small setting and place to sit outside and enjoy your food. The food is always of great quality and they provide multiple vegetarian options. There is no lack in variety including tacos enchiladas and quesadillas including my favorite the bean cheese burrito. A good choice of sauces and salsa also freshens up the meal. The people taking your order are always friendly and looking to help. Grabbing some food from Raul’s and spending some time on the beach is a very good idea and you should consider trying it sometime.</Review><user_name>Akshay Bhatia</user_name>< time>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Tiny over priced burritos that were mostly Tortilla. California burrito had the tiniest sprinkling of carne asada. Mostly just sour cream. There are so many better choices nearby. Other than the cool shack vibe there isn't anything going for it. Maybe the food that isn't a burrito is good.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dc0c42ff9776cb:0xe18d04ad8ee3485b</GmapID></record>

I sent my friends to this place with my highest recommendations. I visit this place often. This recommendation is always successful. The meals are great and the team is efficient and cooperative. Every time  we go to this place we pass a pleasant evening.  I recommend this place with pleasure.</Text>

<review>My favorite Mexican place in San Diego. It takes me about 30 minutes to get to Encinitas, but I drive there at least once a month just to get Raul's. It's the California dream: a small shack owned by a Mexican family who keep everything simple but delicious. I have gotten a California Burrito there every time and it always makes my day.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

They don’t list all the ingredients on the menu for each item. Carne Nachos are listed with cheese and guacamole and I said no guacamole and it came with sour cream and Pico de Gallo. They need to list ALL the ingredients on each item. Plus there nachos come with a supple amount of cheese compared to other places, I would NOT recommend..<//text>

<Text>This place is incredible, the food, the prices, and the kind people, are unbeatable. I have tried all the Mexican restaurants in encintas and this stands out. Some of our favorite iteams are the bean and cheese burrito, beef and bean burrito, fish burrito, and tortilla soup. Not once have I ever left unsatisfied.<//Text></record>

<Text>I remember coming here many years ago during a blackout and it was the only place open. They cook on a gas stove. Super good burritos, great service (sometimes slow) and well worth it. Can't beat the location either. 3 minute walk to D Street and Moonlight beaches. Great for a post-water meal.<//Text>< date>

This place is a must when you’re visiting this awesome beach town.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc0c42ff9776cb:0xe18d04ad8ee3485b<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Better than Filiberto's, but that isn't hard. Burritos are too small. Raul's has been there forever, but the Taco Stand is much better, and it isn't even that great. Might seem good if you've been trapped in NorCal and don't know the difference.

Edit: changed from two stars to one after it nuked stomach.< /Text>< name>

<Review>I had a veggie burrito a few years ago and it was okay. Today I had the carne asada street tacos and a chicken street taco. They were both good. My kids got the nachos, which were delicious. My daughter made the mistake of getting no sour cream, which we all decided was a bad plan. My son got carne asada on his and liked it. There are only five tables (three inside and two outside), but even at lunch time it wasn't crowded as it seems that most people take their food to-go. The prices are reasonable, so I'm not sure why some folks were complaining that they are too expensive. The workers were friendly enough.</Review><Rating>4</Rating><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

It's more like 3.5 stars. Burritos are a little smaller and the prices are a little steeper than I would like.

But all in all its a fine burritos. Just need to either be bigger or cheaper.</text>

<rating>3<//rating><review>Well, I'm conflicted. The food was good, not great but good to very good. My problems came with the execution. The people who work there are very nice, so it's not that they have bad service, maybe I just had a fluke? But didn't get guac that I paid for, which I usually won't write a review over, but if you take 12-15 minutes to make 2 burritos I expect them to be correct. Also I get it, there were a few people in front of me (3), but again. I waited patiently, so I was confused to be handed more food than I paid for, handed another bag of food, have the second bag taken back, and given a third bag with the order wrong. But hey $5 burritos so how much can I really complain?</review>< Pics>

It’s ok. It was mediocre. The fish tacos came with some kind of dressing that isn’t the usual fish taco sauce. It almost tastes like salad dressing. Enchiladas were ok.<//review>

I used to come here a lot, but it seems like they give you less food they used too? Maybe it's just me but the tacos seem to have been miniaturized , I ordered a regular taco and got this tiny little street taco instead.

It's good food but the a gotta be patient , it's not pre made , they actually take time to prepare your food from scratch.  Overall I like Raul's .<//Text>

They claim to take orders over the phone (which would make me spend alot with them.) but these guys have no working phone. They never answer calls.

They're refried beans are not refried.  They are just beans poured out of a can and heated up.  Terrible food compaired to other Taco places.< /review>

My all time favorite Mexican Food spot that I have ever eaten at is my 16 yrs of living in San Diego! I've been eating there that long too! Its a small spot but always hopping! They only take cash but there's a 7- eleven across the street if u forget. The rolled flatus and the chicken soup are 2 of my favorite foods on the planet. I'm not kidding the soup will cure any hang over, sad heart or just hungry belly! My kids love it and they are super picky! I always get it to go head down to Moon Light beach park and sit on the bench and aahhhhh in the magical place I am so blessed to call home! BTW there secret ingredient is LoVE! Everything I've tried here is awesome!<//review>

Raul's has long been my favorite Encinitas taco shop. Their burritos are incredible, they offer vegetarian-friendly off-menu items like potato taquitos, and their salsa is beyond compare. I would bring home 5-gallon drums of it if I could.< /text>

<Review>Best taco place on the strimp.

As a local.

They do very great tacos. But the best they have are the world adobada. Hard to find a good adobada, well, really. So without the doubt of a shadow anywhere, definitely order that...but as a local tip.

So order the adobada taco...but have them put the adobada on the outside. Way better that way. Tell them Kevin sent you, and they wont even flinch. You wont feel disappointment 😎🤙<//Review>< gmapID>

It is a very nice place, with very low prices, even with little 25 cent candies. I've only ever seen one guy work there, but he is very nice. He even got my step-dad a specific
flavor/type of tobacco packets.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>It used to be a terrible place but a young man bought the place in 2016 and spent a lot to remodel the store.  It is now very nice.  I worked in this store in 1971 and he removed flooring and fixtures that were old in 1971.  It is now very nice.   He did a great job.</review>< Pics>

I shall say so far so good. Price is bit higher than average hot pot and it's not a buffet.Two adult spent over 60 dollars easily with normal quantity. Taste is good. Couple of my friend all agree this restaurant is better than the one close to 99 Ranch on Nogalas. One thing have to know is it's very spicy even you order very mild one.<//review>

The restaurant is clean, comfortable, ingredients are fresh， soup broth is amazing, and they have free dessert.
Personally I think this place is little too expensive.< /text>

Everything here is great. Meats are fresh, soup base is spicy, servers are fast and attentive. It is not all you can,eat, but they do have desserts that you can eat as much as tou want after you finish your meal.</Review>

This is a pretty expensive place to eat and you still can't be full. One plate of high quality beef which cost $11.95 only contains 10 to 13 really really thin slices. For the premium lamb, only 10 thin slices and $9 dollars gone. Everything else most likely $3~$5 but only enough for 2 people. We order half and half pot, and the spicy one is very greasy and no taste just spicy. We ordered 2 plates of meat and others are vegetables and tofu, our bill total is $82 after tax...Omg! I would rather go to Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, a lot of cheaper and good quality. I will never come this place again. Also, they charge sauce $1.50 for each person!!<//review>

This is the second time I ate there. The taste is not good  this time. Iwas there when they were grand opening. At that time, the flavor is amazing good. But now is not good as then. Anyone who never tried Sichuan hot pot, you can give a shot. But who is familiar with Chinese hot pot will be disappointed.<//Text>

<Review>Authentic beef tallow hot pot. Soup taste was good but not as amazing as expected( coz it was highly recommended by CHIHUO). Meat slices are thin enough but beef tribes taste a little bit weird. Overall it is delicious but minus one star for really remote location and poor service( they turned off our oven before we finished eating....)< /Review><Date>1482714609202< /Date><gmapID>0x80c32a8a9a5c3c0b:0xb73bb67e6621ac5d<//gmapID>< username>

Only average food. I wasn't too impressed, wasn't too disappointed. Prices are a bit high, but the ingredients seem quality. A good go-to for coffee, just be very clear about what you want though.<//review>

I got my usual chicken chipotle avocado melt and when I got it I realized that it had no red peppers in it and also it was dry like they didn’t put any chipotle sauce.  Very disappointed, night shift is not the move if you want Panera 😑< /Review>

Ordered a pizza and specified very light on the cheese several times but the pizza I got had lots of cheese, hardly any pizza sauce. I also ordered a salad and specified no tomato's and the salad I got had tomato's. 2.5 stars.< /review>

This restaurant is the best Panera in the state! I always come in whenever Lydia is working. She is so nice and she knows the menu inside and out. And if you aren't sure what to get, ask her and she will always lead you to the correct choice. Which is usually cinnamon roll for me.<//Review>

I got a cup of chili that comes with a piece of bread, I bought a 16 oz fountain drink, and a frosted cookie.
$12.89... come on people what's going on here?? I had to wait 10 minutes for something they had in a crock pot?, and there was no one in front of me?😪   I won't be back!
P.S.    A a bunch of 20 year old college students who think you're the to serve them.<//Text>

I love eating here the food is great always satisfied in the end. Theres quite a bit to choose from and even vegans can eat here. The food is a little pricey but its worth it in the end. I'll always come back here for a bite to eat</Text>

<Time>1607868106014< /Time><review>Unfortunately the food quality has gone down.  My husband's grilled cheese wasn't grilled, the bread was spongy like it had been microwaved. Another time they left out a sandwiche completely,  and another they left out the croutons for the soup. I also do not care for their new menu.  Too bad, I used to always be pleased with their food.<//review>< rating>

<review>I have always loved Panera’s. Today I tried their new Mac n cheese and broccoli soup. It’s not soup it’s just thick cheese like gel and tastes terrible. So disappointed. Just take it off your menu and gives us back danishes</review>< Rating>

<Review>Me and my girlfriend just came to this fast food chain and I ordered a small bacon Mac n cheese and a large regular Mac n cheese. Was still charged for the bacon but did not receive any. Was not told if they didn’t have any. No one said anything. Very disappointed< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Don’t get me wrong... I think Panera has good food, but today missed the mark. My soup wasn’t hot and my half avocado sandwich ( grilled) wasn’t even melted inside. Super disappointed!! Especially when we spent 30 bucks for lunch 👎</Review>

Do not ever trust Panera’s catering online ordering system. I placed an order for a meeting about a month in advance. I even called a few days before the meeting to verify that they had my order and they did. 5 minutes after Panera was to arrive and set up at the site with the food and 10 minutes before the people were supposed to have their lunch, Panera calls and tells me they had lost the order and just found it, did I still want it. Not when you are on a time crunch. Then they go onto apologize and offer up some kind of gift certificate for an apology that they NEVER followed through on. Will never use them again.< /Review>

< Review>
Went to Panera because it was easier to get to then what I really wanted to have for dinner.  I ordered a sandwich and the girl who took my order, seemed like she was the manager, was distracted the whole time trying to talk to her employee.  Ending up ordering me the wrong sandwich and I didn't think to check my receipt until I got in the car and down the road and noticed I had the wrong sandwich.  Luckily I wasn't allergic to avocado or I would've been even more upset!<//Review>

I've lived in Chico for 2 years and have been disappointed by this location the entire time. I continue to go, because it's the only Panera in town and I love their food but the service is just terrible. I've waited to post this review hoping that they would get some better team members or even better management but they've messed up my $7 half of a sandwich for the last time. Everyone makes mistakes but the attitude and lack of urgency to correct their mistakes are ridiculous. I spent over $100 on a catered breakfast and the manager didn't even offer to open the door! AND I LEFT 15% TIP ON A PICK UP ORDER. This location does not reflect the normal Panera experience at all, but unfortunately it's the only one in Chico. Good food, just don't go to the one in Chico.< /review>

<Text>The broccoli cheese soup was delicious as was the French bread.  The Napa chicken salad sandwich was very, very poor.  I don't believe you could put a thinner layer of salad on a sandwich and still say it has salad.  The primary filling was a very thick layer of lettuce.  There were also some thin slices of tomato.  The chicken salad was extremely tasteless and the minimal flavor of the salad was over powered by the lettuce.  This was a very expensive lettuce sandwich.  The food is expensive but we are willing to pay the price because it is usually very good.  This experience has turned us away from Panera for a while.  I gave a two star rating only because the soup was very good. A zero star rating would be appropriate for the chicken salad sandwich if that were the only thing we had eaten.<//Text><GmapID>0x80832880fe0dfa6b:0x72334e8ada7d17e7<//GmapID><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1551829883438< /Date><userid>104634928052670421735< /userid>< Rate>

Had half sandwich and salad, absolutely excellent! But what wasn't so excellent was the loaf of tomato basil bread we bought in addition. We had it sliced, and obviously there was a loaf of raisin bread sliced before ours, and the slicer was NOT wiped clean after the raisin bread, because each one of the slices of tomato bread tastes like raisins! Can you say CROSS CONTAMINATION?? Needless to say we were VERY disappointed!< /Review>

Love Panera but recently my latest visit I found out they are no Gluten free bread options. No worries, right? No, because my 9 year old doesn't just want a salad, she likes her ham and cheese. As if that wasn't challenging enough the employee proceeds to tell me that I could go to Great Harvest and check there as they might have GF options. I enjoy Panera and it's MANY options but why have you not add NEW Gluten Free bread item to the menu? Your the only 🍞 place that I know can not provide a GF bread.😔< /review>

Food is great. But just used the drive thru and didn't get my chips and only got half a sandwich instead of the whole. Too pricey to make mistakes like that. $15 for half the sandwich and a cup of soup. Awesome.< /Review>

You get what it looks like here. I was hesitant to try it....& In some ways still am.... This is 100% better than normal fast food and I still prefer less chain-oriented meals.
The staff was very nice and prompt.
The soup was great (not the biggest serving on a large).
The sandwich was not toasted so make sure to check when ordering...And a good deal on a large... The salad was tasty and a bit pricy but a lot of food and I'm so happy they have the choice. Leagues above a fast-food salad.
The chai latte was extremely sweet for my taste.< /review>

Panera Bread has amazing breads and pastries. Next time you have their sandwich made with focaccia bread which is so delicious you can say thank-you to the baker "John".  They also make their crouton's out of the same bread.

One of my favorites is something called YOU PICK TWO!  This allows you to have a half sandwich with salad or soup.  Eating healthy like that allows me to get a yummy pastry as a reward.  It may be massive justification but it works for me.

Check it out<//text>

Strawberry poppy salad  had hard bits of gross lettuce and only a couple pieces of chicken. The broccoli cheddar soup was alright, but an hour after eating it I was sick to my stomach. Americans are killing themselves with fast cheap "food". This is the first time I've ever been compelled to post a review.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>Really nice atmosphere, great food options. Cashiers can be very slow and it creates a line sometimes, hopefully with the kiosks they installed that will take a load off the cashiers. Last I went my food was cold, but they fixed that fairly quickly for me.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

As a vegan you Defintly have a limitation on where you go to eat out, as a salad place you would expect them to have options but no They do not. I learned the hard way so you wouldn't have to. If your a vegitarian the only thing you can eat is the black bean soup.< /text>

Very dissatisfied with the tuna sandwich that I had. There was very little meat in the sandwich on sourdough bread. My husband had a tuna sandwich, as well., on their honey wheat bread.  There was only enough tuna to make a complete HALF sandwich‼️. Way to pricey. Don't think we will go back< /Review>

Food is ok, nothing spectacular.  What you get is a very expensive deli sandwich.  The workers are very nice and helpful.  Place was clean.  For the price, try a sit down restaurant, like Sin of Cortez.< /text>

Have been coming to Marie Callender's for their pies for years now, and most recently tried out their menu for the first time, despite the sketchy reviews we've seen online. Much to our pleasure, everything was absolutely wonderful! We had the avocado shrimp stack as an appetizer, and it was delicious, the pico de gallo was full of flavor and the perfect amount of spicy! I had an amazing BBQ hamburger, my only complaint was I needed a hundred napkins because it was HUGE!! My wife had the soup and salad bar and we took the opportunity to try their red velvet pie special thanks to my free slice of pie that came with my hamburger (amazing). We also took home a couple of whole pies, which are only 7.99 for the whole month of Feb which were also absolutely wonderful. Better price than Costco, bigger and you seriously can't beat homemade pies, and homemade whip cream!!! Might be our favorite new place to eat, can't believe we've been coming here this whole time just for pies!<//review>

This was my first time at a Panera and I was pleasantly surprised how good the food is. Normally I'm not a fan of chain gourmet but I tagged along for a business lunch and left very satisfied. I'm a vegetarian and amateur vegetarian and vegan cook and my experience finding decent options elsewhere, during my time in Chico, was rough. I had the black bean soup and the Mediterranean veggie sandwhich, both were so flavorful and not bland or heavy in a single flavor, i.e. most "Mediterranean" items at other places are heavy on raw red onion and or vinegar with bland tzatziki. Staff was amazing by the way, we were a very large group and they streamlined us perfectly. Also very attentative to patrons all around. This location was emasculately clean as well. The only reason I didn't give a full 5 star was because I want to see what other options they can come up with for vegetarians. Corn chowder? Veggie gumbo? Hint hint ;-)<//Text>

<Review>I've given this place a few tries and was disappointed. I don't like giving bad reviews but this place is weird. I went here and got a bbq chicken salad and half a roasted turkey blt. Both made me sick. Also when I ordered they where very rude and when I got my food there was a random roll of bread in the top of my bag. I also got a lemonade and that was ok. But overall this place just doesn't try to make it a good environment. I do not recommend this place.<//Review>< Pics>

Really tasty food, but doesn't get five stars because it seems slightly over priced and the portions are on the small side (except for the salads)< /review>

Had a bacon turkey sandwich.  When I picked it up and back at the table I noticed that there was no bacon.  Took it back to the kitchen and told them there was no bacon.  I was then asked if I wanted them to fix a other.  Well I said that is what I paid for.  Not the first time our order wasn't what we asked for.   Also they were out of avocado.   REALLY!

Seams like they rarely have more than one cashier.< /Text>

This is our 3rd time here and our third time with multiple items not in stock.  No bread bowls no flat bread no baguettes. Getting tired of them not stocking properly. Our cashier told the manager we were upset about no bread bowls.  She didn't even apologize, just ignored the employee, right in front of us.  Employees voiced being treated poorly and that management doesn't listen.  Panera, this is a wake up call. Fix your stuff.</review>

Raul was so pleasant to work with. I was running late and missed my appointment, but he was able to reschedule me for later in the day. I also forgot my DMV paperwork, but he was super patient with me while I scrounged around in my glove compartment to find my old registration. I was able to use a coupon from the website for $20 off, and I was in and out in 15 minutes. Very satisfied, I'll definitely come back for future smog tests.</Text>

<review>If you need a smog test this is the place to go. I had a 2 appointment and he was right on time!! He gave me a discount that really helped.  Place is a little hard to find but not impossible and his waiting room should be avoided as it is very dirty. As far as his work is it was spot on!!</review>< resp>

Hard to really rate a smog check service. Every time I take my car in, they give it a passing report. Is that good? Or is that bad? I'll assume that the car is actually not polluting more than current standards allow and call it "good".
They successfully upload the pass result to the DMV systems so that I can complete the registration the next day, so that's good.
The "waiting area" is kinda iffy. Thankfully they've never made me wait there for too long.
The guy handling intakes was polite and efficient.
All in all, a good enough smog check service, I think.< /review>

Normally this place let's you drop in and get a smog but due to COVID you have to make an appointment.  I didnt know this and the guy was kinda rude about saying, but he had been repeating himself all day I'm sure. But in our defense none of knew and they didnt let their customers know. So be patient!<//review>

First off, with the coupon I had handy, I got my smog & certificate for $38 even ('04 civic) so that was pretty sweet.

Second, I rolled up at 11:40, no appointment, and was finished before noon.  Absurdly fast (admittedly there wasn't anybody else being serviced at the time, but even so, it was quick)

Third, the tech who took care of my car was quite friendly & polite.  Greeted with a smile, made sure I had all my paperwork in order, & was just all around pleasant.

Even without the coupon the price would have been better than a number of the other shops around, so that was really just an added bonus.

I'll be coming back when I need my next smog check, and have already pointed a few friends this way as well.</Text>

I just found out about these guys and wished I had known about them sooner! This smog shop has a sibling office down the road that also offers DMV services (for a fee). It is a family run shop that employs competent and courteous technicians and managers. All you have to do is show up with your paperwork and if you need to register or file any other paperwork just go down the street to the registration office and they take good care of you! HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE!</Text>

I hate getting my car smogged. For me it's like going to the dentist. These guys do an excellent job and the process was inexpensive.</review>

<Review>I'm very wary to recommend this shop to anyone. They said my car failed the visual inspection after passing the state tests with no issues. I saw no issues before, during, or after the test. The tech further stated that he "doesn't do anything without getting paid" when I asked for a retest. Just a heads up when selecting this place among all the other local shops.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I have been to the Santa Rosa and Petaluma shops and have never had a bad experience! I had an older car and was told over the phone it would be a little more expensive because another test is required- with my Val-pak coupon it was still under $50!

I have had 5 cars tested at 101 smog and bringing #6 tomorrow :)</text>

Repeat customer from 2 years ago, had a great experience in 2011 and today. Had originally been referred by a friend. Two young guys working had to make a business successful; price was right and they accommodated my schedule. Was concerned that my truck might not pass since my OBDII scanner couldn't connect to the OBDII port, was told they'd check before they ran the test. If they couldn't connect they wouldn't run the test.

The only knock is they only have 3 chairs in the waiting room (2 additional chairs are broken) but you're also not paying auto dealer prices. Keep up the good work guys and
thanks for your help today.< /Text>

< Review>
Absolutely terrible.  The vehicle passed emissions, but they said the catalytic converter did not have the proper EO # on it.  This vehicle has passed at other Star stations.  They also would not accept a company check.  Quite sure I was ripped off.  Never going there again<//Review>

{'time': 1462304660361, 'text': "Just for the record. In the great state of California, all vehicles that are subject to undergo a smog test and that have non-standard parts fitted (that are part of the emission system) require an Executive Order (EO) number to be visible on the part at the time of test. Sadly, your vehicle had no such part number. This was clearly explained to you at the time.\nWe do not make the rules, we are obliged to carry them out however unpopular or inconvenient you may find this. If we are subject to a bar inspection and are remiss in our duties, we get a big citation and fine.\n\nIf you believe we are in error, you should contact the BAR Referee and put your case before them.\n\nVisit www.asktheref.org or call (800) 622-7733 to learn more details about the BAR Referee Program, find a Referee station, or to schedule an appointment.\n\nRegarding our company policy of NO CHECKS, every clipboard where you sign the work orders front and back have a notice in red. The distance from the signature box to this NO CHECKS is approximately one inch. There is also a NO CHECKS sign again in red stuck to the window some six inches from where you attempted to pay by check.\n\nThrowing your card at my technician will not carry favor, neither will the verbal tirade directed at him. In actual fact the father of your company's president was kind enough to apologize for your unreasonable behavior.\n\nThe final question that springs to mind, was that if your vehicle passed at other smog stations, why dig you come to ours?"}< /resp>

I went there this morning. I did not make an appointment as the website said; walk ins welcome. I  was treated like I was stupid, and made to wait outside (until a guy let me inside who was not affiliated with 101). It was fast, but the two shop guys attitudes were terse and condescending< /Review>

You are correct, walk-ins are very welcome however an appointment will usually be more expeditious when we are busy.\n\nI apologize most sincerely and unreservedly that you were asked to wait outside. The mitigating circumstances are that on Mondays & Thursdays our machines are required to be calibrated, however I realize that this did not apply to the machine used for your vehicle.\n\nI have spoken to my staff on the subject on the brusque manner with which you were allegedly treated and this issue has been addressed. Once again on behalf of us all please accept our apologies.\n\nAll the very best, Adrian...'}</Response><gmap_id>0x8084380f9eaffd45:0x1825bb400b032ac7</gmap_id><Date>1471882461302<//Date>< pics>

<pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1497490526929, 'text': 'Just for clarification purposes, you made an appointment for your 19 year old son at 1:00pm to bring the 1999 Honda Accord in, and were quoted a discounted price by our technician at the time the appointment was made.\n\nYour son arrived at approximately 10:45am, he did not mention the booking or the discounted price and was happy to pay the published wall price. This fact was confirmed to our technician on the telephone when you phoned up to fire a tirade of abuse at him. When you asked your son, if he indeed had notified us of either the booking, or the discount, he quite clearly said and I quote "NO!" At this point, you then chose to entertain our technician with your obscene language directed at your son, and then redirected it at our technician.\n\nAfter you finished abusing my staff through what must either be your own incompetence, I am stunned that you have the temerity to go on a public forum and vent.\n\nIt is painfully obvious by the your son\'s admission that he didn\'t notify us that, and that we are neither mind readers or psychics. Had you had approached the situation in a more contrite manner, I would have probably refunded the difference. Seeing as you could not contain your passion, I am inclined to not refund the difference and maybe in the future, you might communicate to your grown man of a son that he should come at the appointed time, identify himself that an appointment was made and that you had a discounted price quoted.

Called around and found that they were the cheapest place with an appointment price of $40.  I made an appointment for noon, showed up on time and only spent about 20 minutes there total from pull in to pull out. Staff seemed friendly but it's a couple of younger guys running a smog check station not a fine dining restaurant so I don't know what other people who left bad reviews about that were expecting.< /Text>

{'time': 1530812072363, 'text': 'I’m very sorry for the inconvenience. The reason you could not have been dealt with promptly is, we only had one technician working until 10am and he was smog testing one car & busy calibrating one of our testing machines. This test is required twice a week by BAR. Usually we have two technicians and a service writer in attendance.\nWe have no way of screening calls. Once again I apologize for being unable to deal with your call in a timely manner.'}</Response>

<review>I love this place. I've been going to this restaurant since it was located off Lakewood Blvd and Stewart & Gray. The food is amazing and the seasoning is unique. I love their Super Deluxe Burrito De Carne Azada in Green Sauce. It's huge and the prices are very reasonable. Their fajita plates are also amazing.

It is a family owned restaurant so the ambiance is very personable. Love this place and I haven't had anything that even comes close to it.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEp9xTtLoR4QSm2n7azizbkx3MLub99GsRHNxC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGm0PSKNzj7OjvGB1vyjyknCtvqHRnvJHCKONO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
First off, it’s hot as heck. No air conditioning whatsoever. The many fans they have just circulate warm stuffy air throughout the place. Secondly, the tables are beyond sticky. Sticky, sticky material the napkins stay stuck. You have to rip them up to pick them up. I ordered the green enchiladas. I thought, “simple enough. You can’t really mess that up too much.” Bland. Not only did it lack flavor, but also sauce. They were pretty dry.. the rice that was included tasted & had the consistency of reheated old rice. Needless to say, i won’t be going back.< /Review>

Absolutely delicious. I had the shredded beef burrito plate with red sauce. The beef was so flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. Sauce is always iffy for me, but this sauce delivered. Highly recommend.< /text>

Their red sauce that they use for many plates is delicious. Their assortment of salsas are tasty & vary in the level of spiciness. They can get crowded at times, but in my opinion is totally worth it. I've been coming here for many years & have never been disappointed. Highly recommend!<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2cda5d50647f1:0xb68eddb991ee0478</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The food is great.  For the most part,  the staff is great as well with the exception of one of the waiters.  He's the older gentlemen with glasses.  It seems like he's in a bad mood all the time,  no customer service manners.  Everyone else is great.<//text>

The food is wonderful. My favorite is the Chili Verde! U can get large or small portions. Great family atmosphere and gathering place. A family own business and a Downey favorite.<//review>

Went their for dinner a few months back. The place was not so busy so i expected to be seated fairly quickly. Not the case. They just kept walking by us as if we were not even there. And when they did see us, it looked like they did not even care. 2 servers at the bar talking smack about some of the customers and who knows what else. We decided to leave and swore never to return to a place that is so disrespectful to their customers. I will not recommend this place to anyone I know.

Very dissappointed<//Text>

The food is am amazing. The service is just horrible. Been coming here for years. The la Mirada location is way better.  I'm here right now. All of a sudden they can't take cards?  Last time i was here got here at 30 min before they closed and told me it's take out only. Nvr had that happen. Been coming to The Downey location for more 20 yrs maybe 25 years. Last few times coming here has been bad. Don't even eat. Like I said. Food is amazing. Service and the server is absolutely rude.</review>

I was not disappointed with the food or the service at all. In my opinion, you can tell alot about a Mexican restaurant by how good the beens are and the beans, Mexican style rice and sauces were delicious. I ordered the carne asada tampiqueña, hubby ordered the wet burrito in red sauce, my son ordered the green chile enchiladas and my daughter ordered the kids chicken tacos. I had a taste of everything and all of it was tasty and well made. The portions are HUGE too. all around, it was a good dining experience.<//text>< userid>

<Date>1495929151513< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>Was very disappointed in the food.  My friend and I both ordered cheese enchilada, taco and ref ride beans.  The taco was sitting in the sauce from the enchilada and was so soggy on the one side you had to eat the inside with a fork, no way to pick it up.  We thought the prices were a little high for the quality of the food plus you order it at a counter no waitress or waiter.  We agreed we will not go back.</Text>< pictures>

Huge portions, however since this isn't an "assembly line" fast food Mexican restaurant,  do expect to wait for your food a little bit, while they prepare it.< /Text>

One of my favorite Asian markets.  You can buy fresh fish and get them cleaned up and fried while you shop.  (They change the frying oil twice a week, I been told.). Seasonal tropical fruits: longan, lychees, jackfruit, etc... together with Asia vegitables and herbs and spices are well stocked with competitive prices.<//review>

<user>110205864576748353985</user><Review>I spent a month at Drug Rehab Orange County getting clean. Their treatment program was tough at first but that's because all I was thinking about was using. After detox, it got a lot easier. I was involved in a bunch of activities that really got my mind off of using and eventually I stopped thinking about drugs completely. Rehab was tough but it was worth it.< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I first found out about THH Bakery Cafe from my home care nurse/friend Cecelia.  Even though she is Pinoy (from the Philippines), She LOVES  Vietnamese food. One day she brought me a Banh Mi sandwich from THH. Until then, I had only ever eaten a Banh Mi from Lee's Sandwiches (fast food chain - not Bad, just OK). Much to my Delight/Surprise, It was AMAZING!! Ever since then, I make it a point to stop at THH every time I have to go and visit the nurses (and sometimes I make the trip even between visits, it's THAT GOOD). Since then, I have developed a fondness for many other menu items. You truly can't beat their Cheap Prices or High-Quality. On top of all that, THH Bakery makes the best French baguette this side of Paris! In my humble opinion, I think everybody should try a sandwich from THH at least once in their life, THEY ARE THAT GOOD!!
BTW, I'm so sorry about the 4-Star rating, but it's for 1 Reason Only. Yes, I realize that a Vietnamese Restaurant IS going to have Vietnamese Employees, BUT... Sometimes the person at the counter doesn't even try to understand me. I'm Caucasian, and don't speak Vietnamese. Most days, they get someone from the back who speaks/understands English well enough to help me, but NOT ALWAYS. On 2 separate occasions, they didn't have anybody in the restaurant who understood English well enough to take my order. I ended up leaving both times without being able to purchase any food. That made me sad 💔. If you come during prime lunch hours (11am-2pm ish?), they ALWAYS have an English speaker on hand. I even had a High School student who was waiting for HIS lunch order offer to translate for me last week.

My Favorites:
Banh Mi- #1 House Special cold cut meats, pate, shredded pickled carrots, daikon radish, fresh cilantro, cucumbers & thin sliced jalapeño pepper.$3.25

Banh Mi- #2 BBQ'd Grilled Pork with shredded pickled carrots, daikon radish, fresh cilantro, cucumbers & thin sliced jalapeño pepper. $3.25

Banh Mi- #11 Pork Meatball with shredded pickled carrots, daikon radish, fresh cilantro, cucumbers & thin sliced jalapeño pepper. $3.25

Banh Bao - Steamed Bun filled with Shredded BBQ Pork, Hard boiled eggs, fresh herbs and spices. - $1.50

Pork Egg Rolls - Crispy Fried. - .65¢ each</Text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) We had lunch at Saigon View, the food was above average, the seats were airy but the dishes such as vermicelli, pho, banh xeo, and beef stock were a little too expensive compared to the price.

(Original)
Chúng tôi ăn trưa ở Saigon View, thức ăn trên trung bình, chỗ ngồi thoáng mát nhưng món ăn như bún riêu, phở, bánh xèo, bò kho một phần ít quá nên so với giá cả vậy là đắt.<//text>

<response>None< /response><text>Came into this shop today because I happened to be in the area and wanted to redeem a free scoop of ice cream from a coupon I got via email.

I got the Made with Snickers Bars kids scoop (2.5 oz), and it was sweet and a perfect bite to end a big Ethiopian meal for lunch.  Big chunks of chopped up Snickers pieces in buttery caramel ice cream swirled with a caramel ribbon.

The parking lot is small but we found a spot.  The two ladies behind the counter were nice and worked fast to get us through the line and out the door quickly.</text><Rate>4</Rate>< name>

I used to come here as a kid (30+ years ago!) glad to see they’re still in business, especially during this COVID situation (Aug. 1020)

Nothing beats peanut butter and chocolate ice cream to help reduce stress during a pandemic.</Text><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

A small location, but with outside seating should the inside be full! Tasty ice cream, great cones, and all the flavours you're looking for! The parking lot here can get a little tight, as it serves multiple business locations. The staff are friendly, fast and patient with anyone who wants to try flavours! A great place to visit on a warm night!< /Text>

Went in close to closing which is annoying I get it but to be mean mugged and not even spoken to when walking in the store and then even minutes after that is unacceptable.

< Review>
You known I believe that Betty Chin not only  saved my life but her team also helped me to turn my life around. Betty told me i had to go to the ER or move out because i couldnt walk and i kept falling down my primary dr. Told me I was as healthy as a 25 year old kid the next day I was in emergency surgery  woke up with 260 staples and told i was told they saved my leg. Today 5 months later I've gained 31lbs on ssi and walking awesome. And I know I would have died Aug. 3 2017 as a clot was in my left leg that would have killed me  THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTY CHIN AND HER FABULOUS CREW. FOR GIVING THIS MAN A REAL LIFE</Review>

<Review>I'd like to thank Betty and everyone I've come into contact with while at the Village. First, I've been homeless since 2004. And in all that time I've never come across anyone so selfless. Words can't express just what that means to people that truly need a helping hand. And most of all. No Agenda! Thanks from the bottom of my heart.< /Review>< Pics>

I cannot appreciate or like an organization that is hypocritical, even in the homeless aspect. Betty Chinn was nice to start with and then became indignant and high-brow in the short time I dealt with her.</review>

<rating>1< /rating><review>After being homeless for a year I managed to find an apartment for rent. I have been living in my one bedroom apartment alone for three months now. I cannot seem to afford thr basics let alone a bed. I work full time but my income only covers my rent. I called Betty Chinn to ask if there was any assistance I qualify for to help me with my electric and gas bill and if there was any assistance that will help me get a bed or any household items. Betty chinn told me that she could not help me and shes sorry for my situation. As a tax payer I am very concerned as to why the Betty Chinn center exists and why is the city funding this community outreach center?

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We had a great buying experience at Bob's,  a family member recommended Bob's to us. We shopped around at 8+ local furniture stores before making our purchase at Bob's.  Our sales person Steve was great and answered all of our questions.  Steve went above and beyond to make sure we were informed and happy with our sectional couch purchase!

I have never had such an horrible experience with a furniture company. I ordered a house full of new furniture from multiple places and Bob's was by far the worse. I ordered online in November which I was warned there were shipping delays and that's fine. I went into the store to change my address and confirm my day to pick up at the store. We'll the sales guy convinced me to upgrade to delivery because if I didn't I could get my stuff in peices at different times. Thought that was weird but ok. Doing this delayed the date I would receive my product by 18 days. My husband and I went in the next week to look around and confirm address change again. They said all is good. Now it was the day before delivery and I got a text saying they were delivering  to my old address so I  drove an hour into town to talk to the store in person to make sure they had CORRECT address... they did not so the lady changed it again and wrote a note to the driver and delivery team she ensured I would have my table the next day. Wouldn't you know it  I got a call from the driver asking where I was because they were at my old address!!! They then has to reschedule my delivery a week later. It was delivered today and what I got was a cracked table that someone tried to cover up!!!!! This is ridiculous!! Now I have to wait until almost JUNE for a new table!! Worst service ever!! I will never recommend this company to anyone.<//review>

<Review>Availability abd type of furniture was very important to us. Jordan was very kind and knowledgeable in all aspects of the purchase and explained everything thoroughly. We had a great experience. It was nice to walk in and not have that car sales feeling. Thank you.<//Review>< pictures>

We had Jordan help us & we loved his sale approach. We didn't feel rushed, being pushed to products, he just straight away explained how we can look at the prices and told us if we needed any help to let him know. We found the patio set we wanted (after visiting 5 other furniture stores) and I hailed him down. No gimmicks, just stated our options and we were able to finish transaction standing there and with a receipt we were on our way and expecting  the delivery the same week. So excited! We will definitely be coming back because we need to replace our family room lounge set and we honestly loved how open the show room was. It was loaded with people, we could see pieces clearly. Bobs wasn't even on our agenda - we had been across the way visiting Ashley's when we saw Bobs and though to stop there since it was close. Glad we did! Love this furniture store</text>

<Review>Abby was great!! Everyone we encountered was friendly. When walking in, we were quickly greeted and then pointed in the direction of what we were looking for. At first I couldn’t recall Abbys name, but she found us and was able to assist us. She was very knowledgeable about her products and if she didn’t know; she quickly found out. She wasn’t pushy with her sales either! That’s one major thing I loved.</Review>< Pictures>

The customer service was amazing! They were very courteous and helpful. Bob’s furniture literally had everything my fiancé and I were looking for all on their show room floor! We looked at well over 10 other furniture stores and did not have any luck with them. Bobs had the best selection and the best price of all of them, I highly recommend putting them on your list of places when you’re looking for furniture!</Review>

They have very good quality of furniture at a price anyone can afford. Very nice customer service and the air conditioner was a very welcomed experience on a hot day. I will be shopping there again. Thanks Abby!< /text>

<Review>Bought a bedroom set for my daughter here. Super friendly staff very knowledgeable and professional. Never felt obligated to buy or pressured in to buying anything. The warranty on the furniture is what sold me. Thanks you Kendyll for all your help. I recommend Bob's furniture to everyone. Thanks again The Garcia family<//Review>< Pics>

<text>My Friend and I were looking for couches and The staff was very helpful. They have music playing and a lot of staff running around. The place wasn’t too busy and they had good prices. The sales people don’t hound you and stand over you like some other places. We liked that they respected our space and took our temperature at the door. Really enjoyed the place.<//text>< Response>

I was greeted and a floor rep was immediately assigned to me. But they did not follow me which I love. Once I found what I liked, I ordered it, scheduled delivery, and paid on their iPad. Payment process took 3-5 minutes, I was in and out in 15 min. Thank you river park bobs!< /Text>

<text>Erica was very friendly and helpful. She pointed me in the direction of what I was looking for, explained where I could find pricing info, and let me browse uninterrupted. She was nearby if I had any questions, but not in a creepy way. I liked the selection and how many pieces come in various colors etc. The furniture seems affordable for real furniture that you don’t have to put together yourself.</text><userid>113109442695919871534<//userid></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT!!! Purchase anything from Bob's Discount Furniture you will be promised a delivery date and never get your items as promised. We ordered and paid for items on 3/7/21 and were suppose to receive on 3/25/21 we were told our items didn't come on the truck and they'd be here on 4/8/21. I called on 4/8/21 and was advised once again they didn't come in and would be here for sure on 4/15/21. On 4/15/21 my husband called and  was advised items were in and it was okay to pick up we had our son in law meet us there. When my husband got there to pick up the items they told him our items were NOT IN and there would be a  delay because of a fire. The entire staff at the Fresno store have no idea what the heck there doing. Find somewhere else to buy you furniture. If I could they'd get Zero Stars but that option isn't available.</text>

I called with a few questions about delivery. My rep, John, was friendly, patient, and extremely helpful. I have a close move date, and he took the time out to check what was in stock what wasn’t. He also waited while I looked for an alternate piece of furniture because the one I selected wouldn’t be available for a month. The whole process was simple and quick, and John was a delight to deal with!< /Text>

As soon as I walked I was immediately greeted and personally assisted. The salesman, Greg, was not pushy not trying to rush you out the door. He was very attentive and and listened to your wants. Needless to say I am now a Bob's Furniture fan.</Review>

Cross was very attentive and knowledgeable about not only the products themselves but also the purchasing process. He was very clear in all communication in person and via text. There was no hassle, no desperate need for a sale and he was able to meet me where I was and make sure I was happy with my purchase. Cross went above and beyond and because of my fantastic experience I would recommend this store to everyone.</review>

Janet was great to deal with. We went in to look at a sectional couch and in no time we were on our way with the couch on order. Janet got us interest free financing too. This was at the Bob’s on Blackstone in Fresno.</Review>

This afternoon Frank helped us with viewing and provided us with helpful info on a dining room set.  However Daniel the manager gladly honored the price and we made the sale! Thanks Frank and Daniel for your customer service!
We will definitely be back if they because they continue to provide great customer and ensure that everyone is safe during the pandemic 😷</Text>

She is amazing, very knowledgeable (as I definitely needed some assistance finding exactly what I was looking for), very professional and welcoming. She was even able to get my delivery scheduled within the week as I was expecting a long wait time with all the covid delays going on in the furniture world right now. Hands down great experience and will be going here for all my furniture and mattress needs in the future!<//Text>< pics>

<review>Leslie (a manager at the Fresno location) ensured my purchase, delivery, and customer service experiences were seamless. When a furniture piece arrived with a manufacturing defect on delivery day, I was able to quickly get the issue resolved due to Leslie’s professionalism and accommodation. I have worked in retail before, and I can confidently say that she represents the essence of customer service, which speaks volumes of Leslie, as well as Bob’s Furniture and their sales/management staff. I am very satisfied with my experience here and will come back again if I have the opportunity!</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It was a great experience going to Bob's. The guy that helped me, Steve, awesome guy. He was super nice and helpful, explained everything to me about the delivery and the goof protection. The couch we got is super comfortable and very cushiony. Next time we go looking for furniture, we're starting here and going straight to Steve. 👍< /text>

They take your temperature before you enter which I thought was wonderful. They were friendly and not pushy. It was very simple. They pointed us in the right direction of what we were looking for and once we found it we found someone to help us and she did great. It was very simple. Love that they have the option to have it delivered and assembled same day!< /Review>

First, if you want customer service you will be dispatched to Guatemala after a long series of “press #” over and over.  I’ve been told for 3 months that the feet to my chair were on the way.  This company is shady...I wonder if the 5 stars are from bought and paid for reviews.  Nothing seems on the up and up...go elsewhere.</review>

I wasn't in a great mood to begin with (my bad) but we needed a new couch and had the time that day. We went to a bunch of places and all the sales people were either rude or dismissive.

Steve was genuinely friendly and kind. He listened to us and explained everything we wanted and needed to know. He's a good guy and I believe he's invested in doing a good job, not just selling furniture. I was in a not good mood and the guys energy was enough for me to relax and enjoy a conversation.

The store was also the only one we visited that temperature checked us and had hand sanitizer. They actually care about your health...crazy!

Good stuff all around, ill update when the furniture arrives.</review>

I had bought my fuinture with bobs in June of 2017 and they told me that if I add 500 dollars for insurance  that if my pillows are worn down I can change them before my 5yrs are up so this march I did just that and now they won't change it because it's not beat up. I will never ever use Bob's furniture again because they sold false advertisement<//text>

<Review>Our delivery experience with 2 out of 3 furniture was a complete disaster. The massage chair was broken. Out pull out couch didn't have the mattress even though they said it would be shipped together. The mattress was back ordered twice, the second time without notice. Customer service was polite but not helpful at all. I wouldn't recommend buying from this place.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1618239374483, 'text': 'Hello Mister.

<text>We’ve shopped at Bob’s Discount Furniture in Fresno several times now. Every time, we were greeted with a smile and assisted immediately. Steve cares about his customers and takes his time to make sure the furniture and/or accessories we were searching for were just what we needed. He’s very knowledgeable about the products he sells. Steve makes a process that can be grueling very pleasant. My husband and I will continue to shop at Bob’s Discount Furniture for the quality of their products and will definitely be asking for Steve again for the quality of his professionalism!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Had a great experience at Bob’s Furniture store today. Steve was our sales associate and was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. This was our first stop in couch shopping today so we left to check out 5 other places and ended up back at Bob’s by the end of the day because none of the other stores compared to their price and they had the style of leather couch we wanted. Thank you again Steve!< /Text>

<review>First off: this is by far the best furnature store. I'd like to thank Steve for having great personality, communication skills, and customer service. Steve is so awesome and genuine. He had patience and tolerated me well. People with dull personalities are lame and boring and thank you for being awesome (and not one of those people) <3
Having good staff makes customers more comfortable and content with buying from a store. The great prices, nice furnature, and awesome staff makes me always come back to buy more furnature from here.

Thank you again Steve you really made my day!

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I ordered a sofa online almost 2 weeks ago. Received a confirmation email, money was taken out from my account and still haven’t heard from Bob’s furniture since. They say a rep will reach out and discuss pick up, but nothing. I called their number which took me through prompts, then when I selected to speak to a rep and chose the Fresno location, it took me back to the very beginning of the call with the same prompts! So I had to select others and spoke to a general customer service rep who had told me last week that my sofa would be ready for pick up this Thursday. It’s Saturday and I still hadn’t received any phone calls or emails. I tried entering my phone number onto the online order tracker and it says my number isn’t associated with an order. So I called the general customer rep dept. again and now they say my order is delayed for another week. I don’t mind the delay, but it’s very frustrating that Bob’s Furniture isn’t communicating this information to me. I’m having to go through several prompts just to get some info and even thought they scammed me when I couldn’t pull up my order online. I gave them a 1 star due to extreme lack of communication. Which is unfortunate because my brother and parents have bought furniture from them in the past (in store) and recommended them.<//Review>< pics>

Anyone and everyone should ask for Steve! I just left Bob’s and had the best furniture experience I’ve ever had. I didn’t know I could enjoy furniture shopping so much until today. I was a little skeptical at first, thought I just wanted to be left alone to glance at all the furniture but Steve was so informative and personable; he was so patient with me and even had me laughing the whole time. He took me all the way around the building telling me about all the great things about each couch and sectional, only for me to buy the first thing I looked at. Lol He was such a good sport and worked hard to find me exactly what I was looking for. I’m so happy with my purchase and if I ever need furniture I know exactly where to go and who to ask for! Steve is awesome! Highly recommend! If I could give him more stars I would!</text>

WoW Bob’s Discount has blown it out of the water. Other furniture stores need to learn from them. I thought I would never be able to own leather furniture as furniture stores charge an OUTRAGES amount. The customer service at Bob’s was magnificent! Soo glad they made the move to the west! They are showing California, everything does not have to be so expensive.<//Text>

<Text>My experience here was not good. Larry was helping my husband and I pick out our couches and adjustable base. I didn't want to finance the items but my husband wanted to built his credit. So we asked Larry about the credit info and if my husband can be added as an authorized user to built his credit score. Larry said it should help our scores, so trusting him we signed up for the finance. Turns out Wells Fargo told us that my husband could only be an authorized user however his credit score will not have any impact. For someone who has worked here for a few years and does not know this is very incompetent and disappointing. It makes us regret even financing the items and getting useless credit at Bob's. Thanks for that Larry... I hope you and others will learn from our experience.

And i'm only giving them a 1 star because they have affordable items. If they were just honest about the finance, we would have paid the items up front and given them a 5 star.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Kendall is absolutely awesome. I bought my furniture from her at the end of February and love it. The furniture pattern had that unique chevron look to it and I absolutely love it.
I just came back today and purchased my kitchen table, living room decor and my lap. She is extremely helpful and her ideas are very creative.
Kendall is my go to girl at BoBs Furniture and I won't deal with anyone else but her.<//review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>We went to Bobs just a week ago looking for a sofa set. A sales rep by the name of Jordan helped us and was absolutely amazing. Very knowledgeable about the products they carried and the availability of delivery. Every other furniture store we went to was 4-6 weeks out for delivery but Jordan got a majority of our stuff sent to us within a couple days! Instead of leaving with just a sofa set we got the living room set, an adjustable bed, a whole bedroom set for our 9 year old and a massage chair. Although Bobs has amazing prices and great quality products the reason we purchased so much was because of the sales rep.   He even stayed after hours to finish up our order. We already sent my mother in law over there and will be purchasing more items this week. Also there Goof Proof policy is great!  I definitely recommend this place! Everything was great, even delivery and set up!! When you go in ask for Jordan!! We are a customer for life!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This store is ridiculous... ordered bedroom furniture from this place and they delivered it broken! On 5 different occasions they tried delivering my purchased in full furniture. And each time it was broken... and one time the delivery guys were talking bad about me in Spanish (I speak Spanish) so I cancelled my ordered and it took them almost 3 weeks for them to reimburse me. Do yourself a favor and go to another furniture store and save yourself time and money</Text>

< Review>
The sales rep was great! Prices great! Ordered our dinning table and chairs in September 28 and paid cash, furniture was to be delivered on November 22, just in time for Thanksgiving, just receive a message from our sales rep that it now has been delayed until LATE December. Oh and don’t bother calling the call center! They send you through to many hoops and NEVER! Answer the phone. Thinking about canceling the order and get my money back🤬<//Review>

Janet was really nice. She helped with most of the finding part. I just needed to go home to measure some stuff out and when i came back the next day someone else helped me continue the process of the purchase. The people at Bobs furniture were always really nice no matter who i worked with. Very nice and awesome people they worked well with my move into my new place. Just waiting for the delivery!!☺☺< /review>

We went in to look to buying a dining table for our home. When we arrived Stephen are Sales Associate helped us and welcomed us with a friendly greeting. He answered our questions and gave us a breakdown of what the table consist of and the breakdown of price. The buying process to choose our dining table set went smoothly and we were happy at our purchase we made.  Thank you Stephen.< /text>

<Text>John helped me with my most recent purchase. He was fantastic!! Super knowledgeable, friendly and diligent. Not only did he personally handle my call and purchase, he even made sure to call me for a follow up. I highly recommend asking for John if you want to purchase at this location. He truly loves what he does and it shows in his extraordinary level of customer service. It’s refreshing now a days to find someone who enjoys their job and continues to go above and beyond for the client. Thank you John for your kindness and understanding. I sincerely appreciate you. -Tina<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Had a wonderful experience. At the entrance they check every person's temperature had hand sanitizers available before entering due to Covid 19. Then we were greeted by sales person Jordan Rodriguez. Jordan had helped us throughout the whole process. He helped us applied for credit through financing companies seeing which ones the right fit for us. Any questions we had was answered throughly and he was a very polite and honest guy. The furniture here was an affordable price and great quality. They have a huge in store selection for you to visually see it and feel it out in person. The store is clean and well kept up. I highly recommend Bob's Furniture as well as salesperson Jordan. All in all I give them an A+++, I'm one satisfied customer. I will sure be back again for future purchases. THANK YOU!< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
We got a couch for our living room along with a centre table. At the time of purchase, the seller agent in the showroom made us buy a 5 year "goof proof plan" which will cover all 'accidental damages', 'accidental gouges' and anything which would happen to the couch and the table. It has been one year now and we see the spring of the mattress inside the couch has withered away with multiple small lesions or stress tears and the mattress isn't in shape anymore, additionally the table has multiple small scratches and chipped side due to small accidents. We contacted customer care and filed a claim for these and now the claims department has notified us that these damages won't cover any of these scratches, marks, chips, mattress or the tears. Different words have been used such as all scratches are covered but scratched due to 'heat' are not covered as part of the program. To an end customer, this is just deception. If you cannot repair then you should not sell these things. Additionally, when we called the store to ask if we could purchase new seats for the couch, they said they are out of stock and can only 'sell' us the seat covers but they will be available only in November. Wow! This was a waste of our money and time in believing in Bob's furniture. I would rather waste my money elsewhere.</Review>

Kendyll was a great sales associate! She helped me pick out a mattress cover and went into detail on why it was a great option for the mattress I just purchased. She also was very informative with pricing/warranty info on the dining set I purchased. Super friendly and made shopping fun! 😊< /text>

<text>They have great deals and their staff to help purchase it is amazing. But if you want all of your furniture to come in when they say it will then don't come here. A couch was suppose to be ready mid August, they said it got on backorder and it won't be ready until September and now it won't ready until December. Bar stools that were suppose to be delivered on August to September to now October...yeah I'm canceling that. Don't come here. Ashley furniture has good options and your furniture will be delivered on time.
-edit: its been a month and now our couch won't come in until December and box spring for our mattress will come in late November...<//text><rating>1< /rating>< UserId.>

<Text>Prices are good and products are decent.  However, they are dishonest about their back order dates.  They got my business through deceit.  I was told at most it would take 5 weeks for my couch to be delivered. I was also told that usually only takes 3 weeks. After 5 weeks no one contacted me.  After unsuccessfully trying to talk to someone on the phone, I went into the store to find out that my couch was back-ordered for an additional 10 weeks!  Of course they blamed it on COVID.  However, we were already 6 months into the pandemic when I ordered, they knew that times where being delayed.  They should have prepared for this, and they should have been up front about possible delays at the time of purchase.  At the very least, someone should have contacted me before my initial 5 weeks were up and informed me of the additional delay.  Instead I had to drive one hour to find out that I know need to wait two more months for my couch.  Way to blow it Bob's of Fresno.  Corporate customer service is pretty worthless.  I have reached out to them multiple times and have never gotten a response.
Would include a picture of my couch, but I am still waiting for it.. 10 weeks later... Only 5 more to go!</Text><Rate>2< /Rate><Name>Spencer Voglin</Name><user_id>107526962629363200891</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Yesterday, one of the sales associates Janet was very friendly and helpful during our search and today we came back to make our purchase of a dining table, bench, & chairs set. Our sales associate this time was Cross and he was amazing! He was friendly, personable, & answered all of my questions. I would recommend anyone looking for furniture for their home to go to Bob’s Discount Furniture before making any final decisions elsewhere.</review>< pictures>

I was apprehensive about shopping here but our salesman Cross was amazing! He was very helpful without being pushy or stalking us through the store while we were looking around.  The furniture is good quality and we actually purchased a couch. Their warranty program seems good...5 years for anything from stains to actual breakage of the frame. Their prices are reasonable as well.</Review>

The only thing they need to make sure of is that they send more than one person out to load furniture. My husband had to help lift a really heavy chair, after saying he was disabled & that’s why the manager agreed to send workers out to load it for us. Now he’s having back pain because of it.< /Review>< pics>

We've been there 3 times already had have yet to find a good dresser with deep drawers.  They seem to appear like large drawers,  but when you open them up,  they're very much smaller. We finally went to Ashley Furniture and found not only a dresser,  but a chest drawer that was perfect! And we happened to get them both for 50% off, they also set up in your house,  and I purchased a 5 year warranty! Perfect!!< /text>

The worst customer service. Failed on the date estimated by four weeks.  You can't ever reach a person to call or talk to. While they have salesperson standing on the show room floor doing nothing but waiting for customers to walk in. 100% phone automated. They must not value their customers after they got your money. I will never recommend them nor will I purchase my living room set from them this year.<//text>

Very disappointed in their service. Promised that our $2000 bed would arrive in 6 weeks and no one ever contacted me so when I finally called them they said it would be another month... maybe. They don’t actually know and no one ever thought to let me know. I canceled the order and will never buy from them again. Super unprofessional and very unhelpful.

I will say that working with Jordan was the only good experience I have had there.

But now after canceling the order they will not refund the full amount. I have had to call them several times where I wait on hold for an hour and a half and then get disconnected and no one calls back. I’ve gone into the store to deal with it and they promise to take care of it and then don’t. And most recently after talking to a manager she said about $300 was refunded (of the $700 they still owe) and it never did go into my bank account even weeks later. But she said I’ll have to contact my bank because it’s not their problem. It’s getting worse and worse with these people!<//Review>

Frank was an awesome salesman! Bought a rocking/recliner and a new mattress! Furniture is reasonably priced...
Update, purchased a bed knowing one of the dual bases I wanted wouldn't be available until May 2021...get a call that they have my base (after I had paid) and it would all be delivered November 7th, 2020...got an email confirmation, the day arrived and I get a call from the delivery truck that they only have the 2 encasements no mattress,  no frames!! I had to call Bob's twice!! Over a hour each call, apparently they never had my base, it was a lie! Just requested my money back....I don't think I will ever shop here again...another store can have my nearly $6,000 purchase!</Text>

Love the prices, came here to buy a new desk so I can have more space to get my paper work done for work.  The only thing I didn't like is I have to wait 1 month and a half for it to come in. Seems like a long time to wait.</review>

I had finally found my perfect couch and was beyond excited, I paid $1,000 and was supposed to pick the couch up the next week. When I showed up to pick up the couch they had told me they only had half the couch, it was a chaise and love seat, the love seat was available but the attached chaise wouldn’t be available until August. Well August rolls around and still no word about my couch so I gave them a call to be told it would be here on the 20th, on the 20th I called and was told it wouldn’t be here until the 27th, the 27th I called and hip hip hooray the chaise is here and I can come pick up, we borrow a truck and make arrangements to come get the rest of our couch that we’ve waited 2 1/2 months for, we showed up and was told we couldn’t pick up today because the warehouse guy isn’t there. Communication could have made this whole thing so much easier but this company completely lacks in that department. I thought about buying a dresser but figured it would come with out the drawers and I would have to wait another 3 months. 👎🏻<//review>

<review>So far the customer service has been horrible.  Please stop blaming the pandemic.  I work in the public field and I manage to contact and communicate with my clients.  I am waiting for my delivery and I could not get in touch with anyone to find out what was being delivered.  (We ordered a lot of items.)  My salesperson told me, "I will call you each week with an update.  Here's my number."  Yeah right.  I have been calling and waiting online and on the phone for at least 20 minutes where I finally gave up.  If you want good furniture and to be able to talk to a live person regarding you purchase, it won't be here!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>The in store purchase went fine until the end, oh that will be a 6 week delivery. That sucks. Couches finally arrive 7 weeks later. Comfortable but one of the recliners does not work. To call into the store it’s a 30 minute wait just to talk to someone. After 45 minutes the system kicked me out. It’s not that hard to hire someone to talk on the phone.<//Text>< pictures>

Bought twin beds on Sept 7th, 2020. Picked up two weeks later only to find out headbboard was needed to assemble even though associate Barret said it was not needed as the headboard came in two pieces. This was not the case, plus they gave me the wrong rails. Returned items myself and had to pick up loaners. Beds were delivered finally in December 2020 for free, again wrong rails and could not accept delivery. Store manager ordered items returned to the store to see himself that rails and bed did not match(as of jan 17th 2021 he has not received them). Called customer service and store manager Raffi offered free delivery again to compensate. This after about 5 trips to the store, picking up and returning once. Raffi was supposed to call back after two days and weeks later no call. Went in and talked to Raffi and Hector. Said they would compensate me for troubles. Today, Jan 17th, 2020 called back to check on status. Items still not in. Finally gave up on original purchase and just decided to keep loaners, but needed a dresser since loaners did not have built in drawers like original purchase. Was given 150$ credit towards purchase of dresser and had to pay difference of 42$. Wow way to make things right. Now, i have to wait until feb 23rd 2021 to receive dresser. Associate Leslie leaves me a voicemail reading back my email as “P” as in pig. What a professional. Very disappointed, would not recommend. Delivery delayed, incorrect product delivery, poor customer service, etc.< /Text>

Hector and Jordan were so efficient and quickly helped me with measurements, lowest prices and delivery dates. One of the chairs I liked was priced at $399 and they sold it to me for $149 because it was the last one. I really appreciated the good service.</Review>< pictures>

A bit pricey, and have to wait for your purchase. They have to send for it at their warehouse.<//text>

<Review>I’m at lost for words. I see so many great reviews on here, but unfortunately I didn’t have the best experience with Bobs. I made a purchase online July 19, 2020. I never received an email that my purchase was in process. I waited another week, ive emailed and no response. I had to call again and for some miracle, I was able to speak to a sales rep. I was told that I’m scheduled for a delivery tomorrow 08/15/2020, but with the lack of communication, I’m afraid that they will not follow through. I was told I would get a call to let me know the time frame as to when I will get this delivered, but no call, no voicemail, no email. I even tried going on the website to expedite my delivery and when I put my phone number in, it’s said it didn’t exist. I’m quite disappointed with the lack of communication.< /Review><user_id>107117723156970322183< /user_id><Rating>1<//Rating>< GmapID>

<Review>We made our first visit a few months ago just to kill some time while waiting for a plane due to a flight delay. We were greeted and just looked around for about 45 minutes. We told them we were just looking and they gave us our space, no pressure at all. After our trip I continued to download their app, shop and compare quality and price with several other stores.

Fast forward to last week when we made a special intentional trip to their store to get a visual of the bed I was thinking of purchasing.
A sales person greeted us and introductions, again no hard sales and any questions we had were answered quickly. The prices were so good and Ericka was very knowledgeable about the product and a pleasure to work.
By the time we left we had decided she would be our sales person for any future purchases.

If I was to deduct any stars it would be for the undisclosed "Recycling Fee" tacked on to the invoice and the delivery fee which tacked on approximately $300+ ....

Let me also say that unless you are paying cash their first avenue of financing is with (wait for it)
"Wells Fargo" the biggest and quit possibly the most hated predatory financier in the country.
Needless to say we did not finance with them but did purchase an absolutely beautiful and comfortable bed from Bob's ... it will be delivered by mid month so I will be adding to this review after we see how long it takes and the total delivery experience.

So far.... I will be totally refurnishing our home from this store.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<text>The salesman was great, but when we ordered he said both items would be there within two weeks. The first item arrived on time, but the box was in horrible condition(luckily the item was fine) however, the second item was supposed to arrive the following week and when we called they said it wouldn’t be in for another month. Most places are struggling to get product in so that’s understandable, but don’t tell your customers it will be a quick turn around. They blamed it on coronavirus which is not a good excuse.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Time>1597804389766< /Time><rate>1</rate><text>My wife and I were initially impressed by size and cleanliness of store, shortly after that is where issue started. We walked in were temperature scanned and Given hand sanitizer then handed off to a sales person, after looking at 1 or 2 reclining sofas out sales person said he had to go help another customer to then left us there for 20 minutes until I asked manager to reassign new sales person which he did. We agreed on buying sofa and entertainment center which was said to be $799. (Couches were 3,900) sales person comes back and says oh no it was a mistake and it’s $999 at this point I get super frustrated and say if they won’t give advertised price I will leave takes several minutes and sales person comes back
Reluctantly gives 200$ off overall price to make competitive then we are told it wouldn’t be able to come until 8/19 20 days after we’ve moved in our new home without any couches or furniture. So we wait until today 8/18 at noon to be told 1/3 of our couch only would be delivered and rest would take more than 30 days more for us to get. Upon trying to ask store for discount was told they could only offer half off of delivery (150). That is a slap in the face on a 4800 order. At that time I requested a complete refund and to cancel the order. We originally paid half in cash and half on debit card. Employees lied and tried to not refund our entire amount mutliple times resulting in us being told the cash we paid would have to be sent back as a corporate check and would take 10-14 days to process. After agreeing only to find out they had once again lied and failed to refund our entire amount and having to go back on the phone at which time was told there will now be 2 separate checks we have to wait to process in the mail. In the mean time my family 2 children and I have to sit on the floor because of the lies and inability to do their jobs at bobs furniture. I will make sure no one I know ever makes mistake of being misled by them again.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I used to go to Bob’s in Connecticut so I’m happy to have one here locally. Bob’s makes buying furniture a little easier and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. When a piece we wanted was sold out for 6 weeks, our sales rep found us an even better alternative that happened to be on clearance so it fit our budget. He understood what we were looking for and made it happen.

They also had a greeter with hand sanitizer and a distanced temperature read. I appreciated their Covid consciousness.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Had a great experience while looking for a new bed. Barrett helped us find our way around the store, gave us space and time to look and made purchasing even easier. I left off a star because the assemble instructions weren’t the clearest and we had some difficulty but overall love our bed and will definitely be going back when needing more furniture.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809443871bea1707:0xa10a8c4d6c2db773<//gmapID></record>

<Review>I had fast and courteous service. I wanted a recliner and after trying several I found the one I wanted and was in and out of the store in no more than twenty minutes. Loved the service. Will recommend this store to my friends. Prices weren’t too bad either 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃</Review>< pictures>

<review>I love the couch my husband and I purchased. The reason why I give 3 stars is because the delivery was extremely late, our delivery was scheduled for 4:30 and did not arrive till 8pm. When we called the store the manager told us 6:30 our couch would arrive. After waiting a couple hours and multiple false ETA times later, we called for the manager to ask if it got cancelled or something. We were informed that the manager was busy loading up a couch in a truck so he couldn't get to the phone... 45 minutes later our couch arrived. So not only was our couch 3 and half hours late but they definitely forgot about our delivery and had to rush it out. We paid for the whole white glove delivery and we did not have that experience at all. All in all its a great couch but they're delivery system, and management needs to get it together.< /review><user>111876985026557078149<//user>< rating>

She helped me purchase a very lovely cream based sectional sofa and made sure I got the best price for it as well as what I specifically wanted. She was very patient and took the time to help my boyfriend and I pick out the very best furniture pieces for our new home. At Bob's Furniture they offer delivery service on most items. Kendyll helped me out by guiding me towards receiving that service due to my busy schedule. Kendyll was very patient and understanding when it comes to guests and always kept me updated on my items of purchase. I work out of town so receiving that was the most up-front and most kind gesture I could receive at the time. If you are looking for great guidance on purchasing furniture please come by and visit Kendyll.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

<Review>KENDYL is amazing assistance; No pressure, extremely knowledgeable, and completely passionate about all the items on the floor. I'm on the market for a home work table (thanks covid) and I'm "disappointed" that I made Bob's Furniture my 1st stop because now I'm on the market for a new bed, dining room table, and of course the office desk. It's all because Kendyl took notice of what I need and like, while applying them to their elaborate tour. If you get to Bob's furniture, ask for Kendyl.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Cross was great! We have been to almost all of the furniture stores in Fresno. So we’ve been helped by a lot of different people, Cross was BY FAR the nicest sales person we came across while shopping for furniture. We’re happy with our purchase, we have to wait a few months for our dining table but we loved it so much it’s okay. And our baby was crying and so fussy when we went and Cross had so much patience.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Pregnant and Satisfied customers!! Jordan did the upmost best customer service, I've ever experienced with any furniture market. We were having a problem with our furniture order, always delaying and on backorder. Due to covid. We went to Bob's and expressed our concern every rep we came across ,prior to JORDAN, told us we need to deal with 1-800# to solve the issue. I was ready to file a complaint because I'm 5 months pregnant sleeping only on a matress. Making it super hard and dangerous to get up and down. My husband decided we need to go talk to someone in the store and fix this. We were introduced to JORDAN without getting super upset with him and letting my pregnancy emotions show, he immediately responded with I'm so sorry and I will make sure you both leave satisfied. He spoke to managment and within minutes we left VERY SATISFIED. No need to get in dept, all in all. We are just so happy to move forward. Because of Jordan we are proud customers of Bob's furniture. We are so appreciated of his concern and his ability to make things work. Thank you again JORDAN you saved Bob a customer.<//Review>

I ordered a couch from this location almost 2 weeks ago. I never received my 2 bottles of GoofProof Warranty Solutions that were included in the additional $98 I paid. I've waited on hold and can't get through to anyone. I am extremely unhappy with this portion of my service. Everything else was great.</Text>

We had such an amazing experience at Bob's. We went there twice in 1 week. And walk away with a great deal and furniture we fell in love with. Janet and Cross were amazing thru the whole process. I would highly recommend this furniture store for a great deal and fashionable furniture for your home.<//Text>

<UserId.>117800485798079587440<//UserId.><review>Ricardo was a very respectful and courteous man . I walked into big bobs for the first time ever with my wife. Ricardo greeted us and simply exchanged names and said he was available if we needed his assistance. He also wanted to make us aware of all amenities offered in the store. Ricardo periodically checked in on us and he was sincere and professional. We didn’t get the typical vulture feeling like you do at other stores or when car shopping. Once we knew what we wanted and went over questions we wanted to asked we ran into Ricardo again and he was more than helpful he even checked every option he could to see if we could get our furniture to us faster such as checking if powered recliners were in stock instead of the manual ones we wanted. Ricardo was very detailed and ensured we had explored all options and went into detail to make sure we were completely satisfied  with our decision and purchase . I would definitely recommend and return to bob bongs because of Ricardo . Thank you for your outstanding performance sir!<//review>< gmapID>

<Text>If I can give this place 0 stars I would. Not only the sales associate Janet  messed up our first order, but they continue to make mistakes. We wanted a full bed  set and she orders us just the headboard and mattress. Then when we went back to purchase the remaining set, they charged us 4 times when there was no need to charge me since I paid cash. When I pointed out that there was no need to charge my card, they had no excuse to give me on why they charged me but just responded that it was a mistake. They left me negative in my account and was not able to return the charges until weeks later. I couldn’t dispute the charge due to it still pending. When I thought the nightmare was over, I get an email saying I’m only receiving the rails and the footboard was never placed to be delivered. I called to see why that is and the Jeremy tells me sales associate forgot to schedule our footboard for delivery. He then blames its because she’s new. I will be returning all items and items I have still not received. I will never buy from here again and if you are okay with getting the run around then continue to do business with them.</Text>< pictures>

I did not want to be bothered by the sales associate trying to sell me something I don't want. When my husband and I walked in, we were greeted by Erica who was nice and friendly. She introduced herself and just let us know that if we needed anything to let her know. She did check in with us once, but that was it. Bob's had great prices as well!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE. WE PURCHASED A MASSAGE CHAIR THAT WAS BROKEN. IT DIDN'T WORK AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT OF THE BOX. I HAVE BEEN WAITING CLOSE TO 3 MONTHS FOR THE REPLACEMENT.  THEY KEPT NOTIFYING US THAT IT WAS DELAYED. I FINALLY SAID I WANTED MY MONEY BACK. I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND IT HAS TO BE PICKED UP. WEEKS UNTIL THEY CAN GET IT AFTER WAITING AND KEEP GETTING PUSHED BACK. MOST LIKELY THIS WILL BE PUSHED BACK TO.</Review><GmapID>0x809443871bea1707:0xa10a8c4d6c2db773</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was greeted right when I came in from there they had a sales rep asked questions but I knew what I wanted and was given the pros an cons of receiving the cup holder and a 5 year warranty. I like the fact I was given all the options but I choose what fit my style.<//Text>

Jordan was great! He wasn't pushy or biased like some sales people can be trying to make the most money. He spent a lot of time with me making sure I got exactly what I needed. They have great selection at an excellent price point. I will definitely be going back for future furniture purchases.</text>

Bob's Furniture is having their Grand Opening this Saturday, my wife and I decided to go and see where it was located so we could be prepared.. to our Surprise it was Open! We were immediately greeted and were told to "help ourselves to coffee & ice cream" while we looked around.
Larry, one if their sales representatives, introduced himself and let us know that he would be available if we had any questions. He was awesome, he was knowledgeable and extremely polite, but above all he didn't hover over us. He gave us a chance to walk the store, he wasn't pushy, and he was incredibly easy to talk to. If we had a question and he wasn't sure of the answer, he went and asked someone who did.
Overall we had a wonderful experience, the Manager's Kim and Hector were also helpful, they were approachable and made sure that we were being well taken care of.. we were
Bob's has a great selection of bedding, couches, and kitchen tables. Their prices are reasonable and payment option's are available. We had a great time shopping, we bought a set of couches that are perfect for our new place. We highly recommend Bob's Furniture, and make sure you ask for Larry< /Review>

<review>Had a great experience here so far. Frank helped us out and made the process very smooth. He did not pressure us at all but still made sure we left with what we really loved. I felt comfortable telling him what I liked and didn’t like. Overall, a great experience, quality of the product appears really good, and pricing is very competitive. Praying the delivery is just as smooth.</review><name>Briseida Estrada</name>< user_id>

Great selection of furniture. The store is quite large and they seem to have a lil bit of every kind of style you might be looking for. The quality of the furniture looked to be of good high quality craftsman ship. The prices are very very reasonable for what they offer. After looking at this cabinet (which I forgot to take an overall pic of) I figured out I really like mango wood furniture. The staff was very friendly & didn't hover over you but were always available quickly to answer a question. Definitely going back to do some more looking around.< /text>

<review>I came across Bob’s store as I was searching Google for a new vanity. Online, I noticed their selection was great so the very next day I went into their store. They are new to Fresno and had only been in the area for 2 months so I was eager to check out a new spot. When I pulled up to the store, a red carpet was laid out front which immediately captured my attention. The moment I walked into the store I received a warm greeting from all 3 employees who were waiting patiently in the front. I shared with them what I was looking for and one of them, Fernando, happily showed me where to find the vanities I came into find. Giving me just enough freedom to explore the inventory on my own, he was also there to answer any and all questions I had. I loved the quality and experience so much that I ended up purchasing not only the vanity, but the entire bedroom set to match. I didn’t need the bedroom set for another 7 months but I was able to work out this way because of their extremely flexible scheduling and delivery program. They work with you and will ship to your home or in store whatever time you need them. They also offer very flexible  financing options so just about anyone can buy from their store. I was beyond impressed and perfectly confident in my purchase. I am so eager to use my new bedroom set on a daily basis as it will remind me of the pleasant experience I had with Fernando at Bobs Discount Furniture Store. Highly recommended. 🌟<//review>< Response>

This place is a great place to buy furniture. We purchased a dinning table with a removable leaf to make the table smaller. The prices were also very good. You can swap in certain sets from a bench to all chairs. You can also choose from upholstered chairs or wooden ones in the set we purchased. All the seating is made of memory foam as well! Ricardo  was our sales associate and he did a wonderful job explaining the furniture to us.<//Review>

<Text>This is the first and only place anyone should go to for furniture! I used to shop at mom and pop shops to find people who cared with affordable prices, but now I just go to Bob's for an easy and fun way to shop. I've already bought side tables, accent chairs, a dining table that serves 8, and a bed set! I'll continue to come back!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<text>This place is awesome!!!! There's so much furniture to chose from and different colors in each model they have on the floor. The prices are almost half of what Ashley furniture is and the quality is good too. I bought a table, couch and rug from there. There's also an optional insurance for the furniture that you pay one time at checkout that covers damage repairs and stains and if they can't fix it they send you a full refund of the cost that you bought it at and that insurance lasts 5 years. Great prices friendly sales people with patience to help you find what you want without all the hidden fees in the end</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_RBSkYwnQkBc64M9tFLNA9RvL00New1WZo42e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Wow Bob's Discount Furniture has a great selection of furnishings, super friendly staff, and a little Cafe area to keep the kiddos busy. But, what I like most of all are the prices, after doing lots of price checking at different furniture stores here in town, Bob's had the best pricing hands down. I am definitely buying my furniture at Bob's</Text>

The price , and furniture is great. But I had so many problems is crazy. We put  a $400 holding fee  to hold our  furniture for the next day ,since I forgot my license to apply for credit. We were told that we will receive our money back CASH the next day as well. We went back the next day to finance and we couldn’t receive our money. Apparently we had to wait for a check to come in. Plus the lady didn’t even apologize she left it all to the salesmen. Second , some of our furniture was incorrect. Called, they said I had to call back the next day. Called again , gave me another number to call. Finally able to work it out. 3rd they didn’t add my apartment number to the finance. Called the store again , lady said to wait a bit longer and that if I didn’t receive anything to call the store back. Called again gave me another number to call. And finally got it situated. They may be new at what they do , but damn! Not sure why they had me give them a call back and when I did it was only to give me another number.< /Text>

<review>Great place, they just came to Fresno. Found it great the owner throws his name on everything because it shows the product he is proud and willing to stand behind it. Love that the place is nice and open with plenty of options for any of your needs of furniture. Got a love seat and sofa for the price of what other places were trying to sell just a sofa for without delivery or a 5 year warranty. I had Lisandro help me and he was funny and charming as all good salesmen are but he truly was great we had loads of questions and were a little picky. If you need furniture you should definitely check this place out first and save yourself some time and money.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My husband and I went out today to purchase a new couch and a new dining set. We went to 3 other stores before finally ending up at Bob's. From the moment we walked in we already felt better about this store. The sales team did not follow us around the entire time but were available for any questions we had. We were able to browse the store without someone over our shoulder trying to make a sale. We found what we were looking for and had the pleasure of working with Fernando. He was very helpful and was able to answer every question we had and addressed all of our concerns him and the store manager gave us a great deal and we left so happy with our purchase. We will definitely be back in the future.</Review><rate>5< /rate><Gmap_id>0x809443871bea1707:0xa10a8c4d6c2db773< /Gmap_id><UserId.>106329598617193931362< /UserId.><name>Erma Aguilar</name>< time>

I purchased a set of dining, living and kitchen furniture. I got the half a week later and second load in 3 weeks. The delivery guys were horrible with making scratch on my newly installed floor despite of my warning. Then they poked the kitchen table and screws passed through 4 corners of table. Then there was back and forth to the store. Second delivery I got the wrong side table again. It's the worst furniture store like most of the other stores in Fresno. I will never go there again. No wonder you barely see people shopping there.<//review>< Pics>

Great buying experience, we were greeted at the door by our  sales person Frank Ortiz and was immediately shown what we came in to look for. He was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. Because there was no pressure to buy that day, we came back two days later and purchased the item that we were looking for.< /text>

<review>I just moved to Fresno and was looking for new furniture. I'm not really picky but was definitely also keeping my eyes open for my perfect red couch. Tough to find for sure in a sea of grays and beiges without having to spend a ton.

Enter Bob's. I wandered in and was greeted so nicely and offered help by Jordan. I asked him if they had red couches, expecting a sad laugh with a no like usual, but he remembered seeing one in inventory in the past. He went online and found me Jessie in red! Jordan made sure to check that it was still available to order and walked me through the ordering process. The price was a steal for my perfect combo of aesthetics and comfort.

I brought my husband back, and Jordan and his orientee helped us pick out a recliner to finish out our living room. Delivery of everything was scheduled for as early as possible on this Saturday, and they did not disappoint!

The whole experience was fantastic, and I love my new living room!! Oh and bonus - they have ice cream and coffee at the Fresno store!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Great experience! We were helped by Fernando Lopez who was very nice and knowledgeable about the store's products. There was also no pressure by him or any other staff into making a purchase while we browsed but he was also at our service when it came to answering any questions we had. With this good service and wide variety of well-priced furniture to choose from we were able to find a set of couches that we liked and decided to buy. We will definitely keep Bob's at the top of our list when it comes to future furniture purchases.<//review><resp>None</resp>< name>

Stopped by Bond furniture the other day and was instantly greeted by a friendly associate. He told me his name was Fernando. He asked me a few questions about what I wanted and made sure he got the specifics so he could show me the top choices for what I was looking for. He made sure I was completely satisfied with my purchase and answered the million questions that I had. I would love to shop here again for anything else I may need.</text>

Even my UNCLE was very please and amazed with the furniture. Thank you, with the help of my uncle I was able 2 established my credit. What was more amazing the cafe area they have for there customers, 3 different flavors of ice cream assorted candy sweets besides Bob's cookies four different flavors of coffee besides water, TV  while you're waiting to get approved and also they provide area to charge your phone. Hope 2 see Bob's in Visalia soon. On Tuesday July 16, the mattress & box spring were delivered and was set up. The 2 delivery guys were very respectful courteous and answered any questions I ask very well.  Thank you Elizabeth Cabrera  & Ricardo Leos<//text>< time>

This is an unprofessional place. They promised our living room set to be delivered within two weeks. Two months have gone by and they can’t give us a delivery date yet. Poor customer service and manager seems unable to handle the store. Guys, do business somewhere else.<//review>

Sales rep Ricardo asked if I wanted White Glove delivery when I was purchasing a dining set. He explained how it worked and I agreed to get it. Boxes were dropped off this morning and when I inquired about the install the delivery guys said they were only dropping off. When I called Bob's to see if a separate team was coming to install, I was told that I didn't order White Glove delivery. I was transferred to customer care who ended up telling me they would be willing to charge me for the service but won't be able to send anyone out til Tuesday next week. Guess I'll be putting everything together myself. Very frustrating.<//Text>

<Review>The store experience was great. Cheryl was very personable and nice. The product experience was the worst I've ever experienced. Their customer service line is full of inexperienced people who say the complete opposite of the person you last talked to. Delivered 2 faulty mattress bases and now they won't exchange for a 3rd. I said I wanted a full refund and they told me I have to wait 30 days when they paperwork says you have 30 days to return. Contacting corporate. Buyers beware. Vibes of scam everywhere.</Review>< Name>

I came up with a good idea there. And I met this lady who taught me how to check to see if they sell good furniture. It really seems like high quality furniture for a goodish price. The only bad thing was they have ice cream there and no one told me about it until I was leaving but they did say to help myself. And you can really test the furniture there with no judgment. The sales person I met, Jordan, was very helpful and welcoming. I hope this helps you make a good decision. “But, you don’t have to take my word for it”-Levar Burton<//text>

<Text>Went in and was going to purchase 2 chairs, server, nesting tables, and TV trays. They could not find a price for the TV tray. We waited 45 minutes and told them we would come back at 3pm. The sales associate promised us a discount. We came back and they were still not ready with a price. We waited another 30 minutes and had to leave. They promised they would call us once they found the price. 2 weeks later and they never called. We in and they apologize for not calling and said they were not able to find a price and removed it from the floor. They also would not honor the discount they promised.< /Text>< pics>

Our Sales Associate, Ricardo Gatica screwed us royally. He said that we were suppose to get a delivery on Saturday. We received an email that stated we wouldn’t get our delivery until the following Wednesday. We just moved into our new home and this bedroom furniture is for our 2-year-old daughter. We understand that mistakes happen. We are disappointed that Ricardo didn’t call us ahead of time and inform us that he incorrectly wrote our order. Unfortunately, Ricardo’s mistake is causing us a huge delay in regards to receiving our purchase, and a big inconvenience to our rearranged schedules.

I would like to know why that when a brand new mattress is brought from a you, and we ask for you to take the old mattress, my sister was told no - So she called you folks today and was now told it is because we did not have a white glove delivery - COME ON NOW - REALLY!!!!!!!

We did our research and it does state in the state of California, retailers must pick up the old mattress and box spring for FREE!!!! if a consumer asks for it upon the new mattress being deliver - my sister just spent  lot of money to buy a new mattress with king size headboard and you can not do this simple little thing??????

Well, it is suppose to be deliver tomorrow, (Sat, 11/8/19) - told my sister maybe you should cancel the sale and go somwhere else that will pick up like the furniture store I brought my bed from - Sorry, a little disappointed

Please "MR OWNER" whomever you are that comments in the google reviews, do NOT send us to some survey web site to fill out some survey, just get this issue resolve in Fresno, Ca. PLEASE!!!!!< /Review>

I’ve had problems getting furniture from this place since my purchase day, which should have been my cue not to buy from here.

My delivery for in store pick up was delayed 3 weeks, without notification. I was scheduled to pick up 5/23 and received a call on 5/19 saying it was ready. I drove 20 minutes to the store just to be told it wasn’t there. The day of my scheduled delivery, 5/23, I drove another 20 minutes just to be told again that it wasn’t there and would for sure be there next week. I never received a call so I called in myself, just to be told it still wasn’t there. I tried to be very understanding and then I got walked over. The general staff is very kind but management was impossible to reach and was supposed to call me on Tuesday 6/4 and I never heard anything. It’s now 6/6, and because I called in I’m finally receiving my dresser.

I will never purchase anything from this location again.</Review>

<Text>Walked into Bob's for the first time last week and felt like family. Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff and no high pressure. We checked out the store and was extremely pleased with the quanity and quality of merchandise and the pricing seemed great. We looked at several other stores but kept coming back to Bob's. By our third visit we had finally decided and made our purchase. We will be back soon to purchase additional items.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Honestly the worst place to buy your furniture!!!! Our bill keeps going higher and managers can’t do anything about it we have talked to multiple mangers over the issue and they simply say they can’t do anything about it. Our bill is now $500 more then the first time how is this even possible. The quality of the furniture is not the best. To many issues with this company will never shop here again and will not recommend it to anyone!!!!! We live 2 hours away from the location and the sales representative have made us go in four times and nothing get solved! Horrible service.</Text>

My family and I had a great first time experience at Bob’s furniture store. Great customer service right when you walk in as you get welcomed by an employee that offers free gifts. Ricardo Morangatica was really nice and helpful throughout the whole process of choosing what was right for my body and health. Ricardo showed me all the amazing features that will come with my bed and I did not feel pressured to buy anything at all. Tyfannie Robinson helped me fill out my credit application and it was really fast as well. She made sure everything was correct and was also very nice. My family and I would definitely come back and shop here again.< /Review>

<Text>Huge place. Mediocre collection.

Prices cheaper than those of Ashley's across the street. But so is the quality of make.

Quality of material though seem to be at about the same level for both Ashley and Bob's. The staff, however, appears to be more friendly/smiling at Bob's. May be because they are still new and green.😉</Text>< gmapID>

I waited 3 weeks for my couches and rented a trailer to pick them up.  Upon arrival the manager told me that our furniture was not available and his paperwork had us picking it up in one week.  Luckily we had the receipt with us and 2 messages from the store telling us to pick it up.  The manager just shrugged it off and told us he would have it delivered when it showed up.  2 hours later we got a call from the store telling us to pick up our couch.  We called to find out what was going on but the sales staff avoided our call and we had to call back twice to get someone to talk with us.  Very unhappy with the after purchase service, look up the rating with the BBB before you buy and ask them if they have a customer complaint line, they give you a number that goes nowhere.</Review>< Pics>

Cheryl Spaulding, sales associate met me at the door. She showed me the chairs first as my husband was in the car. She offered to help him with a wheel chair. She went above and beyond and came to the car and assisted him into the store.
Cheryl was very personable, caring, a great personality and made sure the chair he choose was the right fit. She was very knowledgeable about the chairs. Material, padding, mechanisms, warranty. She explained the history of Bob’s.
Not only did we purchase a chair  we will return when we need furniture and Cheryl will be the person we choose to be our associate.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I absolutely will be returning to Bob's furniture in Fresno . My family and I had the best  Furniture shopping experience . Larry was the gentleman that help us out. His customer service was great very professional and very knowledgeable . I look forward to doing business with Bob's furniture in the near future.
in my personal opinion don't waste your time Fresno shopping anywhere else.  Bob's furniture is your one  stop shop !!! your furniture is ready to deliver in a couple of days , you dont have to wait weeks or even months to receive it . I'm am very satisfied with ya'll !!!!!</Review>

< review>
We  purchased an avenger double recliner and it was delivered on February 26 - the light in the center console did not work and tech came on February 29 to fix. Tech was unable to remedy the problem and we were told a replacement light would be ordered on APRIL 1, 2020. We asked that the display model on the floor, same color etc which was working be exchanged for the nonworking light and were told this could not be done. This is absolutely unacceptable customer service and we will never deal with Bob's Discount again.</review>

<text>Totally what we were trying to find...the furniture is actually really great quality that won't break down after a year of use (Mor Furniture...I'm looking at you!). The prices are really great too (Ashley Homestores...what's up?).

As someone who lived on the East coast and was privy to the early days of Bob's furniture when they were just a small local store with incredibly cheesy commercials I'm so happy they made their way out here. This is a very ethical and quality furniture store. I would say this beats the local competition for price from what I've seen.<//text>< Resp>

<review>Went in on July 11 and purchased furniture. Liked the fact they were not pushy and let me look. Found what we wanted and were able to finance it. Scheduled arrival of furniture was some end of July and rest of it was mid August. Chose to have it delivered all at once. However today we had to go in and cancel the order but planned to rebuy most of it and pay cash. Cancelled the order had our salesman Matt rework th order only to find out that because we cancelled the order this order was considered a new order and now wouldn’t be here until the 20 and 21 st of September. Really? We were told it goes in the order it was ordered. I get that, however I was rebuying that same furniture that was already ordered for me and almost here but because I cancelled it it was go to the end of the line. They were not even willing to work with us the answer was that’s Bobs policy. Sales person didn’t tell us this until we already cancelled it. So I took my 1600 hundred dollars and went to the competitor across the parking lot and spent my money there. So disappointed! Really like the furniture at Bobs but really did not like the attitude. Plus their delivery fee is outrageous. Not sure I will go back. So disappointing because they do have a large selection of quality furniture. Oh yes my new furniture will be here on Saturday.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1565490889770, 'text': 'We are so sorry that we were unable to get your order out to you in a timely manner.

Avoid this place at all costs. I had arranged to have furniture delivered on a particular date to my new address. Only part of my furniture arrived on the date that was arranged, and the other part was “lost in transit”, “never delivered”, and “delivered on the date that I did not agree to”. I asked to see the fedex invoice that was signed on the “delivery date”, and no one could show me the invoice. I asked for a refund on the item that I did not receive, and I was told I would receive a refund on that item. Two days later I receive an email that stated I have an order that is being shipped to my house. When I called to ask why this is happening, a representative stated that they would call me back to get more information about the incident, and to provide me with a tracking number to the item. I never received a call back. This place is unprofessional, and no one has ever given me a straight answer as to what happened to my furniture that was never delivered. I have gone in to the store, spoke to the manager, and called corporate, and still have not received a definitive answer. They also want to charge me for the furniture that I never received. Do yourself a favor and shop elsewhere. Bob’s furniture has only given me a headache.<//text>

Since i moved to a location which was around 150 miles away from the nearest store, they wont cover it fully and offered 30% refund.
After a lot of struggle, and many phone calls back n forth , i got them to cover the damaged furniture via store credit. A new order for a furniture almost 3 times cost of damaged furniture was placed and now the Fresno store wont deliver becoz my location is 150 miles away from the store. I was told they will only deliver if i ordered a truck full of furniture.  Really ridiculous.
Least co-operative staff i have ever seen. First they sell cheap quality furniture, make u buy goof proof protection and then wont deliver.

Thankfully customer service showed some kindness n offered 50%.
Had i not followed up regularly , I would have had to settle for 30% refund which barely covers anything.. I had to pay to $200 just to move the damaged furniture out of the house n recycle it. :(

Never gonna buy anything from them again. N wont recommend others as well< /Review><username>Prasad Shetty</username><time>1564303078153</time></record>

It’s been about Awhile since my furniture  was delivered . I was told my parts would be delivered and bobs would scheduled a person to complete my delivery and set up.  Noooooo one has called or been over my place to repair the broken bed frame and replacement parts that where not delivered and installed.
4/2019 was my purchase. I will never be back as a customer. Service and repair are a fat ZERO.< /text>

Im honestly really disappointed with them! We bought two couches and a dining table that ive been wanting for months! We took the couches home the same day. They said the dining table was going to take a week to order. Which was fine. But then at some point they messed up where the table got delivered to the store and the chairs somehow got delievered to a different store they said it would be another week to recieve them but now we got another call where now theyre saying its going to be ANOTHER week but if we wanted to get delivery it would be here on the 5th but if we wanted to pick up it would be the 12th which doesnt make any sense. Definitely wouldn't order through them again! Get it together. You guys dont even deserve 1 star</Text>

Lizandro and Oscar were great help the day of. But it was a nightmare to get our items delivered. Things kept getting back ordered and the day of delivery, they canceled. We had to cancel our entire order because nothing was in stock and deivery was not reliable.< /text>

We’ve been searching for not only the perfect sofa set, but also werelooking for great service and a store that would be our “go to” for future purchases. So it wasn’t a surprise when it took me weeks of research before finding Lisandro at Bob’s. He was ahhhhhmazzinnng! Totally down to earth, not your “typical salesperson” who wanted to sell you everything under the roof. He listened, made great suggestions, and he LET ME decide what was best for me. Service was beyond great. Would definitely be back to furnish the rest of our home. Highly recommend Lisandro and Bob’s.<//Text>
