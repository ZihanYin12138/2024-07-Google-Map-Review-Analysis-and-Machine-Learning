Had a transmission flush and oil change on my Jeep done.

Both motor and transmission have had problems ever since.

My motor has blown and transmission has leaked and had trouble shifting ever since the $268 service I spent at this location.

Update: I received an email from bay and gave him a call immediately, the call went to voicemail and I have yet to hear back or even have a conversation. I emailed again with no response.< /text>

These guys have been great and they do more services than the Pennzoil place in San Rafael, and much more enthusiastic & knowledgeable help. I've been here a few times, they caught a bold that was out and fixed it for a few bucks. They also clean headlights that got cloudy.< /review>

<Review>Stole change from my vehicle during service.  I had just changed out a few dollars for quarters, so I knew exactly how many quarters I had in my vehicle before taking it in.  When I confronted them about it they wouldn't admit they had taken anything, but they did refund the money "to make me happy".  This doesn't solve the bigger issue of theft and my now complete lack of trust in these individuals, so whoever took the money can just keep doing it to unwitting customers.  Criminals.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I had my oil changed at this Jiffy Lube and this is what happened: a month or so later, I heard a strange sound coming from under my car. When I looked underneath,  I saw a felt engine cover had come loose and was dragging against the pavement.  It was obvious that this cover had needed to be removed to gain access to the oil drain plug, and that the reason it had come loose was because it wasn't re-installed correctly when Jiffy Lube did their work.  I had to buy a new engine cover that cost me $60.  Be careful taking your car to this business.  They aren't meticulous about putting things back properly.</Text><user_id>107662382002049051668< /user_id>< pics>

<Text>***BELIEVE THE RATINGS*** This location had my 2016 Jeep Cherokee Laredo in early March for it first oil change. Purchased it January 2017. There attendant damaged the filter, resulting in my losing oil while traveling days later South on I-580. I was towed to McKevitt's dealership in Berkley **poor review also** were the diagnostic had been done and correctiin made. The very day of my breakdown I called JiffyLube to inform them of my situation. A tow from Oakland to Marin was not in my budget. I was informed tgat a manager would cotact me tge following Monday. The incident occurred on a Saturday. Mind you I was new to the bay area, no family, no friends near. My residents at the time was in Petaluma, so....Work in Marin, live in Petaluma, breakdown in Oakland, obvious at fault JiffyLube! I missed one week of work, my brand new vehicle still wreaks of burnt oil, JiffyLube General Manager Sol still has yet to return/contact me to resolve this claim/matter and today's daye is currently April 28 2017 Friday. If this business suits you, by all means take your vehicle. I am oy one dissatisfied customer. I already know of another.</Text></record></dataset><record>

So I ended going somewhere else.  Just went in their today and was stopped by the same guy as I was pulling up. He told me that they were out of filters and that I had to come back later.  I will never go back to this location.</Review><username>Tom Maracek< /username>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Lousy lousy service and slow to say no more.
They can't do what anywhere else if.

Pésimo pésimo pésimo servicio y lentos a decir no más.

<review>You know, these guys are great. I was greeted kindly and charged a fair amount for my repairs. I got a new seat post mounted with a clamp and a shiny new bike chain. They waived a couple little things, I appreciate that a bunch.... makes me want to come back. Beyond that, they’re cool and humble... not up against that vibe thing in some bike shops. Lastly, they’re fast... got my bike 36 hours later. I’m sure if I had pushed it, they would’ve sped things up but I wasn’t in a rush. Excellent experience. Xox</review>< Pictures>

I bought my beach cruiser here a few months ago and I still absolutely love it.  Great quality. It was well made and I’m happy I bought it here.  Service was stellar.  I came here twice before choosing my bike and I never felt rushed.  They helped me find the best bike for myself, had great inventory (during a bike shortage where everywhere else had little!), and were just all super helpful and friendly.  I highly recommend buying your bike here!<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Great experience at this bike shop. I called to see if they had what parts I needed and how much it would cost to install them they were easy to deal with and gave me all the info I needed. Dropped off the bike and it was ready in 2 hours! The store observed all Covid19 protocols, one customer at a time in the store, wearing of masks and social distancing. Glad they're in my neighborhood right on 4th west of Cherry Ave.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We bought two bicycles in this store with an excellent service.
Good price and quality. Days later we needed some adjustments on the bikes and this was resolved quickly and without bureaucracy.< /Text>

Love this shop!! I would highly recommend them for all your biking needs. Previously I had been using Pedal Movement in downtown Long Beach at the Metro Bus stations. Bike Your Way knows their stuff, they have great customer service. They are quick and their prices are out of this world and I'm a tough customer. Got my bike repaired and I"m in the process of buying a new bike for my friend there. It's close.<//review>

<Text>This shop is the best .  Excellent, well trained mechanics will go the extra mile every time.  If that is not enough the prices for overhaul and other work are VERY reasonable.  Service is just as good .  Highly recommend.< /Text>< Pics>

If you call they just say they have what you want. Then you get there and they dont have your size. Happened twice, with a tube a month ago, and with a tire today. Also had to wait 30 min when i got there because all of the employees had to take their lunch break at the same time. Stagger the lunch breaks and you dont have to close unannounced. Trash bicycle shop. These are the easiest things to get right and they cant.</text>

Support Small Businesses like this one! The owner was kind enough to help me out prior to his opening hours, the prices were straight forward, and he even held my bike safely over the weekend without charge. Even though it was my fault for not picking up the bike. My bike works perfectly and comes with a 30-day warranty on the fixed parts!</Text>

I have been customer for awhile and Oscar who moved on and handed shop to Tony are the best and Tony always goes the extra mile and more to help everyone. Candy is the icing on top as her  *Sweet~Beautiful~Face* is always smiling as she welcomes you when you walk in and asked "How can we help you" Candy makes "Bike Your Way" a pleasant experience and Tony is friendly and professional. Thanks guys your the best 💯 💖 😘< /Text>

<name>Amirsaleh Sharifi<//name><Review>They are selling junk with high price for their junks and no respect to client opinion after you pay, they will tell you bike has 30 days warranty but when you bring bike back to fix the problem they say it doesn’t have problem and we can not do anything for you, don’t buy bike from them , its only a shop to fix your bike minor issue nothing more</Review>< Rating>

Oscar was wonderful when helping me pick out my new bike. Plus, their prices can't be beat and when I need to get my bike serviced there it is always finished quickly and satisfactorily. Highly recommend this shop to anybody looking for quality service and a friendly, knowledgeable staff.</review>

Bought a Birthday bike for my good friend. Oscar was super helpful and was so professional and courteous, it gave this middle-age customer hope for his generation. You were a class act Oscar, thank you for your help and Anthony too since we exchange for an upgrade and he took great care of my friend.</Review>

I'm finding more and more that these small food trucks have great food. The same quality you will find in a fancy restaurant but without the high price or fancy dining. I went with the chicken quesadilla and it was great. Friends went with tacos and a burrito and they also loved it. Stop here for a quick bite to go or stay and eat and the tables they have next to the truck.</text>

< review>
I hired El Coyote for a private event and it was fantastic. The food was fresh (mango salsa!!), coordinating was simple (over text and phone) and the team (Jose, Angelica, Eduardo, Bertha) were all extremely friendly and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend this truck for private events. Really adds a fun element !< /review>

<Review>This is a nice little truck that was parked not too far from Train Town, and was the perfect place for our group to get lunch after a fun morning at the park. I had the asada burrito, which had fresh ingredients and a tasty salsa, but the meat was just a little overdone for my taste (some bits were even crunchy). No one else in my group seemed to have the same problem. The price was typical of most taco trucks, which is to say, pretty good.<//Review><Rate>4</Rate><Date>1561126581408< /Date>< name>

Price, quality, service and speed can't be beat! Need something to grab and go? This is the place! Call or text your order in advance if you can't be bothered to wait 5-10min. The staff here has great service and is always smiling.<//text>

<Review>Family run, great food, excellent service. What else could you possibly ask for? I've been going to El Coyote for the longest time and I have to say that it is hands down the spot to go to when hunger calls. The food is typically ready in 5-10 minutes depending on the size of your order. This truck is the place to go when visiting Sonoma!< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
Yelp reviews led us to book El Coyote taco truck come to our hotel Sunday morning after our wedding for much needed breakfast burritos, tacos, nachos, hotdogs for the kids and so much other amazing food! We booked without having tried their food and we lucked it. All my guests loved it. We were quoted for 50-75 people and about 90-100 people showed clearing out their food inventory! Jose and his wife are very nice and even brought us many gallons of horchata for our guests. You get complimentary chips and drinks and full size menu. Don't expect a signed contract, they work by phone.<//review>

< review>
This was my second time stopping by El Coyote while passing through Sonoma and just like the first time, I was blown away with the quality of their food. My girlfriend and I ordered 3 Carnitas tacos and 2 chicken tacos. Steam rolled out of the tin foil cover as we both opened our food and everything tastes so fresh. 10/10, I would highly recommend their tacos.</review>

<Review>Best food from a food truck I've ever had.  Coyote Burgers and Carnitas burritos with everything are to die for.  They brown the tortillas, and having eaten there at least 100 times, the food is consistent and excellent.  I dont write reviews, but this hard working family deserves recognition.  They speak English too.</Review>< Response>

(Translated by Google) So delicious !! Great customer service, service was quick and food was flavorful. They're rice, beans and asada tasted homemade.

The truth is that it is very delicious! The delicious taste of roast beef says it all. Good job !

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Not impressed.  Not the worst either.  Fried chicken is made fresh to order which is nice.  Comes out crispy and reasonably moist.  The sauce is what's so so for me.  Too mild without a lot of flavor.  Additionally it took about 30 minutes to get my SINGLE order of 8 piece chicken and white rice.  Got to listen to the two guys working the counter whole waiting so long and thier customer service needs serious work.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu4Fzv7o_-9pivbFtpj5ixxKPBvW4BlcCRekZ0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBMMCSKm5quohFvOZhkFw9IN_naOceYGgPK1E7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkSyiKM6yk7BWqG-ETuXrl1iKuV1nvtCpxHARG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcRl_Qv0d5CvOjsm09YZveh30MqlNilzwluyJp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5UKxUqiqMVJvgqxDRECoidNp2jwDgcBCn3832=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Driving home and found it was wrong order (cheeping boneless chicken). We had to drive back to the restaurant and ask for the correct food. The cashier was a young gentleman and expressed no apology or explanation. He just told us that we had to wait for another 20 minutes. It was another 25 minutes and we asked him again. We finally got the food. The food was okay but they should definitely improve their customer service.< /text>< pics>

Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with great sauce, can't go wrong! Only downside was the wait but it was a fun atmosphere especially with an ice cold bottle of beer! This place is poppin'<//Review>

<Text>I would give this more than a 5 star if I could, because this was amazing! We got two types of chicken and the waffle fries and calamari which was soooo good with the sauce that comes with it. It is worth the wait. Our kids were fighting for the last piece because it was that good. I dont get why other people are so picky, but as someone who travels and trys a lot of places around the states this is a must try!<//Text>< gmapID>

The title is a bit confusing since it's Korean fried chicken and not barbecue, but for what it's worth, this place is the best. The chicken is crisp and all the flavor is on point. As others have said the wait is a bit long, but everything is made to order, so I'd say it's worth it.

Also note worthy is their specials, they have good specials with their "friends" combo and such which offer chicken a side dish and a pitcher of beer. If you're in for lunch they have a nice simple lunch special which is 2 drum sticks and 2 sides.</text>

<Text>Their fried chicken is out of this world.  When it’s light and crispy, you know the oil used in frying chicken is fresh.  Their side of order of pickled daikon that comes with our Half n Half order is tiny, it’s not even enough for one person let alone for 2 people.<//Text></record>

<review>BBQ Chicken is the best Fried Chicken I have ever had in SoCal! They fry the drumsticks with olive oil and it tastes amazing! The hot sauce is very spicy and I recommend having the hot sauce as a side. Their fries is delicious as well. The prices are reasonable and their specials are definitely a full portion and will feed you pretty well.</review><Time>1576733267361<//Time>< gmapID>

<text>The staffs need to pay more attention to
what they do.
They forgot so many things such as, fork or chopsticks,napkins and the radish for take out.
The taste is not too bad, but too much MSG in it... will not visit again.<//text>< Time>

This was my first time coming to Dave's chicken sandwich from the Bay Area and this won't be my last time coming! My girlfriend and I ordered 2 Sliders W/ Fries and that was enough for both of us. If you like spicy food I would recommend "Hot" it isn't too spicy where you can't eat it.< /text>

Typical Korean chicken place where you wait at least 15-20 min to get your delicious fried chicken
We ordered half original and half sweet and spicy.
Original was delicious..hot and crunchy on the outside and tender/hot on the inside. The sweet and spicy chicken was not so great..it was more sweet and not spicy at all. will not order this again next time.
Mac and cheese looked good, but once it enters your moth, you realize how watered down it is.
Onion rings as great! Crispy and hot and did not fall apart after you bit into it. Honey mustard sauce with onion rings was perfect!
Korean rice cake was hot and cooked to chewy perfection but was not spicy.
Customer service was good.
Good for late night dinner or snack< /review>

This is our first time to visit this place and it was such a nice and delicious experience. Food was on point as well as the service and the owner is the absolute best! He came by our table and chatted with us after we ate and learned a bit about their history. Definitely a must try if in the area, will not be disappointed. We will for sure be back to try more dishes!< /text>

< Review>
I’ve had bbq quite a few times now and tried most of the flavors (I don’t order sides here since I only just eat the chicken). They’re all quite good and tasty but sometimes the chicken is a tad dry. Also they seem to not give you radish unless you ask so be mindful of that. Sometimes they don’t give it to you even if you asked in advance which is a faux pas.</Review>

<review>This place is a joke! This place doesn't even deserve a star!!  Very poor service. Manager is very rude and looks very angry. The cooks look like they hate their jobs. Food is bad. Place is dirty. I won't ever be doing back here again. Don't bother coming here  there is better restaurants around.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<text>The fried chicken here is as good as I have had anywhere. You have to wait as it is cooked for you but worth every minute!! It is fried in Olive oil with a unique blend of spices. This is the place for fried chicken....< /text>< pictures>

I don't get why this place is called BBQ Chicken, it throws me off because I come here for FRIED chicken, not BBQ. Anyways, this place is so good. I really enjoy Korean style fried chicken. If you come when it's busy, don't expect much service... actually even when it's not busy, there's not much service or attentiveness... but the food is good, really good! I love the breading and the oil they use to fry. Oh, but another down side is the wait for your food is longer than normal..... 3 stars.</review>

NO LETTING SERVICE DOG IN!!!!!!!
This place suck.
I went to here with my service dog. But they refuse me to get in, even I have the service dog certificate. This make me very angry and feeling helpless. This is how they treat disabled people.  I finally get in after I asked them do they know not letting service dog is illegal.  Their attitude is extreme bad.  I was just sitting there for  15 mins and they just ignore me. No water, No service, no nothing.
I'll never go to this pace ever again< /text>

<Date>1428119586817</Date><rate>4< /rate><Text>Chicken is not as flavorful as KFC. In fact the olive oil fried chicken seems to have no salt nor seasoning at all. Some people may like this simplicity, some may not. Their hot sauce chicken is nice. The hot sauce seems to contain a splash of sweet Thai chili sauce mixed in, which is nice. Note the entrees and sides come to the table at different times, as they're ready. Further note the table receives complimentary shredded salad with Asian thousand island dressing, so it's pointless to also order a side salad with your entree. Overall a nice place.< /Text>< Pictures>

Restaurant says it closes at 11 tried to order something at 10:30 guy with glasses stopped us in our tracks and would not let us order says kitchen is closed you can't order food here in front of the whole restaurant we drove very far to taste this so called great chicken. If you have customer service like that I can't imagine what the food taste like . Thumbs down for service and courtesy. Very disappointed and I will not be coming back.< /text>

<review>So I realized my last visit here was in 2008. And if a place has been around that long, it should've improved right?

The service was definitely better and they also have lunch specials now (even on weekends)

But we opted for the $20 Half and Half which was 5 pieces Olive Chicken and 9 pieces of Sweet/Spicy. I would've preferred it, if the 9 pieces were olive chicken though as the sweet/spicy gets overpowering.

The olive chicken was really good though, and had a super light batter.

It came with a bowl of radish cubes (love) and a plate of cabbage drizzled with thousand island.

Maybe it's just me, but regardless of olive oil preparation, anytime I want fried chicken, I'll still automatically think of Popeyes first. xD

But this place is good for KOREAN fried chicken with the super crispy light batter. Try the lunch specials first ;)<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

So, i called to order a half&half, but the person who answered my call was very rude. He yelled at me out of nowhere for no reason when all i wanted to do was order and pickup. I'm very disappointed about their customer service and hope to see improvements in the future.</text>

I don't understand how this shop still exists on the area. They make me never want to purchase their chicken any more.
Too RUDE. If I could give zero stars, I would.
Never, ever go there.

< Review>
****Update****

Ok, I have had it with this place. I have defended their bad service, but no more. It is so bad that I don't care how good it tastes, its now a bad experience. And I think the chickens are getting smaller. Barely any meat on the birds! No ice in drinks, no service for refills, no more cabbage salad, loud and noisy, dirty, disorganized. I asked for tabasco sauce and they said they are out.

Previous review:

I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love it because the olive oil whole plain chicken is so good. I have tried so many places and this place has the best tasting chicken. The batter is flakey and crispy. Chicken is moist, Its a unique coating on this chicken. I love the free pickles and the free cabbage salad you get as well.

Why they call it BBQ chicken is beyond me. It should be called Fried Chicken?

But the service is so sub par. They always forget to bring out the free radish pickles and cabbage. I always have to ask. Why??!! It's such a simple process. I seriously have had to ask the last 5 times we have eaten here. It's not like it's a complicated menu for the people to learn and remember!

I also hate how they are so stingy on ice in the drinks. Props for giving you huge cups for soft drinks, but always so little ice. And they will refill your drinks without an issue, but more often than not, they wont refill ice unless you ask.

I want to give this place more stars so they stay in business because I love the chicken. All they need to do is provide better customer service. This place changes owners often. They just repainted the inside. I don't know why they keep spending the money on things that don't matter (repainting the decorations on the inside) vs providing better customer service.

Stop having such young kids work the store. Time for some adults to provide customer service!

<Review>First off BEST CHICKEN EVER the quality is great and dont get me started with their hot sause. Reason im giving a 3 star is because of the staff. They are ALWAYS short handed, i mean all the time. Also they are quite "cheap" as i order 20pcs of wings plus 5 pcs of tenders and all they give is a SINGLE small container of sause which holds about enough hot sause for about 5 wings plus they dont even fill it all the way. And they charge for extra sause. Also the staff is sometimes very very rude, more specificly one guy but i dont wanna call him out. We asked him one night to bust a table so we could sit as their were no other tables. His straight response was "i dont have time for that" and litterly walked away. Aside for the horrible staff and long waits their owner is nice and food is amazing, my advice is to always get takeout.< /Review><Response>None<//Response><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

<Name>Jason Lum< /Name><time>1458230093112< /time><rate>3<//rate><review>BBQ Chicken is Korean food? What? The name always throws me off. Especially, if you are looking for some Southern Food. This is a different kind of Seoul Food.

I was a bit skeptical at first, because the idea of Olive fried chicken is about as appealing as a Diet Coke. I always cook with Olive oil, but I hate to break it to you (health nuts) but deep frying in Olive Oil is the same as any oil. If you use gallons of oil, there's no health benefit over vegetable or canola. Also, vegetable oil has a high smoking point making it ideal for frying, but Olive oil will taste like burnt candles if heated over a certain temperature. I promise I will not bore you with anymore food science. If you are trying to stay health by eating Olive Oil fried chicken, go somewhere else and peel the skin off or dab your pizza, because this place like a diet soda IS NOT HEALTHIER. Also, be prepared to pay a butt-load for Fried Chicken which is normally a relatively cheap food.

To be honest with you the food at BBQ Chicken real isn't that bad. Every time I go the restaurant is packed and has a decent atmosphere. I never really had much trouble with service. The servers try to be extra friendly, but I have heard complaints about servers that don't give much service to women. That's understandable haha jk. Sometimes women tend to get jealous of other women...

However, for the price and the value. The chicken Meh! A whole chicken cost about 20 dollars roughly after tax for about 8 pieces. It is not finger licking good. I hate to copy another review..but go to KFC instead. Personally, after eating I felt like driving the 15 or 20 miles to go Popeye's instead. $20 probably would get a nice 20 piece bucket of spicy Louisiana style friend chicken.

If money is not an issue and you are looking for Korean food with a twist, give it a try. If you are looking for Fried Chicken, go elsewhere. Sometimes Korean Mixes are good like Amerie, very hot! However, BBQ Chicken is not recommend for hardcore Fried Chicken lovers.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcde9d7036af77:0xcf173dd87df8d562< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) This store is too bad. In particular, the attitude of the owner and his staff is very rude.
In short, the attitude of the employee (John) or the boss is too rude. When an employee speaks in Korean and suddenly speaks in English and suddenly says to hang up, do you not hang up first? After talking to the boss, it seems that the employee training is not good. I was wondering how to hang up the phone while I was talking to the customer, and my son didn't listen to me, but the employee asked me if he would listen. I tried to talk about the attitude of the employee and I became a strange person. This store doesn't seem to have the common sense of dealing with customers.

한마디로 직원(John)이나 사장의 태도가 너무 무례하다. 직원이 한국말로 통화하다가 갑자기 영어로 말하면서 전화를 끊겠다고 하면서 먼저 전화를 끊어버리지를 않나, 다른 직원한테 매니저나 사장한테 전화해달라고 매세지를 남겨달랬으나 영업종료시간까지 전화도 안주고, 내가 다시전화해 사장과 통화를 해서 사장한테 직원교육이 잘 못된거 같다, 손님과 통화중에 전화를 끊는 법이 어딨냐했더니 자기 아들도 말 안듣는데 직원이 말을 듣겠냐며 사장 역시 통화 도중에 전화를 끊겠다고 말을 했다. 직원의 태도에 대해 말하려고 했던 내가 이상한 사람이 돼버렸다. 이 가게는 손님을 대하는 상식이 통하지 않는 것 같다.</text>

<text>Super fast delivery, great tasting e-juice, pleasure to do business with. Also really like that the 120ml bottles of Funky monkey come in glass containers taste is so much better. Highly recommend you try it you’ll love it. Cheers.</text><user_name>Yura Dneprov<//user_name><GmapID>0x808fe6293eaa8e09:0x4589517533fb0831< /GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

<user>115169526309344948265< /user><review>Apollo has been the most consistent, and customer friendly, vape website, on the market. I was disappointed to learn that they no longer produce my juice in a 120ml glass bottle as of last month(which now means I have to purchase 2 60ml plastic bottles at a higher price). But, as of my most recent purchase, I'll add health conscious to that list of pros as well. At no additional cost, Apollo included 10 face masks for me during the peak of this pandemic. Can't praise them enough for that. If I had any one complaint, it would be the no free shipping in comparison to some other sites out of California. But they won't lose a star from me.
5 star quality.</review>< rate>

< review>
I have tried about every e-cigar there is and Apollo, in my opinion, has them all beat. I prefer using the disposable cigars and the taste of an Apollo is the closest to a real cigar that I've found and they last as long or longer than any other brand. Combine that with stellar service and unbeatable prices and you too will be a loyal customer.<//review>

<Text>Apollo Lounge is a bit hidden but definitely worth the search. The shop is welcoming with very friendly staff. They know what they are talking about and are quick to help you find what you need. When it comes to juice they have a wide selection and are able to find a juice that fits your taste. Looking for a new mod or atty? They carry a fine selection of both! Whether you're trying to find your zen or looking to play some pool this place has it all!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The Apollo lounge has alot of space and a very cool vibe. If you like to trick it's a good place to practice. There's  a good variety of juices, and a good selection of mods and atomizer. The employees are really cool too.</Review>

<Review>First time, will not be back. Love a&w food, unfortunately they can't find good employees. Ordered a burger that was cold! I am not saying not hot, it was cold to the touch, like freezing. They have me my money but no apology at all, just excuses. These restaurants in this area are not being managed and someone is burning money for nothing</Review>< pics>

Order my food through curbside pick-up and took so long to get to me. They brought the food to my car without my drink. I called and told them we were parked out front eating and they said they would not bring out my drink and that I would have to go through the drive thru.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Pulled into drive thru. Was told they would be right with me. 2 1/2 minutes later my order was taken. I drove up to the window to pay. 1 1/2 minutes later someone takes my money. Told to wait in front. 15 minutes later my food arrives. Not how I asked for it. I told them 15 minutes is to long. I got a in sincere I'm sorry. Not the first time at this location. Spent my last dollar there.</Review><time>1530243328869<//time>< name>

This place is usually good. But today. Omg. It was horrible service. The manager was talking to his wife or girlfriend. An she was getting free food. Although actual paying customers were waiting.it took almost an hour to get 3 meals. Plus I ordered inside so I got my own drinks.  The employees were joking around and cussing like sailors in the back. The manager was allowing his wife or girlfriend and her friend stand at the counter and yell to people behind the counter saying unprofessional things as the employees responded. Plus the  baby was crawling all over the counter where food is placed. It was just ridiculous. . Corporate should be embarassed to even own this place. I left. 🔥< /Text>

Idiotic? Ordered the freeze (blended float) and was then asked if I wanted a freeze OR a float........My grandmother orders the A1 JUST the sandwich, he repeats the order after and said the fries will be a minute...We didn't even order fries.... Apparently it was hurting his brain too much that it made our sandwiches cold. Inconsiterate children.</review>

Awful service, the drink portions are tiny compared to other chains, and the KFC food I got from there had two BONES in it. Never ever go there.< /text>

This place is great. Love the fish tacos. Love the taquitos. The torta is so good. The chile relleno is wonderful. But this place has been temporarily closed for awhile.  When are you guys opening back up?</Text>

I had we a hard time justifying a $2 and change tako when the food served on the smaller side of things.  The over taste was ok nothing sub par. But for the price it should reflect</Text>

Young lady in front counter handling cash and food with out washing hands.  Carne asada looks like ground beef.  No flavor.

Young lady is extremely rude and has bad attitude.    Needless to say I did not even eat the food because I lost my appetite looking at the food.     Gave no fork or spoon to eat. Not even napkins.

Do not recommend for anyone to buy food from this establishment</review>

These guys do some of the best tacos/burritos/tortas around.  They have several locations in East LA but I had no idea they had opened a spot this far east,  I am glad they did, tho.< /Review>

I guess it depends what you order but I ordered the carne asada fries and it was drowned with all the ingredients and very little meat. The green salsa has no flavor. The food was not good. Won't return.<//Text>

I came here because they said they close at 7 I got here at 6:30. I was going to order one food item and 4 fresh squeezed juices. They told me they couldn’t make anything I ordered because they where getting ready to close And had already cleaned out there equipment. I get people want to leave early but you close at 7 not 6:30 very unprofessional I suggest you call before you go so you don’t waste your time. I hope the owner of this establishment knows it’s workers are turning people away because they want to leave early.</Text>

I came to the store and asked if they're oatmeal had honey in it and told them I'm allergic to honey. They said they're oatmeal does not have honey in it so I ordered some.

I don’t know if it was just when I was there, but the employees spent more time talking to one another and making drinks for their friends than helping customers. I had my baby with me, and had to wait at least 20 minutes for my drink to be made, not counting the time I waited for them to come to the counter to take my order. There were also first responders waiting on their drinks as well.< /Review>

Six times my daughter has asked for bubble tea. Six times I’ve gone to Quickly during their posted business hours. Six times they’ve been closed. They literally never open on time. This is no way to run a business. I give up.< /Review>

They  are always very rude to me when I go there. they always seem to have an attitude for no reason they can’t even recommend any type of drink for new customers. She doesn’t seem to understand English when I had asked her what drink was most popular. .  I do not enjoy going in there I wish they had a better attitude towards their customers.< /text>

<Time>1584732084698<//Time><UserId.>117592750794235082945</UserId.><Review>So many things to love about this venue! I love how expansive the space is, so you don't feel claustrophobic if you have a large wedding guest list. There are multiple different options for where to hold the ceremony and reception, depending on the look and vibe you are going for. As a photographer, the light is so perfect at multiple parts of the day (which is rare!).</Review>< gmapID>

Nice relaxing atmosphere to taste some wines. Junior took the time to explain each wine to us.  We were not rushed even though it was close to closing time. Our favorite was the zinfandel.< /review>

<Text>We love this winery. The employees are very courteous. We have been tasting at Trentadue for over a year now and never have experienced the pretentious vibe that we have felt at other wineries in the past. The prices are VERY reasonable and the quality is quite good. They have a very nice area for outdoors tastings making us very comfortable in spite of the pandemic.< /Text><username>Eric Pierce<//username>< gmap_id>

The wine here is great—I especially liked the chardonnay. But this review is more for the other services. I went to a wedding here this weekend, and the staff were awesome: polite, friendly, very attentive, and went out of their way to get everyone what they needed. And the food was phenomenal. One of the best meals I've ever had at a wedding. I wish more of my friends would get married here!<//review>

<Text>Excellent Prosecco and Port. Beautiful and relaxing grounds to chill and have a picnic. Customer service is not consistent...one day awesome...one day not so much...employees in tasting room need to be more passionate and friendly with their greeting of people and service...sucks to say that...but true...sometimes very disappointing as could be great every visit! Salute!</Text></record>

One of the Most beautiful winery's of all Sonoma County.  The most elegant Port I have ever tasted.  Chocolate Amore.  I have given this port to very very special people.  They are in awe when I give it to them and begin to tell them all about Trentadue.  Love there wines and the most beautiful place to have your wedding.  Enjoy!!!!!!<//review>

< Review>
The chocolate port at this tasting room is as one-of-a-kind as the friendly, helpful staff within and the beautiful, scenic grounds all around.< /Review>

Awful, winery absolutely never going there again. My friend (former tasting manager) highly recommended it so we went. Apparently this winery is hurting for money as their tasting room manager and staff keep track of every wine glass they give with each tasting and charge you it if it's not returned after you leave the winery. You get no warning nor does it say anywhere if you take the glass that they will charge you for it so you don't know they do it unless you check your transactions. A wedding party was having their rehearsal was finishing up while we were there and once they left one of the staff complained to the tasting manager that they took 6 glasses and his response was "don't worry we'll charge the bride for them." Mind you this couple is spending thousands of dollars at their winery and they're going to charge the bride unknownly for all those glasses. Not cool and distasteful on their part and wonder if that's even legal to charge you after you leave especially when they no longer have your credit card? The tasting manager (the only one pouring) also took a long phone call while we were there which was rude and he completely forgot about us once another couple came in that was a lot younger (there were only 4 customers total doing the tasting). My girlfriend felt bad and embarrassed for bringing me there as this was the worst experience we've ever had at a winery.<//Text>

Slash is such a lovely and convenient car wash. There was an attendant at the money machine who helped me select my wash and sprayed down the front of my car. Then there were two more attendants who scrubbed my back and front windows. The whole cycle through the wash was maybe two mins and it was surprisingly efficient. My car came out sparkling and my daughter found it very entertaining. Win/win!</review>

<review>In general is a good car wash, I go there often. It offers different levels of washes, from basic to ultimate. I would say in general dona good job cleaning the car. Maybe it could spend a bit more on the drying part as cars normally don't get very dry out.
They have people prewashing the car before it enters to the tunnel, which is a nice touch, and there is another person after you can ask for finishing off the car. Finally, they have complimentary vacuuming. Overall a good place to wash the car, maybe just a bit on the expensive side.<//review></record>

Worth every penny. If you have the means to have your car washed, this is the best value I've found.

Pleasant and helpful staff, and vacuums that work very well. Able to pull dog hair out of the carpet without much issue.

I call it as I see it, give it a try.< /text>

It gets your car cleaner no doubt but I always leave with dirt still on my car and soap on the windows and wheels. If you need a quick wash with free vacuums its ok.</text>

<text>They said it's okay to let my car with a cycling roof rack to go through their car wash and it ripped it off causing dents in my cars roof... They tried saying it was loose or broken and would give me a free car wash instead of paying for repairs. I use the rack all the time, perfectly installed, it caused damage to my car because in was installed properly on top. Gonna have to take alternative measures. Don't pay them to go through their wash without a rack, they don't care about damaging your vehicle, they just want your money. They also have children working all over that place.<//text><user>109882803175494836657</user>< Gmap_id>

There were suds still on my vehicle when I pulled into a vacuum spot. (Strike 1.) The first employee did a lousy, uninspired wipe down of the suds. I asked her to do a couple of more spots, which again I witnessed a very lackadaisical response. I then received a smallish towel from her relief. By that time I decided I would do it myself. (Strike 2.) Lastly, the passenger side vacuum hose did not have a nozzle on it. How am I supposed to vacuum the tight grooves? (Strike 3!)< /review>

<Review>The employees at Splash have always been helpful! Sometimes it's a little busy but it's always been a great spot to go and get your car wash. I also like the fact that Splash has another location off of College Avenue now...very close to where I live and in my opinion the perfect location compared to the one off of Santa Rosa Avenue.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I have the monthly subscription which is a great deal. 30 bucks and you can wash your car as many times as you want. They recycle their water and have a state of the art wash that ensures every car comes out clean. Most washes I have been through never get my truck clean, but this one has brushes that reach every part of my vehicle and it comes out spotless. Would definitely recommend Splash Express.<//review>

Love this place! FREE access to vacuums with purchase of any wash. And once a month 101.7 offers free basic wash for anyone with a 101.7 sticker on their car! First Wednesday of every month  11-1 pm ¡warning! it is packed during these times but flows pretty fast</Review>

Saves me a lot of time, energy, and money along with getting a nice looking ride! Plenty of vacuum stations and they work well...

The staff has always been courteous with good customer service. Well worth the price to help make my life easier!</Text>< pics>

This place is the best! Best quality mechanized wash I've used, also the subscription deal is amazing. 30 bucks a month and you get unlimited washes at either of the locations if you like to keep your car clean it's literally a no-brainer everyone there does a really good job and make sure not to mess up your car!</text>

Great place to have your car washed, drive through. Pull up and a young man will come out and help you choose a wash for your vehicle then you drive around the corner and you are guided to the wash put in neutral  and you can make phone calls or write a check then you are through, clean as a whistle!</Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>The quickness of going through is convenient but the carwash lacks the ability to remove all of the dirt. It also isn't a touch less wash which will cause swirl marks over time and issues with clear coat. The dryer at the end also doesn't dry your car all the way. The vacuum system, while powerful, takes about 5 minutes to get a spot.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I like this car wash place. They allow you to vacuum your own car after the wash which ensures the job will be done according to your level of motivation. Don't come there if you're feeling lazy.< /Review>

I really love this place. They have reasonable prices and after selecting and paying for a wash they give you unlimited time to use the vacuums. The only thing I wish Is that they sold more car detailing products (dash wipes, air freshener, etc.) but aside from that the service is fast friendly and very efficient.</text>

<Review>Horrible customer service.  Every time I go I have to buy a towel, ot is not a choice in the packages to  include it for additional price. And  they don't even provide water for free  to clean inside your car. it's all  about the cents and how much money for the less effort  they can get from you.  Manager Chris it's not a proactive,  resourceful person, he really doesn't care about losing customers.. or feed ba k and ideas to improve...last time I go! for one more dollar do you get full service and better attitude. Don't waste your time.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x8084481c11488b81:0x6b8663f8ed7a2f58< /GmapID></record>

Good, reSĺnably priced drive through car wash with different levels of added features. Their package deal are a bargain and they offer free self serve vacuums too. Unlike most car wash in this price range they actually have people prepping your car before the machines take over.< /Review>

The "better wash" is reasonably priced and gets the job done. Free vacuuming is available, which gives you the tool you need to clean the interior of your car as well. Floor mat grippers are a plus, so you can hang your car mats and easy clean them!</text>

<text>Decent, but not great. I paid almost as much as I do for a hand car wash, but the machine isn't strong enough to scrub off the bugs from the grill, so i had to do that by hand. I also had to vacuum by hand and couldn't wipe the inside of the windows like they would at a hand wash. Paid extra for the tire wipe, but had to go in and remind them to come out to do it. Better value is probably still the hand wash.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Car Wash specials! They did an excellent job and have free vacuuming! The only downside is they are very busy and wait times to vacuum after you wash are sometimes long.  On the plus side they are building a new car wash on College that will be open in the spring of 2018! Yay!< /Review>< user>

The car wash is as good as most automatic washes and thankfully they reclaim their water. Additionally, if you buy the highest level wash they will re wash it within 72 hours at no cost. The one piece of their business that rubbed me wrong was that they advertise that if it rains within 72 hours of your wash they will also re wash it. The problem is that you have to have it re washed within the 72 hours even if it is still raining. To me this means their push to have you get it washed even if it might rain soon is very misleading and now I know not to trust that.<//review>

Car nice and clean. Did not know you have to wipe your car dry. the blower removes most of the water. I just drove off and air dried and car still looked shiny and clean.</Review>

By far the best drive-thru car wash in the area. Little to no wait times, my sedan looks like new as soon as it rolls past the air dryers, and to top it all off, the vacuums are easily accessible and will have the interior looking awesome!!!< /text>

It's pretty good. Not my favorite car wash but I like how they have vacuums to use as well. That's why I come here, it's a one stop shop to clean your car.</Text>

Nice wash and vacuums. However, it'd be nice to have the car hand-dried at the end, as the automatic dryer doesn't really finish the job.</Text>

Great car wash for an every once in a while job, the downside as a professional detailer is the fact that the wash tunnel over time will cause micro scratches to your paint surface, which I I guess is good for my business and polishing to repair them, but bad for the customers that have to pay high dollar for the paint correction. I wouldn't use this as my main source of washing my vehicle, touchless is by far the way to go if it is available.</Text>

< review>
The price of the carwash isn't too bad $6.95 I paid. But the car wash itself was fairly poor. It didn't do the rims very well and the people who sprayed the pre-wash on didn't really get the whole car so as a result it wasn't very clean when I came out and the air dryer didn't dry the car off very well. On the plus side, the vacume area was nice. Hoses on both sides of your car. Nice long hose length. Detail attachments on the ends. Floormat clip boards for hanging your floormats. Trash cans on both sides. And untimed self vacume ability was included in the price of the carwash. The place was tidy. Garbage cans kept emptied. I found it a bit cramped to drive around at in a larger vehicle but managable.
Its certianly much nicer looking with its modern glass walls letting you view the cars go thru the wash and better equipped vacume wise than the self serve carwash down the block. But if you dont mind doing it yourself and like a little elbow room and a wash that gets off the heavy grime and dont need the entertainment of seeing how a drivethru carwash works then skip going to Splash. It's basicly only good for a quicky exterior wash job and a really good vacume.
But for the price just the untimed vacume is worth going there thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.</review>

Best drive through carwash around Sonoma County. The lines can get pretty long at certain times during the day. Best to look at the "popular times" since they can be pretty accurate. I've never noticed a scratch on my car afterwards, which is a good thing! They also have free vacuums, powerful ones too. They have different services/prices for your specific needs.<//Review>

It took 7-minutes to entrance of wash, total time for car wash 20-minutes. Need to improve process. Too much water left on a car, air blower may not working well?</text>

I use this car wash quite a bit..And the only complaint i have is as long as i've used them the to people that spray and brush your car off before it goes through the system won't put any effort into it..generally it only gets half done, and it shows in the finale results</Text>
