<Time>1619293659132</Time><rate>5<//rate><Review>Roman and his crew are amazing!!! One of a kind. Contacting and scheduling an in-person estimate was prompt and easy. Roman showed up on time for the appointment, looked at the project and gave me an estimate right away. He was realistic and fair with his estimate. OC Tree Services do not mess around with your time and theirs. They started the following week at 7:00 am and continued to be punctual throughout the project. Roman and his crew demonstrated to be very professional, knowledgeable, respectful and committed. Also, they were responsive to my needs. They made the extra effort to do an outstanding job with no supervision from me. They removed 22 very large trees, 9 palm trees, 6 Italian Cypress pines and did a lot of tree and shrub trimming. Clean up was great, including removal of the cuttings that fell into the pool. I am very happy with OC Tree Services and I will hire them again. OC Tree Services you rock!!!< /Review>< pictures>

They arrived with sufficient equipment and workers to do a complete job. Before hand we were kept current on the planned date and time of arrival. All was done efficiently and they were thorough in removing all debris. The price quoted was reasonable and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to have their trees trimmed or removed.  They are excellent!< /Text>

Mr Ramon merandi did the above works and I have never seen  with his attitude and sincerity in my life by the way I am over 80 years old and i I am disable American veteran who served  Vietnam and desert storm and  if you don’t higher  Roman to  do your job you are missing the greatest worker with very old philosophy that  his intention is only to please you and not cheating the amount of work  actually he did more Thant what I told him and it unheard and rare to find these kind people and it was greAtest pleasures of my life to have him to work in my garden it was unbelievable for me to observe his perfect job performance and no money could compensate for such a great job and great gentleman and wish him the best in his life and god bless Roman and his family    With all of my affection

I've used others, but Roman and his crew do a much better job. Our trees are always pruned to look natural and grow in well for the upcoming season. The clean up is fast and efficient (not easy with the pool) and they are the first service that has ever recommend fertilizer after pruning. Highly recommend!!!< /review>

I googled tree trimming service cost near me. A bunch of companies popped up under the google placement top 20 list. From the list I called Three of the companies which had the most customer reviews and highest ratings and left messages for all three on Tuesday 7.21.2020. Ramon from Orange County Tree Services called me back within 20 minutes. He let me know he can swing by my place in 20 minutes and get me a quote in person. We agreed on a price on the spot and scheduled a time for Thursday (Today) 7.23.2020. As far as my review, Ramon and his crew did an amazing job, showed up on time and left my place spotless. I will upload the before and after photos. Very satisfied customer and funny enough Ramon and his crew finished the job already and I'm still awaiting call backs from the other Two companies</Text>

Roman and his team have the most amazing work ethics They were so courteous, thoughtful,  well and did such a fabulous job of removing and trimming our trees, and brush,And they cleaned the  street, as  well.
Theyeven covered our new neighbors Koi pond to protect the fish that we didn’t know existed.
We wish we knew all their names and could thank them individually for their thoughtfulness, and excellent work.
we recommend Orange county tree service very highly to all that require  this type of work and hope to Have them back, for other projects as well.

OC Tree Services did a great job with the Olive Tree trimming last month. I had used this service last year for the same job and was quite happy with the work. Required social distancing and mask were observed by the crew. Roman works with your schedule and prices very reasonably. Highly recommend Roman and team for a professional tree service.<//Review>

They removed two large Liquid Amber trees for me in one day and came back a second day to grind the stumps and roots.
I was impressed with the professionalism and training of the crew that showed up.
I will use them in the future.< /Review>

They are professional, they know what they are doing, and they make sure that your yard is clean as it should be when they left.

I found Roman through Google and he had really good reviews. I gave him a call and he came out that same day to give me an estimate. I was going to hold off on getting tree service because I just moved into my home and had other priorities but my internet provider needed a tree trimmed before they could install the necessary cables to hook the system up. Roman was really nice and knowledgeable. He quoted me for that one tree and for rest of the house. I thought I'd ask since he was already here. He gave me a quote that I couldn't refuse so I decided to do the entire house. He even came out quicker because a cancelation he had. My wife had changed her mind last minute on a palm tree that we were originally going to cut down and Roman had no problem with it and even suggested trimming it. Im glad that he did because the aftermath was awesome. Roman and his team were clean, professional, and proficient. I would highly recommend him to anyone I know and who ever is looking for tree service. Thanks Roman and team!</Text>

<Text>I would think that by simply highlighting the five comments above that would be enough… But I guess I still I have a bit more to say…
Roman and his guys are the epitome of what a “crew” of workman should be.They get there on time, do a great job, have excellent job site manners and when they’re done, it’s obvious they’ve gone the extra mile to turn out the highest quality job possible !
Kudos and thanks to them all👍👏👏👏👏

The company responded very quickly to my initial Yelp request and came out very promptly to provide a free estimate.  The price was very good, the crew was very friendly and prompt and left the yard extremely clean!  They appear very knowledgeable about the healthy way to prune trees.  I will hire them again.</Text>

Roman and his team did an absolutely top-notch job trimming and cleaning our extremely large and tall trees: 2 Liquidambars (Liquidambar styraciflua), 1 Giant Phoenix Date Palm with the dangerous spines (Phoenix genus Canariensis), 8 Eugenias (Eugenia spp), 1 Jacaranda, 5 Palms, 2 Mediterranean Fan Palms clusters (Chamaerops humilis), and 2 clusters of the Giant Birds of Paradise.  They were professional, efficient, and cleaned the garden after very well.  Their prices are the best, service is exceptional, responsiveness, and diligence is HIGHLY COMMENDABLE.  Roman came out to give a quote on Wed and the job was done Sat same week!  Needless to say, we are very happy with their excellent work. My husband and I wish Roman and his crew great success and we highly recommend Roman's OC Tree Services for your tree job.</text>

Roman and his team just finished a 2 day job that included removal of a 40 year old California Pepper tree and pruning another 15 or so trees.

The price was competitive and fair, he was timely and left the job site looking great.

Was also very impressed with the attention to safety when difficult cuts were made!

Thanks Roman!< /text>

I highly recommend Roman and his crew for your tree trimming services. I called him on Monday, he returned my call an hour later. Came over the same day and gave me a fair estimate. Four days later Roman and his crew arrived on time. Very professional, knowledgeable and patient with my special requests. I was very happy with both Roman and Emil a member of his team. You can also read their reviews on Yelp.< /review>

<text>Great company! Found them online and they were able to come give me an estimate the same day I called. Needed a Saturday for service and they were able to accommodate. Price was fair and service and work was exceptional. Took a lot of height off one of my trees and trimmed and shaped two others. Easy to work with and left my back yard cleaner than it was before they arrived as well. Will definitely use for all my tree maintenance needs in the future.</text>< Resp>

Roman and his group were very professional.  Everyone knew what to do and did it quickly.  Their equipment was top-notch, from their pristine gear, industrial sized truck and chipper to their Stihl chain saws.  And they cleaned up like they were never here.  Highly recommended.</Review>

I have used OC tree services on 2 occasions and they were fantastic! Not only were they competitive, but they approached a difficult job with quality and care to our home and our surrounding neighbors. This involved trimming of tall palm trees. I look forward to working with them again.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>O.C. Tree Services is the best tree company I’ve ever dealt with. We live up in Silverado Canyon so we have had to have our tress trimmed or removed quite a bit over the years. They are so reasonably priced and really know their business. We have used them a couple of times now and they have always been on time, respectful of our neighbors and do beautiful work. When they leave there is no clean up to be done because they do it all.< /review>< Rate>

Returned my call right away and came the same day to give me a quote.
He was considerate to text me to tell me when he was on his way and his ETA.
His price was more than we have paid in the past but the lady we have used for about 15 years is no longer in the area.
I was not home until they were done trimming my orange tree, but they did a very nice job cleaning up and returning items to their place (bird feeders, potted plants) and even carefully removed twinkle lights I had forgotten were in the tree.
I am very pleased with how they trimmed the tree leaving branches in the right place so it will fill in and blossom nicely in a few weeks.
I would reccomend them to anyone who asks and plan to contact them again next year.< /review>

At 11:00 PM, the night before 4th of July, a branch broke off the tree in front of our house and landed on my car. The next morning, being 4th of July, I called around trying to get someone out to remove this big branch from my car but of course no one was available.   Finally I reached Roman, and he came out and took care of everything.  He was quick and professional.  I highly recommend him.  We could barely get out of our front door because this branch was also blocking the door...thanks to Roman, he came out and handled everything.  We were ready for our guests that were coming over later to celebrate the 4th.<//review><date>1562274703947</date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Romantic and his crew removed two tall palms under utility wires and trimmed a big tree for a competitive price.  They did an excellent job and they did a complete cleanup. I would highly recommend them.< /review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I'll start by saying we have almost 20 various fruit trees around our home. We requested a quote on Wednesday to have 2 50+ year old trees trimmed. Roman cam out within a couple hours and quoted us a very reasonable price, and then spoke with us about all our other fruit trees, and how he cares for his own fruit trees at home. They were able to schedule our service for the next day and texted later that they could start a few hours eariler if we were okay with that. The crew worked safely and efficiently. They cleaned up our yard better than it was before the service. Our trees were trimmed better than we had anticipated and look absolutely beautiful. We will be using this company for  our tree care needs going forward. I can not recommend Roman and his crew highly enough.

We have used many tree services in the past, and this was the first crew who trimmed everything perfectly.

We requested quotes from about a dozen companies for this job and Roman was priced in the bottom half. The work they performed is worth double what he charged.

You will not be disappointed using OC tree service< /Review><time>1561049021505<//time>< name>

He came and gave the quote on Friday. We agreed on the price and time. He was on time today (Monday). Removed the tree , fixed all the sprinklers and replanted some trees as agreed. Cleaned the place and left. Very professional and quick. Hence 5 starts. No mess left behind as well.< /Review>

The entire process was easy and the install went very smoothly. Jeremy and Gonzalo were here to do the install of our security gate. They were friendly, informative, patient and thorough. Gate looks great! Thank you! I would highly recommend this company!<//text>

The company made a proposal for us and understood we were outside of their service area. They agreed to fabricate the gates but would not be able to install the gates. We agreed to that condition. Then the company ignored us and told us they would not want to service our area. The company told us they also raised their prices but you would be honored with the $95 since they are now charging $115 sq feet for installation now. We spent time on the phone with this company to make our gates customized to what they offered and in the end it didn't work out since they are 8 weeks behind on fabrication (they stated this) and prefer to make more money on newer projects with higher prices. The employee, Daniel, also laughed at us on the phone call knowing full well what kind of position he put us in and had nothing more to add besides "If you want to speak to a supervisor, you can, but that won't change what the CEO stated."

Good luck to you Mulholland Brand! We will choose someone else!< /Review>< UserId.>

After searching for years to find the right company to replace our condo building's aging entry gates and fences, we met with Mulholland Gates - and the search was over. The level of detail that goes into the entire process from start to finish is extraordinary. High quality product and meticulous measurements and installation, these are true artisans.  Everyone we worked with on planning  - Avi, Yossi, Eyal, Ran - to the amazing installation crew led by Harout  - Jeremy, Norman, TJ, Corey, Marc, and Josh - was a skilled professional.  On time arrival and completed an insane amount of work in just one day. The gates are a work of art, we are very happy with the end result.  Heidi W - Homeowner</review>

I purchased a new gate system over a year ago. After a slow start to get the company to come back and fix some glitches in the system I finally talked to Ryan who took my issue and ran to get me parts under warranty and made it happen.  He sent me Norman who was very knowledgeable and quickly fixed all. Ryan and Norman Got me to give this 10 out of 10 review.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>While I did not use this business to purchase a front entry gate I am writing this review to share the excellent customer service that I received from them.  I was paired up with Liz and from the moment I sent an email, Liz responded.  She was knowledgeable about their products, flexible, and priced right.  I also liked their product offerings very much and they were even open to some customizing.  Liz worked very hard to try to make the situation work for me but unfortunately we could not move forward.  The problem that we ran into was location.  We live in Palm Springs and they are in Los Angeles.  We would have had to piece meal the project with 3 different contractors: manufacturer, shipper, and then installer. The dynamics were too risky, therefore, we had to look locally for someone who could manufacture, deliver, and install.  If not for the logistical issues I would have worked with Mulholland Brands in a heartbeat.  Liz, thank you so much for all of your assistance.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2bdf121f90841:0x7df5d02611247f30<//gmapID></record>

I called this company to get an estimate on fencing. The customer service agent said he had no one to come out and if I would measure and take photos he could give me an estimate. Frankly, that is not my job to do your work. I will go elsewhere.<//text>

We found this company in one of the home magazines that was delivered to our home. Really liked the idea of aluminum gates as the iron ones we previously had were rusted. We had a little bit of a challenge on the sales side at first as the sales rep we were working with left the company, but ultimately were able to order the gates we had wanted.
The best part of the whole process was the installation. Robert, George, and Marco installed two games and two panels for us and did an excellent job with the quality and workmanship. We are very happy with the final install.<//Text>

Our home is in Hawaii, but when I saw the L.A. Mulholland Gates online, I fell in love with them.  We couldn't find gates like those in Hawaii!  Our driveway gate was tricky to measure, build and install because our home is on a slope.  We measured it, and the Mulholland team built and installed it.  Harout, Ran and the entire team were awesome!  The gates are beautiful, whisper quiet and functional.  I highly recommend Mulholland.< /Text>

My wife and I could not be more pleased with the process of dealing with Mulholland Security personnel from the initial inquiry all the way through to the final installation. My first point of contact was with Yael the sales manager. From start to finish in my dealings with her she was unfailingly polite and nice. She is the definition of an efficient professional who knows the product and is very honest describing it (without the usual sales B.S. I received from other companies). We wanted the gate to match our existing Wayne-Dalton garage door and Yael assured me they could match it, and they did. I was given status updates throughout the process (which isn't always the case for construction projects). Liz the scheduler, who wears multiple hats, stepped in seamlessly and very professionally to coordinate the overall process with me. Harout, the designer who also did the field measurements, was so positive and accommodating I knew I would be happy with the overall result. When Ron, the lead installer arrived with his assistant installer Robert, they also proved to be very thorough professionals. It was obvious from start-to-finish that they take pride in their work and making customers happy.  We are thrilled with the outcome and have been getting rave reviews from neighbors. We feel like we received a very high-quality product for a competitive price.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Let me start by saying that I am admittedly a stickler for detail and not the easiest to work with.

Our house had wooden gates on both sides that looked just okay and were barely functional.
I looked at iron gate options but knew that I would need to maintain those and that over time, I would have to deal with sagging issues.

I was referred to Mulholland by a contractor who told me they had a great aluminum product that cost a little more. I contacted them and I must say that I am grateful I went with them. The "little more" was only about 15% more than iron for a far superior product and actually a lot less than other aluminum gate competitors.

Our white aluminum gates look fantastic. Huge improvement on the facade of our home. They have the sturdy/safe metal feel without the overly heavy iron handling. The installation was done with attention to detail and the cleanup was thorough.

Their entire team is knowledgable and courteous. At different stages, I dealt with: Eyal, Ron, Gonzalo, Corey and Jubilee. All of them stand up people.

Well deserved 5 stars team. I would recommend you without reservation.

<Review>Excellent and responsive sales team who quickly set up a consultation. All of our questions were answered at the consultation.
The installation was prompt, well within the timeline provided by the company. The product is quality as was the installation. When we asked for small adjustments to the gate, even after paying, Mulholland was responsive and quick to resolve the issues. Will be recommending to friends and family.</Review>< time>

I had to call my painter to fix the wall with the cement, I just called Mulholland again the cement was never repaired on the stone, I'm now waiting for someone to come back to my home to fix.. One more item my contractor is here working on my kitchen remodel and informed me the gate is not leveled.,

I was unaware of the use of aluminum for gates and fences. When compared with wrought iron, aluminum has major advantages both from the aesthetic point of view and weight and designability. The aluminum gate design and constructed by the Mullholland Security Company is strong and beautiful, adding to the property value.

I found Mulholland Brand on Yelp and was impressed by the good reviews. I wasn’t sure what to expect, and as soon as Avi arrived to my house I felt that this is the company I’m going to hire for the job. Avi’s suggestions were on point, and together we designed the perfect security solutions for our home. In the next meeting I’ve met the team who measured and went through every detail of the project.  3 weeks later a different team arrived to install everything. I was amazed by the quality of the gates, fence, motor and keypads. I was blown away when everything was installed and I saw how our ideas became reality. We feel safer in our house and happy to know that we added tremendous value to the property. I would highly recommend them for any project size as they are meticulous about every detail as well as my satisfaction as a client!< /review>

When it came to the installation, the two installers were outstanding, Robert and Gonzalo, in making sure that the fit and finish was just as nice as my experience seeing the gate in the factory. They exhibited their pride in doing a terrific job and for that we thank you.
As you can tell we highly recommend Mulholland Security if you are looking for a high quality result!

<UserId.>107108778118423438032< /UserId.><review>Mulholland Security provided me with great service by installing new fencing and gates for my home last year. The staff and crew are very kind and extremely skilled. I love the fact that their specialties are fencing and gates  because they have a clear focus. The work they completed for me still looks amazing! I appreciate the strong, quality materials they installed. Thanks to Avi, the “surprise” wood that was used, feels and looks beautiful, special just for my home (definitely thick wood and great metal). The responsiveness of Ran, the project manager, was always consistent and very much appreciated. As I requested a few things during and after the project was completed, Ran was very personable and patient with me (even though I’m sure I got on his nerves).

The work they completed provides me with the necessary security without taking away the character of my house (it enhances it). Oftentimes, I receive compliments from neighbors and friends, which leads to referrals to Mulholland (I hope to post again soon regarding the work they will complete for the home of one of my friends).

I appreciate the professionalism Mulholland offered and the quick completion of the fencing and gates for my home. I would recommend their services to those who are interested in this type of work.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2bdf121f90841:0x7df5d02611247f30</gmapID>< Rating>

<Text>I can’t say enough good things about Avi and his team. In addition to being diligent about exceeding promises about quality and deadlines, they are impressively honest.

Too often since I moved to L.A. five years ago, I’ve been burned by a wide range of vendors promising services that aren’t delivered properly or within the guaranteed budget. With Avi, I had only one surprise, and it was a delightful one.

I was fortunate that Avi personally came to my home and took the measurements and walked me through various gate alternatives and solutions. He never pushed anything on me or tried steering me to the more expensive choices. Avi was also incredibly patient, as I don’t readily understand schematic diagrams and plans.

Avi has an awesome team behind him. As soon as I signed a contract I began hearing from Liz, his production manager, who explained all the steps going forward. Incredibly nice woman, and very responsive as well. My gates were ready weeks before the promised deadline.

The team that did my installation were rock stars: All of them went out of their way to make certain I was pleased with my installation and they spent considerable time testing my gate to make certain it was functioning properly. Sylvestor and Robert both are worthy of special mention. What especially impressed me about Avi’s team is that they clearly like working for the company.

Avi’s rigorous honesty must be noted. I noted in passing that someone who planted my hedges charged me $500 to install a conduit. Without missing a beat, Avi said, “Your contract included a charge for installing conduit. I will refund you the $500.” Avi could have kept quiet and I wouldn’t have known, but he chose to do right by me. That speaks to his character and the people he surrounds himself with.

Home security is now incredibly critical, and I imagine Mulholland will soon have more business than it can handle. If you can get them to do your installation, consider yourself very blessed. They are the best!</Text>< pics>

We purchased our gate for Mulholland security two years ago. Since installation that continue to provide excellent customer service to us. The gate itself is beautiful. We have received many compliments from our neighbors. Recently we had some issues with the functioning of the gate.   Liz from their customer service department was readily available to us. She made every attempt to get and stay in touch with us to price updates. As in the past they provided Swift, thorough, and helpful advice and service.   We would strongly recommend this company to anyone considering putting in Gates, security systems, or security lighting in their homes.< /review>

<text>My husband and I were more than happy with Mulholland Security Gates. The design, fabrication and installation exceeded our expectations. The gate design I wanted was a little different than what I had seen. I was unsure whether Avi understood exactly what I wanted. Well, he certainly delivered beautiful gates. Installation with Ran was also 5 Star. After laying the tract for the driveway, I asked them to bring it back further to the road....which meant an additional day and labor. Not a problem and no extra charge!
So yes, we highly recommend this well run and customer friendly company.</text><user_name>Pamela Stuppy<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I requested a technician to come to my residence and prepare an estimate for an electric gate. I have been in construction all my life and this is how I prepare an informative bid. Materials, Time, Labor. Regrettably, I had no such experience with the technician who showed up. I outlined very clearly what I wanted from every aspect of the installation requirements. He jotted down a sketched diagram and then told me what the price was if I ordered today. 65% higher than the next costly bid I have received. In addition when I asked him to prepare an estimate he said; "This is the price for today, take it or leave it. No estimate to be provided. I have witnessed first hand the various approaches vendor take to close a deal. Always an estimate. Without a written estimate there is absolutely no way to control cost overrides. You are at the mercy of the vendor. I politely suggested that this vendor take a hike<//text>

{'time': 1542405930981, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write a review.\n\nIn creating a proposal for our clients, who  initially get agreement  on an overall plan that is very general and non-binding. We give a price at that time as well. We then answer any and all questions.\n\nIf the client wants to go ahead with us, we write out a very specific contract. We are not aware of any rules or regulations that are being broken by operating in this manner.\n\nOur proposal  included drawings and an outline of all that was going to happen. We gave the price including a senior discount. Dominick\'s  project included a swing gate with a motor, safety for the gate, with a gooseneck and a keypad.\n\nDominick read our proposal , we answered his questions, and he decided not to go through with the negotiation.  The price was discussed and he said "no way"; it was completely out of his budget. We thought we had departed as friends with a nice firm hand shake only to find, later in the day, this review.\n\nThe sales representative does not recall his asking for a  written quote. We didn\'t see any reason to write out a formal quote (a very time-consuming activity, in that this was a custom project, with nothing "off the shelf") when he didn\'t see any way that he would be doing business with us.\n\nIn regards to our prices: our prices are frequently higher than many of our competitors. The reason for this is because we build from more expensive components, we build more intelligently, and we build to last.\n\nWe aren\'t a small time outfit that will only be around for a few years. We\'re not a couple fellows starting out, working out of a garage; we\'re a team of skilled people who make "A-Triple Plus" products that we and our clients are proud of and that last for years. Our clients generally don\'t complain about our prices as they know we give them back well beyond their expectations.  We\'ve been in business since 1994, and none of us are going anywhere! (We\'ve seen dozens of lower-priced competitors fail over the years.) Please, google "Mulholland Security Reviews" and read the hundreds of positive reviews.\n\nWe wish Dominick the very best, and trust that he was able to find an excellent gate from a competitor. We hope he will consider us in the future, should he ever need any help with this home security.'}<//resp>

Mulholland Security Center helped secure our home by adding both window and door locks.  Ran is super knowledgeable and always available if we need an extra hand to fine tune anything that might need to be handled. Not only has he assisted us in locks but created a new gate door to fix an existing one that was old an no longer working. We are so grateful for his help and the entire Mulholland team and look forward to using them for future projects we might have. I highly recommend their services to anyone and everyone! Thanks so much Mulholland and Ran!< /Text>

<text>Mulholland Security was amazing. When I moved into my home and looked for someone to install new locks they were the first ones to say we'll be right there.
They were so nice, sweet & friendly. But most importantly they were very professional and installed the best locks.
I also had them install a safe deposit box. Again they were very courteous and professional.
Another time I had to change the locks when I was going to move, so I called them and within the hour they sent someone to me.
If you are looking for reliable, professional, courteous and quick response time, I highly recommend Mulholland Security. They are the best.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Our child’s birthday party was the next Saturday. Ran showed up on Sunday to provide an estimate. Concrete was poured. Wood was cut. Finishes were painted on. A new motor was installed and finally the numbers were put back up. This was all done by Thursday! I can’t say enough good things about Mulholland. I didn’t believe it was possible but they did it! They alerted me as to the process and when workers would be there and made sure I was happy in the end. The workers were polite and helpful with things outside their scope. I was touched by their care and ability to follow through on the near impossible. I can’t say enough good things about every person I encountered on their team. I wish this were my experience with every contractor!<//text>< rate>

<review>I have been using Mulholland Security Gates for a number of years. They installed the most secure locks in my house, they were there when they say they will, they carefully cleaned before the left, I could not have requested anything more.  After several years, the hardware is still like new, I really like the quality of their material, it worth every penny that I paid at the time. I would recommend Mulholland Security to anyone who need locks, gates and security system, you always get the latest equipment at an honest price.</review>< rate>

We got excellent service through the creation and installation of our new gate. Attention was paid to all of our preferences  from choosing a different set of handles to adding different features to the gate. They came out as often as was necessary to make sure we were fully satisfied with the final product. We love our new gate as it is sturdy and very beautiful!   We highly recommend Mulholland based on our experience!<//text>

Mulholland Security is a great company, and their work is first class.  I have been using them for years and only have satisfaction to report.  We used to have all the fruit in our garden disappear as soon as it was ripening. Seriously it wasn't the critters but the cretins, they would wait till we were out and clean out all the trees.  Mulholland installed our security gates, and ever since we have lemons all year round and persimmons at Thanksgiving.  The gate still works flawlessly after ten years.

Thank you guys so much. If we could have 6 stars, I would have put it. I asked them to help me securing my commercial building and my house with some gates and door locks and the production was just unreal, not something you see a lot in LA. From the first phone call to completion things went just great with a lot of cheerfulness and effectiveness. Thank you guys.

completion these guys were on top of their game. Thank you very much Mulholland<//review>

While managing properties in the San Fernando Valley area I deal with several security/key companies. Mulholland security has been a great company to work with, we just finished a project in Studio City of re-keying an entire complex and they were very helpful in making sure, notices were posted with enough time and project was completed in a timely manner. Liz in the office is great to work with.</text>

I know the company and the owner for the last 10 years and all I can say is just good things about them and their contribution to the surrounding communities. They created a driveway gate for my Mom, installed security cameras and secured the doors with high security locks and every time we asked for their help they were pleasant and very professional. They really know their business. They also have lots of videos on you tube that can be very helpful which they will send you if you need to learn about any type of security hardware and their custom gates which my Mom and I used before we chose our gate design. Thank you Mulholland.<//Review>

What a great experience with Mulholland Security! From setting up appointments, to Yael's expertise and assistance in design and pricing, all the way through completing the project, Mulholland Security is a cut above. I was so pleased with their work on adding an electronic opener to a previously manual gate that I'm having them come back to do more.  Strongly recommend for professionalism, promptness and excellent work.</Text>

Avi and Ran came up with a creative way in which to re-utilize existing material to be secure, safe and frugal.  The work at both the driveway gate and garage was done promptly, professionally and with zero supervision by me which was a huge time saver.  I already recommended them to my realtor.  Thanks so much!!<//Text>

I used Ran and Mulholland for our apartment's 2 driveway gates and entry gate. On the first day of the job they showed with 6+ guy crew to get job done before the bad weather! Ran is a super-nice honest guy and is easy to get in touch with for any follow up problems or questions. I got 2 other cheaper estimates from other companies but I am glad I went with Mulholland. I would 100% recommend and use again in future.< /Text>

We can’t say enough good things about this company, and about their representative, Moshe, in particular! Moshe called within an hour after I submitted my online request (unlike many other companies, who didn’t even respond to my inquiry), and he went out of his way to set up a time to come see the gate site on a Sunday, when both my husband and I would be home so we could all discuss gate options together. Moshe was able to immediately come up with an amazing solution (a foldable, vertical opening gate!) to our awkward driveway conundrum, a problem that half a dozen other gate companies couldn’t solve. We hired Moshe and his team on the spot due to this answer to our problem, and because of Moshe’s trustworthy, communicative, straightforward and jovial personality. These guys are great, and will get your job done efficiently, kindly, and well, with great communication. Outstanding customer service - thank you. Can’t recommend them highly enough.<//text>

<Review>Avi  really helped me to refurbish my current gate and I was so happy! I really wanted to fix the bottom of my gate to keep my dog in the yard and now we are so happy to play with the kids outside and not worry about the dog's safety. Plus my gate looks brand new and I love it.  We also installed a new motor that works beautifully.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Mulholland Security did an amazing job electrifying doors for our business.  They were responsive, prompt and available over the weekend to do the install.  In addition, Ran made himself personally available and helped resolve an issue that had nothing to do with their work well after they've finished their work.

<review>Hands down the best gate and security company in LA County. Had several estimates for a motorized gate install and a pedestrian gate. No one was as competent or responsive as Avi. The work got started on time and was fast. Harout goes out of his way to make sure every detail is taken care of. They even followed up for a motor issue several months after install. What was quoted was what was paid, and the price reasonable for the quality of work. Also they have unique powder coated aluminum gates/doors/fences, that are unlike anything else that I was shown in other estimates. Very happy.<//review><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

<review>I want to commend your team for the service provided yesterday at my home in silver lake. My vehicle accidentally rolled into my gate, knocking it off track and bending the frame. Liz was able to dispatch a tech already in the field  and we got the driveway cleared and me on the way to work within an hour.  Then a team of two guys came out just after 5, busted out some welding lickety split, and by 6 they had applied chain grease and were done and we were on our way to our evening's event. This kind of service is why I'm glad to have worked with you on initial construction.<//review></record>

We used Mulholland Security for our condo’s security gates and they did a fantastic job. We are very happy with their work. Liz is the best! She coordinated the jobs and kept us informed as to how things will take to complete and walked us through the entire process. She was easy to work with and went above our expectations to make sure that we were happy with the services.
We highly recommend Liz Shamlian and the team at Mulholland Security!< /text>

Mulholland Security has provided me with a very beautiful custom gate that has worked beautifully for over 2 years with no maintenance issues at all. The owner has been great answering any questions I've had over the two years and I find him to be very responsive.</Text>

The problem was not due to them it was due to a shifting in the land.   Avi the owner takes such pride in his work & their craftsmanship is superior to anything else I’ve seen.

<user_id>114467254923631565963< /user_id><username>Mark Ciglar</username><Review>We contacted Mulhiolland Security to build a new fence, gate and intercom security system and are absolutely thrilled with the work they did.
Yael met with us twice to discuss options and provided us with great examples and lots of ideas. She was able to take our initial ideas and improve upon them while staying within our budget.
All of the work was done as promised and the quality exceeded our expectations. Each day the crew left the property spotless and were meticulous about their work.
The project manager, Dustin, was very communicative throughout the process and addressed all of our questions along the way. When there was one element that was different than we had expected, they changed it the next day to meet our request.
The quality of the finished fence and gate were so high that the contractor that is doing other work on our house commented on how impressed he was.
I couldn't recommend them highly enough. A+++< /Review><Date>1473187070922</Date></record>

Mulholland Lock and Security has been a great partner thoughout the years. Liz makes it easy to always touch bases with me on lead times and job information before their technicians come out to IMLSS to pick up. Customers, technicians and partners alike would all agree that she is one of Mulholland's best assets. Thank you for everything you do Liz!< /Review>

<Text>Mulholland just finished a small gate project for my Mother in Law.
The Project Manager Mosha was very professional. He was very understanding to my mother in law's needs, beeing an old woman living by herself,  and also gave great suggestions to improve the house's overall security. It felt like he realy cares for her safety .
The gate looks great and strong.
Much appreciated!< /Text>< pictures>

Mulholland is second to none, their customer service, pricing, quality and timing are all very important factors when choosing a company to complete any project and we are beyond blown away with each of these factors that Mulholland provided to us.  I also want to give a special shout out to Ran, he was on top of this job begining to end and made sure everything was done on budget and on time...well, he actually completed the install before the time that was quoted.

I like they have a website with different style gates to choose from, plus a youtube channel, where I can watch videos see the quality of their work.

Very responsive and personable, the work matched the quote they gave us, and they were punctual which was important to us since we had a lot going on during the holidays. Definitely would recommend Mulholland to others, esp if you need a company to secure public facing doors, thank you Yossi and Liz!< /text>

Let’s start at the bottom line: You are never going to find a more beautiful custom gate then with Mulholland Security Gates Los Angeles.  I have a modest home in the Valley and the gate designed and installed by Avi, Ran and the entire crew has turned my modest home into its own private gated community.

When you purchase a gate from Mulholland, you are not just purchasing security for your family, pets, etc.  But you are purchasing expertise and an entire crew of people that are dedicated to service and making sure your gate works perfectly.  For one gate, not only did Avi come to my house several times but I had a foreman, Ran, two contractors, and several workers on my project.  ALL of them were exceedingly nice, respectful and knowledgeable.

Not only did Mulholland provide me a beautiful gate but worked with me on the price and the terms of payment.  Now, do understand, Mulholland is not inexpensive.  But, as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for!  While you could potentially find a less expensive gate elsewhere you are not likely to find better VALUE.  And when it comes to the investment you make in your home and safety of your loved ones, I will make the tradeoff for value everyday of the week.

Further, Avi and his crew did provide several extras with the project that was much appreciated.  For instance, don’t forget when you install a gate, the mailman still needs to find a way to drop-off your mail (I have a house with the mailbox at the front door).  When this problem was discovered, Mulholland quickly went into action and actually installed a mailbox in the front of my house that looks quite charming.  All this is to say that Mulholland works with you to make sure that you receive excellent customer service.

Full disclosure, I just recently had the gate installed.  As with all installations, there are still some minor tweaks that need to be made (such as with synchronization/timing of the gate opening) but Avi and his crew are already on this issue and, if past is prologue, I am confident that it will be worked out soon and will be perfect!

In conclusion, if you want a beautiful custom gate, want folks that are dedicated to providing  you with value, and excellent customer service, you MUST give Avi and his crew at Mulholland Security Centers, Inc. a call.

Tomas

**Follow-Up**I just wanted to add a brief follow-up to my above review as a result of the continued excellent and impressive customer service I have received since my initial purchase from Mulholland Security Gates Los Angeles.  As with any large purchase of a significant mechanical item, such as a motorized custom gate, there will be a need for some minor follow-up and tweaks to perfect the operation of the gate.  Avi and his team have been friendly, professional and timely with all follow-up service with my beautiful custom gate.

Even more impressive has been Mulholland Security Gates commitment to customer service when a major weather storm and wind caused damage to the operation of my gate.  I received an immediate response from Avi and his team (on the weekend, no less) when I notified them of the damage and my beautiful custom gate is well on its way to being repaired.

In my initial review, I was pretty effusive with my praise because I was so happy and satisfied with the look and operation of my gate.  However, you never really know how a business will treat you after they have your money.  I can now say with full confidence, nearly 6 months after my purchase, that Mulholland Security Gates has been just as friendly, responsive, and professional as they were when they sold me the gate, as they are now when they service the gate.

If you are going to make the purchase and investment in your home of a beautiful custom gate, you might as well get that gate from the best and a company that will be there for you not just when you buy the gate but when you need them after.

Thanks again Avi, Ran, Harout and the whole team at Mulholland Security Gates Los Angeles!

Best,

<rating>1< /rating><Review>The work done by Mulholland Security Centers was determined by the California Contractors State License Board to be substandard. The project "does not meet accepted trade standards for goods and workman-like construction." After inspection by the Industry Expert from the California Contractors State License Board "the gate and pedestrian door do not line up correctly. The gate and door are not stable. The deadbolt lock does not latch properly. The steal post adjacent to the gate is loose and is easily moved." This is only the beginning of the problems Mulholland Security Centers aka Gates Los Angeles left behind.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1450281578979, 'text': 'A brief response.\n\nHere is our time track with “Dissatisfied H” ("DH" in the remainder of this reply.)\n\n1) We designed, built and installed a driveway gate and DH was pleased. DH  okayed a video showing her to be enthusiastic, and calling us “artists”.\n\n2) DH and I are neighbors. During the gate building, we became friends. Not romantically; we both had a strong interest in animals and support various animal charities. She often visited our home.\n\n3) We began other work for DH; installing security cameras.\n\n4) DH had some sort of personal upset with me. I have never determined what the cause of it was. She stopped calling me and seemed to be avoiding me. I emailed her and got a very rigid reply.\n\n5) The next day, she told us to stop installing the cameras. I tried to reach her, I called and emailed and dropped by. She was avoiding me.\n\n6) My employees tried to work with DH to resolve this unsuccessfully. She was angry in every communication and refused to answer our questions. We stopped the new work immediately and removed the security camera installation at expense to us, but at no cost to DH; sending her a check for her deposit.\n\n7) During this time, DH went to review sites and complained that our gate work was inferior and she had been cheated, and no one should work with us. These were lengthy and the first thing that you would view when visiting these sites.\n\n8)We came to her premises on many occasions (DH is in a poor cellular area. She does not have or will not tell us her landline number. So, we\'re unable to reach her on her phone and she does not return calls.)\n\n9) On two occasions we were allowed access to remedy her gate problems. She was unwilling to inspect the work at the end of the day, as our technicians left the job. She was willing to write emails the next day complaining again.\n\n11) With each attempt to resolve this we were met with increasing antagonism, and an unwillingness to allow us to enter the property and remedy.\n\n12) In the reviews she said she was contacting the Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) about the matter, without mentioning our attempts to resolve the issue.\n\n13) We have spent hours responding to these reviews and calling the various websites asking for their removal. Due to these sites\' policies, this is often not possible. On the occasions we were able to do this, once we got the review removed, we\'d find it reposted again with minor variation, under a different name.\n\n14)DH’s gate is heavy. Ask any gate contractor - they\'ll tell you that heavy gates need to be adjusted after installation, often several times. Our gates are warranteed for 2 years, so that they gate can be adjusted. If those adjustments are not made, the problems become bigger.\n\n15) When the CSLB did the inspection, they found what DH mentions here. These problems would not have existed if we were allowed access to DH’s property to do our adjustments. These problems aren\'t due to poor construction or a bad installation; they are the result of neglect.\n\n16) The CSLB listed the repair items. DH refused our request to repair them. At the CSLB\'s direction, we paid $4700 to DH so that she could hire another contractor.\n\n17) We have never had a situation like this. Google “Mulholland Security reviews” you\'ll see EVERYONE loves our work.\n\nBut, we were relieved that it was over, with the fast payment for the gate repair. Or so we thought!\n\n18) But, no! DH has,renewed her efforts to malign the company. She has new complaints on several review sites. We have called again to ask, “What can we do to make things right with you?” but, as before, she does not answer and her voicemail is not set up.\n\nI’ll write again and remain optimistic that this will resolve, someday; somehow.\n\nPlease, reader, take a few minutes to read our other reviews! They are wonderful and give a more real view of what our company is like and the quality of our work.'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Our homeowners association has been a client for several years beginning when Mulholland agreed to undertake a repair project on our gate that no other company would attempt.  The repair was a success and saved us from buying new gates.  We are fans!

Mulhollan Security was extremely helpful all the way, from customer service to getting my door fixed. Dispatcher was extremely helpful and very friendly, she made sure the locksmith was at my door ASAP! (Sameday) Now  That’s service! Locksmith (TUtu) is amazing, uber knowledgable in terms of fixing and saved me money! I definitely will use their service again and definitely recommend them !!!! :)< /review>

<review>Great Company to work with. Avi is always taking care that everything will be taken care and security will be enhanced. I had an issue, I called Avi and he quickly responded, came over, helped, and solve my security problem. And Avi is a lot of fun to listen to, and get some great security tips.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Cozy little coffee shop that is oddly also a mushroom health supplement shop. The coffee is delicious, made from beans by Chromatic Coffee Roasters. You can also ask for a shot of chaga mushroom tincture to be added to your coffee at a small additional cost. They sell extracts from various different mushrooms with purported medicinal properties as tinctures, as well as powder made from dried mushrooms. I'm not sure what's going on with the crystals decorating the shop, but it looked like some of the ones on the tables had price tags, so maybe they are for sale.

They have some small food items and pastries, but no full meals. If you're more hungry, there are often food trucks across 2nd Street.</Text>

Finally, a coffee shop with no line and some space. I know there is trendy coffee right around the corner, but this place is solid — sans the drama.</Text>

This place has a good vibe to it and feels very modern. Most of the food is pre-made, but tastes fine (the meatloaf was good). A little on the pricey side for what you get though.<//text>

This place is more impressive for drinks than for food.

The Fearless Fog is tasty, a yerba mate soy latte sweetened with honey. The sandwiches are fine, I wish they were served warm or felt more made-to-order instead of just grab and go. In particular the roasted turkey & swiss was far too much bread, not enough stuff, and was generally lacking in flavor.

I'll be back for coffee and tea but I'll eat elsewhere.<//Text>

I've had a breakfast-type sandwich here, a regular coffee and a 'cold brew' coffee.  The breakfast sandwich was, in addition to being overpriced, decent if a bit greasy/drippy, the regular coffee was sadly burned and the 'cold brew'  wasn't actually cold brew.  They just hot-brew their normal coffee, then chill it and put ice in it.  Quizzically it's a dollar more expensive than their hot coffee which is already expensive.  If I wanted burned, bitter coffee, I'd go to a *$'s and pay less for the inevitable stomach cramps.
tldr: high-dollar everything, bitter/burned coffee and acceptable breakfast items< /Text>

Was excited about trying some of their advertised single-origin Coffee's...but "barista" said she didn't know how to make a pour-over. So I was regulated to a drip coffee...which thankfully was above-average.< /review>

I would eat my jook in a nook, with a book, while people look.

Great little cafe, polite staff, good prices, clean, in a good area.< /Text>

It's pricey.   I know coffee in SOMA ain't cheap but when they fill little fancy bags with that giant Mr.  Espresso bag and call it their 2nd street blend it feels wrong.< /Text>

I recently rented a bike through Golden Gate rides over the weekend of May 20th 2021, the owner was super friendly and gave some really good tips regarding where to go and what to see. I cannot recommend Golden Gate Rides enough! The customer service was exceptional and I am definitely going back again to rent, I would not consider anywhere else. The bike I rented was brand new, and if I had the opportunity, would love to buy that same bike for myself. Please check them out!<//Text>

Thanks for the outstanding service! The owner set me up with a quality bike, helmet, map, drink, and route suggestions for a great ride. Be sure to call ahead during these strange times since walk ins are not allowed. I will absolutely rent from Golden Gate Rides on my next visit.</text>

I was visiting SF for a week and gave myself the weekend to play in the bathroom area. I found Golden Gate Rides and met Daniel how was very helpful and generous in renting me a bike.

I got my hands on a hard tail giant in excellent shape, hardly ridden. I tuned up the brakes a bit first but the drive train was in excellent shape, smooth shifting. Daniel hooked me up with a helmet, a lot and a tool bag with flat repair kit (tube, patches, CO2  tire irons and multi-tool). I paid $28 for a half day and got the next full day half off for $20.

For a higher price they have top notch road and mtn bikes for good shredding in the area and they'll shuttle you to your destination for a small charge - neat service I may use next time to explore farther away.

I took the bike around the city - golden gate park out to the ocean beach and lands end the first day. On the second I went over the golden gate and up and around the Marin Headlands, rodeo beach and Golden Gate recreation Area. The bike was solid the whole way. I noticed bikes from other companies were heavily branded (ex BLAZING SADDLES! COME RENT ME) makes people instantly identifiable as tourists and the bikes don't look as nice.

The location is in the tenderloin, which some consider seedy, but I had no problem or fears visiting their store front or returning after dark. It's not as bad as people say (nice speakeasy across the street).

Highly recommend! A bike can take you wonderful places.< /text>

Fantastic bike shop. A rare find, really. The owner and shop manager/staff in general are all so helpful/honest/kind. The rates for short and long term bicycle rental programs are super good. I loved the bike that I rented monthly from these guys. I would do it again in a heartbeat.<//Text>

They provided a carbon racing bike which ran beautifully. I spent the day whizzing around the otherside of the Bay ($40 well spent!). I ran a flat tire and when I brought it back they were very understanding and told me not to worry. They even showed me how to replace a tire 😂</review>< pics>

Very flexible, we could pick up the bikes even before the official opening hours. Bikes are quite cool and speedy but on both bikes we rented, the derailleur setup/maintenance  was not proper so the chain always jumped. At return they told us that they do service after every ride so this should not happen... :-/ but overall, a small shop with speedy bikes and friendly staff!< /Text>

Rented a bike from here last minute on a Saturday. The bikes were really well looked after, great brakes (needed in hilly san Francisco!), and they provided you with a complimentary helmet if you wanted one as well as a bike lock. It was a joy to bike with my friends across the Golden Gate bridge, into Sausalito and catch a ferry back. Great half day trip on a sunny day. Owner was friendly too which is a bonus. Thanks guys!< /Text>

<review>My mom, sister, and I had a wonderfully pleasant experience with Golden Gate Rides Bike Rental! The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgable. They explained which routes were best to take, which places to visit, and they even gave us extra rental time free of charge! The bikes were also very comfortable and reliable. I highly recommend this charming local shop for anyone looking to explore all San Francisco has to offer!<//review>< Pics>

8 dollars an hour to rent bikes.  I live in this building.  See the owner Bigyan every day.  Super nice guy.  What's cool about this for locals is it's not right inside Union Square with the rest of those bike shops where nobody knows where they should be going.

TOURISTS, what's good about this place just a short walk from your Union Square hotel is that you're NOT renting bikes right next to a parking garage.  Car rental companies lease space from them, then rent cars to TOURISTS, who also have no clue where they're going and then end up hitting you.

Golden Gate Rides is just a short 5 minute walk and besides, after all you're going on a "bike ride" ;)

Use your time wisely as a warm up, then stretch outside while your bike is readying.

Cheers and enjoy SF</text>

This is my second time leasing from Bigamy again and appears like he is gonna be my move to bicycle rental whenever I move SF again.  Friendly and personable, he has some fantastic maps and ideas.  What I love is he is prepared to change bikes based on my tastes.< /text>

I don’t know why anyone would rent bikes from somewhere else, this place has got it all. Great customer service, tips, prices and bikes. I got the hybrid electric bike and biked all over SF and across the Golden Gate Bridge. They also provide helmets. I would definitely rent another bike from here next time I’m in town!< /text>

We rented 7 bikes for about 6 hours. The bikes were good, the owner was very helpful and the prices were low despite the fact that everything is expensive in SF. If I return to the city, I'll definitely get my bike from here again.<//Text>

Great experience and excellent bikes. Bigyan is very helpful and knowledgeable of the city and culture. He’ll give you the best experience based on your schedule and desires. Very responsive... within minutes, if not immediately. Had a chain pop on one of our bikes going up one of the many steep hills and he was literally there within a few minutes with a replacement bike. My bike was awesome going fast as heck down hill and easy pedaling uphill. Biking the SF area to get to those picturesque locations, the excellent eateries, or to relax at one of the many parks is a must do and this is the best place to start. Highly recommend Bigyan and Golden Gate Rides on O’Farrell...THE Best!!!< /review>

The bicycle would not go into first gear and the small gears also need some fine tuning. They didn't explain the gears or how to change gears so if you are a beginner it may be difficult.<//review>

Great experience overall. The bikes are extremely light and high quality, making biking around San Francisco's hills easy.  We only wanted the bikes for the evening and returned them the next morning and we were only charged for a half day. The owner was also super helpful and checked on us to make sure that we were able to get the ferry back from Sausalito as it was the last one of the night. Overall great service and I will definitely be renting bikes here again next time I am in San Francisco.</Review>

<Review>Woke up at 0500 and picked up my bike at 0645. The rental shop owner is really really nice and supportive.
Knowing I am going for a long ride (actually not really long, from SF to Mountain View), he gave me everything I may need in case of emergency, including the compressed-air tank, spare tube, as well as phone mount, which I worried about before picking the bike, as I didn't have a phone mount (for sure it's important for riding to somewhere new to me).
Regarding the bike, the quality is awesome, and I didn't get flat tire about 100km ride.
I have been to other bike shops before, but this one is definitely the only option I would consider if I have to pick one.< /Review>< pics>

No hassle, no hidden fees and very accommodating. Pirced by half or full day and the hours allow you to actually get a full day of riding in. Helmet and lock included and you also get a map and route recommendations.  This location is very central to everything which makes it a great starting point to any trip. Just remember San Francisco is very hilly so do yourself a favor and just rent for the full day, your body will thank you as you wont have to be rushing to return the bike within a couple hours or else pay excessive 'late' fees like other San Fran rentals.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Excellent Service and great bikes(light with plenty of gears) tailored to riding level.  Manager assisted with routing and suggestions for my 16 year old son and me.  Pricing VERY reasonable, and no bait and switch like we experienced with first rental place who lured is in with good pricing for only a heavy 'cruiser' bike, which is great if San Fransisco were flat!    Good luck in your search, but can't go wrong with this place.<//text>< pics>

Booked weeks ago to pick up a road bike at 0630. E-mailed, phoned and tried to contact loads of times to discuss details but never a response. Just turned up now and the place is locked up and dark. Not answering either of the phone numbers posted in the door.

Owner’s response to this is misleading. The website says shut Tuesday and Wednesday (not Thursday) and I’ve still not been refunded. The only response I’ve had is to this review and this was posted after I had turned up in the dark to find a locked up shop. No apology.</Review>

We had an amazing day biking around the city and over the Golden Gate Bridge. High quality bikes made a tough ride with heavy winds  enjoyable. We were able to rent both hybrids and road bikes, so the whole family was happy. Rates were reasonable. The shop owner, Bigyan, was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!<//review>

Awesome place to rent a bike! The owner is a very relaxed guy and knows a lot about bikes. As a Dutch person who cycles everyday, I think this is very important, especially after a bad experience a few days before. The owner was very helpful in picking the right size and even the sadles could be exchanged if it was too hard or soft for your liking. I ended up with a quite new, light and comfortable Cannondale bike with good brakes. The owner sent us on our way with lots and lots of helpful tips, and after 50 km of fun and nice sights I had a hard time parting with my bike again. The price was just a few dollars more than most bike shops, but the bikes are a lot better, so it's definately worth it. Would recommend this place to anyone!<//text>

Great service. Rented a bike twice over a long weekend. First one was a decent Cannondale hybrid that rode very well for a rental bike although it needed a few adjustments in the shifting. Another day I rented a Marin mountain bike that was a great ride too. Friendly people, and they seem organized.</Review>

They made multiple adjustments, including switching pedals, saddles, etc to make us more comfortable.  They had performance road bikes, mtn bikes, standard touring bikes, and e-bikes.  You get 50% off after the first rental.  The bikes seemed to be in great mechanical shape.  I would suggest sticking with these guys instead of the other outfits near the tourist areas.  Seemed like more personal attention and customer service here.<//Review>< UserId.>

< review>
We had an amazing experience with this company. There is a price reduction if you rent the bikes more than one day, the bikes were high quality bikes (light and good gears) which were excellent maintained. Also we got a lot of personal advise for which streets we should use or avoid. Which is very handy in a city with the hills of San Francisco. Also they had a fun picture game going on which gave our bike ride a playful touch. They offer a free service to come and repair your tire when it's flat, a service we luckily did not have to use.
When I look to the quality of the other bikes which are rented in the city and combine it with the personal service, I can only conclude this is the best bike rental service in San Francisco.</review>

Had a wonderful experience at this bike rental. The price was very reasonable and they were very generous with their resources. Their unique E-Bikes are incredible and i would highly recommend them as they make riding around the hilly SF a much more pleasant experience. Would definitely go back.</Review>

I haven't tried any other bike rental shop in SF, but I'm certain that Golden Gate Rides Bike Rental is among the best: 1) super welcoming, knowledgeable & friendly staff. 2) well-maintained & high quality bikes without any branding that makes you look like a tourist ;). 3) free water, nap, helmet and phone strap.

Will rent again from here! You should too.<//Review>

<Review>We randomly found this rental location online.  I called as we were leaving our hotel and they told us they had a large group coming in but they could accommodate us last minute.  Since they were low on bikes by the time we showed up we ended up with a top of the line carbon bike.  It was incredible.  Riding all the hills in San Francisco was way easier.  We rode over to Sausalito and flew by all the tourists with their rental bike (you can tell because it says their brand all over the bike).  Everyone else was walking their bikes.  Even when we got on the ferry to come back the guy who takes care of all the bikes complimented me on our bikes.  He was blown away that it was a rental.  The staff at Golden Gate Rides were so nice and accommodating.  Offered us coffee and drinks while we waited.  I left my phone in the bag on my bike and they drove it to my hotel!  If you want a great experience and a great bike (that doesn't make you feel like a dorky tourist) then this is your place.  Highlight of our trip!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Wonderful owner and amazing deals. He offered to my 3 friends full day bike with price if half day. One of them got a flat tire, he came with his car and switched the bike for no extra. Due to an injury, I couldn't rent. Despite that, he offered us all water and snacks and helped to organize our tourism plan. Clean place and sturdy bikes. Absolutely to recommend!!< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pics>

Its a great store by a laundromat and cafe. We did some laundry and got yummy pastries. They offered to switch out bikes anytime if we decided we wanted a different kind.

If you want to rent a bike in San Francisco this is the place to do that! The shop is located downtown, the bikes are excellent and the staff is amazing. We rented two bikes for a day and had the best time. Really glad we found this place. Easiest 5 starts I've given.

My friend and I went to San Francisco and only had a day to see the sites so we reserved two bikes.  Miguel gave us great information on where to ride to make sure we saw everything.  It was a great way to get around and Miguel was super helpful.</Text>

Excellent service, awesome staff...I was kinda timid about SF traffic and hills but Ray drew a route that took in sites including the Golden Gate Bridge, with just a few hills, and not to bad at that compared to some of the hills in this town.<//Text>

There's a reason this place has all these five star reviews! They have a great selection of bikes - from full carbon road bikes to mountain bikes to city hybrids. Very reasonable prices too. Set apart, however, by the friendliest owner in SF. Expect free snacks, random discounts and, if you're lucky, some business advice. Don't go anywhere else!<//Text>

I went here for the first time today, and it was phenomenal. I walked in around 1:00 PM, and even though most of the bikes were gone I got hooked up with an amazing bike. The prices were fantastic, and the owner really has a passion for bicycles. Highly recommend to all bike renters out there!!</text>

I'm convinced that there isn't a better bike rental place in the city. The bikes are great and well maintained, and there are many to choose from. They also provide you with locks & Helmets if needed.

My girlfriend and I rented bikes from here and she got into a little accident and couldn't ride anymore. We called them up and they came and picked us up! Amazing service. I wouldn't rent from anywhere else in San Francisco.<//Text>

<review>When I travel I usually try to rent a bike when I go.  The quality can vary greatly. I was able to rent for a half a day a Carbon fiber bike with disc brakes.  I rode it across the Golden Gate bridge to the Marin headlands.  The bike worked great.  I was able to keep up with the performance bicyclists.  The only giveaways were my bike shop rental helmet and my running shoes.  He will let you bring your bike shoes and pedals and will put them on for you if you want.<//review>< UserId.>

I booked on Nov 2019 an electric bike..which was not available (in fact no electric bike are currently in rent but they don't update their website). So they proposed to switch to a hybrid bike and get a refund for the price gap.
Edit : I finally received the refund 3 weeks later, so raising evaluation to 3/5.<//Text>

First of all, the owner Bigyan is simply amazing. Great guy, down to earth,friendly and fun to talk to. This is probably the best decision that I've made on this visit to San Fran. Biking is a great way to go around and explore the city. Second, the bikes are great, well maintained and fun to ride. Anyway, if u are looking for a place to rent a bike. This is the place to go!< /Text>

You should go and rent here. I had the time of my life riding across the Golden Gate. The bike I  rented was like new and was perfectly set up, and that made my trip very comfortable and safe. Every question was answered by him, he explained me everything on how to go to the bridge and came back. Go rent here, is the best place.<//review>

Golden Gate Rides ended up being the best way to tour San Francisco! I was able to see all ends of the city in one day - The Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, California Academy of Sciences, etc.

I showed up without a reservation and was offered a free coffee while the paper work and bike were prepped. The variety of bikes/sizes and custom seat adjustment made sure I would be comfortable for the duration of the day. I was also sent off with a helmet, lock and water bottle.

The bike itself was in great condition, very smooth ride and gears shifted turnout any issues (so important for the San Francisco hilly landscape). In total, I biked 50 miles that day and saw so much of the city! Would definitely recommend as a way to tour the city to anyone visiting.</review>

<review>Ok, this bike shop is just amazing. I went to san fransisco from montreal to do the escape from Alcatraz triathlon. Reserved the bike, got a brand new carbon ultegra road bike. They took time to change wheels to help me gain few minutes during the race. The evening before the race, I felt pretty hard. I called them and despite they were closing, they waited for me and check up the bike, replaced some pieces to make sure I would be alright for my race. Friendly and dedicated, they did not charged me for anything !!! After the race, I returned the bike... and forgot my power meter pedals (worth 600$ ) .. flight back to montreal ... and realized the pedals were missing. After a call, the pedals were sent the day after abroad. They literally saved my triathlon, which was the main purpose of the whole trip. Honestly, it felt refreshing to meet so nice people on this earth !!! Fun, nice, honest, passionate ... I could emphasize enough on how much this is the right place to go. They have a quite wide choice of bike and can arrange to any situation!!!! Thank you again so much !!!! Toto< /review>< Pics>

These guys are great - really take care of you. First time I rented they hooked me up with extra GoPro batteries... Who does that?!

Second time they had cliff bars and water on hand which was definitely a life saver for me.

The bikes were in perfect condition and road like a breeze.

Their prices are very reasonable and if you are a repeat customer they hook you with with a discount as well.

Definitely renting from them every time I'm in SF< /Review>

This was a great experience. I’ve always wanted to hit the roads in SF. I was able to rent a solid CAAD12 and I was set up with some shoes and a helmet. Did a great 30 mile route. The bike was a lot of fun! Bigyan was in contact with me the whole way and had the bike ready for me. If you are getting a real bike, is say know bikes. You are provided with the necessary tools for a flat et . It was a fantastic ride. I’ll be back!< /text>

Great prices, FAST Cannondale Quick bike in decent shape, helmet and lock included?! SWEET! Only thing I could ask for is tune the bike up before giving it to me, as the rear derailleur was skipping and the brakes needed to be tightened. Thanks, guys, I'm definitely coming back next time I'm in SF!<//Text>

<text>Best bike rental in SF! Great quality bikes, both hybrids and road bikes. Friendly staff, the owner helped me out and was very knowledgable. He gave me his personal number in case there were any issues, as well as a great explanation of bike routes + a map and a bottle of water.

He also said that if you rent a second time from them, it is half off. And even before that, it is still one of the most affordable rentals in town. Highly recommend it!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

When deciding what to do in San Francisco, the idea of a bike ride came up. But where to make a reservation? Golden Gate Rides Bike Rentals was a coincidence, but what a great coincidence! Smashing bikes, great service, what more did we want? Bikes were delivered and picked up by the hotel aswell. When we come back to San Francisco we will rent bikes with this firm again. Once again: thanks for your friendliness and great service. Regards from Belgium. Henrie and Laureen<//text>

<Review>Awesome place! No hassle, I walked in and out in a short time. The shop was deceptive because it was shared, but wasn't a problem at all. The guy running the place drew on a map of all the attractions and the best way to go. Highly recommended.< /Review>< response>

<text>Had a very positive experience renting from here. The bikes are new, light and fast.  The owners are great and very helpful. And all returning customers get half off on all future rentals so I will def rent again next time I am in town. Trip over GG bridge was very enjoyable.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I can't say enough good things about my experience renting a bike for a half day!  Bigyan set me up on a great bike, at a great price.  He gave me advice on my route and just bent over backwards to make me happy.  I had a truly unforgettable experience on my ride and Bigyan was a big part of the reason!  Will definitely recommend this to my co-workers and friends!<//text>

The staff were amazing, the prices were reasonable and the bikes were in good condition and well fitting. I rental for three days, 11 hours total, and the total price of rental of only $53. After riding the first time, I received a 50% discount on my next ones. I was also able to call in advance for my party of 5 and have all the different sized bikes ready to go. I definitely recommend this shop above all others.</text>

<Text>Some of the best service I have ever received, anywhere, ever. I showed up at this store with my freshly assembled Burning Man bike at 8am. My bus was leaving at 10am, and this was only place open to assist me with changing a defective inner tube. I owe the staff here my boundless gratitude for assisting me. Without them, I would have left for the desert with a defective bike. I made my bus and I owe part of my other worldly experience to this store.
When in San Francisco, I wouldn’t rent a bike from anywhere else!</Text>< Response>

- The owner came to late to the arranged appointment for the bike rental + 6 out of 8 bikes did not have enough air in their tires and the batteries were not fully charged.

- For this reason, we were able to leave late - but had to pay from 8 o'clock

- We agreed that we would bring the bikes back at 12:30 and pay only the hours in between instead of a full-day rental. Here the owner promised us that he will transfer the money difference (we had to pay before we rent) to our bank account. The money has not arrived yet (3 weeks back from vacation).<//text>
<resp>{'time': 1537129331240, 'text': "Hi Christian\n\nTo make matters clear here for folks reading, I'd like to mention the following. The reservation was under Anna and not Christian but Anna's reservation was set for 8am online and that's when i showed up to work. The bikes had been ready to go the night before. I don't see how that is an issue that a few minutes were spent in explaining to you the routes and such, that's standard procedure because we have to make you aware of the nuances of riding an e-bike in San Francisco. We weren't made aware of the fact that they had other plans for which we refunded a total of $250 some dollars after they returned early.\n\nThe fact that we gave less air and battery is an outright misjudgement of us, I have to say. Why would we want the trouble? plus you were offered to call us on Whatsapp/Viber in case of any issues which we always respond to service calls immediately! We never received any service calls from you. We would rush you a new bike anytime.\n\nThe total cost you had paid for is $496.93 because we kept going back and forth from city hybrid to e-bikes and the discounts you wanted.\n\nThe regular cost for all e-bikes is $325.50 (for 6 half days e-bikes) and  + $148.50 (for two full days e-bikes) = $474.00 which you forgot to mention in your review two of your friends came after a full days ride. Only six of you returned at 12:30 PM which is considered a half day (under 6 hours) from 8am-12:30pm.\n\nYou are entitled a refund for $474.00- ($227 + $ 22.93) = $249.93 which by the way the credit card you should have received. We charged half day even though the original was supposed to be a full day, which mind you hurts our ability to gain revenue on such. I understand you might think the situation calls for a full refund, but i gave back what I felt was right for half a day worth of usage on our bikes.\n\nPlease be aware that an average waiting time to receive bikes is 10-20 minutes your first time getting bikes with us, and is no way our intention to stall anyone longer than necessary. If you have plans such as museums where you are going to be away from bikes too long such as Alcatraz, it'd be nice to know beforehand so we can better prepare you.\n\nLet me know if that answers your queries and please please when and if you decide to ride with us, communicate with us so we can help make your experience better."}</resp>< rating>

<review>My wife and I went on a tour lead by Bigyan with Golden Gate Rides. As a disclaimer I am an avid cyclist, but the shop is able to accommodate all types/ skill levels from bike type and route difficulty. The bikes were quality, from road bikes to mountain bikes.
Overall the tour was, 1) lots of fun 2) a way to see lots of San Francisco in a short, 'high-yield' period of time 3) did I say fun already? 4) an excellent value.

Bigyan was very easy to hang out with all afternoon, he wants to do what you want to do. I can't imagine another outfit making the process more easy and relaxed, or renting bikes of a similar quality.
I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to go for a ride to see the city, and would not hesitate to take family and friends if I am back in San Francisco.< /review>< Name>

My wife and I decided we wanted to go for a bike ride around the bridge and golden gate park and we decided to call this place (which was newly established) because it was the closest to where we were staying. Upon calling to reserve, the guy there asked us our height and bike preferences and had two like new bikes ready to go with helmets and locks in the morning. He took the time to explain what routes to take and what event was happening on that day, so we biked through the park and ended up riding the bridge and hanging out at the picnic in the Presidio! It was an awesome day and very smooth riding their bikes around town. Will definitely try other routes when we are back in town.<//review>

<review>They just made my day in SF!!! I was in the city half day and I wanted to see as much as I could, so I wanted to rent a bike. I saw all the reviews were a 5 so I left my luggage at the Chancellor and went there. They have really nice bikes (they work with cannondale) at very reasonable prices! Half day rates are less than $30  and you get a lock and a helmet. I rented a fixed gear and had an amazing experience.
I wouldn't try anywhere else.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I covered over 40 miles in a day and am really glad I went with a high end rental. Biggest difference was the smaller backpack they suggested I borrow so I could leave my bulky travelling gear at their shop. They also make a mean breakfast sandwich to fuel up while you're setting up the rental.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great place!  I biked around San Francisco after reading reviews on this bike rental shop.  They take walk ins, though ideally you would reserve online ahead of time.  I showed up unannounced in the morning and gave the owner a small scare!  Still, he was very friendly, set me up with a very roadworthy bike + helmet, and locks.  The shop also has maps of tour spots and bike routes.  Would recommend if you're in the area and want to bike.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Review>Really great bike rental - excellent value for money, way cheaper than everywhere else in SF! Bigyan gave us a heavy discount on the road bike rental as it was the only bike left in my girlfriend's size, and it was a really nice bike.

The rest of the bikes are far better than what you get from many other places in SF. As well as that, it's a great place to stop for a snack or a beer during your ride.

As well as that Bigyan is extremely friendly and helpful, and gave us free bottles of water!

Great place, can't recommend enough.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Rented four electric bikes for a sunny day in SF and were told the range on the bikes would be 20-30 miles, depending on how efficient you ride it. Went through the planned route with one of the employees and some quick instructions and we were on our way.

Just after a few miles we noticed the battery level on two of the bikes were already starting to decrease fast, so we tried to ride them as efficient as possible, but after reaching 12-13 miles two of the bikes were already the lowest battery level so we were expecting them to die pretty soon.

At this point we were in Sausalito so we had to ditch our planned route of coming back over the brigde and decided to take the ferry instead, due to the low battery level. This ended up costing us an extra 12.5$ pr. person. After getting off the ferry we drove through the city and ended up getting back to the shop with the battery still holding up on all bikes, which was an positive suprise.

Upon arrival one on the employees asked us if everything was as expected and told them about the battery indicator being at the lowest point very early and about two of the backbrakes not being 100% on the bikes. Did not get the chance to mention this at the site, but the suspension on all bike were really poor also, which made the ride uncomfortable.

This eventually led up to me having a longer discussion with the manager that totally ruined this experience us. Whatever we told him, there would follow a longer explanation as to why we were wrong and he was right, not willing to listen to what we had to say. Instead, he kept on talking about unrelated matters and trying to steer away from the real issue, that the bikes performed poorly. Eventually we got him to take one of the bikes out and got him to admit that the brakes were not working 100%. From the discussion we learned that we had also not been given all of the instructions needed as to how the bike and battery indicator works, and the manager at this point told us that we should read the manual before riding a bike like this (what?).

The experience in itself was maybe three stars, but followed by an discussion with an arrogant manager, not willing to listen to what his customer has to say, I see no option to give this just the one star. Expensive as well, several cheaper companies in the area.< /Review>< Rating>

<Review>Excellent quality bikes, be sure to reserve online or call in advance to ensure someone's there when you arrive (operates out of the back of a coffee shop / laundromat).

Would highly recommend for anyone looking to rent bikes in SF. Service and price can't be beat.</Review>< pictures>

I needed a serious road bike for a 100 mile ride north of Golden Gate Bridge. Easy website, followed up with good, responsive and personal service. Bigyan made sure the bike was fitted, put the right pedals on and I was on my way at 7am.</Review>

A small outfit with excellent, friendly service, Binyan was very helpful suggesting routes and the city I could take and the hybrid Cannondale bike was speedy, in good condition and a pleasure to ride. Unfortunately my ride was cut short by an accident (entirely down to my own carelessness) but Binyan was great about it and dropped everything to come and collect the bike and take me to urgent care, and he called later to check I was OK. I felt like he went the extra mile to take care of me and would have no hesitation recommending this place to any visitor wanting to tour San Francisco by bike.< /Text>

WOWZER!! Best bike experience!! The guy was amazingly accommodating, fit the bikes to us and gave us great pointers on where to go and what to see. They even hooked us up with some water for the road. Best of all we were rocking 2 Giant Escape models . They were fantastic for the hills I mean SLAYED  at the climb! -and we did a lot of climbing! We passed many MANY bikers who were walking the hills with their rental bikes in hand b/c they couldn't cut it. Saw a lot of Blazing Saddles bikes out there getting walked.

Safe to say you CAN NOT go wrong with the price quality and service you will get from this cool little establishment, BT-dubz It's inside of a laundry-mat/ bar/ coffee joint. little hard to find- but you'll see beyond the bar, bikes all over. lots of nice bikes, Giants and Cannonadales and maybe some specialized.< /text>

The guys from Golden Gate Rides were awesome. They gave us free coffee before and after our ride, told us about some great spots to ride, and hooked up up with some UNBELIEVABLE bikes. The bikes were high end Cannondale road bikes. My fiance and I have been cycling for 5 years, but have never ridden as nice of bikes as GGR provided. I don't think think we would have been able to handle all the hills in the city without them. I would highly recommend GGR to anyone. Great Dudes, GGR rocks!< /review>

I was searching for a bike rental online to get around in San Francisco. I found Golden Gates Ride with its perfect rating and did not get dissapointed.

The Rental was super easy. As it was raining that day Bigyan also gave me a helmet and soon I hit the road. Though the weather was changeable I had a nice ride through Golden Gate Park and over the Golden Gate Bridge. However, close to the Point Bonita Light House I got unlucky, and a small glass splinter flattened my front tire. Calling back to the renal, Bigyan was super helpful. As he couldn't come himself right away he called me an Uber cab at his expense that brought me and the broken bike to the shop. Quite a memorable day for my. But whenever I come back to SF I'm sure where I'll rent my bike :)<//review>

{'time': 1496286652009, 'text': "Hi Thomas\n\nWe are sorry you feel that way. Upon checking the cameras during the time when you returned, your bike looked like the locks were obstructing the front brakes with the amount of weight that was put on it. You rode the largest bike with the largest lock we have, so if you put weights on parts of a bike like that, its only natural the weight will push against the cables and the brake pads. We had instructed you to call us if you had any problems during the ride, which we don't see any calls from you so there's no way we would have known how your ride is going. We could have helped you if you did. We knowingly would never give you a bike that doesn't function well.\n\nSorry but we can't provide refunds for situations beyond our control and specially when you let us know the problem after the ride is over. I hope you and our future customers find this response useful."}<//Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) AIRLINE CREW CAN GET A 50% DISCOUNT!

The owner is very friendly
If you're going to go to Sausalito or a battery spanner, I recommend an electric bike!
If you want your thighs to burst, just rent a bicycle.
50% discount by showing the airline ID (photo available)

If you go three blocks to the left from the shop, you will find POLK STREET
There is no hill on the road, so it is easy to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.

AIRLINE CREW CAN GET A 50% DISCOUNT!

주인이 매우 친절함
소살리토나 베터리 스팬서 갈거면 전기 자전거 강추!
허벅지 터지고 싶으면 그냥 자전거 빌리세요ㅋㅋ
항공사 아이디(사진 가능) 보여주면 50% 할인해줌

샵에서 왼쪽으로 세 블럭 가면 POLK STREET 나오는데
그 길은 언덕이 없어서 금문교 까지 가는데 편함.</Review>< Pictures>

자전거를 빌려서 여행 중에 고장이 났었는데, 1시간 이내로 트럭으로 새로운 자전거를 가져다 줬습니다.

왠만하면 글로 리뷰 안남기는데 좋은곳이라고 생각해서 이렇게 글 남깁니다. 미국 여행하면서 처음으로 직원한테 감동했네요 정말 친절하고 자전거 상태도 다른 대여점보다 매우 좋습니다. 물이나 간단한 스낵같은것을 무상으로 주는것도 좋았습니다. 혹시 자전거 대여하실 생각이신 분들은 꼭 여기서 빌리세요 강추!!!

Out of season, the store is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (lunch break between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.), but you can book by phone outside these hours. For $ 40 a day, I got a good Geant bike with anti-theft, helmet, city map giving bike routes, a bottle of water and all the explanations to make my day a success. Very friendly staff. The city's many bicycle routes make it an ideal mode of transportation if you want to get out of downtown

<rate>1< /rate><review>(Translated by Google) As for the ticket purchase place, it is like a half day price.
If the price is borrowed n times
Ticket price * n = Total payment price?
ex) 9.78 * 4 (hour) = ???

<text>First trip to a laundromat in a long time. My washer leaked last time. This place was close by AND got good reviews. I crammed a lot of shirts and slacks into a front loading washer. I added my own laundry detergent. It cost $3. either by credit card or quarters. It ran for 30 minutes. They do have a bank of dryers there. But my dryer is still working, so I just bagged the clothes to dry at home.<//text></record>
</dataset><record>
<Text>Was a bit messy, when arrived. Almost slipped on one of the dryer softener sheets just dropped all on the floor. There must be cctv because an attendant came to sweep up few mins after. I come here now and then for big loads. Looks like the price has gone up, the basic bucket washers used to be $1.75 are now $2.00; went up a quarter.
Overall clean and they have diverse sizes including super load called Big Bertha which is like $7.
They have updated payment now to include a swipe or tap module to each device incase you have no cash. The dryers do really well.</Text>< Time>

I needed to go to a Laundromat. This is the first time in years I have had to drag my clothes to one. Wasn't looking forward to it. But I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Previous laundromats that i had had to go to years ago were awful. This one was clean. It had plenty of tables to fold your clothes on after drying. Workers walking around dealing with questions from the customers. A number of change machines located on either side of the place. And no kids or adults sitting on the tables because of the constant watch of the employees. The washers were kept very clean also.< /Review>< name>

Variety of sizes of washing machines from the classic top load to the new front load washers, equipped with amenities such as vending machines, TV, and free Wi-Fi, plenty of dryers uniquely named vs #, and prices are reasonable. Can pay with coin or with visa at each washer/dryer.< /review>

<user_name>J</user_name><review>Great place for wash and fold service. Inexpensive

Edit (1/9/2018): They mixed up our laundry with someone else, the attendant almost refused until I called the owner. We never got our missing clothes back, but we did return the clothes regardless (because who wants someone else's clothes anyway). We got our refund later that night but I was already pissed and angry at this messup.

We had been going there for over a year and they go about mixing our clothes?! I feel betrayed and the way we had to get our money back was absurd to say the least.

I do not recommend the wash and fold, but if services and accuracy improves I'd definitely change my review to a 3.<//review>< response>

Good service. Lovely patio area. Prices on the high end of moderate. Food only okay. Looks good, but taste is just not there.< /Text>

Tried most of their items and it’s more like a 3.5, so it’s pretty good on some items. They started to charge a labor surcharge of 3.5%. I’ve tried the salmon bowl, poke bowls, most salads, some of their specials. It’s pretty good but expensive.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Wow, they charged me 3% Labor Surcharge for a to go food and without giving me a notice about it. Also, the lady taking orders is always in a bad mood, she needs more preparation and she needs to look more presentable. I wont be coming back to UTC La Jolla area and now I understand why my co-workers go to the mall for lunch.</Text>< Time>

<text>Bistro 24 is a medium sized, full kitchen restaurant. Located below one of La Jolla's most striking new office buildings-Irvine Company's La Jolla One. This eatery serves professionals working in two other nearby buildings, making it very busy. The food is high-end with a chef's touch. I had a mouthwatering barbecue chicken wrap the other day that exploded with flavor. I think I noticed beans and cilantro !<//text>< UserId.>

<text>Great location, decent quality of food, high price, long waiting. I had to leave without lunch because I ran out of time and patience waiting for the food. When I asked it looked  like they had lost my order or something. Very unprofessional attitude for a place dedicated to corporate offices.</text>< pictures>

Brenda earned each and every star...she was wonderful!! Super friendly, fast and very professional. I felt at ease and completely comfortable right upon meeting her. I am what they call a "hard stick". My veins are small/thin and I have always had trouble with needles and blood withdrawals. Due to past issues I'm traumatized and go into panic mode and my anxiety goes through the roof. I couldn't be more thankful for having Brenda withdraw my blood. I honestly could say I did not feel a thing from start to finish. If ever I need my blood drawn again I hope to be able to get Brenda back. Thank you again Brenda you are the very best at what you do...it was a pleasure meeting you!!!< /Text>

Kirsten was the name of the nurse and she really went above and beyond the call of duty. Super caring and loving. She stayed longer than we booked her just to make sure everything was going to be okay when she left. I am super grateful for the attention and care that was given. The follow up call was the final touch of such great service. It was an extraordinary customer experience. I am super happy that I found them especially if it is needed in the future. I highly recommend the mobile drip therapy in a heartbeat. Five star service with a smile. Thank you so much!!! 💖</review>

< review>
First off, Annabelle is a sweetheart with a big heart full of thoughtfulness for many people. I am lucky to experience her care. She sent Michelle over to do an IV energy boost within the same day. Michelle was an extraordinary nurse, extremely professional, sensitive to my needs, extremely thorough during the process, and was great company during my treatment. I highly recommend Services! They are amazing! Thank you ladies, we will see you soon!</review>

Wonderful nurses, wonderful service. My 82yr old dad needed to have fluids administered when his bout with Covid-19 was poorly treated at our local hospital. Even with great PPO Ins hospitals used this virus to show their incompetence. Thankfully Drip Hydration was able to help</review>

This was fast easy convenient.  We live in AZ, and it’s pretty difficult to get rapid Covid testing same day. Appointments have been 3 days out and lines are long at testing site. I have two aging parent who cannot wait all day just to get tested.  We were exposed by our home health aid, and Christmas is right around the corner. If we couldn’t get proof negative they would have missed out on their grand babies. I booked the appointment in the morning, the scheduling person called me back and booked me for same afternoon. Our tech   C. Romo was professional, proficient, patient, and polite. She was on and out. We received are results via phone a few hour later. It was a good experience, and peace of mind was worth the price. Spending Christmas with my nephews... priceless.<//Text>

<text>First I want to start by thanking Annabel for taking my call at 9 pm. I was really dehydrated and needed someone to come asap, which they did. I love a business that takes pride and has work ethic. Nurse Alison came to my rescue, boy was she great! Love the whole experience and will keep using them. Thank you guys so much. I highly recommend this company.< /text>< pics>

My son is a professional athlete and competes in hot humid conditions so we like to get him a good top off on hydration before his races and Drip Hydration accomplishes this perfectly. Our nurse Michelle has been wonderful and we’ve been able to request her specifically for the last three weekly sessions we’ve had.

Drip Hydration IE and United Lab Services are the absolute best. From the personal attention and unparralled customer service, they're hands down the leaders in IV therapy and Covid testing. I've been a customer for 2 years now because of the quality of their service and employees.</Review>

I enjoyed my visit by Susana. She was professional and made me feel very comfortable while she started my IV. (Didn’t feel a thing). The hour went by so fast since we had a very nice conversation. My daughter (she’s 24) was sitting with me and also said what a nice experience and she can’t wait to have her own visit. I felt great after. I slept like rock that night, best sleep I’ve had in weeks!! I recommend this company it was a very easy appointment to set up. From Steven the person that called me to set up appt the doc was very thorough and especially RN Susan. She was amazing! Thank you Drip Hydration!!< /Text>

This company is AMAZING!!!  After falling through the cracks with the VA, an emergent need of hydration was needed prior to next round of Chemo. Came out next day!  (They do have same day service). They saved they day AND patient is MUCH more alert and willing to drink and eat. I will be a walking billboard for Drip Hydration. Send me shirts, flyers or whatever. I am telling everyone about their services. Thank you SO Much ❤️</review>

<text>Clerk and store manager were very helpful ana fast. HUGE difference from poor customer service at other Auto Zone located down the street near Broadway and E st. Staff is condescending and usually don't know what they're talking about so I ended up going to O'Reilly's next door.< /text>< pictures>

It's always a good visit at this AutoZone from the store manager to the bottom of the list of workers I have to say they are great help . I have gone to other AutoZone stores and it's not to friendly but here on Jst and Broadway it's great . I do have to say this 65% of the time I have to travel to another AutoZone for some reason they don't have what I'm looking for . It's an inconvenience, but not only this one all of them are like that always get sent to the HUB AutoZone! Why< /text>

< Review>
Very helpful and accommodating team at this location. My fuel pump committed suicide on me and my truck limped to this AutoZone from the freeway.
They went above and beyond to help when they really didn't have to.
They managed to help me and still deal with the many customers inside so the line didn't start creeping too long.
I've been to other locations where the older woman in front of me needed their help to put a quart of oil in their car and I end up waiting ten minutes because of it but these guys were on it.
They run a good store over there. Highly recommend this location.
Thanks guys.<//Review>

What can I say? We all shop at AutoZone from time to time, whether it be a jug of oil and a filter for an oil change or a replacement sensor for your car AutoZone will have it. One really cool thing they do is they will find out why your check engine light is on for free with a quick ODB 2 computer diagnostic.<//Text>

Took in my broken alternator to get tested and was told it passed after I knew it was broken and had a lifetime warranty. Was mad, had to go to another location to retest and just as I suspected was broken. They sent me back to the original location who had just told me it wasn't broken. Still got the new part but was a waste of my time going back and forth over the incompetent female attendant who not to mention had to get 3 other service members help her.....terrible customer service!! Don't go to this location until they hire people who actually know about cars.< /Text>

This lady was so unwanted to be there kind of attitude. She wasn't much knowledgeable of AutoZone parts nor has any customer service. You think saying "welcome to AutoZone" is all her effort she has to put in. I wish I knew her name, but was distracted by her insincere welcoming that I didn't happen to notice her tag. She been there for while. Well, all I can do is complain she needs a job too.< /text>

Horrible Customer Service. Never recommending
I may not know about cars....but at least I know about custumer service. I was attened by "Frank" who didnt say hello nor anything seemed very bothered to help. I asked about license plate lights...again I do not know much about cars.... I was hoping for the associate to tell me about the options or brands...all he did was look it up on the cumpter went to look for a pair and handed them to me.... like zero communication.... then i asked if there can be someone who can help me put the lights [or at least show me] and he went to ask another associate who they began to just back and forth... you can say no... i understand if its not part of your job.. i wasnt expecting for anyone to do the work ... i just wanted assistance... i ended up just walking out. Very unhappy and unpleasant customer service.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I give it a star just because that way it allows me to qualify, that if it were none of them I gave them, people no longer want to help you with your car or even for being a woman, they send you to talk to the manager, and not even the manager wants.

le pongo una estrella solamente porque así me deja calificar, que si por mi fuera ninguna les daba, las personas ya no te quieren ayudar con tu carro ni tan si quiera por ser mujer, te mandan hablar con el manager, y ni siquiera el manager quiere.< /Review>

<Text>I have attended this church for over 30 years. I feel that Father Maui and his staff have done the most changes in all the years I have gone there.
They are all good changes that enhance your desire to want to go to mass or just make a visit.
The 11:30 mass is my favorite. I love the chore. When they sing it sounds like angels singing and it fills the whole room.
Keep up the good work.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c29be563cd8d09:0xcb5336102c7bb3dc<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

7:30pm Mass is Spanish. Father Roberto is great at explaining the readings. Usually have to stand if you're there by 7:20pm.
Parking large lot, but like the seats inside, you have to be there early otherwise street parking which is not much.< /Text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) With all due respect, the Mass should not be used for christes by parter of the parish, the past vest the father hide in some way perhaps unconsciously bulling to the people of the third age by his way of praying. I am a believer of the Faith in Christ and I am doing everything possible to concretize myself to listen to the Holy Mass and that is depressing. Priests and pastors are human beings, and that's why they need to reflect.

(Original)
Con todo respeto , la Misa no debe ser utilizada para christes por parter de Los parrocos ,la vest pasada el padre hide en de alguna manera quizas inconcientemente bulling a Las personas de la tercera edad por su manera de rezar.  Yo soy un creyente de la Fe en Cristo y estoy haciendo lo posible por concregarme a escuchar la Santa Misa y eso es deprimente . Los sacerdotes y pastores son seres humanos tambien  por eso es necesario que reflexionen.</review>

Food is AMAZING and at a great price for the quantity! Really reminds me of food in Taiwan. Very traditional and would 10/10 recommend!<//Text>

Super authentic Taiwan cuisine that transports you to Taiwan. From the decor, to the crowded dining room, to the server manners, it's as authentic as it gets in Pleasanton thanks to the owners being from Taiwan. Ordered some traditional dishes and everything was cooked to what you would expect a local restaurant in Taiwan. For me the fried noodles was a touch below in quality due to the noodle texture not being quite on par with the best of the best. Menu prices are also more expensive than what I was expecting for the amount of food and they only accept CASH which is very inconvenient.<//review>

Dried Shrimp fried rice pretty good, there is shrimps in every bite. Pig intestines with pork blood cubes very delicious and I like the pickled vege and tofu. Three cup fried tofu is amazingly flavorful best to eat with rice</review>

Love the food here. But cash only which is really annoying.

Edit: no air conditioner, avoid visit in hot weather!</review>

We ordered the salt and pepper fish filet, green beans, combination fried rice, and basil tofu for around $45 total (not including tax). It's a pretty small mom-and-pop place located in a plaza with a gas station and Mcdonald's.

The take-out quantity was smaller than expected and was a little steep for the price as compared to other local Chinese restaurants I've been to. Perhaps the quantity is not a problem when you sit-in, but I haven't done that yet. The fried fish filet and green beans were great, the fried rice was alright (not that much shrimp or meat included and small quantity), and the basil tofu had a much stronger medicinal taste than I've had before.< /Text>< Pictures>

Service is absolutely terrible. Waited an hour for food and asked the waitress multiple times about where it was. Also forgot one of our orders. Service is a joke. The smell was also extremely bad. Did not feel clean at all.<//Review>

Small Taiwanese style noodle and lunch place.  Traditional style, not a fancy modern place but the beef noodle is my favorite in this area.  Cash only.< /Text>

The place is quaint and cozy, and it's cash only. There's usually 1 (at most 2) server, so when it gets busy, there's a slight wait. The price and food portions are decent. We enjoy ordering food here (1-2x a wk). It's closed on Mon. It's honestly one of the best authentic and well rounded Taiwanese food you can get in the Bay area.

Cafe Taiwan is so good! I love how they have some Hakka dishes. My dad's side is Hakka but I never really knew anything about it. I would definitely recommend the Taiwanese sausages and Hakka dumplings!<//Review>

<Review>Great authentic Taiwanese restaurant! Ordered the beef noodle soup and it was delicious! It had a hint of spicy but not too much. The noodles were also just right, I just can't place a finger on the type of noodles used. Service was great, probably because I spoke Chinese with the waitress. Cash only.

Although closed on Mondays, but if the Monday is a holiday, they're open and will close the following day instead.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
I have never in my life in all the different places i have lived ever experienced discrimination for being white like i did when i came to lunch at cafe Taiwan. Long story short my food was to be complete in 10 minutes it took 35 an when i complained cause it took my whole lunch up and was late back to work the lady called me a hokwai? I later found out that it means white ghost. I contacted the manager and gave him opportunity to make it right, he did nothing. Therefore i will be filing a law suit against their company.< /Review>

Cafe Taiwan is pretty authentic as far as Taiwanese goes. My recommendations would be their Spicy pork intestine and pig blood stew, stir fry vegetable any kind, deep fried tofu, and three cup chicken. I did order their fried chicken bento box but it wasn't what I expected. Normally, that usually comes with a deep fried chicken drumstick but instead, they gave me deep fried diced chicken. The flavor is also more similar to street deep fried chicken than the chicken over rice bento style.

I wish they serve stinky tofu and sticky rice sausage! That would be on my wish list for Cafe Taiwan.

What I do love the most is their friendliness. The grandma behind the counter gave my son some snacks to go for no reason! This is true Taiwanese hospitality.<//text>

<text>Amazing authentic Taiwanese food. (As said by other Taiwanese people at my table, I'm not exactly taiwanese!)

Everything that we decided to order for our party of 8 were either great choices or this restaurant just hS consistently good food. The big bowls of beef noodles were well flavored without the lingering taste of msg and fat. Fried oyster cake (forgot the name) came out crispy on the edges and almost creamy on the inside, absolutely delicious.

I would describe the service as quick and intimate. Will definitely come back for another meal soon< /text>< pics>

< review>
Cafe Taiwan came highly recommended by a Taiwanese friend. Besides the usual Chinese Cuisine (in the Cantonese style), it's well-known for their Taiwanese home cooking style.

This 'hole-in-wall' is small and gets filled up fast. Lots of families come here to eat. Just two ladies work the front so when this place gets busy plus people ordering take out, the service and food come out slowly. But that's okay because once your food hits the table you will be enjoying your time eating.

The older lady came and immediately started speaking Taiwanese /Mandarin to us (we both are Cantonese) so that was a good sign we blended well here.

For two people, we looked at our iPhones and ordered from the Taiwanese side (Hakka) of the menu.  We were not disappointed at all! Definitely would order every thing again! Hakka Dumplings (it's a soup with savory ground pork in a mochi dumpling and green veggies - would order it again in a heartbeat), Hakka Braised Pork (braised pork belly with stir fried green veggies), Ground Pork Over Rice Bowl (ground pork, pickled cabbage, half a Taiwanese Soy Sauce Egg (good 5 spice flavor) over rice), Snow Cabbage with Rice Cake (cabbage, pork, veggie and rice cake noodle), and Spicy Beef Noodle Soup (savory with the right amount of spice and heat. Very tender beef chuck roast stew meat, some kind of noodle, veggies).

Unfortunately, no diaper changing table in the women's restroom (and none at the McDonalds and the gas station that share the same strip mall  complex). They do have one high chair to use.

Value for the money, decent portion sizes. We had plenty of leftovers from our 5 dishes. Cash Only. Their simply divine house tea is very fragrant jasmine.

Not easy to see from the street - turn on your Google Maps. It's in the middle of nowhere in Pleasanton. But definitely worth the drive if you love or miss eating great Taiwanese Comfort Food.< /review>

Nice park for family events and kids play area. Good for scenic views. Lots of Ducks seen around. Long trail available for a good walk🚶 or biking 🚴‍♀️. Nice view of the mountain and lake from the park. Also, place available for party with friends and family. Lot of parking space available as well. A good park to visit around the Fremont and Newark area.</review>

<Text>The best park visited by me in the bay area is the central park of Fremont.  Lake Elizabeth in the middle of the park along with the mountainous background is very beautiful to behold.  There are long, paved walks along the entirety of the lake.  There are restrooms situated right in the middle of the park and therefore easily accessible from anywhere.  Plenty of ducks both on the park and in the lake make for very pleasant views.   The park itself is very spacious and is very suitable for evening picnics.  There is plenty of space for parking.</Text>< pics>

Hands down this park is one of the best ones in the Bayarea. Enjoy a beautiful scenic view while you watch your kids play in one of several playgrounds they have at this park.<//Review>

<name>Pranav Deshpande</name><time>1610304940596< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This is a huge park with lots of open space along side of a golf coarse and Lake Elizabeth.

There is a boathouse and multiple kids play areas. The trail around the lake is awesome. Because of the large water body there are a lot of birds. We were pleased to see a large group of Pelicans swimming in the lake.

The only issue I had was that some people did not wear masks when on the trail around the lake.

Ample parking available as there are multiple parking lots available. Overall a good place to spend some quality time with the family.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_uKrlZVs6IqPn1Wg0AdZB4yO0CFgKf2clg6X1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFPeUQCjjkgrvW20fphItVxJJDeA3nKoYyem1d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU4U4xgGNKQoTCjGrVwjaVbQbMSD1ZTtsGdl_1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVcbgw3I1hmFvy6myXi5lEA1drhU0tOSL5xeCX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPU3vi4Mj3yA3Xe2O3C5mI7fHtNsXOCWnJmbZi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLuKYBqJztJ5uvRswVyrsL63zXD5y4gFTBbE2u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420< /GmapID></record>

<text>Filled with geese, ducks, pelicans, and animal life of all sorts. The loop around is about 1.5-2 miles depending on the path. More than dozens of places to sit and eat, quite a few grills. Open spaces and shaded spaces. A giant playground and close to a small water park. Honestly this place has it all. One of my favorite parks. Can't beat the view of the mountains either!<//text>< Pics>

We celebrated our daughter's first birthday here. We had a food truck come by with permission. The park rangers were so helpful and kind and it was a gorgeous day to celebrate! It is such a huge park with so many beautiful spots to gather!</Review>

I've been going to this park since I was a kid, before we had to pay to use the picnic areas, tennis courts or soccer fields. It seems like as the years go by there's less and less free public places to enjoy a nice day with family and friends. Its truly sad. Its still a nice park to enjoy walk, but I hate to see so many places you can only enjoy if you pay for them.<//Review>

<text>One of the best park to jog & enjoy nature.
Beautiful lake as well with too many birds.

I have a pit and he gets shunned and treated badly at a lot of parks but that doesn't happen here<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI1EZc2DxisR2OKo9JCVksoU7ZMVCes8GxNa9z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420</gmap_id></record>

During my visit, I saw many Canadian geese which reminded me of home. There are also many varieties of ducks, and several feral cats lying about.

The only complaint I had was that it was rather crowded at around 3 pm on a Saturday, which is not ideal during the current pandemic.< /Text>< pictures>

Overall it's a nice place to bring the kids and go for a walk. I prefer Lake Chabot in Castro Valley over Lake Elizabeth.<//text><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

What a beautiful lake and park. a bit crowded on the Paseo side, Baseball fields, Tennis, Cricket, Softball, Soccer fields, running walking track 2mile loop around the lake, beautiful at Sunrise and Sunset with lots of birds.
2-3 play areas for kids. connects to Golf course and also has a dog park. nice to rice with kids for a easy ride.</review>

Huge park with lots of shade, perfect for a family outing in the weekend.

One full round around the lake Elizabeth will sprouts the bean in your mind, relax the muscle and soothes the lung.

Of course with boating and kids park open things would have been much better but never the less an awesome place for family time.< /review>

Great park, very large, has several large sections with plenty of area for picnic or parties. Has allot of benches and ducks. Due to it being covid play area closed. Great place for family and couples. If you like walking 2-3 miles you can around the Lake.<//Review>

Has three play grounds for children, a huge running track along the lake and plenty of picnic area. My family and children love this park.< /text>

Quite serene,  scenic and blissful location surrounded by panoramic mountain view and lush green nature.  Perfect get away for all Fremont residents to unwind themselves... Must visit spot...</Review>

It has lake Elizabeth on 1 side along with multiple soccer fields. It also has a cricket ground. A nice long walking/ cycling track and some swings for kids. It has a golf course on 1 side as well. It also has picnic areas where you could enjoy BBQ or some other cooking. I really enjoy going there for a walk and play Frisbee and soccer with my son every week.<//text></record>

This is the best community park in the Bay Area. Very spacious, plenty of walking paths. Lake Elizabeth is within the park, offering many beautiful photo spots. Plenty of parking spaces and no entry fee.</text>

What a beautiful lake and park. a bit crowded on the Paseo side, Baseball fields, Tennis, Cricket, Softball, Soccer fields, running walking track 2mile loop around the lake, beautiful at Sunrise and Sunset with lots of birds.
2-3 play areas for kids. connects to Golf course and also has a dog park. nice to rice with kids for a easy ride.</Review>

<Review>What an amazing resource for the city and community of Fremont!!  Massive community facility with so much to offer.  From picnic areas to tennis courts to baseball field to a lake Elizabeth and so much more, there's something for everybody to love here.  Many of the attractions after temporarily closed for Covid 19, however once that's over it's business as usual here.  The staff work hard to modernize, keep relevant, maintain and clean all the facilities, come visit, you won't be disappointed.< /Review>< Pics>

Great park, nice open spaces, great walking path around the lake. Very scenic. Lot of parking but sometimes runs short. In summer too much dog poop, folks are very inconsiderate when it comes to picking after their dog.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Must wear mask. Even in covid situation, it was really crowded. So getting parking may be bit tricky, we got lucky since we reached there late afternoon. The loop is really long, can expect minimum 7,000steps. But this place is really good for spending good time with friends and family, even all alone. Sunset reflection in water is really beautiful. Close to nature.<//Text><Name>purbasha< /Name>< response>

Been visiting this park since 1973. Love walking the path. My kids grew up playing on all the park equipment. Lots of fun picnics, and get togethers. Walked this morning  (1) lap around lake. What a great day for a walk.< /Review>

Very nice park. Several sections and parks.  Water nearby with a great view and a great place to relax. Of course a great place to bring the kids but because of covid19  I wouldn't suggest bringing the kids here. Nice trail to walk and all.<//review>

Awesome views of the Park. Lots of birds. Some trails are flat, some are elevated, some sunny, some shaded behind hills. There is something for every kind of hiker. Central Park trail is paved and stroller friendly.<//text>

Well, this is one of my favorite places in Bay Area, no doubt. Beautiful lake with wildlife (and poop that comes with it, of course) and Mission Peak in background. Kayaking is available in summertime, which is cool and you can also launch your own boat for some fee.
Shopping plaza is nearby, so you could ear there and go walk around the lake to burn some calories and have some excersize.
In short, it's a very nice place.<//review>

My favorite place in Fremont. There's a lot of people during the weekend. If you want to excercises or run with proper social distance I recomend you to start  early in the morning, before 9 am or after 8 pm (if you like a night run). The restrooms are available before 9 or 10 pm.< /text>

Be sure to visit the snack bar (near the docks) and feed leafy greens to the park's resident domestic goose! Responds well to "George" and "ack". Careful though, he has no concept of personal space and tends to get very close to people.<//review>

Currently under construction for the drive through, so it's dirty and I ended up with a nail in my tire. The line backs up to the stop light. They were especially nice or friendly this visit. They take your card to run it so have your wipes ready to clean your card when you get it back. Just cuz they are wearing gloves doesn't mean that the gloves haven't picked up gems from someone else's cootie filled card. 😝</Text>

Excellent family destination. We walked across Gomes' school in the neighborhood to get to Lake Elizabeth. It is a wonderful surprise in a residential neighborhood : well maintained trail all around the lake with dog lovers aplenty , blooming flora and fauna including a section that has bamboo growing, next to a Union Pacific railway line that can be an entertainment destination for train obsessed toddlers. The only reason I rate is 4 stars is because of the duck poop (and some dog poop from lazy owners) that line up the trail.<//Text>

Awesome views of the Park. Lots of birds. Some trails are flat, some are elevated, some sunny, some shaded behind hills. There is something for every kind of hiker. Central Park trail is paved and stroller friendly.< /Text>

Awesome !. May be this is the longest walking trail around a  lake in the city.  The walking  trails are kept  clean. Quite a number of  geese, coots, gulls and ducks. At dusk,  cats ( bigger in size) are running around. Parents should be wary on this, when they are bringing their kids.  ( Here also we have seen visitors feeding the birds.  This is against the instructions or  cautionary notice exhibited) Couple of shelters (reserved ones) are available. May be the authorities allot them for Partying. Visiting for the first time here. Really appreciable one!!< /text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>I would give this park five stars but there are aggressive geese and lots of geese feces at this park. A good place to walk but maybe not the best place to bring small children who are likely to pick things up off the ground. However they do have a few dedicated play structures for children that look pretty maintained. The general area of the park is where there is an excessive amount of goose feces.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>An incredible park in the heart of Fremont. Too much crowd in the park though COVID season. Better not to go to this park on Weekends, weekdays is okay I guess.<//Text>< pictures>

Beautiful park. Nice little escape in the middle of the city. Restrooms are even well maintained. It was a nice place to go for a socially distanced picnic and walk.

I Look forward to this shut down being over and letting my son play in the playgrouds!< /review>

Beautiful scenic lake around which this park is built makes the place an attraction for nature and fitness lovers. The walk around the lake is about 2+ miles and ideal for flat surface jogging or walking.</text>

<Text>Pretty lake with full bathrooms. Two large play structures for kids. Very family friendly. You can see seagulls, Canadian geese & other water fowl. Lots of water & tall grass. Takes around 25 minutes to walk around about 2 miles) a lot of the bird poop was cleaned up. You just have to watch your steps sometimes. Free parking is a huge plus. Nice during the Spring to take your family to bike, fish, or jog. There's a cute snack stand too...not sure if it's open or functioning. Also, saw a defunct Pepsi soda machine that doesn't work . Oh well. Overall very beautiful park in the heart of Fremont 🇺🇸</Text>< GmapID>

A serene and gorgeous park,
Quiet and family friendly with lots of play areas.
Equipped with barbeque grills and benches for a Sunday day out.
The ducks were adorable and it was amazingly clean.
Very safe location.
Grab a nice book or enjoy a walk in this gorgeous park.<//text>

< Review>
This is one of the best maintained public parks in Fremont. The mountains in the backdrop turns green after a rain shower and it looks beautiful. Sometimes you can see deer right across the railroad tracks if you are lucky< /Review>

<review>I love Central Park because it's peaceful, in the nice city of Fremont, which makes it a safe place to be, and you can walk around Lake Elizabeth which is quite a long walk so overall it's a very pleasant Park and you can picnic there if you want.</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Pretty lake with full bathrooms. Two large play structures for kids. Very family friendly. You can see seagulls, Canadian geese & other water fowl. Lots of water & tall grass. Takes around 25 minutes to walk around about 2 miles) a lot of the bird poop was cleaned up. You just have to watch your steps sometimes. Free parking is a huge plus. Nice during the Spring to take your family to bike, fish, or jog. There's a cute snack stand too...not sure if it's open or functioning. Also, saw a defunct Pepsi soda machine that doesn't work . Oh well. Overall very beautiful park in the heart of Fremont 🇺🇸< /review>< UserId.>

Great park to have a stroll, run, picnic or out with the kids to any of the several kids playground.  Also has a Library, water park.  Several restaurants and shops nearby.  The lake can also house small boats.  Lots of wildlife around.</text>

Awesome !. May be this is the longest walking trail around a  lake in the city.  The walking  trails are kept  clean. Quite a number of  geese, coots, gulls and ducks. At dusk,  cats ( bigger in size) are running around. Parents should be wary on this, when they are bringing their kids.  ( Here also we have seen visitors feeding the birds.  This is against the instructions or  cautionary notice exhibited) Couple of shelters (reserved ones) are available. May be the authorities allot them for Partying. Visiting for the first time here. Really appreciable one!!</review>

Pleasant, large park with lots of recreational choices: boating, water park, jogging, bird watching, picnics, relaxing, etc...  Maybe the park is too large hard to upkeep?  One star off for less than stellar greenery maintenance.< /Text>

Lake Elizabeth is Fremont's gem! The city has done so much to this place over the years. I came here as a child and loved it. As an adult, I have enjoyed bringing nieces, nephews, and now, my own children. While the progression and changes are vast, the ambience that is captured within the memories remains the same. ❤</Text>

Great place to be to enjoy the outdoor, safely with our little one. We were able to keep social distancing with other guests while our little one can run freely on the grass.< /Text>

I doubt the there is a more beautiful and experience rewarding park outside of golden gate for all ages, in many ways better due to weather alone.

<pics>None< /pics><text>I love the beautiful lake with several species of ducks. There is a small island within the lake and it looks very nice. Walking around the lake takes about 50 min~1 hour, so it's perfect for walking the dog. Also, playgrounds for kids are conveniently available inside the park.<//text><gmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420<//gmapID>< date>

<review>Lovely park with several playgrounds, a nice paved walking/running path around the "lake". Great place to take children to play. But great place for all ages.
Not a lot of shade and the lake water was quite stagnant when we were there.
Parking was very easy and not an issue during the week.<//review>< pictures>

Visited the dog park. Small off leash dog park with a three obstacle agility area.  My dog did enjoy the ramp, tunnel, and bar jump obstacles.

Size-wise the large dog area is big enough to play fetch. The area is covered in astroturf material, since grass would require water.  There are lots of tennis balls there for the dogs that like to fetch.

Some entitled owners don't pick up after their dogs.  There are some in every crowd.

Water stations are all in working order with stainless bowls in place for easy hydration.  They are located at either end of the long dimension of the big dog area. There are nice shade pavilions for dog owners to sit in the shade.< /review>

Expansive park with 4 separate Children Play Areas for kids up to 12.  Multiple tall slides as well as climbing structures.   Rubber flooring as well and multiple restroom locations.

Many shaded picnic tables and areas but not much shade over the playground.  Grounds are well kept and theres a nice long walking/ running path around the lake.  Multiple free parking lots at this park.< /Review>

<Review>Everything you could ask for in a park is here: a beautiful lake, boat ramps, picnic areas, bbq areas, walking /jogging paths, a nice community center (which can be rented for parties), & more. There is some disabled parking, but they could use a few more spots. We sometimes go there just to eat lunch, which we bring with us. Very enjoyable!</Review>< pics>

Awesome park for kids and grown ups. Multiple play structures for kids to play. The walking or running trail of 2 miles around the lake is perfect for someone to walk or run.</Text>

<text>Nice park with many distinct areas for different activities, large sports complex with soccer, baseball and cricket fields, along side paved paths for walking, with or without pets. Pretty well kept up, biggest drawback is presence of geese year round, and the associated mess they make. Goose poop is everywhere -  sports fields, paths, playgrounds. Signs are posted not to feed geese, but it's often ignored, hence they stay all year.< /text><date>1574791994481< /date><gmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420< /gmapID>< pictures>

<review>I loved Central Park! You will never believe that you are so near to the busyness of the city. There are so many great places to explore, we only managed about half of it. I would have spent more time there if it was up to me. The bird feeding are is just lovely. It was snowy while we were there but the paths are kept clear if the snow. It’s easy to get “lost” but that’s the fun of it all<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I've been coming here for the past 25 years. It has definitely become busier. The loop around the lake is about two miles. It is a pleasant, flat pathway. If you are a not expert runner like me, it makes for a nice, safe run. You won't get bored. Lots of people to see and dodge! Geese, ducks, cats, and various animals to see. In the summer, you can rent paddle boats. Folks come for parties and picnics. There are several playgrounds and open grassy areas to play sports. There are several parking lots. Restaurants and stores are just walking distance. The BART station is also about a 15 min walk. The reason I only gave three stars is because it really has gotten very busy. This can be good and bad.<//review>

I grew up in Fremont so this is a bit bias. I love the park. Well kept and diverse.draw back is that some visitors don't follow leash laws and don't pick up after themselves or their dogs. Overall, great area for family outings and clean trails for the walk around the lake.<//text>

Walking around the lake is 2 miles. I enjoy walking may times a week. Picnic areas around the  lake becomes crowded during weekends.  I have seen many aquatic  birds like Koot, Geese,  Ducks  and other wildlife like deers, raccoons, snakes , jack rabbits<//Text>

I would like to give 5 stars here, but seriously, folks  - this is our own town and lake, we should be responsible adults using this. I have seen so much pet poop here on pathways, it is disgusting. People should pick up after their pets, I thought that is the law, but it is not being followed here.
Such a beautiful and serene place.</Text>

It a big park and has the right place for everyone. Sometimes it is too crowded but I understand it... It is the place for a nice walk around the lake, a nice bike or scooter stroll, a picnic, a playground time, a nice grill, a gathering, b-day celebration, football, baseball game or just to bring your blanket and relax. There is a lake and you can walk around it and see lots of birds in and around the water. It is a great place to relax and even get your walking done.< /review>

Though this park looks great it has a stand offish vibe from the locals. It's always seems to be pack every time I go. The people on the trail most of the time are unfriendly and pretentious. That vibe is intensified when you see all the pure bred cats abandoned there. There are tons of abandoned cat making homes in the reeds. You know they aren't local strays cause you see pure bred Persian, Siamese, American short hair and more.</Review>

Great location to stroll around on a good bright day. It becomes windy in the evening even on sunny days, so definitely have an extra layer if you are not in your workout zone. It has a nice path for walking, biking and dog walking. On the water park end it has a great play area for kids. Also very important it has plenty of space for your summer barbeque parties. It is my go to place for weekend walks. Totally love this place.<//text>

I liked how they have mile markers to tell you how far you've gone. We even stopped a few times to get some exercise on sit up table, parallel bars, and the pull up bar.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< Review>
The views of Mission Peak over a calm, sometimes light fog-shrouded Lake Elizabeth is etherial. Go early morning. You also get to meet the local residents- ducks, Canada geese, coots, ground squirels. It beats a walk on any treadmill. One round around the lake is two miles. Go for it!😀< /Review>

<Review>Central Park or Lake Elizabeth as it’s alternatively known represents the city of Fremont’s pinnacle in city planning endeavors compared to the recent rampant “developer and builder led encroachment” of city scape and quality of life. Central Park has been a goto destination not only for Fremont residents but Bay Area dwellers alike - there is nothing like it in terms of expanse, facilities and variety of entertainment options. From kids play areas, walking and running trails, picnic tables, designated recreation areas, water park, senior center and rowing facilities to ample parking, its the perfect offline family entertainment destination that also keeps the spirit of Fremont alive wishing a hectic routine in our daily lives. Better digital surveillance and monitoring would keep the safety of this park intact in times to come. Surely recommended for anyone living or visiting Fremont especially in the spring, summer and fall seasons.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I live close by and always come over here to walk around Lake Elizabeth. It's a gorgeous walk along the water and the hills are in the background. Not typically too much noise. They occassionally have events here for kids and families, like I've seen them do some sort of Disney sing-along before. Several playgrounds spread around for your kids. Multiple picnic areas that you can walk up and use or you can reserve for parties. Definitely worth a visit, even if you are just wanting to walk and clear your mind.< /Review>

My family loves walking around lake Elizabeth. We’ve got a baby and 2 dogs and always do a loop of the lake. It’s a good long walk with lots of people watching and a beautiful backdrop.

There are playgrounds for kids, a dog park and lots of areas to bbq. It’s always packed on the weekends with tons of people everywhere but still enjoyable.<//Text>

Lots of people on the weekends but everyone was really nice so it's all good. Great place to walk and has a great playground with soft ground for the kids. Also the bathrooms actually have soap, that was a big plus! Been coming here since the playground was wood back in the 80's and it's still a great place to go.</review>

<Text>Best place for walking and beautiful scenery to watch. The lake with enchanting yellow flowers around and birds in the lake attract me. The squirrels loitering on both the sides of foot path and cool breeze on sunny day is simply superb and enjoyable. Ducks and other  birds are a part of entertainment to children who visit along with their parents.< /Text><userid>114489239102922442641</userid><date>1555127370807<//date>< user_name>

<Text>Excellent ground. Beautiful location and scenery from the field. Lots of groups playing soccer. Even if you don't have a group, more likely than not, you'll find one. Great place for a morning run as well. Only drawback is that it's about 3 miles from both 880 and 680 freeways.< /Text>< pictures>

Lovely place. It's huge. But it can get a little cold in the winter since it's surrounded by water. Great place for a walk, jog or to just sit there and spend some time and also a picnic. They also allow boating on specific times.<//text>

Dry and open like the Savana. Needs some landscaping to create elevation (mounds, small hills) . These features will break up the sight lines and make each picnic area feel more intimate and cozier. The lake serves as a center piece, but lacks shade and shore line features to encourage actual proximity.<//review>

One huge park around a lake. On the weekend, this place is packed but somehow you can still find parking. Everything is in working order and you won't find much dog droppings as they have two separate fenced are for that population.

The people here are very cordial and the air is crisp and clean without any hint of tobacco or marijuana. The dog park is an interesting area and you can sit and watch the dogs play or watch the owner fetching the ball for the dogs. They also have a permit use BBQ area and two open full basketball courts.</Review>

<Text>Great place for family fun outings, birthdays or just peaceful nature. Amenities include: paddle boating, multiple trails, plenty of space for barbecuing with or without permanent grill, skate park, several playgrounds, tennis, library, restrooms, plenty of geese/ wildlife, soccer fields. Reservations are required for larger groups, we had approximately 100 in our group and had plenty of space/ shade/ tables available near the sport complex. Well laid out park. Water park is there, but I've never seen it open.< /Text>< pics>

You cannot do but appreciate the beauty of this place. Amazing mountainline with Mission Peak in the background, nice water lake with ducks and other birds swimming around. Kids playing, people running, walking, and scratching and exercising, I'm soaking in the natural beauty.< /text>

< Review>
A great paved walkway around Lake Elizabeth, enough space for both walkers, runners, and bikers. Lots of areas for picnicking if you have a group of people. Also lots of green grassy areas you can sit on, beware the bird droppings! A great escape from the busyness that is typically associated with Fremont. there are multiple entrances that you can enter in, both on Stevenson as well as Paseo Padre< /Review>

Lake Elizabeth is great! It's about a 2.5 mile walk around. Lots of different exercise stations around the course. The only downside is that there is a lot of geese which means lots of poop on the sidewalk and grass.

Other things at the park:
*3 playground for kids
*waterpark (Aqua Adventure)
*skate park
*boating area
*areas for fishing
*picnic areas w/ grills (some for reservation) & bathrooms
*teen center
*senior center
*dog parks (one for big dogs and one for small dogs)
*baseball fields
*soccer fields
*basketball courts

Around the park:
*police department
*animal shelter
*golf course
*library<//review>

<Review>Plenty of room to play or party. A lot of available picnic tables and party sites to use. You can make reservations and save a spot or show up early on the weekend and snag one of the open picnic spots, make sure you get there early if it's on the weekend. Many different parks for the kids to play at, fishing, running/walking/riding. Summer time you can rent paddle boats and float around the lake.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

We came because we wanted to walk around Lake Elizabeth. It was a lovely walk and very scenic. Lots of ducks and wild geese but they never interfered with being able to enjoy our walk. There are two playgrounds in this park. One seems to be for younger kids and one for older kids. There is also a senior center on this location site. There were a lot of people in the shade of the trees and picnic area doing Tai Chi classes.<//text>

<review>Great place for kids. A really wonderful running park. I most definitely felt safe to jog and get plenty of mileage in.  The flip side, there are hundreds maybe thousands of geese and ducks. There is duck poo everywhere and the stench can get a little strong. If geese could rule the world, it would most def be at Fremont park.< /review>< Pics>

Plenty of parking all around the perimeter. Fantastic party location. BBQs are pretty big.Nice big park with so many outdoor amenities and every sports accommodation to play is so there. Right next to the lake. Trash cans are bountiful so please don't make any excuse to leave your garbage littered everywhere. Just throw it in the can. Kids and pets play here and the last thing they need is trash and trash creatures making recreational play areas a hot gross ashtray.<//review>

Fun place to hang out with friends. Lots of grassy space to run around and BBQ. It's a little unfair but I docked it 1 star for having an excessive amount of goose droppings. Not sure how Parks Dept can fix this but still an issue when you're walking around staring at the path avoiding green mines.< /review>

Park is nice, baseball fields are okay, but lack of restrooms is why it gets a lower score. The one restroom in the baseball area is actually grounds for a 1-star review, though!<//review>

Great place for kids. A really wonderful running park. I most definitely felt safe to jog and get plenty of mileage in.  The flip side, there are hundreds maybe thousands of geese and ducks. There is duck poo everywhere and the stench can get a little strong. If geese could rule the world, it would most def be at Fremont park.<//Review>

This park isn't bad. It's usually pretty busy but there is plenty of room to find your own spot. It's great for walking, thing the ball around, frisbee, etc. It's not too far from lots of food. They have events here all the time so there is usually something family oriented to do.< /review>

<Review>Parking is free so I love it. Good place for a quick run on a paved circuit round the lake. One loop is exactly 2 miles and has almost no elevation making it an easy run. There are also rides for kids, BBQ pits and plenty of area to run/ play. The views around the lake are also nice giving you a good view of the Niles mountain range.</Review>< Pictures>

There's so much open area to run around, paved pathways for riding a bike, plus a little creek with running water to dip feet in on a hot day. The playgrounds usually have at least a few kids to play with. My main complaint is the lack of shade around the playground, which makes it really hot on hot days. And, of course, if your kid likes to be barefoot, watch out for all the goose poop.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>This is a nice large park with a pretty big lake in the middle. Lot of play areas for kids, base ball court, tennis courts but what i use the most is the nice walking path around the lake.
There's even a water park that opens in summers.
Several entrances from Stevenson and Paseo Padre. Now that the BART construction in this area is over (or most of the debris is gone), this park is more accessible.< /Text>< Pictures>

The sunrise over the mountains and its reflection on the lake is sometimes astounding. Lots of birds and natural habitat. with turtles. There are paddle boats, sail boats and kayaks to rent during summer time. There is also a acqua park lot of play area.< /review>< Pics>

Everything is good about here, except one park ranger reminded me of Cartman.  "Do you deny my authority?"
"Why you sneak up on Skatepark offroading on grass and mulch killing mycelium?"
"I do what I want" quoth the ranger.

Fun place to walk,run, play ball play catch or any kind of sporting activity. It's a great place to ride a bike around the lake. I even see some people fishing there. Plenty of playgrounds of this park. I bought brought my barbecue and the Rangers had no problem with that. Unfortunately there's not a whole lot of parking here so have your party early in the morning because I'm afternoon it gets pretty full. And then you have to park and some of the parking lots that are quite a ways away. I had to park over half a mile away from where I had my barbecue. It's very busy here on a nice day.< /Review>

Family friendly parks for all to enjoy. Bird watching enjoy nature relax on the cool Green grass and lovely shade trees. And enjoyed BBQ or picnic with family and friends. Plenty of things for kids to do.  From the jungle gym,  playing on the water slide or  renting a paddle boat  and enjoying the sunshine.<//review>

Sunset views over the lake are incredible!
Great park for tne enitre family and your pets. Run, jog, walk, stroll, TaiChi, Yoga, play areas for kids of all ages. Picnic areas with Barbecue pits. Thursdays arr movies or live music during summer.

Really good place for runners to train for their 5k n 10k races. Loop around the lake is 2miles.

Has a separate skateboard park too..<//Text>

This park has a 2 mile track around the lake - a great walk or job. The lake has many birds, & offers some boating. On weekends, the park is full with picnics. There are children's areas. Parking can be touch. Overall, a nice place in Fremont for a walk or outing.<//Text>

<review>Here with my dogs. My male loves coming here, so we do. Nothing spectacular. Artificial grass and no bathroom.
However it is right next to the SPCA which is a good idea I reckon. And it's close to Lake Elizabeth.<//review><gmap_id>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420< /gmap_id><response>None<//response>< user_name>

Tons of ducks and chipmunks. Went in the afternoon and wasn't that busy. So it was a nice relaxing walk. It's 2.0 miles around the lake and there are mile markers to let you know. Kid friendly. Dog friendly. Bathrooms are disgusting tho.</Text>

Nicely maintained, parking can be limited during peak periods such as holidays. Not too happy they replaced a large section of highly useful park's grassy area with a cricket field that is very seldom used (and locked when not in use, so unavailable). Nice dog park, but no effort made to keep "bad dogs" out nor enforce the small dog only section.< /Review>

Beautiful park with lots to do for both adults and kids. Plenty of benches to sit, bbq areas, playground structures, basketball courts, wonderful view of the lake, restrooms (don't forget your own hand sanitizer) , and even a big waterpark next door if you want to get wet! It costs to visit the waterpark, so bring enough extra cash if you're looking to go. As for Central Park, if you're looking for a private event, there's a nice size space to host parties indoor. Advance reservation and payment required. I'd definitely rate this park 5/5 stars!< /review>

I loved this place n I would come here during my lunch break primarily because it was so peaceful. The lake is there, Lake Elizabeth, n also a water park n lots of playgrounds so the kids can have fun. Definately would recommend everyone to go see such a beautiful place in the middle of a city< /Review>

I used to love this park a few yrs ago and frequented it on a daily basis. Would go for a walk, relax my mind, enjoy the fresh air, loved the lake and mountain views, enjoyed listening to kids laughing and watch them play. What happened to this place? It should be renamed, " Duck Poop Dump." What an eyesore has this place become! It's so disgusting that it's hard to stay here for 10 mins. Please do what it takes to restore this place. Thank you.< /Review>

It's a sprawling park that was constructed in the 60s. There are playgrounds, activity centers, a shallow artificial lake, a boat launch, boats for rent, baseball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, a dog park, and a water park.

The new turf soccer fields, by reservation only, are spectacular. The baseball fields seem to be too, though we've never used them. There are eight grass soccer fields that don't require a reservation - they're good fields too. And the playgrounds were a real attraction when we had young children.

It's a nice place but has no organic feel to it. It feels like everything has just kind of been dropped down. But for the soccer fields that doesn't matter.</review>

Huge open park with room for so many activities. And it's big enough that you can avoid other people for parties by going to the other side of the park usually.
Has Rangers on duty to keep the park safe<//Review>

Love this place! There is so much you can do here. Couple of play areas for kids, a skate park, a beautiful lake, numerous picnic sites around the lake, a library near by, a water park etc. Its a lively place!< /review>

Nice park to be around for barbecue, picnic, jogging, hang around with friends or with your kids. Dogs are allowed. Lot of benches to sit, multiple kids play area, restrooms. The lake is pretty big & boating is there though for a fixed time.
Due to the lake there is cool breeze during the summer.
Lot of parking though they get filled up quickly during summer evenings.
Park is located right in the center of Fremont & beside the Fremont library.
Lot of geese here & often the grasses will be full of their droppings.< /review>

It would be nice if it weren't for bird poop at almost every step.

Nice play areas for kids, areas to host parties and whatnot, and a nice walk around the lake. But if it bugs you even a little bit to step in poop, you should go elsewhere.</review>

The length of one loop around the lake is a good walk but not too exhausting.  The place is clean and filled with playgrounds.  So both kids and adults can enjoy it.</text>

Being from Texas, one is used to space and plenty area to enjoy parks so it was refreshing to experience Central Park with a wonderful layout of green scenery, art - John Lennon exhibit was awesome, fountains and listening to nature rather than the loudness of Time Square. Central Park was my refuge in NYC:)< /text>

It would be nice if it weren't for bird poop at almost every step.

Nice play areas for kids, areas to host parties and whatnot, and a nice walk around the lake. But if it bugs you even a little bit to step in poop, you should go elsewhere.</text>

We took our kitties and my mom and sisters dogs walking here. The paths are nice, the area beautiful, pet friendly,  and has a kids playground. Only downside is the restrooms were scary.</Review>

The best 2 mile walking path in the east bay.
Flat, wide smooth concrete path around a lovely duck and swan filled lake.</text>

Whether you're looking for a place to fly your kite, take a run or bike ride, Fremont Central Park is a great place to go!  There are dozens of picnic areas available as well as several large play structures (recently renovated) for the kiddo's.< /text>

There are places for children to play and those areas are made of synthetic turf which is soft so that even if children fall down they won't get hurt badly.
There are arrangements for handicapps in toilets.< /Review>

There are plentiful spots for children to play, including two large jungle gyms. The lake is large with wide paths all around it, and enough trees to provide shade. There are also barbecue locations you can reserve ahead of time! A recent addition which can appeal to those of all ages is the tremendous amount of PokeStops.<//review>

Great place to take a long walk...But, staff needs to enforce dog owners to clean up after their pets and to enforce pets to be on a leash. I walk my dog.. and it's so upsetting to see the fields have dog feces...< /text>

There are places for children to play and those areas are made of synthetic turf which is soft so that even if children fall down they won't get hurt badly.
There are arrangements for handicapps in toilets.</text>

Pretty nice park. Lots of groups doing Tai Chi in the morning, barbecue in the summer, etc. Lake is 2 miles and people like to walk or jog around.

Sometimes lots of geese and consequently the ground gets littered.</Review>

Great park. Very crowded on the weekends now. I come here on the weekdays, and it's relaxing. Careful of all the duck poop. The park employees try to clean it as often as they can.<//Review>

It’s a great place for families to spend outside and walk around. Many birds, squirrels, and plants inhabit the park. It is 2.5 mile walk around the entire lake.</text>

Very nice park with several playgrounds and a water park.  Nice running trails.  Only downside is that there are a lot of geese and therefore a lot of geese poop.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>The best park all over the Bay Area. Why ? Because you children from 2 to 12 will enjoy the huge and fun playground. You can rent a boat on the lake, drop your teen at the skatepark, run  or bike all over the lake, walk your pet to the dog park, spend the day to the Aqua park and more!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>The best park in the whole Tri-City area. Plenty of open fields, and amazing play structures for kids. It is situated on Lake Elizabeth, a manmade lake filled with an abundance of Canadian Geese and Mallard Ducks. The walk around the lake is about 2.5 miles, and quite beautiful. Plenty of picnic benches scattered throughout the park. Facilities include water, toilets, boat rentals, dog park, skatepark, basketball court, and tennis court.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Very large community park with rentable pavilions that a great for partys. A 2+ mile nature trail circumventing a beautiful lake with a number of work out stations, pedal-boats, areas for fishing, and parks for the kids ensure a great time for the entire family. Also includes soccer fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, a skate park, and a water park.</Review>< Pictures>

Crowded in weekends, parking is hard to find if you get there between 10AM and 4PM. Mammoth playground is fun to bring kid and unleash their energy with. Walk on the concrete pathway or you are likely to step on goose poop.<//review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Very large community park with rentable pavilions that a great for partys. A 2+ mile nature trail circumventing a beautiful lake with a number of work out stations, pedal-boats, areas for fishing, and parks for the kids ensure a great time for the entire family. Also includes soccer fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, a skate park, and a water park.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

The best park all over the Bay Area. Why ? Because you children from 2 to 12 will enjoy the huge and fun playground. You can rent a boat on the lake, drop your teen at the skatepark, run  or bike all over the lake, walk your pet to the dog park, spend the day to the Aqua park and more!< /review>

Best park in Fremont. Lots of great playgrounds and walkways around the lake. Obviously popular, though, so it's usually crowded.<//text>

It was a lovely park though you should be prepared to dodge goose poop! It was everywhere. I felt like I was playing hopscotch on a minefield of poop.< /Review>

Central Park or Lake Elizabeth as we grew up calling it is a great palce to take the kids, to go for a walk or run, to have a birthday in one of the many picnic/bbq areas and to just have a relaxing stroll or to read a good book on one of the many benches that are around the lake.< /Text>

Great 'sidewalk' all the way around the lake. Awsome for bicycling, roller blaiding/skating, skate boarding, jogging or just strolling. Theres several play grounds for the youngsters, lots of pick-nick areas, plenty of clean public restrooms, lots of grass areas, and for the more adventurous there is a skate park thats open from dawn till dusk. Theres fishing and boat rentals, (no swimming im the lake), however there is also a water park comparable to Raging Warters. they have a gift shop, community center, youth center, and senior center, probably more.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very beautiful big park! There is Lake Elizabeth in the park, you can walk along the lake. There are two other playgrounds in the park, one is the water park, but when I went today, he seemed to be closed for business, and there was no one; the other was the forest park, but I did n’t go there. There are also several outdoor open children's play areas. There is also a golf course in the park, so pay special attention to entering certain areas and not be hit by flying balls. The other part is very large grass and green land, there are many wild animals here; there are very many water birds, and they do not seem to be afraid of humans. Here you can relax and enjoy nature, whether it is animals or plants; you can sunbathe, watch the lake, and then have a picnic. There is a specially-built barbecue area somewhere in the lake, but I did n’t see anyone using it in the past. I don't know if I can take a boat to the middle of the lake. When I went today, the visitor center (perhaps the place where the boat was rented) didn't seem to open. Because the green area of ​​this park is very very large, I hope that there will be some vendors selling food around him, otherwise I will walk for a long time and be hungry and have nothing to eat and drink 😂 I have a small shop selling snacks in the park No season will open the door 😢

非常漂亮的大公園！公園內有伊莉莎白湖，可以沿著湖走一圈。公園內另外有兩個遊樂場所 ，一個是水公園，不過我今天去的時候他 似乎暫停營業，沒有什麼人；另一個是森林公園，不過我沒有走過去。另外還有幾處戶外的 開放式兒童遊樂區。公園內還有高爾夫球場 ，進入某些區域要特別注意，不要被飛來的球打到。其他部分就是非常廣大的青草綠地 ，有許多野生動物在這裡；有非常多的水鳥，而且他們似乎並不害怕人類。在這裏可以盡情的放鬆享受大自然，無論是動物還是植物 ；可以曬太陽、看湖泊，然後一邊野餐。在湖泊的某處還有特別專門設立的烤肉區 ，但我今天過去時也沒有看到有人在用。這裡不曉得能不能夠搭船到湖中央，我今天去的時候，遊客中心(或許是租船的地方)似乎沒有開。因為這個公園綠地非常非常的大，希望他的周邊能有一些賣食物的攤販，不然走久了好餓又沒有東西可以吃可以喝😂 公園內自己有一個賣點心的小商店， 但好像在這個季節都不會開門😢<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Good place for every generation.
There are two miles of trails around the lake. You can run and walk. There are various kinds of birds in the lake and the sky. There are also several children's play areas. The protection measures are excellent. When the weather is good, many parents will bring their children to play here. .

(Translated by Google) The scenery is good, many people are running or walking here. The disadvantage is that there are many birds, so there are several roads that are full of birds.

風景不錯, 很多人在這跑步或散步, 缺點是很多鳥類, 所以有好幾段路都是滿地鳥屎<//Text>

There is space to do sports, dance and appreciate birds, for some reason there are many geese. In the morning it is possible to see the Chinese community practice their dance and culture.
There are clean bathrooms, drinking fountains, and children's games. Easy to park.

(Translated by Google) It is a park with a great view of the mountains over a large lake. There are many places where you can BBQ. The lawn is spread throughout the park, but bird feathers have fallen everywhere and I was asked to lay a leisure sheet.

大きな湖越しに山々が見え、とても眺めの良い公園です。BBQできる所が多くあります。公園全体に芝生が広がっているのですが、至る所に鳥の羽が落ちておりレジャーシートを敷くのが躊躇われました。<//review>
