<text>Massive space with extensive range of tools and equipment for use. You have to take the basic level class before using the heavy machinery in each of the areas, but overall this is quite affordable to do. Staff are very helpful and friendly and community members are of all skill levels, offering plenty of help and advice to beginners like myself.< /text>< username>

My kids have learned so many useful skills from welding, woodworking, arduino, 3d printing, etc.  It's great to have a place that they can learn to work with their hands and useful computer software.  Today they finished their level three class and came home with the awesome skateboards they made.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Terrible experience. I was lied to multiple time from the start. I thought this would be the perfect place to work on my project when I saw it on group but it was absolutely useless. First off, you don't get "full access" to the workshop as listed in the benefits on groupon. In fact, you are restricted to essentially just the 3d printer unless you're willing to fork over ~$700 per type of tool and 1-2 months of your time. Doesn't matter if you've already completed wood working classes/welding etc and have proof.

This is in addition to the already high $200 monthly auto renewing fee (most cost $50-$100) which by the way, if you don't cancel exactly 10 days before auto renewal by writing to an address that's hard to find on their site, you'll continue to be charged (according to the receptionist). Turns out this was another lie because when I pressed her to allow me to cancel auto renewal since this wasn't what I expected, I could do it before the exact 10 day mark. What insanity is this?

So, when I saw the workshop wouldn't suit my needs I thought no harm no foul, maybe it works for some people. I'll just stop the sign up process and use my groupon for something else. This is where I was lied to, once again, where she said I couldn't return my groupon for credit. This is before I had even signed up mind you. When I got home I looked this up and confirmed this was another bold faced law. I would avoid this place unless you really need all of the tools and have a business use for it that is profitable because this particular location was boreline fraudulent.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dcdeb94d78de31:0x689f1db8931967ef</gmapID>< Rate>

The Urban Workshop (UW) in beautiful Costa Mesa is an amazing taste of the future which is made available for you in the frame we call now! This amazing place is packed with every possible tool you will need to create the special "it"..  the it that used to be only dreams in your head... that used to be blurry wishes that you could do it... that used to be something that eventually you would see that yet another fantastic idea you had was in fact, in all actuality fantastic; yes someone did create it, they actually did get it to market... and now everyone in the world is using it.

Urban Workshop is the place to take your amazing dreams and make them; right now, today... yes I said now... it's like magic! Wrap up almost all the technologies created since the industrial revolution, put them under one roof and magically make them available, usable to everyone, to anyone... especially to you and to me. That's what I am talking about. You become the expert!

The action plan (put together by Steve, the owner of Urban Workshop) is an easy entry thing! You simply start off by joining as a member of the Urban Workshop for an amazingly low fee (the fee can be worked out to monthly, yearly or even longer). As an Urban Workshop member you now have potential super powers (you never knew most of which were even available)! You now  have access to all the super fantastic machines of industry, the very very special tools of craft and trade, the powerful computers and phenomenal applications; this is the space to spread your imaginary wings and fly into so much more...

To get you up and flying Urban offers quick intro lessons; once you are familiarized with the equipment, the tools, the process, you can start making your very own "Make" project. Your very own Dream project...

Oh!, no need to be intimidated by all of this technology. If you would like some support on getting up to flying speed there are a lot of experts at UW that are willing to help you. You may find a collaborator onsite...

Additionally, users can run there own small business right here on the premises... There are a couple of businesses successfully doing just that...

Storage space is available if you need it. That way you can have your supplies and special tools onsite...

A tour of Urban Workshop was given by Katelin, it was amazing, fun, informative and personal. Katelin introduced me to almost everything Urban is about and to top it off, she introduced me to Stephen (the owner). He was very helpful, easy to talk with despite he has so much of the Urban Workshop buzzing all around...

I had a fun time at Urban Workshop. I hope to join soon...

<text>Great folks, amazing selection of tools, and a bit of a polish I haven't seen on many Makerspaces. Very reasonable fees, comparable to my home Makerspace back in VA, which was surprising given the SoCal cost of living in comparison. Super helpful staff, incredibly well organized, and loads of classes available to expand your horizons, and sharpen skills.<//text>< user_id>

In my experience and searching, this is a totally unique facility where inventors, small businesses and even startups can use industrial equipment and industrial grade software to "Make Awesome Stuff  !"
Yes, STEM classes for kids are taught there too !
Like a coworking incubator, but with REAL INDUSTRIAL GRADE EQUIPMENT as well as all the benefits of a brilliant coworking culture.</text>

Amazing place and people! Take a tour and see for yourself. Make cool custom gifts for your friends, family and aquaintances instead of $20 chocolates, flowers and trinkets. It'll cost you a fraction of the cost and make your membership money back. Wood shop, metal shop, CNC, commercial 3d printer, last cutter and engraver, vinyl cutter, etc. The best part is learning so much from the community there that would take you years to learn in your own. That's gold! You get a discount at local stores and there's some scraps to experiment on.</Review>

The energy surrounding the place is infectious, and you'll want to keep making new projects or using new machines. Engineers and Startup businesses are frequent residents, so are small independent business owners who make and sell their custom creations. Great place to meet, greet, and network — everyone here is super friendly.

This place is awesome! They have every kind of production machine you can think of from laser cutters, 3D printers, injection molding, CNC routing and so much more. They also offer classes if you want to learn more about the equipment or learn about the different design software that is necessary.<//Text>

Urban Workshop is one of the best places to get access to industry-grade tools and systems for commercial or personal use.

Paying for a membership to Urban Workshop gives you access to a wide variety of tools and classes for you to choose from.  Machines such as Laser Engravers, Mig Welding Torches, CNC, and various others are available to you upon completing a single safety class to become familiar with the machine (the only exception to this is the CNC machine, which requires a few more classes due to its complexity).

I would strongly recommend checking out Urban Workshop if you or your child are interested in learning more about the manufacturing process.</Review>

<Text>If you are looking to use urban workshop to make a living i suggest you move on.  They do not like ambitious people there. The only people who are making money there are Steven and his buddy Troy. All they care about is class sales. You have to reserve time on a schedule to get 2 hours a week of CNC machine time. As i write this review the one and only CNC machine in the shop has been down for 5 days now. Parts ordered from china without expedite so minimum 10 days to arrive.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1518381638378, 'text': "Hi Jim,\n\nI am sorry to hear your experience with Urban Workshop did not work out the way you had hoped. We are set up as a prototyping and hobby shop so by design we are not setup for production. We have to be considerate of all of our members (over 1350 currently) who pay for and expect the same access to machinery. The access policy is not exactly as you described. Members can make reservations for 2 hour blocks on any piece of equipment and if no is waiting they can continue to use it all day long or until someone else requests access or has another reservation period.\nThe sign off classes are necessary to prevent injuries and minimize improper use of the equipment. Our desire is to allow people to get to work in the shop as quickly as possible without tying them up in classes. Most of our classes (all of them except for the CNC's) are one-time classes for no more then three hours. Students are then signed off for life. We believe this to be a very fair and reasonable arrangement that allows members to learn how the equipment operates, our community expectations, and increase safety. Please keep in mind we do need to cover teacher and material costs for classes and that on average our class prices hover around $80 per student. We believe this to be very fair for the instruction and safety it provides. The cost of other local training options are much more expensive and longer in duration, for example community colleges provide semester long programs that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.\nWith regard to the CNC router being down this week. It is unfortunate but it happens and we are sorry if it impacted you in a negative way. We have hundreds of members of varying skill levels using all of the machines and sometimes they accidentally break things. We also have hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment in the facility and for a small business it is impossible to stock every possible replacement part. We ordered a replacement CNC router head within 3 hours after the failure and unfortunately it is shipping from overseas. If we could get it locally we would have, but it is simply outside of our control. In this case, since the machine is one of the more popular items in the shop we will stock a spare milling head in the future to minimize member impact.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced and welcome you try us again in the future when you have another project to complete."}</resp>

<review>This place is dishonest and overpriced. They HIGHLY filter Yelp Reviews first of all. Second, for the amount of money they charge to use equipment, one can easily buy their own. Urban workshop tries to gouge customers by making them take unnecessary safety courses. I'm OSHA certified and a skilled tradesman but they want you to pay for their safety courses. Lastly, none of their instructors have any real experience. Go to a local community college. You can have access to the same equipment for less nonsense, a better price, and a more experienced person to teach you. Urban Workshop is trash and their phone staff are rude as well.</review></record>

<text>This is the largest makerspace in the area.  Full woodshop with a Laguna 4x8 CNC Router, a metal shop with a manual Bridgeport and lathe, MIG and TIG welders and a Haas CNC mill, 2 Epilog Lasers (40 and 50 watt systems), a vacuum thermoformer, several auto lifts, professional ABS 3D printer (significantly higher quality than the little desktop 3d printers), 24" Roland vinyl cutter; computer lab with 4 stations loaded with solidworks, fusion 360, photoshop, illustrator, Corel draw and a whole lot more.  They offer classes for each piece of equipment you want to use.< /text><Date>1469386464758< /Date><name>Steve Choo<//name>< pics>

<review>It was truly a  five-star experience as Nate,  the owner of the business, had to perform all aspects of preparing and executing paperwork for the sale of a used car on his lot. There were no other employees present that day so he filled the roles of both salesman and secretary. He performed those roles with enthusiasm and good humor after he had monitored my test drive, during which he described the special qualities of the vehicle. I was pretty sure I wanted the vehicle after driving only a few feet. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it took so long--past experiences at purchasing a car seemed endless, as well--heightened by the fact that he had to answer questions from others in the office as well as on the telephone. Even so, it was a pleasant experience and I know I will enjoy owning the car he sold me!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This auto dealer is a breath of fresh air compared to purchasing from most used car/truck dealerships. They have the gifted style of asking questions of what your are looking for and then trying rob match you with what you want.
Our drive of 55 miles to their location was well worth the drive. We purchased an SUV, definitely worth the value we paid and we left with an excellent purchasing experience plus 2 new friends. We will return when we need another auto purchase. Good job Nate and Steven.<//Text>

I had an amazing experience with Nate! I got the vehicle I wanted at the price I wanted. Great service, easy peasy!! This is a local family owned business worth supporting! I will go back for sure and continue to refer people. If he doesn't have what you want on the lot he will find it for you!!!</text>

Nate was exceedingly helpful.  Answering all questions patiently.  Continuing to reassure, with backup documentation, that the Dodge 2500 Ram truck that we bought was in exceptional condition... verified by Car-Fax, and a local diesel mechanic.  We are elated with the very fairly priced purchase.< /Text>

Deruelle’s Auto Sales helped me find the exact car I was looking for and walked me through the process step by step. If you are looking for a specific car and it is not on the lot... they will try to find it for you within your budget! Great service, awesome people, and reliable cars! Thank you!!! I’m sure I’ll be back! ;)< /review>< pictures>

We decided to take a little trip to Shingle Springs in search of a roadster we had seen online. I'm sure glad we did! We found the perfect car for the perfect price. Mr. Deruelle was knowledgeable, friendly, and honest. He answered all our questions and made us feel very comfortable with our purchase. Thanks!<//Review>

<Text>I just test drove a 4Runner and I wanted to put a review just to say that the experience was great. Even though I decided it wasn’t the right car for me, I didn’t feel any pressure from them (even though it’s late in the day and really cold out), and Nate even asked what specifically I’m looking for so he can keep an eye out for the right 4Runner. Seem like good, decent people.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1612918079251, 'text': 'This review made our day! It was a pleasure meeting you and we hope to do business one day!

After looking around on the internet I was surprised to find the best deal right here in my local area up the hill.  It seemed that many of their used vehicles were of high quality and knowing that Nate has the service repair background I felt confident that he knows which used cars are best. And he helped with the finance to get the job done.  I would definitely buy from  Deruelle's again.< /Text>

<text>I have bought for or five cars (honestly at this point I have lost count) from Deruelle's the service has always been excellent!  I would and have recommended them to anyone who needs a car, if they don't have the car you want at the price you want chances are pretty high they can find it for you.</text>< Pics>

<Review>My elderly uncle sold his car here today.  Steve was wonderful to work with.  It was refreshing to deal with a kind and non-pushy salesperson.  Steve was very honest,  caring, and forthcoming.  We very much appreciated his integrity, and would highly recommend this local business to those wanting to sell or purchase a vehicle< /Review><Date>1535632846862< /Date>< Name>

Listen everyone... Nate and Sierra are amazing. They know how to treat customers and they truly have your best interest in mind. They make the process simple, and work with your budget 100% to their best ability. We have never had a better car buying experience. If you see a negative review about Deruelles, well that individual is sadly mistaken because these folks want you to drive away happy. If you don't want to be frustrated about the car buying process, do yourself a favor and go here first.</Text>

If you're looking for an easy, no-pressure car shopping experience, I would definitely recommend talking to Nate and Sierra at Deruelle's. They gave us a crazy good deal and really took care of us.  Their honesty and integrity is apparent in how they run their business and it's such a different experience than any other car purchasing experience I've had before. No back and forth games, just good deals.  Love the year of oil changes included also!!  Thank you Deruelles!< /Review>

Not only did we acquire 3 awesome cars from here, we also acquired some new friends. Bottom line: these are the kind of people you want to buy your car from... they won't do you wrong!

I can't say enough about the service at Deruelle's Auto Sales. They found the exact car I was looking for at a great price and sold my old vehicle. Nathanael is extremely professional and incredibly competent. I would highly recommend them if you are buying and/or selling your vehicle.< /Text>

Deurrell's Auto Sales family-friendly very thorough . They work hard to get you the best deal to get you approved if you need it, and their follow-up is phenomenal. They build relationships that Last. You'll never need to go anywhere else to to purchase or to repair a vehicle again.</review>

So far he has fixed: ~20 years of cracking noises on my neck and recurring upper back pain from old herniated disk. Past three years, saw an ortho for upper back and neuro for sciatica, received prescriptions supplemented with 4 months of PT.

~4-5 months with Benson Chiropractic no pain anywhere, no more cracking and no sciatica, all without prescriptions and I FEEL GOOD after every appointment, No Brainer! Great place, he’s thorough, staff is pleasant, courteous and EXTREMELY accommodating. Definitely a satisfied customer/patient.< /text>

I have the privilege of having many fine doctors here in San Francisco.  About 5 weeks ago I started seeing Doctor Benson Tam for issues with my back.  I have definitely added him to the list of fine doctors here in the Bay Area.  Dr. Benson is very thorough and makes sure that you understand everything that he is explaining about your condition.  On my regular visits to his office he continues to be very solicitous, ensuring that I am doing ok.  His "bedside" manners are impeccable.  I am very fortunate to have him as a doctor.  I highly recommend his services.  You will also find his office staff to be equally warm and friendly and easy to communicate with.</Review>

I am not one for leaving reviews, but I have to say that Dr. Tam is one of the most attentive chiropractors I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen quite a few. My pain has decreased significantly and I’ve learned a lot about how to minimize my neck and back pain and improve my overall posture. I recommend others to give him a try, especially if you’ve never seen a chiropractor before.</Text>

< Review>
I had a knee dislocation back in October of last year and was desperately searching for reliable doctors and physical therapists. I finally met Dr. Tam and I am so grateful that I did. After a couple of visits and treatment, I gained back most of my strength on my injured knee and saw significant improvement. I was able to walk without limping or wearing a brace shortly after. Dr. Tam is very understanding, skillful, and patient with my progress and recovery. I can‘t thank him and his staff enough for their generous help and care!</Review>

I had a HORRIBLE experience; from the time I first called until I walked out of the door I dealt with slow and unknowledgeable employees. Mercedes was not able to answer any of my questions on the phone, not even pricing. She assured me that I would get an x-ray and there would be no problems if I scheduled an appointment, so I went ahead and scheduled the appointment. The front desk clerks seemed illiterate and unskilled. After waiting FORTY FIVE MINUTES after my scheduled appointment and filling out unneeded and intrusive paperwork, Dr. Tam came in rudely and said that they actually cannot complete a simple x-ray. Horrible experience, slow and inexperienced staff. Unhelpful, not kind, and not understanding doctor. I am still looking for assistance! Shameful.<//review>
<response>{'time': 1611373885502, 'text': 'Sorry you feel this way.  As I explained to you at the office, I can not just take a “simple” X-Ray of patients without evaluating them first.  It is standard of care to evaluate before xrays are taken at my office. I hope you find a place to take the Xrays for you.  Wishing you the best.'}<//response>< Date>

I went to Dr. Benson Tam seeking treatment for injuries I suffer from a fall in Golden Gate Park.  I had pain on my neck, both elbows and left knee and was not able to do my usual activities.  After I received treatments from Dr. Benson Tam all pain was eliminated and I was able to resume my usual activities.</Text>

He was good in educating me on my problems with my neck and how to properly conduct neck exercises and ice treatments. Military friendly and very professional. Highly recommend!!</review></record>

<text>When I first found Dr. Tam on Yelp,  was in really bad shape with lower back pain, upper back pain, knotted back muscles, and my right shoulder was lower than the left. After 2+ months of treatment I am slowly getting back to normal and doing so much better. Thanks to Dr. Tam, I am now always mindful of my posture when sitting at my desk all day, and I am not slouching anymore. I like the fact that he used to be an athlete. He has helped me out with some ankle issues and offered to help with any other sports related injury.< /text><Response>None< /Response><Name>Rocky Butani</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had back pain from doing labor work (construction), so I decided to find a doctor who can help alleviate my problem. So, I decided to see Dr. Tam for a treatment. After his treatment, I am surprised to say that he was able to do the trick. Dr. Tam is very intelligent and knowledgeable in his field of work (Chiropractic). In addition, he seems to be a very kind person who respects all of his clients. Dr. Tam is one of the best chiropractors that I have ever met.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

I've been Dr. Tam's patient since April 2014.  I began visiting him because of pain in my foot, which was relieved after treatment.  I now visit him every few weeks for adjustments and treatment for various sports-related pain.  Dr. Tam is the best.  He is friendly, patient, and skilled.  His office staff is friendly and it is very easy to make an appointment. I enthusiastically recommend Dr. Tam to anyone who needs chiropractic services.</Text>

< Review>
Dr. Tam is loaded with expert chiropractic experience in helping my back and elbow injury to recover quickly.  He treated my pain with pinpoint accuracy, and I am so blessed to find him on the net for the treatment.  I am extremely pleased with his treatment and service.
His service fee is more than fair and generous for the excellent service he provides.
He get an A+ from my rating.
When you are in-need of a chiropractic treatment, he is the Doctor you should be looking for.

Thank you Dr. Tam.< /Review>

Great Chiropractic for me. The most important thing — "It works!" Dr. Benson Tam has cured my frozen shoulder problems. I have the frozen shoulder problems for years, and have seem many doctors with many different treatments. It was Dr. Benson Tam finally fixed my frozen problem 100% without any drugs. His magic fingers treatment works!< /Text>

<review>I'm 82 and have collapsed lumbar discs, plus a bit of scoliosis.
Benson Chiropratic, Dr. Tam, has given me the steps and treatment necessary so that I am no  longer leaning forward and I can also manage the pain.  I go to the clinic frequently for reasonably priced appointments, and will continue to stay in the care of this clinic. Most days I'm pain free now.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I was referred to Doctor Benson Tam for treatment due to a car accident. I suffered from consistent back pain and neck pain to the point that it disrupted my sleep and daily performance. Thanks to Doctor Tam, I am  now back to normal and feeling great again.<//text>

<review>I have been struggling with a multitude of issues over the last few years such as arthritis, tendonitis, and structural problems. Dr.Tam has been helping me overcome these issues and I have seen so much relief. I know that I am on a sure track to being 100%. I highly recommend seeing Dr.Tam for any and all issues you might have.<//review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

My right ear was blocked with allergies for a year. I was having dizzy spells and vertigo My regular doctor put me on nasal steroids for a year with limited results.  He was referring me to an ENT specialist who said my eustachian tube was probably going to have to stint put in to relieve the pressure.  I felt there was something else wrong.

Searching the Internet I found Dr Tam's website. I called him to see if he could help.  He took me in for an exam and xray and found my neck vertebrae were misaligned and my shoulder had some issues.  After the first treatment, I noticed better results than with any doctor before.  After a few more treatments the dizziness and vertigo were gone and I was feeling a lot better. I was also off my allergy meds and nasal steroids. I still see Dr Tam for adjustments but my condition has improved tremendously. He was very helpful, extremely knowledgable, and helped me to understand my condition and how to correct the problem.  To anyone with hearing problems, or dizziness, don't disregard chiropractic care. If you are in San Francisco or surrounding areas, I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Tam.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Wanted to support a local place to eat last night. My 8 year old son loves Jim’s Pizza more then anything. Ordered online and almost immediately received a call from a sweet lady saying they were swamped (due to all the madness going around). She said it might be 2.5 hours before we would get it delivered. No big deal to us since pizza and the people who work there are awesome!!!! Ended up getting our delicious order in about an hour and they even gave us a free extra speciality pizza!!! Jim’s Pizza will be the only place I go in McKinney for pizza from now on!! You guys rock!!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I eat here a lot since I work nearby. I have to say their service is always great and they keep the place well organized constantly. Prices are reasonable and they serve large portions.<//Review>

The food was good and came for a great price. The staff is super friendly, not just with me, but with every customer I saw come in. It's a great, friendly environment. The location is in a convenient shopping center, and most people took their food to go (or had it delivered), so there was plenty of seating, indoors and out, that I wouldn't be worried about finding a table. The toppings choices were plentiful, more than certain pizza shops, and they were tasty. We only ordered pizza, but there was tons of other stuff available on the menu as well.< /text>

This is my favorite pizza of all time, I've been coming here my whole life and LOVE it.  One slice (which is actually 2 in size). Is only $4.50 and it's only 50¢ a topping.  They also have draft beer which is unique for a pizza place.</text>

Don't get me wrong, the pizzas are good but it won't impress those looking for 'atmosphere'... and really... that is what makes this place super special to me.  This is a pie to take home and share with your friends or family while watching a cool movie on Netflix! Don't miss this little gem tucked in near the Blithedale Whole Foods when you want to chow down on a real AMERICAN pizza.< /text>< Pics>

Tonight we ordered a large, half pepperoni, half sausage pizza and a side of blue cheese.  We got a COLD sausage and ham with no blue cheese side.  For $23.  We are a 2-3 minute drive from the restaurant.

Previously we ordered wings that arrived cold and undercooked.

Please be careful if ordering from here.  The Pizza is serviceable/good, fine for pickup. but the delivery is probably miss or miss.< /Text>

I'm so sick of restaurants in the area charging so much for their bad food and poor service, simply because they're in a nice neighborhood!

<Text>Longer than expected wait for take out pizza that was ordered in advance. Ordered online and got there 20 min later to pick up and they said...oh, we just got your order and put it in the oven. Really? Price is ok relative to Marin County. The pizza is "ok" but nothing remotely close to memorable. Overall a disappointment. And the price for extras on the pizza? Ridiculous!< /Text>< GmapID>

Average tasting pizza , predictably Mill Valley priced = hilariously overpriced, dated décor, plenty of parking, and fairly friendly and helpful staff.  All totaled, equals a medium score.</review>

<Text>Great NY style slices. Order the "one" slice and you really get two large slices and a drink for $4.50. Can't be beat - it's the Mill Valley equivalent of SF's Arinells (sorry, not even close to Arinell's but it's all in context right?).

I had them deliver to a park for a kids party and they were exactly, I mean exactly on time... consider the delivery spot on and the pizza arrived nice and warm. This is a great kid's place but adults should like it too + it beats Stefano's rubbery cold slices.<//Text>< Pictures>

This place is amazing!!! I am a new dog owner and low on funds so I called Concord Feed Pet and livestock I was able to get my dog's shots the same food he loves for $10 cheaper! He likes Blue Wilderness Taste of the Wild! I was also able to get my dog wormed by buying some simple powder wormer and wet food, also a big shout out to Brian!!! He was the one who answered the phone, got what I wanted/needed and put it at the front counter with my name on it! He also explained to me and my husband over the phone which shots to buy and how many for our specific dogs weight and breed! I am proud to say that my puppy is almost 5 months now and we are just now scheduling our FIRST Veterinary appointment because of Brian at Concord feed pet & livestock I didn't have to go to the vet until his 6 months appointment!!!! Wow I have just saved literally thousands of dollars!!!!!!!!! my puppy hasn't seen the inside of a Veterinary Clinic and won't have to now until his 6 month appointment! Thank you Brian and everyone at Concord feed pet & livestock! You really saved our puppy and my wallet! Thank you again!</text>

<Review>This place used to be amazing but since they sold to Concord it’s been not so great. Trying to get chicks has been a mess and the last straw for us. Called five times, talked to multiple people, and showed up in person twice. Shipments delayed which is totally understandable and out of their control-but in all six of these interactions no one mentioned they were keeping a list of people interested in chicks. Chicks finally arrived and we called to confirm, showed up, and were asked if we were on the list? How was this never mentioned? They say we have to have gotten on the list yesterday...but we were physically there yesterday and no list was mentioned. Employees don’t seem to know what’s going on and the manager was extremely rude responding to questions. My family has used this store for over 20 years and it’s just sad seeing how management has gone down hill. Not to even mention the employees weren’t wearing masks in the back.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Concord Feed is the best place in Livermore for all your livestock and pet needs. We use them almost exclusively for our Boer Goat business, buying feed by the pallet. The staff here is top notch, very knowledgable and just plain friendly.< /review>

As I had been to Concord feed in Dublin and had been there a few times and it was excellent then I believed that Concord Feed in Livermore would be just as great---- and it was. I got the service and products that I wanted and needed. It is a well-stocked store. I recommend them.<//Review>< Pictures>

Always a great selection whether for your pet dog/cat or larger, rancher-scale needs.   Prices are competitive and it is good to support local businesses. They are always available to load my vehicle whether a bag of kibble, bales of hay,, or whatever else I need. It's also great to get their advice on products - I find that they are always truthful and genuinely try to help me get what's best for my pets. Have been going there for years and will continue to do so.</Text>

I've been coming here for many years for  pet and feed supplies, and I have yet to find a better store. They have a great supply of food for all sorts of animals and a friendly staff who are always happy to help you load your vehicle.</Text>

A bit pricey on items sourced from outside but the local feed are priced very well. There are hey bales and feeds for larger farm animals. My first impression is very similar to Petco or PetExtreme but more of a local feel and snaller variety.<//text>

<text>November 19, 2020 I was involved in an accident with a drunk driver. This accident resulted in my new 2020 Honda Accord Sport being totaled out. I was referred to a “law group” by relatives and they were terrible, later (November 25th) I was then referred to Pirnia Law Group (specifically Seth D.) from a close friend he gave me a call the same day , we spoke for about 20-30 minutes and I already knew I was making the right decision in choosing Seth and Pirnia to represent me and ensure that my case was handled in the best way possible. I called Seth on CHRISTMAS DAY and he picked up the phone and spoke to me , professional, politely , and with concern as always. Ensuring that all my questions and concerns were addressed and everything was understood every step of the way. Seth was able to get my case settled out by the middle/end of February 2021 with the maximum settlement amount. This was the BEST experience with a law group. I would tell anyone who is considering this law group to look no further you’re right where you need to be. God forbid any future tragedies, but in the event this law group would absolutely be the first I would call.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwadDdEYCgJ0ErMuvGHYV3FhNeRJZf-O30AyXd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyzD2K7eowTHLMyXMtQm_py-6tmSJAfIR27_MZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnCN6PS_1TCV_yWrXB9D4Pj8LizQac2ScJWqKE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6n_y1KuAmxtbB_OUSwgWAlqlFB0w4P684DWYm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRrVnHny8heMLY5Q_UEGc0tG9E3giL6jLy8Ox_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrUonLodISFKF0U-7V9BL-2cDJ1e5eag5x71hX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9qVErEcKbXKBSLpWY57BeYTAVKMwdFmp8N4rx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

It was amazing to have Pirnia Law Group as my my representation for an accident I had last year. Shout to Asa! Thank you for always answering all my questions, making everything as smooth as possible, and for being HONEST! Yeah who would’ve thought lawyers were honest, lol, but was great help during these hard times! Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for an attorney.</text>

<Review>Last August I was involved in an car accident. My friends advised me Pirnia Law Group. I worked with attorney Brankica and she did a really great job. She is professional, responsive and caring and negotiated a settlement I was very happy about. I highly recommend Brankica and Pirnia Law Group to people in need of personal injury attorney.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2b94f7066d049:0x7c44d9cb7139c17d< /GmapID></record>

One of the most amazing experiences after such an ugly accident. Seth and Alli really took care of me. They took me through process step-by-step and were very thorough. Honestly, At first I was very nervous to seek help but as soon as I met them in person, I was greeted with such great positive energy and with the sense that I was in good hands. If I needed something answered or quick advice, Seth and Alli were very responsive in call backs. They updated me along the way, which was nice because I tend to get anxious.

I 100% recommend you call them this instant and get started on your case today.< /Review>

Words cannot express how thankful I am with Pirinia Law Group as they are a very strong ethical company.  I owe my quick 2 month long settlement process to the hard, efficient, and dedicated work of Hugo and Brandon. They made this very stressful  process so easy as they took  care of everything from my car getting repaired to the different Dr's appointments I needed. Hugo takes your worries away from the moment you contact him.  He works hard to close cases asap. He has assisted my family in 3 different occasions and has always been as professional. I highly recommend Hugo as the agent to assist you with your case.< /text>

< Review>
I was referred to Seth from Pirnia Law Group by a close friend, and I'm so grateful I was! My car accident left me feeling awful, but in turn, my experience with this firm was amazing. I was rear ended back in Jan 2020, and my case has already been settled. Seth was so professional and remained extremely responsive throughout the whole process. Seth always made sure I was kept up to date with everything, and made the time to follow up with me so I was never left with any questions or feelings of uneasiness. Seth did his best work and as a result got me the maximum settlement. I'm highly satisfied with the outcome, but what I appreciate the most from my experience is that I always felt valued and cared for. Thank you Seth! Keep up the great work :)<//Review>

The folks at Pirnia Law Group - especially Seth - are the epitome of great customer service. Seth went above and beyond to make sure that my all my needs and medical bills were taken care of. He was extremely responsive and I felt very safe having him represent me. Hopefully I won't ever need to seek out more services, but if I do, I will definitely be returning to Pirnia Law Group. Thank you again Seth, I appreciate you so much!< /text>

I’m so thankful for Pirnia law group!!! I didn’t know what to do when I was hit back in may 2020. The person lied and claimed I was at fault, Pirnia stepped in and took care of everything! They were very professional. Always kept me informed and on top of things from appointment reminders to something as simple as scheduling me an open mri because he wouldn’t want me to feel uncomfortable. Every single person that worked with me through out all this was absolutely amazing! Thank you all so very much<//review>

<Review>By far the best experience I have ever had with any law firm. I first started with them in late 2019 when I was involved in a horrific accident, during this time I had a pending case with another law firm that was taking forever to contact me and give me more information about settling the case. Asa Yashar from pirnia picked up the old case and settled it within a week and a half.

Moving forward with the new case they were rockstars. Every question I had asa was answering right away , my doctor appointments were fantastic and made me feel welcomed and not just another client. With that being said the law group made me family, I would call at random times of the day and week with every call being answered. I would 1000 percent recommend this group to anyone and everyone who is involved in an accident and is looking for the right law firm. If your looking for a group that treats you like family and not just another paycheck you found them.<//Review><username>Oscar Moya<//username>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I’m so happy my friend referred me to Seth, from Pirnia Law group. I was involved in a car accident last year where I collided with an uninsured motorist. My barely 1 month old car was deemed a total loss by my insurance company. Although I have full coverage, I thought it would be best I get a lawyer since the other driver was uninsured I needed to hire someone that would defend me from my own insurance. My insurance wanted to put the blame of the accident on me since it would be easier for them to raise my rate rather than collect money from the other motorist who couldn’t afford to be insured in the first place. Seth worked really hard for me over this last year, to make sure my insurance took care of their own client. Seth was also very attentive and was constantly contacting me to make sure I was doing okay, and to see if I needed anything. If I ever had a question or concern he was always very quick to respond. Here we are almost a year later and my case has settled, I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome. Thank you Seth for all that you did for me, I will 100% recommend you to anyone needing a lawyer, and should I find myself in this situation again you will be my first phone call.

<Review>In March 2020 I got t-boned by a driver who ran a red light. Thankfully my sister referred me to Seth and Ardy, otherwise I would have literally settled for less. My car was totaled and the insurance paid out on that. But Seth helped me get chiropractor visits, x-rays, MRI’s, and etc... months later I was pain free. My settlement has just went through, and now I have additional money coming in which really helps. What the insurance would have just given me on my own was not enough to recover from an accident that I had 0 liability for. I’m so grateful for all the hard work Pirnia Law Group put in for me. Seth was always a phone call or text away, and had good communication with me during the process!</Review>< pictures>

I am so grateful to have Artie and his team follow my case all the way till the end with great success. They have looked out for me and my two sons in more ways than one. I was in an accident on January 2, 2018 and every month since then not only did he handle my case for a reasonable amount but he also made sure that my family did not need for anything the entire time. This was extremely troublesome during Covid but not one time did he let my family go without. And that assistance covert financial as well as information, and basic needs. He and his team put forth all of the extensive legwork that I would've not been able to do myself saw that I got proper medical treatment including surgery and make sure everything was paid for. This is a group of highly class individuals who are not just experts but very may well be professors in their profession. I received a settlement after three years that was not only litigated extremely well by their team but paid out more than fair. I recommend The Parina law Group to everyone!!! Special thanks to Ardy Pirnia, Conrad Salumbides, and Asa YAshar</review>

My experience with Pirnia Law Group was great! It was a pleasure working with Hugo Hernandez. I was involved in a car accident a few months back and Hugo was on the case since the first day making sure I was well taken care of. He followed up with me to know how the process was going and how my doctor visits were going as well. Any questions/concerns I had Hugo was there to explain it thoroughly. I highly recommend this law firm group. Very effective and very punctual and professional a definitely 5 star grade for them on my behalf.< /review>

I can now say that choosing them to represent me was one of the best decisions  i have ever made in my life. Their attention to detail and professionalism was everything. Seth really went above and beyond to help me. Whenever I had a question he took the time to help me out. Talking to Seth over the phone made me feel like I had known him for years and he made me feel like I was part of the family. He made me feel at ease and made sure I recovered back to 100%, I feel 10x better then i ever did. I just want to thank Seth and Uncle Ardy. I will definitely be recommending them to all my friends and family.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Hi I’m writing this because I had seen a one star review and I wanted to share my experience to help others im really grateful they were able to get me a bit help and get my check but it was all pretty stressful because I was left carless and with no job and I let them know that .. the first time we met they let me know to not worry that they were going to get me to the chiropractor , they only got me an uber one time and raul told me that they couldn’t get me any more ubers because I had already gotten one .i was pretty sad about that but Luckily my boyfriends mom wasn’t working at the time and was so nice enough to take me for about 3 months . They stopped calling at one point So I called and they let me know raul was not working on my case anymore and they a signed me to someone else pretty grateful this is all over thank you for all your help still grateful<//text>

A friend of mine recommended me to this firm when I got into a car accident. I had no idea what I was doing, I wasn’t sure about what steps I should take, but I decided to go through with it. I was represented by Aiden. Aiden took charge of my case and left me with little to worry or stress about. He answered all my questions and concerns promptly as he also handled my case. He went full force for me and got me my full treatment & settlement. I definitely recommend Aiden to anyone who has a similar case. He is responsive, professional, and definitely takes initiative in going the extra mile to get what you deserve and what is right.</Text>

<review>UPDATE:
I now understand the reviews of claiming this business is a scam. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THEIR APPARENT KINDNESS, IT IS A TACTIC TO PULL YOU IN. Overall, this group seems to be concerned with milking injured patients for as much monetary gain as possible, rather than helping the client get the care they need to feel better.

Unfortunately, I had to replace my 5-star review with a 1-star because they randomly dropped my mom’s slip and fall case at Costco, with absolutely no explanation. She has gone to over a month of physical therapy and is now left with that bill, along with the bills from the different doctors they sent her to. They tried to force her to do procedures she was not comfortable with so they could gain a greater compensation at the end. Ultimately, I believe they were upset she had a strong case but wanted to take the holistic approach to healing. Rather than going for the suggested surgeries and procedures with many different, negative side effects.

Before that, they apparently changed Raul’s position and did not tell us. Raul also promised to contact me back with an explanation and failed to do so. Raul is my friend and it hurts me to write this review but I am giving my honest opinion based off the facts and my experience. Future clients should be aware of this group’s ability to change attitudes with no regard for the clients wellbeing.

This whole “law group” seems a bit shady. We were never able to meet or speak with the lawyer, only these guys who recruit customers and cases. They have different addresses on their card and online and when you look it up on maps, it shows as a laundromat.
——————————————
Old Review: (I left this review because Raul asked me to during the first month of handling my moms case)

This law group is extremely professional and attentive. My personal experience was with Raul and I am extremely satisfied. He is currently helping me handle my moms slip and fall case and has been very patient listening to my moms concerns and answering her questions. He also checks in and sends reminders before and after each appointment. Very text friendly which makes things easier for my busy schedule.</review><user>104737634011033407822</user>< Rate>

<review>My experience with Pirnia Law Group was great! It was a pleasure working with Aden. I was involved in a car accident a few months back and Aden was on the case since the first day making sure I was well taken care of. He followed up with me to know how the process was going and how my doctor visits were going as well. Any questions/concerns I had Aden was there to explain it thoroughly. I highly recommend this law firm group. Everyone is kind when you walk into their office and they get the job done right. I appreciate everything you guys have done for me 🤗< /review>< Pics>

I was involved in a 3 car accident and was rear ended in OC. I tried calling my insurance and having them figure it out for me, but I made the gut decision to call Hasan and Ali after being recommended by a friend.
They handled EVERYTHING from start to finish. I was almost lured into making a statement by an adjuster and they advised me to just ignore them and let them do the talking. I did just that and they got me a lot more money than what the adjuster offered. From 1100 to 1500 for my car damages and from 500 to 5000 for my medical. Pirnia law group is dedicated, humble, and attentive. Thank you to especially Ali and Hasan for handling this situation with such professionalism.
I will not hesitate to give them a call if I am ever involved in another accident or injury.<//text>

I have been going through a divorce and Ardy had his chief Litigation attorney Brankica Balaban help me with my case. She reallly put alot of time and effort to help me. My soon to be ex-wife filled a temporary restraining order against me to get me out of the house and not to be able to see my kids anymore. We went to court and won the case, and now im back home with my kids. She did a awesome job and now we are working on the divorce. I would recommend The Pirnia Law Group if you need a great attorney to help you.< /text>

I just concluded my time with the Pirnia Law Group with Ms. Brankica. I was in an accident late Nov. 2019 that resulted in injury. I was referred to the Pirnia Group by a friend who previously used them. My initial inquiry was responded to by Seth almost immediately. He connected me with his colleague Brankica. She was very professional, communicative and when my insurance company started treating me like the bad guy (despite the fact that the lady who hit me 100% accepted fault with no argument from day 1) she was very aggressive in defending me and demanding the maximum pay out for my pain and suffering. Also, she made sure that our car was fixed quickly. Car was picked up by a company they suggested, $500 deductible waived and they even took our rental back for us! I literally did not pay a penny for anything. On 11/11 2020 I was able to pick up a healthy sized settlement check that included funds from my insurance company due to the other party having subpar insurance coverage. I definitely hope I won't need their services again, but God forbid, if I do-- I know they'll take care of me.</text>

I broke a tooth as a result of eating cereal I had purchased which had a foreign object in it. The cereal company's insurance company was maddening as they belittled my claim. When I looked for a law firm to represent me, several firms turned me down. I finally found attorney Asa Yashar at Pirnia Law Group in Beverly Hills, California.

This was not a big case, but it was a big case to me as it was my tooth and a very real injury. Asa Yashar spent two years on the case! Two years! Every time I would email him, he emailed me back immediately. His attitude was always positive and supportive.

Any lawyer can pursue a big settlement case, but Asa Yashar put worth into my case regardless of its size. He pursued my case for the same reason I was pursuing it, because it was the right thing to do. This is the attitude you want from your attorney. His attitude and the way your attorney treats his clients is everything ... I highly recommend attorney Asa Yashar at the Pirnia Law Group.< /text>

<review>I would highly recommend this law group.The two men I worked with through out my case were Conrad and Asa. They worked hard and showed immense compassion for me and anything I needed through out the whole case. Asa and Conrad were a pleasure to work with, and always followed up with me to make sure I knew what was happening every step of the way. They are kind, gracious, and truly care that their clients get the best deal possible. They made sure I had a wonderful team of doctors and physical therapist. They made sure the locations were close to my home as well. I never had  to deal with an issue without them right by my side the whole way. Overall, I can’t recommend them enough, and would use Ardy and his Firm again if needed.Thank you for being there for me guys!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I found myself getting into an accident last November just before the holidays. I was worried and frustrated because I’d be out of a car to get to and from work. Luckily, Seth came to my rescue! He got me set up with a rental within minutes after my accident, got my car into the auto shop and took care of finding me a doctor that was kind and professional. I am thankful for Pirnia Law Group and Seth and highly recommend them to anyone who may find themselves in a similar situation.< /review>

Asa Yashar & Ardy Pirnia have been my attorney for over 3 years and handled many cases for me and to my satisfaction. they're knowledgeable and quick to get to the salient points of an issue. I have always appreciated that he always responds quickly to my calls and keeps my informed throughout the process. Having been to court with Asa and Ardy from Pirnia Law Group, I can say that he is persuasive and aggressive when necessary. During our 5 year relationship I have always felt comfortable that I am well protected. Thank you Asa Yashar & Ardy Prinia from Pirnia Law Group!<//review>

If you’re looking for someone to get you the best results, I recommend the Pirnia Law Group. The entire team is very welcoming and makes you feel as though you’re in good hands. Mr. Ardy Pirnia Esq. is the best at fighting for what you truly deserve. My case took a bit over a year as expected... and, I was more than pleased with the end results of my settlement.

<Review>Pirnia Law Group is hands down the BEST law firm ever! I was in a car accident a few months back that left me in a lot of pain and with no idea with what to do next. Luckily, my cousin referred me to Ali, Hasan, and this amazing firm to take care of my case and it's been the best decision I ever made to call them. Ali and Hasan immediately jumped on my case and handled everything that had me feeling overwhelmed with swift and effective care. They were in constant communication with me making sure to keep me updated every step of the way so I never had to wonder what was going on. Their hard work got me the highest settlement possible and I couldn't be happier with what I received! They are true MVP's so if you're looking for someone to handle your case after an accident, don't hesitate to call and ask for Ali and Hasan. They will make sure you're taken care of with their top of the line work!</Review>< resp>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>In November of 2018 I experienced a life changing accident that left my car completely totaled and would later find permanently impacted my body. The temporary relief of getting out of my car and finding the woman who had hit me was unharmed, was immediately followed by another wave of panic as I called my insurance to find out my policy had been cancelled that month due to an automatic payment not going through. Shock and fear took over every cell of my body. Although the accident was not my fault, the sudden realization that I was now an uninsured driver involved in an accident left me feeling anxious and fearful. After a sleepless night of trying to explain the situation to my insurance company and ultimately failing, I decided that it was time to seek legal guidance. That morning I contacted several different attorneys all of whom rejected my case upon hearing my insurance had been cancelled. My final phone call was to Pirnia Law Group. They heard my story and met with me that same day. Upon leaving the office, I instantly felt more calm and saw a glimmer of hope. Not only did Asa and Ardy get me the money back for my totaled car, but also made sure to put me in contact with the right doctors to help alleviate the physical and emotional damage caused by the accident. Asa and Ardy constantly checked in with me to see how I was feeling and made sure to make my health and well-being their number one priority. Considering my situation, receiving a compensation check at the end of this was just an added bonus. I’m so grateful for having had the amazing support of Pirnia Law Group through this difficult time!< /Review>< pictures>

If you ever get into a accident, this is the law firm for you.No one wants to to get into an accident .but if you do , this law firm will handle everything for you from a to z i had a pleasure of working with hugo and asa .they were an amazing team hugo was super responsive throughout the entire process everytime i called him he either answered or got back to me later that day. Hugo and asa made sure i got the treatment i needed to not only help my injuries and pain but also made sure i walked away with a just settlement for what i had to go through<//Text>

Best lawyers I have dealt with Ardy and Asa, went above and beyond handling my case. I can say I was difficult client due to my work schedule but they were able to make everything work and I hardly had to lift a finger. If your looking for someone who keeps you informed and gets you the settlement you deserve you are in good hands. They’ve taken care of two accidents of mine and I’ll forever be a client. Thanks for the help through a difficult situation.<//review>

After my accident I was overwhelmed with the stress of what to do and also dealing with my injuries. Pirinia Law Group was recommended by a friend,a so I called. I am so happy and thankful that I did.
Pirinia Law Group was there through it all, they took care of everything from dealing with the other insurance company to my medical and physical therapy needs. A settlement was reached and was very happy with it.
Thank you Pirinia Law for taking care of everything!<//text>

<text>The whole team at Pirnia Law is amazing! This was my first ever accident and they were all extremely patient with explaining everything to me in plain terms. Seth spent many hours on the phone with me on the weekends and after hours helping me with everything that you need to deal with after an accident from buying the right car to finding the best chiropractor and PT. They all speak to you like you're their family, not a client. I would not be in the place I am after a double T-Bone that happened two months ago if it wasn't for the whole team at Pirnia. I would not feel so stress-free after any accident if it wasn't for them. Best decision I ever made was choosing these guys to handle my case. Thank you all SO much!!</text></record>

The Pirnia team was very efficient. I needed some quick legal advice and some contracts made I Worked with Ardy & Asa and was surprised at how fast they responded to my calls.  Ardy is very knowledgeable and did an excellent job explaining the law.  What really surprised me was a few days later Asa called just to check in on me. It was refreshing to work with a passionate and caring law team.< /Text>

Making sure I had everything I need to give me comfort after my accident. I’d give more than 5 stars if I could.<//review>

Ardy and his team are not only great and dedicated Attorney's but also a good friend which went the extra to get the best outcome from my case and my wife as well on a separate case.  If anyone is looking for an honest  & dedicated Attorney look no further .  Contact Pirnea Law Group. Thank you Ardy for your hard work.</review></record></dataset><record>

Terrible service the lack of communicatication  was very inconsiderate and unprofessional. I had juan and his assistant carlos. Not once but twice a check was issued out both which could not be cashed due to an issue with their accountant i have yet to receive payment for the third time and when i try to contact them it takes a day or 2 before they even respond and they are very condescending. I do not recommend using them</Review>

He was always available and kept me updated on the progress as well as working to uncover additional findings. I was in a lot of pain due to an accident and the doctors he suggested were top notch and helped to fix my back and neck. He is very versed in many forms of law while at the same time being very personable, which is rare. He has always been available for questions and checks on me every so often to see how I am doing, you just don't run across that everyday - especially in this city. My health was the main issue and he made sure I recieved the best care. I don't usually write reviews on anything, but this experience warranted it.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Communication with Ardy (Founder) is horrible! He is very unprofessional! He will never call you back. He has many, many jobs besides his own practice he is a corporate in-house lawyer to 6 OTHER businesses and therefore, has very little time to dedicate to his clients. DON"T MAKE THIS MISTAKE!!!<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1509343987258, 'text': 'Rachel,\n\nI am sorry you had a bad experience. Unfortunately the case was much more complicated than how it was initially presented.  I was willing to accept $1,000.00 for a case which typically any other family law office would require a minimum $3,000.00 retainer. Upon review of your documents it was apparent that it was going to be an even more time-consuming case than what was originally presented. I also left you a voicemail explaining that; nonetheless, I wish you the best and hope everything works out for you. I will continue to try my absolute best to help ALL those in need of excellent family law attorney services who at the same time cannot afford the proper representation.'}< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2b94f7066d049:0x7c44d9cb7139c17d< /GmapID><time>1509276902021< /time>< Name>

< Review>
Worst expierence I've ever had with an attorney. Doesn't even deserve 1 star!

Ardy contacted me claiming he could help me with a 1000 retainer, and to send him my court docs to review. He never got back to me when he knew I had a time sensitive issue. Not reliable what so ever!!!!</Review>

<Review>Simply the best attorney for fathers in a divorce case. You want to save your sanity, do you need someone who is knowledgable, honest, has integrity, and is willing to step up to the plate, and fight on your side, put your mind at ease, and work at fantastic pace for you. Then this is the right attorney for you.
I was introduced to Mr. Pirnia, by web portal referral, I was nervous, lost and needed direction. After talking to me for over an hour on the phone on his weekend, he took on my case full-press.
His staff, including the wonderful paralegal Dragana, kept me protected, calm, and abreast of what was about to happen.
I gained custody of my children, through a difficult and contentious divorce, from a partner that was unstable at best, and was driving me to that direction too.
Pirnia Group, handled everything so professionally, I could not believe it.
Ardy Pirnia has a heart of gold, and the knowledge to back it up.
Thank you for all you did for me Mr. Pirnia.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>This was first experience dealing with lawyers and the courts, when I first met Ardy it was over the phone and I was desperately looking for some help! I had got served my divorce paperwork a few days before I was heading out of town for training. Ardy was so professional and understanding of my situation, the petitioner had withdrawn all of the savings we had and left me and our children with only a few funds to survive off of until my next paycheck! Ardy was gladly to take on my case as long as I came up with some starter funds, I scrambled to borrow funds from family members and friends. During the two weeks I was gone, the Pirnia Group took care of my paperwork and reminded me to relax and stay focused on my training while they took care of my divorce. During my first court day, Ardy reminded me that everything would be okay, all paperwork was filed on time and just let the truth do the rest! At the end of that long grueling day, I was elated! The petitioner wanted everything, the house, the furniture, child support, alimony and anything else that could be taken! At the end I was relieved that the court say through all the falsified information and granted the bare minimum of everything and denied the house, child support, and the outrageous alimony amount the petitioner's lawyer was asking for! Thanks to the Pirnia Group for all your support and answering all my questions during the process, and meeting with me on Sunday mornings!<//text>< pics>

<text>I've lived in the Westlake Community for the majority of my life time. This local Bakery is my go for nearly everything, from Mexican sweet bread to Mása (dough to make Tamales and Sopés) Their pricing range is very economical as well.
I definitely recommend more people to come to this Bakery< /text>< resp>

Fantastic father/son team!  Needed a new trailer spare, they have a full line of new ones, but showed me a nice used one for a spare.  15 minutes later we were back on the road, also checked air pressure on our RV!  Great job guys!  Thanks!<//Review>

Fast and friendly, in and out quick. Only get 4 stars because they are like double the price but it was closest shop to me and i need 2 flats fixed quick. Other than that it would've been 5 stars<//Review>

Great service. Called to ask about flat repair, went in 5 mins later, was in and out in under 25 mins for a flat repair and tire rotation. All for $40 including tip. This father son duo is a solid team. Will definitely go there for my brakes, shocks oil changes and whatever else they can do.< /Text>

{'time': 1589847204270, 'text': "You brought in your Honda Accord for an alignment. We did not service your tires. We also explained to you that the tire size your car has is very problematic due to it having a very low profile. The size 225/30/20 is too small for your vehicle. Therefore, we are not responsible for the damage your wheel has. It's very common for those type of wheels to crack/bend. Wheel alignments do not cause wheels to break. We also inspected your Ford Escape for FREE and explained the parts it needed. We are very honest with our customers and we don't know where communication went wrong."}<//Response>
<text>They Cracked my rim and when I called to  let them know  they said they where not responsible for low profile rims,they should have mention this before they started to work on my car. This is poor business communication and will not return to this place</text><rating>1</rating>< pics>

Best tire shop I come from LA to visit my parents my car had a light on to check tires and I stoped at Camacho tire shop they are amazing, friendly, professional and really kind. God bless them 🙏. In LA I took the car for the same reason and they didn't even fix it they just put air. They really helped me and I recommend this shop to everyone. Thank you so much.<//review>

The owners son came right out to help us and soon so did his dad. They were friendly, professional but most importantly they treated us like we mattered. The owner did EVERYTHING that he could to help us and didn't ask for anything in return and for that, my wife and I will always be grateful for their time and help.

It's subway, it's consistent.  Ordered online and picked up the order.  Very glad I checked before leaving because I ordered and prepaid for 4 cookies but they left them off the order.   So double check your order for accuracy before leaving.< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I've ordered uber eats from this location multiple times over the past few months because i normally love subway, but whoever is manning the orders they receive doesn't bother to look what to add or take off. Ever since this location became the only one in PB, they have never gotten my order correct. Based on some of the other reviews, it sounds like it's one employee who is just not bothering to try. Please address, I would love to start ordering from you guys again.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< review>
Watch out, this place will overcharge you! I have had nothing but bad expiriences with the owner of this location, and we've gone in half a dozen times over the span if the last year... It shouldn't be called a Subway, as they never honor any of the subway commercials or coupons, even when they're still good. We decided to try one more time because our other favorite location no longer exists and this is the only subway in Pacific Beach. Big mistake. (The other worker told us they want to quit everyday because they are treated so terrible, and feel horrible and embarrassed in front of customers daily. Simply because the manager lady is so stingy and mean.) I get that people have bad days, but to wait 20 minutes for food and than have to walk away... (we order two sandwiches, a cold cut, and a tuna, both 12" and that was it. It was almost $20!!! She told us it was because of the tax, but it still didnt add up right...) I dont understand how this place is still even in business. We also had issues trying to get a big order catered, being told that we could make our order, set a date and pick it up, only to go in and be told that they don't do catering and left us high and dry on the day we made the order for. It's somoly a very unethical and unbusiness-like management system. If I could give 0 stars I would...< /review>

Somewhat of a personal staple, but not impressive as far as subways go. Make sure to leave out of the west exit instead of the east if you want to be able to turn onto the nearby street. The parking lot is very small as well, but usually has a space for smaller cars and trucks.</text>

I often come here on my lunch break considering I work closeby.  Sometimes I encounter a long line but it moves very fast.  The employees are polite and attentive.  I never had a bad experience.  The only hiccup that made me scratch my head was when they ran out of napkins and had a roll of paper towels as a substitute on the counter.   Still 5 stars!<//Text>

<review>Dude this location is just plagued by one poor employee working between 3-5 pm, almost every time I go in!!

Management should give these guys medals for suffering through cranky customers because they're so understaffed.

Will DEFINITELY not return to this location because of chronic staffing shortages. Cmon Subway! Get some more help down there!!!

Go to Mission Blvd one instead!!!< /review>< pics>

If Donnie moved any slower I’d expect him to be a sloth.  Only one person in the entire restaurant and it’s lunch time.  Terribly slow and terribly apathetic, doesn’t look like he wants to be there.  Definitely would not recommend this place, go further down the road for better service.</Text>

Everyone who works the late night shift here has to be stoned out of their mind. I guess if I was working the late night shift at a Subway I would probably be stoned out of my mind also. I came here the other night at like 11pm and there are three other people in line ahead of me. One person who doing all the sandwiches, and doing the cash register while one lady is standing there baking bread in EXTREME slow motion. I look in the bread racks and there is plenty of bread but she is just taking her sweet time making bread while there are people waiting in line. I finally had to say something so she would help with the line. These people are IDIOTS!< /review>

I got my speakers installed here back in November and I’m sorry it took me a while to write this review but well now this review is even more legit bc I’m just as happy w the job now months later as I was when he finished. The sound is perfect and he worked w my van which had custom work so it wasn’t the easiest job and just overall amazing customer service on top of competency and professionalism and trustworthy. I’d definitely go back and recommend ppl to go here. Thank you again for all ur help!!!<//text>

<user_name>Will Chandler< /user_name><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><Text>My secret go to business for window tinting in San Jose. The owner is honest and quick to help. I have taken 2 Volkswagen Jettas and a Tesla Model S. All three were done with a clean installation, no bubbles after it was set. They installed on curved windows including the rear window defroster with no issues. The Jetta 4 years later, still looking good, so they used high quality tint.

The Tesla, my baby, came out fantastic and really improved the interior temperature and protection from the sun.

Taking my Model 3 in for a tiny job as well. I expect the same 5 star job. I am confident that there will be no issues.

Note if you get a car tinted, be sure to follow the instructions about not rolling down the windows until the tint is set up properly.<//Text>< UserId.>

Hugo is awesome. If you're not satisfied with the service he will go out of his way to fix the problem. Super cheap and quality work. Although the younger looking kid is a bit rough with tint but the skinny looking guy is an expert! If you want to get your windows tinted go to El Tri Window tinting. Employees there are awesome!< /text>

< review>
So, I’ve been meaning to re-tint my rear windshield, however that’s a project that’s been put on hold due to the cost. The tint was bubbling and peeling off and overall made it very difficult to look out when backing up. After carving out some time, I made a couple calls and settled on El Tri Car Stereo and Tint to do the job. Hugo quoted me at a much cheaper price than the average place and he did a beautiful job at removing and reapplying my tint so now looking through it is as clear as day. I’m a happy camper!<//review>

So, I’ve been meaning to re-tint my rear windshield, however that’s a project that’s been put on hold due to the cost. The tint was bubbling and peeling off and overall made it very difficult to look out when backing up. After carving out some time, I made a couple calls and settled on El Tri Car Stereo and Tint to do the job. Hugo quoted me at a much cheaper price than the average place and he did a beautiful job at removing and reapplying my tint so now looking through it is as clear as day. I’m a happy camper!</text>

I have had two separate vehicles worked on here to install sound systems. Both times have ended up perfectly and for a very reasonable price! These guys will forever be my go to guys for anything to be installed on my truck. I have referred multiple people here and they have all loved their service. I have a crazy work schedule and they were very flexible in working with me even after I had to bail last minute once.< /text>

The owner here gave me a fair quote on the phone and then followed it up with a fair quote in person, was able to hook up a replacement stereo within 45 minutes (did it himself) and was patient enough to teach me how to use the bluetooth/usb in all features. I was thrilled!</Review>

<review>Nice people, just be prepared to be up charged if you're a woman arriving solo. The price for an SUV tinting went from 250 to 280 once the "boss" learned I was a woman with a new suv. I will just use the groupon in Fremont for $165 and get the same service. Next try, guys.</review></record>

<Text>I had my car windows tinted here about a month ago and i had to bring my car back in to fix the tinting on one window that was coming off. I called them and they told me to bring my car in and they will fix it for free. I tried to bring my car in on a saturday but they were to busy about a 3 hour wait so i brought my car in on a weekday around 12:00pm and They were busy again. So I took my car in this morning around 9;30am  and they started working on it right away and it was fixed in about 20 mins.k<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Terrible service. Did not correctly install a stereo and sub woofer, cut corners and did not finish putting all the screws back in. Bent some interior paneling to fit wiring. Squeezed wires into the worst areas.<//text>

Sam was so awesome! I popped by and told him my phone was having trouble when inserting a charger chord and he told me he could fix it for me free of charge (no strings attached). It took him about 5 minutes... by this point I was impressed by his service, professionalism and generosity and asked if I could pay him to also put in a new battery. He said he could and that it would only take him 15 minutes. I think it actually only took 10. Great spot, honest service, and fast results. Sam’s a great guy and you’ll be lucky to get his help.< /Text>

Brought my iPhone in for a new battery before I smashed it into the ground with frustration, and these guys made it all better. They replaced my battery in 30 minutes, were very nice and gave me tips on maintaining my new battery. I will definitely go to them for any battery and bulb needs.</Text>

< Review>
I would have given them 0 star if I could. I took my phone to their kiosk and the technician suggested to change the screen to fix the problem with my iPhone. I asked him what if the problem is something else and changing the screen does not help? He responded that their service has a warranty and I can go back to them. After changing the screen, my phone kept restarting every minute. The technician suggested that I take the phone home, fully charge it, and then the problem will be resolved. It didn't, so I went back to them the day after. However, the technician did not accept to refund my money. He said his boss will be mad at him if he does. I argued with him for half an hour and finally returned the screen WITHOUT RECEIVING MY MONEY BACK.

My advice: Stay away from these guys, otherwise you end up losing your money without having your iPhone fixed.< /Review>

Luckily while I was checking out the new Century City Mall I came across the Ucolor cart and Josh said he could replace my screen in 20 minutes or less with a 6 month warranty! Sure enough it was good as new within 15 minutes! So convenient and their customer service was superb, thanks guys! Highly recommended!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Dropped my phone at the Rose Parade and shattered my screen.. I heard about this kiosk from a coworker who highly recommended it for a quick fix - astonishingly, my already high expectations were surpassed by the level of service I received.

My cracked screen is good as new, and was fixed in record time. I purchased a new case and screen protector in the package and it still didn't cost more than just a replacement anywhere else.

Jake was my technician, whom I highly recommend very talented and personable. Do yourself a favor, and consult these guys for your phone repair!< /text>

<review>This is my second time using ucolor. Both times outstanding service and workmanship. Fast too. Highly recommend Matt. Make sure to look for them over by the new Macy’s at Westfield century city. They used to be inside the mall so make sure to seek them out in their new location.</review><GmapID>0x80c2bb8c7ef63c39:0x1e585e5eba8a460</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I needed a new tempered glass screen protector for my iPhone 7 and every where I went they wanted either $30/$40 for one. I stopped by the Ucolor kiosk and Matt sold me one and installed it for only $20! Great service, highly recommended!< /review>

<text>I am an international athlete and my phone recently broke while i was on tour but i'd had no time to send it to Apple because of my schedule. I spotted this store at the mall and decided to  drop by and see what they could do. 17 minutes later, i had a brand new screen (with a complimentary screen protector thrown in). Thank you Aries for your professional and prompt service.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb8c7ef63c39:0x1e585e5eba8a460< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Sam was a huge help and fixed all the issues on my iPhone 6 to include water damage, censor damage, and speaker malfunction. His shop is also open earlier than the competition, which helped me get on with my day. I'd recommend this location to anyone.< /Text>

COMPLETE SCAM. STAY AWAY. They gave me a new screen which shattered less than 24 hours later on a two foot drop in an otterbox case. When I returned, they offered a maximum $15 discount on another $75 repair. What a joke. Would rather just pay Apple once to do it correctly. Lesson learned.<//text>
