When I needed a van for work I found what I was looking for at Lupita's Modesto. I went to see it and I drove home with the van - so easy. Aftera year I needed a car for my personal use and the first place I looked was Lupita's. Same exceptional customer service and treatment. I bought  my Grand Cherokee on the spot and I am loving it. I couldn't recommend them more. I will definitely come back as business is growing. Thank you!<//Text>

Great customer service at Lupitas Modesto! I traded in my old commuter and got a new car and settled everything with no effort in couple hours. I need to buy a work truck soon and I’ll definitely come back first here to Lupitas Modesto. Shoutout to Cosmina and Carlos for top notch service.<//review>

<review>I worked with Horacio at Lupitas to purchase a car. The car needed to be delivered, as I live in a different city. At first I was concerned about buying a car remotely, but Horacio was very honest, professional, and accommodating throughout the entire process. The purchase was very low stress and I would definitely recommend Lupita's Auto Sales Modesto!</review><Name>Dillon Johnson< /Name>< user_id>

<Review>My parents bought a car from here a few years ago and experienced great customer service so when I was in the market for a car this was our first stops. I have to say I was not disappointed.

This dealership is great! My wife and I came in and let me say that this was the easiest and most hassle free experience I've ever had buying a car. And quick!
The girls were great to work with and answered all of our questions and delivered high costumer service. Went above and beyond for us as well as super friendly and made us feel very comfortable. I highly recommend Lupita's Modesto.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>My husband was looking to buy a truck. We checked out several dealerships and ended up at Lupitas.  We met up with Maria.  She is very friendly and also speaks Spanish which is a plus. If you are looking for a used car or truck come check out this place. And my husband did buy a 2017 truck with very little mileage. Thank you Maria!< /Text>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>The experience working with Lupita's Auto Sales was a complete nightmare.
We live out of state but the drive isn't too far and my father-in-law really liked a vehicle they had at their Modesto location, so we drove to attempt to purchase it.
After taking a look at a few different vehicles a decision was made on one he really liked, there were a few things that needed some work and they offered to fix it or give us a credit for it. We chose to have it fixed, drove back the following weekend to pick-up the vehicle.
After filling out all the paper work needed, we were ready to hit the road!
14 miles into the drive the check-engine light comes on.
We called the office and the "manager" says "no more excuses" whatever that means. We got back to the dealership & were told we could leave the vehicle or getting it repaired in our home state & they would reimburse us.
We decided to take the chance, it drove fine.
Arrived at our destination, safe & sound.

Then came the nightmare of having the vehicle registered.
They insisted on registering it, in the state of California, even though our home state was Nevada.
I legally CANNOT have a vehicle registered in California if I reside in Nevada.
We were told this was being taken care of & we would have a response in no time.
Eventually called a different person who, tells me she knew nothing of our situation & states he would take care of it.
Finally 4 weeks later, after getting passed on to multiple people we received the document we needed to register the vehicle.

Perhaps its that we purchased out of state, but this isn't a place I'd ever recommend.</text>< pics>

<review>I don't recommend this dealer but take your risk and ask for the history of the vehicle your buying my husband bought a truck here it only lasted 3 years for the motor to give out. We went back look for the guy that sold us the truck no one new who he was, they told us he was no longer an employee there how convenient for them.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I hired Allegiance to replace my AC, furnace and ducting in my house.  Everything was OLD and undersized.  The technicians who replaced all of this handled it within two days.  They were extremely professional and respectful of my home, cleaned up at the end of every day and thorough.  I am extremely satisfied with the service from Scheduling all the way through the entire process.  The quality of the products and the pricing cannot be beat.  Thank you so much Allegiance.</text>

<Text>Excellent service! We had a problem with an electric fireplace in Downtown San Diego and we needed someone who can get the job done they were referred to me so I gave them a call and before I knew it they came out and handled everything with great customer service. I would definitely use them again and refer them to friends or family. Give them a call today they'll take care of you.</Text>< Pics>

Theyve always done a good job. This is there 4th time here. Today was just a tune-up. Ill keep calling on them because their techs seem super knowledgeable. I got this ac system from Sears. It was a nightmare at first. So now its all good in the hood.<//text>

They were able to send someone out the same day I called. Chris was very friendly and knowledgeable about fixing my  air conditioner.  He was more than willing to answer all of my questions so I could better understand my system and what it might need.  He replaced a questionable electrical connection.  But also diagnosed that our capacitor was not operating at it's full performance level he gave me the information and allowed me to decide if I wanted to replace this somewhat expensive part.  So far the unit is running much better.  I would gladly call on Allegiance Heating and Air Conditioning to work on my system again as if needed.<//Text>

Our heat stopped working and it was getting very cold at night. I call Allegiance and they were promt and on time.  They had my system working in short order and did a full heating system check up. I have recommended them to my landlord and they will be the company she will use for all of her properties.<//Review>

For rental properties they are still getting some kinks out but are headed in the right direction. The good news is their technicians are knowledgeable and friendly. Where they still need improvement is in minimizing call-backs on new system  installs.

I recently  installed two mini splits (AC units) on a property and both times  they had to come back later. I appreciate that they were concerned about other work going on, but I’m convinced that some or all of the callbacks could have been avoided. Even so, they are always improving and for that reason I’d use them again.< /Review>< Pictures>

I run an apartment complex and their usual A/C guy had looked at a units A/C unit 2 times and still had no answer and said it was working fine. Allegiance came in and found a problem right away. The guys that came out were very thorough and attentive. I would definitely recommend Allegiance to anyone.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Excellent service. Both techs were very careful when removing the old (very large) unit down a flight of steps in my condo. No dings on my walls or hardwood floors. They showed up within 10 min. of the expected time and completed the job on time. Ed answered all of my questions and made some great suggestions for better distribution of the cold air throughout my condo.
Allegiance also gave me a $500 discount for "same day service" (even though installation was a few days later) which brought their quote to almost $1000 less than the second quote I received.
I would definitely recommend them to my friends.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>Very easy to schedule appointment.  Got one for the next day. Office staff was friendly and helpful in providing information. The technician was Jon. He was very polite and was really motivated to get my heat back on. Is a very old system but he was able to figure it out and get it going. And he was able to complete the job in one visit. We were given a 10% senior discount.  Highly recommend for their work quality and professionalism.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<text>Allegiance is now my go to company for Heating and A/C.  I called based upon a coupon for an A/C tune-up and filter change for a very reasonable price of $69.00.  The technician was friendly, easy to communicate with and did an outstanding job, including going to Home Depot to purchase the proper 4" filter my A/C and Heating unit required at no extra charge and with a smile.

He also told me that my A/C unit was working perfectly and that gave me and wife piece of mind as we enter the summer months.

What more can I say but give this company a try and see if you are as satisfied as I am.

The technician, Jon, is an experienced professional, who methodically checked and took good care of everything. He was very kind, honest, patient,  and took time to answer all our questions re. the current condition of our A/C system. We are very impressed with this first service by Allegiance, and look forward for continued business relationship.</Review>< Pics>

Chris was our technician, we were having an ac tune  up to make sure our ac was working fine before the summer.
Chris called ahead of time to let me know he was on his way. When he showed up, he was very professional and explained what he was going to do and started working. He would let me know if he noticed anything and explained everything to me in a clear and precise way.  I was very happy with the service provided by Chris and the company Allegiance heating and air conditioning.  I will definitely be calling them back .</text>

I can’t say enough great things about Allegiance Heating & Air.  I’ve used this company several times for work purposes and also in my own home.  The owner Sarah is amazing, very responsive, and is always able to send a tech within 24 hours of calling in a service need.  The techs are highly professional and very skilled.  I would recommend Allegiance 1k times over!</text>

Absolutely highly recommend Allegiance. I called the afternoon before and they were there first thing the next morning (coldest day of the year). Lawrence showed up and made quick work of servicing/repairing our furnace. Everything works great and we have heat again. Lawrence was a great guy, was very friendly, and was good with our dogs. Will definitely use Allegiance for any of our future needs.</review>

I have worked with Sarah's team at Allegiance for many years now. She has helped my personal HVAC for my home, my clients' homes, and most recently with my rental properties. They always show up in the time frame given, have experienced techs, and are fairly priced. I definitely recommend them for any new HVAC installation or repair needs.</Review>

I had solar installed today by a partner of Allegiance, after a previous new A/C, heat unit from Allegiance. I was so pleased with their product and customer service, I went ahead and went solar, something I’ve thought about for a long time, and knew I’d found the right company to get it done right. Well run, honest company with high customer service standards. I highly recommend Allegiance.</Text>

Allegiance installed the HVAC system in my 1940's home, and they did a great job.

The technician was extremely polite and professional, and their prices were very fair, with no last-minute add-ons or hidden charges in the final invoice.

They're a small family-run business that takes pride in their work and treats people right. I've happily referred them to other friends and neighbors who have also had a great experience.<//text>

Love it! They did data recovery for me on a solid state (sd card) and hard drive. Both were recovered and I paid the optional expedited fee; which got me results rather quickly, to my surprise.

Thank you!<//Review>

<review>Not sure why there are a few bad reviews. I called ahead to get a quote. $110 for a 7+ screen replacement. Not bad at all. They had the part in stock and the owner Bob said they would hang around for me if traffic was bad. Very nice, wasn’t expecting that.
When I got in, everything went quick and smooth and I was out in about 15 minutes.
The posters they have around the shop made me laugh.
Overall great experience. Glad to be able to support this small business. Will definitely be back for future needs.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOz-pmBTSi2aWNrvUUDHqSeRvb1l1JI1rNmM10r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3YzOdRFLPAf0SVeLvXDUhy77YlRd4OSLg1XCU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn7VNDkhB5zWMqpUm1vKNpmqxCRyU-rJ-tbZuq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

They did an excellent job. Saved myself 60 bucks. Let me explain. These guys charged me 188.95 while Verizon charged me 250 dollars. Plus it took them like 20 minutes to fix my phone. Bob was also really polite and made sure to inform me on everything that would happen. Would highly recommend this place for phone repairs. Also they have comfortable chairs.</Review>

Although the service was really fast and definitely quicker than the average third party phone repair. The owner of this place really needs to train its staff for the way they treat their customers. The way the employees there treated me was so bad that it instantly made the experience of going there rather terrible. I was served at the cashier by this guy who would not even bother to answer my questions and say that it is all my fault. Definitely go to this place if you have a lot of patience.<//review>

Been here twice now. This time to replace the battery on my nexus 6p. They did a great job. Was warned that repair might hurt the case (cosmetic issue only), but they did a great job and got my phone back in great condition. Also if you need the same, you will need to purchase your own battery (was easy on ebay).<//Review>

My son broke his screen at least every 6 months, sometimes more often. Pretty hard on phones. These guys were always fair and fast. After the 4th or 5th visit, hey even tried to talk him into getting a screen protector and/or otterbox so he would stop spending so much fixing his phone. My turn, I have to go today for MY phone screen, and go I will.</text>

Asked to replace my S4's screen. They fixed it within an hour, the deal was about putting new screen. However, the screen looked like picked from used phone. When I pointed it out, they agreed to cancel the deal w/o any additional cost.

To the owner: you handled the situation well, but I suggest sticking to ethics and honesty will take you long way.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

i brought a Moto G5+ to them with a cracked screen to be repaired.  They said that they would need to order the replacement glass and charged me in advance for the repair.  When the glass arrived I brought the phone back to them and they replaced it.  While the glass looked ok, as soon as I made a call, I discovered that the proximity sensor had been damaged (which results in the screen going black whenever you make a call).  They agreed to try the repair again and I brought the phone back to them.  After this glass replacement, the proximity sensor was still broken and the fingerprint reader became intermittent.  They offered to refund the repair fee, but ONLY IF they removed the glass.  This would have rendered the phone unusable so I could not agree to that until I had bought a replacement phone.  I used the phone, being careful not to initiate any calls on it (because of the proximity sensor) until my new phone arrived.  The next day the repair glass they had installed had cracked without the phone having been dropped or mishandled.  When my new phone arrived, I transferred all the data over and brought the phone back to them.  They now refused to refund the repair fee because they could no longer remove the glass in one piece.  The bottom line is I brought a phone to them for repair, the "repair" damaged the phone further, and they refused to refund the money I paid.< /text>

I brought my tablet in for repair, without checking on it,  he said my LCD screen needs to replace and that his vander does not carry the model. He asked me to buy it from EBay ($299)bring it in and he will replace it for me , then charge $50 for labor. Not wanting to spend that much money, I took my tablet to another place which they inspected my tablet throughout, told me my LCD is intact, they ran a FREE diagnostics test and fixed my tablet. It could cost me$349 at this place have I not checked on other place for second options. I'll never come near this store. Ever.< /review>

got my AT&T samsung galaxy s3 fixed here in an hour. most places I called need to take 2 days to one week and price is higher. I was told they have best technician in this location who had over 15 years pager/cell phone repair experiences. I saved over $400 compare buying another one from AT&T. Thanks you Fast Repair.< /text>

<Text>I called the mobile repair shop, to find out if they could look at my Samsung, that appeared not to be charging. I was informed to call after 10:30 as the technician did not arrive until then. So I called promptly just after 10:30.... I also asked if they had the spare part to the charging port, as I thought that could be the problem. Because they were the only shop in the area to carry the spare part that I thought could be the cause of the problem, I told them that I would be on my way, as I needed the phone working properly urgently. When I got there there was a person in front of me, who was told that if you want to wait for the job to be done that you needed to make an appointment. I was not told such a thing on my two previous phone calls, the last one, twenty minutes earlier!....so by the time I was served there were other jobs ahead of mine and that I would need to wait for and hour and half.......so I left the phone for inspection and repair. On my return an hour and half later, they informed me that the charging port was not the problem and that they didn't know what the problem was....so I got home two hours later still with a phone that was not working.
My son in law, had a look at it, turned it off, removed the SIM card and it worked!....how is it possible that the technician did not think of that.... It would have saved me precious time and stress!!</Text>< Rate>

<Review>I came in with a broken note 2, while visiting palo alto.  It took them only a day to get the part, and I came in at 10 the next day to get the 1 hr repair done.  BUT the tech doesent come in until 1130! I had to be in the city by then,  and I needed my phone!  So they gave me a refund.  Cant say anything about the repair, but the guy at the register was understanding and didnt give me any bs, which was nice.< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) They are scammers. The American who attends stayed with a cell phone that we brought him and did not want to return it. I feel very powerless. I advise you to go elsewhere. I saw in a different post that the same thing happened to someone. I don't know if the owner of the store knows what these thieves are doing but they should close down that store and report them to the police.

(Original)
Son unos estafadores. El americano que atiende se quedó con un celular que le llevamos y no lo ha querido devolver. Me siento muy impotente. Les aconsejo que vayan a cualquier otro lugar. Vi en un post diferente que a alguien le pasó lo mismo que a nosotros. No se si el dueño de la tienda sabe lo que están haciendo esos ladrones pero deberían cerrar ese local y reportarlos a la policía.< /text>

<review>Really great, kept trying to find an Escondido pizza places that did fresh slices after lunch hour! This place is legit. Huge slices and very fresh ingredients. The dough is very light and delicious, it didn't leave me that heavy full feeling. Nice friendly ownership, seems family owned. Bonus: across the street from Peterson's Donut shop!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Pizza Amore is the best pizza in the entire North county San Diego. I have been eating their pizza ( same owner) since I was about 12 years old and I am now 37 ! The owners work so hard and they are very kind and friendly. Very family oriented people. I along with many more people, am always greeted “Hello Sarah how are you and your family it’s so nice to see you”. They make their pizza with love and hard work through the long hours. I absolutely will not eat any other pizza and I AM A PIZZA LOVER! I also live in a whole different city! And we still order from Pizza Amore!
I am so grateful that Pizza Amore has stay opened for our community during these hard times! And I am so happy that I am able to eat great food while supporting these wonderful people in their family owned business .</text>< Pics>

<review>A loyal customer here! No hidden charges compared to another pizza place. I'll be giving my "5" stars all the way for them. Cheers to more customers and success in the future. I will visit again together with my friends and co-workers next time for sure. It was a nice experience for me for the first time.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>I like the pizza but they really need to have options for the crust. Cheese, garlic, ranch, something! And the lady here is very rude to people including the old man that works with her. She’s very straight to the point and doesn’t care. I asked for lots of cheese and peppers when ordering over the phone and they gave me none when I got there. So I asked again and only got 1 each. Which is not enough for a medium size pizza. The parm cheese will cover about 2 pieces. Good pizza for the price but rude lady.</text>< Pictures>

Rad. 20” pepperoni, New York style. Fits the bill for a slice.<//Review>

I live in Fallbrook, CA 25 miles from this place.  Logistically, if I’m passing by and want great pizza I stop by.  For a very reasonable charge I get my 16” pie meatball, onion, black olive.  Perfect for days! ❤️❤️❤️❤️<//Text>

Stopped by when on business travel and met a very nice couple who own the place. Guess it's been around for quite a bit and they do make a good thin crust pizza. Could use just a tad bit more toppings, but the dough is very good and makes up for it. They also have a few specials so check those to see if one will fit your appetite. Saw that they make a really large pie for groups, but haven't tried it yet.<//text>

<review>I just left this pizzeria with my 8yr old daughter. We were waiting on line while a gentleman paid for his food and my daughter had to go potty. He heard her saying it and when I went to ask him, before I even got to finish my sentence he says very rude ah no! I mean really? As much as I buy from here and as kind and generous with tips as I am here. Your rudely going to tell my 8yr old ah no! Before I even finish the sentence? I hope you don't have kids or grandkids buddy. And if you do I hope they don't have to go potty when they go to grab food somewhere. I'm a strong believer in karma. But at the same time I hope they don't end up at a place like this one with a person as mean and rude as this guy!<//review>< pictures>

We try to go here regularly. We already found our favorite waitress; she always greets us when we come in and makes you feel like you're the only person in the room while she's taking your order. The food is great, the staff is great, what's not to like?</Text>

Worst place ever. No restroom even if your sitting in to eat. One cheese and one pepper packet PER PIZZA. Regardless of how many people are eating with you. The owner is extremely rude. He sat in a chair behind the register, staring at me while he was yelling for someone to come from the back to ring me up. Paid to add olives and there was literally like 5 olives on the whole pizza. So little cheese that you could see the dough throughout the pizza all over. I live so close that it would be nice to be able to walk and get dinner but I will NEVER go here again. Same experience both times I tried this place. Would give 0 stars if I could :)< /Text>

<Text>Very much in the tradition of a neighborhood pizza joint, don't expect fancy accommodations, or neighborhood. I always order out. Owner is a good guy. Pizza is more in line with authentic New York style than most places. If you want to be a hit at your next big gathering, order the giant pizza. People freak out at the size (order it cut for parties, not slices, if you want smaller pieces).</Text>< Pictures>

Very good NY style pizza, and that's coming from a New Yorker. To those of you complaining about the crust, go to Domino's..
NY style pizza is not about the crust but the ingredients. You can taste the quality!<//Review>

Reading reviews online and believing them has bitten me more than once.

The short review: The pizza is decent

The long review:  I walked in to order.  The man must have been having a bad day, he didn't look like he wanted to be there.  Who would...it is 100 degrees outside and they have no air conditioning inside...what's up with that?

I place my order and tell him that I really like mushrooms and asked if I should order extra mushrooms to make sure i get my fill of them...he said "no, we put plenty on, you'll like it.  If you don't, order more next time".  I said Okay and paid for the pizza.

As I walked over to sit down to wait for the pizza (sweating) a cockroach crawls across the floor, in broad daylight!  I've seen some roaches in my time, and they don't like to come out in the day time unless they are very comfortable doing so.   Given the location of the restaurant, roaches do not seem out of place.

The rest of the place seemed clean, but when I got my pizza, it smelled good and i took it to the hotel.  When I opened the box, I was a bit disappointed in the number of mushrooms...should have ordered extra :(

For what it's worth, I won't get pizza there again while I'm going to be here in the area.  It was better than the cheap joints, not the best I've had though.< /Review>

<text>This is probably my favorite place in Escondido it's a family-run business they are all very very nice very accommodating and always professional and loving. This is what America was made on family run businesses such as Pizza Amore on 9th Avenue  Escondido Boulevard and 9th I would suggest it over and over and over again I order my place pizza from no other place. They're closed hard-working family and deserves all of our business<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Hamir the owner makes the best new york style pizza's. I grew up in Queens and my local pizza parlor was exactly like this. Tapping the underside of this pizza sounds as it should. Excellent ingredients and friendly service, love this place as do my grandkids and friends I recommend to.<//review>

This is the closest thing to NY style pizza you'll find on the west coast. I had previously ordered from a different location claiming to be NY style, and the sauce was more like salsa from a jar. The sauce here was real marinara. I especially liked the way the eggplant parmesan tasted.</review>

Only joint I seem to find around Escondido that serves big NY-style thin slices.  This place has been around forever and I'm glad it's still here now that I've moved back.  Only wish they had delivery hours all day and not just in the evening.< /Text>

<Text>The slice is the way to go! If you like the good grease (worry about your heart later!) They throw whatever toppings on a par-baked giant slice into the oven for about 5 min. You got that perfect crunchy gooeyness. Great lunch option. Get two!</Text>< pics>

<text>Will never come back.

Went in the middle of the day with a couple friends, zero people inside. Pizza was meh, ordinary and basic which matched the price. Owner was VERY rude when we picked up the pizza, very stingy on cheese/pepper (one packet for all 3 of us?).

If your business is slow and you want more customers, don't be rude to us. If we kindly ask for more cheese and peppers, don't bark at us that we already got some, especially when you forgot to put them in the box in the first place.

We wanted to support a family business but after this, we'll just walk next door to Little Caesar's and settle for Corporate Pizza instead.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

What a find! If you’re looking for great pizza this is the pizza, this is it.  Made my first visit a few weeks ago and I immediately  declared this my favorite pizza place in Escondido.  The owner was fantastic - very cool.  I told him what I liked and he made a us one fantastic pie (he called it the Zorba!).  This is old school pizza place - they don't try to suck your kids in with toys and games (although they did have two classic video games), and it's not the place to take your wife on your anniversary - it's just damn good pizza, at a good price, made by good people.  They have been here for over 20 years!  The salad and wings were great too.  Highly recommend you try it.<//Review>

They make a huge pizza. It tastes good. It's a good alternative when you get tired of national chain pizzas. They claim its New York style. I wouldn't know. The bad thing is they seem to ignore any minor special requests like extra sauce. Almost like they know better than you. You no lika my pizza! I no lika you!< /text>

If your feeding a large group this is a decent pizza place for the price. If you want quality pizza with great tasting ingredients I would suggest you keep looking.<//text>

Got the $5 dollar pepperoni pizza and was really good. Normally don't like thin crust but was great. A lil greasy if you don't like grease but we'll worth it and amazing price for the quality. Plus awsome donut shop right across the street. First time to the area and it was a great lunch< /Text>

Was pretty quiet when I went in the end of August. I'm sure it has a lot to do with the pandemic and fires. Less crowded beach area and lake and trials. Didn't feel like it use too. But it was a well needed trip...< /review>

Really peacefull campsite. It is very clean, but make sure to check their map first because there are sites that is crowded or very close with the neighbors.

PROS:
Really close to Pinecrest Lake.
Bear Box is available.

Cons:
Very busy camp site.
During Lockdown, Shower areas are closed.</Review>

<Review>My family has been camping at the Pinecrest campground for generations, which is means there is a wonderful reason we keep coming back. Pinecrest is home to gorgeous scenic views, a freshwater mountain fed lake full of delicious fish (make sure to have your license), and plenty of outdoor activities for all.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9JPzpokswX2_kc3Cz6NYeM9GT7qrU8ED8akTp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi-cJ1ksUUe26WsaD5gv8283y2Hyl6xUm0dBJ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7-xuO8P4AwL6ary5Yf7LuF8qKgy6OqFwnnKiT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuLWdPfhPUTBfn2DHDnvzlO_5LQTzeLHcGa5QC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNs6wxbpuHyrdMkrOQj64AGkr_bBuKVzMODSba=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQzdPZeTivy5nk-hsWHg5EpMEEnNz0vK8Ps0zT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtDsYg26AjxOwZy1h_-_GOdDfzUx-fjBneBgkH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZkqQWCYWSnySkt8C0aYUHvXlStQE73XBJrwDv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x8097483df59ccac9:0x828f7de149bc8193</GmapID></record>

<Review>Today, I drove to Pinecrest & hiked the trail around the lake. Took this ol gal 5 hours & I was tired, pooped! It’s a popular trail - dogs, kids, everyone, with some litter here & there. And, next time, I’m bringing 3 liters of water & snacks & a littler bag! The water fountains at the bathrooms were down & the bathroom was closed at the halfway point on the trail. But, it was beautiful all the same.<//Review>< UserId.>

Pinecrest Campground is a wonderful place to swim, sail and to hike around one of the most beautiful lakes in California. If you have asthma, please be careful due to the poor air quality. Right now it is the smoke, from the fires, that is the problem. Over the last five years, I have had severe asthma attacks from the campfire smoke that hovers above the campground. If you don’t have asthma or a compromised immune system then you will be fine.<//text>

Campsite was big and well maintained. Pinecrest Lake is a hidden gem. Beautiful and better than Tahoe to me. Plenty of parking close to the lake (maybe due to Covid-19?). My family had a really great time.< /review>

Beautiful way to spend a family trip! The beach was nice and clean with a beautiful view and clean water. We had so much fun here for our first time . We did a small hike but not to far due to family not being able to. THe snack bar was awesome especially since we didnt bring enough, just pricey but worth it. You can also rent boats which we will try out next time.<//review>

<date>1566424725318</date><rating>4< /rating><review>This was our first visit and we really enjoyed it. The sites sit among tall trees and everything smells so good. The lake is only a short walk from the campground. The downside is it is very popular so it's tough to get a spot in the summer. And the roads are very narrow, so maneuvering our travel trailer through the campground wasn't easy.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMG5RLlRl1Tvr9Kg-JiKPZTmLnlux2Vu1zAdmSa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpAS0cDBufNpL9iOxeYNhkcT43uSkK5oCXN2IR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnySNMUGYyeatpxPy0P8SWc5FgHAJ4YW212abn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeDoZe15s3URLULtLCd0KXDLBgn9D294gpYSCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Pinecrest campground has been our spot for 15 yrs now, we go once a year and stay for at least 5days, anything shorter is depriving your inner child of playtime. The sites are always clean at check in and the restrooms are maintained accordingly, be sure to report any unruly guests, we had too last time just to keep it clean, kids were having a wet toilet paper war in one of the RR. Remember you can't control the weather and you can't pick your neighbors, so enjoy the stay as best you can, do your research on peak visit/camping days, weather/ fire/road conditions. Check the website for rules and regulations. Cheers.</review>

Love Pinecrest and have been coming here for years! I will say in the most recent years and specifically my last trip (Sept 2019) there were drivers who were completely unaware of what an appropriate speed should be through a campground.  Pinecrest needs to post a speed limit throughout the campground loops, include in camping reservations and  remind at check-in. It’s very scary to watch your children riding bikes on the campground roads where  drivers think it’s appropriate to go 15 miles an hour!</text>

I visited there in September 2018. It was a very nice place for camping. The place has a lot of tall pine trees. During the weekend that we visited in September, a movie was aired and people enjoyed a live concert so that a lot of young people participated in camping.
It was freezing at midnight. The lake that’s in a walking distance from the camping area though was very beautiful.</Text>

Pinecrest is great. Hiking around the lake takes about 2 hours. You can venture further up the mountain to Cleo's bath, where the snow run of feeds the lake. There's a good beach/swim area. Boats can be rented for cruising around. It's also great that there is a speed limit, so no wake boarding or water skiing keeps wakes and traffic low. Outdoor movie night is fun, ice cream from the store is a nightly ritual. Items at the store are a little expensive, but it's the only store for miles..... supply and demand....

Yes, this place is POPULAR, and during peak season is nearly impossible to get into last minute. You are allowed 2 vehicles and 2 tents per site, or 1 vehicle, 1 tent and a camper. With no more that 6 people per site. The reason it can seem over crowded is due to the HUGE tents, extra vehicles, and extra stuff that people bring. Certain sites are huge and can acomodate large tents, barbecues, multiple pop up canopy etc. Other sites are more confined and would be best for a couple do tents and 2 suv's. Leave your long bed deseil truck at home unless you get a site that can accommodate it! Book in advance, and ask how big the site is!</review>

<Review>We stayed here 2 nights in June. Really beautiful place right by the lake. Well kept and clean toilets. We got a nice secluded spot. No showers on site but there are some at the general store.<//Review>< date>

The Pinecrest campground at Pinecrest Lake gives access to an idyllic High Sierra lake. Pinecrest Lake has a great tail going all the wat around, wonderful boating on pristine water, and great fishing. If you like swimming in High Sierra lakes, then you already know you’re going to freeze. Have fun though.</Text>

Extra parking is 1/2 mile away if you have an extra vehicle that won't fit in your space which is way too far away.  Most sites have little privacy unless you are on an outer loop.  Can get noisy at various times if parents aren't controlling their kids.  I never saw the rangers out enforcing any rules such as quiet hours.< /text>< pics>

Pure mountain joy. Best time is off season. On the weekends, there are usually 5k people there. Come when school goes back and you will have the lake almost to yourself.<//Text>

<review>Great place have been going since I was a kid  with my friends. Fast forward to present, very crowded, a lot of trash, and people coming up for the day stealing everyone's campsites. Still a fun place but during peak hours expect some chaos, especially if you have children.< /review>< Pictures>

For us it was a two year wait, last year we had to cancel our campsite booking due to bad weather. This year we finally made the trip during the 2017 memorial weekend. Yes, you do have to book these campsites at least 6 months in advance. There is no debate the lake area is really lovely and has some nice features with a general store complex, snack bar, movie theatre, beach access, boating and hiking options. However the other reviewers are correct about the crowds, lack of parking, close campsites, the rough campsite bathrooms (no showers), and the high noise levels. This is like camping in Yosemite at the height of summer in the fraction of the space. We recommend camping outside of the valley, staying in a remote cabin and just coming in for the day (6am-10pm for day parking). We are veteran campers and for us the night time noise was intense. We had at least three large groups in our area doing heavy partying with live music plus the sounds of the nearby open air movie theatre (D loop). We ended up leaving a day early just so we could get some rest, take a shower and escape from the noise. We would definitely come back in the future but we plan on sleeping elsewhere.</review>< Resp>

<Text>My campsite was huge and this is a great place for trailers. I recommend going later on in the year because the lake was freezing when I went in June.

Been here twice in the past month and my family and I love it here. The camp grounds are clean and spacious . lake is fantastic. There's even movie night at the out door movie theatre with the lake as the backdrop! It wasn't no 80's rerun either. We watched Pete's Dragon which just came out this week. I can't say enough about this place. Make sure to make reservations , or if you wanna push your luck there's usually "walk-up" sites that don't need reservations . writing this post as the camp fire crackles!</Text>

Absolutely love this location for hiking, camping, great for dogs, great for kids (outdoor theater with amazing staff) and just an easy place to get to. Fills up fast for tent camping so check recreation.gov daily leading up to the day of your trip.</Review>

The D loop of campsites was a bust for us.  The campsites are very densely packed and you end up feeling like you're right on top of other campers.  There's also little to no grass, and thus very dusty so be prepared for that.  Also, while it's nice to be so close to the lake in that you can walk to it that also means you're that much closer to the daytime hordes of people who come to hang out on the lakefront, particularly on weekends.  Some of these people see no problem in setting up their beach chairs and umbrellas right at the water's edge so that you are forced to literally walk through their stuff to actually get into the water.  The nicest part was being able to rent a 2-person kayak to go out on the lake and get away from the crowds for at least a little while.  The lake itself is certainly quite beautiful, so it's got that going for it.  Perhaps one of the other campsite loops (A, B, or C) would have been better, but I can definitely recommend avoiding loop D.</Review>

<text>Much of the campground is densely packed. A few sites have a lovely view and are acceptably spaced from the neighbors. The beauty of the campground is the access to the terrific Lake and movie theater. The lake is comfortable to swim in despite the elevation and the theater is wonderful.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Very disappointed.  Campsites are way to close together.  And due to the lack of respect from the other campers. "Dad's and their kids"  The kids were being kids but the dad's were disrespectful bums. Would not stay out of our camp site. I mean right outside the trailer and setting on our table putting their trash in our fire pit. Won't be back.  Not the campgrounds fault for the campers behavior.  Just to many inconsiderate people here for my likings.</Text>

Nice campground, I like that is in the middle of the woods only down side is that I’ll always smelled like smoke because everyone at night would have their fires and since the campground is surrounded by trees the smoke stays
and so you pick a smoky smell</text>

Great campground! So many pinetrees, great protection from the sun and wind. There is a general store that has absolutely EVERYTHING YOU NEED which is great if you forget an item or if a part in your RV breaks but, everything is super expensive at least double what you would pay at your local store. There is a restaurant, I didn't visit. And an amphitheater. The restrooms next to the amphitheater are airconditioned and automatic everything which is really nice. As for the other bathrooms they were clean, always had toilet paper, had mirrors, and not too many bugs. The lake is beautiful! The view of the mountains is breathtaking. The water was super cold but the kids didn't mind. The campsites come with one table, one firepit, and parking for two vehicles.<//Text>

One of my favorite places to go camping! If you love camping as much as I do, then you're constantly trying to get your skeptical friends (who have never gone camping and are scared of the idea to) to come with.

This is the best place to take new campers and then anyone who loves to swim in a lake. The water here can feel cold but it's not nearly as cold as Lake Tahoe. The campsites are not too crowded and everyone is really friendly. Facilites are cleaned frequently too which is nice.

Favorite Activities/Features of Pinecrest:
- Tent camping
- Outdoor movie theatre
- Boat/kayak/canoe rental
- Swimming
- Hiking
- Restaurant
- Grocery store< /Text>

Mark and his team impressed us right from the start.  We are new homeowners and this evening our AC stopped working.  We called A Five Star Heating & Cooling, hoping to get a quote.  They were able to come out to us tonight and within 20 minutes of us calling.  The team was extremely professional, courteous, knowledgeable & friendly through the entire process.  The customer service offered was fantastic, the quick reply and timely appointment, ease to work with and value received were beyond expectations.  We really did get lucky working with such an amazing team.  I would absolutely recommend Mark and his team at A Five Star Heating and Cooling to all friends, family & anyone else looking for reliable service, affordable rates and stellar customer service.  Thank you so much for taking care of us and helping us settle into our new home!!!<//review>

It was a Sunday and when I called Mark he already had his day planned but he fit me in, Mark kept me informed where and when he would be coming I was already impressed. When he arrived he was very polite, friendly, respectful, and professional. He got right to work he also explained everything to me about the parts and what he was doing he was very knowledgeable, needless to say I’ll be using him again if I need to. His Assistant was also very helpful , respectful and friendly , I felt very comfortable with the both of them. Marks prices were very reasonable. I am so glad I picked them!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

When you call A Five Star Heating and Cooling, that is exactly what you get!  5-Star service!  When we called around noon on Monday, the owner Mark said they were close by and could come over after lunch.  We were very surprised with the reasonable cost of the service estimate.  Much lower than anyone else we had called. Within 45 minutes they arrived and went right to work.  The unit was repaired, cleaned, and recharged very quickly.  We were concerned on how much it would cost, but Mark charged a very reasonable price.  We definitely recommend this company!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have to say this was the fourth AC company I called and by far the best!! First company just gave me a quote for a new AC didn’t try to solve the problem. Second one did some good but month later it wasn’t cooling. The fourth company lied and didn’t want to do anything. Mark with this company was immediately responsive and was honest and truly looked into the system to see if he could get it to work and he did! Highly recommend and they really are a 5 star company with 5 star service. Thank You<//review>< pictures>

My compressor went out during the 100+ heatwave.  Five Star was the only company that picked up my call at 6:45pm.  Mark (owner) answered and was able to get me on the schedule within 36 hrs.  Replaced my capacitor and charged up the R22. Very reasonable prices.  Did not try to sell me a new system, despite mine being ~20 yrs old.  Will be using this company from now on.< /review>

I called him on Saturday because my HVAC unit did not work,and even though he had a day off on Sunday, he still showed up to help me. He is very reliable and his pricing is very reasonable and affordable. He could have charged me a lot more than he did and he also gave me $400.00 discount off my total bill. He is amazing!!!!<//Text>

My unit is still working good and I recommended him to my sister in law. He also had her unit running good in a timely manner. I recommend him to anyone that needs their ac fixed.<//Text>< name>

My man Mark came through the next morning after I called him the previous evening and had my AC blowing cold again by noon. Very professional and punctual. The other places I called said they couldn't make it for a few days because understandably it was the middle of August. But these guys made it happen. As far as I'm concerned there will be no reason to call anybody else!!</text>

I called at 7pm on a Friday night, and Mark answered and scheduled service call for noon on the next day - Saturday.  This is the 4th time that we have used Mark for our very old (1983 original with house) air conditioner.  Our home warranty company said it was dead and needed replacing over 4 years ago.  I call Mark for second opinion, and he got it running again in one visit.  It has had some issues, but he manages to help get it back working each time.  I know it will need replacing soon - but so grateful that Mark is willing to keep working and fixing it, so that we are not out of pocket the enormous bill for a whole new unit.  Fast response, reliable, and very nice.  Highly recommend him - honest guy, willing to save you money instead of sales pushing new unit.</text>

Mark Sanders and Brandon came out with in a few hours (they called 30 mins before arriving-(I loved that). They were quick, fast and the price was reasonable compared to the other companies we looked at (who was scheduling 2 days out).  They didn't even mind the dog being around them and they were extremely nice and they kept us informed during the repair process. They also alerted us to potential future issues. We will definitely use them again.<//review>

<review>We contacted A Five STAR on the recommendation of a friend. We were pleased to get a quick appointment and super pleased that the service rep. fixed our a/c in short order.  The service rep.Mark, was very knowledgeable of the equipment and methodically diagnosed the problem with our older unit. Their price was very reasonable too! We could not be more pleased with the service and would not hesitate to recommend A Five Star Company to our family and friends.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>Mark and his team are so great to work with. They're punctual and work hard to get the job done as soon as possible. Our air suddenly stopped working and Mark was able to come out first thing in the morning to diagnosis the problem. Not only was he able to diagnosis and quote what the issue was, him and Brandon (?) got it done super fast after. Mark also gives tips on what you should do to improve your heating and air system without charging you more money for him to do it. I would definitely recommend A Five Star to anyone who needs service!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Mark was prompt, polite and professional. I scheduled an AC inspection with him and he put me on his schedule immediately. He arrived on time and called ahead to let me know he was on his way. Mark was thorough and showed me some tips on how to best maintain my AC unit to save on electricity cost. It was refreshing to find someone who was interested in helping me save money instead of trying to sell me more. I will definitely be using A Five Star exclusively for my AC service from now on. I highly recommend Mark!<//Review>

<Review>This company was amazing. And very professional with reasonable prices. I called three companies one failed to keep the appointment. Another came and told me I needed a new unit and quoted me $9000. They said it could not be fixed.  Then 5 start came out they worked with my time off. My air was fixed in literally 30 min.  The workers was amazing. Highly recommended this company< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Hard to find people who treat customers correctly today. But with Mark at AFiveStar that's exactly what you get. Easy to contact and schedule, clear  & precise communication of when, what  and cost's. Courtesy call before coming to let you now he's on the way. He even got here sooner than expected( bonus). Took care of my old 30 year unit and it's performing like a champ again. He even threw in some freebies!!! The best part is he tells you what has to be done now and what possibly will be needed in future to keep the unit operating. No pressure, honest, reliable service.  I don't usually do reviews but when you find the rare good one you want others to know. Yes we have the last name, but not related and never met him before. Real customer review A++ Thanks Mark</Review>< pictures>

I can't express how much I appreciate A Five Star Company. We have had them come out to both my work and to my parents house in the middle of scorching hot days which I know is a busy season. They came out both times the same days that I had to call them. They were prompt, courteous and wonderful to work with. Not to mention got the air conditioning units working both times the same day. Thank you so much, I will recommend your company to everyone I know and work with!< /Review>

Mark actually answered my call at 6pm on Sunday evening (7/8). He came out as promised on Monday and fixed the problem right away. Gave us a great price and was very nice. Also gave us helpful suggestions for upkeep on the unit. Highly Recommend!<//text>< GmapID>

<review>A FIVE STAR COMPANY arrived very promptly and immediately began performing an extensive service on our ac/furnace. We hadnt had a regular service for 3+ years. We received other quotes from companies who were 2 weeks out, and A Five Star Company Heating and Cooling came out the next day! These guys went above and beyond for us. Great work very professional and a great price as well! Mark is an Air conditioning magician! Thanks A Five Star Company!</review>< pictures>

We just had Mark and his team service our AC unit and he did an outstanding job!  He and his team are very knowledgeable and honest. If you place great value on a company’s work ethic and integrity, give Mark a call. He will definitely get my business again in the future.</text>

First I would give Mark and A Five Star Heating and air a 10+ rating.
Over 5 years ago my air conditioner stopped working. I called 3 companies in all.. 2 were the big name companies. they said the unit was not fixable.  They they proceeded to try and sell a new unit for over$8,000.  That's when they started the hard sell like a used car salesman.

Then I got a call back from Mark, he said he could be at my house in 20 minutes.  When he arrived it only took him 5 minutes to figure out what was wrong.  A bug had gotten into the unit a fried the connector.  He even knew that I had a collapsed air duct without even going into my attic... Amazing!!!  Because it was true. It only cost $600 and no need for a new unit.

Now fast forward to today... My unit wasn't working so I called Mark again.  This time there were multiple parts that need to be replaced for a total of $1950.00, which includes a new thermostat. He said that once it's fixed it would be a "new" air conditioner and that I wouldn't have to spend thousands on a new unit.
Mark and the company are the best at what they do and I will be a life long customer.  Mark, YOU ROCK!!!!!!!< /Text>

My AC unit stopped blowing cool air and of course right before my family was coming to stay with us for the week of 4th of July. Mark, the business owner, came out the same day. Did a thorough check to diagnose the issue. He was talking me through every step to make sure I knew what I am paying for and just to understand why the unit was malfunctioning, which I greatly appreciate. Another thing, which is minor but stood out to me, I had informed him that we don't wear shoes inside the house. Without hesitation, he removed his shoes, several times while going in and out of the house. In the past I had workers telling me its a "safety concern" so I REALLY appreciated him respecting my home. Definitely will be calling him again , but hopefully not anytime soon haha<//review>

<review>A co worker of mine refereed me to A Five Star Company. I was nervous because everyone was telling me my unit needed to be replaced and it was going to cost a lot of money, but Mark came over and within 10 minutes he found what was broken, replaced it and now its purring like a kitten. Thank you! I highly recommend this Company.<//review>< user_id>

Mark did a great job servicing our AC. Super quick response, made an appointment for the next day (!), showed up on time, professional and funny to boot. Serviced our two units, found faulty condensers and added freon. We asked about adding additional ducting in our master bedroom, and when he quoted it he told us we could probably get it done for less! But we hired him anyway, he was that good and we trusted him. Second day on site went well, unexpected length for the new ducting. I offered to go get the materials for them if they'd stay to get the job done...which they did! I'm now loving my "chill" house so much that I may go get a sweater just to bask in all the cool air. Highly recommend Mark and will keep him on my go-to list!</Text>

I had two other services look at it before and they all just said the familiar (and lazy): "...that's an old new unit and you need a new one. It's destroyed." But Five Star actually found the problem and fixed it....and fast. I have been using them to gradually rebuild all the system. Also...very rare...the owner always answers his phone, or calls you back promptly, personally! That's really helpful. I highly recommend them!</Text>< Pictures>

Marc is honest, reliable and fairly priced.  He is the only person I will call for hvac, AC issues.
I was told by a family friend that I needed a whole new AC unit. I called Marc for a 2nd opinion. He had us back with a working AC unit in minutes and at a fraction of what I was being pressured for by "the other guys."<//Review>

<review>This review is much overdue.... Mark did a great job repairing our AC unit.  Last summer I went out of town to Vegas for an event and of course, the one time I actually go out of town, my darn AC unit went out and my boyfriend was left stranded in the scolding hot house.  It was in the middle of the summer and awfully uncomfortable in the house. We were referred to A Five Star Company by a family friend and Mark came out and repairs our unit.  We will use them again in the future if we ever have AC problems again!</review></record></dataset><record>

This is the 1st massage place that I go to and I have to pay before hand. I had to tell the lady twice to focus on the area that had my stress balls and had to tell her twice that the pressure was too hard. And she a whole bunch of oil and she was just to harsh for me. I will go back but will not go with her.< /Text>

<Text>Amazing service!! I absolutely love this place ! My go-to when I’m in serious need. My favorite is the #9 foot and body massage combo. Clean and private settings. Relaxing and quiet. All ladies are great. My only recommendation is don’t come too late sometimes girls are exhausted and you can tell in massage performance. Also they kinda force you to tip. I’m not saying the ladies don’t deserve it just sometimes it’s not with in budget . I am a chronic pain and fibromyalgia patient and it’s a medical necessity to get massages sometimes all I have is the money to pay for the massage and when they say oh no tip or when you go to tip and they ask for more it’s unprofessional in my opinion.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Massage is good but I didn’t like how they demanded a tip even before the massage was done, I said I would do $5 and the guy in the front said “can you do more than that” he took the liberty to take $10 from the $50 I gave him .. SMH</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The person that I use for message happened to be late that day. The other ladies approached me and asked me to Pre-pay before the service was given. I objected and within a few minutes the person that I use came in. I always use Jimmy and He is wonderful. One day, Jimmy wasn't there. I gave one of the other ladies a try. $20 message over clothing for 30 minutes. I was very dissatisfied with her. She purposely was rough with her massage. She would stretch the skin around my eyes as hard as she could. I feel that she was retaliating for  standing up to her the day she asked me to Pre-pay and I refused. I am addimate now  about using Jimmy and nobody else<//text><name>Katie Mac</name>< resp>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Please don't go here. The masseuse I had sucked. He had no technique, did not remove ANY knots you're not fully covered during the massage. I felt too exposed and I also felt that he didn't know that there are certain areas of your body he is not supposed to touch. He didn't respect my privacy. The masseuse picked up the phone as he was massaging me and scheduled appointment right on my massage table. At least leave and take the call outside. There are a lot of cheap, quality massage places, but this one is not it.
I felt like I paid $40 for some stranger to just dump gallons of oil on my body.   Save your money and just have your boyfriend/girlfriend do it. This place is Not worth it.<//text>< date>

This was my place to go when i needed a massage but Not anymore! I felt so humiliated after they told me my tipping is not enough for their services. Since when is tipping an obligation! I gave $10 tip for both me and my mom and they asked if i can leave $5 or $10 more tip since it was two of us, the man in front said that the massage ladies weren't going to like that amount so to leave at least $15. I told him tipping is not an obligation and at least I'm tipping, theirs a lot of people who don't. If they didn't like it I'll just find someone else who can offer the service without expecting me to tip what they want. He said is fine i can do that. What they don't know is my whole family comes to this location and i would even buy Christmas gift cards for others, for $5 dollars they had lost many customers (my family and I). People suppose to come distress themselves here not encounter this type of disappointments and embarrassments in front of other people. I will be taking my business somewhere else!</review>

<review>I hated this place already because during my massage the girls would talk and laugh while I'm laying there trying to relax and they got made when I gave them a $5 tip. One girl literally followed me out saying something in Chinese very angry. A guy had to come out and pull her back in. I got a gift certificate so I made an appointment for a 30 minute massage. When I got there they said I'd have to wait 2 hours! That is ridiculous! I will never come to this place!!! They are rude here!!</review><gmap_id>0x80c2d2d1f566f659:0x6d41cb6341a393e9</gmap_id><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

Went with some real bad pain and they charged me 40 dollars for a one hour massage and only worked on my back for 30 minutes and said that was it when i told them they acted like i was crazy an refused to give me half my money back. Cursed at me when i wouldn't tip them. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE DRIVE A LITTLE MORE IF YOU HAVE TOO!!!!!!!!!!!<//review>

<text>I've always loved this facility...clean, spacious and beautiful. But what I truly appreciate is the professionalism and kindness of the staff. They have especially shone during the year of the pandemic. I always drop in, and they always find me a lane. They're always positive.  There are not enough superlatives. Thanks to you all.< /text>< userid>

<text>At the facility for the Cross-Fit games. Facility is very nice. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Stayed at the hotel across the street. I heard a spin class at 5:30am.  That's early. Parking lot is usually packed when open. Must be popular.<//text>< Pictures>

This is a great Aquatic place.   It has Children splash area, a toddler water feature structure/ Slides, a warmer large instructional pool, and a separate training pool.  Finally it has two muti-story slides for 48" and larger people.  One is fast and other has more curves.

Fairly packed on weekends, and Summer early days.  Food onsite, Cabana rentals, and party rentals.  Pinic area, which are hard to get.   No BBQ area, but you can order BBQ items from thier menu.  All chairs, pinic area, and grass area are a first come first get.

The Life guards seem to be good and attentive.  Always could be better, but a good place to let your kids escape the hot days of Summer!< /Text>

One of the many advantages of living in Morgan Hill!    The MH Aquatic Center has something for every age and aquatic interest.  Lap pool, dive pool, recreation pool, kiddie pool, water slides and play structures. She spots can be reserved, otherwise, you need to get here early in the summer to find shade.  Food service and BBQ is often available.<//Review>

<Review>It's a great place for the little ones not recommended for teens as the place is more for 11 years oldcand younger. My son is 3 and he loved it. You can not take an ice chest or any form of glass inside but you can take snakes and water/juice.  Gets packed fast.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Plenty of attentive lifeguards & areas for small kids, big kids, & adults. I wish there was more shaded seating, but my 2-year-old son loved exploring all of the water features so we didn't spend much time out of the water! & the water wasn't too warm or too cold 😎

If you want to lock up your stuff in one of the lockers instead of leaving it sit somewhere, you'll need to bring your own lock or buy one there for $5.
You can bring in snacks & baby food, but no glass containers or hard coolers. They also have food you can purchase (like a $6 burger 🍔, $5 nachos, $3 corn dog, $2.75 soda, $1 bottled water, $1-3.50 ice cream, etc.).

Kids under 4 have to wear a disposable swim diaper (available to purchase there for $2) & a reusable swim diaper/liner (available for $4) under their swimsuit.

Overall, good, cool, safe fun for kiddo + mom & auntie! 😁

Admission without a membership is as follows (resident/non-resident):
Under 2 years = free
2-11 years = $7/$11
12-17 years = $9/$13
18+ years = $12/$16< /review>

Worse experience for CUSTOM SWIMMING LESSONS.  I paid the additional fee to set the private swimming lessons around my schedule that did not occur.  I showed for my second scheduled private lesson at 11:00 only to be told the private lesson was not available. Spoke with Angela only to be told she was only a swimming instructor coordinator and did not schedule the private lesson appointments. Appointments would need to be scheduled directly with the swimming instructor.  I explained that is exactly what I had done, I had scheduled second private lesson with the swimming instructor. I then was told by Angela the instructor is a part-time employee and had already maximized her hours.  I would need to schedule the remaining lesson the following week. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF CUSTOM SWIMMING LESSONS? A very dissatisfied customer.  I would not recommend nor will I return as customer for any type of lessons with Aquatic Center.<//review>

<username>Jo Rhett<//username><date>1345925691785</date><rate>3< /rate><Text>The idea is fantastic. But they have stupid "safety" policies that aren't. For example, only one person can be on a 4 person wide staircase at a time. No, not single file, not one person per level--one person on the entire three story staircase at a time.

They have two completely separate tubes that dump out in two different areas, but only one person in either tube at a time. No, not one person in each tube--one person down at a time at all.

You are not here to enjoy the pools. With the 20-30 minute wait to do anything, the stupid policies make that impossible. You are just here to eat the overpriced food.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Oh my God,horrible line,and I was there last week all I wanted was fresh fruit and i had to wait 2hours in line,I wish the fresh fruit was outside by the grill again,who ever time the fresh fruit back in should be ashamed,the fruit  should be outside that way everyone knows there's Mexican corn,fresh fruit,pina loca,amazing but now it's horrible please put the fresh fruit back out side by the grill were everyone will see how good and sweet it is😊. (At least someone agree with me please)< /Review>

<Review>I was so surprised how really great my prime rib was.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Most of us ordered off the early bird menu which is before 6:30.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>great hang out great service food is usually great however i got Lasagne recently and didnt care for much at all i did explain to waiter one more thing the mashed potatoes are best without the gravy.
in fact the gravy kinda destroys them. otherwise i tried most ther other dinners and so far they were great.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>Man I've driven by this place a thousand times and assumed a lot but I never decided to try it except recently since dining in is limited, but the outdoors seating made it hard to ignore. Well to my great surprise THIS PLACE ROCKS from the prices, menu selection, and best of all the quality of the dishes! We had lunch and my son says the steak sandwich was the best sandwich he's ever had. I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables and a bowl of clam chowder. Definitely going to be a frequent flyer and recommended to everyone.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1614458322808< /Time><username>Claude AC< /username><Rating>5< /Rating>< GmapID>

<text>Update: 07.11.2020,
Best outdoor dining on route 66. Amazing everything.  Keep this set up going forever!

Past review:
The restaurant is amazing!  Please don't go.  I like it easy to get a table and the place mostly to myself.  The early bird specials are the best deal and quality in town! I can't remember the time I've had as good if service.  Thank you Jessica.

Cocktails are proper too!

Nothing leftover...</text>< GmapID>

<Text>Wife and I went to enjoy some comfort food. Service was slow at the beginning.  Once we got our food. Service definitely improved. Wife ordered the sirloin steak. I ordered the ground sirloin steak. Both steaks came with roasted veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. All of it was wonderful. Oh! I ordered a bloody mary. A little strong on the vodka, but thats ok 👌 🙂.<//Text>< Rating>

Been here quite a few times for lunch, dinner and just to stop in for live music and drinks!
The happy hour and early bird specials are great!
Food is good along with service and an old school atmosphere.
Stop in for Wine Wednesday's! 1/2 off bottles of wine.
Love this place!</Review>

I would like to say thank you to our server, Samantha and Bernadette.  Both ladies were super friendly, courteous and helpful.

I took my honey to celebrate his birthday at the Continental.   The menu for lunch is great.  You can have appetizers, sandwiches or lunch entrees.

Honey had a lamb sandwich with onion rings.  This lunch was $11.  I had the prime rib with potatoe salad, veggies and clam chowder.  There are other selections to pick from.

The prime rib ($15) and clam chowder was great.   They also have chicken, salmon, ribeye steak.

They have a main dinner room and a banquet room besides the bar area.   You can enjoy the dining in the bar side too.

Fridays and Saturdays, they have live bands so it gets crowded.

I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.   Thank you Samantha and Bernadette for making our dining experience wonderful.<//text>

I stayed away from this restaurant for years, and I really regret that now. The food is delicious and the drinks are AMAZING. I got a prime rib and let me tell you, it was great. It might not be the best I've had, but I'm also comparing it to a much more expensive steak. For the price, you really really can't beat it. And the drinks were stiff.

The staff was very friendly and I have no complaints. They offered to make my very strong drink weaker, but there was no way I was going to let them do that.

The environment and ambiance itself was nice. It's dark and it is reminiscent of an old school bar. But don't let that deter you, it's a great place to go. The booths are comfortable and the music was good.

Overall, this is a great place to go. I'd highly recommend it.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Wonderful!  Not too many places you see lamb shanks.

Crab cakes were wonderful and not small portions at all.  Lobster was great and barley soup wonderful as well.

I was surprised about the music playing.  It was some radio station that caters to teenagers.  This means horribly loud commercials and lots of them.  Not conducive to having a wonderful meal.  I asked Rena if it could be changed and she said no she did not have control over it.  Management should reconsider.  No music at all would have been better.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Good food, large portions, good service, nice waitresses and good prices.  "Ambiance" is a bit drab...but I like the place. I've had the Prime Rib, Salmon and Rib Eye dinners...all very good.  Has a old fashioned coctail bar next door (attached) and a large party room on the other side...for those special occasions.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3262fbc3465f9:0x33fe15736694dc42< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We went to this Quaint restaurant and the food was excellent. It was quiet and very romantic. The Waitresses were great and we wanted for nothing. I love the ambience at this place and I highly recommend it for a romantic date.< /text>

When you see this place from the outside, you’d think it was a hole in the wall, throwback to 1970s. While the decor is screaming 70s, the service is great; their food is delicious; and, they typically have a great band on Friday nights!< /text>

<review>A surprisingly impressive restaurant. Granted, looks are dated, but the food is excellent! The bar side is well priced and a lot of fun. They have bingo, stand up comedy, and karaoke nights. Love this place. One thing though for new comers, beer is bottle only. Nothing on tap.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Best crabs in town, and I don't mean the seafood ;) The cougars are always on the loose in this place during "Nappy Hour." The beautiful scent of low tide on the wharf just makes you prime for hunting "pelt." Leave your coat at the door, but bring your Brute aftershave, the dames love that, especially the ones born during the Nixon administration (  . Y .  ) Try the "Fuzzy Lap Flounder" or the "Bearded Clam", the waitresses serve it room temp out in the parking lot in an abandoned 82' Powder Blue Buick Skylark.< /Text>

<name>KELLY MOULTON</name><Review>This bar takes you back to when  tuck and roll naugahyde booths and stiff drinks were the norm. Live bands on Friday and Saturday start playing at 9:00.  It's can get really packed on the weekends. There's a restaurant on the other side of bldg that is very dated, but steak dinners are inexpensive.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Darn! :-( Haven't had a meal here since the early 90's, parking lot was packed (everyone must have been in the bar), the restaurant was a ghost town.... Not a soul.... no staff not a single customer. I spy a note saying " ring bell for service". I did ring bell as instructed, waited approximately 5 minutes for someone anyone to appear, and it never happened! So we turned around, walked out, and drove to Outback. Got to say, I was really looking forward to some traditional Basque food. Hope to have better luck next time. :-(</text>

The unique part about this joint is that it has the distinction of being a DIVE Bar and a DIVE Restaurant! Der Weinersnitzel is more Basque restaurant than The Continental!</Review>

The service in the bar is lacking after first round we had to go to the bar and get our own drinks. The first night we were there karaoke was good but this night the KJ's boyfriend was in the audience and she would literally run from the stag to his booth after each song had started all night long. Not the way to run a show.< /Text>

Yee haw. There's good people watching to be had at the Continental restaurant. For being part of a Basque restaurant, the bar has a distinctively American feel. The antler chandeliers demand you dress up for this scene. Put on your best NASCAR shirt, run a comb through that old beard and come on down to enjoy some live music with your homies. Though the standing room is limited and the bar gets packed fast, it's an experience you have to try at least once.<//Review>

<review>Thanksgiving dinner was great,. Food and service were both better than I expected on such a busy day.  Been to buffets that were twice the cost and I was underwhelmed.  The Continental totally impressed me and the rest of our party.

I just wanted to give a shout out to Reyes who helped me out last night just before closing time. He was extremely helpful and is a true asset to your company. If you are in management at the Watsonville location, please make sure and commend Reyes for his excellent work ethic.< /review>

There is a lot to like about Home depot. Hoods ,exhaust fans, vent kits, switches, breakers even a contactor. Only category missing is 3 phase equipment. From conception of the project to planning then the online search that will take you to the exact shelve where the part is you need to find. Self checkout and your gone . Easy, fast ,efficient and with good prices on quality parts, Home depot will provide the necessary parts and accessibility you need to turn a profit! ReVent is a amazing fan/light combo, extremely fast and easy install with also being a quality product<//text>

What can I say. Its home depot. They have stuff. The staff tries but lacks friendliness and professionalism. You have hunt a worked down if you need help. They can see you reaching high places and still wont offer help. They pass by like they are hanging out at the park.<//Text>

Hiya yall,

Just wanted to take some time and give a shoutout to the plumbing department at this Home Depot. Very knowledgeable group of men and women. I always leave satisfied! I wanna single out George who always goes above and beyond to help me with my house's never ending plumbing needs. Always has a smile on his face and a go get em attitude. Thank you all so much. Hope to be there soon for a new shower head health permitting.<//text>

I love Home Depot it got four stars due to some employees have absolutely no common household knowledge. I always get exceptional  help from the seasoned employees. The younger ones usually have very little to No knowledge of anything and seem to be annoyed when you ask them for help. Seems as if their there for a paycheck only. Truth be told I try and not even look at the employees for help.<//text>

Do not order online!!
If you order online order to pick up yourself, if you order delivery and it does not arrive they will not help you at all. Customer service actually went as far as ending the conversation abruptly after they were unable to provide the terms detailing what they were telling me. I thought delivery would be a convenience and it has turned out as anything but. Customer service honestly sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen just terrible.< /Text>

I am constantly going into home Depot to buy a tool when I need it I prefer home Depot over Lowe's for one  it carries Milwaukee products and Lowe's doesn't. I would give it five stars except I can never find Flathead drill bits to put in my impact drill or hammer drill. I don't know why they don't carry it but it's something I guess they never have.</Review>

Often they have most of what you need.  To save money and improve service they really should disconnect their phone system. It's certainly of no use to clients.  The employees could then free up their time for other tasks. Should you have a question about a product, an employee might be able to read a label for you.<//Text>

Most every time I need an orange shirt they are heading the opposite direction and once I finally find one, they tell me that it's not their area.  Customer service has suffered through this pandemic at home depot< /review>

<Text>This is one of the better Home Depot . Still some shady cats in the parking lot..
and it's great if you don't have to talk to anybody that works there because most of the people that work there probably should not..

this is a little bit smaller home Depot but it's extremely well organized The staff is super knowledgeable about where everything is and actually will help you in like most situations where you need to find a tool or supplies I definitely would recommend this as one of the better home depots around I definitely plan on buying more stuff from here<//Text>

<text>Please when you go to home do have your list ready and don't expect any help from the youngsters as they all hang out together.  Worst customer service ever,  the clerk was on her phone on a personal call.  So, I told her to cancel the transaction and left the store.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN HOME DEPOT.  Go to the home depot in Capitola instead everyone is super friendly and helpful.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>I like this store best for construction, irrigation, and what I call "Big Project" items.  Being in Watsonville they cater more to a trade/contractor audience, versus some of the other hardware stores that are more focused on the home repair/improvement buyers.  The one thing about this Home Depot that's a problem is (and I know this isn't their fault) that Verizon Wireless has REALLY BAD coverage inside the store, so if I want to use my Home Depot app it doesn't work.  They supposedly have AT&T Wi-Fi in the store, but the login page never loads.<//text><time>1598057760136<//time><resp>None</resp>< UserId.>

80-90% predictable.  Has most of the same stuff as most of the stores, and the same ok to indifferent employees.  If you're savvy about what you need and it's a fairly common item, you can probably find it at a more-or-less competitive price.  Don't bet on accurate advice, or even location information ("I don't work in that department...")
Open early 7 days a week and easy returns are a plus.  Lack of deep stock on any item, and inaccurate re-stocking/shelf clean-up means a better than 25% chance of incorrect items in open boxes, and returned items re-shelved with missing parts.  As a trade professional I basically use them when I have to, not because I want to< /Text>

Sadly the garden center didn't have what I wanted which was bamboo stakes and mulch that is not died. They do have  the mulch at the Soquel store so I'll have to go there.</text>

Worst Home Depot I have ever been in. The young gals spend more time on their cell phones or talking to the young guys in the store. They seem to get annoyed when you bother them for help. The isles are clogged with stuff so very difficult to navigate a shopping cart. Forget about loading help, nowhere to be found when needed. The panel saw has a blade that has not been changed since the turn of the century. Rather go to Ace or a local lumber yard. Update! Had to go back yesterday (Nov. 2). Asked three times for help at the panel saw, Associate finally showed up with a real attitude. Pushed the plywood so fast through the saw the edges were all splintered. Never said a word to me even though I said thank you twice to him.  I am now going to do all the shopping I can for hardware and tools on Amazon. This Home Depot is the pits.<//review>

<Text>Went early in the morning to get some replacement lights.  Whomever stocked the shelves stuffed the bulb tubes so tightly, they couldn't be removed without assistance.  Found someone after a few minutes if searching and he too had trouble removing the products.  Checkout process is really fast now with each register now capable of doing self checkout.< /Text>< Pictures>

1. Tried to buy a Ring camera doorbell. They have 4 models that are kept locked in a hidden case that you would never find unless you ask. And none of the employees have any knowledge of the product and cannot assist in any way other than to stand guard while you try to figure what model will work best.
2. I absolutely refuse to buy and power tools from from a place that has five cameras constantly annoyingly beeping from every angle while I'm trying to shop. I have no problem paying a few dollars more diwn the street at Big Creek or Lowe's where they don't blatantly treat all of their customers like criminals.</text>

Customer service was horrible there was no one else in the return line however I had to wait 15 minutes before even being acknowledged by an employee that they would be right with me and then proceeded to wait on someone else before myself.. that's why I personally choose to go to smaller locally owned businesses instead of the larger big-box store their customer service is much better I may have to pay more but the experience is happier..<//text>

Watsonville Home Depot has a good stock of items and materials. Prices are reasonable, and the lumber selection provided variety that I had plenty of options for my project.

Parking is adequate for the store, and staff is both helpful and friendly. I am always pleasantly surprised by my experience at this location.<//Text>

Way to put almost every mom-and-pop hardware store out of business and still hold it down. though it does come out in the form of slack-jaw mouth-breathing employees. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just a little annoying when I'm in a hurry in need of a part, and they're like duh I need to  call somebody I don't know much about this department or I'm new here. My my response to that is to be the best customer employee in other words I hope people all the time when I'm there it's a lot of fun if you make it a game out of it can be a lot of fun I do try to do it in a positive way where the idiot employee and there's always at least one can somehow gain a little  expanded perspective and understand that service is actually a good thing. Do self checkouts are really simple and very well-thought-out I still need help every time I use them but you know it's learning curve thing I was one of those idiots at one point so I can talk about this for anybody who thinks I'm a jerk I love home Depot don't ask me why I'll continue to go to the come out something better and then that puts them out of business little probably them anyway bring themselves out of business and how fascism is lol<//text>

Went to get a ballast for a florescent light that had failed.  Asked 4 sales people where I could find them and the first 3 were goose chases.  I would think that management would provide enough general store training such that all associates could at least call someone for guidance if they do not know when asked instead of just giving a random response to get me out of their hair.</text>

Huge, modern Home Depot.  Parking and parking lot are a little weird, there's clearly a country kind of vibe here at this store.  Stopped in for paint on labor day because we saw the paint sale advertisement on TV.  What the TV commercial doesn't say is you have to mail in a rebate form after paying full price in the store which loosely translates into you can forget about the rebate which they'll lose or deny.... Not falling for that trick again Home Depot.  If you want a basic paint color go to HD Supply, they have very limited basic colors but it's almost half the price.< /text>

I work for The Home Depot,  so I'd hardly call it a visit. I'll be blunt - why, well because I'm old and I can be. I helped open the store in Soquel, California in 2007. Since then, customer service has deteriorated across most segments of retail. Inventory is off on a daily basis. My store (and most HDs) allow dogs. As usual today was clean up on aisle 42. Prices are reasonable, and for those that shop on weekends, you are lucky enough to be surrounded by association such as myself that are or have been in the trades..vs newbies that get their information from the online course material that they are required to take.< /text>

I went on Sunday morning  to get some Staples that I needed I approached one of the three young ladies behind the counter to assist me with finding Staples she said that you cpilcpilc only order them online. That was not the case at all I found the on my own. I don't why home Depot hires lazy and useless people.< /Text>

<review>Awful place to shop. Goods are damaged. Employees are lazy. Service is poor. Store layouts do not make sense. We need a better option. This is a huge waste of resources.

Staff is young and they hang out together vs spreading themselves through-out the store. It's tough to find someone to make a key, unlock the spray paint vault or answer a question.<//text>

Time and Time again this store has the WORST customer service. I honestly can't fathom why anyone shops at this store. The employees do not know where to find anyone, they can never answer any questions and cant even help you out to car. Go somewhere else. Worst Home Depot ever.</review>

<review>I needed some lights   Called Dan at the Watsonville store
he had what I needed I'm now in Utah and shipping was not an option.

I took the SKU and was going to start my own search,  before I could get that done Dan called me to let me know which store near me I should go to, I would find the lights I needed,

Thanks to Dan for going the extra mile to see that I had what I needed     Please let him know he made me a satisfied customer
