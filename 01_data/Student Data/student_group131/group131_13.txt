Staff is wonderful! We arrived, called them that we were there, and a staff member came out quickly and took our dog inside. The Vet came out about 20 min later and provided a detail report about our pup. They are awesome!</review>

I have brought my miniature poodle here for both a dental cleaning and a checkup and have been totally satisfied with the professionalism, communication and care they have given. The vet techs and veterinarians are all top notch and I would recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

Our puppy, Latte, broke her 2 front legs and Dr. Amir performed the surgery for an affordable price.  Other places were asking for over $8,000 for this surgery. I was blessed to have the recommendation from a friend that happens to be a pet foster mom @sketch.pup. You will not be disappointed with Dr Amir’s warm and caring personality!!  He has always listened to my concerns and answered all my questions. We are grateful to him for helping us keep our puppy healthy for many years to come!!< /Text>< Pictures>

The staff here are very cautious which is a good thing. There are signs clearly informing you what to so when you arrive. They came out asked about my concerns. Took my dog inside. They were quick and addressed all if my concerns in a safe and healthy manner. Staff was kind and respectful.</text>

I have been using Pico for almost two years now, to provide care for all my rescue dogs...Saving Imperial Rescue.

Dr. Amir and Dr. Arsalan are two of the most compassionate and caring doctors I have ever had the pleasure to work with; they are polite and kind when dealing with animal owners and rescue volunteers. They actually CARE about the animals, and they want to help make vet care affordable for rescues. I cannot say enough about them; if it weren't for them, I truly would never be able to save the animals that I do.

Dr. Amir has also done some dental and orthopedic surgeries that some other vets may not want to attempt, but rather refer to a specialist. What a HUGE cost savings to our rescue.

As a family run business, they do not gouge their customers, and the fact that they have another office in San Clemente (that is open on Sunday), it allows us to have 7 days a week accessibility to medical care when needed.

If I could give Pico Vet and their staff 10 stars, I would!< /review>

Dr Amir is AWESOME!! He has seen my 2 cats and my dog all who are rescues. Several months ago, my senior Siamese cat had his upper fang tooth digging in gum below causing issues and other vets just wanted to pull the healthy upper tooth and charge me tons $$$ but Dr Amir choose to do something else that made more sense, and so far so good!!

Dr Amir also recently treated my senior blue heeler Angel, for a lump that needed cytology of what turned out to be a lipoma thank goodness! He really cares and is very patient while explaining treatment options & recommendations. He had permission to test all her lumps, however he was honest and determined he didn’t need to do that at this time. I’m grateful he doesn’t do unnecessary things.

I know he has helped many rescue dogs too! I drive to Yorba Linda from Hollywood and Dr Amir is well worth the travel, with reasonable prices and most important to me, genuine care. Thank you Dr! Amir! I’m very grateful. 🙏</Text>

Smelled coming in. Urine on floor. Front desk receptionist rude and unattentive. No greeting or smile or any acknowledgement upon entering. Came from a long drive. Waited for her to get off the long phone call. Asked if I may please use the restroom. She said, "ummm can you just hold it? Because the vet is doing a dental procedure and doesn't look very happy. Upset." Wow, really!?!? Glad I don't need this place for MY pets.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>If I could give -0 stars I would! Heartless, NEGLIGENT, money hungry people! My poor lab has severe ear issues and we need a mobile vet to come out because he tends to be high-strung and too much energy for us to take him in an office with other dogs. When we first inquired with them over months ago, they came out same day, which was great. However, Charlie's ear acts up a few times a year, so we needed them to see him again. We called Pico and their staff stated they were "too busy" to see my dog who is on the verge of popping his ear drum due to the pain and irritation. My mom offered to pre-medicate him due to him being high strong, but they said again they were "too busy". My mom asked for the next available appointment and they would not schedule my dog. Once my mom told me this, I called their office giving a fake story about an old dog who isn't doing so well and needs a home visit. The gentleman on the phone offered the same day visit at 4pm. Utterly disgusted I confronted him, who happens to be the doctor, and asked why this dog could be seen, but why not mine? He instantly knew and said, "Oh Charlie, I already explained to your mom we were "too busy". That's REALLY odd when you can call and make a home visit for a new dog (patient), but deny a current patient. If you have any love for yourself and your dog, I would highly recommend taking them to a place that cares and doesn't coward away from a difficult dog. They could care LESS if my dog punctures his ear because they don't want to deal with him. SHAME ON YOU GUYS! I thought vets had compassion for animals. Where's the compassion here Dr? Unprofessional at it's finest and no sympathy. Just TELL us to move on because you don't have professional staff to deal with dogs like that. Don't just lie BLATANTLY! So irresponsible I can't believe this place.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

There has been no change in the excellent service we received from All About Cats now that the clinic has new owners and is Pico Veterinary Hospital. The staff is still wonderful and caring. The doctors are warm and caring as well and very knowledgeable. They both know our cats' medical histories and explain treatment plans thoroughly. They follow up to see how our furbabies are doing. I recommend this clinic highly, with no reservation.</text>

Dr. Amir is just amazing. We had 2 dog’s knees repaired,  one with the rescue group I am with and one is our son’s dog. Dr. did a beautiful job and both dogs are as good as new! Dr. Amir is so kind and loves to help the animals. What a great vet AND a great surgeon! If you don’t live close he is SO worth the drive!  He also works out of the San Clemente office sometimes as well.  I would refer anyone and everyone to him!< /Text>

I agree with the remarks about both Drs being caring & listening. They also have another office in San Clemente & if you need the Drs on Sunday you might choose to go there.
The clinic also has programs that offer annual check ups, blood tests vaccines, if needed other options all for 1 price, good for 1yr. It's a bargain! It's best to discuss with the doctor just what plan is best for your animal.<//Text>

<Date>1548223242390<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>My chihuahua, Chico was in the best hands yesterday for his tumor surgery. After I found a lump on him a week ago and getting a preliminary "likely mast cell tumor" diagnosis at my primary vet in Huntington Beach, they referred me to a surgical oncologist because they didn't feel comfortable to do the surgery.  The specialist vet estimated close to $10,000 for tests and surgery which was way beyond my budget yet I of course wanted to put my animal's health first so I then went on to get other opinions from 2 more vets and spoke to trusted friends in the rescue and veterinary community, visiting a total of 4 different vets last week to find the best option. Dr Amir Liaghat at Pico was recommended by a rescue friend who works with vets all over OC and had had her own family pet treated for cancer by Dr. Liaghat so I trusted her recommendation to go see him.  Unlike my primary vet, when I first met him, he immediately made me feel comfortable with his ability to handle this surgery because he does a lot of surgeries of this type and was easily able to answer my many questions. I left feeling very confident we were in the right place with the treatment decision. It was a huge plus that Dr. Amir has such a kind and compassionate demeanor. Chico instantly took to him and was so comfortable - which made surgery day a little easier. All of his staff were great, too - so personable and helpful.  btw, post-surgery - his bill was 90% less than the specialist estimate and he was able to get the whole tumor out with good margins - so now we have to wait on the biopsy results. I am grateful to have them caring for my sweetie-pie.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The prices and the service are sufficient for the food quality. This is the spot for all special occasions or a night out of fine dining, unpretentious and eloquent. When quality Italian cuisine and hospitality are required, one can easily become a "go-to" restaurant.<//Text>

<Review>The first thing that came to mind was Jean-Ralphio (Parks n Rec) when I heard "Bel Bacio." But truthfully, I just wanted to find a cafe in downtown San Jose that looked nice and had strong wi-fi (preferably a place I hadn't been to before).

Well, my first impression of Bel Bacio was that it was kinda magical. This was because  Bel Bacio is located in Little Italy (a magical little strip that isn't as interesting as Little Italy in San Diego, but is still special in its own way). Thankfully, there's a good amount of 2-hr (coin) street parking across from Bel Bacio.

Bel Bacio is pretty on the inside, and the employees were both warm and helpful.

I got to try their Nutellino (which is basically an espresso shot with a lot of Nutella and creme). Yup. It was marvelous.

This is a great place to study at not only because it's pretty and quiet but also because the seats are pretty comfy.

Note: They also sell food items like panini's here as well as gelato!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6mbW1bV2WRWE1zhccuLTzVoDpHxQPIWhWLXA7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIXmI4HANeZ0x602SDua1RJn_TVnvWb9loovAE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuVZTaB9ebrz0WvcEq55dr4VftilJzltNnNYU6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6xSlQDNzKfieqOWaFfGlyj0VDt6MZd0Rpl9Sf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSKEpOuc5vCoGkP3XYBViGLJroVFyxF0rXRIb2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfNq6ekLVo0FKs1ACVGB_FKbrjbhL5srVQn6aA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtS4L3VvgkKa0JFm8ZxwRpSGPWbO4zyZLwgcXB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8QUpk8mAPcQgWUe5n2djJgtUaQ18ATyywZZAf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3Fh1gZ7tfkUSeb-raTv659B9QBqxwSCer8tTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEPnejEDZtlVgyWSYP-CegPp5juKimrVSD9kbb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The assortment of beverages and food after are all very tasty. This is a very clean coffee shop. It doesn't often get too busy during the day so a good place to get a little work done. Great for a coffee date. This place is a definite place to check out in the downtown area.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4Mikw19X-o7Xf8f4qxQ62gRwtpd7I9QYjD0py=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmz1U5eExmS4bdgn1N5j0IofPlUjDYSYdtr4os=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFGVPtiutXH3DZ16E9rFJfI1XhJJANnQJZQpBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_NAXJMVpc2YvEboI6D22DvhK7ZNZ0-qm_aWXm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Randomly walked in. Nice, comfortable atmosphere. Ended up getting a slice of lasagna and calzone and loved it. Will come back again to try the desserts and coffee.<//Text>

Great variety in drinks and prices were as expected. The vibe of this place is so relaxed and easy going. Outdoor seating has nice sun and the inside is cozy. The milk with cardamom was delicious and added a unique flavor. Perfect place to sit and read. They also have a cozy fireplace indoors when it is cold out.<//text>

Good Coffee Italian style with nice baked goods and gelato, right in the center of San Jose’s tiny Little Italy zone. Comfy and fun to hang or get some work done.< /Text>

My favorite cafe in downtown San Jose. It's small, very cozy, with a flair that's closer to a living room than to a hectic coffee place, but that's what I love about it. The coffee is great, the paninis tasty and both the staff and owners are amazing.

If you've got a sweet tooth, check out the almond-marzipan sweets!<//review>

Cafe food and the feeling here is very good. I wanted to post a food pic but it looked so good I couldn't stop. Nothing but pleasant experiences here. The bill was fair for the quality of food. Food is like a place in Baltimore I loved.<//text>

So my friend and I took two coffee breaks and enjoyed some delicious iced coffee.   I also tried the iced mocha and was amazed that the chocolate was dark and unsweetened.   I loved it.   Didn't know that this place was there, but now that I do, I will definitely go back!<//Text>< Response>

I met the owners selling their coffee and treats at an event and they suggested I stop by their café to check it out. So I did, on a Saturday afternoon. Bel Bacio is in a cute building, in the San Jose Little Italy area. There are tables in every nook and outside seating available too.

The barista was very nice and made a few suggestions for dessert. We ordered the spumoni, affogato and a few desserts. All was delicious. The affogato was a little on the small side though.
Will definitely visit again.<//review>

<Text>Angel made our coffee and he was nothing less than professional.  The ambiance was priceless.  We walked in 30 minutes before closing and the timing could not have been more perfect.  I visited Italy a few years back; yet today, for just that little moment, it was as if I'd never left!</Text><Date>1559316559369</Date>< name>

The cookies and the coffee are absolutely fabulous. They taste great. The cookies have that better than home made taste, rich, buttery, delicious. Original flavors too. I recommend the almond and apricot cookies. They have a round chocolate shortbread which is not too sweet, perfect with a creamy latte.

Coffee is served in Italian (plus) sizes, so their largest one is smaller than a small Starbucks. Good flavor, beans definitely not burnt. The setting is nice too, very pleasant and cozy.

4 stars instead of 5 because they should have two people working there. We came in one morning and to get our cookies and coffee it took 26minutes. We know exactly because we put 30m on the parking meter and there were 4m left when we came back. That's too long for coffee, I don't think we would come during the week before work but for the weekend to enjoy la dolce vita, it's perfect.</text>

I love finding unique coffee houses and Bel Bacio is my favorite. Great coffee drinks, especially the affogato (gelato and espresso) and nice pastries and snacks. Living room lounge and nice outdoor seating too. Just relaxing and nice to get away from the standard coffee places.<//Review>

<text>Classy! loved the variation in types of coffee drinks!
The place has nice warm home setting. It is not big enough for a large group, but perfect to hangout with your best friend, date or just by yourself (take a book to read). This place is a must try.
Me being a coffee lover, absolutely loved "Shakerato".<//text>< pictures>

I didn't try any food from the menu, but did get an iced coffee called a Shakarino (sp?). It's two expresso shots and simple syrup shaken up in a martini mixer. Then poured into a cup with foam. I had mine over ice so it was super cold. Delicious!
Parking is limited to street parking, and that is usually taken. Expect a walk to get there.< /review>< date>

Warm, intimate cafe in San Jose's Little Italy, on the edge of downtown, located in a renovated old house from the turn of the 20th century. I really enjoy a coffee on their porch.< /text>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>Update: I was very happy with this place before, but sadly today's visit was a huge let-down. The pastries are still good, but 3 bad points:
1. The espresso was anything but. Apparently this barista either has no idea how to make a real one, or didn't pay attention care, but it was a completely watered down coffee, nowhere near an espresso.
2. One of the nutela filled pastries was heated. Problem was, it was over-heated so much, that the filling got burned up and lost it's consistency.
3. When we needed napkins, none could be found. Our table and all those we looked at, had empty napkin containers. So had to go ask the waitress.

Now maybe this is all a fluke - I would try again since they did use to be much better than this. But hope this is not what the new normal is there.

Past review: Top quality espresso and nice Italian pastries.<//Text>< pics>

Stumbled across this cute Italian coffee house on our trip to San Jose.  The coffee shop is in Little Italy in a house. Owner is very friendly. We order one of the specialty drinks, the Cadomocaccino which has cardamom and dark chocolate, I loved the drink and it was nice to sit in this cute house and enjoy the atmosphere. I'm gkad I got to stumble on this during my breif stay in San Jose.</text>

Updating my review because I recently ordered an iced mocha and it was almost just like my first one! Only thing they forgot was the whipped cream on top.

Ordered a Fagotto (a chocolate+custard-filled sugary croissant, which is AWESOME). I asked for it warmed up and, unfortunately, they heated it up in the microwave (-1 points). Gotta toaster oven that badboy! Either way, this is a badass dessert. Love the subtle hint of custard in the filling to compliment the rich chocolate syrup.

Ate the fagotto with a side of the PISTACHIO GELATO. Match made in heaven. It was so good! They need to put more fresh salted pistachios in the gelato, though! I only got like 3 nuts total. I wish I had gotten 30 nuts.

I think I let a few poor experiences resulted in my previously bad review. Overall, though, this place is on point!<//review>

My reason is because as soon as I walk in the staff immediately takes my order and within 5 minutes I'm already out the door. Also their cadre latte and cappuccino are great.</Text>

Best stylist for my hair type, ever! I live in Germany and return to get my hair cut annually by Jo Jo because no other stylist compares. I have extremely thick strong Mediterranean-like hair, which only Jo Jo has been able to cut and style to my satisfaction. Ironically, I would've thought I could find someone in Germany who could cut my hair well due to the large presence of Turkish, Greek, and other ethnicities in the population who tend to have my hair type. But after trying different stylists for ten years, I have yet to find a stylist as close to good as Jo Jo. He is able to thin out my thick hair without making me look like a mushroom cap. I always come out of Jo Jo's studio feeling confident and sexy knowing it will grow out nicely, yet hoping it will last until the next time I return to San Jose. I HIGHLY recommend Jo Jo, his products, and his well run salon for anyone who wants to look and feel good by a professional who wants the same for you because it's his passion and he feels good when YOU do. I will keep coming back for as long Jo continues his art!< /text>

From the moment I walked into this salon I felt at home. The staff was so welcoming and attentive, I had never felt such love while getting my hair done!  I finally knew I found the right hair salon for me.  When I walked in, my hair had previously been damaged and was in need of rescue.  My wonderful hair stylist, Ray, saved by hair from the brink of hell and I couldnt be more impressed by his friendliness and his ability to work miracles.  The cut was excellent and he was able to expertly correct the shape of my hair without taking off too much length. The final color was exceptional and the outcome was better than I had expected given the initial color of my hair.  I recommend this place to literally everyone in my life.</Text>

The hairdresser has worked very hard to make me look better and better. Whatever the treatment is, this is the ideal place to get away from it for a genuine relaxation. The 5-star service will always be provided.</text>

<Review>Love going to JoJo’s hair studio. Very clean and hygienic and they always try to make sure you get the best service. I go to Ray Ray and he is the sweetest. I have gotten hair color, hair cut and even keratin treatment hair and never had any complaint. Definitely recommend it to everyone.< /Review>< pics>

I need to rave about Gaby for so many reasons.  First off all, she's a true creator - I asked for a cut and bayalage, and trusted her with the rest (length, color temperature etc.) Thank goodness I did because Gaby made me feel like myself again, which is amazing even when you don't consider how hard that might be given I'm about to pop with baby number 3 and I had a patch of freshly sprouted covid grays. I could seriously cry! She made my hair so beautiful and made me feel good about myself. On top of that, you couldn't convince me there is a stylist more thoughtful and kind than Gaby. She spent her whole day with me paying attention to every single detail.  I'll never go to another person again.

Every other stylist at JoJos was also thoughtful and kind, I was impressed with their handling of every client that walked in the door.  The salon itself was beautiful and pristine.  It felt so safe and clean and they took care of it meticulously.

I'm the happiest and Gaby and JoJos is the best</Text>

I always leave feeling like a new person.  JoJo has amazing talent and takes his time to give you the cut you deserve.  The establishment and team provides consistent professional and friendly service.  I feel safe and confident with the safety precautions they are taking during this time.< /Review>

<Review>*COVID-19 pandemic review*

It's been about 8 months since my last hair cut with JoJo, so I was so happy he was able to take me for a wash and hair cut on the Saturday during Labor Day weekend (this was right before the county loosened up and allowed 25% indoor services to open). Being five months pregnant, I had been very paranoid and cautious about leaving my house, but I was so relieved to see JoJo take ALL of the precautions to make the experience safe for me and all of his customers. Here's a quick summary of my visit:

- Masks are required to be worn the entire time by the customer and by the stylist

- You fill out a questionnaire about COVID exposure and they take your temperature at the door

- JoJo was frequently sanitizing his hands every few minutes

- His hair cutting station was outdoors on his patio, fully shaded, and he had a fan and air purifier running as well (he told me he after the Labor Day holiday he is allowed to have some stations indoors... which is great because he has 2 rooms in his salon that has big doors that can open up and circulate fresh air)

- His assistant would vacuum cut hair from the floor every few minutes

- Any towels or smocks used for my visit were discarded into a secure covered bin immediately after he was done

- He only took credit card as payment - I wasn't thinking and tried to hand him my CC directly (oops!), but he didn't take it and asked me to insert the card into the chip reader to finish the no-contact payment

I am so happy with my cut. My head feels 10 lbs lighter and for once I was starting to feel some kind of pregnancy 'glow.' I was not able to get my hair colored because of my condition, but what's amazing was the previous colors and highlights he used back in January blended so well with my roots - it's almost as if he designed it so that it could grow out naturally to blend well (minus all the grey hairs)!  I love it.

I am super appreciative of all the steps JoJo and his assistant took to make me feel safe during my visit and am thrilled to be able to support a local business. Even before this pandemic, JoJo had always gone above and beyond to take care of his customers - he's the best at what he does and I will 100% recommend his salon always.<//Review>< username>

I've been on the lookout for a salon in San Jose for quite some time now, and I'm so glad I chose Jojo Hair Studio. I met with Rosa for a haircut and color consultation, and she immediately understood what I was looking for. Couldn't be happier with my haircut and can't wait to go back for my color appointment!

Had a great haircut at Jojo Hair Studio with Nina! She fixed the shape of my hair from my previous bad haircut (not at Jojo's) and knew what to do with my curly/wavy hair...so many hairstylists don't, sadly. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. The location is spacious and clean. I appreciated the provided smock to avoid getting the bits of hair in my clothing. I'll be back!!</review>

I went a first time for a big change in hair ( color + cut) and wasn’t fully happy with it. Ray Ray spent a lot of time fixing it to make sure I loved it. It’s great for once to find a place that really cares about their client and dedicate so much time making sure they really love their new hairstyle. Thanks a lot both Ray Ray and Jo for your time, I really love my new hair :)< /review>

Professionalism and style! I am glad I found Jojo’s hair salon. The hairstylists always ensure that only the most appropriate procedures are done unto your precious strands. I love Ray-Ray and Rosa! The other stylists seem very interesting as well (I’ve seen their clients and the fabulous results) and of course there’s JoJo - the head guru! I appreciate the hospitality here, however, above all it’s all the love that’s given to your hair that makes you go back again and again! I’m worth it and so is every hair on my head!👏🏼 👏🏼💇🏽‍♀️💇🏻‍♂️💆🏽‍♀️👏🏼👏🏼< /Text>

<Text>Well, where to start? From the minute I entered JoJo hair salon, I felt that’s gonna be my place to go from now on!! A very cozy cute place, they listen to all your concerns and needs and most importantly they are so informative. I booked my appointment with Heath and he is perfect and smart. Heath gave me a beautiful cut and styled my hair professionally unlike most of the places I have been to here. Will definitely be back whenever I have something or need a new cut or color!

<response>None</response><Text>I enjoyed every bit of my haircut and every moment I spent in this Salon. Everyone is so amazing, they make you feel like a princess. As soon as you enter they give you a tour of the salon and introduce you to everyone. Jo Jo talks to you about the haircut you want and what would suit you. After which you are pampered with a nice hair wash and massage. Then Jo Jo starts his work. He is an artist, you must let him do what he thinks is right. You would end up with amazing results. And that's not all they click pictures of you before and after the haircut in their studio. They make you pose in all different angles. You feel like your in some photo shoot. Everyone should go once just for the experience. Awesome place. Will surely visit again.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<review>When you get to my review you must have read tons.  I bet all are five stars like mine.  There’s a reason why Jojo’s studio got 5 comparing others.  I was lucky that JoJo took care of my hair.  JoJo is not a simple hairstylist but an artist!!</review>< Gmap_id>

<Response>None< /Response><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Bad hair cut.....
My haircut in JOJO studio is absolutely terrible. Address is 672 N 1st St, San Jose, CA 95112
Before the haircut, I showed the picture of how I wanted my hair to look after the haircut.
After the haircut, it wasn't even remotely close. I was helped by the person name Jojo.
Way too expensive.... Crazy
In the beginning, I purposely told the JOJO I want layers but I don’t see any layers... it was very bad experience I felt.... after spending $100 plus just for hair cut.
I will never recommend anyone to visit here.< /review><userid>116383138677835018782</userid><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1564111965935</Date><user_name>Nitu Jaiswal<//user_name><gmapID>0x808fcc8257931715:0x535807486ea09b6b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amazing salon! I got a foot of my hair cut off and my stylist Marcy gave me her insight on what cut and style would be the best for me. I am in love with my new length and style!

The salon itself is beautiful and the entire staff is warm and welcoming.

You'll definitely love this place! I know I did. I already have my next appointment booked with the wonderful Marcy.< /text>

JoJo is the most professional and artistic hairstylist that I have in America. His cutting techniques are the best. He is patient and knows exactly what his customers want.

Everyone is extremely friendly. The studio’s environment is super clean and comfortable.</Text>

<text>I've seen Jo Jo twice, and he has been on point with my hair style. He's very detail oriented and adds creative touches I love; always listens to what you want and delivers a beautiful cut. I would highly recommend Jo Jo and this salon. It's conveniently located, has great parking in the back, the atmosphere is modern, bright and comfortable, and you'll get served tea or coffee in a beautiful cup and saucer set with a biscotti. Priced moderately for services.<//text>< pics>

My experience at JoJo Hair Studio was absolutely outstanding. The entire time I was there I felt so comfortable, like I was part of a caring, kind, and warm family. I have been dreading going to the salon due to my past experiences at other salons, but JoJo hair studio changed that. Now I can’t wait to go back! Ray Ray was the stylist that took care of me, and I can not recommend him enough. He’s absolutely fantastic and so knowledgeable and attentive. My hair looks out of this right now, I’ve literally never liked how my hair has looked as much as I do right now. The owner, JoJo, is so sweet and pleasant. He’s so bright and happy! He noticed I had been there for awhile (I was doing bleach and color so I was there for ~5 hours) and he offered me something to eat. He went in the back and returned with a beautiful bowl of chopped fruit for me! Outstanding!! I will never forget how well I was treated there, look no further for your salon. This is it.<//Text>

<Text>Great atmosphere at Jojo Hair Studio. My whole family has there hair done by Nina. She is an expert when it comes to hair. My husbands hair grows at different angles. It's very hard to find the right stylist that can cut his hair properly. She's great with my 2yr old son. He has his fathers hair. I finally had my chance to do something special to my hair. She did an excellent Cut and Color with my hair. I definitely recommend checking it out for yourself.<//Text><rating>5</rating></record>

< review>
I've been going to Jo Jo's for over two years now and Amy is my hairdresser. The Salon is a beautiful place, serene in spite of the occasional bustle of customers coming and going. It is spotlessly clean. And there is the resident dog- Faye. She is a sweetie. If you give her a treat she'll remember this forever and trot up to for another : ) If you have severe allergies this may not work since Faye is the resident dog. She belongs to Jo Jo and frankly got there first.

I have managed to get a few cuts at some amazing hair salons. But at Jo Jo's the hairdressers takes the time to work with your hair (my hair was a mess, absolutely horrid - lots of chemical damage, very dry. It would lift up on a windy day and I would suddenly be sporting the tumbleweed look). Between, the cutting and a barrage of very high quality  products matched to my hair, it grew tamer.  Now, Amy's aesthetic  eye and  fine cuts can be seen  and my neighbors all look forward to my hair cuts to see Amy's latest work. Comments like "you look so cute!" are routine. Amy and I treasure "You look glamorous".</review>

Love JoJo! From the moment you walk in - you are greeted with a smile and the ambience of the whole place is very welcoming. You can clearly see that for everyone who works here, they just don't work together, they are family. Aside from everyone, I really love how JoJo just transforms my hair and you feel totally brand new. JoJo has a way of looking at you and then knowing what to do with cut, color and everything.</review>

I felt very welcome as soon as I walked in! I was greeted by the salon owner JoJo. He is the sweetest! I liked that even though he was with a client he took the time to acknowledge me and provide me the forms I needed to fill out as a new client.  My stylist RayRay is awesome! He really took the time to show me around and made me feel comfortable.  He’s very knowledgeable and created a plan to restore my hair to a healthy status. I look forward to continuing my hair care here! Highly Recommend JoJo Hair Studio< /text>

<name>Theresa Palmer< /name><Review>Jojo is the ultimate stylist and artist, he's not satisfied with what he designs until it's perfect. That makes for a fantastic haircut and keeps you coming back forever. My color artist Heath is also amazing and fun. He knows his craft to perfection and isn't afraid to mix it up a bit and give me a new look when it's needed.
The bottom line is I've never had a disappointing experience at JoJo's - and I've been going to his salon for over 20 years. He keeps current with new styles and trends which makes the "JoJo experience"  vibrant and fun!<//Review>< GmapID>

Recently went to Jojo and came to conclusion that this place is a little bit overrated. I paid almost 300$ for them to bleach and tone my hair. I like how the hair turned out but didnt like that my dress was ruined and the bleach was all over my back. It took a week for the burn feeling to go away. Next time i will try another studio in the area.< /review>

I have been seeing Heath close to 5 years. I absolutely love walking out of the salon after he's worked his magic! The atmosphere is very nice and clean and the staff is wonderful and friendly!<//Review>

I have been going to JoJo's Hair Studio since 1979!!! I always feel like a princess when I am there and have been thrilled with the services that are provided.  I have been using Heath for the past several years.  I get many compliments on my hair cut and color.< /text>

<text>First visit since March!  I desperately needed a haircut, and I wanted a change from my normal style.  Nina was able to do exactly what I described.  JoJo has put in place all the necessary precautions and protocols to keep the clients and staff safe during this crazy COVID time.  Thanks to all! ❤️< /text></record>

Jojo Hair Studio is in all seriousness one of the best salon experiences I've had in 30 years.

I and my spouse came in to fix our hairmergency - our hair desperately needed care, cut, and color.

I'd researched many local salons but the top pick was Jojo Hair Studio. I called and spoke to Ray Ray, who was effervescent, friendly and accommodating, so I went right ahead and booked.

We've now completed the first half of this process (consultation, cut and style) and are looking forward to returning to complete our color plans as well.

The salon itself is an absolutely lovely space -we'd had a stressful day and felt immediately more relaxed and happy upon walking in and being greeted by the staff.

The decor, the layout, and the whole vibe just makes me feel the place is loved and cared for by the owner and staff. It has that special energy, more like an artists studio than 'just' a place of business (and the coffee and biscotti are excellent)

Ray Ray and Rosa gave us both inspired, attentive, and lovely service, and understood exactly what we both wanted to do with our hair. My spouse's long romantic princess hair and my dragon warrior do have never *ever* looked better

We're GNC trans folx who feel best when our outward presentation matches our identity - Ray Ray and Rosa gave us the cut and style of our lives, and made us both look and feel more like our real selves. I've never seen my spouse so happy with their hair, and so pretty!

I myself couldn't be happier with Ray Ray's work on my hair, and his plans for my color - he has a real genius for this work, and I feel so lucky to be able to collaborate with an artist who really *gets* what I'm trying to achieve

I'd recommend Jojo Hair Studio to other LGBTQIA+ people looking for boutique salon treatment in amazing surrounds with inspired artists who care about their work

I'll be returning with another review and before/after pictures when our color is completed :)< /text>

< Review>
Excellent cocktails and appetizers.  Pasta entrées very good,  but overly salted for our taste. They sat us 20 minutes after our reservation, and then they put us at a shared table.  It was fine,  just not what we were wanting.  Victor, our server, was great!! Definitely will go back though.< /Review>

Please add some vegan friendly options to menu so we don't have to do off menu items.  You always accommodate but it just makes it harder.<//Text>

Great spot in San Anselmo, with cool vibe and excellent  antipastos to start the experience off right. The calamari is a favorite along with rhe otherworldly brussel sprout chips, do not miss this item. Very well done wide taste drinks menu, and good beer selection for an Italian esque restaurant. The main dishes have wide appeal from vegan to meat lovers, great pizzas and very good coffees and deserts to finish your meal. Also there is plenty off outdoor space especially on the weekends (Friday through Sunday) when the town shuts down the streets and the restaurant flows out on to San Anselmo Ave.< /text>

<Review>Brought my family to Cucina SA for my mom’s birthday.   Started off a little slow - had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation.  Glad we waited.  The food was delicious and fresh.  The staff was extremely friendly and the other dinners seemed to also be enjoying their evenings.  Most importantly my mom loved her birthday dinner at Cucina SA with her family.</Review>< resp>

My family and I just had an excellent lunch here.  The service was speedy and very polite and the food was freshly made and very flavorful. I'd highly recommend Cucina for either a quick lunch or a leisurely dinner.< /Review>

Had a great meal here on Father's Day.  Great location for a larger family dinner (there were 10 of us), and the menu is varied enough to make the 10 years and the 50 year olds all happy.  Food was delicious and the service was great.  My husband happened to leave his Father's Day gift at the restaurant by mistake, and we were very delayed in getting back to the restaurant to get it.  When we finally made it back, about 3 weeks later, Donna the owner, was unable to find it.  Took my name and number and told me she would look thoroughly the next day.  By 10am the next morning, I got a call, and she was online ordering it for me and having it sent to my house because she could not find it!  Talk about going above and beyond the call of duty!  I will definitely be back not only for the fabulous food but the amazing client care.  Thank you again Donna!<//Text>

The wine is actually warm when it's poured, like it has been kept next to a heater or something.  This is inexcusable in such a nice restaurant.

< Review>
My son went to get a car wash and they over charged him even though he had a coupon. When I called, the woman who works as a cashier was rude and said it was not her problem. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR WASH. THERE ARE OTHERS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER IN THE AREA. DO NOT NEED TO PAY GOOD MONEY TO BE TREATED RUDELY.<//Review>

Wax marks all over the truck still. Had to go back and re wipe off at least one spot on every panel of the vehicle myself when I got home. Tons of wax left between the body panels. I didn’t even want to explain to the employee how bad of a job they did. Very frustrating. I guess I should just be happy they didn’t damage the vehicle.</Text><Time>1614529995747< /Time></record></dataset><record>

My husband came home extremely upset with the quality and level of service he received today. He was treated rudely and because he got “The special Wednesday “ wash they didn’t clean the inside of the car which was still sticky and dirty. He asked for them to clean and they said no because he needs to pay full price. I rarely review but seeing previous reviews it seems like they have not improved their level of service. We will not come here again and suggest to save your money and go elsewhere. The business owner should share the customer complaints to his staff and train them on customer service.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>These people DAMAGE your car paint. They sprinkle your car with some water and leave it in the sun to dry.  During strong sunlight the tiny water particles on your car become magnifying glasses that literally burns the paint. When I asked the manager why no one works on my car to dry it, the answer was: We are busy. What? $22 to sprinkle my car and damage the paint? Just go elsewhere. This place is overpriced, and the quality of their work cannot be worse.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The shampoo interior detailing was amazing because my ride looked like new afterwards and it got done while I waited. There is a taco truck and McDonald's and lots of seating inside and out. Nice cars getting serviced like Maserati, high end audi etc. Thanks to them my hoopty reincarnated into a source of pride like the first day I got it.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Well, I understand the low ratings after coming here for a headlight cleaning. I was wondering why cleaning both headlights costed only $40 ($20 per light). They superficially cleaned the outside but not the inside. They also included the "bonus" of a car wash and interior vacuuming. Both were very superficial. If a company cannot do the simple things exceptionally well, then I wouldn't bother giving the more bonus.

The lazy receptionist was a joke. She didn't great new customers walking in and wondered why any one asked her anything. We were interrupting her TV watching.</review><Time>1578886875089</Time><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I never write reviews, but this time I decided to do it because it was a real bad experience.
I went to this place twice, the first time the service was bad, I got the platinum wash, and all they did was a regular car wash and finished in less than 5 minutes, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and I went back again with a coupon I received of car wash and wax for $13.00 and first they charge me $18.00 dollars and all it said on the receipt they give you was “car wash” I thought they knew what they were doing but then again all they did was a regular car wash and not even a good one again!! What’s the point of giving coupons if you are not going to keep your word?!?!? Worst experience ever!<//text>

I just so happen to be in the area and decided to try them. I own a truck and normally my usual carwash charges $18 including armour all. They charged me $22 and no armour all. They did a nice job but their all around prices are higher than most. But it's the area and location that dictates $. I talk to the guy and he said he would throw in the armor all for free LOL but at $22 that still not free. The extra $3 that car washes charge is ok but the base starting $ is what kill it if you own a larger vehicle.</Text>

A lot of reviewers gave these great reviews but only left 3 or 4 stars, like they don’t know how this works. Great review=5 stars. The value of service exceeded the price I paid, so I wanted to make sure I gave the 5 stars they deserved. Thank you for the service you provided today, it was a great deal, my oil change was quick, the car looks amazing. Thank you!<//Review>

Very questionable business practices. Received this coupon in the mail and since I needed both a wash and an oil change, thought it was a great deal. First walked in and spoke to a lady who told me that they don’t offer that deal on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. I mentioned that the coupon does not say anything about restrictions on certain days and she looked at it again and told me that there was a different one that did, but that I was lucky because I had this one. She sent me to the oil change area to get a ticket.

When I spoke to the man at the oil change area he told me that this offer is not valid on synthetic oil. I asked him to show me where on the coupon it specified which oil type and he said “anyone would know” that it didn’t cover synthetic since it’s only $29.99. I asked again how we would know if it was not specified on the coupon, and again he just said that “anyone would know.” Clearly not “anyone” since I did not know. I suggested that they specify this on future coupons, to avoid this confusion in the future and he said there are so many types of cars, Mercedes, BMW, etc. that there is not way to specify each and every car. Don’t specify the car, specify “conventional oil only” or “deal does not apply to synthetic oils” like any other place would do (I’m sitting at Jiffy Lube right now where they have a very similar offer, which specifies “conventional oil”). Seems from the start that they never intended to honor the coupon they sent out.<//Text>

Robin and his crew are amazing! My Matrix has been across the country and on several road trips this year - all without a wash, thanks to the drought.

This place is good, sometimes the wait is a tad long, but they do get busy. I came in here for an oil change had a coupon on the back of my receipt from Ralph’s. It said $25.99 for an oil change; little to my knowledge it didn’t include synthetic oil. So they didn’t honor the coupon; but other than that; if you need an oil change and a light cleaning of the outside of your car, 4 stars.< /review>

<text>Be careful here... stopped by for an oil change and wash. Was hugely overcharged by the attendant. Was provided an initial cost and when service were completed, several additional charges had been added - without my knowledge or prior consent. In addition, it was stated that an oil filter would be included, was charged an extra $10 for this too.

Not comfortable with the experience here. Will not return.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I've been there and I just LOVED it.

I was kinda concerned because of the bad reviews here but decided to give it a try anyway.

I couldn't be happier. Service was great, attendant was very polite, and they really focus on the details.

I wish I could rate it 10 stars.

I'll definitely bring my car back.< /Review>< Date>

I paid 40 dollars for my car wash and I didn't mind hoping that the more I pay the better service I would get. My car was pretty dirty considering I have 2 kids but I was expecting way better service at first glance everything seemed good but as soon as I got home I realized they didn't vaccum under my car or between the cracks, my back seats were not even wiped down or "waxed" as they say and my back window had fingerprints I was so disappointed I could've just paid the regular price for that service or even done it myself. 40 dollars for a carwash that I'll still have to clean up after !?< /Review>

My car is neither a Lamborghini, nor a Tesla. It's not vintage Porsche or a collectable Ferrari.  But the guys at California Detailing treated my 2004 Honda Accord as if it were the rarest of vehicles.  I've had my car detailed here in the past and just recently brought it in again. And i will continue to return here when my car needs it.  Jim runs an impeccable business. Carlos and his team are the all-pros of detailing. Carlos is the best!  I am simply floored by their attention to detail. My car looks brand new. It's beautiful. Don't think twice about this place -it is definitely worth it.</review>

I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was already unpleased with the fact I had to point out basics such as my driver's side was barely vacuumed and the middle console had not been touched. However the person who assisted when I got up to there took no issue with having it corrected. But what has pissed me off is that I asked to have my trunk vacuumed out and even said I would pay more for it and the guy told me it would not be a problem only just open the trunk only for me to get home and see it was not done!< /review>

Came by to get an oil change. Wandered inside for a few minutes and no one was there. As I was about to leave someone followed me out and told me they aren’t open because it’s going to rain. Apparently they only do oil changes when people also get a car wash. Kind of sucks since I mostly just needed the oil change. Be wary of the weather when coming here.</text>

Awful car wash never would recommend to anyone. My car interior is still dirty and I still need to have it vacuumed and detailed, due to their poor ability in their profession. If your car isn’t a high class car don’t come here. My car didn’t even smell like the air freshener I purchased with my expensive car wash at 40$ when I originally asked for the 20$. I was expecting a superior job. Gave them two chances. Never again<//Text>

< Review>
This place provides a great car wash, but the three stars is for the price increases within the past year. A regular car wash with armoral on the tires was $17.99 a year ago, then it went to $19.99, and now it’s $21.99. I typically would go here once a week, but now I’ll be going every other week. Too bad. I like these guys, but with a tip I’ll be paying over $100 a month to wash my car. You guys should think about lowering your prices.<//Review>

I always go to VALVOLINE for a lube service
but when I tried this place I will never go back to VALVOLINE or any lube locations. First of all I got a big BANG ON MY BUCK! who can beat a FREE CARWASH with a lube service. Crews were great, from the man who did the oil change to the man who waxed and clean my car. This will be my new place for my lube service and will highly recommend it to friends and family.</text>

This has been the family car wash for me, my mom and my uncle since the mid 90's. I have gone all over the city over the years to explore competitors, but they always leave my car the cleanest. They are truly professional and as long as they are open for business, they will always have my family's business.</review>

<Text>The price has gotten more expensive, as the service has gotten a little worse. I've been coming to this caress for years. They're always trying to sell you a package wash you don't need, but will pay more for. They are always busy, but they try to get you in and out as soon as they can, because they need the space for another car. Manners aren't the management's strong suit. They are never polite, but I go, because of necessity and convenience.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I will NEVER go back to this car wash EVER again!

I TAKE MY CARS TO THIS PLACE  FOR PAST 10 YEARS  NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD, BECAUSE I'M SUPER BUSY AND I DON'T HAVE A TIME TO FIND A GOOD ONE !

Here is my story:
I took one of my cars to this place 3 weeks ago and I ended up with BROKEN BREAK SENSOR, I talked to the owner ( Maurice ) after I saw CHECK BRAKE SENSOR sign in my car when I turned on the engine after carwash was done, he said I should take my car to the dealer ship asap, So I took my car to the dealership next day and they said carwash broked my car BRAKE SENSOR so they should change it to new one which is cost $1500 and they did.

I went to la cienega carwash few days after I fixed my car to talk to the owner (The most rude, low level, uneducated person I've ever seen in my life) and explain the situation, he said that's true, Carwash rail can damage BRAKE SENSOR in lower cars but they are not responsible for it, there is nothing he can do for me but he won't put my car over the rail next time and he make sure to wash the car outside the rail.
Today, I took my car for wash to this place again and I remind them to wash my car outside, they said it cost $30 and it takes 45 min, I found the owner and I asked him if he can give me a better deal after what happend to my car last time , he said NO MAM, I CAN'T DO THAT, I KNOW YOU ARE A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR MANY YEARS BUT I LOOSE MY MONEY THIS WAY,.

REALLY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE  BECAUSE YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IS NOT SAFE FOR  LOWER CARS TO GO OVER CARWASH RAIL, SECOND OF ALL, ONE CARWASH COST ME $1500 PLUS SO MUCH TROBBLE & HEADECH AND I DIDN'T EVEN SUE YOU, NOW YOU LOOSE YOUR MONEY OVER $30?

SHAME ON YOU!

STAY A WAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE PLACE!</review>

<text>I paid $225 for a Honda Pilot buffer &  detail as I wanted my car really clean. I emptied all compartments beforehand. They didn't even open to clean the glove compartment which was full of dust;  the middle compartment between the front seats was filthy as it was originally. No wax and no buffering that I could tell. Carpets were still full of stains; below than average cleaning everywhere else. I took it back twice just for the inside when I saw how dirty it was and they spent a few more minutes cleaning. I paid $225 and maybe got a $15 - $35 job!!!! I paid the big bucks & got lousy incompetent service. I don't want to go there again! 😁 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬< /text>< rating>

< Review>
Looks like they used a dirty rug to dust the inside and when asking to address this I was told for $13.99 they didn't have to wipe my dash board, nor cup holders and that my car was probably really dirty to start with!!!!! Super insulting from one of their employees! And when asked to talk to manager, he surprisingly just left for lunch! I've had $9 car wash that looked a lot better at same place! Wasn't asking for detailing but just use a clean rug so there's no fibers etc into my cup holders or dashboard. My console wasn't wipe at all! was happy to come here for over 3 years but no more, enough attitude and laziness, that's for sure! Too bad!</Review>

I end up here more often because of their proximity to my home. Overall quality of the wash is about average -- they get the job done.

Detailing here is sub-par. No attention to detail and they are HORRIBLE at estimating the time it's going to take them to do the work.

I would say if you just need a wash and some armor-all on the tires and this is convenient, then go for it. But go elsewhere for your detailing.<//review>

Great Uber and Lyft discounted services.  Fair priced wash and dry in covered location.  Drying and detail of cleaning obviously depends on employee that ends up with your car, but time is taken to ensure most parts of your vehicle receive a towel touch.< /Text>

<Review>Im a Uber/Lyft driver. I pass this car wash all the time. They advertise specials for drivers . I’ve been wanting to try it out. Today felt like the perfect day no one was waiting in the spots . I drove right up . There was only one person getting vacuumed . I waited for a few  minutes for someone to come ask me what kind of wash I wanted .  During this time other pl rolled up beside me and behind me. While still waiting patiently for someone to come ask me for what kind of wash. The workers went to the other cars and took them. So I asked who spoke English I explained no one helped me and you guys took these other pl how do I leave. He didn’t even say sorry or anything to me but just to make a uturn and then I can go out . I would never be back here again.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Paid 21 freaking dollars for a car wash which they did a very horrible job at. Whatever they usd on the windows mess up my tint then i get told they can fix it for an additional 10 dollars per window after i just paid for a car wash. I have never paid that much for a car wash before & i have never been less satisfied. I didnt get what i paid for i feel ripped off!</review>

The upsell is obnoxious, but the car wash is good.  I sent my neighbor there and  she said they wouldn't do a basic wash so she came back home and washed her car in the driveway.  Are these guys really that kind of cheese ball that they tell some people the basic wash isn't available?</Review>

It was like 2 stars before when it was a touchless carwash. Now part of the process has the mechanical brushes. I watched in horror last visit as my rear wiper was nearly ripped off by this contraption. This plac is a half mile from my house so it ia convenient.

<Text>I went to the car wash today. It was a circus. The new conversion to a Lyft carwash im sure is great for lyft drivers but not for a regular customer such as myself. Service was extremely  slow and crowded . I witnessed two different workers arguing with customers that were asking simple questions on pricing for hand wax and another customer agitated that she was in line for 30 minutes waiting for her minivan to be vacuumed.The customers were responded to in an agitated manner by each worker they spoke with. Lyft drivers were not in the lyft lane which caused more issues,delays, and confusion. I've been going to this carwash for years. It's convenient because I live in the area. However with the new change and poor service I seen displayed today I will not go back. If a business is going to implement change they should ensure they can handle increased volume of customers and train their employees on customer service. Definitely rated a 1!<//Text><Rate>1</Rate>< resp>

<rating>4</rating><review>Been there twice and I have to agree with new reviews that their upsell is very annoying.  But, if you ca get through those sale pitches, what you get is one of the best hand wash for dirt cheap price.  I believe the lady at cashier is the owner and she has okay attitude.  The waiting room has ac and a large tv with news on.  Not too shabby.

They raised their price and I get the $14.99 wash with wax (combo #1).  I was the 2nd car there when they opened.  The whole wash took 25 min but their cleaning crew was very polite and he worked very thoroughly on my car.<//review>< Pics>

No, nada, never, no way, yuck, I won't be back. Should call this a car dirt rub. They spread the dirt around leaving crud all over the aluminum wheels, sills, ashtray, etc. Had to revacuumn too. When I asked the guy to clean more, he had the hoo haws to argue and asked me how many months it had been since my last wash. It was not over the top filthy either. Dirt is the reason you go to a car wash, right? Really!? When he asked me how long it had been, I just shook my head and thought, "NOYFB (none of your ....... ........)." Well guess what? Good way to lose business, do a crappy job and also insult the customer. I own two businesses. If I ever had employees behave that way, out the door they'd go. I want my $ back.<//text>

I would like to put a good and bad review, first of all, you have a great cleaning crew working there, and second, unfortunately your cashier has a BAD, DISAPOINTING COSTUMER SERVICE OVER DE PHONE, her name is ALINA or something like that, she couldn't even tell me her name right and HANGUP the phone on me, keeping people like that working at this location gives bad experience to your costumers, to me and not wanting to come back to wash my car there, I wouldn't like to someone else experience what I went to, please do something about it. my rate os for phone custumer service and not for cleaning crew.<//Text>

Their " CUSTOMER SERVICE " is Zero .
After they washed my wife's car, she noticed that the inside of the car was not cleaned properly & it was not the first time  (it had happened 3 more times) .
When she talked to the manager he denied & said I'm not manager & while talking to the cashier, he was laughing at my wife & said come tomorrow. My wife said as you see I'm here with my 3 kids & can't come again.
Finally my wife forced them to clean it ,but this is not the right way of CUSTOMER SERVICE.
My wife asked 2 more employees to make sure about the manager & they confirmed that he was the manager whose name is Shawn.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Very bad experience with my visit, they broke the clip of my rug, I came back to see if they had it and of course not, but it was worse knowing that at least I am not the first person to hurt their car in some way . It has saved several types of clips. Which means that they were, they grab it and they will keep on grabbing it. They do not take care when vacuuming the car and removing the rugs. The worst thing is that not even I feel sorry for damaging your car, much less they were going to offer me plague for the damage. What a pity

Muy mala experiencia con mi visita., quebraron el clip de mi tapete., regrese para ver si lo tenían y por supuesto que no., pero fue más peor enterarme que al menos no soy la primera persona que le dańan de algún manera su carro. Tiene guardados varías tipos de clips . Lo que significa que lo isieron,lo asen y seguirán asiendo., no tienen cuidado al aspirar Los carro y remover los tapetes.    Lo peor es que ni siquiera un lo siento por dańar tu carro, ni mucho menos me iban a ofrecer plagar por el dańo.

You get a complimentary beverage of choice. The team working there is really nice. Have a hairstyle picked out to show what you want done prior.

Of course I received a less than perfect blowout and I expressed that to the person at the front desk and just like my blowout I got a less than perfect response about my comment.  She didn't apologize, or even offer to have me come back to make it right.  I left a tip anyway because that's the right thing to do< /Review>< Pics>

The area in nice and very remover from the urban feel so much of San Diego can have. My Fiance is very picky as she has every right to be. Amber the stylist was spot on with all of her expertise. I was going to wait to do my review for a couple of days but my fiance said give their business 5 stars! Thank you ladies!<//text>

I love this place! The environment is so fun and all the girls who work here and so friendly. I was never satisfied with the fullness and length of my hair, and then I had a consultation with a stylist about hair extensions. They were all so knowledgeable and now I can't live without my extension hair!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone!<//Review>

I love Blowbunny! I use them for everything from just a simple blowout to eyelash extensions and hair extensions. They use the highest quality hair extensions & hair products! This is my go to place for when I'm feeling low or even when I have fun places to go to like a wedding, family pictures or even date night. I recommend them over and over again!< /Review>

Staff I came in contact with were very friendly, professional and Hannah was very sweet and accommodating.  She listened to me and was willing to do what I asked when she was styling my hair.  She also did my make up and I looked beautiful!  My husband was very happy with the results.  I will recommend Blowbunny to all my friends.

I was fortunate enough to get an appointment to have my hair done with the most up to date stylist.   She made my hair look really great, and felt like silk.  That's hard to do with short hair.   Good job girls at Blow Bunny, you have a new BFF< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

They said it's just the two of them and they are cleaning up to close.even thought the hrs said open till 7:00 they wanted to close at 6:00 I guess. Luckily I found a salon nearby got there at 6:00 and was done by 6:45.< /text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I have spent thousands of dollars with this company but I will never ever do business with them again. Last month I bought all new hair and had it put in. The tabs proceeded to turn GREEN. All of them. They are defective. The owner was made aware of the problem and has done NOTHING to rectify the situation except suggest someone else is to blame. It would cost this woman a fraction of what I've spent with her to replace this hair and keep a repeat customer happy. Instead, she chose to make herself unavailable when I came in to deal with the situation face-to-face (I had an appointment) and had her manager speak on her behalf. When I insisted the front desk manager text the owner because I needed to speak with her immediately, the owner responded saying I could leave. I am appalled! What a horrific experience!</text>

Going to Blowbunny is so fun and you always come out looking more beautiful. I received a KERATIN  treatment and it made my crazy FRIZZY hair soft and smooth and feel like real GORGEOUS hair. It made my hair healthier instead of destroying it the way the Brazilian treatment did. I can't wait to do it again.....highly recommend Blowbunny above and beyond.< /text>

As soon as you walk in the ambiance and decor is super chic and the staff are pretty ladies with great attitudes and friendly smiles. (Genuine hospitality and no fabricated gestures.) The stylists are very accommodating and very talented. I love that Blowbunny offers several services like hair and lash extensions, make up, and top of the line hair products such as award winning product line, Oribe. I love that this salon carries the best of the best! I can't wait to go back and just pamper myself while I sip on their coffee and come out looking like a wannabe movie star!!!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Blowbunny is my go to for Blowouts and Extensions! I have really fine, thin hair and always wished I had long, thick hair. I have an ombre so I thought it would be impossible to match my hair with extensions as it hasn't turned out very well at other places. Blowbunny was able to match me perfectly! I've NEVER gotten so many compliments on my hair after getting them. They changed my life!<//Text>

<text>Best car wash near me!!
Strong vacuum...
Strong air compressor...
Washes good..
Not as much water left on car after wash like others, but they give you a free car towel (not sure if they give it with the cheapest wash tho)
Nice owner!!<//text><user_id>106014657960637695588</user_id>< username>

<review>It was quick. I liked how it washed my car. But drying was terrible. Which at the end is the whole point. I got the cheapest one but still left the car wash with more spots than before. Loved the new vacuums tho.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP5Lpd1GuHyPx6tMphnl3vMd5fvHlCrubrFY3J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlzV7LtmkiL33BLQvFDoUjz-wlYvpYP9skvv1D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd293ee6083269:0x7cb4b1698e6c0e03< /gmapID></record>

I got the $6 basic wash. Not bad, my only complaints are that the soap wasn't 100% washed off and the dryers didn't dry completely, left some water spots and the sap and small dirt scratches didn't quite get washed off my car. In my experience these express car washes never 100% wash and dry my car anyways though.

Free vacuums is included even with basic package. They have okay suction but it's a little difficult because they don't have any precision vacuum hoses for the tight cracks. The pressure air hose was necessary to finish drying off my side view mirrors, although they have a package with spot free rinse but I don't know if it works well.

You pay through a kiosk with card (or cash as well I believe) and workers get up to assist you for aligning your car with the belt, and sprayed some water or something around my car to prep it.

Overall, it's pretty much what I expected in an express car wash and I got what I paid for.<//review>

Very nice car wash.
Reasonable price.
Got a free rag with my purchase.

They got the pressured air pump so you can dry the little spots that didn't dry up after the wash.
Vacuum is really strong.

I tried the shine & polish for $15 more. My SUV looked really nice after, I got a lot of compliments.

Definitely will be back!!</Review>

Kind of confusing when entering. Not clear where to go..  My Car came out dirty and still soapy even though i got the more expensive $14 wash.  Can't imagine what it would look like for the basic wash.  Air pressure and vacuums are  weak and not much lighting since i washed at sunset..</Text>

<Review>Got my car very clean, much better than other similar car washes in area. It actually may have been too aggressive- it bent my front license plate, shattered the plastic plate frame, and ripped one of the screws out of the bumper. Not a huge deal, but I did have to replace the screws with oversize ones and remove the broken plate frame.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The sales associates were really nice and helpful.  The store had a great sale going on! I went in for 1 thing and walked out with 7 for about the same price as 2 regular priced items. 💜< /Text>

Normal midsized Bath and Body Works. Very friendly staff, but their limited capacity may mean you have to wait outside during busy times. They provide you with scented hand sanitizer before entering though, so that's a bonus</Review>

<text>The staff at this Bath & Body Works are very helpful and friendly. They have a great selection of fall items right now. Their clearance section is pretty picked over but I got some great deals. I like this location because it has an outdoor entrance and they have hand sanitizer at the front door.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>Employee greeted use within feet of walking through the front door on a mid Friday day.  There were other customers shopping and getting the help they needed. We to were asked if they could help. The very polite employee knew what we wanted and also got the attention of another very polite employee lady that was actually trying to go home from a good day at work. She  was in good spirits and took a few minutes to tell us about the product and point out a few other items.  I will mention that a friendly "special" service person was in the store picking up barrels trying not to disrupt the store. A+  B&BW<//review>< resp>

<Text>OMG I love this place. All their products smell amazing. All the candles are wonderful, but a little overpriced. IDK I feel like 17.50$$ is a little much for a candle. i love all their body products.the creams are super smelly in the best way possible and keep you super hydrated. About twice a year they have the best sale ever. Around now it's like 50-75 percent of on select items. All their winter cents are amazing. I love the hot chocolate because it so unique but it makes me hungry. Their body sprays I haven't tried but have heard the best things About. They have so many scents and all are lovely. Gift boxes are so cute. Good place for gifts and the little bottles are adorable and same product as the big ones<//Text><user>110964380504416064948< /user>< resp>

<username>Aaron Botel<//username><Time>1608425688386< /Time><rating>1< /rating><Text>Delivery Driver: Came here for an easy order. Showed up at the empty counter, with two staff members in the back not really doing anything. Attempted to show them my phone for confirmation on the order. Instead, they just asked me if I was here for a mobile order w/o name. When they bring the order out, I tested them by stating who is this for. Neither one of them knew until they went into the back again. I wasn't surprised and gave an obvious sign of how no care. After I gave such rolled eye action and made an 180. They started to talk loudly behind my back, saying if I had a problem while not understanding why I made my reaction for the lack of making sure everything was good.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

It's a very small and cute ice cream spot with very..instagrammable... dessert. The charcoal ice cream with crispy rice is very well made and not too strong of a flavor. Their charcoal waffle cone is probably one of the best ones I have eaten and would highly recommend it over a cup.< /text>

First time customer and visit. Place was really nice, clean and organized. Staff was nice and knowledgeable. Product is great, the items that I had paid for were worth the money and priced accordingly; unfortunately not other places are able to pull this part right. Wait time wasn't bad for walk in, went 10:30 am and waited about 15 minutes to get inside and see the budtender. I  love that they have specials online and in store everyday. I am a define repeat customer 👍< /Review>

They earned and deserved each one of the stars. Book the appointment online less than 24 hours later checked in... 20 minutes later certificate in hand and off to get more coffee. Really easy and efficient with some smiling faces even behind the masks. Highly recommend! Thank You! 😊🤙< /Review>

I just moved to the area and needed an emergency repair as well as a new auto shop. I've been a loyal customer to my last shop for 20 years. I followed the good reviews and I wasn't disappointed at all. I showed up at opening and they took me in right away. The whole team that took my assignment were attentive and transparent. Micheal even brought out the damaged part (spark plugs wires) for me to see and explain why my car wasn't working. I have an 02' Kia Rio so she's doing the best she can on small repairs that I can afford. Sal was great about breaking down prices for me in a priority type list. I'll be back to have more repairs done for sure. The labor prices may seem a bit high but it's good to know that they care enough about their employees to pay them well. I'll be hitting them up for my next oil change in a couple weeks. I think I found my new auto shop!<//Text>

<text>I decided to go based off the many great reviews on here and i was not disappointed. Manuel, my service advisor was very professional, and very very informative. I took my hybrid tahoe for a diagnostic for the hybrid battery and an oil leak. They sent me a link that had their findings and included pictures of what the issues were. It made me feel reassured. When i went to go pick up, Manuel was very straight forward about what exactly i needed and he didn't try to up-sell me. I also met the owners and they were phenomenal people! Great shop, great services and great experience!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Hailee is amazing! Had both my axels done and my car is running much better. I have been here twice and the customer service is too notch. However, I would like a more detailed explanation on what was performed after paying. I always feel rushed when I’m asking critical questions. Also the invoice gives recommendations that don’t seem correct. It told me to change my windshield wiper blades when I actually did so the week prior. I also wanted to have my fluids checked and I didn’t see that on my paperwork. I’m just a gal who knows nada about cars so I feel I like to know more about what was serviced. Thank you Redhawk I will be back!<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1602682985046, 'text': 'Christine, thank you for your kind words about Hailee and the customer service you received!

They've done several repairs for my BMW 330i including my 100k service & smog. They do all my oil changes. They're always professional. This last time, they let me use a loaner so I didn't have to rent a car!! I'm super happy, plus being a AAA member, you get a discount. Great place to go, very trustworthy.</review>

Manuel was very professional and also communicated everything going on with my car.  He took his time for me to understand the problems and was able to point out various issues and the pricing was not bad at all.  I felt like he wasn’t trying to push for a sale, he was just going over the facts and worked with me to figure out a plan.  I just moved to Temecula and I think I found my new go-to mechanic.  Great service!  Thank you!< /Text>

2010 MDX with Battery Low indicator coming on.  A month prior to this visit, RedhawkAuto had previously done some work as the same light had been coming on and after extensive electrical testing they found a draw and fixed it.  This time, with the same indication light, they found no problem, just a glitch that many MDXs have, but absolutely nothing wrong with the car.  They did a lot of checking, a lot of work, and didn’t charge me a dime.  Translation- these folks do excellent, HONEST work.  I’ll return with my other card.< /text>

Manny's very knowledgeable and always a pleasure to work with.  Usually with great service you can expect to pay a little extra, however I am not sure how these guys are so affordable!

Manny took good care of me.  Only complaint is that it took a week to get done and I had to call to inquire about the status - they didn't call me with updates or anything.  But that's a minor complaint.  They did good work and I'm very satisfied.  I will return if/when I need more work done for sure.</Review>

They took advantage of me it was the first time I needed to get my oil changed and I walked in and had no idea what I was doing. They charged me 80 dollars for an oil change.< /text>

We are new to the Temecula area and we like to use a shop that is reliable. Lucky for us we found this place. Manny the manager is the one that made us want to come back to this place. His knowledge and professionalism is outstanding. We used to take our Mercedes to the dealer but no more. Thank you manny and the whole team you guys are great. We really appreciate it and will keep referring your service to others. Keep up the great work.<//Text>

< review>
I brought my car in because it was overheating. Turns out my water pump starting going out 2 weeks moving here from Washington. They were very helpful and honest about what was wrong with my car especially when it came down to testing my head gasket that ended up being blown. Disappointing, yes. But they were up front about what I should do with my car instead of proceeding just to make profit. When I get my new car, I will most definitely be bringing it into them for regular and major maintenance. Good auto shops are so hard to find these days.<//review>

Since I am fairly new to this area and only have the one car, I chose Redhawk because they are a AAA recommended garage and they have a loaner car segment to their service. Even though I was a first-time customer, I was treated like I had been using them for years. They fixed my 4-Runner, kept in touch with me, and made sure I would come back again!<//Review>

<Review>This place is GREAT guys!! My Elderly parents car just stopped being able to be started overnight (literally). So my trusting parents (against my suggestion) called and had there car towed into Temecula Toyota. With in a couple of hours Toyota called back and said that the main electrical system had to be replaced for a RIDICULOUSLY HIGH PRICE of
$ 6500 dollars!!!! So I had it picked up and dropped off at REDHAWK AUTO SERVICE and with Ina couple of hours they informed us that the total cost to fix it would be $595.dollars to repair it!!!! great prices,GREAT place that you can trust to get an honest and fair price to fix your car 😉😁VERY GOOD SHOP!!!< /Review>< pics>

After reading the positive reviews we decided to have them fix our Ford Expedition. They were not only quick but their prices were very reasonable. Dropped it off at 10am and picked it up at 5pm. The staff was very friendly and honest. They have earned our future business. Thank you for your outstanding service.< /text>

I went in there one day before I was supposed to go on a cross country trip, Shane and the guys at Redhawk Auto Service had me in first thing the next morning and on the road by 11:30am. I got to leave the same day I was supposed to. Service was excellent and the staff bends over backwards to get you the parts and service completed on time. I recommend these guys to everyone.<//Text>

Shane provided excellent customer service, above and beyond what I expected.  I've been using another auto service for years,  but will switch to Redhawk Auto Service, now that I know there is someone who is helpful, friendly and efficient like Shane.

Thank you for a great experience,

Mr. Swindler was quite nice and accommodating. I brought my car in for a smog check on a Monday morning and he had me in and out in 25 min despite being absolutely slammed and down 2 people due to illness. He was multitasking answering the phone, working the computer, and checking me in. He never lost his composure and had a very pleasant demeanor the whole time. He also gave me coupon price without me even having a coupon! I will be going back to Redhawk for all my future automotive needs and will continue to tell all my friends and family how well they treated me ..  Kudos!  :)< /review>

<Text>Manny has been taking care of my car since I got it and the one before that since 2011 when I moved here.  He was recommended to me by my daughter and son in law who have used his skills since they moved up h ere in 2009., My husband took care of all our cars needs and since he is no  longer around I feel so lucky to have Manny as my car guy and friend, I would never let anyone else touch my vehcle.

Great to work with. They said it would be $125 to diagnose the problem and it ended up only being our battery. Instead of charging us for a new battery and installation, they let us know it was still under warranty through our dealer and even ended up charging us only half the diagnosis fee because they said it took less time to diagnose that issue than something more major. My husband and I so appreciated their honesty and integrity. We'll definitely use them in the future< /text>

<Text>I came in for brakes. I appreciate the free inspection, however, I was horrified by the price I was quoted. They said all 4 brakes had to be replaced. The amount was over  $1100.00!
I took it to another shop and they charged me $631.50 for the same services.
I think that is too big of a discrepancy, I do not think I will come back.</Text><rate>2< /rate><Time>1571086279833< /Time>< gmapID>

I went back for second service in July. . Won't ever go back. First service around 85.00
With Costco 15%. Which was fair.  Second was 116.00. Charged extra 50.00 for something. Came in with 11554 miles.window sticker shows next service at 54875 miles. Long time to go. But shows next service on 10/08/19. 3 months later. INVOICE readsperform next service at12803 miles. 1500 miles from current miles.and do on 9/2/19, 2 months after this service.  Moved to Midas on Inez. Good, honest, people. SO DISAPPOINTING.  .I'm sure COSTCO will not be pleased. They recommended it.< /review><Name>Gary Illingworth< /Name>< date>

I just would like to take the time to tell Shane thank you for taking the time to look at my car. My car broke down at 430pm on a Saturday. And  redhawk was closing in 30mins. Shane told me he would wait for me and not to worry. Now that's what I call great customer service. I made it home safe with my family thank you Shane.<//review>

I am so impressed with Redhawk Auto Service.  I brought in my old van that had some issues.  The repair didn't work at first and instead of saying it was my van and giving up they kept working at it and got it right.  This took a lot more work and expense on their end for which they gladly did wanting to make sure I was well taken care of.  They are so great to work with.  They listened and communicated with me so well.  They gave me another car to use while mine was getting fixed.  They do all they can to help you with your car issues.  The owner Tom and everyone at the shop went above and beyond what other places would have done.  All I can say is thank you and go to Redhawk Auto because you will be well taken care of.  Their desire is to serve and care for people not just run a business.  They take their name seriously  - Redhawk Auto SERVICE.<//text>

They have the BEST customer service. Everyone that works there is AWESOME. I work nights, so I drop my car off in the morning. They offer me a ride home so I can sleep while my car is being serviced.  Then pick me up after my nap. They are the best. I recommend them to my friends. Thanks Manny for excellent customer service every time I am there.<//review>

<review>Great service! I went in to do an oil change, but when I was in the waiting room, waiting for my car, I would hear other customers come in and talk about their car problem and the guys at Redhawk would give them option of what can be done - either spend a whole bunch of money to fix the car that could work a couple of months or buy another car that can last year's - sure they can fix it and charge the customer but they knew the reality and the condition of the car. I likes because they were honest and not greedy. I will definitely come back and use their service because they were honest to everyone that came in.

...and they are good mechanics!<//review>< user>

To have so many corporate auto repair shops in the area, it’s nice to have a shop family owned and operated. The level of honesty the mechanics have differs from those at the corporate owned business. And what I was quoted from one shop being 1000 dollars and needing to guy and entire system for sake of the business trying to squeeze me for all my worth, redhawk had my car fixed for under 200 dollars. Redhawk has a new loyal customer.< /Text>< Pics>

With 6 full bays, we explained our situation and they took care of us immediately. Within three hours we were back on the road. We are so thankful for them. We highly recommend using them.

We have been using Redhawk Auto for our propane needs, but the other day my son had an issue with his car. It wouldn’t start. The car was at Walmart across the street so we had AAA (DJ’s towing) tow it to their shop. The vehicle was barely off the tow truck and both the service writer and mechanic were looking at it to figure out the issue. To our surprise it started right up. They continued to run some tests and said everything looked good. We are so thankful and appreciative for their prompt service! I asked how much and they said no problem we didn’t fix anything! Wow! Such great customer service! They earned our auto repair service moving forward! Thank you Redhawk Auto!</Text>

Always very polite and they do good work at a fair price.  July 28 2018 I used red Hawk auto service again and they have once again won my loyalty. They worked on my AC heating and cooling issue and some engine light discrepancies on my 2008 Prius  . They were able to fix all issues at a reasonable time and at a reasonable price.
January 5, 2021 got a smog check and as always they are very polite and professional. They have a Smog Star rating so I never have to go anywhere else.<//Review>

Looking to have an oil change, and ended up finding a new place for my cars and repairs.
Alex explained everything to me, the ower also and a feeling I was finally at a shop I could trust.
Received a text telling me condition the of my car and what was needed.
Best part: Not Pressured into having it done now, or there!
I will be back!
Thanks for your service.< /Review>

We've tried to call and text but haven't heard back from you.  We know if we spoke with you we could clear up any questions that you may have. The labor charge included the diagnostic fee to determine the headlight assembly was leaking rainwater onto the Ballast, shorting it out.  It also included removing the entire front bumper to replace the Headlight Assembly as required by the manufacturer. As far as the parts are concerned, there are 4 parts to the Headlight Assembly: the Headlight Housing, Ballast, Igniter and Bulb.  The O'Reilly Headlights are 8 days out, special order and would not include the Ballast, Bulb or Igniter.  They stock the Igniter for $65 but they do not carry the $500 Ballast.  So when we compare our Headlight Assembly that comes with all 4 parts and a 3 year 36 thousand mile nationwide warranty, we would find that the repair that was completed on your Z to be correct and most cost effective.

Something came loose and I lost all the Freon
in my air conditioner. I pulled in to Redhawk Auto.Service and Sean looked under the hood and assessed what had happened. It was in the 90's and he knew i needed help right now. He wrote up a work order immediately and within 2 hours i was on the road again and cool as a cucumber! This is my second experience with these guys. Both positive . Honest and reasonable. Great customer service!!< /Review>

We know it was a rabbit because when my dash lights started flashing like a Christmas tree I pulled over and popped open the hood and to my screeching surprise the not so cute bunny lept over my left shoulder  and off to freedom. After trying their best to keep a straight face Manny and Sean went to work repairing the wiring and even discovered a chewed on hose that they replaced and was sure to become a future problem. I had my four year old Autistic grandson with me and Sean helped with a meltdown with a small lollipop and a free hat that has now become his favorite.

Took my car in yesterday for an oil change and tire rotation which was done satisfactorily as far as I know.  But I also had it in because my window washer fluid system has a leak in it somewhere.  I was told they couldn't find any leak and that maybe I had just used more fluid than I thought (not) and they had filled the reservoir.  Well, I had filled the reservoir previously and by the next day it was empty, and that was without driving anywhere or using the washer at all.  By the time I got home (23 miles) and then later checked the reservoir, it was empty.  No wet spot under the car so it must have leaked out on the way home.  If they didn't have time to do a thorough check or they didn't want to job they should have just told me and not shined me on.  Just because I'm a woman?????  EDIT - I filled the reservoir with water and found the leak myself when I turned on the washer for the front and then the back windows.  Water GUSHED out under the car at the rear.  They could easily have tested those lines just like I finally did.  And I had never said I thought the leak was in the reservoir, I said in the system. Totally incompetent as far as I'm concerned.  UPDATE:  I had called the day after the service to talk to Alex, the service writer that I had dealt with.  He was off that day, but I talked with Manny about the problem with the washer fluid leak still leaking.  Manny is really excellent at customer service, not only dealing with me, but the two instances I had observed while I was originally waiting for my car.  I really had no intention of going back there, but Manny was so sincere about wanting to make things right that I said "OK" and made an appointment for Monday. Alex called me on Friday, I think it was, and was saying how the tech had come to him and he checked also and blah, blah, blah.  I'm no mechanic, but I really don't see how they could NOT have checked the whole system when they couldn't find a leak in the container.  They never even came and asked if I had noticed any wet spots under the car.  Wouldn't have mattered since this was first noticed during those rains.  But don't forget, Alex ASSUMED that I had used more fluid than I realized due to all the butterflys AFTER the rains and wasn't bright enough to realize it.  Never an apology, never saying he wanted to make it right like Manny did, only excuses.  I was talking with my neighbor about the problem a day or so later and he took a look.  The rear hose for my back window washer fluid had come detached and that was where the leak was.  He put it back together and what do you know - no more leak.  Even if the hose wasn't completely apart when in the shop, it HAD to have been loose in order for the container to leak out in a day or day and a half.  Needless to say I will NEVER, EVER go back there again.  And I hope that Alex is given a class in customer service.  ANOTHER EDIT:  Today the owner, Mr. Grady, and I had a conversation and he sincerely apologized for the experience I had.  He even offered a free oil change, which I declined because I'm not out to get any freebies.  I really appreciate his calling me and discussing the situation and for his apology.  Just wanted to let everyone know that he was truly concerned.  However, I still won't go back there.  5/31/19  ADDITIONAL INFO:  When getting the receipt for the oil change, there were several recommendations, one of which was to remove and replace the transmission oil cooler pipes - 3 lines with fittings with 3 quarts of ATF for an estimated $672.  Today I had that work done at another AAA recommended shop which I've used many times before (it's just further away) and it cost $155.00 after my AAA 10 discount.  BIG DIFFERENCE.  I recommend shopping around before using Redhawk Auto.<//text>

Miguel was the gentleman that helped during my visit. The location is extremely easy to find as its connected to a 7-11 so that's a plus. Everyone there was friendly. Miguel was great. He got everything handled quickly and precisely. He broke down the services that were being done as well as the price for said services. It wasnt nearly what I thought it was going to be and it's a AAA approved location so I received a discount for being a member. This is the go to place for all my automotive maintenance and repairs from now on!<//review>

This place is awesome! I never heard of an auto repair shop giving a loaner car while your vehicle is being fixed. That sure helped me out getting my kids to and from school. I really appreciate everything Service Manager Rodney did for me. If customer service is just as important to you...go to RedHawk Auto Service.< /text>

<Review>Wife brought car in while I was on deployment. Car had no oil and check engine light on. Tech told her to change oil and replace battery(battery was working fine) and road test it to see which codes come back. A month later, All original symptoms are back and this place wants another $120 to diagnose the car again. They didn't diagnose anything, just took her $120 cleared some codes, replaced a good battery and sent her back on the road telling her to road test and see which codes come back on. Now they won't stick to their word and finish diagnosing!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
UPDATE: After I got in contact with the Owner and expressed the situation, he decided to give me a deal of half off for the third smog check. So my husband & I went back. When we got there Michael the Manager was still there. Michael took the car in for a smog check for the third time, and expressed that the car had failed once again. So he generously offered to fix the Timing to give the car a chance to pass the smog. After he fixed the timing they smog the car again, and the car passed. Although we had some misunderstanding at first, I am glad the owner charged us only half & Michael was generous enough to help us fix the timing so our car would pass the smog. I'm glad they showed us their dedication to their mission statement in the end, to make it right.

If I could give them 0 stars I would! My husband took his car to get smog checked two days ago. The Manager Michael told my husband that as long as the car did not pass he could keep bringing it back to get it smog for free. So when they told my husband his car did not pass the first time, my husband made some repairs then took it back for a second smog. The Manager Michael was not there but one of his employers was and he told my husband that he would only give him one free smog. My husband told him Michael had said he could bring it back as long as it did not pass until it did. So the employers said ok. They re-smog the car and the car did not pass so my husband ended up taking it to a shop. Today we took in the car for the third time to get it smog and the Manager Michael retrieved from his promise saying that no one works for free and that my husband had to pay another  $50 bucks for a smog check. After that he proceeded to be extremely rude saying that no one works for free around here that why would he make his guys work for free and put a car up more than once, and that he can refuse service to anyone at any point. There was no reason for him to go off on us the way he did, and especially retrieve his promise! He was very unprofessional. After that we went to the car, but I decided to go ask him who was his boss or manager/owner of the business. I asked him who was in charge of him he said "Me" and then I asked him if he was the owner of the shop he said No. So then I asked him for the owners information, and he refused to give it to me. Instead he said the owner would be there within the hr, after the business is closed of course! I'll never recommend this place to any one ever! The customer service has been horrible, and apparently Michael has a power trip about Refusing Service to Anyone & Being his Own Boss! I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED in OVERALL!

P.S When we got the smog checked the past two times they took over an 1hr because they kept servicing people right after us, since they seen it as quick money! HORRIBLE!</review>

Slightly higher priced compared to other shop nearby (Ramona’s Tire & Automotive) for replacement of ac compressor and clutch in my vehicle. Attendant seemed more like a salesman rather than a consultant you could trust. They said that my car was safe to drive on without repair even though the serpentine belt could have failed due to the seized up compressor clutch on my drive back to AZ. Glad I looked it up before driving home with no AC. Got it fixed at Ramona’s (Winchester Rd) who stayed open 2 hrs after closing on a Sunday to finish repair and saved $200 and made it home safely.  Redhawk staff were friendly enough but I didn’t feel very comfortable with such a significant repair so far from home based on interaction with the sales rep.<//Review>

< review>
Red hawk was great , I am giving  my cube to my daughter as for reals she was given a scholarship to the university of  Missouri in the 11 grade so I wanted to fix it  . The service writer “Manny” was good to scheduale an appt and fix drums and   pads on brakes...next he inspected the car with the oil change he let me know it had a leak and needed tires for the ride to Missouri cause they were woren below the 4/32 on the front and I had the oil pan gasket replaced and during the tune up the sparks are under the exhaust manifolds and had to be removed... he checked the timing and and replaced the timing belt and flushed the radiator cause he had it off and it hadn’t been done.... They were so kind.... manny called when it was finished and let me know he’d like to test it out so he held the held the car an extra day so he could have my rims polished and car detailed next store.The estimate was 5000 he was able to reduce it to 4000 as he went along and was adament  to call with progression up dates.... he was thoughtful enough to give me a packet that should any thing go wrong It’s covered at any auto garage for the trip home
I give manny and crew five stars he ‘s the man thanks for all you do.. also,
Thank you to all the kind staff at RED HAWK AUTO!

Wow what a great experience it was at this facility. Being new to the area and just buying my girlfriend a used car I needed to get it Smogged. Living in Arizona this was new to me. But wow what can I say from beginning to end what a great experience. Customer service was excellent and service was started immediately on my vehicle. Great group of workers at the facility nice and friendly the staff was just amazing. They will forsure get my business when I need more auto repairs done.< /Text>

Thank you to the entire team at Redhawk Auto...!!  I have taken my 2010 Equinox there for every single oil change and for MANY other reasons..  Every time my car has an issue the team is there to listen with kind ears, willingly accept my vehicle in an efficient manner and patiently explain the diagnosis.  They have then worked hard to successfully fix the issue and return my car to me so that I don't miss out on a day of work .. (as I work out of town).  I highly suggest them to all of my friends and plan to continue receiving my services from this great team of highly skilled and dedicated individuals..

Just wanted to say that I've been going to Redhawk Auto Service for a few years now. They are always friendly and treat me well. This last time (today), they informed me that the cap that goes on the oil pan had stripped out, and they replaced it at the last service (but hadn't mentioned it to me). Unfortunately, now the oil pain itself had stripped out, and my pan was now leaking and could not be sealed without some type of work or a new pan. I was surprised and disappointed that I had not been told of the situation before. Michael (the manager) took care of it. They didn't charge me a cent to fix the problem, and I left there a happy camper. Thank you to Michael and Redhawk Auto Service. They are focused on customer service and making sure you are taken care of. If you want an auto service facility that treats you like a person, and cares, this is a great place to go. :)< /review>

I was contacted by the Manager of Redhawk Auto, Chad, and he was very apologetic about the events that took place. He asked me to please bring the van back in, and they would make "it right". My faith in Redhawk Auto has been restored, as they corrected the problem, FREE OF CHARGE !! ONCE AGAIN I HAVE A SAFE VEHICLE TO DRIVE !!  This review is by Carol Larkins, as my husband is disabled and unable to handle car issues.  Thank you Redhawk Auto, for turning a negative issue into a very positive one !!!  I appreciate that you care about your customers !!

This is a five star plus review well earned... I broke down outside Temecula and was towed to Redhawk without any knowledge of who they were.  They diagnosed my car, let me know it wasn't worth repairing, didn't charge me a dime, and were extremely helpful. Sean, the manager, was upfront, honest, and easy to talk with. Even though I wasn't from the area they treated me and my vehicle as a priority and made a bad situation more than bearable. You have to respect a mechanic who won't take your money and still helps. Temecula, you have a great mechanic and shop. Sean and Redhawk are incredible!</text>

<text>Robbery.  Mechanic quoted a price and did the job.  When it was time to pay the Manager, Mike, increased the price.  I called the Mechanic over and he agreed with the price he originally quoted me.  The Manager said too bad.  I called the Sheriff.  Sheriff arrived and interviewed Mechanic and Manager and determined I was correct.  Sgt arrived and told the Manager I would be paying the original quoted price.  Sheriff filed a police report.

We at Redhawk have the knowledge and experience to know one the most important parts of repairing a vehicle is properly diagnosing the vehicle.  An improper diagnosis could lead to you spending more money than you have to.  Our diagnostic technician is ASE Master Certified and has over 15 years experience as well as a giant toolbox full of diagnostic equipment he used to diagnose your vehicle correctly and efficiently.  We know other shops may tell you they apply the cost of the diagnostic to the repair, but generally they just add it into the cost of the repair.  You pay for it anyways, so we'd rather be upfront and truthful with you about it."}</Response><Review>a little surprised that the diagnostic fees were not waived/reduced when the cost was over $600 for repairs. Service great other than that.< /Review>< date>

I went in panicked on Sunday afternoon because my car wouldn't start! I went in & Sean (I think that was his name, maybe Shane) was very polite & assured me that they would be able to figure out what was wrong with my car in enough time for me to make it to work! The gentleman there were very kind & super helpful! I will only go here from now on!<//review>

This place is so packed, I had to wait twenty minutes just to speak to someone for barely two seconds. Nowhere to park and god forbid you get into accident just driving into this place. Forget it. There's better service somewhere else.<//Text>

Well I wanted to shop around to get the best price Dealership was $250.00  Pep boys was the same but with an attitude  I stopped by Redhawk auto center they were $210.00 so I had them do the work a week later it started to leak again Redhawk said bring it back..they worked on and also found the front end axel was also damaged when I came in to pick my car up, they wouldn't charge me for the Axel I asked him how much the axle cost I was told Retail $150.00 but it didn't cost them that much.  When I asked him why I'm not been charged he said because they didn't catch it the first time,    An Honest Auto Center. I'm a customer for life.< /Review>< pics>

I have been frequenting Redhawk Auto Repair for several years now, even though I am closer to a competitor's location.  Why?  Because every time I have ever brought in my vehicles, whether it be for smog inspection, tune up, oil change or any other problem I've had, they have treated me with competence and fairness and quite simply, have earned my trust.  Despite a few management changes over the years, and the natural apprehension that goes through anyone's mind when that happens (after all, we get used to working with individuals and develop a rapport), I have never been let down by Redhawk Auto, which leads me to conclude that their outstanding customer service and honesty in dealing with the customer must start from the top down, with the owner, Tom.  I had a very frustrating problem with a broken emergency brake cable that snapped recently.  Parts had to be ordered, etc, but Rehawk Auto was very kind in working with me and to make up for the delay, even provided the parts at their cost, which I appreciated.  They didn't have to do that, but they offered to.  That's just how they are over there.  ALSO, their new "concierge" service is GREAT!!  Josh and Shane arrived at my doorstep.  Both men were neat, clean and very polite.   I handed them the keys and they took my vehicle in for repair and then delivered it back to my home once the repairs were completed - at no additional charge!  I have NEVER experienced that kind of level of service from ANY other independent garage or even dealership before.  You simply cannot find service like this anywhere.  Online service scheduling and their new concierge pickup and delivery service are the ultimate in convenience.  Brilliant!!  I am a very, very satisfied customer and so grateful that I have a local shop like this that I can TRUST.  I'm 55-years-old and have been driving for a long time, have dealt with many places, and this is the best shop I've ever encountered.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80db7f5841fe0a93:0x7390a315d4f36628</Gmap_id><review>I had an electrical issue with my wife's car.  I called Redhawk auto on a Saturday and explained the issue. Alex was very nice and let me know how they would diagnose the issue. He said "90% of the time" we find out the problem with the initial diagnosis. My wife drop the car off on Monday. Monday afternoon i get a call from Alex telling they need another $130 diagnosis because they think it is the body control module "BCM". Tuesday they call me and tell me the BCM is bad and they need to order a new one from Hyundai. I aaked how much for all the work required, they tell me $1,400. I ask how much Hyundai is asking for the part Alex tells me $500. I had done some internet research after my conversation with them on Monday and knew I had other repair options available including buying a used BCM or sending mine out to get repaired. I asked for details about what Was included in the $1400, it turns out they were going to charge me $200 to program the BCM even though it comes programmed from the factory and they were going to charge me over $400 for the install which they "accidentally" doubled the number of hours for the install. So they charge me $850 and get the work done.  I still had a anxiety because of the multiple mistakes and misleading statements. I asked them for the part receipt from Hyundai. They said that is confidential.  Turns out they lied to me when i asked them specifically how much Hyundai wanted for the part.  I found it on a hyundai dealer website for $270 retail.  Redhawk probably paid less than that wholesale, then turned around and charged me over $500.  I understand mechanics mark up parts, but special order parts, that i offered to order, shouldn't have a 100% markup.  They also lied.  Dont trust Sean, the manager.  He is very shady and unprofessional.</review>< user_name>

<review>These guys are rockstars.   I have a high mileage car and every time I take it in, they are very responsive to fix the issue but more importantly they don't try to push service on me that I don't need.  I have always taken my car to the dealer to get major work on it but have been taking it to Michael and team for the last 3 years and I will never use the dealer again.   I highly recommend using them.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>I went in to check a possible leak on one of the tires.  They said they found a small leak and patched it up.  Problem is that they put in 58 psi which is almost twice of the recommended tire pressure which is 34 psi.  In the receipt, it stated that tire pressure is checked and they put in recommended 34 psi.  If my car wasn't equipped with tire pressure monitor, I would have driving it believing that my tire had right amount of pressure.  Also, 3 of 4 tires' air caps were missing.  So I went back to the shop to deflate the tire and get the missing caps.  Interestingly, the electronic tire pressure gage at the shop was not working, so he ended up deflating the tire while checking with my car tire pressure monitor.   I didn't receive any apology from its staff on this mishaps.<//Text>< pictures>

This place is AMAZING! NOT ONCE BUT TWICE did they go in and correct the mistakes of other mechanic shops on me and my husband's cars. They were VERY helpful and extreamly nice. Me and my husband went in seperstely on two separate occassions and both recieved the same great service. They are extreamly efficent and fair! Oh and when I needed a complete tune up and alignment a year ago, I left my brand new ipad mini , smart watch, and ither important documents in my bag. There was no identifiable information, so they took my items home and found a way to call my friend from my ipad and let her know I left my items and could pick them up from the shop. They are absolutely amazing and the type of peolme and business this world needs. Honest and hard working people that truely want to help others! This is definitely my shop of choice.< /Text>

My fiancé has been here before for a couple of oil changes and some general maintenance, I always thought pricing was a little shady but this time nailed it on the head. The vacuum pump needed to be replaced on her 2008 Jetta, she was quoted $1,600 parts and labor!!! We took it down the road to a mechanic on Front Street, was quoted $525 parts and labor. RedHawk Auto Service FAIL!!< /Text>

{'time': 1525984885098, 'text': "Hello Criss, thanks for coming in and we really appreciate you trying out RedHawk Auto Service. We tried to contact you a couple times about your review, but haven't heard back from you.  When you came into our shop you let us know that when you turned off your vehicle it would not re-start and required jump-starting.  Our shop was full at the time and as with most days, we were very busy.  However, given the vehicle was in immediate need of being diagnosed, we let you know we would help you as long as you could leave the car with us.  By the time we had spoken about your vehicle in the afternoon, your car was next to get looked at.  I hope you can understand that we needed to take care of our clients' vehicles that were already in the shop and had appointments to be serviced.  In the future, an appointment would let us know you were coming in and we could serve you a little quicker.  Our technicians are highly trained and Master Certified and are more than capable of diagnosing any issue with your vehicle.  All we ask is that we can get the proper time to spend on each vehicle to give the vehicle and the customer the best service possible.  If we can be of any assistance in the future please let us know."}<//response>
