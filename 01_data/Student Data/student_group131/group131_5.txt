This was my drink...I asked for light ice and you can still see there's a good amount of ice. When I asked if they could remake it he asked me what was wrong with it. Lol "where's the rest of my drink?" I was so embarrassed as people around were listening. He just added more cream and I left.</text>

<review>The attitude of these Starbucks employees were entitled kids with no respect and poor training in customer service. Sorry Starbucks, you need better supervision for these children!</review>< name>

<text>Went in to get a drink with my grandma. We were the only ones there. Ordered our drinks, took them 30 mins! After they made it, they never called it out. The lady and the guy sat there flirting instead. Lady said that she forgot. After waiting, the drinks were all wrong. We were so mad at waiting we just wanted to leave. Even saw another lady complain about her drink as well during this time. Went home to poor my drink out, it was so gross.</text><time>1561508132516<//time><Name>corin cargile<//Name><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

<Text>The staff are great, fast, friendly and efficient. Tim, Mariel and everyone else that we meet in the morning are great. They treat you like family calling you by name if you are a regular customer. The place is always busy especially in the morning.

Maybe a tad early on Christmas, but who isn't?  Always a pleasure going into a Starbucks that's clean, fast, and friendly and they even really know your name!  Can sometimes be too busy, but always worth the wait.  If youre in a hurry a classic cup of brewed coffee is the fastest way to get in and out and you can doctor it up however you'd like... win win!</Review>

Coffee was fine, but the employees here are lousy. They did not acknowledge our presence for a full 5 minutes after entering the store. And no, they weren't busy.

Go to another location if you can.< /review>

RUDE RUDE AND RUDE! Rude service from a barista who thought I wouldn't notice she put regular milk in my frappe just because I also wanted whipped cream. I even told her i wanted coconut milk, and I knew she was going to ignore my request when she asked if I wanted whipped cream still. She doesn't know if I was lactose intolerant but willing to pay a small personal price (was MORE than a small personal price yesterday) for the whipped cream or if it went against my religious beliefs. Starbucks needs to hire honest workers who deserve jobs not lazy high school students.

Barista was kinda chubby and pretty with dark hair and fair skin working yesterday 12/21/2018 at 1pm, so watch out for her if your drink is more complex than the usual order. I'm surprised Starbucks doesn't enforce the "customer is always right" policy when it comes to their own personal order that they will be drinking.< /Text>

If you go early morning its great service but around the second or third shift (~9am) they get two employees busting their ass and one or two more employees that either do a lax job or not working at all. Today I watched a girl (I assume she was the manager?) Just take her time walking from the back room to the floor not really helping any of the other employees. She took someones order but then severly took her time with it. Probably about the third time Ive seen this too. Makes the line go to the door and orders take about 10 min longer than they need to.</text>

< Review>
Terrible service. Person ahead in line  ordered about 20 coffees. 4 people working. One cashier and one barista. Instead of taking person aside and bringing another person up to help. the barista spent his time helping person figure out their order and put making coffees on hold. Another person standing around watching. I understand order was large but could have organized better< /Review>

The morning crew have really bad attitudes. They force your ordering. They don't smile. They talk with frustration. I hate coming here in the morning. Afternoon shift are a lot lot better.</review>

<review>Worst Starbucks I’ve ever been! Me and my husband had to wait about 10 minutes to order and it took over 20 minutes to get our drink, it was not busy at all.

Got my drink wrong. Said no whip and nonfat for a frap and somehow I got a cream version of coffee somewhere in there. Oh well, there is one on every corner. I'll go to another corner next time.< /Review>

Food is good.  But twice in two weeks I’ve been in.  First time they said bathroom being remodeled.   Second time still closed.  They all wear a mask for Health ( of course).  But provide no where to wash your hands before you eat     Seems hypocritical</Text>

The crew I just dealt with at this location was fast, friendly, and professional! When a team member had to ask customers to wait outside as the lobby would exceed the 6 person max, she was firm but polite. Great food as always! I hope owners have the ability to give bonuses to these hard workers, especially since there is no ability to electronically add a tip! So rarely do people carry cash anymore, so the crews perhaps get shorted on their deserving tips. 😢<//Review>

<text>Great food! The best, but at the Paso Robles store today I was reprimanded by the day manager. I was picking up an order I was early. I gave the name on the order, she told me to"come back"I waited outside for 10 minutes. I went back in and I was the 5th person and at the scheduled time for pick up. I am very aware of Covid rules and the number of customers as yours are posted on the door. She came over to me and started very aggressively said "she told me to come back". She spoke to me like I was a child, asked me if I read the sign.She put an order on the pick up table name facing her. She rudely (although she said I'm not being rude, she was and everyone in the store heard her) asked for my name and my last name then she turned the bag so I could see the name and go. As I was walking to my car a customer said that not right. That's the reason for this</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Work crew didn’t seem very interested in doing things right, just getting it done. The card reader wasn’t working but I wasn't told this until I had entered my card info by hand 3 times, constantly touching the key pad that was obviously not being wiped down with each use (as witnessed for guests before me). There were 3 workers and 4 people in the lobby, which was starting to feel a little packed so I’m was trying to get my stuff done and get out. Got lots of attitude from the young lady running the register because I was obviously getting frustrated at her lack of communication and interaction. Plus I had to lean way over the counter to get my food since she was not going to hand it to me. My sandwiches were barely wrapped. One cut in half the other in 5 separate pieces. Food was good but the experience was not!!!</Review>< Pictures>

I like their sandwiches but they are extremely slow. Ordering in store takes a long time so I thought I’d order online and then pick up. That was a mistake! I ordered postmates and I got a notification that my order wouldn’t be ready for 45 minutes after waiting 10 minutes. So almost an hour for two sandwiches to be made....<//Review>

< Review>
I am a big fan of Jersey Mike’s subs but what I received today was a HUGE letdown!  I ordered a giant #7, my usual order, but received a sub that looks like it was made on a grocery store baguette!  1/2 the size of the gourmet in store baked roll that I usually get and definitely not enough to feed 4.  Definitely not worth what I paid for or what I expected!  So NOT a “sub above”!< /Review>

Very tasty sandwiches! It's always a great meal, and I've never had an issue with the staff. I usually go with one of their cheese steaks but their cold subs are also delicious. The desert options are a must as well. The manager on duty tonight was having to deal with a rude and unreasonable customer ahead of me and I though she handled the situation very well. This is a very good option for a quick meal.< /text>

Wow. Place says they are open at 10am. We arrived at 10:10am and waited outside for 5 minutes until finally one of the employees finally walked to the door and taped a hand written sign right in front of us that said they aren’t going to open until 10:30am. Horrible customer service. You can see us and we can see you inside making sandwiches. We are waiting until 10:30am just to make a point.< /Text>

Great hoagies. They'll make them to order or take them as Mike specifies, either way is great. The only thing I don't care for is the roll. I wish he had a crispy Italian roll. There's no flavor to his rolls at all. The price is steeper than most sandwich shops, but worth it.<//review>

I was a little let down after all the hype on the TV. It was my first visit and I was expecting more. It seemed popular, the bread is very good which is lucky because part of my Reuben had no meat. I may or may not give them another try, not really sure right now. If I do I'll amend this post.< /review>

By no means is Jersey Mike's as good as Capiotti's IMO, but it is a close second in the 'national chain' subway category, again IMO.

I found their food super fresh, the facility spotless, and the counter help very adequate. While I wasn't impressed with the amount of meat my sub held between it's halves, I wouldn't say it was skimpy...just average in ounces.

The parm roll on the other hand, was simply marvelous.< /review>

< review>
Rude business model? I was third in a line of seven customers, but was the ONLY customer singled out to pay first before they would even start making my sandwich. I watched them make sandwiches for two other customers in front of me as we waited to pay. Each customer, except me, was handed their sandwich as they paid. I waited in the same line, ordered from the same menu, but nobody paid any attention to my sandwich until AFTER I paid. Meanwhile, I stood I watched two more customers get served immediately as I was waiting for my sandwich.

I spoke to the asst. manager, and she said that was standard practice for a grilled sandwich. So, if you like being disrespected because you want a hot sandwich, it looks like Jersey Mike's is the place. Really, what kind of business model is that? Pay for hot sandwiches first? Cold sandwiches go to the front of the line? Whatever happened to good old first come, first served? Rude.< /review>

<text>These are the best subs we've found in SLO County. Try the #5...and always always have it "Mike's way" They know what they're doing. I would give five stars for the sandwiches alone, but took off one star as the service, while friendly, can be hit and miss with speed and efficiency.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80ecc4c4dc7942f3:0x99be92951653139b< /Gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>Jersey Mike's started their business on the coast of New Jersey and now made it all the way to California, that alone speaks for itself. Excellent sub sandwiches and for the diet conscience person they have any sub you want without the bread called  SUB IN A TUB. That was an awesome healthy meal. Thank you.</Review>< Rating>

They can get quite busy, but they are all so friendly and quick! Favorite is the original Italian (add mayo & pickles plz!)

I enjoy the rewards perks. We eat here often so we've earned a lot of free subs and drinks. Can't beat that!!< /Text>

<Text>As many a business seems to do, they started great and.........now their service just plain Ol SUCKS!!! Last four times always a problem. ALWAYS seem to be out of something. Again a bit ago ordered online to get the usual call.....um we are out of that. Haven't been in awhile because of that and prior time couldn't find anyone in store who could refund our credit card, as we canceled seeing as they didn't have and they had to call a manager at home to approve and the did next day. Just also cancelled this order. Don't bother with this incompetent business.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80ecc4c4dc7942f3:0x99be92951653139b< /Gmap_id>< rating>

Staff was friendly but seemed frazzled, there were only 2 employees working at the time. The counter where the sandwiches where being made was really dirty and was not cleaned in between sandwich's the employee making the sandwiches left twice while making the sandwichs. The lobby was a disaster every table was dirty. The employee noticed that and offered to wipe our table down which was nice but I would not come back to this location.<//review>

This was my second time at this location. The first time, my sandwich bread was so dry and crumbly, I choked on crumbs. Very unenjoyable. My second experience was met with the same dry bread and also they were unable to make half of their menu items due to lack of inventory. The employees in the back were aloof and not concerned with the spilled soda and trashy lobby. Horrible experience.. will never go back.</Text>

<text>Stopped in to play pool and have a beer, we couldn't sit at the bar due to the only 2 seats available had a rag in front of them on top of the bar soaking up blood. I guess we had just missed a fight prior to us arriving. It was so hot inside that I had to go outside 5 times in the 45 minutes that we were there. I had a paper towel from the bathroom that I was using to wipe my face and neck off because the sweat was pouring down my face. Very uncomfortable environment tonight.< /text>< user_id>

<Review>Good price on drinks! Games & juke box music!The bartenders are mellow & do their job well! Super small town, everyone knows everyone! It's been around here awhile so its well known. Their beer on draft is AMAZING! Def check it out one night. Easy to find, right next to circle K, parking in back!<//Review>< user_name>

Best place for cocktails in Ramona! Even first timers are treated like family. It's not fancy...but a great place to spend some time. Pool table, 2 soft tip dart boards. Awesome bartenders. But Don't sit in the red chair<//text>

<rate>3</rate><review>Your typical small town local bar/pool hall. The ceiling is very high, not a lot on the walls to absorb sound so it's like a echo chamber. However, the customers are friendly & the drinks are a decent pour at a fair price. If your looking for some local "flavor" with your drink, I recommend this place.<//review>< Pics>

The food is kinda good, I call and get told the food is gonna be in 20 minutes and when I go and get the food.its still not ready. I have one hour and 30 minutes of waiting for the food, I keep being told " Its going to be ready im 10 minutes". So Unprofessional< /review>

They were so wonderful.  Food was awesome.  They accommodated our large group coming from Sacramento late, so we really appreciated that. So many choices to choose from. I recommend the Carne Asada!!< /Review>

The staff here is always welcoming and helpful. Plenty of parking and it's easy to get in and get out. If you aren't familiar with it's location, you could just pass right by it without ever seeing it.<//Review>

If your are looking for a 5 min haircut this is not the place. I have had 3 different barbers here and they have all taken their time and are very detail oriented which is something I appreciate  greatly.</text>

Mike was super quick to respond to my calls. We enjoyed working with him, great customer service! We had him do a full service and are thrilled with the work. Installing the bird screens around our solar panels was a must and Mike did a terrific job! Totally recommend using them and will most likely call them again when we need gutters cleaned and windows washed. Super happy with this experience!<//text>

MIKE WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND RESPECTFUL.  WORE SHOE PROTECTORS UPON ENTERING HOME AND WORE A FACE MASK.  DID A GREAT JOB CLEANING THE WINDOWS INSIDE AND OUT.  ALSO DID A EXCELLENT JOB CLEANING THE SCREENS.  DO NOTICE HOME IS MUCH BRIGHTER WITH THE CLEAN WINDOWS.  WOULD USE MIKE AND HIS WIFE AGAIN.  I WISH MIKE ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WINDOW CLEANING BUSINESS.   HE IS VERY GOOD,  MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SURE.< /text>

<Review>I loved the service you have provided. He (unfortunately I don't know his name) did a fantastic job. Very professional, had his mask on and kept his 6 feet distance. Also after the job was done, he explained in detail what was done.  I really appreciated it. Looking forward to the next scheduled service, window cleaning. Thank you again.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>“You get what you pay for” is apropos when using Hikari window cleaning! Mike and Samantha run their business like true professionals. The combination of their easy to use appointment system, communication, coordination, and attention to detail are a few of the reasons why we will continue to use Hikari for future services and refer them to our friends, family, and neighbors.

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Mike and Samantha are a husband and wife team. Together they did my windows better than anybody we've ever hired. The last people we hired came with a team, were here for a very short time and it was obvious. Mike and Samantha came out to give me an estimate. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They gave me a quote that was very reasonable. He also said he would make a new screen that I needed for one of our upstairs windows. That was extra, but not much, and totally worth it. Samantha did a great job of vacuuming my window sills and cleaning the screens and Mike washed my windows. He did an amazing job. Not one squeegee line on any of my windows. I have never seen them look cleaner. I highly recommend Hikari Window Cleaning. Not only is their service excellent, but I love giving the job to really great people.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Mike and co were extremely professional, personable and respectful of our property. Our windows look AMAZING! And our solar output has increased. I have tried cleaning my windows in the past and, although it took the dirt off, I always left streaks. Mike did not. They look CRYSTAL CLEAR and BEAUTIFUL! We 100% recommend them and look forward to using their services in the future.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Beautiful area.  Lots to see.  Trails are defined.  Good area to hike, think, and observe nature.  You see a few people, but not a crowded trail.  The views are amazing.  It was nice hiking with my husband and dogs.  Take lots of water.  There are some trails that are pretty steep.  You will see birds, lizards, and bees.  If you get up early, the temps are very pleasant.  Great experience and we can't wait to get out and do it again.<//Review>

It was very easy for my kids, 3 and 5. A few slips climbing on rocks. Be sure to wear long pants as there are tons of poison oak. Not sure where it ends but we stopped when the trail looked like it was continuing on in water.< /review><Time>1593033620052<//Time><rate>5< /rate><user_name>haejung a</user_name><user_id>103148337848222608285< /user_id>< resp>

<username>cesia ixchop< /username><review>This hiking trail is a workout on your legs! It is a looooooong incline hike! You just keep going up the steep hills and when you think it’s over it’s not. Definitely take a hat and lots of water because there isn’t any shade at all to rest. Parking is right next to the start of the trail. It’s a pretty nice place. Good luck.<//review>< rate>

<review>(three stars for communication)

I was referred here by a business associate and liked their price. You have to drive a bit more maybe, but worth it.

The ladies here are nice, but they have RULES and if you don't like their RULES, then you're out.  This is what I was told when I signed up.  In fact, I inquired very gently on the walk through, in a calm voice, as to why a certain lock was required (I haven't had storage in five years) and I was told matter of factly (in a harsh tone) that if I didn't agree with the lock requirement, I was free to shop around and "let them know" if I was still interested.  I could tell she has had a lot of inquiries like this and was probably ready for a fight.  But, I wasn't trying to have a fight.  I wanted to know why I had to have a lock that you don't normally see.  I looked up the lock on Amazon and it was a buck less than theirs so I bought it here.

I have been selling for 25 years and I sell a very serious and complicated product called insurance. If my associates treated my customers like this, I would have a lot of coaching time with them as to how to enforce rules, but also speak in gentle tones and to outline the reason for such rules. After this encounter, I walked into the office to find on the wall three or four nice bullet points of the actual "whys" related to the lock.  I imagine had Liz simply said "there are a few reasons... x, y, and z" like the poster I would have been satisfied.  She would have seemed like she knew her product and service as well.  My trust level for her would have sky rocketed.  Now, I worry I'm always on the line, waiting to be kicked out.

Her other focus was that if I were to ever stay late past gate hours, "I would be locked in and have to call the cops" to get me out after which I would be asked to leave the storage unit as a customer.  Wow.  Ok.  I get it.  Homelessness in LA is serious.  No boarders.  But, again, coaching needed here.  I drove up in a 2019 Volvo and presented my platinum Amex. (with which I immediately set up auto-pay)  Probably not going to shack up at StorAmerica.  I saw by the looks of one tenant giving them gruff, that there are possibly folks here that may not live in standard housing.  That's ok and I'm sure it can be a drag to deal with all the time.  But, again, learn a bit about your customer before you assume he'll break all the rules in two minutes, ESPECIALLY if I was referred to you.  You could lose two good clients. You don't know how tight I am with your referral.

The price is fair, the place is very clean, and I feel like my things are safe.  After our first encounter, Liz and I were able to work together. The "free" truck is nice and I used it to my benefit.  I think Liz and Darlene mean well and care about their jobs and the space, but please... coaching!  Gentle.  Nice. Smile a lot.  You'll find your day will be less stressful.  Thank you.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1578767761564, 'text': 'Hello Charles, thank you for your feedback.

Really enjoy this storage facility. My husband and I have been here for years with no issues. We moved out last year just to find a closer storage, but ended up moving back in about 6 months later. The other place was just too small and pricey even for an upstairs unit and didn't even have a sprinkler system!

Liz was very good and accommodating. She helped us to easily move in especially with a nice move-in special. We have a 1st floor unit and it's still cheaper than the other storage place that was on the 2nd floor!

It's a bit farther out, but I think in the end worth it!

Thank you Lizz & Darlene for your help in providing us with another great storage unit.

<Text>Fairly reasonable priced compare to other self storage in the area. They at least keep the pricing up front, some places will promise a lower rate, then charge 50% higher claiming they are for insurance. This place is pretty up front. They also offer a free moving truck rental for the day you move. Make sure you reserve few days or weeks in advance as they only have one. The storages are not climate controlled, but it's not facing the sun, so it doesn't get very hot.< /Text><name>Hock<//name>< Date>

<review>I came looking for storages in the area and happened to stop here. Looks really small from the outside but inside is a whole different story. The gate hours are perfect for me and the storage sizes as well. Daniel and Darlene provided me excellent customer service. They showed me a few units and took the time to go over everything with me. Since my escrow didnt clear I was unable to rent but I strongly recommend coming here if you are looking for a clean and safe storage place. Thanks again to the team members up in the front office for assisting me. Daniel and Darlene!

It was awesome, Daniel did a great job of showing me my storage unit, the cart, and multitasking, he took care of another lady and I at the same time. I was surprised and very pleased with the security and safety of StorAmerica. I've used other storages and they really can't compare to the quality of care and safety of StorAmerica. Thank you so very much and Kudos for Daniel.
God bless you all!! Claudia Zepperi</text>

<Text>StorAmerica is the best option when it comes to storing your belongs. I'm in the process of moving between houses and I'm waiting for the remodeling to be complete before I move all my things in so I needed a storage unit for the meantime. I heard of this affordable option through a friend and since I've had bad experiences with the other options out there(Public Storage) I decide to give StorAmerica a try. I was surprisingly impressed with the cost and availability of their storage units. Not to mention my sales associate Daniel P. was very knowledgeable, polite and honest. He even talked me out of over spending on a larger unit by showing me several other comparisons. He spent almost an hour with me showing me rental options and even helped me estimate my actual storage needs. I will only do business with StorAmerica in the future be sure to ask for Daniel or Darlene they were great and made the moving process that much easier!< /Text>< pics>

I was shopping around and darlene found me a unit for a great rate so i decided to rent with her. She had awesome customer service skills and helped me find the right size. I truly recommend storamerica and darlene if you are looking for storage. They are all very nice at this location.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>Did all the research and read all the reviews, decided to go with this company, initially the service was great, I called in a day early, scheduled a time to look at units and showed up.  Was showed two units, at a promotional price, great so far..secured a unit for my move, I later determined I needed a LARGER unit, called in and spoke to the Rep who was NOT anybody mentioned in the reviews.  They refused to honor the price for the promotion on the larger unit. I know, my bad luck right? I should have taken the larger unit when offered, HOWEVER, IF this company offers a price match, and IF they are concerned with customer satisfaction, and IF they prefer I stay instead of leaving after my time paid for is up, (at my expense for the principle of it), then shouldn't the company accommodate my request in stead of LOSING the business outright? NOTE: another "option" not mentioned anywhere BEFORE renting is that they allow law enforcement to train on the premises and make you sign a waiver to search your unit at anytime. I have nothing to hide in my junk, but it seems to me in this era of violation of privacy issues and government involvement in our lives, I just as soon not have them snooping through my junk at any time for any reason. If I would have known this BEFORE agreeing to the whole process, I would have taken my business elsewhere and avoided this whole mess.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>NOT VERY HAPPY! I have been a custoner for aprx. 5 years now and for my dedication as loyal customer they are raising my rent again. This time an additional 20.00 per month. When i started renting here i was told i was getting a 10x10 lockerb, but after a got it i tried putting a 9.5ft long work table i have, but to my surprise it didnt fit by 1 ft. Actual size of the room 8.5x8.5ft. I took the table apart to make it fit. They do have a sign in the front office which makes it okay to false advertise. (Actual size could be different)But now with this rent increase, im going to move. I like this place but not the slaps in the face for loyalty. Only way i would stay now is if they drop my rent to what it was when i moved in and keep it there untill i move out 20 years from now. Or my loyalty will start at a different storage facility.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Dont like the fact that they dont provide a monthly bill.  No email alert, no phone call, no warning.  If you forget to pay 'bam" outrageous late fees!!  You just have to remember to pay.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This warehouse company is the worst storage warehouse I have seen in the Los Angeles area. ❗️ Yesterday I registered this company to store furniture online. Today I have to ask for warehouse information and open the storage key. The attitude of their front desk staff is very poor. And it’s very unkind to say that you are not the only Storage in Los Angeles! Storage is very bad. It’s still on the second floor. I want to change to another location. Since the storage service staff said that they can’t change or refund, it’s really irritating. Let everyone know that you don’t want to rent Storage here in the future. Their service The attitude and Storage are really disappointing, there are other better warehouses to look for other Storage!

這一家倉庫公司是我在洛杉磯區域看到最爛的一家儲存倉庫❗️昨天上網登記了這家公司儲存傢俱，今天要去索取倉庫資料及開Storage key，他們的前台服務人員的態度非常的差，而且說話非常的不客氣，整個洛杉磯也不是只有你們一家Storage！Storage非常的爛還在二樓，我想換其他的別的位置Storage服務人員既然說不能換也不能退款，這真讓人生氣，讓大家知道以後千萬別來這出租Storage，他們的服務態度還有Storage真讓人失望，有其他更好的倉庫可以尋找其他的Storage！<//Text>

<Review>This place is really good. I was a great fan of their service and options. Even when they had a lot of people, they managed it very well. They have self service ipads for ordering which moves things super fast. The service is quick. The tea was good and they had great flavors.</Review>< Date>

<text>Loved my TieGuanYin milk tea! A nice, strong hit of tea for sure, but not too bitter that it overpowers the drink. Got it at 50% sweetness and less ice, and thought it was perfect- not diluted too much nor too little, and still sweet enough!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>I craved a boba in Berkeley after an early dinner. So I decided to give this place a try. I liked the idea of having two touch screen devices to order drinks. There's a sign stating customers to wait outside after ordering. But a staff didn't even shout the numbers to let people know that their drinks were ready. Personally speaking, the drink was alright and the boba were quite small and soft. This place is not my type of boba.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Tea was good with plenty options for boba, jelly, and beans. Also able to customize it exactly the way you want, just like other boba shops. I'm not a boba fan, but can attest to the grass jelly and red beans, good stuff. Cup size is limited, however, with 22 oz the primary size. Service however, was slow, especially with 6 workers on the floor. Guess they have tons of orders from those delivery apps? Expect to wait 10+ mins, so definitely order ahead of time for pickup.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Yes. Always yes. Someone told me about this place and I thought why the hell not since I was in the area. Fresh milk tea with the smaller boba that's ever so slightly delicious with the right amount of chewyness and bite.

Has a surprisingly clean bathroom and nice hipster feel to the waiting area<//Text>

< Review>
Maybe I had an off-day with ordering :/

Strawberry Milk Tea with boba was not a good idea because the boba got really hard half way through and I couldn't even finish the drink. The drink is like a smoothie. I asked for less ice but got small chunks of ice in the drink. Not pleasant!
Pineapple Black Tea tasted strongly of dried pineapple, didn't like that either.

With that said, I did enjoy the Wintermelon Tea Latte and Taiwan Classic Milk Tea from the Cupertino location< /Review>

<review>I ordered 3 milk teas with boba and grassjelly, the amount they put in the cup are significantly less than the Cupertino store. I can barely see the grassjelly in the cup and the boba seem half the amount. Milk tea still tastes good though.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_4tScgc66lsO4YHU277z-3kNDQ-WJR37ukZCE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80857ddda31e7f19:0x28a22f197f4fcc45</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pretty limited tea selection. Only black, green, and oolong. For some reason they serve small boba in their pearl milk tea. Given Berkeley's Boba scene you can do better.</Text>

This WAS my favorite Thai restaurant in San Diego but seems to have declined in quality under new ownership. Perhaps I'm imagining it, but I think the prices are higher, the portions smaller, and the wait longer. Our food was decent but not excellent, with the exception of a side of stir-fried vegetables that seemed to be seasoned with nothing but garlic. We couldn't bring ourselves to finish it.< /Review>

Some of the best Thai food in San Diego. Call me basic, but my favorite menu items are the Pad Thai and green curry. Unlike a lot of other green curries in San Diego, the Saffron curry is full of fresh veggies.</Text>

<text>Where else can you say "Poodi" when ordering your food? I giggle every time I see it on the menu. Of course, I can also vouch for the tea leaf salad, samosa soup, a myriad of everything else. The place is a little crowded, and the line is worth the wait. If I can't spare the time, I get the order to go and enjoy the delicious meal at home.<//text>< Pictures>

I wish that I still loved this place.  Since Sui Mei sold it, the quality of the food has gone down hill substantially.  For the life of them, they CANNOT COOK CHICKEN. The chicken in every single dish I have had has been both tough AND flavorless.  Even the dipping sauces have lost flavor.  The Sweet Pepper sauce is now a lightly flavored sweet-tart, that makes Panda Express seem Michelin-star-worthy.  They killed the Southern Thai curry which was a revelation of flavors not often seen together. Even the salad rolls are now flavor-light and reminiscent of a bad airplane salad.   The Brain Food was one of my favorites - it had light and subtle flavor that pleasantly seasoned the kale, which can overwhelm a dish, while enhancing the sweet potato notes with spices and a little heat.  Now it is pretty much a bland sweet potato-kale casserole with all the flavor of a Sprouts freezer TV dinner.    I wish they had someone in their kitchen who knew what the food was supposed to taste like.  Unfortunately that's not what's happened.
While the former owner was a most unpleasant woman - I personally saw her scream and throw food at her staff, dress them down and humiliate them (on more than one occasion) and holler at customers who displeased her - she developed many incredibly delicious recipes. I only wish the new and very nice owners could have preserved her recipes and flavors better than they have.  I used to go there despite the owner and now I only go when I forget how disappointing the food is.  Alas...</text>

I've been meaning to add a review for a long time now but I've always held back because I like to give restaurants an opportunity and know that they can have a bad day. But I've repeatedly had bad days now with Saffron.

Today, 4/19/19 at around 5:09pm, I decided to stop by to buy some tofu rolls and brought them home. I came to realize that the tofu is  gone bad, the veggies old, and the rice sheet broke apart as I grabbed one.

I believe in second chances but I've given Saffron too many. It's not the cozy family own placed anymore.

I will avoid going here going forward and just wanted to share my thoughts.</Review>

Thai food and the atmosphere here is excellent. The food was so savory. I've had nothing but enjoyable experiences here and plan to keep visiting. This place has a cool atmosphere. Similar to a place in Denver I loved.</text>

thai food and the atmosphere at this location is excellent. Service is prompt even when they are busy. Certainly worth a return visit. The bill was good for how much you get.<//review>

Outstanding location for delicious Thai food. I love this place, excellent food & service. I had a brother come into town and asked me to take him back here. If it wasn't far from my work I would come by more.</text>

The lychee mint mojito has fresh ingredients and it's delicious. The coconut rice is a must and we enjoyed the mango beef but it was not as good as the beef.

Great Thai food place with lots to offer. I've been here a couple of times and it is NOT hit or miss. The chicken and sauce selection is delicious and the waiting time is never long. The staff and restaurant are clean and inviting. If you are looking for authentic Thai food, this is your place.<//Text>

Fine scene for delicious thai food. Arrived at seven, it wasn't crowded. I will be bringing friends next time. The prices are fair for the quality of food. Ambience is similar to Fresno's scene.< /text>

<Text>My first order was perfect i ordered for 1 Tofu Salad roll & Cambodian salad - it was delicious perfectly seasoned and well presented how ever the container was leaking which they should look for better option on packaging giving in to the present circumstances of more take out's than ever before. 2 nd order was a waste of time and ended being annoyed because by the time the order arrived and the box was opened the tofu salad roll was no longer in the wrap it was just lettuce and tofu with carrot did not enjoy the flavor nor was it convenient to eat  either they should buy a wrap that can  hold the ingredients together or simply know how much stuffing it needs and not over stuff it</Text>< Rating>

< Review>
Just went to saffron for the first time in a long while.  What a disappointment.   It tasted nothing like the saffron that I grew up with. Had the Pad Thai noodles and a shrimp spring roll.  The spring roll was small, and whoever prepared it didn't know how to roll it.  The Pad Thai.......  Was terrible.  Bad sauce,  oversauced. The small amount of noodles, were mushy.

From what I understand it has changed from the original owner.

Really bummed out that a staple of San Diego had fallen so far.<//Review>

The Saffron is a real good Egg Roll place.My wife likes their mango sticky rice. They have only two kinds of egg rolls a vegetable and a chicken. I only have had the chicken ones for the last 30 years they are great and don't forget to dip them in that sweet viniger sauce they give you !!</Text>

Do you like getting a large dish of rice with a few sprinkled pieces of meat on the top for $13? If so this is the place for you.  Taste was ok. Not spectacular. Was the first and last time I’ll eat here. Giving 2 starts instead of 1 bec I can’t judge on the other dishes. See photo below and judge for thyself.< /Text>

This restaurant is my favorite place.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this place. when  I want to go to a special lunch, this place comes straight to my mind. outstanding and many types of  food and a large menu.generous staff, and great spirit. Also important, the tariff is honest. I suggest this place with great pleasure.< /Review>

I called in the phone for just a fried rice
They told me 15 min
They made me wait 45 minutes and in the end i had to cancel my order because i couldn’t wait anymore
The worst restaurant and customer service ever honestly
All the people that came after while i was waiting had big orders and they all left before me</text>

Seemingly a good place, helpful & friendly staff - quite busy, but under-prepared management & requisitions create lengthy and unnecessary delays.  Avoid peak times, and probably fine.< /review>

Big Nope.
I like pad see ew. And I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to pad see ew. But the pad see ew here had no flavor. The beef and broccoli were cooked just fine, but the fried shallots or whatever (which doesn't belong on pad see ew anyway)  could not disguise the fact that the noodles were not properly sauced.
And I also got a half chicken dinner, because when 1/3 of the menu is dedicated to the roasted chicken, you give it a try, right? Mistake. The dark meat was mushy. Bad. The chicken had zero seasoning. Bad. And maybe I chose the wrong sauces, but everything that came with the dinner was overly sweet. The "Cambodian salad" was too sweet. The peanut sauce and chutney were way too sweet.
This was a huge disappointment of a meal.<//text>

<review>If this place was open in Thailand, it would probably go out of business. The sauces don't taste well. Satay chicken dry and over cooked. Cuisine does not smell Thai and I have been to Thailand 5 times. Don't know who they are trying to fool.</review>< gmap_id>

I ordered the shrimp and shiitake soup, it’s was good but really spicy, I’m Mexican, I like spicy, but to my taste it was too spicy. I couldn’t drink the broth. The shrimp salad rolls were good, great size. The peanut sauce was delicious, very homemade which I loved. I’m planning on tasting more dishes. The place was clean, service was good.

5 star food, 3 star service- food is fantastic. Many gluten free items. Staff has quick access to ingredients,  but seem put upon,  when asked. Food is clean, fresh and with a depth of flavor not often seen in reasonably priced restaurants. Small, comfortable (casual) seating areas.  Highly recommend if you are more concerned with food than friendly employees.< /Review>

This is a restaurant that operates slightly like a fast food restaurant in how they largely leave you alone but you order and pay up front.

The food is pretty fantastic and you can substitute noodles with gluten free noodles. The place is also comfortable and pretty inside.

Beware that parking is scarce. I walked a half mile to get there since everything near it was totally taken at the time.< /Review>

<review>I've been to this place 3 times now, and each time the food has been pretty bland. I guess they were better before the new management. Each chicken dish comes with a sauce of your choosing, but I feel like the chicken should have flavor regardless. After no luck with the chicken, I tried the fried rice on my last visit. It was pretty disappointing. Not much flavor, tasted more like mexican rice. The tables are always sticky.<//review><Rate>2< /Rate>< GmapID>

Absolutely the best place in San Diego for Thai food! We have been going here for years. The perfect place to order take out for any occasion. We have never had a bad meal here. The parking or lack thereof is our only complaint. I would suggest calling ahead for takeout. There are spots available for takeout.<//Text>

<Text>Best homeade peanut sauce! Super Food Salad didn't come with a cape but I felt like a superhero after! Mango sticky rice was so good I cried while eating it.

Understand it's under new management and/or ownership and it has gone down hill.  The food was bland at best.  Nothing like the flavorful dishes of years past.  I gave it two stars only because of the peanut sauce which was excellent.<//Text>< pics>

<text>used to love this place and came all the time. It's turned very commercial don't go here thinking you can modify anything to fit your needs. allergy or diet restrictions not welcome. Rude manager informed me that they can't add anything because everything's pre-packaged even if they have the ingredient in the kitchen. And don't get the spring rolls in there refrigerator they go bad fast. The good old days of quality food that was made to order here are long gone.</text>< pics>

I am no Thai food expert, but I am a big fan of Pad See Ew. First time I went here, thought it would be a lock for my favorite Thai place in town, but my Pad See Ew was a bit dry. Quality ingredients and tastes fine, just thought the sauce could have been a little more prominent. Will probably try other places before I circle back around to Saffron.</review>

The food is mostly delicious (depends on taste I guess) and fresh with good ingredients. This is Thai comfort food not too westernized. Daily specials change periodically to follow the seasons and fresh ingredients.
Their beef Panang is great and all the curries are to write home about.
Their home made ginger and lemongrass sodas are awesome and their deserts, simple but good. Sticky rice mango and sticky rice banana.<//text>

Our first time trying this place. I ordered  the Satay Chicken with grilled vegetables. The Chicken was dry and tasted reheated and vegetables soggy full of oil. My husband didn't like his Entree either and after the first bite we left and don't plan on ever coming back. It was a waste of money.</text>

Great restaurant for either walk in take out or sitting down. The staff seems to be a picture of friendly and stand-offish, which is the only reason I left one star off.
If one of my customers smile at me and give them a compliment, I don't roll my eyes at them and neither should that guy behind the counter. Rude</review>

The food is great but the portions are kind of small I spent about $12 ordered noodles with chicken and the veggies and left hungry.</review>

<time>1544027064834< /time><Text>Saffron was a legendary Thai place for a long time and was dependably great. It was sold a couple years ago. Now it is sadly Thai in name only, the management isn't from Thailand and the food quality has noticeably declined. Was a 10 out of 10 would go again, now is is a "will never go again" for me.< /Text>< gmapID>

I was very disappointed with service (very unorganized) and the food. I ordered Pad Thai and they brought something else, so the server was gonnna go ask kitchen staff what happened and inform us what was going on.
However, the server dropped my plate at the kitchen and started taking orders, drinking soda or water, and helping other customers. Where is my food???
A long story short, I was disappointed with the unprofessional and unorganized staff and then the food taste. It is like Fake Thai Fast food style... I tried this place twice and I will never ever go back there ever again.
They don’t have proper Thai food. It doesn’t taste like Thai food at all.<//review>

I love coming here when I'm looking for something healthy and filling. They use lots of local fresh produce. I love the brain good with sweet potato and kale. The noodles are always yummy but the sticky rice with mango is to die for!</Text>

I've dined at Saffron hundreds of times over the course of the last 17 years.  The restaurant is under new management, and although the decor has been upgraded, the food has dropped off considerably.  The ingredients are still fresh, but without the hovering presence of the former long-time owner/chef, Saffron has reverted to middle of the pack.< /Text>

Great flavor, but my order and 3 other tables near me were wrong and super deleted. I order a salad wich came no problem and in a timely fashion but my husband’s plate took 25 minutes and came all wrong we didn’t say nothing because like I said we had been already there waiting for 25 minutes and we were not the only table with issues, i guess they got extremely busy and overwhelmed!< /text>

I just learned that Saffron Thai became part of the Karina's restaurant group, but I'm happy to say the menu is still the same and tasty as before. The restaurant has a beautiful renovation and the small space next door is now a walk up Karina's seafood window. Saffron Thai is my go to for roasted whole chicken. Their sweet pepper sauce and Cambodian salad that comes in the combo is delicious! You cant go wrong with anything else on the menu either. Their noodles plates and soup dishes are always great too! I wish they open up a restaurant in the southern part of San Diego/ Chula Vista area. Perhaps next to the Karina's at the mall as well? 😉< /review>

Even though they changed owners, they kept the ingredients and menu the same......that is amazing.  Thai food can be pretty unhealthy at times but safron is a good alternative to the unhealthy Thai food.   They have many healthy options.<//Text>

<review>I ate here the other day for lunch when I was in the area for business. I had heard really good things about Saffron so maybe I just had my expectations real high, but I wasn't too impressed with my meal. I ordered the Drunken Noodles which didn't have much flavor and were just too spicy. I asked for medium spicy and what I got were a bunch of hot noodles I could barely taste besides the spicyness. Maybe I need to try something different so I guess I would come back and try it again but my first experience was not the best.</review><gmap_id>0x80deab2e6b0a2f2b:0x757d25321229314b<//gmap_id></record>

<review>*UPDATE* after posting my review and contacting the restaurant the night that it had happened, I NEVER received a response of any sort. Management obviously thinks this is fine so stay far far away luckily Postmates took it seriously and refunded my the $5 delivery fee. 🙄

Pretty nauseating experience. I ordered with Postmates on July 3rd. I had gotten through half of my stir-fry before I realize that there were several long black hairs in it. I've never had such a gross experience at a restaurant. I get that stuff happens but a clump of hair in my food is just disgusting .</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>This is my favorite Thai in San Diego. They have a giant menu with many traditional dishes as well as some things I have never seen elsewhere. The style and preparation feels healthier than many other Thai restaurants found in America. I can't speak to the authenticity as I have never been to Thailand, but the original owner made the new owners keep using her recipes as a stipulation of selling, which is pretty awesome.< /review>< rate>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Food is ok. Not really that good. I ordered the Tom Yam soup noodle with shrimp. The shrimp is small, the noodles are so little, the tom yam flavoring is paste left on top for you to stir. Looks so much more like a fast food chain more than a restaurant, and you can't feel either the sour or spicy taste of the tom yam. Really normal food for a premium pricing</Text>< pictures>

I'm a thai food lover, and I love that this place is just up the street from work. They have a great quick lunch time menu. They can turn around a soup or chicken dish in just a few minutes but that doesn't translate to a stale or less than flavorful taste. While parking can sometimes be tricky, even at lunch, I've never not found a parking spot if I just drive around the block and off of India Street. The people here are always friendly, the smells and food inviting. I never mind spending my lunch here. If you're in a hurry, they do have food to go, just remember to a lot a minute or two to find parking.</text>

Better now since it was sold recently. They converted the chicken rotisserie place next door into a ceviche takeout. Their chicken is still available and still just as good. They took away some of the daily specials which was too bad since I love their khao soi noodle dish very much.<//text>

Expectations high as service and food was always so good when Su-Mei was present... She always was... Brought my wife and parents in law from Brazil just waiting to show them the famous saffron chicken thighs... We ordered 4 orders of two thighs and were told we could not have them because they would have to cut up 4 chickens and would be left with 8 breasts... I was shocked.. It was not like they ran out of chicken, but the order taker and the manager refused to take my order... Just saying they would not...and that was that... Not even thinking about offering an alternative or discount... The manager just turned away and started filling up a fridge... So disappointed and embarrassed, not only for me, but for Su-Mei... I will try to contact her...< /Review>< Pics>

Counter help lady was rude and impossible to understand she was leaning on the cash register chewing gum !
Food is not as good as used to be and soup Bowl is about half the size it used to be , but the counter chicklet should not be allowed in the front of house .<//Text>

A friend suggested we might like the food here.Sadly he was wrong.I couldn't have the stir fry because that's only available on Saturdays.My wife wanted something else but that was a Wednesday option...and the confusing menu by the day goes on and on.In the end what we had to choose was bland and boring.Bye bye.< /text>
