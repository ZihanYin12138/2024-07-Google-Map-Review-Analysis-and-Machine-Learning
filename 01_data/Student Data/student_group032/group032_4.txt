Husband was treated respectfully. Staff super friendly! I Had to wait all day out in car waiting for his procedure to be performed due to Covid, but staff kindly allowed restroom use which was amazing since we live over an hour away. Received a handmade get well card from staff which was very unexpected and kind. Highly recommend this center.</Review>

I recently had hand surgery at Fresno Surgical Hospital and based on the experience I had, I felt it imperative to leave a review. I am extremely nervous when it comes to surgery and anesthesia, because I usually get very ill postoperatively.

The entire staff took great care of me and kept me pretty calm through the entire process. I'm very happy to report that I did not get sick postoperatively. From my surgeon to the anesthesiologist and nursing staff, I received excellent care. I only wish I could recall my surgical team's names, because they were exceptional. Postoperative staff were also fantastic! Truly the best surgical experience I've ever had. I also received a get well soon card in the mail with staff's handwritten notes. I most definitely would recommend anyone having surgery to have it at this hospital.

Thank you for the exceptional care Fresno Surgical!!</Text>

Great facility. I was very impressed with how kind everyone is- from checking in to nursing staff. My nurse Patty was very kind and took her time with me- I never felt rushed. Everyone that took care of me during my procedure was extremely kind and made me feel at ease. I had a great experience at this hospital. Thank you!</Text>

They really put me at ease for having such a major surgery. I wish I could remember everyone's names, but the one nurse named Lindsay really stood out. She and her crew were wonderful. Having any type of surgery is not fun, but Fresno Surgical Hospital made it much easier to handle. Thank you again ! ❤< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Pleasant security at entrance gives you a mask. Precheck in by phone the day before was helpful. Desk check in that day was prompt. The preop prep staff was very thorough. Everything is exceptionally well organized and timed out. My Doctor visited before and after the procedure. The Anesthesiologist also visited preop and asked pertinent questions. The surgical room staff was highly skilled and reassuring. Everything was performed with precision led by the Doctor. It was easily accessible to the disabled and extremely clean. The post procedure staff was attentive and the discharge process was smooth with instructions provided to your driver. Everyone was very nice, attentive to details and cleanliness. Follow up call to check on your well being.</text>< Pictures>

After cervical spine surgery my stay here was overnight and I had the best care ever.  The nurses quick response  made me feel very cared for. Thank you so much Leah,   Marilyn, Jessica, Felicia... and sorry didn't get the food servers name; but she took care of my visitors and family too. You are all so dedicated and caring and encouraging. I truly appreciate all of you and helping me get better ♥️
Also would like to add the staff downstairs prepping me for surgery ... all very courteous and efficient and reassuring! Thank you for getting me through this.</text>

I absolutely love this hospital! I had my surgery done here for my kidney stones, and everyone in the facility was super nice and amazing. I went home the same day I can in, and after that day, they called and checked up on me, they even gave me a get well card. That was so sweet of them to do. I appreciate that greatly! The Hospital was very clean and the atmosphere had great vibes. I enjoyed my experience here. I would highly recommended this Hospital to anyone. Thank you so so much Fresno Surgical Hospital for a great experience, my card, taking care of me and everything else!<//text>

I cannot thank the staff enough for all of the great care, attention to detail, and supportive nature in each individual that permeates this wonderful place!  This hospital is truly amazing!  The warmth and sense of humor at times were especially meaningful and assured me that I was in the exact right place for my knee replacement.

I visited Surgical Hospital Dec. 5th for an eye surgery by Dr. Mendoza. I had a previous "bad " experience at a different facility; so, was naturally nervous.

Wow! What a wonderful experience. Every person I encountered from the moment I walked in the door was amazing. Receptionist and nurses were so friendly and considerate. And, of course, I simply adore Dr. Mendoza. Wish I could remember the anesthesia Dr. He spoke to me before the surgery and he was amazed at what I had to endure at the other facility. He promised me I would be relaxed and pain free during surgery. What an angel he proved to be. I really have to find his name so I can thank him. Everyone so extremely professional and empathetic. Facility was super clean and procedures were right on schedule. Thank you to every single person I was blessed to meet yesterday. I will be sharing my story with everyone I meet. Thank you for taking such good care of me</review>

<text>I had shoulder surgery at Fresno Surgical Hospital and have no complaints. All the nurses and hospital staff were friendly and treated me like I was one of there friends. The surgeon did a great job and I had an email from him before I left with his doctors report and pictures of the surgery. A couple days later I received a phone call from the hospital checking on how I was doing. A few days later I received a personal get well card from all the hospital staff that I received treatment from. If I ever need another surgery I will definitely try and get it done there. I would also recommend any of my friends or family to go there as well.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My experience with Fresno Surgical Hospital was so, so, so great, so positive. My operation contacts were so kind, optimistic, honest.  The anesthesiologist was wonderfully attuned to my needs and questions (he even returned to explain why my cardiologist insisted on two, more expensive to me and my insurance, stress tests hoops I had to jump through due to an abnormal EKG (from a different hospital, BTW)  He went and found out why and came back to tell me why!!!  The Cardiologist-- unaffiliated with the Surgery Center or my doctor, Dr. Aryan-- didn't even bother to explain it to me, he was dismissive.  Dr. Aryan, his assistant Chris, P.A., and the best of all anesthesiologist were just perfect.
My recovery room nurse (Callie, I think) was such a perfect person who knew EXACTLY what I was going through with pain. She brought me to the other side.
Then the nurses, Marilyn, Nicole 1 and 2, the P.T. people, the aides were par excellence bar none. And THEN the kitchen staff were so knowledgeable and kind.  I feel so lucky!< /text>

I have never felt this safe and looked after in any hospital or medical facility
. My nurses explained every aspect of my stay with them . When I was in pre op it started with a very caring and friendly nurse. I can't stress enough how human contact can take away a great deal of fear and negative feelings with just a caring stroke across my shoulder and a friendly voice . The nurses on staff at my room where just as friendly and I felt like I was their most important patient here. They really did listen to me when I had a problem or concern. I just want to add the chef makes incredible cupcakes!!<//Review>

<Review>Went This Wednesday, December 19th, 2018 to go get my Cortisone Injections done in my lower back from Dr. Kasturi. I'm 20 years old and I have really bad anxiety when it comes to needles. So when I went that day I let the nurse(s) know about my anxiety. They were super nice and really helpful, I literally had like 3-4 women nurses help me get through the IV lol,  I really appreciated that a lot. The Hospital was very nice and clean. I would definitely recommend coming to this place because everyone here were super nice and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Very special thanks to the nurses who help me out that day. Anyways Happy Holidays, and Merry Christmas!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80945d5a3ecc6703:0x83ed95b4d490fe1e< /Gmap_id></record>

I had a bad experience with a nurse in Pre op trying to start my Iv.  I told them up front that I’m not a good stick and that I need some preparation before they just Jab it in.  This particular nurse laughed and said I’m good at what so do you’ll be fine.  I told her again this is not my first rodeo, my veins roll, my skin is tough and veins are hard to find.  Once again she laughed and basically told me I didn’t know what I was talking about.
I preceded to let her try! That was the roughest IV stick I’ve ever had!  Once she was in ,she begun moving the needle violently under my skin looking for the vein!  Finally after no luck she started to apply pressure with the needle under my skin. I told her enough and take it out!   She immediately grabbed my arm and applied the worst pressure I could stand!  I don’t want a bruise she said!
The second nurse tried a second time after preparing my arm, heat etc.  finally got it in and it immediately stopped thereafter.
They had to replace it in surgery by the dr.
Today two days later I have a 3x4 inch black bruise on my arm!  That is not exceptable!  I understand you are a professional but when you don’t listen to your patients concern to satisfy your own gratification that is not okay!!!!

Wish I could send the picture of the buirse on my arm!!!!< /text>

< Review>
Very limited on options with surgery for my 2 year old. Not helpful on future of my child teeth.  The surgeon had no advice nor info to offer after surgery.  Worst experience for my child. I regret coming here. What a shame.
Update: while waiting for surgical procedure in the lobby numerous of parents were frustrated about the wait time for their child to be seen.< /Review>

Rescheduled my 11 am appointment to 6 am...calling me the night before surgery!  This makes things extremely stressful when you don't have family in your area and friends are juggling their schedule for you. However, the worst was when one nurse after another (3 in total) tried and failed to get the IV needle right...they each poked me 2 or 3 times.  They finally had to ask the anesthesiologist to do it and he just crammed that huge needle up my hand without any Lidocaine...extremely painful.  I still have bruises up and down my arms from that day.< /text>

When I said something about it, they acted like I was the one in the wrong and just made excuses. Shame on them for allowing me to go through that experience. I didn't get to see her until after I demanded to find out what was going on with her.</Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Isa Deux< /user_name><Review>Excellent care in-hospital! Then, disappointment. Fresno Surgical Hospital (FSH) was the very FIRST establishment to give a "heads-up" to possible problems acquiring (needed!) opioid medications via old prescription paper/srandards. As forewarned, 1-hour post-op, pharmacy refused to fill prescription. Luckily--though it took 7-hours, two, consecutive, round-trips to Fresno from Oakhurst/Mariposa, and ridiculous pain--we were able to get meds from our primary care physician. It might have been reasonable to NOT let us leave BEFORE the issue was resolved...and there seemed something "off" about the post-op release...but we're resourceful, and got satisfaction using knowledge and tenacity. Recommedation One: Do not release ANY patient with an invite to "call us (FSH) if you have any (prescription) problems," if the invite is simply "out-the-door" rhetoric. If FSH post-op staff is aware of prescription problems, and one, informed lady obviously was, be straightforward with all information. Nobody should have to go through an hours-long ordeal to get pain meds immediately after surgery! 3-stars for not handling patient business throughly.</Review>< GmapID>

Even though it forced me to leave the house at 5:00AM that part went OK and we arrived on time. The receptionists in the Out Patient registration were very competent as well. Finally, my pre-op nurse comes out to take me back. She's OK as well. She makes me sign a bunch of forms, and then gives me my IV. Again, so far, so good. The surgeon arrives and stops for a moment  as he is headed to scrub in. He explains once again, and even marks the area on my wrist where he intends to
cut. Now, my nurse tells me that the anesthesiologist will be by shortly, he/she will give me my pre-op shot, and then it's off to surgery. I have had a treacheostomy since 2001, and been operated under general anesthetic before. Instead of being intubated, the doctor puts the oxygen directly onto my treach. My surgeon knew about this, and confirmed with anestheiologist on staff this would not be a problem. Well, guess what? You guessed it. As I said I was waiting for a Pre-op shot. But, instead another nurse walks in and tells me that I needed to go elsewhere for my procedure. The surgeons office told the hospital that I had a treach. But, that fell through the cracks, and despite my willingness to signing a waiver holding everyone, the surgeon, the hospital, no one would be held liable. But no dice. I was told that I would be receiving a very nice gift in the mail to compensate for the mix up.
I was rescheduled to have the work done at St. Agnes, and I almost had the same thing happen there. There reasonable minds followed through, and, I now have my arm in a sling, and will require at least one more operation. But at least I'm on the way. DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR FRESNO SURGICAL HOSPITAL UNLESS THE YOU SPEAK TO THE COMMITEE WHO APPROVES OR DENIES THE INCOMING OPERATION!!!!<//review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had this company wrap my van, they created a nice logo and wrapped it on my van. The van came out OK it does have to many bubbles on it that I have to pop. Than when I asked for a copy of the logo on a flash drive, they wanted $500.00 for it and that didn't include the flash drive. $1,600.00 for the wrap and $500.00 for logo. Pretty high for logo, I thought. The customer service over there needs a lot of work. The owners are not professional. They eat and snack while talking to clients. Their computers were down and would not return phone calls. Need to look for someone a littler more professional.<//Review>< name>

I like to cash my checks there. Fees are reasonable and staff is quick, knowledgeable and super friendly.  The market's prices are way too high for me, although, occasionally, I will buy their Los Altos brand queso fresco--I have a weakness for this delicious cheese.  Exquisite!</review>

< Review>
Been shopping here for 11 years now, & I understand it's a small business, but their prices are too expensive now. I love their place, but I love my money, & know I can get more for it. It's a shame.< /Review>

I ordered the Italian half Sandwich. Service was fast and the meal was very tasty. Good thing I ordered a half because I would have eaten a whole very easily. 🙂</Text>

<text>I'm gonna call it like it is. Capriottis is a subsidiary of Subway, so don't think it is some mom and pop shop, it IS a chain, and the franchisees have MANY VENTURES.
I WOULD have given a 5 star review, but alas, just yesterday I received the DRIEST, most OVERCOOKED cheese steak sandwich, the large, which is a $22 sandwich, all that with no bell peppers in it.
Granted, the BOBBIE is one of the most delicious sandwiches EVER, the cheese steak is USUALLY SUPER DUPER, but the meatball sandwich was mediocre at best.
Shame on Capriottis, I mean Subway, because a TWENTY DOLLAR SANDWICH should NEVER be dry or lacking. C'mon already. It's a SANDWICH.

Essentially, Capriottis is everything that subway isn't, deliciously soft and chewy bread, but really, who can eat bread these days anyway.
Capriottis is Subway but OPPOSITE, while the latter has Jared as a spokesperson touting a regemin of healthy lifestyle choices, Capriottis spokesperson would probably be more like The Godfather, totally unconcerned with fitness or diet, as the Bobbie stacks bread with more bread, deliciously sinful and forcing extra workout days in between.
Meh.
Hit or miss, which can be expensive or worth it.< /text>< response>

First time here. Got the meatball sandwich. Meat is slow cooked and the bread is soft and fresh made. Tastes delicious! I highly recommend this meat ball nom noms!< /review>

I've only tried the Classic Cheese Steak and their Capastrami. I really enjoyed the cheese steak with sweet peppers, very delicious. The Capastrami was good too but I didn't like it with the coleslaw and russian dressing. I guess I'm not used to eating it like that. Thier meets are always cooked to perfection, very flavorful and juicy. I downloaded their app which gives you points towards $10 gift. I will definitely be back 😁</text>

<Time>1618274282760< /Time><rating>1<//rating><review>Ordered online last week to beat the lunch rush hour. Confirmed my order and showed up 25 mins later to De Soto. Watched three walking. Cust get their orders first and thats after waiting 20 mins, asked what going on with my order, rep has my order on the counter but was told it never flowed to kitchen print out. Was told it be 15 mins asked for my money back my hour was pretty much done.  This was on a Friday, today Monday decided to walk it, place my order over $30 for 2 10 " subs, I don't mind paying for good food. Meat was dry and cheese was burnt! Not even upset, just disappointed at the service.

I don't share my info  publicly, but let me know where I can contact you. Thank you.</review>< Pics>

If you miss Thanksgiving food or just love a really a great sandwich this is where to go. I always get the bobby. It's fantastic. I'm not a sandwich person but this is the best sandwich I've ever purchased.<//review>

<review>This was the first time I have ever had one of their sandwiches. I had the pastrami. I had them hold the slaw as I'm not a fan of it either on or off of sandwiches. I still enjoyed their version. I plan to try other selections in the future. I ordered through their website and it was pretty easy even with the requested special preparation. The only thing that was a little confusing was at pickup. They have a group of cubbies to the right when in go in and the order counter to the left. If you've ordered and paid online, all you need to do is go to the cubbies and find the receipt with your first name and last initial and your order is there in the cubbie. Enjoy.......I know I did!< /review>< Pictures>

Excellent quality and service. We got the turkey sub, meatball sub and soups. The Tomato bisque soup was one of the most delicious I have had in a while. It was easy and safe to pick up the sandwiches during covid. The bag was in a cubbie so it was easy to just grab and go. Convenient and great quality food.</Review>

I usually get this when I am in Las Vegas however I was passing by the 1 location that is somewhat near me here in Chatsworth so I had to stop. Good Philly as usual. They need to get the Wise chips but because that completes the meal.</Text>

Great sandwich spot! Had a pretty good cheesesteak. Prices are slightly high but that's expected in this area. Much better than the Jersey Mike's nearby.<//review>

So today we decided to go in before the lunch rush and ordered at 11:50. Got our sandwiches at 12:26. They weren't even busy and it took 36 minutes to make a cold turkey sandwich. Hard to go to a place on a lunch break that has these long wait times. If they can get the wait down to 10 minutes or so I'd give it 5 stars..</review>< Response>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Great sandwich shop. Had the Classic Italian and it was delicious. My only co plaint is that there wasn't any crunch to give some texture. It was like biting through a pillow. Which isn't bad but even with the pickles and peppers there wasnt any. Ok one more complaint, the sandwich was wet with vinegar and oil. Which again is ok with me but if you don't eat eat within 5 minutes it will probably end up soggy.</text>< Pictures>

We've been waiting for this to open up for some time. We started with Las Vegas locations. So happy they open here in the valley. Service is fantastic, their bread is delightful, everything is fresh. The turkey is roasted fresh daily and hand-cut. Every Sandwich we've tasted is wonderful. Plenty of free parking and don't forget to join their loyalty program.< /text>

<Time>1569042817420</Time><rating>3< /rating><Text>Heard all good things about this place and was looking forward to trying it. Finally made it there after 8pm on a Friday night. Was surprised to see that they roasted their own Turkey and beef. I ordered Bobbi's Turkey sandwich (Turkey, cranberry & stuffing), it reminded me of Thanksgiving leftovers.   The flavors were good, but both the turkey & stuffing were dry. It might have been due to the late hour and the food was left over from earlier in the day, but I would hope that a sandwich at 8pm would be as good as a sandwich at noon. I'm willing to give it another try, maybe at lunchtime. They're not your typical sandwich shop; it's worth a try.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The sandwiches were great. I had the Grilled Chicken Parm and it was so good that I got the Homemade Meatball and took it home for dinner.

No 5 stars only because the ordering system is not intuitive for a first time guest. The Half sandwich is smaller than a Medium. It's like a weird snack size. Was definitely surprised. They did have kind of sample sizes at the POS, but it wasn't very clear.

Food is excellent though! Friendly, quick, and courteous service.< /review>

These are the best subs ever! I would even compare to Dave's subs or Cavarettas. Sooooo good. The prices are better than Jersey Mike's and with bigger portions! Great quality ingredients.  Staff is super friendly and even remembered me on my second visit. My favorite is the Bobby sub that's basically Thanksgiving dinner on a bun. Turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing. The perfect Balance of each ingredient Everytime.. the bread is soft and fresh and tastes like they just made it for you while you were waiting. They are very accommodating to special requests and act like they are happy to have you as a customer. Only complaint is it takes a while for you to get your sandwich because they get crowded. I suggest ordering in advance. 😁<//review>

Good combo deal, half sandwich philly cheesesteak and clam chowder soup for $9.99. A little bready and the meat could have been thinner, melt in the mouth, but the chew proved it was real meat. I would try it again for other menu choices.< /Review>

As far as I'm concerned, the Bobby sandwich is their best. The cheesesteak runs a very close second. Honorable mention goes to their non-meat chicken sand done like a cheesesteak variable.<//review>

The Bobbie sub is a must try sandwich at this place. Their sizing is a bit misleading. The sub below is medium and the one on top is large. Double the size.< /Review>

Sandwiches are very small, not filling, and aren’t anything special considering the price they charge for them. 17 dollars for a sandwich, chips, and a drink? No thanks, I’ll go elsewhere where I’ll be satisfied after eating my meal.</text>

I’ve been to many gyms, this is my favorite for many reasons. They really worked hard adapting to new covid regulations.
Personal trainers are $50 per hour, much less expensive than most other gyms.<//review>

<Text>… I’m going to go Ahead and have to give this place a 0.0 stars

Not only did they take over a year to get me a shirt that I ordered but the gym is way too expensive they also make you pay for an auxiliary gym because they can’t use the inside and the professionalism of the management is close to zero… There are about 15 other gyms in the area that are a third of the price I would look elsewhere first< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Last year, UFC HB messed up on my billing and overcharged me $25. Instead of refunding me in the original payment form, they told me they were going to give me $25 credit to use at the gym. Where is the credit now? I have no clue.... because they won't honor it.

2 weeks ago, I went online and saw that they were offering a $1 down, $29/month for one club access. I registered for a free trial the next day to see how it is after opening since COVID-19. I came in to sign up on Friday and Joe said that the price was a mistake and that I wasn't supposed to see that $29/month on the website.

Joe asked if me I was looking for a $29/month membership at UFC and I replied yes. Then he proceeded to let me know in a demeaning manner that "There is a Planet Fitness down the street for $20. That's something that you can do." If you've changed your prices, fine. But Joe did not have to be insulting and rude. I came to this gym because I thought it was nice with great vibes and people but Joe completely ruined that for me.

As a sales associate, he could have been more professional and not SPITEFUL in the way he spoke to me just because I came in asking about the one club membership that was ADVERTISED on the website.

Joe, a sales assistant manger here, decides to give me a call to ask if I wanted to come in and check out the gym. I nicely responded, "no thank you," only to get him to hang up on me without another word. On top of my previous experience here, I'm beginning to question the professionalism that this gym upholds. Highly NOT recommended unless you would like to be disrespected at this gym with rude and unprofessional sales rep.< /Text>< pictures>

The UFC gym in Huntington Beach is awesome. They have a huge facility with state of the art equipment. It never feels crowded even though there are a lot of people working out. They have great classes and the instructors are amazing. I highly recommend joining the UFC gym in HB if you are looking into joining a gym.<//text>

<userid>116884953206357086052<//userid><Text>Richie Munguia is one of the best trainers at this facility. He’s well trained and knowledgeable in his field. I entrust in him to provide the right training and best workout sessions to fulfill my personal goals. I have been 100% satisfied.

For the past three years I’ve known him he has shown the utmost professionalism and sincere concerns about helping you become a better you. He’s very good about walking around during class to ensure everyone is performing their moves correctly and motivate them to push their hardest without making them feel pressured. He also goes above and beyond by providing training and health tips to the members after class.

If you need help or looking to get a post-workout recovery session, I highly recommend Richie. He has helped me manage my lower back and knee concerns; aches, tightness and discomfort. He knows exactly where to hit the problem areas and each time I have felt improvement and feeling back to my normal self. Thanks Richie!

I’m giving the facility 4 stars, but Richie deserves 5 stars.< /Text><date>1553784352819< /date></record>

UFC gym in Huntington Beach is an incredible environment not only to work out in but to be in. The staff is all excellent and very fit themselves . The shakes and healthy food selection at the arm bar is top notch. All of The weights are quality and the upstairs area is the icing on the cake . They have a UFC octagon , Jacobs ladder , multiple different forms of cardio HIIT training and more. Best gym ever .</review>

The Quality of Trainers and Classes made the switch from my membership with 24hour well worth it!
The facility is tidy and well stocked.
I value the In-dressing room Sauna and towel service immensely!
I can’t say enough good things about the Instructors.
I haven’t met one I haven’t adored and appreciated, they’re all so different and special in their own way.
From Boxing to Yoga these trainers are ELITE!
The Vibe is a mix of both Community Spirit and Commitment to Craft.
If you’re even thinking  “Maybe I’d like to take my fitness to the next level..”,
there’s only one choice that makes sense, UFC all the way!</Text>

Nice gym but poor values to serve. Costly to come inside with extra fees. Fairly long process to cancel it. Vibe is weird and confusing. Best for me not to come again. Nice equipment though service needs to improve with better pricing. I got a friend who even stop going here due to high prices.< /text>

Love going to the gym now. So many choices for your workout. I have trained with coach Richie on and off since I have been a member. He is great motivator and works within your abilities but does push you beyond. He also helps you through your injuries, which I have had many. I have gained a lot of muscle and feel more confident in my workouts.</review>

<review>This is far the best Gym ever in OC!!!  everyone under the guidance of GM DJ, are loving life,  the members are all serious athletes and very professional, returning weights to racks, when finished returning everything to the proper places... it's such a pleasure to see the professionalism that the gym attracts
the coaches are friendly and willing to help.. you need to ask them, they don't get into anyones business unless asked
all in all, ratings 1-5 doesn't do this place justice.. i'll give it a 10</review>< pictures>

UFC Huntington Beach is always pleasant experience to workout at. The staff are very nice. They are always saying hi and smiling. All the instructors are so knowledgeable. They show you the techniques in details whether taking a Jiu-Jitsu class or boxing. My whole family works out here. I highly recommend this gym for everyone kids and adults.<//Review>

I went to the UFC Gym during the Christmas Holiday Season 2019 to purchase a two year family membership ( 5 people) for a Christmas gift.  However upon entering the gym I witnessed a sales team member, named "TK", treat two other visitors with such disrespect.  He was devoid of any professionalism, and actually was hostile and aggressive.   I was appalled at his behavior.  I have heard many incredible reports about the quality of this gym, but if TK reflects the caliber of the staff I am very disappointed.  I could not support such a center. I left purchased my gift membership for my entire family at Equinox of Huntington Beach.  First impressions go a long way and this season UFC lost my business due to their sales member "TK."  Please provide better training to your staff.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Although the idea if UFC Gym might be cheesy to some, if you don't get hung up on that and give this place a try, you will see that it is an awesome place.

I always wanted to try out some martial arts, but didn't make it a priority once I had kids. My neighbor told me about the old UFC Gym facility, and I was sold. So I signed up for the new gym- beautiful clean facility. Other benefits- you don't pay extra for child care, towel service, numerous group fitness and martial art classes. I could go on..

I am new to BJJ, but this has been a great place to get started. The coaches are top-notch and super cool guys all around. And their is a great family class that I have been able to attend with my daughter. Love the place and atmosphere so much that I signed up my son too.

Great place with great instructors where my kids can do some martial arts as a secondary sport at a very reasonable cost.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dd26f3f04ee97b:0xc936bb8085d292d<//GmapID></record>

Awesome Gym, friendly helpful staff, clean lively environment with a multitude of equipment and instructional classes to participate in and get your sweat on, decent music plays over the intercom speakers most of the time, disinfectant spray bottles and towels at nearly every corner for when you are done using the equipment, 2 floors where you can vary your workouts comfortably and a juice bar with a healthy modest meal selection, parking located on the 4th floor of the parking structure between the gym and the nutritional supplements store, gym is open 24/7 excluding holidays, holidays either closed or open only during the day, closes early.<//Text>

This new gym is awesome! There are a lot of equipments, great variety of classes, and awesome staff who are helpful! If you're looking for an intense, fun, and challenging workout that will help you shred off unwanted weight and push you closer to your goals, take the 7 PM kick boxing class on Mondays with Coach Kristi! :)<//review>

When it comes to the music, UFC Gym Radio is a podcast that has a mixture of genres - House, dub Step, rap, rock, and a little bit of pop.

If it is during any of the busy times of the gym, we keep the volume up to help support the classes.  However, I do see that you workout very early in the morning.  The reason that it is not able to be turned down is because only management has access to the music/sound/volume room, therefor the front desk associate would not be able to accommodate.  I will work on making sure that the volume is turned down during the slower hours of the gym, but we do encourage that people do not wear head phones; as it creates a better sense of community in the gym.\n\nWhen it comes to the normal weight lifting machines, I am sorry you feel that way.  We have several machine weights, yes they might not be considered normal, but they are the latest model of the machines.  We have 25 machines, 2 leg press (1 dual action), 6 squat racks, 4 Olympic lifting stations, 19 station cable machine, 2 smith machines (1 dual action), 6 flat benches, 9 hammer strength machines, and dumbbells ranging from 5 - 120 lbs (2 sets).  In addition to this, we have a Hex bar, 10 extra bars for dead lifts, and miscellaneous exercises, and plenty of other toys to play with upstairs.  Our focus here at the UFC gym is that everyone works with a coach either privately or in a class.  Therefore, if you see something missing or are not familiar with, we have plenty of people that help take your exercises to the next level.\n\nPutting weights back is something that we encourage our members to do in addition to the staff, as do all gyms.  We do have our special operations team there at night to help aid in the re-racking of weights but we are definitely not perfect and can improve upon that.  Unfortunately at 3:00am, you are correct that we do not have team cleans but during the hours of 7:00am - 10:00pm it is required that our coaches, operations, and membership team do a team clean.  In between the hours of 3:00am - 7:00am we do not have our special operations team on staff, as this is the slowest time of the gym.

Sweet new gym!! It's amazing and a ton of equipment. Love the old trainers, but excited for new classes and instructors as well! Perfect blend of standard gym offerings +MMA. Staff has always been super courteous and super accommodating since I joined in 2013.< /text>

Great gym lost of facilities and loved the classes, but poor care for their costumers and gym goers. I talked to someone over the phone and asked if they could freeze my account this was late 2018, I was assured that he would. I was getting sick and had to go back to my parents in Washington for awhile since I had difficulty up keeping my quality of life here while ill for three months. When I came back I had a bill for almost 300 dollars for late fees and was being threatened that they would take further action. I emailed them back but no real response and I had no proof of asking for the freeze on my account. So I payed to avoid any trouble but still no one cared. Not coming back stop sending me emails.

If you need to freeze you account please record the call or go in don't let them forget and don't let them bully you.< /review>< pics>

This gym is massive. All the equipment is brand new and up to date. I take ju-jitsu classes here and the instructors are fantastic. They are knowegeable and fun. They also have a cafe there and the protein shakes are fantastic. The cost of membership is really good for the services you get. Don't park in the lot right in front of the gym, or you might get towed. I love this place it's my home away from home.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>This is not just a gym it's the ultimate in fitness. You get everything from the standard free weights,  treadmills,  machines and everyday run of the mill classes like yoga,  Pilates and Zumba. However,  UFC Gym also gives you Brazilian Jujitsu, Boxing,  Kick boxing,  Must Thai,  Cross Fit and so much more all inclusive! I did 5 weeks for personnel training and it was a great start to my fitness program.
I will say the initial price is high if you do the Ultimate package and if you consider it just a "gym," but that's the wrong way to look at it. It's not just a gym its every combat sport all in one place and all for one low monthly price.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Took my 8 years old to check out their boxing class for youth.
1)Deafening adult music turned on full blast (when we walked outside took us some time to get back our hearing)
2) Too many kids
3) Guy covered with gangsta tattoos from top to the bottom (supposed to be my kid's couch ) walking in circles doing nothing. Kids on their own - not getting any personal attention - just trying to imitate somebody in a far end of a large room showing something...
Never in my life seen such a mess (sorry never been in prison).
Don't recommend for children and people who don't have ear plugs on them.< /text>

{'time': 1503025212677, 'text': 'Hello Vitaly,\n\nThank you for taking the time to write this review.  We do apologize that you did not have the greatest experience with us.  The things that we can address are the music and the number of kids in our program.  When it comes to the gym, we do like to push it/be a little edgy when it comes to the volume.  We encourage everyone to not wear headphones; it creates a sense of community.  As for the amount of kids, we do have anywhere from 2 to 5 coaches in class.  The structure of the program is all dependent upon the style of class and one on one attention is also dependent upon the amount of student to coach ratio.\n\nAs for the tattoo remark and prison comparison, that is very subjective and unfortunately insulting to the coach as a person.  Having tattoos does not mean they were/are a gangster nor is this place comparable to a prison.  Matter of fact, the youth coach who taught the class is a wonderful father of 2 beautiful girls.\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking the time to write this review and we hope you have a wonderful day.'}</Resp>

Cancelling membership is a hassle. They somehow lost my cancelling contract and charged me an extra month, and my refund was not gonna process until I had to contact them again. Make sure u have your contract or take a pic of it for your records. Maybe it's just this particular gym, who knows.<//Text>

This is the best, and only place I go for juice and mods. Kelly and his crew take good care of me. I have tried a few of the other places in town, and you just can't beat the person to person interaction you get at VapeArttic.<//text>

Love this place! The owner and all the workers are very helpful and make you feel like family! If you need something not in stock the owner goes out of his way to get it ordered and picked up in a very quick time. They have a huge variety of juices and are very accommodating! We will only shop here for all our vaping needs! You guys rock!</Review>

<text>This place has never failed me. From the wide selections to the care and support from the employees and fellow customers. They are very customer orientated and care for the community they build. I'd recommend Vape Attic for anyone searching for quality products, and customer care. Don't be overwhelmed from the large selections, they will narrow it down to fit your specific needs and ensure that you are comfortable and satisfied.</text>< pics>

Some of the best in the biz. Never found an IE shop with as many flavor choices as these guys. I always feel welcomed and its always nice hanging out with the staff and customers. I highly recommend this store. Anyone who lives out east on the 10fwy can easily stop in on their way out west.< /Text>

The best vape shop I've ever been to! They have a great selection and low prices for new top products. Kelly is the best! He goes above and beyond for you and is very knowledgeable and skilled. I trust him with my devices above anyone else. If you vape, this is definitely where you need to go!<//review>

I like vape attic! Sometimes when I go in there though, I have a hard time deciding which juice I want to buy so I think the employees get irritated when I ask to sample different flavors and for that I truly am sorry!!  But I really like the vibe and the TV! Very chill!< /Text>

I switched from smoking to vaping a week ago. I wanted to switch but I didn't know enough about vaping or what I would need. If you are unsure and have questions stop in and see Maggie, she answered all the questions I had and gave me more information I didn't know about. Maggie is great and very helpful and patient and will get you what you need with no BS. It has been a week of vaping and I have not craved a cigarette. Thank you Maggie.</text>

Thanks to the great people at Vape Attic for helping the new guy get on the right track and providing good advice!

i went in expecting them to kinda shun the new guy to the vaping scene, that was the biggest mistake on my part. i explained i wanted to kick the ciggs to the gutter, and asked for their help and advice, and they were more than helpful and wanted to help me kick the cig habbit and knew exactly what i needed and how to accomplish that with the device i own and was using and how it should be set up, and what is recommended. THEY CARE!

These people are down to earth, energetic and passionate about their business & more importantly, their customer care.

Very welcoming, friendly, and have a very wide range of everything you could want or need, and at GREAT PRICES.

10/10, I'd recommend you all check them out!</Text>

<Text>The service was very good. However, I ordered the shrimp tacos and the lobster tacos. My 1st 2 bites of each was not what i expected. It was the taste of mostly dry veggies and then dry shrimp or lobster. Once we used the salsa that came with the chips and ordered more of the white sauce that was barely on each tacos ...then the taste was better. However ...on my next visit I will try something else. On my 1st visit there, about 3wks prior, i had the salmon & veggies ...it was very good. ☺<//Text>< Pictures>

Food was good but I was over dressed. The pictures on yelp seemed like a hipster party restaurant. Definitely not the location in Long Beach.</text>

To be honest, the dishes here are kind of a hit or a miss. But when they’re a hit, they’re a HIT! My hit are the fried fish tacos that are soo good. I also enjoyed the watermelon margarita special, although it was a little too salty for me.

Above all, their chips are absolutely delicious. They have a spice on top that makes them addictive. Pair them with the guac and you’ll fall in love! 😍

Also, the views at this spot can’t be beat!< /Review>

It was for my son's 8th wedding anniversary and l did tell the young lady that took my reservations but nothing special was done.  Tacos beef overdone and dry.  Salmon excellent.   Husband's dish fine.  Son's rib eye fajitas overdone.  Salsa tasteless but chips great.  Slow service.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<text>Nice atmosphere and great service, but not much other than that. The tortilla chips are very good, but everything else is bleh. It's like Mexican food, but with white people spice and flavor level. Not worth the prices imo.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Ola has incredible Mexican food, tasty drinks and is in a great location over looking the Long Beach harbor.

I ordered the lobster tacos which were amazing, a margarita, guac & the street corn. It was quite pricey so I have yet to go back, but if it were a bit more reasonable you bet I would be back way more frequently. The service is fine, nothing special but not bad either.

Definitely make a reservation or you will have to wait awhile for a table. I haven't been since before covid times so I am not sure how they are adhering to CDC recommendations (masks, social distancing, etc).

Great spot for a special event! Enjoy :)<//Review>

Flavorless. Nice place, good service but bland. We ordered cheese enchiladas, they tasted like tortillas soaked in tomato water. Guacamole tasted like nada. You’re better off eating paper.</Text>

Visually everything looked good. Taste was very bland. Also the customer service wasn't even average. I have thoughts on why but that might be the norm.</Review>

First time at Ola's today for lunch. The grilled fish tacos were very good, but the prize went to their rice and black beans! Best I've had in a long time! Wonderful view of the marina and clearly complying with the social distancing rules.  Wonderful lunch!</review>

Really good food! A little pricy, but you get a lot of food and good food for the price. The location is amazing on the second floor overlooking LB harbor. Definitely coming back here.<//Text>

My meat was dry and the pay area is confusing. We thought the order area was the pay station. The churro was nothing but oily and cold. Meat had a bunch of fat and was chewy. We often give a lot of stars to places but this place was off in taste etc and we drove far to get here. Agua fresca was good but won't be coming back here< /Review>

Of all the restaurants I have witnessed that are open during this year's pandemic, this one seems to have the best atmosphere aesthetically and for social distancing. The food is delicious as well.< /text>

Excellent dinner on a chilly Sunday night. The cocktails were delicious, especially the Abreojos, with cucumber and jalapeño. The langostino ceviche was fantastic. Short rib and lobster tacos and siete mares were rich and tasty.</Text>

One of the best Mexican restaurants that I have tried here in southern California I had the lobster tacos and the fish tacos and were amazing. my wife had the chile rellenos and they were amazing as well the type of cheese they use is out of this world. my daughter's had carne asada tacos and the meat is so juicy nothing like any other type of restaurant the guacamole was fresh the chips were fresh highly recommended. Can't wait to come back and try their other dishes.</text>

This was our first visit for their opening after the pandemic closed all businesses. The staff was friendly and the dining area is set up for physical distancing. They even offer a touch free menu option. I had the carnitas plate and it was delicious with great flavor!<//Text>

Absolutely! The best Chile Riano‘s I have ever had my husband ordered the ribeye fajitas and they were amazing. Hands down a great place to enjoy some awesome beach weather and dinner. Great,  atmosphere also. We definitely will be returning. I live about 2.5 hours away north, Definitely worth a day drive.< /Text>

Busy. Tacos, carnitas and pork belly were both good. Didn't care much for the salsas, green and habanero.  Enjoyed the watermelon and jalapeno margarita.< /Review>

<Text>Cute restaurant with great decor and location.  Staff is very friendly.  Food unfortunately was not good at all.  Salmon was fishy, skinny margarita had sour mix, etc......

Wow a nice little surprise this place was. I've never heard of it before nor eaten there (obviously) but the food is delicious. A wide variety of tacos and they range from fish to shrimp and even pork belly. Yea, that pork belly was mmm mmm good! Service is outstanding and friendly. The view is awesome especially if you're sitting outside which we were and even on a cool night the heat lamps are perfectly placed and it was very comfortable. Definitely going back to this place and trying other items on the menu.
P.s. very fresh and full of flavors. Their cocktails are excellent as well.< /text>

For a relatively new restaurant, they seem to have all there kinks worked out. The service was quick and the food delicious. My husband had the ribeye fajitas and I had the lobster and shrimp enchiladas. Both were good but the ribeye fajitas were amazing. The fat was carmelized to perfection. The only thing is I wish they had a machine that makes cappuccinos and lattes.<//Text>< pics>

A little pricey. Bought the 3 tacos, pork belly, salmon and the monthly special which was rib eye. The pork belly and the rib eye were awsome but the salmon tasted fishy like it wasn't fresh. Won't get the salmon again.</Text>

<Text>If you are coming here for, “Some of the best views on the California coast,” as advertised on Ola’s website, and expect to see waves breaking on a rocky shore or sandy beach (or for that matter anything that isn’t man made), you are going to be disappointed.  This restaurant, located on the 2nd floor of a shopping mall, is more than a mile inland from anything like that.  The balcony overlooks a utilitarian, nothing-to-see-here street which borders a large parking lot.  At the far edge of the parking lot, about two football fields distant, you can see the Alamitos Bay Marina and a shipyard.

You are also going to be disappointed if you come expecting to experience, “an exciting and tasty new first-to-market culinary concept” (another quote from their website).  I experienced nothing, nor did I see anything on the menu, to back up that claim.  I really have no idea what they’re talking about.

I’m not saying, “Don’t bother coming here.”  The service was good; the food was alright; the view is okay; and the prices are high enough to keep the riff-raff at bay, but not terribly out of line with the over-all experience.  If your in-laws are visiting from out of state and you’re looking to take them to a restaurant with a safe and sane, down-to-business, corporate vibe, but Olive Garden or El Torito seem a little too mundane, Ola might be the perfect choice.< /Text>< resp>

Waited 30 mns for a table,  sat us in the sun, ordered a drink, and asked the if we could moved to 3 open tables w shade. Hostess would not accommodate us, became argumentative when questioned why. Manager came over and defended his employees actions.
We asked for check , never to return again.< /review>

Unfortunately we don’t have enough shade for all the tables. Since you gave us a 1 Star at both our Huntington Beach and Long Beach location, I’m not sure where you actually dined today. I will discuss your review with our staff but I promise you once the Governor allows us to reopen you may sit inside in the shade. Until then, perhaps a hat or a parasol...?'}</resp>

Decided to stop by here today and the employee stated they will not be opening today at 12, instead they’ve decided to change the time to 1 or maybe 2. This has happened multiple times on a Sunday now. So unprofessional.<//Review>

Clothing for me is a hit or miss, it really depends on you individual style preference.

< Review>
I am so extremely disappointed and quite honestly don't ever want to go in again! I came in for a few items and remembered that I had received a $100 gift card from my daughters friends mom, I was the carpool mom. Long story short, the cashier scratched off the numbers off the back of the gift card herself, and shortly after told me that the card is empty! She went on to tell me that her register has been acting up so she had her manager try to pull it up on the other register. They took my phone number and email and said they would get back to me after  running it by with corporate. It's been a good month and still nothing! Somebody that spent $100 dollars literally just gave it to them! I learned that you should NOT purchase gift cards from this store, because they will just say "oh well". Bad look.<//Review>

Very beautiful clothes! Perfectly! But the store is very dirty, there is a lot of dust on the floor. And a many things on which lies a layer of dust! This is very unpleasant.</Text>

< Review>
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. I'll admit two things: it's expensive and there are occasional seasons when the styles aren't attractive or comfortable.  However, this is rare. I consider some of my Anthroplogie clothing to be works of art, and the quality of the material and stitching is always top notch. I wish it would come to Folsom</Review>

Yes, their inventory is on the expensive side, but you just have to be patient and wait for some special sales. I bought some prettiest dresses for my daughters here.

We got the meat lovers and the pulled pork and braised short ribs were both very tender easy to pull apart with a fork. I have no idea what the loaded fries were loaded with but they too we're phenomenal. The brussel sprouts were another absolute hit.

Great concept and delicious Mac and cheese. I tried the shells with broccoli, bacon and mushrooms all topped with hot cheetos..which was a fun experience. If I had to do it again I'd pick a different crunchy topping or have them add less, because the cheetos overwhelmed the other flavors. Also, a highlight was getting the Mexican Coca-Cola in the bottle...delicious. I built my own but could see trying one of the pasta mixes on the menu as well. These would be good if you don't want to make decisions and just want a pre-set mix. Great outdoor seating area and good location at sunset considering how chilly S.F. can get.

Be aware that this Russian Hill area has lots of restaurants and parking can be difficult. All in all and fun place to eat at, and area to be in.< /Review>

This place reminds me of Homeroom in Oaktown, although the menu here isn't as robust.
We were definitely craving something hearty and decided on Mac'D based on the reviews and pics! SIP protocols...so had to order food to go...ended up enjoying lunch...errr....brunch at the park!

~ The BBC - 4/5
- Bacon ✔️
- Buffalo Chicken ✔️
- Hot Cheetos ✔️
Yes Please! Whats not to like?! maybe even...love! Hearty portions! The dish mush have weighed in like a light heavyweight UFC talent...hopefully not an exaggeration! We couldn't finish it! which is totally fine...brilliant set of leftovers!. Oooey gooey cheesy creamy richness...with a bit of heat from the Hot Cheetos...not to mention the crunchiness.

No complaints! I have no issues trying other things on the menu.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Food was good. Def going to go back and take the kids. Upset that they didn't have a working bathroom at 12am for customers  during covid! Its currently take out only. Great late date night dinner.  Build your own mac n cheese.  My bf ordered everything but pork, it looked unadvertising but it was pretty good. I had a simple mac n cheese with shrimp, Tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken.</text>< pictures>

San Franciscans’, though I am not a native of your city, I do have respect for a great number of the eateries this city has to offer.  With the continuation of COVID-19 restrictions, I have been searching for good food, fair prices, delivery “on-time”, etc., and discovered I was only able to get one of the 3 or a combination thereof.   Today, I found MAC’D, delivered by Cavier (DoorDash).

‘Michelin’ rated they are not – but they should be and I don’t mean a one-star rating!  (Note: San Francisco is home to about 36 Michelin Star Restaurants, most one-star rated).  I lived in SOMA and the restaurant I ordered from was located at 2127 Polk St (about a 10-minute drive from me.  I ordered the Hellapeno (w/ jalapenos, roasted mushrooms and chicken) and Mac’d Wings (BBQ and Buffalo).  Under special instructions, I noted that I was a fan of heat and to turn it up!  They did not disappoint!  The pasta was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  It was rich and creamy – smooth.  The additions set it off!  The meal was properly packaged to hold the heat.  I shared this with a friend and really understanding what a mistake I made.  The wings, as far as I’m concerned, were by far better that any wing I’ve ever had and yes, they did turn up the heat!  And I’m referring to Wing Stop and Buffalo Wild Wings!

It took approximately 35 minutes from the time I placed my order until it actually arrived.  I’m not sure what my expectations were BUT this I do know …. My food arrived HOT.  Not warm.  HOT!  That in itself was worth the price of admission.  The flavors and textures took me back to a period in time were pride was taken in the kitchens of restaurants as they compete for customers in the city that is known for loyalty to the only the absolute BEST.  I was shocked and amazed at the same time and to think that I had all be given up on being completely satisfied conducting a transaction.  Thank you, Mac’d.

This was a great experience.  The quality of the food, the portions, their packaging and the price.  I got a damn good meal at a fair price; delivered safely and done so with pride.  If this is the service I can expect every time I place an order – trust and believe I will be ordering at least 5 days a week.

To the kitchen staff I have this to say:  YOU GUYS ROCK!  I have not had food this well prepared and packaged for delivery in more than 2 years!  Thank you for a job well done!  To the owners:  You have some  amazing recipes.  If you ever become a rated restaurant I fear that it may push your operations beyond anything you can imagine.  I am a person big on “service” and “satisfaction” both of which your place not only met but exceeded my expectations.  Again, thank you.< /review>

<Review>Mac 'n cheese, yes please! A specialist place for the staple Mac 'n cheese is a delight. The variety of sauces and pasta had me very excited too. I ordered for a pesto sauce mix that turned out great. My side of Jalepeno poppers was nice too. The place is very clean and efficient. I would love to visit it again for a trip down childhood memory lane.</Review>< Resp>

Unfortunately I was denied service when I went to pay cash which is illegal in the city of San Francisco   In fact two weeks ago SFPD held a press conference stating this fact noting that the law is not rescinded and remains in effect. It will stand for reasons of equity. Violators will be fined.< /Text>

Quick service, huge portions, and delicious customizable Mac n cheese!  You can choose your pasta shape, sauce (I got pesto), mix-ins, and toppings. I’d definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for comfort food & you’re in the area!< /Text>

Best place for late night Mac. Hands down. The custom the option is there for those who want to be picky. Would NOT recommend you get all the meats. Don't you dare do it!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This is a hole in the wall place that can easily be passed up but it honestly is amazing! Lots of different types of cheeses and meats and veggies and sauces that you can add to your mac n cheese. But you can also order a specialty plate that has stuff on it. I got the BBC (Buffalo cheese sauce with bacon and hot cheetos) and my friend got the garden salad(creamy cheese with broccoli and peas). Both were absolutely amazing. And we also got these mac balls, they're a but pricey at $1 per ball but they were AMAZING. Really crispy/crunchy on the outside but beautifully cheesy on the inside and flavorful! Definitely recommend this place to everybody!< /text>< pictures>

Macaroni and cheese is such a simple meal, but Mac'D elevates it by providing multiple choices and cheeses to enhance your experience. Each of us got a different meal, and each came away overjoyed. The kids said that the wings were cooked perfectly, and the French fries were hot and seasoned perfectly, but the real star was the mac and cheese. I got the Hellapeno sauce, which provided a slight kick of heat, which went perfectly with the beef chorizo that is chose as my topper. See, the majority of add-ons are free, and you can get anything from mushrooms to Flaming hot Cheetos on your meal.

You can't go wrong here, and you gotta try it at least once.</text>

<Review>MAC’D was overall good. I wish they had more than one vegan cheese option, it’s a smoked gouda which is not really something I like but it wasn’t bad. I think if you like smoked Gouda, it’d be really good. I got the elbow noodles, broccoli and peas added in, and truffle oil and breadcrumbs on top. I thought it was really good despite me not liking the cheese although I couldn’t taste the truffle oil much, I think the taste of smoked Gouda overwhelmed it. It can also get really hot inside their building, next time I’ll go when the weather is cooler.<//Review>< pics>

<review>One of our favorite spots!! Absolutely delicious,  you get to create your own mac and cheese.  We're just recently used cauliflower instead of elbow noodles and it was absolutely delicious and obviously a much more healthier alternative to the actual noodles! The sriracha brussel sprouts are a must have!!!! My son is a picky eater and even he loves them!!!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJJfywrC9tzNvkPlC9CrDo_lLKLVNmqD3BTH_k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYslYJW6SdrrwBi2KclKp0XzMbmemPZcAsLxSh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw0FOlLPLA3bpCwIOhf-g69MqTJ4xiFQcESbtD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8085818422092b17:0x712683a02ff021b6<//Gmap_id></record>

Their online ordering on their website has no option to order pickup from their Portland location, even if you click their Portland location button. No mention of what location your ordering from when you checkout. No phone number for the San Francisco location, and no one answers the phone at the Portland location. So I can’t call to cancel my online order at the SF location and I’m in Portland. So stupid!< /review>

Delicious food, friendly servers.  Nice warm, cheesy snack on a cold rainy day. We had the traditional mac and cheese with peas which was good. The pesto with veges was a nice dish too!</review>

Placed an order for pickup during shelter in place. They were following no social distancing guidelines inside, with 8 patrons in a 5 x 10 foot area all ordering or waiting for food. My food was 30 minutes late being ready (and this was all before 6, so they shouldn’t have had a huge backlog of orders placed before 5). And to top it off, they gave me the wrong sauce with my Brussels sprouts, and the Mac isn’t even that good. Won’t be going back.< /Text>

< Review>
Literally the best mac cheese. People complaining are likely bots paid to push the company's ratings down. I cant see anyone complaining about it being bland unless you're a cheese expert that wants 100 different cheeses ina mac n cheese. This and Mac Daddy are king, with Mac'd being the better of the two for me.<//Review>

Price is around 12-15 for a bowl.

It’s good Mac and cheese and highly customizable. Very creamy and cheesy. Wouldn’t call it the best Mac and cheese I’ve ever had but better than most places.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Mac’d was good but nothing special. It’s nice that you can create your own but otherwise, there are better Mac and cheese restaurants in the city. The service was good and the staff were friendly. It was fun to try and a short wait. The sauce was watery though and the quality of the ingredients could have been fresher.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Awesome flavor and service.  The Mac and cheese is great and the options are endless but the brussel sprouts are a must have. The best fried sprouts I’ve had. Wish I wasn’t from out of town and could return regularly.< /Text>

Directed here by a helpful Escape Room operator. They have some fantastic combinations of M&C, best of all, you can build your own. We got two - buffalo sauce with chicken and truffle oil and hellapeno sauce, veggies and parmesan. Both were excellent, as spicy as expected and satisfying! Glad I don't live in SFO, or I'd be twice my size eating this every day! But a total must-visit!< /Text>

This place is hella good! If you like mac and cheese you'll love this place. If you don't like mac and cheese, you'll love it after this place. I prefer the buffalo mac and cheese. Mouth watering just thinking of it.</review>

I wouldn't have been upset if it were half the price, but it just wasn't good either way. I don't understand why it's more expensive than the other options when it's completely flavorless. It just felt like I was eating noodles in a flavorless sauce, I've had way better vegan mac and cheese.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

<text>I came here with my friend and we definitely enjoyed the place. I am a huge fan of trying different flavors and tastes of Mac and cheese and Mac'D stepped up to the plate. We tried there mac and cheese balls and it tastes way better than the dry and soggy balls from CheeseCakeFactory. You have an option to create and build your own mac and cheese plate from scratch. You wont be dissapointed come and give this place a try!

<text>felt a lot overpriced for something we could make at home ourselves. It’s hard to say, but when the garlic parmesan fires were better than the Mac — that’s a tough sell.

Honestly, I was a bit disappointed. I got the Meat Lovers and while the meat was ok, the Mac and Cheese was pretty bland.  The baked cheese top was probably the only redeeming part but overall it just felt like a needlessly heavy meal lacking flavor.< /text>

DELICIOUS! I got the Goddess (3 cheeses) with truffle oil topping (why has no one thought of TRUFFLE OIL on MAC N CHEESE BEFORE?)
+ Huge portions: you can definitely share one order with a friend, but why share if you could have the whole thing for yourself?
+ Seating: Table and booth options
+ Jalapenos added a fun kick, and chicken was SO tender
+ Loved this comfort food for a twist :') A fun and amazingly-priced alternative to SF brunches, so be sure to check it out!<//Text>

This place is legit. Big portions and gluten free/vegan options. Good vibes and yummy sauces. Vegetables if you like those like I do.</review>

This is the same MAC'D from that video you saw online! If you are in the Bay area, you absolutely MUST come in and eat! Especially if you're reading this review, right now.

What do I order you ask?
Goddess sauce, with all the vegetables, and hot Cheetos on top. Seriously.<//text>

Solid amount of options, place was bustling but not crowded, service was efficient and friendly. I opted for the build your own with basic sauce &shells, bacon & jalapeño add ins, and parmesan & panko topping. Came out piping hot and delicious!<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>First off I thought the directions were wrong to the mac'd I'm used to but nooooo I guess the mac'd on Fillmore is closed.  :(. We finally get inside and when my husband asked to use the restroom he was told by the guy at the cash register  " dont take to long "  (my husband is in a wheelchair) I went ahead and order our food. Me and my husband both got chicken,ham added to the goddess sauce. My son regular mac and cheese. My son is fine but me and my husband got sick.  I'm really paying for it and still don't feel good.  🤦🏾‍♀️< /review>< pics>

Traveling for work and saw this online so ordered delivery. They charged me extra for a bottle of soda but instead gave me a can. They also didn't bother to include utensils. The Mac and Cheese was also flavorless (I ordered the jalapeño one). Overall poor experience.</review>

<Text>So let's start with the place itself - so tiny that people have to wait for someone to leave to be able to sit down - reminded me of people fighting over a parking spot just standing next to it.
The staff - a little rude, but ok.
The food - the most important part and it was horrible. At this make your own mac n cheese place the best food was the brussell sprouts.
THE MAC N' CHEESE IS SO DRY. There was no flavor to the mac n' cheese and it reminded me of hospital food. I kept looking for water to wash down the dryness, but they have the water in a water jug on the front counter where everyone is waiting in line so you cant get to it. Every time I went up to get water, the jug was already empty anyway - probably a result of everyone trying to wash down the dry mac n' cheese.
Please do yourself a favor and save your money - dont go to this place.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Been meaning to visit Mac'd for quite some time and was a bit disappointed.

Pros:
•Pasta was cooked very well
•Plate came out bubbling hot and fresh and had a nice appearance just like the pictures
•Staff was kind and patient
•They had beer lol
•Plenty of topping and cheese options and is vegan friendly

Cons:
• #Basic cheese sauce tasted like Velveeta. Deal breaker for me since the cheese quality is what makes a good mac and cheese
• Hot Cheeto topping was just the bottom of the bag Cheeto dust, not crushed hot Cheetos.< /review>

I've ordered from this place twice, once on doordash and once on GrubHub. In both instances they sent me the wrong meal, one that was covered in meat when I am vegetarian so I cannot eat it. Very disappointing. I had high hopes for this place< /Text>

<Review>Delicious mac n cheese freshly made per order. You can DIY with base price $11 and add what you want. Extra for protein. Best to come earlier before dinner time if you can as wait time is about 8-10 minutes or longer. I went with DIY got pulled pork and crab meat both protein taste fresh with smell of seafood lingering upon receiving. Cheese melted with good consistency not watery and runny. It coated macaroni with thick coating without settling on bottom of dish. Be careful not to grab porcelain dish tab on side as it'll burn your fingers.<//Review><user_id>111450706673730952587< /user_id>< Name>

Far too pricey for their gimmicky dishes, found random ingredients from other dishes in my dish telling me they have problems with their prep process. It wasn’t restaurant quality mac-n-cheese, but then again it ~is~ Mac and cheese.<//text>

As a professional in the dental field, for almost 17 years, I can say Dr. Hansen and his team are amazing! I have had dental anxiety since I was a child. I completed treatment in his office today and didn't feel a single injection. I actually fell asleep in the chair! I still can't believe it.
I highly recommend this office not only for his gentle way with patients but his amazing dental work.
Thank you for making me feel so comfortable. You have a patient for life!<//review>

Always top notch and it really feels like the staff enjoy coming to work. Never trying to up-sell you but there for what you need. Excellent crown and restoration work.

As always Dr. Hansen and his caring staff make me feel very welcomed. I drive 4 hours round trip to see this dentist.The dental work that I have had done is extensive and Dr. Hansen made it painless and well worth it. I have a beautiful smile now due to this dentist and his expertise in cosmetic dentistry.</text>

The clinic itself has confidence and peace of mind.  Dr. John looked at my son, took a x-ray of him and gave us treatment recommendations.  Very attentive, careful, friendly person.  It can be seen that he wants to help, and not take more money from you.  Since I have been to many Sacramento clinics, I can say for sure that this clinic is now my favorite.  Best place in Sacramento for dental treatment.</review>< time>

Going to the dentist can be a traumatic experience for some, but maybe it is the dentist, not the procedure. This is true for me. Dr. Hansen’s  care, professionalism and precise clinical expertise is top-notch.  Perhaps this is why other dentists in the community choose him as their dentist. From his caring staff to his state-of-art equipment, this office has the magic tough. I put my family’s trust in his hands - perhaps you will too. Thank you Dr Hansen!</Text>

Probably the best dentist anywhere. I've had so many issues and have been to several other dentist Dr. Hansen is the only one who I have never had any issues. With crowns coming loose to bacteria building under fillings among other issues with other dentist Dr. Hansen's work has been exceptional never has to return to correct any work I'd definitely recommend him and his staff over anyone<//Review>

I really can't say enough great things about this office and the super nice, helpful people that make up the staff. I think I first started seeing Dr. Hansen in about 2005, he's been my doctor ever since. His work is exceptional, the hygienists are all very gentle and reassuring. I'm somewhat of a troublesome, super-sensitive patient, but they never make me feel that way. The office personnel is kind and happy, communication is excellent and I truly would not consider going to any other dental office.<//Review>

Dr  Hansen makes anyone’s smile beautiful.
The hygienist, Shelly, is so kind and very gentle while she cleans my teeth. My daughter said she nearly fell asleep.
Dr Hansen’s equipment is the newest and best.  I’d highly recommend this dental office to anyone, and I already have.😊<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809b1fe559d012b9:0xdecd72765aa9d1b6</GmapID></record>

The best dentist I ever had! I am in my sixties and have had many dentists over the years. Dr. Hansen is by far the absolute best. He is excellent at administering novocaine with little to no pain. He is exact, strong and best of all, he is fast. I always receive compliments on my smile and it is all due to Dr. Hansen’s expert care.<//text>

Dr. Hansen did my veneers about 18 years  because of severe Tetracycline staining. I reviewed several dentists and based on his reviews from others, the staff and the time he spent  to discuss the process, I decided to go with him.  It was the best choice that I made.  I moved out of the Sacramento area and still drive a couple of hours for my dental care twice a year.  Thanks Dr. Hansen for the wonderful smile!<//review>

DOES NOT DO IV SEDATION!! Even though all over the website they state that the doctor himself performs the IV sedation, the contact point informed me that it was a separate doctor who used to do it but they do not anymore. Why is it all over the website if it’s no longer performed?!< /Review>

I went to Dr.Hansen for some cosmetic work that I was really insecure about, I was born with out my laterals. It was a sensitive subject for me because I have been bullied though out high school and with just having a flipper it was hard for me to be confident because it’s something that can be so easy removed and with me being so young I wanted something more permanent. I have been looking around for years for someone I can fully trust, that would listen to my every need and want, that would do a really realistic job, after seeing my sisters teeth and finding out she married into a family that had a dentist that worked on teeth cosmetically I thought why not, I seen his work and if I was going to give my money to anyone it would be someone that I can trust. Let me tell you! Best Customer service I could ever have. Always walked in greeted with a smile, always told to hold myself to any snacks or coffee. Dr. Hansen held my hand all the way. This was the first time I ever did anything this “Adult” he broke down the prices, the process and any questions I had little or small he ever made me felt uncomfortable or made me feel stupid or over Whelming if I seen something I wanted tweaked or just touched up. Such a kind and loving, understanding staff and dr. I will be returning here for now on for all of my dental work, wants and needs. I will he referring all my friends, clients and family to him. Amazing job, teeth look so beautiful natural and amazing experience. Highly recommend!< /text>

I actually look forward to visiting my Dentist (Dr. Hansen & his staff. The office is beautiful, comfortable and spotless! I am always kept comfortable- a neck pillow, sunglasses and state of the art equipment. I grew up with a very different experience and had a lot of dental issues! A LOT! I used to be terrified of any dental appointment - my guess is this is typical for most people. Once I came to Dr. John Hansen it all changed!  Trust me- this is A five star experience! If you have any doubt - just look at my smile!!!<//Text>

Everyone at Dr Hansen’s office was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. I saw Dr Thompson and he answered all my questions and went out of his way to accommodate me.

They didn’t make me wait and made me feel like I was important. Overall it was a good experience. I will be back as needed.< /review>

<Review>Dr Hansen and his staff were so kind and friendly. I chipped my tooth on Sunday and they made sure I was in and taken care of by Monday afternoon. Always a little scary meeting a new dentist, but this crew made the whole experience a delight. So happy and grateful I feel confident smiling again!

I cannot say enough in praise of Dr. Hansen and his staff. I have been dealing with ongoing complications resulting from previous trauma to my front teeth. Dr. Hansen replaced my front tooth with an implant, and I could not be happier with the result. Dr. Hansen and his team are incredibly talented, knowledgeable, and make even the most difficult procedures as pleasant and comfortable as possible. I feel very fortunate to have access to such a remarkable team.</text>

Best dental office I have ever been treated at, and I have been to quite a few, believe me!
Staff members are amazing, Doctor Hansen is a great professional, environment is soothing and cozy - exactly what you need if you are someone like me - picky and pain in the butt kind of patient  lol
Looooove Dr. Hansen and his dental family!<//Review>

<text>I have been a patient of Dr. Hansen's for many years. Even after I moved 20 miles away I still make the trip for my dental care. He is not only an excellent dentist, he is a kind and caring person. When I've had emergencies he's always fit me in, and when I needed a root canal he made sure I was seen by an endodontist that day. His staff is excellent as well and are always kind and friendly. I highly recommend Dr. Hansen.</text>< pics>

Shelly, my dental hygenist, Dr. Thompson and the office staff are all AMAZING. I followed Shelly from my previous dentist and she is the sweetest and best dental hygenist that I have ever had. She really makes sure to take my special needs into account when cleaning, etc. And Dr. Thompson is a great dentist that does fabulous work! Love this office so glad I made the switch!< /Text>

Dr. Hansen and his amazing staff have seen
to my dental care for over 15 years. I came to the office with a myriad of problems that Dr. Hansen turned into a model smile. He is a
perfectionist who stands behind his work. His
staff , from the front desk,to the assistants, hygienist and lab are unfailingly caring, gentle, capable and professional. I can honestly say that I have never been to a better dental practice.< /text>

I really like and appreciate Dr. Hansen and his team.  They are friendly, accommodating in scheduling and provide excellent service during visits.  They are honest, knowledgeable and realistic about on-going care plans.  Their office is comfortable and equipment is modern which helps eliminate discomfort vs. traditional treatment methods (e.g. water scaling vs. hand tool only for cleanings).  I also had my mercury fillings replaced with porcelain.  There was almost no soreness or pain, during or after.  Dr. Hansen has proven to be my family's trusted dental provider.  It is without hesitation that I recommend their office.</review>

Dr. Hansen and his staff have created the most professional and enjoyable environment in basically any industry I can think of, and having been away for ten years it seems to have only improved in that time. That to me is the most impressive part. It is hard to maintain let alone build upon an already stellar company culture. From this, everything else flows naturally, and they clearly employ the best care and practices in their work. I love going in for checkups and cleanings here, and will never go anywhere else.<//review>

Easy, painless, and pool of talented professionals who always seem to be having a great day.  Lets face it we all have are fear of Dentists, I did.  Not any more.   I'm the benefactor of Dr. Hansen's passion to create the perfect smile for each of his patients.< /Text>

Phenomenal dentistry and traditional customer service values that are hard to Find in today’s day and age. I was referred to Dr. Hanson by a dear friend of mine who raved about his work I have since referred my wife as well. And example of this customer service I had a urgent situation today being a Saturday and he took the time leaving his family to come down and open his office to treat my situation and he did a phenomenal job at it! I can’t say enough great things about he and his staff thank you for your time< /Text>

I had severe gum disease and bone loss, combined with severe dentist phobia. Dr. Hansen not only gave me the most beautiful smile but he and his staff made me feel safe. He really does practice pain free restorative dentistry and cosmetic dentistry. I needed fillings, crowns, extractions, bone grafting, screw placement, and veneers. I now have healthy gums and a smile that looks real! People ask me which whitener I use but no one has ever asked if my teeth are my own! He is a true artist! He gave careful thought to every step of curing my gum and bone loss/disease and it was fun to watch him create my new smile. He is so amazing that my sister, who also has the same problems I have, including dental phobia, had him create demtal health and a new smile for her! His patience, kindness, and incredible skill set have changed my life as well as my sister's. Our daughter drives 90 miles to see him! We call him our wizard because he literally cured me of my terrible phobia and he did that while doing extensive work on me! I really cannot say enough good things about him, his staff, and how they run their practice.<//Text>

While living in Truckee, CA., John Hansen was recommended to us with words/expressions like: he's very gentle; he listens; he is on the faculty at dental schools; he makes "going to the dentist" a much easier and pleasant experience, he is the "go to" cosmetic dentist for veneers.
That was 8-10 yrs ago.........my wife, Linda, has spectacular veneers and we continue to use the office of John P. Hanse, DDS and experience the warm, friendly atmosphere. I recommend John to everyone.</review>

Going to Dr. Hansen's office is as much of a pleasure as you can when you're actually going to a dentist LOL. The place has a great ambience, the staff are engaging, the hygienists are gentle, and Dr. Hanson  and his  dental technicians are pros.  I am an airline captain for American Airlines and I know what professionalism is.  These guys are solid.< /Text>

It is my absolute pleasure to share my opinion and experiences regarding Dr. John Hansen and his amazing staff.  First, I must say I feared all dentists,  from terrible experiences, all my life before my early 20's.  I avoided them.

Many years ago, I was very fortunate to have been referred to Dr. John Hansen - BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME!  He has been my exclusive dentist since then.  He is so talented, knowledgeable, compassionate and caring to his patients.  He has a way to give you shots that really reduces any pain.  He is always on the cutting edge with techniques, tools, and materials!   I get excited when I have an appointment now!   As well as treating my general needs, he also put in my Vaneers!  He is an artist!

When you walk into the office, you are saturated by the entire environment of the beautiful office and welcome greeting by name.  There is water with fresh fruit in it and other refreshments.   Amy welcomes you (or Michael- both are are great) and checks you in.  It is a family environment and you feel part of that.  Everyone who works there is tremendous.  I want to name them all but I fear I will leave one out!  Shelly does my cleaning and prep work on a regular basis and continues the professional knowlegeable theme.  Everyone works together so well.

Before being treated for Cancer, Dr. Hansen helped me prepare for the damage cancer can cause to your gums and teeth.  It was important because during my cancer treatments, I could not do regular care.  Fortunately, when my oncologist called me a “medical miracle” for surviving my rare stage 4 Cancer, I decided to treat myself to Vaneers.  That was a life changing experience that allowed me to smile joyfully at my success.  His artistry is well acknowledged.

I love everything about going there and always look forward  to my appointments.   I highly recommend using the services provided.  You can’t do better than this!</text>

John Hanson DDS is a great dentist with good technique, knowledgeable, and a great office staff. Unfortunately, his rates are excessive when compared to other dentist providing the same quality of care. Additionally, his office provides no discount for patients without insurance which is unfortunate.</Text>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr. Hansen's for over 15 years.  He is a superior dentist and is also a kind, and gentle human being. Over the years he has done amazing things with my teeth.  Other dental practitioners, ( periodontist's, etc.) have commented on his work.
I recently had my scheduled cleaning and Shelly, the hygienist, is also excellent.
The care I receive at Dr. Hansen's is the best and I would recommend his office to anyone.

Decent place to watch a movie. Usually not very crowded when I have went, although never been to any premieres or during general peak hours. Everyone has been courteous and all around a nice experience every time. Regular seats as opposed to the luxury recliners a lot of places are starting to put in but not uncomfortable or anything. Pretty sure this is the only large cinema in Auburn? 4 stars since no competition to compare to.< /Text>

I absolutely love this theater. They've got parking like a costco and it may be pretty standard but it's very clean and nice for one of your smaller theaters and the staff do a good job. Popcorn has seen better days but otherwise great experience.<//text>

<text>Shared a good movie with some friends. Ford vs Ferrari.  Greatly entertaining.  Theater is obviously cutting back costs.  No box office, have to go in stand in food concession line to buy tickets.  Marquis no longer has movie titles, individual theaters have no movie names over them.  Very strange.  Movie start times not posted anywhere.  Hope this place is still around for a while.   Doesn't look good.   Theaters clean, people friendly.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1574314483236, 'text': 'Ron  thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback, we will share this with our team!

I live much closer to the theaters in Roseville than Auburn but my wife
and I like this theater a lot.
We might be the only people in the world that hate designated seating
but because this place does not have it is one of the reasons we go there.
It also helps that this place is clean, has easy parking, friendly staff and
the popcorn is always fresh.<//review>

The line for movies combined with the line for food is ridiculous...I hope it's temporary. If so, I'll improve my rating. Also, the prices for food is exorbitant. With the amount of business you do, be innovative and lower the prices. I understand why the price of movies is high but popcorn?< /text>

It really stunk how you had to stand in line at the snack bar to get tickets for the show.. Also they took down the Marquis. We had a voucher for paid tickets but they didn't know how to use it. Not good!<//text>

<text>Great movie theater like the way it was yesteryear. And the way it should be experienced in a detached unmalled, uncrowded venue in a charming small town setting. Comfortable seats, delicious artery-clogging  food, kind and attentive staff, and a movie experience I've come to love week-after-week. Its rare today to
find a "standalone" movie theater detached from a mall that is enjoyable and fun. I've never seen a theater with its own parking lot all by itself along a country road. Best of the best west of the Pecos !!</text>< Pictures>

Good theater with generally nice staff. The only downside of this theater is the seats. It's worth the drive to go 20 minutes further to Roseville to get the designated seats and recliners. But this is a good place if you dont want to travel too far to see your flick.< /text>

Just a little ways from a main road, it is easy to access, but kids and pets are safe from high speed drivers. The staff is always courteous, the place clean, and the snacks good.

<text>The only reason it's getting 3 is because of the staff behind the counter at the snack bar. The woman behind in the Box office was really nice and friendly, so was the guy who told us where the theater was. The kid behind the snack bar however was very impatient and short with us. You could just tell by his mannerisms he didnt want to be there. Hopefully he was just having an off day......</text><name>Brock Jensen<//name><date>1559538789965<//date>< rate>

Enjoyed the movie. Regular seats. Arcade could use some new games. A game ate a few tokens but didn't work. Update: bumped a star for the manager's response.  I will call and see if we can bump it all the way up to 5.  Thanks for reaching out.< /Review>

The only reason I got here is because to watch a movie for cheap on Tuesday.  This the worst movie theater I have been in for awhile.  The place is not very clean and staff are unhelpful.  There are much better theaters but are not located nearby.   The owners need to take time and train the staff better and spend some time and money cleaning.< /text>

Theater is nice as always. The ordering of our tickets online was great. The only thing negative I would say is that something about your popcorn upsets my stomach. I am thinking it is either the oil that the popcorn is popped in, or the butter topping that is put on the popcorn after it is popped. I have tried it a few times now, and always has the same affect.< /Text>

Great sound! Theater 1 had a large screen with plenty of seats for opening night of the Adventures: End Game. And staff made sure to restock restroom supplies. However, the theater was so full that halfway through the movie, it was almost unbearably hot and muggy. The movie was great!< /Review>

<text>I have now been to a regal Auburn on three occasions. My judgement: compared to Century, it is expensive ($12.25 on a typical evening; $6 on Discount Tuesday) and wait times are ALWAYS long to purchase tickets. The ticket booth is always empty, necessitating that customers purchase tickets at the concession stand, where there is ALWAYS just one person selling tickets. On two occasions, other employees walk by/up to the cashier and engage in chatter while standing around concessions, ignoring the long line, allowing just the one cashier to deal with the crowd, of course resulting in long wait times.</text>< Pics>

Well-maintained theater with stadium seating. A bit on the smaller side, so the large crowds on opening night end up going somewhere else. The employees could use a bit more pride in their work, but that's okay. Usual, classic concessions available.<//review>

<Review>Decent theater with decent screens and decent service. It is pretty clean, which I definitely appreciate. I feel like it could really step up its game, though - many theaters I've gone to in recent years have a LOT more concession stand options. Here, if you want food, they pretty much just have popcorn, hot dogs, "nachos" (just a bag of chips with liquid cheese, no other topping options) and candy. Don't come to a movie hungry, haha.

Sometimes the screens are a little grainy during dark scenes.

Overall I like this theater, but for standard ticket prices, I feel like I could be getting more elsewhere.</Review></record></dataset><record>

If you want to have an entire theater full of people talking during a movie you paid to see, then this is your place.  For some reason they put up a barricade and blocked off a large portion of the seats.  We were squeezed in like sardines, even after some people stepped over the barricade. These are all problems that should be taken care of by the manager.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

I always enjoy it here.    Constant attention by movie companies, plenty of openings.  Clean and safe for kids, attendants keep theatres clean and aromatic ( though butter after smell is unavoidable.)<//review>

We really like this theater.  Hardly ever a line, comfortable, close to home.  Other than the miserable commercials you have to watch if you sit down before the previews start, and the 20 minutes of previews that start at the scheduled screening time, it's a good local experience.  I know I can arrive  10 minutes after start time, get a ticket, popcorn, and a choice of seats just as the feature is starting!<//text>

<review>Ample parking, very comfortable chairs to watch 13th the movie. The only drawback is overpriced items in the snack bar. $5 for a small bag of Cheetos-popcorn, $5 for bottled water.

For the Auburn area this is really your only option for a movie theater unless you want to drive all the way down to Rocklin... With that being said this place still does a really good job even though it's the only place to go for movies. Clean bathrooms, courteous staff and a great selection of recently released movies. My husband and I have been to this theater three times since moving to the area and I think this will be our "go to" movie theater for years to come.< /Text>

If you live in the area you know why I gave it 5 stars. Close to home, not overly packed like most of the theaters in Roseville, most nights. If there's a big new release, there might be a line, but you can buy your tickets in advance and it's not overpriced for the location.< /text>

<review>Matinee/senior prices make going a bit less shocking. You’ll still wonder at the gall and greed of snack bar prices. A Dollar Tree pre-shop and full pockets solve that nuisance. Comfy seats although the head restible high backs make me a tad queasy when you consider the parade of unclean, potentially vermin infested heads that have rested in your chair. Ewyuk! Easy hopping.<//review></record>

Join their Regal club & get a card to acrue points to redeem for popcorn, etc.  Use it when you buy tics & food. Can get their phone app.  Redeem pts for popcorn ONLINE on the app as it's 1,000 pts less than if you redeem when you buy tic @ the window.  ( not sure why )< /review>< time>
