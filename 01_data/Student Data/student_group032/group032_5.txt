A wonderfully clean and friendly store!  I come here for my animals' needs and treats - dogs, rabbits, rats, tortoises and gecko!  The staff is very helpful and helped me find the perfect dog food when my little guy had medical issues.  They have a good variety of refrigerated food for dogs too!  I enjoy shopping here and look forward to each month when they host The Rabbit Haven team.  The bunnies are SO cute!  When you adopt a bunny there, the store gives you a generous discount on all your food and supplies - best prices for bags of Timothy/Orchard hay!

Keep up the great work, For Other Living Things Staff!!<//Text>

Coming from Seattle, where the large national pet stores are extinct, I couldn't find food and products I had become used to. For some reason Google never brings up this place when asking for pet food, however I was glad when I did find this place. Friendly staff, raw food and high quality pet food products.<//Review>

I've brought my business here for 4 years, even after moving out of dtla, and am always glad I do.  Michael and all the staff are always very helpful and friendly.  It's one of the most efficient shops I've visited which carries a Yuuuuuge selection of products, including the rare and much needed NOW brand for seniors.  Thanks guys, great job.<//review>

<Review>They sell healthy rabbit food (hay selection is great) and host a rabbit rescue organization on the first Saturday of each month. $5 donation gets you a health checkup and nail trim for your rabbit.

<Review>So glad I found this place! Anita helped me special order the specific crate I needed, and she had it for me by the time my furry friend was released from the ICU after surgery. So thankful to her for going out of her way to track down the vendor, order and have it in stock for me when I needed it. If you need that personal touch, this is the place to go.< /Review>< Pictures>

The owner of the store is such a sweet guy and is amazing at making you feel like your at home even though it’s just a water store!! He helps you out as much as he possibly can (even filling the jugs and bringing them to your car!) and the prices are so fair! I get the alkaline water with the high ph and it’s only $1 a gallon! He also sells jugs of all sizes and water dispensers. I adore this guy even though it’s only my second time meeting him and this shop is absolutely my favorite water store I’ve been to in San Diego! The water tastes great and the owner is just the sweetest and I absolutely truly recommend this store.< /review>

I have been going to Healthy Water for years!  Family-owned, very friendly service, reasonable prices. We bring in our empty bottles and he fills them in a matter of minutes. They also sell 3 and 5 gallon bottles and dispensers, if you need them. Cash only.<//review>

<text>**Update**
Since my last review I can only add to how impressed I am with service and quality of their water.  They also offer Alkaline water which is what I prefer.

My wife and I had a little girl since our last review and all through those trying months my wife and I were drinking this water.  After our baby was born, we had also used the water for not only our consumption, but also for making our little girl's bottles because of the water's purity.

Overall still the only water we drink and not only is it so much cheaper than buying bottle water but it tastes better and your purchasing from a wonderful family owned business.

*Original Post*
I've been going to Healthy Water for about two months now.  Family owned and how more polite, friendly, and helpful can they be?  I previously used a Brita then PUR filters with my tap water, but that only filtered out some of the particulates in the water.

Healthy water has a top of the line water filtration system that even removes the fluoride amongst many other unwanted contaminants that carbon filters cannot .  The owner explained to me that they perform consistent maintenance to keep their filtration system clean which I can't say for other water stores.  The purity is amazing and the price is right!

My wife who is now six months pregnant loves carbonated water so we use the water with a Soda Stream to make sure she always has the best carbonated water.  I'm writing this review because I am about to head on over and get a refill for my jug and right now I wouldn't be going any place else.  I will try out the alkaline to see if it's worth it.

Five stars.< /text>< Rate>

I think stores like this are the heart of the American body. Offering Ph Balanced Water (Alkaline Water for $5 for a 5 gallon jug is an amazing price for a premium product. There's also reverse osmosis water here as well that's just as fantastic.< /Review>

Friendly and helpful. I typically run in drop off my jugs and wait by my car with my 3 kids. The owner will bring the water to my car which is very helpful and appreciated!</Text>

Been going here for years for water. The owner is really nice and helps customers if they request help. I'm glad they offer alkaline water as well since it's expensive when you buy it from grocery stores by the gallon.</Review>

<Text>I love coming here the girls are not only talented stlylists but are genuine sweethearts as well. I can't say enough about both Liz and Nylene. ( I hope I spelled that right, apologies if I didn't!). Just wish the owner would invest some cash in upgrading the place, it needs to a facelift.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>Excellent customer service! My family has been so impressed with this dental office! Every single person treats you with kindness and provides stellar service. They are transparent right up front as to the patient portion and the insurance portion. The dentists are top notch along with every employee. They work with you on scheduling and even offer Saturday appointments!  It’s hard to find an office like this so we are grateful we were referred to this office.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Phenomenal experience today!

I was referred to the office by my husband, brother and mother - they did not disappoint!

The front desk receptionist was very pleasant and courteous. Kurtis, who was very thorough, kind and conversational, took me back to the first area for my initial scans and exam with Dr. Joseph. So impressed with the cleanliness of the office while walking through and felt very much at ease with the level of professionalism I experienced.

I was able to speak directly with Dr. Joseph, which I had not been able to do at my last dentist office. She took the time to talk with me regarding my dental concerns and what would be best going forward. I really appreciated her allowing me her full attention and addressing my concerns in a very direct manner. No nonsense - I loved it!

Alli was the hygienist performing my cleaning. She was so informative and direct in what she would be doing. Took the time to explain the cleaning procedure and why I would need a deeper cleaning today. She also made sure I understood not all cleanings would be like today. She was very sweet and even though it was a partial deep cleaning, honestly, that was probably the best teeth cleaning I have ever had! So thorough and efficient. Again, 100% impressed.

I have a couple follow up appointments scheduled and I can truthfully say I’m excited to go back! Thank you to the Delta Bay Dental team!< /review>< Pics>

I was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago. At the beginning stages of chemo, my teeth and mouth were affected greatly. Dr. Joseph and the staff have gone above and beyond for me. She’s an extraordinary Dr. with a beautiful heart. Thank you so much, from my heart to yours.< /Text>

Their COVID protocols are done very well and they don’t make you feel horrible while proceeding through them. Light hearted conversation is easy to come by. Personally, the numbing for my cavity fills was excellent and I didn’t feel a thing. Look forward to making this my permanent Dental office after my first three visits. Keep up the good work 👍🏾</text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I postponed making a dental appointment for years, after a painful visit at another office.

The staff all wore masks and was very friendly. My temperature was taken right away. In the spotless examination room, a late model air purifier showed their commitment to providing a safe experience.

Dr. Rontal was warm and welcoming. She thoroughly checked my teeth and ordered a full mouth x-ray. I was beginning to feel at ease.

Christine, the dental hygienist, was also friendly
and thorough. It was apparent that I hadn’t had my teeth cleaned for years. She did a wonderful job in clearing the plaque.

If you’re like me and dread the dentist, do come to see Dr Rontal. You too will be glad you came.
I wish I could give 10 stars.

Most of my experiences have been professional, and pleasant, but on two occasions during the pandemic, I was subjected to unsafe experiences. On one occasion a fellow patient stood less than two feet from me, and know one said a word. The second time, a woman without a mask walked into the office, talked to one of the receptionist, and was allowed into the rear, still with no mask.< /text>

It was the first time to this office. From the initial greeting to the end was a very pleasant and thorough exam. They made me feel very comfortable, like I had been a long time patient. The assistant and Dr. Eva explained every part of the exam and did a great job. They can now count me in as a regular. I recommend them highly.</Review>

< Review>
My procedure today went extremely well.  I am a patient that is terrified of dentist and I came to the dentists office quite nervous.  Dr. Tane  Rontal put me at ease as she continued extracting two teeth. She administered enough medication so that  I felt nothing!  The numbness has long since worn off and I am comfortable with no noticeable pain!  My visit today to Delta Bay Dental was the best experience for such major dental procedure  I have ever had.  I highly recommend Dr Rontal and her staff who where also wonderful.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>This was my fourth visit and saw Tina, the hygienist to complete my deep cleaning. Tina along with the entire staff is amazing. They are very happy you are there and do everything and more to make you feel comfortable.

Tina was always checking in with me to ensure I wasn’t feeling any pain or discomfort. She cheers you on, gives you updates on where she’s at and to ask if you need a break.

As I said in my last review this dental office is really the one to go to..especially if you are a nervous dental patient or maybe, like myself, feeling a bit embarrassed, for waiting so long to go. There is no judgement. They are just happy you are there.

Do something nice for yourself and you will be smiling even more.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Great service and staff. Even though the doc revealed  that I need a number  of unexpected procedures, the level of care was very good. I had to get 2 filings replaced. Dr. Eva was very gentle and caring realizing that it was a necessary evil.  Most recently, my crown from another dentist fell out be night.  I left a message after hours, they called me back and I was able to get it fixed the next day. Again, amazing customer service.
2/10/21- again Dr Eva made an otherwise unpleasant experience of getting a crown, not so bad. She and  all the friendly, caring staff make trips to the dentist  not so bad.

3/4/21– Again Dr Eva  made my visit not so bad. She is a skilled gem. The assistant/ hygienist was excellent and very welcoming</Text></record>

From the Moment you went in the door you were reassured about everything and every protection was given and adhered  to for Covid safety
Dr.Tane was just a delight and very reassuring as I am not a “good” dental patient!
She showed me pictures of areas that needed attention, no pressure.
Marsha reassured me during all x-rays and diagnostic procedures,Christine (last but not least)did my cleaning and recommended mouthwash. I am so happy I chose delta bay dental. Also thank you to great front office staff that are working with my Insurance
All in all a great first experience, which for me with a dentist is pretty good!,</text>< Pictures>

<review>My family believes that Delta Dental is wonderful and provides the best t dental care that any of us have ever received..

They go out of their way to ensure that we are completely satisfied with their care and they make sure we know and understand everything  that is happening. We have received  dental care  all over the United States and Japan . No other dental service has been as good.</review>< response>

I have been going Delta Bay Dental since we moved to Brentwood...over 18 years.  Our family has been real happy witht them
They are very friendly and do a fantastic job with our dental needs.  We will be moving to Copperopolis (1.25 hours away) in April, but will still be coming back for my dental needs. I hoghly recommend them.< /review>

Delta Bay Dental is an awesome dental practice to have your dental work done.  The staff is amazing and they treat you like you are their friend, rather than a patient.  Dr. Rondel is a top notch dentist as well as a concerned and caring dentist.< /text>

I came to this office looking for a second opinion from a different Dentist and was able to get booked and seen within a week.
I have always had a wonderful experience with this office. Every staff member I have interacted with is kind and welcoming.
I have seen Dr. Ava for all of my visits and she is by far my favorite out of all the Dentists I have ever had. She makes sure to ask and answer thorough questions, take her time, address every issue I have and is just wonderful!<//Text>

I have been here many times lately and the staff is always nice and friendly and always concerned about my comfort, health and asking me if I am okay during procedures. They care that I am happy with my crowns comfort wise and the way they look. I also like that I get to listen to music while in the chair<//review>

My 9 year old was back again for some more work.  This time he had Dr. Eva Gasior.  She too was awesome, very kind and made sure my child felt at ease with more fillings.  This time he he had upper and lower fillings done.  Dr. Gasior was sweet and made sure he was going to be okay with doing that.  Honestly, they treat your child like their own.  Not that I wish more fillings or dental work on my child but should they have more work done now or later in life, Dr. Gasior would most certainly take good of them.  All of the dentists and staff would take great care of your family.

My 9 year old had his first of three visits to take care of some fillings. I was nervous and anxious for my child as this is his first fillings. Dr. Joseph Nau and the denta hygienist (sorry forgot name) were so awesome. They made him feel so at ease and comfortable. He did so much better than I expected. I’m so glad to have transferred my kids to this dental office also. He actually does not mind going back again to have his fillings done.

Previous visit:
I have been going there for years with my husband and recently I have my kids going there also.  They are always very thorough and they explain all procedures to me prior.  My dental hygienist Ally is the best, she is kind and does an excellent job.  She has been working in my mouth for years and honestly I don't ever want to see anyone else.  I almost look forward to going to the dentist.</Text>< pics>

Since day one, this dental office has made me feel comfortable and safe every time I walk in. I had a lot of dental work to do and Dr. Tane explained everything to me, made sure I was comfortable and supported me through my fear of the dentist.

Very professional without being pushy. Options are discussed for current and future care without feeling obligated to do something immediately. Explanations are clear. Costs are typical for procedures and  there is no confusion about insurance matters. A terrific group of people to work with.<//text>

They answer all my questions, they make insurance and payment options clear and easy to understand BEFORE I choose the work i need done. They do such great work and I feel well taken care of.

Very friendly staff. Made me feel very comfortable during my visit. Dr. Ava was very warm & talked me through each thing she was doing to my teeth & helped me to feel relaxed. Her assistant was also very warm & sweet. They answered all my questions & were very professional. The office is also very clean which is super important to me. I'm a happy patient!</Review>

Dr. Tane Rontal and her staff I rate 5 out of 5. They are professional, warm, and welcoming. I completely trust Dr.Rontal to give me my dream smile. I’m currently in the process of getting porcelain veneers. It’s not the easiest process but Dr. Rontal and her staff make it as easy as possible. She also has treated a couple of cavities I had, which went well.

Dr. Rontal is very patient and truly listens to what I want and looking for in a smile, as well as very informative, and skilled at what she does. I’m very glad I found her during my google search while looking for a dentist. She and her staff make a visit to the dentist office as pleasant as possible. I can see myself being a loyal customer for years to come.  I highly recommend Delta Bay Dental Group.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I had my first visit with this dental group on 9/19/19.  They were recommended to me by both my son and son-in-law.  I was very impressed with the professionalism, thoroughness, and friendliness of everyone in this office.  Right from the moment I was greeted by the front desk staff when I arrived, I felt  welcomed.  Since it was my first time there, Dr. Joseph examined my teeth  carefully to assess any issues.  She was so complimentary of the condition of my teeth.  She took photos of a couple of problematic areas and shared them with me while she clearly explained the issue and her plan of action.  She has such a pleasant, calming personality. Christina is so sweet and an excellent hygienist.  She was very gentle, and my teeth felt great when she was finished cleaning them.  She, too, was very complimentary of my teeth and home care routine and took the time to point out areas where I could do an even better job of brushing.   I've requested her for my next cleaning appointment.  I am one completely satisfied new patient.  I really liked everyone I met during my visit and would definitely recommend this dental group!

Follow up:  I returned the next month in order to have Dr. Joseph change out an old filling and fix a couple of small chips in two other teeth.  I have to admit I wasn't the least bit nervous about having dental work done since they were so gentle with my routine cleaning the previous month.  Dr. Joseph and her assistant numbed me up sufficiently that I didn't feel a thing throughout the entire procedure.  They took me in right on time, and I was out in an hour.  I am extremely pleased with the work that was done on my teeth.  I've had absolutely zero post-procedure issues.  Again, Dr. Joseph was so sweet and very warm and friendly.  I am really thrilled with my new dental office.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>Every time we are here (which is frequently with 5 of us) we are treated with kindness. The front office staff are friendly and organized. Our 3 kids like getting their teeth cleaned and always report that they had a nice time. Each dentist is friendly and thorough. Each hygienist is great with all of us, always prepping for what is coming next. I would definitely recommend this dental office to anyone.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I saw Dr.Gaisor yesterday for the first time. I have never experienced such a detailed checkup! She performed a cancer screening and even noticed my thyroid scar. With every touch she explained in detail what she was doing which was also new for me. I am not a nervous dentist client but i am sure her confident, calm demeanor and patient/doctor communication would put a scared client at ease as well. The whole staff is so nice too.<//review>

This Dental Group is above all.

Staff are kind and accommodating. They all know their clients dos and don’ts. I can be a difficult person to please especially at the dentist. They all make my appointments special. I Leave there wondering why I hate going to the dentist.
I always get a feeling of family when I am there and when they call me the feeling is there.

I can write forever and never cover what I feel of this place. We’ve (family of four) have been coming for more than 20 years.   Very grateful that they are my dentist office.< /Text>

<Text>This dental office is the best anyone could ask for. At 72 years of age I have visited many offices, but non as kind, caring and at the same time professional and excellent! The entire staff honestly cares about each patient and his or her life and well-being. Having recently moved away from Brentwood, I continue to commute to this office - that tells you how outstanding they are. I will not give up Dr. Joseph or her staff!! The excellent professional care, combined with the kind and caring people makes it a 12 out of a score of 10 for me!  Thank  you all at Delta Dental.< /Text>< Pictures>

I have been coming here since 2009. This is my first review. The front office staff is great to work with.  Always pleasant and helpful to answer any questions that I may have about billing.
I have had Ally as my hygienist since I started. She is absolutely amazing. I would see no one else (traumatized as a kid with the dentist). Ally went out on vacation and then medical leave. I couldn’t wait any longer as I had already gone over my 6 months.
I had an appointment with Tina and told her that I was a big baby - she said they updated me on everything. Yeah, they all know me. Haha.
Tina gets 10 stars. Not only was she great at putting me at ease, she didn’t even have to use the numbing gel that I always make Ally use before she even starts.
So for those that are apprehensive about the dentist, Ally and Tina are the best hygienists I have ever had.
The dentists are great as well. I love MD Joseph.
Great practice!!!!< /text>

They treat you as if you were part of their family and were extremely accommodating to my kids! The doctor did not rush through her explanations of what was going on with my teeth and was very patient with all of my concerns. Our Heigenist is Miss Christine and both of my kids love going to the dentist because of her wonderful and welcoming personality. I am so happy here and look forward to our next visit!!!<//Text>

<review>The reception staff at Delta Bay Dental Group are very efficient, courteous, and helpful. Dr. Eva Gasior was very efficient and knowledgeable, explaining what she was doing throughout the procedure. The last couple of visits were my first experience with Delta Bay and I've been very pleased with the professionalism exhibited by the entire staff. I did not have to wait more than a couple of minutes for my appointment.< /review><date>1552073811928< /date>< user>

Going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do but, since I have to go, I have to admit that I love Delta Bay. The Delta Bay team are very cheerful, personable, and professional. They really care about you and they always make sure you are comfortable. The team makes your experience at the dentist less painful and more enjoyable. I also like the offices. They are nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable.< /Review>

< Review>
I could literally fall asleep on the reclining chair, with their tv on and remote control in hand. So comfortable. It's like they're working on your teeth at the comfort of your own home. Only you are physically at their station. Staff are very informative especially if you ask questions about what they're doing on your teeth. Great customer interaction and service. I would highly recommend.</Review>

<Text>Our family went to this place because of the nice reviews,  now I wonder how they get those reviews??? Office staff is nice , but what a terrible job done by dentist??!  my husband had tooth filling back in Oct , my husband tooth is still in pain , he could not even bite with those tooth with filling done . He has no tooth pain at all before the filling work. My feeling is place is all care about charging money ,  not the patient !  Such poor quality of job !<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Staff were very professional and outgoing. From Marsha, who took my xrays, to Ali who cleaned my teeth (best cleaning I have ever had, by the way!) to seeing Dr. Joseph after finding her, for she used to work at my last dental facility.....my visit was outstanding! I highly recommend Delta Bay Dental Group, hands down, the best! Thank you very much to everyone....also to Kathy, Sally and Erin at the front desk!</review>

Great dentists, great hygienists, great front desk staff, great service, quality work.

Moved my 12 year old here for X-rays and cleaning and Dr. Joseph found something on his molars that any other dentist would have ignored.  There is no substitute for experience.

I am moving my family to these dentists, even though we live out of town.</Text>

I had my first appointment with Delta Dental Group on Wednesday, 3/20 using my new Humana Insurance Dental insurance benefit. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting this appointment to be anything special. I was surprised to find out that this is really a first rate organization. The office was spotlessly clean. Erin the receptionist was very friendly and efficient and I did not have to wait past my appointment time. The dental assistant was very competent and Eva Gastor, DDS was my dentist. She is a young and very professional and competent dentist. Overall, my experience was a very pleasant one and I recommend them to anyone seeking a new dentist. I look forward to using this dental firm from now on.

<review>Dr. Tane Rontal is an excellent Dentist.  As far as my dental work, she's done crowns, fillings and most recently, veneers.  She does a meticulous and flawless job.  I've never had a problem with any of it.  She's personable and friendly - I like her very much as I do her entire staff.  It's a great practice and I highly recommend it.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This was my first office visit and I was impressed by the professionalism shown by the staff, especially by the Dr. Martine Joseph Nau. She is the reason I chose this dental office, she worked at my last dental office and I had a very positive experience.</Review>

I have had a very traumatic dental experience at another office. Delta bay dental has made me feel safe going to the dentist again! Tina is the absolute best hygentist!!! She always makes sure I'm comfortable ☺️☺️ (I'm a HUGE baby when it comes to the dentist 😖) My son had is braces done by Dr. Rontal, and she did an amazing job!! I would HIGHLY recommend Delta Bay Dental!!<//text>

I had a good visit today. Office staff was pleasant and made me feel welcome. I had 2 cavities filled by Dr. Rontal. I never felt uncomfortable and was impressed by her skill and professionalism. I would recommend this dental office to others
Hygiene visit Aug. 30 2018 was very professional and relaxing 😎An annual x-ray was performed ( Pano ) and revealed health issues I wasn’t aware of. Staff and all were friendly< /text>

From my first appointment, I was pleased with the experience. The members of the staff are constantly cheerful and welcoming. Dr. Rontal, herself, always displays a cheerful and warm attitude. She would surely be the reigning Queen of Implants, if there were such a position. She transformed my smile by replacing seriously damaged teeth with no pain and almost no discomfort.

On more than one occasion, as I left the office I told her and members of her staff that they had made my experience as pleasant as a trip to the dentist could be.</review>< pics>

<name>Sylvia Turner< /name><text>Dr Rontal was very thorough and gave a very fair estimate on the costs to get my teeth where I want them. She was also able to refer me to an oral surgeon that is very competitive pricing for patients without dental, like me, so I can have 2 teeth pulled. Allie was my dental hygienist and she did an awesome job on cleaning my teeth. Even the ladies at the front desk were sweet and I will be referring all my friends to Dr. Rontal. I've had 2 additional appointments with Dr. Rontal and had different dental hygienists but all were equally awesome! I actually look forward to my appointments because the entire office is so nice! I'm lucky to have Dr. Rontal as my dentist!< /text></record>

< Review>
My  two daughter's have been patients with Dr. Rontal since we moved to Brentwood 9 years ago. A very pleasant & convenient office. Dr. Rontal & staff are professionals who's attended to my daughters every dental needs & always explained in details the work that needs to be done & the financial aspects of it, from what dental insurance will cover & any out of pocket cost to us.
I highly recommend Delta Bay Dental Group.</Review>

I am overwhelmed at the EXTREMELY Friendly, helpful Staff and Drs. Dr. Tone Rontel went completely out of her way to help me feel better!!!! I had 3 visits with her in 2 days, and really hope and pray that Louisiana Dentists can step up to this level of care. Thank you Dr. Tone Rontel and staff... and Dr. Martine Joseph for EVERYTHING you've done to make me feel better!< /text>

I have ordered daily from this Jamba because it's so close by. They have repeatedly screwed my orders up. I order through door dash. I have tried to buy oatmeal for the past week straight and they are always out. Usually out of stock or everything good food wise and it looks like they do not intend to re stock. I am disappointed. You would think after a week or more they would have product to sell.

*edit* I have had good experiences in the past. I am just unsure what is going on with the past week or two.</Text>

<Review>I placed a order online for pick up. I added extras through the app and when I picked it up I asked this lady working what was missing. She gave attitude and was very hesitant to add the extras. I paid for the extras so I don’t see why it was a problem for her. Horrible customer service. I didn't get her name but she's a thin lady with freckles.</Review>< pics>

<review>The juice was great, the service not so much. The girl at the registered just assumed we would know the difference whey protein vs. Soy. Instead of smiling and giving us a quick explanation and educating us for the next time, she gave us an eye roll. On top of that the music was so loud she couldn't understand us or us hear her. The gentlemen making the juice waa nice.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1531159876348, 'text': 'Thomas Abella we are sorry to hear about this and appreciate feedback.

Food is always good. Meat portions are average, but service was great, as usual, and awesome to support the local owners, and the causes they fundraise for.<//text>

Just once, barely edible heat lamp sitch. Flavor was there at some point on the fries but guests chicken sandwich was dry and seemingly overthrown by pickles: my burger came 20m later in a similar state. Light beer, cold and wet. Get to the Habit sooner rather than later<//Text>

< Review>
Very mediocre couple of burgers for my gf and me on our visit on 1/16/21. I got the mountain climber and my gf a simple Bacon cheeseburger. The beef was overcooked and dry for both of the burgers, and they messed up a few of the toppings so they replaced the burger but unfortunately the replacement was just as undesirable as the first. To top it all off, the soup of the day (tomato basil or something similar) tasted very off-putting. We didn’t finish any of our meal and instead checked out another of the many local options. Alas, $25 later...< /Review>

The chicken burger I got was delicious, love the buns! The service was great, food was fast, and the charity aspect is fantastic. Overall a win for me. The salad had a lot of dressing though, FYI. It was great for me, but a heads up to those of you who don't like their salads with a lot of dressing.< /text>

<text>Veggie patty on a baked fresh daily by and a almond berry salad made a perfect meal.  The patty wasn’t very flavorful but fresh, plant based and good for me! The salad was incredible with fresh strawberries and crisp greens with a great Erica portion of goat cheese.  Highly recommend this fasterant.<//text></record>

This Kyle's kitchen is a disaster. A single employee taking orders and wrapping food.

We had to end up yelling to get his attention because he wouldn't turn around after polite "excuse mes."

He was trying to handle our food with the same gloves he was using at the register to handle money. He seemed very annoyed when we asked him to change them before handling our food.

Between this and the raw chicken we've been served at another Kyle's location, it's clear management has given up on quality control.</Text>

Great lunch spot! Service was a little slow for the time of day we stopped in (earlier than lunch rush), but the place was nice and clean. The girl bussing tables was so sweet and attentive, and I love that they are giving back to the community. Fries were DELICIOUS.</text>

<Text>Menu needs to be updated
The fries were a little bland- needs more salt.
The earth burger is a little lacking, the ingredients are a little skimpy.
I ordered jalapeno fries and it had no jalapeno ranch. Makes me wonder if that's even a thing... The pepper jack on the jalapeno fries was not melted.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80e914790b7b426d:0x86b0777b30e61da7< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Kyle's Kitchen has great fast food. There's no denying it. It serves a great purpose, too by openly contributing a portion of it's profits to non-profits in the area and abroad. The hang-up for some people comes from it's prices. By the time you're done ordering you feel like you're spending as much on fast food as you would at any sit-down joint in town. So while they've got great fast food you won't be getting it for the fast-food price.</Review>< Pictures>

You have to go!

Not only is the messaging and mission of Kyle's Kitchen the best, the food is on point! Burgers are not gigantic, the perfect size, and are super tasty. Fries are better since the last time I had gone.

Service is so great! Lots of young folks  behind the counter working their first job, feels like a good team back there.

Great seating. Plays the games. Happy hour 3 to 6 I believe. Good beer!<//review>

Chapala location, I've not eaten here before and am shocked by the great reviews.  My California burger (which was a chicken breast entree) the meat was not even warm and tasted like cardboard, my friend's Ahi tuna burger was also cold with no taste, both items were also dry.  I did have my seasoned fries, which came with my meal, were also cold, got them replaced and even hot there was no flavor.  I reported the cold burgers to the guy behind the counter and he was willing to replace icky place.offered to</text>

Same menu as the Goleta location with similar ambience and signature service. Seemed a little louder and more echoing, but we were there on a Saturday night and the mall across the street was hopping. You get the feeling you're eating something a little healthier and fresher than many counter service offerings.<//text>

This time at the Kyle's Kitchen I was pleasantly surprised with the very best Earth Burger I've ever had! I'm not one for something trying to mimic a hamburger. I'd rather taste vegetables and legumes. While I love to eat vegetarian I am not actually a vegetarian. Which says a whole lot for his Earth Burger. I don't know what his recipe for this is but it is awesome! I adore the toppings on this Earth Burger. There are crushed avocado, arugula, caramelized onion, organic sprouts, tomatoes and garlic aioli. The Earth burger patty itself is a little on the soft side. You have to expect that because it is garbanzo bean based I think. I found that when I thought of it as a filling instead of a burger somehow in my mind it was even better. I'm telling you if you want a vegetarian burger, this is great!< /Review>

<time>1494119210651< /time><Text>This is a great spot for a casual bite.  The place is very well laid out and has comfortable seating inside our outside.  I had the Thai Peanut salad with chicken which hit the spot.  Oddly one of the best part of the salad was the bread roll—it was so light and airy.  When I’m back in town, I’ll definitely come here again.<//Text><gmapID>0x80e914790b7b426d:0x86b0777b30e61da7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good simple burgers and salads. My favorite is the Rustic Tuscan and Farmhouse Salad. Parking at the downtown location can be a pain but there a few parking spaces nearby without going into Paseo Nuevo parking if you know where to look</text>

Good burger spot with lots of options for kids and adults alike. Be sure to check out whichever burger is on special the day you visit, since it's usually a pretty good deal and all of their burgers are pretty good. (The Firefighter burger is my current favorite)<//text>

This is a great place with great food, very reasonable prices, and an amazing cause. My boyfriend and I stopped by for the daily happy hour from 3-6 pm. Local beers on tap and Kyle's burger for $4! It's awesome to know that your money is going towards a place advocating for people with special needs.< /Review>

LOVE the ethic, but the menu gets old. Was so disappointed that Kyle's has also replaced their Silvergreens restaurants. The food is decent at Kyle's  but not terribly exciting. We used to go with the family quite frequently, but it has lost some of its appeal. Menu really needs to be freshened up a bit.<//Text>

<Review>I rarely dole out five star ratings, but the fact that Kyle's represents and remains involved and active in a greater good, pushed my usual four stars for great dining up a notch. Aside from the mission behind the business, the food was impeccable. I recommend the Man Up (doubled, of course), the blue cheese bacon fries, & a birthday cake shake. I left full, pleased, & satisfied that my money had not only gone to a great meal, but to a good cause!</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Kyle's Kitchen was a great spot for me in Santa Barbara - it was fast, had non-beef options for all their burgers (ie: chicken breast or veggie burger substitutions across the board), great fries, and unique seasonal lemonades (watermelon lemonade was a winner!). Plus it was really affordable relative to other places in the area. Outdoor seating with shade was also a plus.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>The food is amazing, but the chicken on the Rustic Tuscan is about the thickness if three pennies. Even whith a side salad it's not a filling meal. The sandwich neads about double the amount of chicken to be on par with your everyday chicken sandwich.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHO9nJpbbzqxcy3m8Fp1rQiNJkvnPJG80yph_j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Good was great (earth burger with fire fries, California club, and earth burger wrap with Thai salad). Restaurant was clean with nice bathrooms. Good value for the price!<//text>

<Review>Food quality was ok. I stopped here for dinner on the way up to Pismo Beach. I was looking for a quick healthy meal before we hit the road again. The salad I got with strawberries was kind of soggy - I felt like I got the bottom of the bowl or something. It was pretty late when we ate there also, close to closing time. The service was also just OK. Staff was preoccupied with closing the restaurant down and didn't pay much attention to us. I like the string lights in the outdoor patio though.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>I love how they've added Kyle's kitchen to their menu options.  Can never go wrong with anything on the menu. I try to get something different every time I go, but I am a sucker for the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich.<//Review><Name>Rudy Meza< /Name>< Rating>

I love Silvergreens.  The food is great and the people there are always really nice.  I go there at least once a week for a breakfast burrito and usually another time for either lunch or dinner.<//Review>

Silvergreens is a nice place to get a decent lunch that's fresh and fast and easy. I especially like the calorie counts on the receipt that help you stay on top of your eating. Whether you're getting a burger or an entree the food is of a consistent caliber. The green fries aren't my thing but I can totally imagine other people loving them. If you're in Santa Barbara near State St. and you're looking for a no-fuss place to eat a quick meal that has a range of great options for all, this is a good spot to try.< /text>

The food was decent but unfortunately the restaurant lacked several menu items that we wanted to order.

It is a place for younger generation. I am a senior citizen and felt a bit out of place. The food and service is about average. The draw is that the establishment donates part of the proceeds to  cause.< /text>

<userid>108665359398265378306<//userid><Review>Nice little dinner spot that won't break your bank. The burgers are pretty dang tasty (those buns are soooo soft!) and they are only $6. The downside is that they are not the biggest burgers around. So you'll want at least fries with that or better yet a soup or a salad to get full. Also they don't have traditional sodas (no Coke or Pepsi products) so if you are looking for that you won't find it here.

I feel like the IV location used to have quicker service. Even when the place doesn't seem too busy, it can be a 10+ minute wait.<//Review>< user_name>

For under $15 you can get a burger, fries, and a drink. You can't say that across the street< /Review>

<Text>Silvergreen's makes it easy to eat healthy food, because it's actually GOOD.

The servers are always very attentive, and the green apple salad, as well as the El Capitan salad, are always delights!

I wish the receipts with all the nutrition information included sodium and carbs, though.</Text></record>

<Text>Very disappointed in my carry out today.  I ordered the cup of soup and half a salad.  I received no tortillas with my chicken tortilla soup and the lettuce in my salad was soggy and wilted.  It looked like it was left over from yesterday and given to me.  No roll was provided - it is suppose to be included.

(Translated by Google) The burger buns are really delicious. For $ 10 there is a menu with fries and drink. Cheaper you are in Santa Barbara probably not full.

Die Burger Buns sind richtig lecker. Für 10 $ gibt es hier ein Menü mit Fries und Getränk. Günstiger wird man in Santa Barbara wohl nicht satt.< /text>

<Review>If I could leave a 10 star review I would!!  These guys are the BEST!!  I was going to a different dentist who surprised me with a $1,700 bill if I wanted to complete my root canal.  Horrible!!  I searched for a new dentist and lucky for me, I found Dr. King and his WONDERFUL staff here at Elica Health Dental J Street!!  They are very professional, kind, understanding and sympathetic to the panicky feeling of tooth pain.  They saw me right away and made all the costs completely transparent and affordable. I want to thank all of them for being so understanding and kind!  And I want to thank Selena and Dr. King for explaining everything and listening to my dental fears.<//Review>< date>

Waiting room was empty on a Thursday afternoon(2:20pm-3:08pm),  but that's still not indicative of its daily occurrence. I can't speak on much else besides the limited parking lot having very narrow spaces because I was just transporting my brother here.< /Text>

<review>So I’ve read through the reviews and these folks are trippin. I had my first appointment today 12/30 at 9:20am. I scheduled it on 12/28. I was asked to come in 45 early. I arrived on time. The receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful. It was a lot of paperwork so I see the need for the early arrival. I was taken back to my room exactly at 9:20. The nurse assistant was nice but had a meh bedside manner but she was very young. I was seen by Dr. Vaid she was ultra professional and super tentative to my visit. The office is old, but very clean. Only reason they didn’t get 5 stars from me!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1609791729214, 'text': "Hi Theresa, thank you so much for the feedback!

<Review>I think this branch of Elica Health Center may be doing insurance fraud.  They scheduled appointed  and did not  accept the patient.  And having a checklist filed for insurance to reimburse the cost as for the work done.  I do not see any other reason why would the reschedule appointment 3 times in a row.</Review>< user_name>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>First off, I would like to say I have been in pain for a long time and I’ve been to the ER many times and seen other doctors and none of them have helped me or taken me seriously.  When I finally was assigned to see Dr. Baba At Elica  he made me feel very comfortable, and genuinely seem concerned about my symptoms. He put me in contact with specialist to treat my condition and has been a great help, and is always attentive to my health concerns. The staff at Elica are all nice, sweet and always pleasant. I never have to wait long for appointments, and this is the best experience I’ve had at a doctors office in a long time. Thank you Dr. Baba and staff for professional and friendly service!< /Review>< pics>

Scheduled me for an 11am PPD test. Didn't room me til 11:35. By 12:05, I still hadn't received my test and bounced. This is something that takes less than 5 minutes to administer and doesn't even require a provider.</review>

I would like to thank Dr. Vacura for my new dentures. I really appreciate the quality of work and kindness Dr. Vacura and the entire staff have shown me. It was a great experience and I love the way my new dentures make me look like a new person. It really gave me my self-esteem back, now I’m ready to get back into the work force. Thanks again to everyone.< /Review>

<Review>Unprofessional. Doctor keeps ordering unnecessary tests. Told me to come all the way there to pick up a lab order because they didn't know how to send it electronically. Admitted to not knowing much of anything about my most important health conditions. Said a certain "medical" website was the best for learning about things, instead of the knowledge they 'should' already have from being given a degree.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Have been there for a couple of pediatrician visit. Everything has been excellent, from front desk to the doctor, professional service.

Too bad people most of the time make bad reviews with a bad experience, but when there is chance for a good review, nobody takes the time.

Anyway, we are always treated very nice and with respect.< /Text>

In those cases, I've spent gas to get here & end up with extremely rude officer staff who blames us for being late. Seriously, I'm sorry there was an emergency & traffic was diverted, making us late.

I am their patient, and I like that the office is always improving. No-matter what happens they still work on getting better. About the previous comment for the non bilingual is false, because most of them do speak multi-languages. We just have to understand that we are not the only patient there, but there are a lot of people that seek help, and they are trying to help everyone.< /review>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I give 2 stars because of N.P Soba I  had gone to this clinic before and the front desk staff were nice the M.A. was rude but the doctor was nice. Then I went again and saw  nurse practioner Soba was her last name and I specifically told her I was allergic to an antibiotic and that is what she prescribed me! She didn't listen to me obviously and for me that's HUGE to have a health care provider NOT listen to you. The M.A the second time was nice and of course the front desk was also,  the wait time is good at this office 3701 J street.< /review>< Pics>

The Elica dental clinic J street is very unprofessional and unorganized. If your appointment is at 10:00 am the will you at 11:00 am. You are there for filling, but the pull out your teeth.</Text>

The Doctors are there to help you through your health issues instead of just running through the motions and writing you a prescription. Also other corporate med clinics like kaiser never prescribe painkillers to me because of my age and gender. I have broken a total of 23 bones in my life have been in the ICU twice for a total of 10 days all from streetbike accidents and am in great pain when I walk due to having shattered my ankle and having 5 screws put in. Therefore I am no lying when I say I'm in pain and Elica health centers doesn't discriminate, they treat all patients the same despite age and .gender.

<review>They refuse to provide referrals, make unnecessary appointments, very little mental health options.  They refuse to refer to other providers if they don't offer the service themselves.  They once tried to get me to go to three separate appointments to get a single employment physical done.

Refused to treat during an appointment, said I had to make a new appointment for every treatment, even if it was just asking a question.

Referred me to a social worker unqualified to treat my condition when I requested a psychiatrist.  Happened two separate times over two years.

This is not a medical provider, it is a scheme to bill your insurance as much as possible.<//review>< user>

Literally every time I come here the dr is behind. Like very behind. Last time it was 2 hours after my scheduled appointment that I finally made it to a room. This time over an hour just to see the dr.</text>

This is the worst place I have ever been too.  We have boon trying to get a referral since October 3rd.  Have been constantly lied to.  Told to come back and when we get there told that we did not have to come in because everything could have been taken care of on the phone.  Call back when asked too and then been told that nothing has been turned in.  This place is a complete joke.  I will now be looking into making complaints with the medical board. I have never dealt with such incompetence ever before.</review>

I used to be one of Dr. Waterbury's patients and I started off with a common cold! He sent me home saying it will get better. Then i tended up with pneumonia twice. Ended up in the hospital and had strep throat 2 times in 2 months! Horrible, self- righteous Dr. and a drunk on top of that! Nobody in his office answers the phones! Other Dr's. in this building are just as retarded amd bad except Dr. Gibson! Type in Jude T. Waterbury's name in on the internet and you will find out he killed 1 of his patients!<//text>

<text>If you want to feel like your health doesnt matter to anyone, this is the place for you! Worst experience I've ever had with a nurse practionar. Save yourself the trouble and skip going to this guy! Todd Goodenow was his name. He started out my new patient visit by noting how I put on my paperwork that I was depressed. I guess the nurse must've alerted him that i marked it down because he never looked at anything. He told me that I needed to see a psychotherapist. This was most likely the root of my fatigue without even looking at my chart. Very unprofessional and jumped to conclusions. He asked me if I'd ever been diagnosed with bipolar or schizophrenia without even really talking to me. I then refused any further services. I came in to establish a new Dr. since I just moved here and get my meds filled and figure out my fatigue problem, not have him judge me and make uneducated assumptions! 3 months later: Update, I went to 2 other Dr's none of them took me serious probably because Dr. Goodenows visit. I took a stool test ordered by a holistic dr. 10 years of misery this is the only man that could save me and It took about a month. At this point i can't walk sometimes due to the lack of nutrients and It turns out I was misdiagnosed and have giardia. If any of those Dr's would've taken the time to listen to me I could've been helped a lot sooner! 3 months later, Still haven't addressed my issues. The doctor called in the day of my last appointment and basically walked out of today's appointment with out any answers. I'm all out of hope!<//text>< pics>

I been with Elica for almost 3 years and have watched more good PAs leave and also I am going threw my 3rd pain management's doc leave, but what did it for me was when I went to see a MD in West Sacramento  for pain Managment I jfelt like I was being interrogated by this doctor he keep asking me personal questions even about my husband!! I asked him why was he asking me such personal questions about a law suit I had filed and he wanted to know how much I got. This did it for me! I had a spinal fusion 2 1/2 yrs ago why are you asking such personal questions has nothing to do with why I am here, my pain Managment doc just left I’m here to see another pain Managment doctor not to be asked personal questions he says oh I work for the state this that and the other.. this place is becoming a joke ..</Text>

<review>This is the most unprofessional doctors office I have EVER been to. I have no idea how they have a 3.9 rateing. They probably are on here rateing themselves or something. I had one decent appointment but since then it has been a nightmare. They don't deserve even 1 star. They told me that they where going to put in a referral for my newborn to see an ears, nose, and throat specialist for a sist on his neck and they told me someone will call me with an appointment for my baby no one called so I called there referral line and they told me that they had not put his referral in over 2 weeks later because they had failed to call me to let me know that I needed to put it under his insurance and not mine because newborns typically go under there mother's insurence the first month. And then I go in there to have it switched the receptionist tells me to come back then on Monday I come in while I'm on the phone with the insurence agent and she tells me to leave because I can't be on the phone even if it is the insurance company< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>I have been dealing with a case of Chronic Acute Sciatica for a couple of years now, and my previous doctors just tried to mask it with otc pain meds. On my initial visit to Elica Health Center, I explained that I want to find the source of the pain and actually FIX that problem. My new care provider (A.W. Nunn, PA) is actually on the same page with me, and we are working through different stages with the goal of getting me out of pain.

Update: It's not just a case of sciatica. I have 3 herniated discs (L4-S1), and am awaiting neurosurgery - Microdiscectomy once my cardiologist clears me. I truly believe I would never have gotten to this point with my previous "care provider".

2/13/2018
I had my back surgery in early December, and am recovering quite nicely. Once again, grateful to have found a provider who listens and treats appropriately.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I had a horrible experience at the midtown clinic. The staff that worked  here was very un professional, rude, and un prepared to say the  least. "Mrs Coleda or Coreda"  was extremely rude and judgemental based off absolutely nothing. The floors were dirty and the exam rooms looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in months. They set appointments 3 weeks out for doctors that don't even work there anymore . With no courtesy  call.There's not even a real doctor working it's only  a MA practitioner who is ghetto and rude makes accusations and isn't willing to listen. (Nurse Coleda or coreda)2 seconds into her intering the room   The nurse/practioner starts acting frustrated and tossing around accusations. Tells us we need to reschedule with a different doctor  cause we asked her why she was being rude when we did nothing and said nothing wrong. A doctor /practioner should be informative and helpful and willing to help people . Not rude,full of attitude and acting like she's gonna get in your face, cause you disagree. Save yourself the time and if you want to be treated as a person regardless of your doctor assumptions don't go here. And if you do and get nurse (coreda coleda) RUN<//review>

<Text>If I can find another facility that takes Medi-Cal & handle my health issues, I would change in a heartbeat. I had routine FUP appt scheduled in Feb. When appt rolled around I was informed that my PCP, Dr. Waterbury, left the practice on Dec 31. So, I had no Dr to see. The office rescheduled for March. At this appt I was told that it was for "initial contact" and my continuing care would not be discussed at that time.  I had additional issues that I needed to discuss and needed prescription refills. Dr. Thao refused to discuss my current problems and I was to make another appt for those. In regards to refills, Dr. Thao just looked at my medication list & immediately reduced/changed without fully looking at my chart. Because of the changes, I have had further health complications.  I also had a form that needed his signature for disability. He flat-out refused to even discuss & I needed to make special "forms" appt, separate from any medical appt. Once "his" time was up, that was it. No issues resolved & I am worse off.  He "had" to move on to next patient.
This practice has no regard for patients, no returned calls and run like an assembly line.
If i could rate zero stars, I would do so.</Text><gmap_id>0x809ad09a76eaf993:0x6f81f6e6291c0d4f< /gmap_id>< rate>

<Text>We had an appointment at Elica Health Center. We checked in 30 Minutes earlier then after waiting too long I asked to see if they have doctor available and said the Doctor she is not available and they rescheduled it for tomorrow in the morning by 9 so tomorrow the same story and  she was not available again.
I never recommend Elica health center to anyone because they suck.
Just waist of time and most of the patients are the refugees who don't know about this health center anything.< /Text>< pics>

Screw this place the wait is ridiculous I showed up 9 minutes late because this place has no parking I drove around for 30 minutes looking for somewhere to park they told me they have a 15 min grace period but they has to reschedule me for 3 hours later because the Dr took the next patient but they make u sit here 3 hours when u are on time it makes no sense this place sucks<//Text>

I took my 2 dogs there for the first time today. We loved it! The staff is so friendly and I love how open everything is... Not like some places where they take your dog to a back room and you never see them. And they did a great job too! Will return as a regular :)< /review>

Patrick is the sweetest groomer. I bring my dog in here once a month to get his nails trimmed. My terrier gets incredibly nervous going to the groomer, and we've tried a few different ones, but he really feels comfortable with Patrick. My pup still gets a little nervous, but he actually allows Patrick to do the job without having an accident or trying to nip him. I believe it's the care and good energy Patrick brings to the work. So grateful to have found this groomer!</review>

<Text>I've been bringing my German Shepherd to bath here in the self wash for roughly 3 years now and it's absolutely wonderful, employees are polite and very helpful!

Bath stations include aprons, towels, shampoo, conditioner, brushes (for a variety of coats), drier (like an industrial hair drier for a dogs coat) cotton balls and swabs, an alcohol solution to clean ears, and an after bath spray that keeps my dog smelling like he's fresh out of the bath for about a week or two.

Keep in mind, if you plan on clipping your dogs nails bring your own clipper!< /Text><Date>1595732942015< /Date>< user_name>

<review>A self wash pod is $15! The shampoo selection is great and you don't need an appointment. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have to wait at all. Super friendly staff. I've been going to The Urban Pet pet store for his other supplies and never knew you could self wash there. I thought they only had full grooming. I'll be going there from now on. It's much easier on  the back than hunching over in a tub. They also have a weekly special for $11 on either Monday or Tuesday.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c74e4976f127:0x620fe77efb5d753d<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
First time using a groomer in the Los Angeles area.  DeeDee at Moonshine was recommended by Stacey, our dog's walker, and DeeDee is great!! My Shi Tsu mix came back looking so handsome and just the right length.  Atticus, a BijPoo, looked so adorable and all fluffed out.  No trauma to the boys and a nifty bandana to boot.  Reasonable pricing as well.  Thank you Moonshine, JoAnne & Ji< /Review>

The wash pods look nice - they have individual gates so your pup doesn’t run out. Unfortunately, when we visited they were out of hot water. They said it was because they had a lot of washes that morning. Seems to me like a dog wash place should have water tanks that are large enough to provide hot water past 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. We ended up going elsewhere rather than wait an undetermined amount of time for hot water to replenish.< /review>

He (and I) were traumatized. Not only was it overly short, it was choppy and down to the skin in sections.

The owner refunded my money and apologized, but I couldn’t recommend the spot to anyone unfortunately. I’m not sure if the same person who gave him the cut still works there anymore, but it was a pretty sad experience. That was May of 2018.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Bennett loves DeeDee. He hates water and runs away when I try give him a bath in my tub.  DeeDee takes so much time with him and makes him feel safe on that special drip stand -- to my surprise he doesn't complain in the bath. She makes sure the water is warm, talks to him and is gentle. She uses the blow dryer at first then switches to another quiet warmer thing for his face. Her brush doesn't hurt. She trims his nails with care and then files them. The bath includes a "privates" shave. He didn't need a haircut this time but she even trimmed around his face a little. I drive from West Hollywood to Silver Lake for his app't and wait to avoid two round trips. She is very accommodating and "we" appreciate her. I don't like going to a groomer that hides the process behind closed doors. I want to see where he is being bathed or kept waiting. I heard so many horror stories that I used to groom him myself (not nearly as well as she does)....I originally came here to use the "pet wash" (also very clean -- great towels and shampoos provided) -- but when I saw how she treated all the "fur clients", I began by having her just clip his nails. She took a lot of time with him (like most dogs, he didn't like it). Now, he knows she doesn't hurt him (and gives treats between paw clips :), so I decided to let her give him the Dee Dee Magic of a complete bath or when needed complete groom. I'm so happy to have found this. It is part of Urban Pet -- I've found that everyone who works here loves animals, is knowledgeable and very helpful. Bennett and his Mom say "Thank you Dee Dee".< /Review>

This was my 1st time coming to the grooming salon, and the service was phenomenal. All the staff, especially our dog Valentine's groomer, treated us so well. I'd recommend them to anyone who wants A1 service. He had his nails trimmed & buffed + we loaded up on organic treats as well. Thank you 🐾 Valentine Drake Walker 🐶 5yo Brindle Pitt</Review>

Website says open till 8pm - they're not. I went in at 7:20pm,  well before 8 and was turned away. Check the time in the top left of my screen shot, then check the business hours posted on their website.
They staff didn't really care, turned me and my dog away and just said sorry - dog wash is closed.

5 Stars for this poke joint!  Found this little poke shop by accident on yelp, called and asked if they were open then decided to stop by -- and we are so glad we did.  Fantastic service and food.  The woman who assisted us was incredibly nice and patient, considering this was our first visit.  She explained their process and offerings, and also made personal suggestions on which sauces pair well together.  By the way, the sesame oil is a game changer!!  Why haven't I had it before?  We each both had a small (2 scoops fish) and were very full and satisfied.  For like $2-3 you can turn your bowl into a combo and they have some interesting drink options.  New favorite place!

They are exercising proper COVID precautions and also do delivery.  Highly recommend!< /text>

One of the best "fast" pokes of the area. The white rice is good, but the fish isn't excellent, and toppings are cheap. Quality of ingredients is average. Prices $8/10/12 for small/medium/large bowl are reasonable, they're generous with the scoops of fish. They offer ceviche now, and sushi burrito.< /text>

<review>I like this spot! They serve first-cleass dishes, their menu is decent, The chef in that place is a real pro, I like very much trying all their food. The food is consistently fresh, the attitude towards the guests  is nice. I often go to  this restaurant and I was never disappointed.  I highly recommend it.<//review><user>113747046781783881240<//user>< Pics>

My favorite Poke place in the area.
The ingredients are consistency good.
They offer daily deals.
The place is clean and bright.

The staff are fun and friendly. I enjoy our conversations every visit.

Objectively, it's not going to do anything special or out of the ordinary, but it's combination of qualities make it my favorite when at work.

I would recommend it to anyone in the area.<//Text>

<Review>The sauces were good and the portions were decent. Parking was easy and I like that they had out door seating. There are specials every day and Yelp check ins offered. I like that there's less waste-they don't waste extra paper on mixing the sauce with the fish. Although it did take me a second to get used to.</Review>< pictures>

Decent poke place but on the expensive side compared to other places. The amount of meat given isn't worth the price for what you get.
Apart from that, the food is good quality and the place is clean. It's just not my top pick for poke but not my last pick.</Text>

Great little hole in the wall poke place. Great selection. Prices range from $8- $12 per bowl. Fish is very fresh. Employees are very welcoming friendly , and patient with your orders.< /review>

I come here pretty often because it's just around the corner from my house. I am a huge fan of poki and I'm really picky about where I go because I like a good quality of fish, as most other people do. This place is pretty consistently fresh and their toppings are some of the best I've encountered around. They have great spam Musubi as well. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a quick bites. Located really close to the gym and the racetrack. Also Costco's just around the corner... stop in and grab a bite before you go wait in the ridiculously long gas line.<//Text>

<Text>Great selection. Your typical poke restaurant. The only difference is that they don't mix you fish together, but put a pretty liberal amount of sauce on your bowl. Also, the have all the sauces available next to the drinks so if you wanted to add more you can.<//Text>< Date>

Great food that's different from your normal lunch choices of burgers, Chinese food, and Mexican.

Good poke bowls with a fair amount of food. A little pricy at $10.50 for a medium. At least it's healthy!< /Text>

One of my favorite lunch stops. It's always nice stopping by. The employees are always polite to take to. The food is always delicious. I can even get my miso or musubi fix here. And if you go here enough, there's a stamp card that can be useful.<//review>

<Review>My wife and I bowl were over sauced and not enough of everything else for the price. $9 for a small bowl and $10 for a bowl that would cost $9 elsewhere for the same amount, perhaps more.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<username>Pete Shieh<//username><time>1470259270935< /time><rating>4<//rating><review>Well, I have to say welcome to Cypress PokiDoki! I love Poke and this place being next to Costco (Ironically they recently offered it prepacked on weekends), would visit here for a healthy alternative anytime!

Their recent Grand Opening had FREE, yes FREE medium size Poke bowls ( reg. 8.50 for 3 items) in which you can pick your base from chips, salad, white rice, or brown rice. Then you pick your proteins from albacore, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallops, eggs. The avocado and imo crabmeat is standard. Extra avo is $1 more. Then you pick your toppings. I just pick all cuz pretty much it's everything I want, including wasabi.  To finish, you pick your sauce. I have to say, I think this place is Korean owned and I'm a little disappointed in the sauce. It's not spicy at all in any way for the spicy version. The regular sauce just tasted like sweet soy sauce.

I noticed on the 2nd day they gave out less on the bowl. I'm not complaining, I'm still grateful to have tried your poke bowl for free and your pokinade which has chunks of strawberry and basil. I do wish the lemon sour intensity was more because it tasted a little watered down for me. But thank goodness you do offer sweet green tea next to the soda dispenser.

I do like the size of the fish chunks here, it's not big nor terribly small. Your servers were friendly with a smile so that in itself was sign for me to come back.

Oh yeah, the blurring loud music when I was there pretty much gave away that the owners were Korean.  If you ever been to those KBBQ places, you know what I'm talking about!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The best baseball park I've been to. Views of the water are amazing. Fun to see home runs go into the water and peeps on kayaks get them! Great variety of good. Had the poke and garlic fries. Great atmosphere!<//Text>

Only reason why it doesn't get a 5 is because during the big rivalry game vs. Cal Poly the bathrooms on the student section side were out and the others were gross.

<text>It's nice to watch the Gauchos play. The security is a little too nit picky, if you ask me. But the staff are generally nice to little kids, and it's great to watch the teeny soccer players scrimmage during the half-time break.</text>< Pics>

Worst Jack in the Box I've ever had the displeasure of visiting. I usually have to wait 20-30 minutes to get my food, 10 on a good day. I keep telling myself it'll be better next time, but it never is. Only gave 2 stars because food is usually hot and pretty fresh.<//Text>

This is my favorite place. Week in and week out we can rely on the food and relax in the restaurant for an hour or more comfortably. In a hurry? No problem, these guys can do fast, even when there's a crowd. That's why so many people are, like me, "Regulars."</Text>

Loooooove Jack in the Box! Love their iced coffees, their fries, their burgers, their tacos! So good. It's VERY busy at every Jack in the Box I've been to, so yes, wait times can get wild. But the food is so worth it, I don't mind. Literally love itttt.</text>

1. I waited in the drive-thru for nearly 20minutes.
2. The fries were warm at best.
3. The bun on my sourdough jack wasn't even toasted.
I keep telling myself "It's going to be good this time" and it never is.</text>

Got our order wrong gave us chicken nuggets instead of jalapeno poppers. Their milkshakes are pretty good but there are way better fast food places in Redding.< /Review>

<review>I always tell myself "it won't be slow this time" but then go through the drive thru and it takes 20-30 minutes. I went last night at 1am, hopeful that because it was late they wouldn't be too busy. There were 2 cars in front of me and I timed how long it took to get through the drive thru. 22 minutes. I've tried going at all different times but I always get the same result. I once waited FOURTY FIVE MINUTES just for them to not give me my drink and give me regular fries instead of curly fries. I rarely will give negative reviews like this, but I'm getting so frustrated.</review>< pics>

I got the Double patty Sourdough combo and it was AWESOME! The sourdough had a nice light crisp on the surface, the meat was perfect and the onions and cheese were great! I loved it so much I ate 3 in two days. I don't recommend doing that as it set me back on my diet a lot but every bite was worth it! Thank you Jack!<//text>

Michael the night manager is very good at his job. He makes sure everything goes as smooth as possible. He has made my food perfectly everytime. Is very accommodating because of my allergies. Thank You Jack in The Box for hiring such a good man there needs to be more people like him in the fast food industry.<//text>

<Text>Very disappointed. Lobby was closed so had to go through drive-thru, no problem.  One car ahead of me, one behind so not busy. Paid for my food a waited. And waited. After 10 minutes girl came to the window and apologized for the delay and asked if I would pull around to the front and she'd bring out my order just as soon as it was finished.  I agreed, thinking they were making fresh batches 14 minutes waiting and she brought my order out and I was on my way. Got home and unpacked the bag to find the burger patties were old and dry, burger was swimming in mustard to the point that you couldn't hold the burger without getting mustard all over and the fries were old, dried out and cold and way oversalted. Total waste of my time and money. They did get the chocolate shake right but I won't be going by there again in the near future<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Do not come here expecting food that is fast, or food that is food even. The best part of my 45 minute ride the the drive thru of dissatisfaction was getting to the window to see a group of dim witted employees giggling at the counter while customers waited nearly an hour for a  order of 15 chicken nuggets and 2 to tacos.

Simply put, just don't.< /Text><Time>1606991620596<//Time>< Rate>

It looked unclean, from the drive-thru window, and the food dident taste as yummy. It was just another fast food place today....you know?? Going to shy away from ole Jack for awhile.</Review><response>{'time': 1611936934434, 'text': "We should be moving a lot quicker than that, Patricia.

They have drive thru only at this time due to the pandemic, which is fine but they are very slow getting orders out thru the drive thru. Had to wait 10 minutes just to get up to the speaker to give my order. Then when I got the order the onion rings where so over cooked that they snapped and the onion itself was completely dried out. I usually enjoy their onion rings but those weren't even edible.< /text>

They got everything right, were a little slow, but were very clean, wore masks, and had a plexiglass divider. Their nuggets are not good, like ever, but the southwest cheeseburger was pretty good. The loaded mini tacos are the exact right kind of indulgent and disgusting. It's drunk food you can eat sober.<//text>

When I told them they had the wrong item on the receipt she asked me if I had told the menu number of the sandwich to her coworker. I told her that I said the name of the sandwich and it was repeated back to me.  We were told to pull over and they would have our food right out. We waited over 15 minutes for them to bring out only the sandwich they corrected,  not the other 3 meals. We had already paid and were hungry so we had to wait even longer for them to bring us the rest of our food!

<text>Driving a semi truck as an essential worker walked over to Jack in the box to get some breakfast and they wouldn't serve us because we couldn't go through the drive-thru. They could have just easily walked out and taken our order but instead they let us walk away. Jack in the box not just this one doesn't seem to want to help people out during the Covid 19. This is not my first problem with Jack in the box but it will certainly be my last. Thankfully the guys at AMPM next door were amazing. what a disgrace Jack in the box. I see why you only have two and a half stars. When I worked in fast food I would have never let a customer walk away. I would have figured out a way to help them out.</text>< pictures>

I eat here pretty often because its not only close to my home but the food is great and the customer service is really good also. The drive through gets a little long at times but its worth it for good food. I order the loaded breakfast sandwhich with mayo almost everytime now. Its become my favorite on the menu. Everyone should try it if u love breakfast foods. I would recommend eating here.<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Just went through the drive thru. I didn't get my full order and my sourdough jack was cold. I called to fix this mistake and they told me I could get the rest of my order next time and even after asking them to make up for the extra gas and time I have to spend to get what I already paid for they refused. Complete disappointed and upset that I'm not being treated right, yet they had no problem taking $25 from me. Not to mention the fact that I'm taking extra risk cause of the covid-19 and now I have to do it again. Jack in the box is not supportive of people or anyone dealing with this deadly virus.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Good food for fast food. As a family of 5 we can never get out of there for under $40. On the slow side too, but always have nice people working. It's super annoying, but make sure you have your ID if you order more than $25 using a card in drive through!<//Text>

<Review>This place put 5 nail clippings in my nacho taco and they didn't give my money back when I brought them the taco with all the nail clippings that I pulled out of my mouth from a bite. This place is trash because of this. And by no means is this a false story I have pictures to prove this absolute messed situation.
I will never eat at a jack in the box for the end of time. Because this ruined me buying the cheapest tacos ever< /Review><date>1540595884352<//date>< user_id>

NOPE what I got was a flour tortilla with 3 pieces of meat, that was it! Where the hell did the potatoes and cheese go... Not in my burrito, I can say that.

Usually out of rice at night. Fast and good for location but inside is never easy kept clean when I have been there. Parking lot not well lit. The food is hot and staff is friendly. Menu changes and the drive thru is fast service.</Text>

It's hit and miss. Drive thru time is usually not bad. Food is sometimes really good. And other times not. But overall it's fast food. What more could I say?< /Text>

Most terrible experience I've EVER had at a Jack in the box!! I've been all around the country and I've never been so disgusted with they're food. They gave me cold food, burnt fries (they were black) I can't believe I was served this disgusting food. They had me park in front for they're sake of the timer not going off for they're benefit. They didn't give me any ketchup or hot sauce or even napkins! Plus the work place was a disaster! I had to walk in to get my food because it took 15+ mins!</text>

<review>Ive ordered 3 burgers from here on 3 occasions. All of them were terrible.
The first- patty was BURNT
Second - patty was COLD
Third - The cheese was STALE
Steer clear if you want fast food go to Carl's Jr. Their burgers are comparatively priced, but much higher quality and service.</review>< pictures>

Long wait in lobby. Not just the first time, but every time to date.  Drive thru is faster.  Always short handed and inside facility is always in disarray. Always food on the floor. I even witnessed an employee scrape food off the bottom of their shoe. 🍟< /text>
