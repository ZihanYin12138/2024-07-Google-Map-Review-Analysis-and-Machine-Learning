<Text>They had us wait while they made a couple new batches of food i selected. They gave us both free drinks while we waited. The food was good and it was hot. I would eat here again especially since it was much better than the El Cajon one is.<//Text>< pics>

<review>My son and I really love Panda Express. One new change that bugs me is that they are hoarding there teriyaki sauce. One of there locations would not give me any unless I ordered the plat that came with it. This place when you ask in the drive through they often short change you on the packets and sometimes don't give you them at all (even though they said ok when I asked). My son and I like our noodle's and rice wet so we dump a packet of teriyaki on it (yummmm). If it was not for the hassle with the sauce packets its a 5 star place.

Their drive through is scary fast, sometimes I wonder how it got the food bagged up so fast when I drove just 20 feet from the order station to the pay station.< /review>< pics>

<text>They gave me the last old and of the rice and I asked repeatedly renew fried rice. She said they did they never did when I got home I was upset. Also I asked for the stakes I received the steak but it wasn't there then I only have three pieces in it and all that stuff. Everything to orange chicken with spine the broccoli and beef was okay I have more beef than the steak at least I had four or five pieces LOL. I always go there every 2-3 days and I'm very disappointed very. Also we ask for Chinese fortune cookies for a dollar something and she gives me 3 in the bag and that's it. I know it is as bad a year that we pay we should get the quality thank you for asking. Maybe me and my children my two twins will have a better time another day one day.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dbf4bd743c437b:0x3554f3076d857200<//Gmap_id>< pics>

This experience was different. Extremely friendly personnel. Very forthcoming.

Even their manager and the boss asked if everything is to my liking and when the empty soda cup fell on the floor while handing it over, the manager immediately gave me a new one.

I was impressed.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Short version : Very poor food quality(later hours at least)

I went there at around 9:50 PM, got some orange chicken, mushroom chicken and Chow mein. Was so hungry that I had the entree of orange chicken in the parking lot. The smell, or should I say fumes, from it made me cough. After my coughing fit was done (not ashmatic) I ate a piece to find that it tasted a lot like McDonald's chicken mcnuggets. Chow mein was dry and flavorless. Would get my money back, but I already drove home, hoping the entree was just a fluke. It wasn't. Definitely do not recommend, at least not in the later hours. Can't say for mid day. (On a side note, when I got home, I opened the tray to find the spot for the mushroom chicken was completely empty, almost clean. The entree was just with the noodles...
Panda Express, if you read this, I would very greatly appreciate a refund, or at the very least a replacement meal of decent quality. Thank you for reading.< /Review>

Big let down as Panda Express was a place I really enjoyed. The best thing about this place was the service and cleanliness, which earns it two stars. The food however, needs work. Perhaps it was because I was there in the evening, but still it was pretty bad. I was craving the walnut shrimp for weeks. I was already irked that the server said there was a 7 shrimp count per serving (although not her fault I suppose, just following management orders). I ordered a double portion for my wife and I just to make sure there was enough. I counted them when I got home out of curiosity. They shorted me two and threw in a few broken walnuts. Considering they up charged me $1.75 extra for ordering shrimp I expect better. To top it off the shrimp batter was stale lacking glaze. Again, maybe it was the end of the day syndrome or just a bad location but I will unfortunately not be going to PE for a while. Too many options in the area.<//Text>

<Review>Last time I went here they were helping the people behind me and in front of me and never asked if they could help me. I finally just left. So today I decided to try it since it had been over a year and I was starving. I went inside and ordered two sides of entrees, one being Teriyaki Chicken. I asked the girl, because she never asked me if I wanted the sauce on the entrée or on the side, did she put the sauce on the chicken. She replied, "No on the side." So I get home and no sauce. I now have a side of chicken, no teriyaki. They asked if I wanted a drink, wanted to donate my change, wanted anything else. Maybe they should concentrate on what I did ask for and want, how hard is that? Never again at this location.<//Review>< response>

So I ordered a two entree plate got instead a bowl I had to get out of the car to go and ask to get what I ordered. A manager came (was so tired didn't even ask her name) told her I wanted my 2 entree plate with an order of spring rolls as one of my entrees. She said it was the same thing getting a bowl with the spring rolls on the side. She didn't want to give me what I paid for everyone knows that the portion of a bowl to a plate is different as it reflects on the price... I didn't feel like arguing so I just let it go but I will go back and get what I paid for.</Text>

All locations are good. At least this one has a drive thru which is nice. The only thing is angle of the drive thru. It’s really just meant for 2 cars at a time. When the line is long, cars block the others entering the parking lot. Other than that, we are good!</Review>

Food was fresh 👌 good service and on the way out in the parking lot the girl said have a great day with a smile , I found that refreshing...the manager is doing a good job training his/her staff.

<Review>We have tried different Panda Express in our area. This one is the best! Why? Because if you are eating in the restaurant, they plate your food on a paper plate. Not a styrofoam container. What a nice concept!
We orded the pepper chicken, shrimp, stir wok veggies, orange chicken, noodles, brown rice. All delicious!</Review>< Name>

The lady that helped me had a smile on her face the whole time and the food was delicious. They always try to inform you on the best deals when it comes to your meal. It will ask you over and over are you sure it's much cheaper if you get this or that even if you just want something single ala cart. It does tend to get a little bothersome while there sometimes when you know what you want and they try and bargain with you to get more to pay less but it still is really good of them that they try to to make their customers pay less for what there. however the food was good and delicious</review>

Mann do i love the sugar chicken and the best teriyaki every day filling my insides full of juicy delicious things to fill me mouth, oh so wet and juicy when they go down the throat and down in the tummy like nut does in my girlfriend, and great public bathroom to get in the toilet and get into who you want in enough time and to leave the sink on so no-one hears anything but cooking and amazing Chinese food while a girl takes a kabob to the neck or smometimes far enough south to reach her stomach, what an acquired place to get it on and eat right after without cleaning up is amazing. Along with the public bathroom please do not wipethe toilet walls soap sink and floors to keep all of the juices to make into the most amazing food of panda express💕 one love and thanks again for the beautiful bathroom🚻</review>

Great food as always, the woman who helped us was a little rude though.

Decent restrooms but you have to be buzzed in.  There is no code despite the key pad.

This area has a very large number of homeless people hanging about (probably why the bathrooms are locked) but they don’t bother anyone, just sort of dirty looking.< /review>

<text>It was just okay.  It was my first time there and I was getting the food for free.  I got a steak and mushroom bowl.  I asked for chow mein and they told me I had to wait for the food to cook.  I was okay with it since it would be fresh.  Well, they brought it out after about 15 mins and it was on rice instead of noodles...  I was disappointed.  Then instead of making it again they just brought out a tub of noodles on the side.  I won't be going there again.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I was offered a sample.... then,  the
mgr. disappeared, the story below;
While appearing friendly, the "show" was perfunctory.... the girl rushed me through ordering food even though I said I hadn't been there in awhile and was going through menu choices.  The register girl couldn't be bothered to listen to me as I said I wanted a small beverage then,  asked ME if I WANTED a small beverage..... not impressed and didn't feel welcomed. This place sucks.</text>

<review>They couldn't serve any food until 20 minutes after they opened because the manager was late to work. She was the only one that knew how to use the cash register. So the two othwr employees that were on time just stood around.< /review>< Pics>

This location has a drive thru.  Although convienent, the best service and quality is going inside.  I always get more food inside, than through drive thru.  Also, the service is quicker.  The ladies working inside appear nicer than at drive thru.< /text>

<Review>Unfortunately they do not compromise or accommodate their customers even if they were allergic to a specific item like onions they will not accommodate you so therefore I find that to commercial  And they are not concerned about their customers I even called the corporation and there were  More adamant that they are not going to alter or minus any specific item for you so I guess I personally would not go there again And that's how I solved my problem<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>I buy a Beijing bowl. And I received 4 pieces of beef 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Jack and the box across the street for the same price. Gives me a drink and an egg roll. Plus you didn't give me any soy sauces in my bag? Then ask me to donate the rest of my change to a cause? Maybe I need charity for my bowl poor 4 pieces beef.....

UPDATE: IF YOU DONT GIVE THE REST OF YOUR CHANGE TO CHARITY THEY DONT GIVE YOU SOY SAUCE. Napkins or fork in the drive through!</review>< Resp>

<Review>Been here many times since it's just around the corner from my work, everytime I come here there is something wrong with my order. Whether it's ordering a chicken egg roll with NO sweet and sour, then getting sweet and sour and NO egg roll to opening my food and finding double orange chicken when I asked for half orange half Beijing beef.

This is a fast food restaurant I don't expect much but can you atleast give us what we are PAYING/asking for?!?

It's not like it's hard to LISTEN to an order.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

This place always runs out of food by 930pm....but I think they just don't want customers after certain hours.</Review>

<Review>The one star is for the Asian face short haired lady in black shirt. I guess she's supervisor or manager. I asked for a kids meal, she told me only 4 shrimps would be given. I said it was ok but she kept convincing me getting normal combo. Ok, i get it. So I switched shrimp to veggie mix and asked her just add another entree shrimp. And again she kept saying its not worth it cos it's only 7 shrimps would be given. I'm not first time shopper don't need your suggestions, which actually annoyed me a lot cos her unclear speaking and poor communication skill. Just give me one kids meal and one walnut shrimp entree. That's it! She still didn't follow and blah blah blah....until i asked her for just a kids meal no more shrimp. She was very unhappy and went in a corner nobody could see her to get the shrimps out from the box then came out to scooped the veggie mix. After i paid by my card, i found out i was overcharged 1.95 by one extra item which was spring roll. I never like nor ordered spring roll in my whole life here. I told cashier right away and she was confused too. She asked for the asian lady to come fix it, and the asian lady took my card away to her office for a while, then came back and told me she refunded me already. I asked her how? Where is receipt? She said i need trust her and no receipt for that. And she said it's only 2 dollars anyway with a very disgusting fake smile! No apology at all. she's the worst manager I've ever seen in Panda Express! I checked my bank no refund so far so I posted here. And i doubt if she did anything wrong on my credit card too as she kept it for quite a while in her secret spot! Don't let her serve you at any cost or you better watch out for the bill!
Forgot to mention there was only one customer ahead of me, but both of us kept waiting for 10 mins cos no one came up to us at a not busy time. Bad management!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>According to the pictures, we ordered the
Manhattan  garlic chicken Pizza at 650pm. We picked up the pizza and couldn't get out of the parking lot of without having a  slice or two. The pizza crust is wonderful. Crust, yes I said crust is awesome.
We will definitely be back.< /text>< pictures>

Fresh ingredients, service was good. My only complaint was the quality and flavor of the crust which tasted like prefab store bought. The pizza was large - which is good -  but you pay for it.< /review>

I can’t give anything but a 5+ star rating. To begin, the staff was extremely professional and nice. Very pleased with the service. We ordered the bbq wings and loved them! We ordered an Italian Meat Lovers pizza. It was soooooooooo good!!! The crust is so good not to mention the cheese and toppings!!! Superb! Also, the owner came out and asked if we would like to try their soup of the day (clam chowder). I said yes because I LOVE clam chowder and grew up on the coast.... needless to say, it was delish!
So I definitely recommend this place to everyone! Family oriented as well, with some games in the back. Bathrooms were clean also!<//review>

My experience with customer service was not bad. My experience with the food, well I had it two times the first time the Gyro 🥙 was sooo good it was just like NY but the second time the Gyro was so messy and different idk what they did different but they ruined the flavor I believe it has something to do with the onions. Now for the pizza I was so disappointed both times it was stale and sorry it wasn’t good at all no where near NY Pizza, people FYI the pizza doesn’t taste like NY pizza at all.</text>

BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD MY GUY!!! Where to begin... So there I was, minding my own business, lookin fly AF, cruisin' down W El Monte Way in Dinuba, you know...goin hard in the paint in my 98 kia Rio right... when this new restaurant sign caught my eye! Ayooo this New York Pizza joint be slammin yo!! Right off the bat, we got greeted, with the most amazing customer service this Cat ever seen! Jas at the cash register was phenomenal.  I was like.."bruh,  you makin me feel like the president of the United States...I feel like Rico Suave at the VMA's or Drake dropping a new hit single. The Wings were nothing less then perfect, tasted so good and a generous amount for what I paid. It tasted so good I thought I died and went to chicken kang heaven..mmm these drumsticks be wylin yo! (my mouth still waterin thinkin bout em right now brah). So that pizza right..soon as I took the first slice, my taste buds got hit with a 2×4 of: made from scratch, fresh, deliciousness. My taste buds  instantly transported me to New York exactly how the east coast does it. Jas and Jezlyne creating this heavenly pizza was comparable to that of Michaelangelo di Lodovico created the Sistine Chapel. I recommend this place to everyone in the tri-county area...no better yet I recommend this to all people confined in the greater state of California!! Dinuba Holla at ya Best in town Pizza!< /review>

I hired Kim to do a photoshoot for one of my web design clients and she did an absolutely fantastic job.

Her professionalism and creativity was a definite bonus.

I look forward to working with her again and would recommend her to anyone looking for a professional, friendly and creative photographer.

Defintely 5 stars.< /text>

Kim did a much needed head shot portrait for me and I can't be more happier with the outcome. She was patient and thorough and incredibly professional. I'm so excited to have this professional portrait and to have someone that I can call and schedule all of my portrait needs. The icing on the cake was that she is also very affordable.

I have had the pleasure of working with Kim several times over the past few years and have used her to photograph our business properties.  Kim is hands down the best photographer we have used.  She is professional, knowledgeable, has wonderful communication and always provides a quick turnaround.  She overdelivers every time and I highly recommend her for any job!< /Review>

<Review>Kim has never let me down.

Kim is the ultimate professional photographer.  She has the ability to zone in on what the client's needs are and helps them interpret that need into a picture that captures what the client wants to represent.  In addition, she takes great care at focusing in on the clients preferences for style and representation.  It is not often that a photographer gives you options on editing preferences and the reasons behind it.  This is only one of the many reasons I would highly recommend utilizing Kim's skillful ability to capture whatever subject in the best light.  Her experience and knowledge in the area of photography is amazing.  I will definitely use and recommend her again for my photography needs.<//Text>

Kim Oliver made our business shine.  She has a great eye for detail and The Village Veterinary Hospital has flourished with the addition of this video tour.  Kim was able to show off our state of the art features that our new office has to offer.  I would recommend her services to everyone.  This is a great way to advertise your business and Kim adds that special something in the way she sets up her shots.  The video really flows.  I couldn't be more pleased by her work.</Review>

Kim Oliver did a fantastic job creating the virtual tour! The image quality was eye-popping. I couldn't believe how good she made our stores look. She helped us get the stores to look just right. She even helped us embed the See Inside on our website. And she was a complete professional. I would highly recommend Oliver's Captured Moments to anyone looking for this kind of service.< /Text>< Pictures>

Not only is Kim Oliver amazing at what she does, it is evident that she really cares about helping her clients (and anyone she meets!) in any way that she can. It's not just about making money for her. You know right when you meet her that she has a real passion for helping people succeed in their business.

Kim has helped my business in so many ways! She did our virtual tour, she took my portraits and has coached me with marketing. She is professional, caring and extremely good at what she does.

I have always HATED having my photo taken and told Kim that I was honestly dreading our session together. I had literal anxiety and the morning of just wanted to cancel. She assured me it would be no big deal and was obviously up for the challenge of making me feel comfortable in front of the camera. She did exactly that! She guided me through the process and made me feel like we were just hanging out. I didn't feel any pressure I would normally feel in front of a camera. And!!! I actually liked how I looked in the photos! She did an incredible job!

I am so grateful for everything Kim has done for me and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to utilize ANY of her services.</Review>

<text>Not only is Kim Oliver an exceptional photographer, she’s an exceptional person.  Her photography is second to none, but it’s her kind, genuine, calm and caring demeanor that sets her above the competition.  Kim took our recent family Christmas photos and did a stellar job.  It’s not easy to capture great shots with an infant and a dog involved, but Kim made it seem easy.  She made what could very easily be a stressful situation, a fun and easy experience.  Kim is truly talented and great at what she does.  In addition to our family photos, Kim has also taken 360 degree views of several of our businesses.  She always exceeds our expectations with her attention to detail and captures everything perfectly.  I highly recommend Kim’s photography services!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Kim Oliver is a talented and very professional photographer. She listens closely to the needs of the clients and does her utmost to fulfill or exceed them. I've found her to be consistently on time, or early, with both her appointments and with the finished photos, and very cooperative with any changes in schedule that I've requested. Kim is the photographer that I've been searching for as a Realtor - now the houses I list get the best possible photos!</review>

As you may know, Google has a selected number of "trusted photographers" for handing your Business View.  You can't just do it yourself.  I logged onto their page, and found a few options.  The first person I wrote did not even give me the courtesy of a reply.

Kim on the other hand was quick to reply, and scheduled for my convenience. She was prompt, prepared, and had some great ideas in both presentation and saving me some  money.

Her finished product was as professional as her approach.  Very happy with the end result, and can easily recommend.

We used her a second time, and same quality experience.

She email me details the day we scheduled the shoot, Therefore, I knew what to expect. On the day of the shoot,  we were done in 15 minutes, and my photo came out great!</Review>< Time>

After watching Kim's work for clients, we had her take a family portrait with our new dog. The dog is a Sheppard, about 1 year old, very strong and very active. Kim did a great job of managing the shoot to get a great shot of us and our dog</Review>

I just updated my photo with Kim Oliver at Captured Moments in Gold River. She did a fantastic job. She also did my daughter's graduation pictures. She took her time to get just the right shots.</Review>

<Text>Sacramento Children's Museum had a great experience with Oliver's Captured Moments. Kim walked us through the process step by step and made the photo shoot easy.  The results are wonderful and we will use them again and again. This is a great way to give the public an idea of what our Museum looks like on the inside and out.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Kim came to my home to photograph me outside. Even though it was over 100 degrees, she was cool and calm, never impatient. I couldn't be happier with my new professional head shot. I highly recommend Kim for any professional photo needs.<//Text>

Kim did a Fantastic job in photographing and making a tour of my office on Google.
I am pretty fussy and have a keen eye for the way I want things to look.
Kim took into account my concerns and used her artiste's eye to present my firm in
exactly the manner I wanted.

She talked to us beforehand, informed us of her suggestions and mostly took a lot of time and effort to make sure it was perfect. And it was!

Highly Recommended.</review>

<Text>As the GM for Maita Honda, I asked Kim to do our "see inside" tour.  She did an outstanding job.  She assisted us in our prep, showed up early for the shoot to do a walk-through, and her photography and tour turned out excellent.  We plan to use her services again at our other dealerships. Take a look at our tour and you'll see her exceptional quality of work. Thanks Kim!<//Text>< Pictures>

I used to hate getting my headshot done. The one you currently see in my Google profile was one I had done over 15 years ago when I started my business. Every headshot since was not as good because my eyes tend to disappear when I smile. Kim was able to capture my new headshot in less than a dozen tries and I think I look better than I did 15 years ago! A miracle? I'll say! Her suggestions and "eye" let me put my best face forward!<//Review>

<Review>This is a great barbershop hands down. The professionalism and commitment to making sure you are happy with your haircut speaks for itself . I finally landed a amazing barber by the name of Johnny who was working in a local barbershop here in Tracy. He had the dream of opening his own shop and he made it happen alone with other partners naming it Next Level Cuts. Not only do they have great barbers at Next Level Cuts, it’s a place where you can see what a vision looks like.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Sorry gotta rate them 1 star. Walked in 1 1/2 before they closed to get my son a hair cut and there were two guys there. Neither one of them wanted to cut his hair. They said they were done for the day. I asked one of the guys if they are open tomorrow (Sunday) and he said not sure let me give you a card so you can call. He apologized and said sorry I’m just to swooped to do another cut. What a way to do business.</text>

JR is a skilled barber. I'll definitely be coming back. I just moved to Tracy and needed a cut since it's been almost 3 to 4 months since my last cut. I didnt make any appt, I just walked in to see how this place was and I was shocked. The shop was super clean and the barbers were very professional. Also they have AC and it felt hella good inside the shop. Another 5 stars for that.</text>

Very nice atmosphere very very welcoming usually I go to barbershops and are very uncomfortable here is just different it's a cute little shop on 10th. They all do great jobs on the customer but my favorite is Don.... If you want and need a nice clean cut I say this is the spot. Oh yeah Don is wonderful with kids every single time my son gets cut by him he doesn't have any deep cuts from a barber not knowing how to deal with kids..... Tell Don Jozy sent you 😉😉<//text>

They did not even try to do my hair saying they were "Exhausted" from doing too many haircuts for other people than me.< /Text>

I drive 2 hours to see these cats.  Haven't found anyone that got the hands they got over here, and I'm very particular with my cuts.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.<//Text>

Open seating and even at 10pm when the Warriors was playing a game, there were plenty of seats. The service is great too - then again, I was with someone older and looked more distinguished probably.<//review>

There are open ping pong tables in the back near all of the other games, if you just wanna come and have a couple of drinks and don't mind the wait with others then I definitely recommend the open table in the back!< /Text>

The Mercury lounge is awesome! Eclectic vibe. Cozy retro living room feel inside and jungle on the back patio.
The beer, wine etc selection is always amazing and you always have a great bartender to help you find what you're into.
keep rocking!

Bar has an amazing selection of different beers. Even if something isn't on the drinks menu, ask, good chance they have it in bottle. Free popcorn. Pool is 50¢? A dollar? Back outdoor cozy covered patio with tables chairs couches. Easy to park. I mean what more can you ask for?< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Best neighborhood bar in all of Goleta & SB!!!! It is decorated super cute & retro. They have the best live music AND the best bar background music!!!! The bartenders are really personable & sweet and the owners especially are FANTASTIC!!!!! Best authentic bar spot. I LOVE it here!!!! And, the bathroom's are really cute. There is a pool table but it is not available on live music nights which is fine amd an assortment of bar/board games. This is where the real locals go, not the tourists. Love this place!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This place is a throwback. So deco. Craft beer and wine only. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and customers. A beautiful outside covered patio where you can smoke (if that's ur thing). Complimentary popcorn (just ask). Love this "dive".<//text>

Casual, friendly, retro-50's-to-60's bar, in Old--town Goleta. Generous selection of craft beers. If you prefer a "hoppy" brew, or double-chocolate stout, the barkeeps will steer you right. Also, a nice selection of wines; I tried a delicious "bubbly Rose`", that rivalled good "Champagnes". Outside seating area that allows smoking. A fun, eclectic mix of weekly  live music, as well!<//text>

<Review>Perfect dive bar/lounge if that's what you're looking for! Dark, looks smokey even with no one smoking. Wish they had a few more beers on tap, but what they have is good.</Review>< rate>

I love this place. Supper relaxing, kitschy mid century vibe and FREE POPCORN. Great selection of craft beer on tap and lots of weirder stuff and ciders in cans. They have a really nice garden/patio area in back where you can smoke. This is my favorite bar by far.<//Review>

<text>Nice and intimate ale house. Great selection of beer and wine and super friendly staff. My only complaint would be they have no hard alcohol so if in the mood for a stiff drink there is no option but I was able to find plenty of tasty beer so it was really a non issue.

Highly recommend.< /text>< pictures>

So so so glad they got rid of the doorknob covered with duct tape. The live music every Friday and Saturday night is pretty annoying usually. Seems like a good idea to put band nights on Thursdays and sundays or something, not the already peak hours of Friday and Saturday. I love live music but have passed it up many times on weekend nights for having to pay a cover and not being able to have a conversation over some band that is not that interesting.</text>

<Review>Very disappointed--I liked this place until I had an incident on a Friday night. Personally, I (a white woman) had decent service, but my almost of my friends of colour found themselves waiting exceedingly long times, having their questions answered very curtly, and generally being treated very dismissively.  It may be worth noting that all of my party are extremely polite PhD students.  Very disappointed and will not be returning.<//Review>< pics>

Its small, not a good place to relax. Good place to find drugs,prostitution and creepy people.
I thinks its a half star.

Could do better if it was fixed up .</review>

Not sure if we picked the wrong day or what, but the mood and atmosphere of the place was quite depressing. Also it was so dark you could barely see the person in front of you. The whole experience felt like trying to cheer up a place by just making the music louder.<//text>

More of a young professional / grad student hangout. Great for those that want to be away from the crazy college crowds. Beer is a little expensive but the atmosphere makes it worth it. There is a semi hidden outdoor area in the back.< /Review>

<Text>How do you describe this funky and rad Old Town Goleta favorite?  It's like the best beer tasting you've been too at the most perfect venue you can imagine. Okay, maybe that's a bit much, but it is by far my favorite Goleta watering hole. They have about 10 amazing beers on tap that rotate often.  They have over 30 eclectic bottles to choose from.  The service is top notch and the tenders are crazy knowledgeable about the varieties.  The seating is plentiful and for the longer days - make sure to sit in their outside Oasis (at the back).  Not the cheapest, BUT totally worth it!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The lady there is crazy never met anyone with such a nasty approach to people there's far greater bars than this one for example imperial lounge better patio and crazy friendly bartenders minus the pool table but if you want to play pool there's breaktime.

All in all, the Mercury Lounge is a really cozy bar with incredibly soft furniture you can melt into. I love the vibes and unique decor that keeps your eyes traveling around the room.

<Text>On 3/6/21 @ 2:00pm I went to 1-800-Flowers/Conroys Flowers. I asked one of the 2 ladies for help in looking for a sympathy arrangement. “Sophie/Sophia” was the lady I spoke to. She quickly told me to just walk around and look at the arrangements they have. As I walked around looking, nothing appealed to me as there wasn’t much of a selection & the limited selection they had was wilted, dry or looked bare. I went back to the front, spoke to “Sophie/Sophia” again....asking her if there were any other arrangements I could look at. She told me I can look online, then show her, but the arrangement wouldn’t get made today because all of the “designers” have already gone home for the day.  (Saturday hours are 9am - 7pm)
I said “Thank you” & left. Very disappointed ...unprofessional & unhelpful.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>I went in on Sunday afternoon needing an arrangement for a Memorial service and these 2 ladies (sorry I didn't get their names) were so accommodating!  They were so nice, friendly and helpful!  They helped me pick out the perfect arrangement and we even added some things to it, to make it even better.  The tin pot, it was in, was so perfect!  It said, "Peace", on it and had a picture of a white dove so we placed a stick with a white dove, on top, sticking out of the arrangement.  The customer service was top-notch and the prices were great as well!  I definitely recommend you stop in, if you are ever in need of a quick plant or floral arrangement.<//text>< pictures>

I  literally  live right next to their business. They don't seem to care call them up to tell them that my wife was about to leave and they   seems like whatever,  I don't think I would be going back to them wich sucks cause out hear no one has good fresh flowers. They were decent.. all dying because they took them in a hot van all over town.

My husband purchased an arrangement for my birthday, picked them up the day before(7/2), placed them in the fridge outside to surprise me when I awoke the next morning(7/3). There were wilted rosebuds, the filler is already dropping  on the table and today (7/4), it looks like a cheap bouquet  of fillers from Walmart. Beyond disappointed in the quality, especially considering the amount  of money he spent and his thoughtfulness.<//review>

<Review>Bought a bouquet of roses for my girlfriend. Noticed some roses were starting to get wilted when I got to the car. Walked back inside and mentioned it to the staff. They exchanged the dry looking roses. Less than a week later they’re wilted. My experience with flowers has been they typically last longer than a few days... these were pricey so I wish they lasted longer than they did.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

Ordered flower delivery for mothers day four days prior and received email confirmation.  Conroy's called me two days later stating they were too busy and asked to deliver the day before mothers day.  As the recipients were out of town Saturday, I told them that wouldn't work and they assured me the flowers would be delivered as promised.  They delivered Saturday regardless.  They've lost my businesa.< /review>

Promised and paid for "SAME DAY SERVICE" threw 1800flowers.
Anticipating a joyful call from mom to say she received the flowers I sent...
Had I not followed up, would anyone let me know?
Having to blow "the surprise" >>
A day and half later, several phone calls and much time on hold...
Jenna with "lots of attitude" called Mom saying "We don't go on dirt roads, why don't you come pick them up?"  How UNPROFESSIONAL!! Mom says "are you kidding me, this was supposed to be a surprise delivery of flowers to me from my daughter in Chicago!"
Not to mention lying to 1800flowers saying you attempted to deliver..after telling mom you didn't bother, due to the dirt road.
By the way mom is 2 doors down from ASFALT. Then you/your shop should NOT have taken the order.
If Jenna would have been kind or apologetic this review would have been different.
Tone and professionalism goes a long way. The fact that you will not deliver to dirt road is not the issue, it's the way you spoke to mom and wasted our time.<//review>

We have been ordering arrangements for as long as Conroy's has been here and they have always been lovely.  Whether they were locally delivered or ordered for family out of state, all were impressed by their arrangements.  I recently ordered a graduation arrangement via phone, the staff member was so very helpful and polite.  I told her what my graduate liked and she helped me find the perfect arrangement; it was delivered the same day and the young lady was ecstatic. I can't say enough good things about Conroy's because we have had great experiences.<//review>

I came here today looking for baby's breath for my best friend's bridal  shower. The girl that helped me, Crystal, was wonderful. She showed me how to cut them down and put them into the mason jars. She even let me know that if I needed more to just let her know in advance and she'd order the bunches for me. I'll definitely be coming back.</text>

Long story short I placed an order for delivery and was received in great condition. Then a couple days later a few roses began to die. So I called them up and without hesitation they told me to bring them in and they would have a fresh bouquet ready for me. All in all I had a great encounter with 1800 flowers and would definitely recommend them.<//Review>

My sister in law had her flowers made by Conroy's Flowers for her wedding. I've been in 5 weddings and these were the prettiest bouquets yet. Our dresses were in different shades of coral and I didn't know how they were going to pull it off, but they did. I just got engaged and I've already booked my appointment with Crystal to discuss my wedding.</review>

I ordered flowers and received confirmation that they were delivered. However, thu we’re not delivered. Customer service was rude and wanted to issue me a $20 credit towards my next order. There won’t be a next order.<//Text>

<review>I have been using this florist for years for work and personal. I tried to order a corsage over 2 weeks in advance and the woman that answered the phone said she was told not to take any more corsage orders for the entire month. I was shocked. Then she laughed and hung up on me. I will not be using their services again<//review>< username>

Worst service ever. Was given a guarantee delivery time before 2pm and flower were delivered at 230pm after she had left work. Second issue was the arrangement was supposed be an All-around arrangement with white roses, carnations, and Peruvian lilies (alstroemeria); blue delphinium; baby’s breath; seeded eucalyptus, and assorted greenery. What she got was 3 white roses and a vase full of carnations. Nice to know I paid $80 for carnations. I will never do business with 1800 flowers again.<//Text>

Ordered online for a family member. Luckily, I was there when the flowers were delivered. They sent the wrong arrangement. Then waited all day the next day to have the correct arrangement delivered. It had the correct flowers this time, however it was the a terrible job. It looks like the person didn't know what they were doing. There are gaps in the flowers. I would not recommend this shop.<//text>

It was very disappointing.  The flower arrangements were ugly and with very few flowers.  Too expensive for so little flowers. They ended up suggesting I could do my own arrangements. I did and ended up paying $43.00 (base included) with very few flowers.  Two weeks ago I had gotten a beautiful bouquet with much more flowers from Stater Bros. for just $21.00.  It's just that everything in the high desert is so far apart I could not get to Stater Bros. in time to visit my friend. Do not go to this place. It is a rip off.< /Text>

I will start off by saying I worked here awhile back. It was the most unpleasant experience I've had. I genuinely enjoyed working with my co-workers except for Crystal. She's the manager there. Upon the first few days of me working there the whole time she was training me she made me feel like if I was a complete idiot. Don't let her outer appearance fool you - even though she likes to come across always smiling happy -go attitude in reality she's a mean evil cold hearted woman. She has this wall where if you make a mistake on a order she'll dribble little notes like how teachers used to write when you failed your math test and she'll post it in the wall of shame. She also has about 50 tasks that you're supposed to complete AND you have have to sign it off with your initials everyday. I mean who does that? Only Crystal.  Soooo many girls have applied there and gotten the job and have quit shortly because of her. Then she wonders why this job is a huge turn over. I would not recommend for anyone to apply here unless if you like being belittle and ridiculed for every little mistake you do then go for it. When I quit it was literally the happiest last day working at Conroys. I hated working there. The owners seriously need to look at their management.<//review>

I was just in a wedding and my friend ordered the flowers from Conroys. They were the prettiest I have ever seen. Crystal went above and beyond to make sure my friend had nothing to worry about. She helped with the center pieces, pinned the flowers on the guys and helped us bridesmaids with any last minute touches. You know people are always quick to judge on the negative but people should share the positive experiences too. It doesn't take that long to post a positive comment. I work in customer service too and I know when people don't get their way they will throw out negativity. I will be referring Crystal and her store Conroys to my friends. Thank you again.< /review>

Bought roses and a bear for my wife, got roses from a recycled batch and a teddy bear that looked sad, like he had got into a fight with a dog before arriving at my door. Called Conroys for help, they said call 1-800 flowers, and been waiting for someone to answer for over an hour. Now my Valentine's Day has been spent trying to contact them. So no date, no dinner, no movie, and now no smile like they promised as advertised. I have learned my lesson. No more surprises for my wife, I have spent more time fixing someone else's mistake.</review>

if youre looking for an unprofessional experience...heres the place for you! hubby ordered, wrong order came. they forgot to include the personalized card. he called, the lady ensured him they were going to send out another bouquet the next day. instead, 1 hour later they came back with a smaller version of bouquet and repossessed the first bouquet. wow! im in awe! they cant even keep their word on comping for the mistake in the first place...and to note, this isnt the first time they messed up! they messed up before sending the wrong balloon for the occasion...a happy birthday instead of a mothers day balloon! mistake after mistake!<//Text>

Great pool. They have locker rooms - be sure to bring your own lock. If you are going regularly get on the mailing list since it has to close somewhat frequently (which is not uncommon for pools but they are a little more prone to issues than some other pools I have used). Also water temperature is good if you are actually swimming.< /Review>

<Text>This is a beautiful outdoor pool. I have no experience of the men's locker room, but the women's locker room is perfectly adequate: basic and functional. The lap swim hours are convenient. What a wonderful aspect of living in Temescal!<//Text>< pics>

Overall mediocre pool. Takes forever to get a membership card. Has been closed a few random times. The lane speed etiquette is hard to understand and not well enforced.< /text>

Great pool, it's longer than usual, 33. It's an outdoor pool and is great for kids when they have public swim sessions during the summer. Lap swim is great to for swimmers fr experienced to still learning.<//text>

A serious swimmers pool. No fooling around in the slow lane. A decent locker room that is occasionally clean and stocked with soap. The showers are kinda 'tight.' Great water pressure on the showers. The pool is relatively uncrowded, The slow lane at least.</review>

<Review>Temescal also has a Master's team.  This pool has the most lap swim hours in the City of Oakland city pools between Master's hours + city lap swim hours.

Pool is 33 yards long and is roughly 79-80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Times of lap swim does change seasonally, so be sure to check the City of Oakland official website before heading over.

Please note, this pool is a chlorinated pool and not saline treated. (Fun fact, public entities are required to use a chemical disinfectant as a primary source of disinfectant. It's part of county health code.)

During the summer the offer a robust list of programs including swim lesson, Jr. Lifeguard, youth recreation swim team, lap swim, and recreation swimming for the community. Staff is usually local young adults that have grown up in the Oakland Parks and Recreation Youth Development program and want to give back in the community!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80857de4efe15207:0x67b88596df87a647< /Gmap_id></record>

This is the most poorly managed pool I have ever been to. The temperature is never consistent. During the winter it would get to 70 degrees. The chemicals are always off leading to random pool closures all the time. Happened again today... About 1/3 of the time I show up there is a poorly written sign taped to the front that it’s closed for the reasons above or just tells you that the temperature is way off so you drive there ready to swim only to find out you can’t. The actual pool is nice when everything is working, which is why I’ll give it 2 stars instead of 1.<//Review>

I'm a visitor to this pool and it is indeed a gem. The crowd is varied, but unified in their friendly, respectful attitudes. Basic public locker room kept up well every time I've been there.</text>

Love this pool, the condition, availability and the slow, medium, an fast swimmer lane management that helps with the rare "lane entitlement" issues.< /Review>

Too crowded. 6 swimmers sharing one lane. Other lanes had 3-5 people in them plus people resting in lane corners.

You can't see if it's crowded before paying and entering, and the pool has a no refund policy. The staff shouldn't continually admit people while its crowded. I went with a group of four and we wouldn't have gone had we'd known it was so crowded.</text>

<review>I've been wanting to do this for a long time. I finally did it and I'm very pleased with the result. The technician was well-informed, and gave useful suggestions. It only took about 2 hours to install. It functions perfectly in a space that needed extra lighting. I am looking forward to endless days of sunlight - and moonlight! See before and after pics (I did open blinds a bit for the after pic).< /review>< Pics>

<text>We are very happy and satisfied with the Solatube daylight installation.  The installer, Robert W., did an excellent job and accomplished two installations in under 3 hours.  His demeanor was professional and he answered all of our questions.  Our kitchen and dining room are bright now, exceeding our expectations.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone and especially want to thank Robert for his excellent work.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>The finished product exceeds expectations. Chase was polite, communicated clearly, adjusted the size of the Solatube as per my original thoughts and made sure that the location was a good fit with the limitations of the water pipes in the attic. He protected my homes surfaces and carefully placed drop clothes. He cleaned up thoroughly after installation. He explained every step. The only reason for 3 stars is that he inadvertently drilled a hole in my new roof under solar panels. He was not aware that the panels were on the roof and I now will need to have shingles replaced and hopefully will not have to uninstall solar panels to do so. He was very forthcoming about the issue and the company will take care of the invoice for repairs. Once the repairs are complete and invoice covered, I will upgrade my review with additional star(s).

Update: After a couple of months, the repairs to my roof were made and Solatube did pay my roof contractor. They fulfilled their end of the bargain, although not quickly. Because of the difficulty of resolution of the roof problems, I still will deduct 1 star.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Randy is professional, courteous, and polite. Summers are getting hotter and we needed the right solution. Randy explained the science behind a whole house fan system versus purchasing an extra FAU with A/C. I was clear on what I am getting and it's perfect for our situation. I am a builder of high end luxury residential homes (Four by Four Construction, Inc.), and recommend Randy Martin for your whole house fan and Solatube needs. Thanks, David Fargo</review>

This is the second time that I've installed solar tubes in my home. They are addicting, I'm telling you! I can't say enough great things about this company and their staff. They are not only courteous, but they are also efficient, and extremely professional all at a great value. I highly recommend them.<//review>

<Review>A big fan of Solatube.  Doing a remodel in a small condo and the Solartube add just the right amont of light in a dark area.  Needed a filter to dim some of the light and they had a filter to do that.  Very pleased.< /Review>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This was a very easy and efficient solution to my dark closet. The whole process was easy from the sales guy I met at the fair to the installer. One cool thing they do is send you texts and emails with a picture of who will be showing up at your door to do the installation. Once he was here I asked for a 2nd tube to be installed in another room and he did it not problem. Would highly recommend.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We are excited about the product, and the representative was so enthusiastic about it and how it would lighten up the space.  He was also professional and kind and thoughtful about our carpets.  But the enthusiasm was the best.< /text>

I have dealt with Solatube several times over many years. They are unfailingly polite, efficient and easy to work with. Better still, their products are excellent and represent very good value.  Should you choose to work with them, I have no doubt you'll be very pleased.</Review>

<Review>Robbie Woolley came over to provide a quote for solar tubes for my dark upstairs hallway and guest bathroom. After he explained in detail the advantages of their product and provided a fair quote I decided to move forward. What surprised me is that he came prepared to do the job right then and there. I asked how long it would take- he said 4 hours- well he finished the job in less than that and the outcome was beautiful. The 14 inch solar tubes did the job, and the squared fixtures diffused the light in the hallway and bathroom- it felt like the lights were on. To my pleasant surprise the night lights came on after sunset. This is something I should have done years ago. I would recommend this product and Robbie to anyone. Good job guys. Al.<//Review>< Response>

<text>I have had four solatubes installed throughout my house. This has been the most professional and service-oriented business I have seen, especially in the home improvement/construction industry. The guys (Sacha, Max, and Ian) were very squared-away - their desire to ensure perfection and quality in everything they did was so impressive and rarely seen these days. Both the product and the accompanying service has thus far exceeded our expectations, and we highly recommend this company to anyone looking to enhance the natural lighting or cooling aspects of their home.<//text>< Pictures>

I just had a Solatube installed today in the master bedroom (dark) closet which is bright and clear now !  The people of Solatube in Carlsbad do a great job, they're in and out in no time.  Installation time was just less than 2 hours.  This is the second Solatube I've had installed, and it's always a great experience to deal with.  I am very pleased.</Text>

Joey was my installer and he was wonderful. Did a great job, advised me on lots of little options and helped me pick the right options and placements for what I was trying to achieve. This is an incredible investment in my home, which will pay off for years to come. And you get a tax credit because these are energy friendly! Highly recommended!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Love our new Solatube Whole House Fan.  Robbie, who installed our unit, arrived early, answered all of our questions, discussed how the unit would be installed on our property, and provided information and literature on a 2nd product we inquired about.  We had a simple installation, Robbie had us up and running in less than one hour.  Very professional installation, I highly recommend Solatube, this product and their installation service.< /Text>

When we replaced the roof, we installed 6 solatubes, 1 in kitchen, 1 in den area, 1 in master bedroom, 1 in washer/dryer area of garage and 1 each with exhaust fans in the two windowless bathrooms.  Our home is now always cheery and bright.  Also in the windowless bathrooms, it is no longer required to use the lights even in the daytime.  The solatubes are attractive on the roof and also in the ceilings.  I would recomment these to everyone.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>After trying to get a leaking solar tube repaired for over two years, I finally found Solatube.  They had a person come out in the same week.  Our Solatube installer was knowledgeable, courteous, efficient, fast, and cleaned up after the installation.  He answered all of our questions and told us about tax deductions that could be applied at the end of the year.  He also installed a solar powered attic fan that was not part of the work order, but he had it on the truck and had time to install it.  We are delighted -  very pleased with the whole process,< /Review>< pics>

Super professional. Knowledgeable. On time. Pleasant to work with. Kept the job site very clean. Very happy! My once DARK bathroom is now nice and bright.  I went with the option to add a fan and the light. I am very happy with my decision. I highly recommend solatube!</Review>

The solatube 160 ISn Round we installed in our bathroom two days ago is much brighter than the replaced old one. It is not only bright enough for the room during the day, but also provides night light which is powered by its solar energy battery. The installation was efficient. It is a very nice experience to have it. Moreover it helps to save energy in order to keep our earth green.< /Review>

<Text>My house had 3 partially completed units when I bought it.  I took some of the parts in and “Josh” told me that they were indeed from your company.  I scheduled an appointment and had to hurry before the end of the year so that I could get my tax credit.  I told that to the person who was scheduling and he said, “No problem, we will get you your tax credit”.  The tech showed up at my house and informed me that he did not have the estimate, and of course tried to charge me extra.  Luckily I had the estimate in my email.  Then I was told that it would cost more because there were angles involved.  I had told the scheduler that fact, so why was it not in the estimate?  Then I was told that the original equipment was not Solatube, but it could still be done... for extra of course.  Then I was told that he had brought the wrong parts and would have to reschedule.  When I asked if it could be done before the end of the year... wait for it... I was told that I could not get a tax credit for a project “finish”, only for a complete and new project.  I asked him to leave and do not bother with anything with Solatube again.  I have encountered lies, scamming and incompetent employees at every step of the way.  Solatube is a poorly run company with typical employees that do not know their jobs.</Text><name>Kent Miller< /name>< user>

<review>The estimators came to my house and very throughly explained the system and the options. They made recommendations based on my needs, and quoted the system. They pointed out energy saving rebates and discounts. At installation, the installer was very friendly and professional. He first reviewed the details of the job, and once we decided on the exact location of the tubes, he covered the surrounding areas with drop cloths and did the installations. He explained the steps as he went, and gave me information about my roof and home condition. Upon completion of the tubes he showed me the details of the night light, cover options, and tubes. He throughly cleaned up. All in all, the system is great. It added light just where we need, so we don't have to turn electric lights on. The look great, and work very well, even on overcast days.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>We had two 10” diameter Solatubes, with light kits, installed yesterday. Our experience with Solatube Home in Vista CA was unsurpassed; from the phone call (and consequent) order placed with Caitlin Kluey, to the installation performed by Joseph Erickson. Both of those employees represent your firm with such professionalism, one hopes their value is recognized. Superb customer service seems to be waining these days. This is not the case with them. We love the quality of the product, the ease of the transaction, the efficiency of scheduling, but most importantly... the craftsman-like pride and careful approach Joseph takes while installing. He completed the installation in one short afternoon. Ultimately, the end product is how a company is measured. Working with your firm was a pleasure.

<Time>1554861915264</Time><Text>The serviceman was an hour late, causing us to cancel our dinner plans. I was called twice, each time telling me that he would be later than expected but had I known in advance that it would cause cancellation of long anticipated plans, I could have rescheduled. Because of this, I really don’t have confidence in your company and won’t be moving forward.< /Text><username>Lisa Adams</username>< user>

<Review>We used to love this restaurant.    I waited 35-45 minutes for food the last two times for pickup, after I’ve called in my order and then go to restaurant (approx 10 minutes.) if there is a back order on food, I would appreciate knowing up front.    My breakfast dish is definitely not prepared as it used to be-twice now.    My husband’s sauce had no flavor to speak of- on his regular dish.    We do not know if new people preparing food.. very disappointing.   We try to support our local restaurants especially during this hard time.. but, we have to pass now on Casa Mendoza for breakfast.</Review>< Pics>

We USED TO LOVE this place, especially during harvest season when we don't have time to run home and make breakfast or lunch (NOT ANYMORE)!!! We went in for lunch today and the owner segregated us and seated us in the corner on the opposite side of the restaurant from everyone else....because I brought my SERVICE DOG with me.... needless to say, we won't be going back.<//Review>

I have always loved going to Mendoza’s and the staff always friendly. This past Sunday morning my bf and I went and had the worst service ever. We ordered our food and when it came we did not get our tortillas. My bf asked the new waitress 3 times and his food was getting cold. We finally got them 20 minutes later and my bf told the other new waitress that his food was cold and he didn’t want them. The waitress offered to microwave his food and that was the final straw. He only paid for my food and his drink.< /Review>

<text>Amazingly good as always! Menudo for hubby and Chile Verde breakfast, eggs over easy for me.
I never thought I hear myself say this, though  . . .they served our meal too fast!  Didn't have time to drink coffee, eat chips and salsa, settle in, chat, nothing. Ordered, put sugar in coffee, got napkins and BOOM, our meal was there! But darned tasty,!< /text>< username>

The carnitas tacos were very good. We were the only people in there and the service was horrible. The waitress was more interested in talking to her friend in the corner that serving food. Like I said though. The meat was good. Wife liked her burrito.<//review>

Authentic Mexican food, great flavor! I'm super critical when it comes to Mexican food. Extensive kids menu options, including American food. Definitely worth the short drive off the 5 FW. I cleaned my plate! I like that they give you beans and salsa with chips. Very clean place and awesome customer service. Will definitely be stopping here again in the near future. Blessings! ❤️< /text>

Menudo and the Michelada was Delicious. And the prices were very fair. Especially for the quality of food/drink and service which was very good. It was my first time there but definitely not my last.< /review>

Breakfast here has been terrific. Complimentary chips and salsa is a great start to any meal. They have both Mexican and American meals and so far everything I've had has been great for the reasonable price. Including steak n eggs. Give it a try !< /Text>

My family and I moved here from San Jose. In San Jose there are a lot of family owned restaurants that are great. We have a few of our favorites, but when we moved here we noticed the wasn't  that many here in Tracy. I came to Mendoza's with my sister's and mother for the first time ordered the two item plate. It was SO good. I told my husband about this place and he had breakfast there while waiting to get our car fixed. We both agree it's probably the best Mexican Restaurant in Tracy. This place has officially become our favorite place to eat. The only down side is that they close so early, 2pm. There are days we want to go out to eat for dinner, but Mendoza is closed. It's probably better for our pocketbook that they close so early. Lol Nonetheless, highly recommended place and the prices are reasonable, amount of food you get is great (two thumbs up), service is wonderful and that place itself is very clean. If you ever get a chance to fit in dessert, try the Flan...it's homemade and they add something extra too. SUPER delicious. ☺👍👍< /text>

The restaurant was almost empty when we pulled up. By the time we got our food it was full. Great food, huge selection, excellent service and the prices are extremely reasonable. This is a place that we can afford to bring our family of 6 over and over again. We will be back<//Review>

<review>Went here and was waiting in line and the lady starting seating everyone behind me and never asked if I had been helped.  Then one of the employees took a dirty bean cup off of a table and went and refilled it and touched it with the clean laddle. Gross. Needless to say this is not the place for me.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Ok, so this place has the best breakfast burritos in tracy. They are the only place that opens at 7am and they use hashbrowns in the burritos. They stay pretty busy but there is rarely ever a line.<//review>

<Text>I am kind of lost at this place, I don't know what they want to be. They closed while I was eating just after noon. I wanted to try this place for a while but it is always closed. The machaca and eggs were not that good, sloppy and taste less. The salsa was hot but did not have the right flavors. The chips were served with the chips were out of a crock pot that looked like it was on the counter for a week. Not fresh and made me feel not safe about what I was eating.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>I don't like the lady or owner whom sits in the Lil walled off area and just stares at everyone. I mean if your gonna watch us all ear your food the least you can do is smile 😒 and why would you tell our waitress to go shut the blinds cuz its closing time (1/2 hr. To go) instead of helping us get our to go boxes...you could have done it..after all your just watching everything. It is very uncomfortable...yet who I can only believe are family members sitting at the bar just ordering food 1/2 hour before closing g are sitting drinking on the phone taking their time and make us feel unwanted. I won't go here again... There's too much drama going on even without all the talking....
So so disappointed.</Text>< pictures>

Fair food but bad service. No chips and salsa offered to us, but all other patrons had them on their tables. In addition, the wait staff never came by to check on us or offer to refill our water glasses. Considering it was rather slow at the time, both of us thought that was particularly poor form.</Text>

The restaurant is clean and you can choose from sitting at the counter or tables by the window.

We were greeted and seated within a reasonable time.  Their menu which was enormous had numerous pictures of the dishes to choose from and was reasonably priced.

The "service" itself was a disappointment for a place that wasn't so busy.  After being seated, we waited 10 minutes just to place our order and another 10 minutes for chips and salsa.

Our main order would take another 20 minutes or so to arrive, which I felt was unacceptable given the small crowd inside.

I noticed only one cook which could account for the slow service.  Everyone had already been served when we entered and were seated.

Although there were two waitresses on the floor, our waitress was more interested in yanking with her coworker who was eating and watching TV then to attend to their customer's needs.

I've had chips and salsa at numerous Mexican themed restaurants but this one was unique in that it included a "warm bean dipping sauce with a sprinkle of cheese (queso fresco)."

There was nothing special about the dip but added a new dimension and flavor.  Their salsa sauce was average and better than some others we have tried around town.

Because of the water shortage here in the state, this place won't serve you water unless you ask for it.

My water arrived with a slice of "wedged lime" which was dry and definitely not fresh.

Honestly, it's little attention to detail, such as making sure the garnish is fresh, goes a long way and says volumes about the your restaurant.

It also sets the stage for what the customers can expect.  In my opinion, I was having second doubts.

I ordered their two plate combo, which was a Chile Relleno and Beef Taco, and also included rice and beans.

My wife ordered the combination special (can't recall the name) which came sizzling hot in a "Pumice" style bowl and arrived steaming hot from the kitchen.

My Chile Relleno was average in taste and the pepper itself wasn't firm but more on the soft side.

The cheese was chewy but overpowering and took away the taste of the pepper.  Next was the beef taco, which was the other part of my combo plate.

I hate to say it but the beef was tough and dried out which for me spoiled the taco experience.  The shell was crispy but slightly on the greasy side.

The rice and refried beans was average in taste and texture, but how can you mess that up?

My wife's plate/bowl came with prawns, cactus, chicken, beef, and vegetables along with rice and beans.

The presentation itself looked appealing but you couldn't touch anything inside of this "lava boiling pot" for several minutes until the bubbling stopped!

The prawns were cooked just right and not overdone to the point where the meat would be too tough to chew.

I've never had cactus which hung loosely around my wife's pumice bowl.  The cactus itself didn't have any "distinct flavor" other than having a lemony taste.

The plant itself was somewhat chewy but is definitely an acquired taste.

Other garnishments included scallions, jalapeños, and radishes in a tomato based sauce.  Overall, my wife said she enjoyed her meal.

Overall, our experience here was average with the exception of the service which I felt could've used a lot of improvement.

The food didn't stand out but they did give you a lot for the price.

They say that word of mouth is what brings in the customers, but with better service, attention to detail (dried lime on water glass), and better food preparation, this place could gain more "exposure and a following."< /Text>

I recommended my brother-in-law to come in the other day with his family whom happened to be white people they were very disappointed in the fact that no one came to their table for 10 minutes and finally just asked if they wanted something to drink mean while they took and gave food to two other Latino families while his family was still sitting there without any food there were so embarrassed they got up and left<//Text>

Course in nice shape, even with our late tee time. Not a course to play when you have a two way miss off of the tee box. No consistency with my driver, lost four balls in the hills or penalty areas. Green undulations can't be seen on your approach shots, so you may end up further away than you think.<//review>

I played here for the first time on Father's Day. Located just above Auburn, this course has many unique holes and some with spectacular views. A very challenging course in the rolling hills with a lot of elevation change.< /review>

I’m going to be moving soon and have been looking for a storage to place my belongings. I stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot. Vincent was very helpful with the information he provided. As well as made me feel very comfortable with his friendly welcoming vibe. When it’s time to move I will definitely be looking into a storage here. The prices are great and the staff is amazing! Thank you!< /review>

<Review>I had to rent a unit out from this StorQuest in Bakersfield due to the pandemic. The customer service here was exceptional! Not one person I have spoken with made me feel uncomfortable and the whole process went smooth! The units are all secured in a gated community. In addition, when I vacated the unit, I had accidentally left a bag of nuts and screws on the floor. Since I live 2.5 hours away, there was no way I could just go back for it and they went even further as to offering to ship it back to me! If there is another reason why I would need to have a storage unit in Bakersfield, I wouldn't not think twice to come back here again!<//Review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

l decided to put my belongings here after checking out other self storage locations in town. I feel my thing's are safe and secure here especially with the type of locks the storage units come equipped with and security that is provided.
Staff is knowledgeable, friendly and professional and reside on the premises.<//Review>

<Text>I’ve been storing my stuff at U-Haul for a long time. Luckily for me, they ran out of storage units and I had to find units elsewhere. I wanted a drive up unit and came across StorQuest.

Wow! I wasn’t on hold for 20-30 minutes. I was on hold for less than five minutes - 3 minutes to be exact! THREE MINUTES - WOW! :) Isabel told me that I had a week to finalize my reservation for the 10x10 unit. Jessica called me and let me know when she was taking her lunch.

I went in later that afternoon and met Jessica - who showed me the unit I’d be renting. Perfect! She even told me what type of locks the unit could use - two different types.

THE UNIT

Oh my gosh, the unit was clean. Cleaner than any unit I’ve ever seen. The door is so easy to roll up and down; nothing like trying to open and close the doors at U-Haul’s storage facility. The locking mechanism is easy to latch too.

The security is awesome in this place too! I am definitely glad my stuff is here.< /Text>< pictures>

So glad I chose to go with StorQuest. The hours they have available beats all other storages. I can’t complain with any of it. Anita, the store manager was very helpful and very prompt with all interactions. Love this place. Thanks Anita for making it easy!<//text>

<Text>Anita was amazing. They were closing right when we arrived to their office. She was kind enough to unlock her office and walk back into her office to help us. My wife and I really needed to get a storage ASAP since we are closing escrow in two days. Anita came through for us (God bless you Anita). Great customer service. She also made the process super easy which is the reason they deserve five stars.</Text>< rate>

Very suddenly I found myself needing storage after acquiring a large amount of furniture. I was panicked about a safe place to keep it, but the excellent set up at StorQuest Self-Storage with the fences, keypad entry, hourly security rounds at night was the perfect place. it was a huge relief knowing that my property was in the safest possible place. The peace of mind I had from using this storage provider meant that I never had to worry!

I already felt this was an A+ service, but when they hired Anita, I knew their future service would be even better. How many places give the customer a reminder call BEFORE the payment is late?!? She did! Her personality is professional while still showing that she truly cares about the customers. She isn’t just going through the motions. She goes above and beyond expectations, making a positive impression in all she does.

If you ever need storage in Bakersfield, you u really need to check them out. You won’t be sorry! I know that if I need storage space again (and I’m sure I will!), I won’t need to shop around — I will go straight back to StorQuest Self Storage and talk to Anita!</review>

< Review>
We chose StorQuest Self Storage in Bakersfield for its convenience and clean appearance while transitioning to a new out-of-state location.  On a few occasions we had to communicate with the management (Anita) of the facility, because of changes in our plans, and found them to be responsive, accommodating and pleasant to deal with.< /Review>

Have been to a number of storage facilities and few are able to provide actual information in relation to pricing, availability and recommendations based on storage needs.They say, "Great help is hard to find," well look no further than this location. Jessica, was able to accommodate me and will be referring colleagues to this location. Thank you for your assistance again, Jessica.<//text>

Anita was exceptionally helpful and understanding during a financial crisis I was having. Anita explained to me what I needed to do to stave off a lien sale on my unit and allow me the time to catch up on my account. I'm extremely grateful to her. I would recommend anyone to rent from her facility. You will never feel like they're out to get you. Anita will go the extra mile to help you out.</Text>

I retract my five star rating down to zero if I could!  Within a 1 month period my RV was vandalized twice and all I was told was that they were not responsible, which I’m aware of but if I’m paying for a secure storage where they have security cameras and some attending the place how could the vandalize not be caught....   I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time but the second no way!!! BOTTOM LINE DONT RENT FROM THIS PLACE!!!

Anita was great to work with!  Great customer service.  Nice clean facility!< /text>

The one thing I was not happy with is that it is required that you have insurance to cover your property. I mean yes, generally speaking this is a good thing but it shouldn't stop you from getting a storage unit with them.  Signing a waiver indicating you will not hold the business responsible if something should happen would be a good option.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>AMAZING SERVICE!!!!

An incredible kind and helpful young woman (Anita) has managed this place ever since I started storing my things there (Over 2 years), and every time I go, I am treated with kindness, respect, and courtesy. Always proactive with her service and keeps an extremely close eye on the property. Every time I go there I see Anita out “patrolling” the grounds and picking up little bits of garbage, and ensuring every unit that should be locked up is actually locked up. Wonderful l experience with them! Very professional. I always recommend!

*GREAT RATES
*VERY CLEAN
*EXTREMELY SAFE
*SUPER FRIENDLY & PROFESSIONAL

I NEVER had a problem here, always more than happy to help. I wouldn’t rent anywhere else!

Thank you!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

Very friendly. Most business interactions become automated or generic...Jessica still focused on the customer. It’s ok to have a conversation, share a story...be genuine in order to provide the customer not just a product, but an experience and a service as well. Thanks Jessica!</Text>

<text>Ive had my stuff here over a year now. I went from a small locker size to the next to the largest. Theyre pretty affordable. The place is nice and clean and very secure. Hours to access your unit is 6 am to 10 pm so you can avoid the bright sun and go after dark. I wish they had a bathroom.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>My husband and I go to church with the manager here and we needed a storage unit right away and when we went in and asked her about getting a unit she helped us right away! She was actually helping someone before us and we had to wait a few minutes but as we waited we got to see her at work! She was so helpful and friendly with the customer. She has wonderful customer service skills! You don't get that at a lot of places anymore. But she really did care! When she helped us we were more than satisfied! She explained everything we needed to know and walked us to the unit to show us and made sure it was to our satisfaction. And it was! Anita is a wonderful and caring person! Wether we go to church together or not I believe she would be the same person! If your looking for a storage unit this place is it! Great service, Great prices, Easy paperwork process and a Great manager! I give this place and the customer service 10 stars if I could!!!!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>I am extremely pleased and impressed with StorQuest . I went there the other day to secure an incredible price for a 10 x 10 unit. Anita helped me, and she was incredibly courteous and helpful. My unit was spotless and in great shape. Everyone behind the counter was friendly, making me feel very welcomed. Moving is stressful enough, so it's great to have one less worry. Thank you.< /Review><response>{'time': 1524227996885, 'text': 'Ignacio, your wonderful feedback and rating mean a lot to us.

I have the easiest time with StorQuest. As a returning college student, they are always the best option for me. This location is pretty new to my knowledge it’s a nice facility, everything is in great condition, and their storage process is pretty straight forward.

Anita the Store Manager is extremely helpful and is my preferred go-to if any issues arise. I’ve been storing my things with them for the past two years and my only regret is not storing with StorQuest sooner.</review>

<Text>I went to look at Unit 10×20 double Door
Which is a Nice Unit , but no lighting inside the Space. I was then the Price of the unit of , if I decied to move-in at the Special Rate of $25 process fee & 5 month. @ $ 75.00 a  Month , and Proof  of Insurance (Renters) and that turn into a three or Four day  Fiasco between What Freaking Papers were Right or wrong it was so Bad, i had to Three - Way with my Insurance Company Allstate and Storquest cause Storquest couldn't receive the Emails that were sent.  Previously So I call Storquest to find out what was the whole Up ! I was told by the Agent in the Office of Storquest that I would get the Space for $25+$75 for a Special Move-in Rate for Five or six months! The Office Manager Changed that all of a sudden the Office Manager couldn't find what was type into the system on screen, She changed it to $92 a month $117 to move-in she better than a Used Car Sales Person! I was paying attention to her every move Smooth Operator! after I Signed up I find that there's NO RESTROOMS FOR THE  Tenants on Site! I told too go Use  Starbuck's RESTROOMS! And Gate code Eleven Digits Long. Fine $ 25.00 charge if Someone in your move- in party tailgates Crazy!. 2☆☆<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Your security really needs some updates. Our trailer was broken into 4 times.  First it started out with the boxes, then the final straw was they actually broke a window to get inside and ransacked our trailer. This happened after we advised them to update there security. Good luck if you store your trailer there.< /text>

<review>Warning: Do not leave your Rv here, in 1 year it has been broken into 4 times. First our outdoor boxes then they broke our window and vandalized it. We asked them to upgrade security and they do nothing to improve. Stor quest gives u no answers and say they can’t do anything but call the police. They won’t even show u security video almost like they don’t even care. This place is not safe and secure like the website says so please don’t leave your Rv trailer here.<//review><user>112729022833126948759<//user>< Date>

I had a bad experience with this storage place. They charged more then I was quoted on the phone, asked me to pay full price while they had a move in special for half price. They suggested I get 2 storage units ,I had a 26×8' trailer and got a 30×10' . The front desk said it would not fit and suggested o got 2 units.all of this had me to believe they were greedy and not looking out for there customers. I was behind on payments so it did not bother me for the late fees that is not a issue. But today I called them it was the last day to make my payment. They said my unit was sold in auction this morning.  I did not receive 1 call from them this week. I have spoken with them previous to this week and was told I can pay today. Never told it was going to be sold today. There was never a time listed in any e mails or voice messages . The lady who rented me the unit seen the valuable things in the unit I believe It was in there best interest to keep it with several thousand dollars worth of furniture in it. Single father of 10 year old twins this will not be easy to replace. I'm very disappointed in this lack of professionalism and was spoken to very rude when I called today to ask about my unit.i don't know what I can do not they have sold my furniture including my bedroom set and kids furniture and bunk beds. I will try and seek legal advice but bottom line is they are greedy thieves in my eyes because my unit was stolen and sold for profit.poor management.and I would not go back or recommend this spot to anyone.<//Text>

Anita took my reservation on the phone and was waiting with a duke when I arrived. She was patient and answered all my questions. Out was so quick and easy. She took me on a tour of the property. It's clean and well maintained. Security gates and 24 hr surveillance.

Update 4-29-21
I left to go to a facility closer to my post office box and I genuinely missed the unprecedented security and access hours of storquest. You just cant beat 6am to 10pm if u have auto pay. I was stuck with a 9-5 access for the past year at another facility.
I came back to story quest today and Jessica the Property Manager made the transition back effortless.</text>

An incredible kind and helpful young woman (Anita) has managed this place ever since I started storing my things there (Over a year), and every time I go, I am treated with kindness, respect, and courtesy. Always proactive with her service and keeps an extremely close eye on the property. Every time I go there I see Anita out “patrolling” the grounds and picking up little bits of garbage, and ensuring every unit that should be locked up is actually locked up.

*GREAT RATES
*CLEAN
*EXTREMELY SAFE
*SUPER FRIENDLY & PROFESSIONAL

I NEVER had a problem here, always more than happy to help. I wouldn’t rent anywhere else!

Thank you!!</text>< pics>

My Experience there from beginning to end has been exceptional. The girl there Tanya is so pleasant. Her customer service was key for me. I completely chose my storage unit based off what we spoke about on the phone and later coming to view it. She helped me pick a unit that doesn't get to hot and had the perfect size for my possessions. I totally love how clean the facilities are. I also love the option to add coverage to give you added insurance that your precious cargo is secure and safe. They have security surveillance and and on site employee at all times. This place is perfect!!!!</Text>

I was not rushed off she patiently gave me a tour of the property showed me my unit. The property was nice and clean. Great location. Anita's been with the company for 5 years she spoke very highly of Storquest. Right when I mentioned shopping around for prices she waisted no time comparing this facility to her competition. Anita was defenitly on her A game. Her awesome customer sercive would not let me walk out the door very kind young lady. I would highly recommend to others looking for storage!<//Review>< username>

Customer service here was really great and they were very accommodating. I stored my vehicle there and it all went very smoothly. Right before I had to leave for a long period of time, I got a flat tire and they were very understanding and helpful to my situation. I have my vehicle back now and have already recommended them to a friend.<//Review>

Found a great deal on a storage unit. Not only was the property clean and sufficient, but the Manager Anita went above and beyond to assist me! She made me feel more than just a customer! She went over all of my options at my budget and we found the best deal! Thanks to Anita, this nightmare has become more pleasant!< /Review>

<text>My boyfriend have been looking for a good, legit and cheap storage place for awhile. When we came across Stor It, Heather helped us and she gave us the best customer service! She was friendly and gave us plenty of information about the place and also answered all our questions! We found a good size storage with a reasonable price and with plenty of discounts. I highly recommend this place.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Pros: Excellent service here! They are very quick and to the point while still remaining very thorough. The unit I was assigned was also very convenient. It's also very secure.

Cons: Pricing was too expensive for the small 5x10 unit I was using. $55/month with autopay, and my first month wasn't $1 like their promo and reps said it would be. Also, whenever I'd go back there would be a bunch of dust inside my unit from being blown inside from the outside of it. A lot of that dirt got on my bed and on my other belongings, which are very sensitive items.
*Update: Also, my second time here I got a 5x10 unit again, but this time they gave me a worse unit that is very exposed and requires 2 locks that they charged me twice the price for ($40). Totally not fair. The agent on the phone said I only needed 1 lock, but in person they said otherwise. Now I have 3 locks by them that I paid a total of $60 for. Ridiculous how they make their money.

Overall, I would say this place can be okay if you really need to butcher your move. If anyone decides to come here, just be cautious and make sure all of your items are covered and clean at all times. Don't hesitate to confront them about anything and if you have a problem then let them know.</Review>< pictures>

We had a great experience, the weekend prior our storage was broken into (not at this place) and it left us feeling violated and weary of other storages.

We walked in, no appt and Jessica was there, she even put off her lunch to show us a unit and walk us through the process.

That is the type of customer service every employee needs to have.

Thank you Jessica!!!!</review>

I have stored my overflow belongings with Stor Quest for years.  The prices are reasonable and the units are very well maintained.

The property Manager Anita Rodriguez is professional, friendly and is always helpful.

I recommend Stor Quest to anyone needing additional storage space.</Text>

Where to begin about there customer service. My husband had dropped money while cleaning our unit and I had no clue what to do I called to see if just maybe they seen it and sure enough Kendra the employee found it  and put in the office for us. I was tears to my eyes to even believe she did keep it there are  nice people out there and she totally was an honest person they really could not have any body better working for their company. Best place to have a storage unit!!!!!</Review>

Very friendly service, clean, easy access, located in a fairly nice middle class neighborhood (so break-ins less likely) I searched all the sites and this was the best deal in Bakersfield. ($1 first mo $20 admin fee, then $28/mo for a 5X5 with easy drive-up access.) PLUS a nice Basque restaurant next door! Anita R. was very personable and professional!< /Text>

< Review>
You should know what a valuable employee you have, her name is Anita and she works at the Bakersfield CA location. She went above and beyond what is probably expected of her job and I was impressed with the cleanliness of the facility. A it's was cheerful and professional and helped me de-stress when I was at my wit's end with several other storage places. Give her a huge raise/bonus...It will be money well spent.<//Review>

Had an issue my storage unit was broken into and was not informed for a month that my lock was missing. I was told to come down to purchase a new lock and to make sure nothing was stolen, that was not the case. Went to the office couldn't make a police report because, my name is not the primary on the account. When I finally did talk to the police department the girls in the office at StorQuest gave the officer a hard time when trying to get the video surveillance. I have renter's insurance through StorQuest so I have a claim that is in the process of being handled. Even though this is going on 3 months now and im not getting anywhere. I feel like I'm having to jump through hoops all the way around just to get compensated for my lost items. When in reality I should have been informed sooner that my lock was missing but, the girl who runs the office was on vacation when my unit was broken into. So whoever was taking her place obviously was not doing their job.< /Review>

Had an issue my storage unit was broken into and was not informed for a month that my lock was missing. I was told to come down to purchase a new lock and to make sure nothing was stolen, that was not the case. Went to the office couldn't make a police report because, my name is not the primary on the account. When I finally did talk to the police department the girls in the office at StorQuest gave the officer a hard time when trying to get the video surveillance. I have renter's insurance through StorQuest so I have a claim that is in the process of being handled. Even though this is going on 3 months now and im not getting anywhere. I feel like I'm having to jump through hoops all the way around just to get compensated for my lost items. When in reality I should have been informed sooner that my lock was missing but, the girl who runs the office was on vacation when my unit was broken into. So whoever was taking her place obviously was not doing their job.< /text>

awesome experience first time I've ever rented storage and it was wonderful.........the people in charge went out of their way to make sure my move went well........I used the moving truck and found it in excellent condition I just couldn't believe how smooth it all went  cudos guys.......and I've worked in 2-local self storage places and they can't even begin to compare to what Stor it had....thanks again alex and Jennifer for taking such good care of me<//Review>

<Review>Storquest is giving all the companies out here in Bakersfied a run for their money! Prices are very competetive. What I loved about this facilty was the cleaniness of the property and the customer service! Now n days that is very hard to find. Anita made me not just feel like a valued customer but she showed me she cares! I highly recommend storquest to all my friends and family!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>
