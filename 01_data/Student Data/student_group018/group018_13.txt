When I went to the T-Mobile store to buy a new phone, Sergio was extremely helpful and informative about the products and how to gain the best possible deal on them. Also, he did a great job putting on my screen protector and I was really grateful for his help in transferring data over from my old phone. Overall, I had a great experience there.< /Review>

The best customer service ever! I needed to add a line to my plan and upgrade my phone and all the staff went to the extra mile to ensure we were taken care of. They made sure our devices were working correctly and even took the time to give a tutorial on the new devices.< /review>

I stopped by the shop on my way to LAX to get 2 SIM cards for my family. Savana and Josh tried to  issue the cards. However, they  failed to issue the cards and I got late for the airport . I guess Ill never learn that T-Mobile is a real bad service company. The place is very conveniently located in Seal Beach 🏝, just off Interstate 405. Tow stars for the good reception and location.< /Review>

When we came to switch over to T-Mobile last July, the sales representative, Brice, offered us a promotion: to trade in our iPhone 8 devises for new iPhone 11 devises. No contract and no strings attached. They assured us that we could always switch to another carrier penalty free. We are moving soon to a location that doesn’t have t mobile coverage and we just learned that we owe thousands of dollars to T mobile because the store mislead us.

Nice people but please for the love of God stop wasting time with small talk with other customers that you're supposed to be helping. I walk in and I see both employees busy with customers. One employee is actually doing something and getting a couple of phone while the other is just making small talk. I'm not here to listen to Mindless small talk when an employee is clearly not doing anything except standing there and talking. If you're not going to help the other customers then at least help me otherwise don't waste time with needless small talk and take care of the other customers and then come to me.< /Review>

<Text>We can't support this store enough. They transferred four lines from another carrier and took us through the process easily. Pricilla, Jeffery and Luis represented their company well. Separating from the other carrier was the hard part, but T-Mobile support made it worth our time. Huge savings on the current four lines for $40, unlimited plan.

Worst customer service ever! Read great reviews about Rodney. Sadly, he went on break when I arrived and I was stuck dealing with a guy who was horrible! I bought the s5 and paid cash. He didn't set my phone up correctly, didn't transfer my contacts, was apathetic about the entire sale and almost forgot to set up my new blue tooth. All of this took 2 hours! I'm 9 months pregnant and standing that long was very unpleasant.  If I shell out $800 cash I expect some type of quality service.<//Text>

Staff was very unprofessional and not helpful at all when I needed a replacement sim card. I've been a customer for years and used the same sim card the entire time and the staff wouldn't offer me a replacement. Instead they wanted 15$ for the chip. I mentioned that the chip was being sold for $0.99 on their website after the 'SIM99' promo code and they thought it was a funny joke as if I was buying out of some garage sale. T-mobile needs to hire people who take the time to inform themselves of their own company's products/promotions and know how to treat their customers.

Overall, I had a poor experience here with unprofessional/ignorant staff. I would not recommend coming here nor should T-mobile sustain this store's employees.< /Review>

< Review>
Spent almost $100 for terrible service, waiting over an hour (keep in mind there was only two other couples waiting inside), and okay sushi. The rolls are tiny and eh in flavor. If they tell you it’s a 20 minute wait expect to be there over an hour. You’re money is better off at another local sushi place. WORST SUSHI PLACE IN ANTIOCH, OAKLEY, & BRENTWOOD!

(Also this place used to be an Indian restaurant that was actually pretty good. Inside you can see their previous decor revolving Indian cuisine. DON’T BELIEVE THEIR DELICIOUS LOOKING POSTERS OUTSIDE, IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THIS!)< /Review>

I got the beef bento box and got my girlfriend the dragon roll. The beef in the bento box tasted oily and greasy. I didn't like the California roll part either. The salad in the bento was good, the fried shrimp tasted like crunchy Styrofoam, and the fried dumplings were good but too small. My girlfriend said the dragon roll was "Decent but not good, lets not go again." Overall we didn't like the food.< /Review>

<Review>First time stopping by while driving my wife to work! And I am amazed how FRESH that food ended up being when I took that first bite! I ordered the Beef & Shrimp. I didn't want the rice, but there was no option to replace with more vegetables. But that's okay. As soon as I took that first bite, I ended up burning my lip. BUT THAT WAS OKAY because I realized how FRESH that food was cooked. I recommend this to those who like food that just came from Pan to Plate!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Great food and even better service. A hidden gem in Brentwood of classic Asian cuisines. The food was nicely presented and tasted great. Prices aren't super cheap but you get quality for your money. Was made to feel very welcome by the servers!</review>< rate>

The place requires you to wear a mask and vice versa the staff are wearing them too. When you go inside to order your food, they’re definitely social distancing! The staff wear friendly. It was a little loud inside the restaurant so the girl at the counter could barely hear me, I had to speak louder. Of course, I was also wearing a mask.

The food: I was really craving for sushi so we ordered Two sushi rolls one with salmon (Res Bull) and one with tuna (Rock n Roll): they were ok, the rice on the roll seemed over cooked. We also ordered Tempura Shrimp and Chicken and Terriyaki Chicken. The tempuras were very greasy and not much shrimp meat.

This spot was ok not one of my favorites. But it hit the spot!!!</text>

I would give this place 2 1/2 stars. Ordered Salmon Love roll. The portions was good the roll was dry. The Salmon sashimi slices starting to get old. I ordered vegetables Tempura and got only sweet and sour sauce. I got a Mango milk tea it looked small 12-16 oz.</review>

just tried this place for lunch and am very happy that I did. We enjoyed the Lion King and Rock n Roll rolls as well as the small octopus appetizer. Everything tasted fresh and very yummy. 4 starts as they didn't give me much wasabi and my salmon skin handroll was just a salmon handroll. Not what I ordered but still very good.</Review>

We went for lunch after fruit picking in Brentwood - service was prompt and friendly and the food was good. They offer mild, medium, and spicy levels for spice, so make sure to pick what works for you. Menu is quite extensive and has several vegetarian and non-veg options. I ordered coconut shrimp curry and the shrimp was fresh and cooked to perfection. Overall, five stars!</Text>

Such a wonderful place to eat and relax. Food is incredible, you ask for what you get too! I enjoy my meals HOT! And they make it so darn perfect. The vegetarian soup is excellent! The shrimp tandoori is amazing and quite a presentation. So happy to have a place so close to home ♡ Lovely staff. I wish this place well for as long as I shall live ♡ My mouth and tummy are always satisfied. ♡< /review>

I ordered online and went to pick up 5 minutes after the time they told me it will be ready but they were not ready to wait for 5 minutes.  6 orders got picked up while I was sitting and waiting for almost 45 minutes. I had to ask three times before I got it and they acted like what they did is right. Don’t over promise and under delivered just saying<//review>

Food is great!! Delivery is quick. It has never given me an upset stomach. Usually I have to order Mild at Indian restaurants but can handle Medium at this one. It's not as spicy as most Indian restaurants which is good for the American palet. If you prefer your food to be spicy spicy, just let them know.<//review>

Sad to say we haven't been impressed by many restaurants in this area, but this place has consistently VERY impressed! Third time in, we have take out from here and the lamb vindaloo is excellent, the naan is great, the sauces are fantastic, and the saffron rice is nutty and delicious! Very happy :)< /review>

<Text>Ordered chicken tika and there was no curry, super thick mixture but when I asked they brought me a side of curry that I had to add myself... which I is why I’m giving 2 stars but they should have remade the dish. The greeter, waitress, and taking phone order was all 1 person that was also babysitting. Service was extremely slow and food was below average. They need to step up their game big time.</Text><user_id>108194394542559401811</user_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This was our first time eating here but it seemed like theplace just opened up and the wait staff were greenhorns. There was no sense of organization the food needed more spices and food were being sent back because it didn't taste like what it should be and that was from a lady who i believe was also Asian. That was sad. The service was very slow although we got our food with in a few minutes. Other people who were already sitting when we walked in still did not receive their food even before we left out and have paid for our lunch. Will not be returning.</Review>

<Review>Food was ok...

Service was UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!

I ordered food to drop off at my daughter's lunch as a treat.  I ask for not spicy or mild.   It was so hot my wife could not even eat it.

I like hot, but it was not for me.

I called and spoke to the manager and he argued that I said medium not mild.   I said "not spicy"???    And started arguing with me.   Even though he want there at the time.

So my daughter had rice and bread for lunch.

Thanks for nothing.</Review>< userid>

Quick and good service. Good food! I had chicken korma and mango chutney with garlic naan. It all tasted very nice.
I also had mango lassi, I could taste that the mango's were canned, but it was still good. I saw there were a lot of bad reviews lately so I was skeptical, but I wanted Indian. It was well worth it!!< /Review>

The worst restaurant I ever had food, expect turmeric there is nothing in the food, better they get educated on Indian food before they serve to the customers.< /review>

One horrible place . We first half hour for some one to take or order . Second , we waited for 40 mins for order to arrive but it failed finally . We never got our food .  We checked with the chef about the order , they had not even started making it .  We asked the should we wait and will the arrive ? They failed to give a promising answer . We finally walked out without food . Horrible management< /Text>

<Text>I've been taking my pets to Doctors Heidi & Wayne for TWENTY years, and they and their staff area absolutely the best, most caring, most well-run and efficient veterinary clinic one could imagine.  We trust them implicitly with the care of our three dogs.  We very highly recommend Brook Ellis Pet Hospital!<//Text><rating>5< /rating>< user>

My yorkie fur baby had acquired a weird cough and obviously wasn't feeling well. I was visiting from out of town, called and as a new client was able to get a appointment that same day.
The staff was prompt, courteous, polite and professional. With covid I had to wait in my car as my pup was taken inside, but I could tell he was in good hands.
A few minutes later a man came to my vehicle. It was the Vet who came to speak in person, not just a voice over the phone. He explained my pups diagnosis in terms I could understand, as well as the treatment options.
My pup received TOP NOTCH treatment and I felt I was treated with legitimate concern for his well-being.
All in all, he's better and although I live over an hr from their office, the service & care they provide is WELL WORTH the drive!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

The best pet clinic. Small little building. Huge on service. We are new here and didn’t know what to expect. Super friendly and professional. Jimmy was made very comfortable. Dr Heidi examined him and gave Him his vaccine without him even knowing it
The techs were hands on and very friendly.
Thank you to everyone. Jimmy will now have a new vet. Dr Heidi. You’re AWESOME< /Text>

I took my 5 year old pup, Max, in to BrookEllis for a 2nd opinion. I really appreciate Dr. Heidi explained what she felt was going on with Max and took the time to give me background and answer my questions. I felt so relieved after speaking with Dr. Heidi, and knew I made the right decision to switch vets.<//review>

<Review>From Marcia in Fountain Valley....I have been going to Brook Ellis Pet Hospital for 22 YEARS!  I wouldn't think of taking my 'kids' anywhere else.  Dr. Wayne and Dr.Heidi are so compassionate, kind, caring and very knowledgeable.   I have had some very difficult cases and decisions to make over the years and they both take the time and have the patience to let me know all of my options.  Their Staff is absolutely the best and ALWAYS treat me like family with the utmost respect, efficiency and kindness.  I'd give Brook Ellis Pet Hospital and Staff 10 STARS if I could!  Love them all.....<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
For about 10 years, Dr. Wayne Kopit and staff cared for my five rabbits until the last geriatric rabbit died at age 11. Dr. Kopit treated them with expertise, kindness, and affection. Rabbits are very fragile animals and require expert care, which I received at Brook-Ellis. Now Dr. Kopit cares for my poodle mix, Chloe. She was a very ill dog which we adopted from a Los Angeles Animal Shelter in 2015. Chloe was extremely malnourished and had multiple infections and dermatitis of various kinds. Only by Dr. Kopit’s care and our attention do we believe Chloe survived. I have been through many sad moments with our rabbits, and many scary times with Chloe, but Dr. Kopit knows how much our pets mean to us and always provides care and attention to us, the caretakers of our dear animals.< /review>

<review>I took my leopard gecko [hippo] here after I apparently pulled out a go and from her head. right behind her eye she had this literal hole you coukd see her tendons and everything. but she had an infection of some kind and over time this thing on her face got to rrally bother her so I thought I could helo by taking the scab off.. well that along with seriously half of her face came out. it was almost the size of a dime. no joke. anyways sbes been greatly taken cafe of and also the dr researches with his resources on what all that was with my gecko and he discovered it talking with this other reptile specialist! so thanks guys really.  and hippos currently MIA has been for about a week now. I'm a wreck without her.  keep her in your tboights please. 😭<//review>< Pics>

Dr. Kennedy took a couple test and right away he found that she had bone cancer. Everyone here is so KIND, GENTLE, knowledgeable & understanding just couldn't ask for a better support team for your loved family member they're helped her to be as comfortable as possible.

I have moved all 7 of my cats and dogs to this practice, for the one reason that Smith Flat Animal Hospital uses mercury and adjuvant-free vaccines. In addition, there is no pressure to choose all vaccines, and respect for individual choices for our pets’ care. Today I brought in two of my pets who needed care, and Dr. Kennedy was respectful, wise, compassionate, and very helpful in providing information and explaining everything clearly and simply. This was THE best experience at a vet’s office that I have ever had. The entire staff was wonderful. I am so grateful this practice is here and do not plan to use any other.</text>

They gave me options on care and don't judge on my decisions. After all.... I know my pets best. I have also had AWESOME phone care, saving me $$ because they were able to help and diagnos over the phone, for which they were spot on as to what happened. Follow up phone calls leads me to believe they too also care about my pets, and to make sure they are doing the right thing. Very professional.<//text><rating>5</rating></record>

<Name>Roni Dewitt<//Name><Date>1496118157502<//Date><rating>5</rating><text>I recently had to put down my 17 year old cat. His regular vet doesn't do that so I called Smith Flat. When I called them I told them he was 17, had stopped eating seemed to be  having trouble breathing and I thought he was in pain. No more questions were needed, they didn't judge.  They let me bring him right in, even though they were closing in 15 minutes. They stayed open, didn't rush us or make us feel pressured. They were really sweet and caring. A couple days later I even got a sympathy card in the mail with my boys paw print inside!
They really went above and beyond to make the hardest day of my life just a little bit easier. If you make the heart breaking decision to put a fur baby down I would definitely recommend them.< /text>< Pics>

To call this residential complex a 'community' would be a perversion of the word. While the amenities and on site staff drew my family here, it quickly became clear that we were paying for the performance of care and not more than that. The facilities are not always functional (beyond previous pandemic closures, i.e broken washing machines) and response to issues is non existent.<//Review>

Do you have more than one car? You should sell it before live here, they don’t offer more than one parking spot, not even if you’re willing to pay for it. Parking on the street? Forget it, you won’t find spots available after 6pm!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>One of the worst places and worst leasing team I’ve ever seen in my life. They were nasty from the moment I walked in to the moment I told them their disgusting apartments aren’t worthy of a cockroach. René was particularly horrible, steer clear at all costs.< /Review>< pics>

The good:
Average $2400 for 2 bedroom during the pandemic

The bad:
Entire building is made out of inferior material meaning different apartment residents will get annoyed if your dogs and children start making noise and playing.
No parking at all. One permit is issued and since summer house is overly crowded and in an area with other apartments, you will have to park 6/7 blocks away :(
Many unregistered dogs in the apartment. So, in case dogs get involved in incidents like fights or bite, the apartment management will do nothing at all to find the owners of the dog.
Can't reach the admin staff at the numbers listed on google and reviews. Goes to voice mailbox which will be 100% full all of the time.
Mountains of trash and furniture piled up from Sunday evening to Monday mornings.
It's smoke free apt. You can smoke freely as you wish.

Finally, trying to get my deposit back.<//text>

The worst administration that this venue can have, I have been waiting for 7 months for the deposit that I gave to be returned and to date they do not give me a reason. I call and call asking for the return of the deposit and they have a piece of their files and information, now it turns out that I owe a rent for December when my lease ended in October and I left the apartment in that month. I do not recommend this place to live.<//text>

The renovated apartments are nice (not all are renovated, though) and Alameda is just lovely, but the property management company for this apartment complex is the worst I've dealt with in 10+ years of renting.

They weren't even friendly when we signed a lease over two years ago, but that's fine. One particular guy used to go out of his way to harass kids at the pool for doing nothing. But things got much worse with COVID, as they barricaded themselves in their office and refused to answer the phones or emails. The package locker room situation turned into complete mayhem and packages were going missing, but they insisted this was because "residents weren't picking up their package" rather than acknowledging they didn't have nearly enough lockers for a place so big (the same thing would happen during the holidays). I am very sympathetic to the fact that they needed to close the office and all amenities to keep everyone safe and of course agree with that decision, but they never so much as acknowledged that we had 1.5 years of not being able to access the pool and gym, and they made themselves completely unavailable the entire duration of the pandemic.

The worst was when we tried to move out. It took weeks to get them to acknowledge our move-out notice, with repeated calls and emails left unanswered. We had to resort to sliding the letter under the leasing office door several times before we were acknowledged. Now we've moved across the country and we have yet to hear about our security deposit, which is a lot of money, and of course they aren't answering our repeated calls or emails.< /text>

The only person to answer my calls has been Deveaon, but that's not a bad thing! She was there to help every time I had a question or needed some assistance. She took the pain and struggle away from finding a new place to live. I love the geography and location of the apartments! It puts a smile on my face knowing that any worries that I might have immediately gets dissolved by the comfort of the front desk! If I lived a thousand lifetimes, I would choose to live at the summer houses every single day because of their helpful staff!</Text>

Absolutely horrible experience with this place. It’s been over 8 months since we moved out and we still haven’t received our deposit or heard back from anyone. We called a number of times and they’ve just kept saying the check will be mailed to us in a couple of days. We still haven’t heard from them or received anything in the mail, but seeing some other reviews this seems to be a pretty standard way they scam people. Not to mention the place is a nightmare, always loud, dirty in all common areas, and everyone is allowed to smoke although the complex is “non-smoking”. Avoid this place at all costs, and Summer House we’ll see you in small claims court very soon.< /text>

My car was towed unlawfully in violation of vehicle code section 22658. The notices that they said were posted were torn and shoddy and were not marked on all parking spots to which it applied. Our car was also towed outside of the stated time window. I had to pay $290 to get the car out even after serving a demand letter on the towing company for return of my car.

We weren’t the only victims of this. When we went to recover our car there were at least 6 other Summer House residents in line waiting to get their cars as well. Same story: cars towed without proper notice.

I was going let to be bygones be bygones. We just moved here and we’re still getting used to their brand of disrespect. But when my partner went to let them know about the issue they were rude as all hell and dismissive. If we don’t get refunded the towing fees we may have to chat about it on the record, in front of the Superior Court.

I knew I was onto something when I waived the arbitration clause in our lease agreement.

Welcome to Pop Copy.

Oops.

I meant, Summer House.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I have been living here for the past 2,5 years.
Unfortunately my experience is that they don't care about the residents living here, although when you come here first as a potential resident to rent an apartment, they will be very welcoming just to get you sign with them.
The only positive people working here are the maintenance team that is trying hard to solve any maintenance problems. But the people working at the leasing office are unresponsive, inattentive and will not respond to emails or phone calls for days or even at all!
I waited days to get response from Tim about my case, and then when I didn't get any response to my emails or phone calls, I had reach out to Andrea, but again she was neither helpful, neither considerate, and did not show care to resolve my issue.
What a disappointment it has been to receive no help from the leasing office when I needed one. And this has happened to me not only once but a couple of times already.
A note of suggestion for the management:
Care for the current residents the way you show care to the new potential residents touring the apartments. Make everyone inclusive and be fair, treat all people nice, after all kindness goes a long way!
This is what is lacking from this community.
And maybe this is why you are seeing so many people moving out of here because you don't respect your current residents.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1616471531073, 'text': 'Sylvia, \rThank you for bringing your experience with our office team to our attention.

My little family has settled into our lovely new apartment here at Summer House. We want to give thanks to the staff that helped us, in what turned out to be a months long move in process due to the pandemic, and living hundreds of miles away. We appreciate Andrea, Devan, Tim, and the others that were patient with us along the way. They are always friendly, answered our calls or responded to emails in a timely manner, and have been tremendously helpful.

The apartment move in date was delayed because of renovations, but it was worth the wait. The community is very friendly, with a few drawbacks of having some overly noisy neighbors at night, but that's an issue anywhere. We haven't been here too long, but are enjoying it thus far. We are happy to call this home!< /review>

I really enjoy living here. The staff and maintenance are always helpful with smiles on their face. Yesterday I called in with a maintenance issue and Kwesi quickly came to my rescue with a smile. If it wasn't for him, it would have been a long miserable day! My only complaint of these apartments is the parking. I am not going anywhere anytime soon!

My husband and I are currently looking for a 2 bedroom apartment bc our current landlord is selling his house. Luckily, we found Summer House.   Summer House location is awesome - it's far enough from the City but also has the residential feel to it.   We spoke with Tim Martinez and he totally eased our minds regarding moving during Covid times.  I can't thank him enough for his kindness.</Text>

<Name>Luis Hernandez</Name><text>If you’re somebody that likes to have everything well planned and a steady organized move in date then I don’t recommend Summerhouse, the leasing office really lack communication. They never answer a phone call, current tenents that live there and 1 lady that was moving out and where by the office have told me are you sure you want to move in here? (RED FLAG) but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt so I continued the Move in process with these people, and up until this last incident.  I’ve called them many times to try to figure out why my move in date was unknowingly pushed to a later date, I asked for the day off from work 2 weeks in advance And even scheduled a uhaul reservation, Only to receive the move in contract via email which stated move in date on the 27th without notifying me, The move in date I requested was today the 26th of March, the price changes throughout the month but on their site you can see what the monthly rates changes to if you choose a specific date and it said $2045 to move in on the 26th, the contract also stated and increased to $2,160/month.... (RED FLAG) so my fiancé went to the office yesterday and they told her that the reason the date was pushed Last minute was because there was a hole in the tub, and I was put on speaker phone and asked why didn’t they communicate that with me and the woman’s excuse was because “they just found out yesterday” but not true at all cuz I noticed the change of date like 3 days before and I was calling like 15 times a day and no answer (RED FLAG)if my fiancé had never went to the office we wouldn’t hear from them at all the lady’s excuse was because they are really busy dealing with 600 units..(RED FLAG)these people lack customer service i literally backed out of that place immediately, I know that it was only 1 day of difference but you have to communicate, because I organized a whole plan for this date. this place needs more and even possibly new employees who take the job seriously. The area is pretty nice good looking buildings, almost makes you want to ignore the terrible customer service that the leasing office has to offer. I only shared what really cut it for me which is only about 50% of my experience and the lady did not seem to care when I backed out (HUGE RED FLAG) considering there’s  a lot of vacant rooms on their site. good luck to anyone applying here!

Mislead with apartment amenities and lack of customer service with leasing staff. There’s no assigned parking and you’ll have a really hard time looking for parking. Dog feces are all over the property and sidewalks alongside the property. Roaches inside the apartment as well and they do nothing about these problems. I’ve only been here 1 month and my wall panel is falling off. Things were not properly done before I moved in. The only upside is the area is really quiet.<//review>

Great location for this property but customer service here sucks.  Service requests takes longer to get done.
Existing residents needs  and concerns are overlooked  And not addressed and always looking for ways to increase rent year after year with same existing amenities.

Calls are not returned and if the staff schedules a call appointment with you, they do not follow through and when you call, they tell you they were busy and forgot about it.

A few break ins have happened in the last couple years and complex is not doing anything to beef up security.

If you want a place with great customer service, follow through, customer retention programs, then THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.< /text>

I certainly wish I had the vocabulary to aptly describe what a pleasure it was to meet with Devann and discuss my potential living arrangements at Summer House. With the stresses of a career and family move being what they are, Devann greeted my family and I with a warm smile and a professional attitude. We left confident and well satisfied with the options available to us and truly hope to work with her again in the future! Thank you so very much, Devann, for making us feel at home!< /text>

STAY AWAY. I’d give 0 stars if I could. The laundry machines constantly break down mid-cycle. We got one of the remodeled units which looked great, but turned out to be extremely poorly done. Cabinets fall off, permanent floorboard glue tracked all throughout the unit, the list goes on and on and on. And good luck getting anyone to fix stuff- it took 7 months of complaining for them to replace our screen door which was broken before we moved in. Worst of all, we keep getting turned down for other apartments we apply to because they can’t get a hold of the Summer House leasing office. Call the office phone, bang on the door, it won’t matter. No one is going to help you. Again, STAY AWAY.</review>

My company is one of the vendors for Summer House and Alliance Residential. We have done quite a bit of work there and I have worked with the Regional Manager, Christina Gregory quite a bit. She has always been extremely helpful and friendly in our interactions and communications. This property has always been very well  maintained and Christina seems to have this site completely dialed in. Working with her and the staff there has always been a pleasure and I hope to continue our working relationship with Christina and her staff at this property.<//text>

High speed internet is not available in this complex yet.

The leasing office made a turn around with new management and has made their office more available for tenants and applicants.

This place could really use some security or at least cameras.< /Text><UserId.>107630017132106635872< /UserId.>< Response>

I am a vendor that has worked with this property for over 3 years. Every time I visit the property the leasing staff is very nice and the property is well maintained and kept up. I would live here if I was looking in the Alameda area.</review>

The apartments are decent upon first look, but the cracks start to show. I haven't experienced any parking issues since I've used public transit and my motorcycle to get around.

Pros:
Modern kitchen
Good appliances
Well kept grounds
Fair pricing
Mostly quiet
Luxer lockers (like Amazon) for packages
Nice pool
Motorcycle parking

Cons:
Bedrooms have no built-in lighting
Problematic bathroom drains
Textured paint w/ some overpaint
Dirty hallways
Seeing at least a cockroach a day
Balcony screen door does not fit or slide properly
Caulking peeling and revealing older, rotten in places caulking.

<review>5 ⭐️ for SummerHouse! I have been living at the community for a month now and have really enjoyed all my experiences. The staff has done really great through these crazy COVID-19 times and I appreciate all their efforts. The landscapers and housekeeping staff are always extremely kind when you bump into them. The windows in the living room are large and amazing! The updates are beautiful! And I absolutely love how I could use my credit card for laundry and not have to worry about carrying around quarters!! Also, I see a lot of parking issue comments - I have yet to experience those issues for myself. Keep up the great work SummerHouse! I’m looking forward to my continued residency at the community!<//review><user_name>Pat Bickmann<//user_name><time>1595448450562<//time>< Rating>

<review>Weed and cigarettes smokers even in laundry room and stairways, dirty hallways and elevators, vandalism graffiti on walls and doors, broken panels on stairways, bad sound insulation between floors and walls, and more!!! You pay the rent and still have to report about all of that to be fixed and cleaned. Poor management service ( Pinnacle Management in the past, now under a new management team by Allresco)

Update:
I was trying to reach you and speak with general manager or supervisors - it’s been a month, no response, you don’t return calls. Spoke with management and they were so “nice” promised to give me a call back. Left couple emails describing my issues - no one responded.

I would not choose to live here as long as Summer House is in contract with PPI, a predatory towing company. They look for an excuse to tow anyone, and do not care if they are a resident or not. I refuse to support Summer House as long as they employ these predatory towers that actively work against the residents.< /Text>

<Name>Zehra Sarimeseli<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures><text>I can confidently and strongly say that there is an immense negligence with respect to elevators. Different buildings have elevator problems. Specifically speaking, 457 has a long standing elevator problem. The management told about 4-6 weeks of repairing time. Let me say, it is not working since May. Carrying heavily loads from shopping, I am afraid I will have a back problem. Also, washing machines broke down. The management says “it can take a little bit longer, use other buildings’ machines” complacently. In the case big troubles like this, the management is “comfortable” and senseless towards residents’ suffering. If we think financially and fairly, we have to charge and refund some money due to lack of contract promises. No elevator...Yet, if you pay the rent a day late, you are in trouble. You will be fined daily. It should be enjoyable in managerial perspective. The buildings are generally dirty. Last one, a big tray of food left over started in front of the stairs at least three days. I mean, I cannot neglect the positive things as well, yet these are due resident communities kindness and behaviors. When we first entered the apartment, there was a non-working fridge. When we left our shoes in front of the apartment, we get “warning” but when the elevator does not work, no problem for months. Let the poor resident suffer.< /text><Response>{'time': 1549649484861, 'text': 'Hi Zehra, thank you for rating our community.

I am very happy for being a resident here at Summer House Apartments. My first contact with Kristen Alexander was pleasant. She is very professional & help use find the perfect home. She moved my family in an timely manner due to the urgency of relocating. She is good with managing her time & communicating back & forth about our application process.<//Text>

This place is not a good place to rent. Management is terrible; they don't know how to communicate with their residents; they never follow up with your issues. For the price we were paying, we had our light turn off several times  because there were issues with their electrical systems. The after hour maintenance service didn't work because they are never there; if you have a problem with maintenance you have to wait the next morning to get it fixed since nobody is there after 6pm. After we moved out, they charged us for carpet cleaning, painting and cleaning even though we clean the place. Before we moved in, they promised us a $500 visa gift card that we never got.
I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

I moved in to an apartment at summer house 2 weeks ago and so far I absolutely love it! The apartments are very nice and spacious, and the amenities are awesome! Deeba helped us through the application process and she was fabulous. She made our move in run very smoothly and was easy to reach whenever we had questions or needed help with something. I would definitely recommend summer house to anybody looking to move to Alameda.< /Review>

Do you enjoy getting woken up at 5am every morning by various car alarms?  Do you enjoy getting woken up at 1am by loud, obnoxious neighbors, their kids, or their dogs yelling and screaming?  Do you enjoy coming home late from work to find parking unavailable due to non residents taking up extra spots, along with double parking everywhere?  Do you enjoy broken glass all over the parking lots where you have to walk every day?  Do you enjoy getting mean mugged by people brown bagging and chain smoking in the parking lot right next to your car (like come on, don’t you have a better place to do that?).  If you can check all these boxes, then I guess summer house apartments is the place for you!</text>

Current resident for over 2 years, great people at the leasing office. ONLY ISSUE HERE AT SUMMER HOUSE is PARKING!!!

they dont have assigned parking space for tenants, they recently took away parking spaces and made it into emergency zone area.

On top of all of this issues they started to give out 24hr parking permits.

Just wanted to share this with future residents. "Specially if you work late like me" I hope they see this review and decide to take actions regarding this matter.< /Review>

< review>
We were ready to sign a lease with Summer House but something just didn't feel right; the lack of clarity on the refund of a $200 holding deposit, the lack of email responses from management, and trouble communicating with them, the horrible reviews about these same issues on YELP and Google, and all the added fees ($100/month for a second parking space for example). We also searched the crime report through Trulia, and found there were a high number of reported auto thefts in January 2018. Not what I wanted to see when I'd be paying $100 extra a month for a parking spot that would be in an overflow lot.

We felt like the woman who was handling our application was not on the ball, very inexperienced and not able to give us straight answers. We asked for a full refund on our deposit, including background check since we requested this within 24hrs of putting down the deposit. After much back and fourth by the management, we were finally able to get our money back. When I went to the office to pick up our check, they had a sign on the leasing office that they were closed for a mtg, with the times of closure inaccurate. There were several tenants waiting outside, who told me that "this is how they always are." I am just glad we got our money back and will not be living there.

Please also be aware, the company only accepts Cashiers checks when applying and putting down any initial deposit. My banker found this strange, as a money order and cashiers check is the same from your bank. Only a cashiers check cost $10 to issue as opposed to $5 for a money order. I was told by the same woman doing our application that this is because a money order isn't traceable and a cashier's check is. Wells Fargo seems to think it's because they don't know what they're doing.</review>

If you want an apartment staff that is capable of doing their jobs, this is NOT YOUR PLACE. The only staff members who actually do their job well are the maintenace team! They defer all work to their manager, whom seems to be more busier than THE POTUS.</text>

Do not move here. The management is not helpful once you move in and they do not keep the common areas clean.

<text>I’ve lived here for almost a year, and will not be renewing my lease. Some of the reasons are as follows: constant smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke in the building hallways, that has also frequently seeped into my apartment. I’ve tried working with the management on this issue since I moved in, but nothing has changed. There are numerous distributive residents who make the quiet enjoyment of my apartment impossible. Parking is a huge concern here. If you come home late there is little or no parking, and the parking spots are so narrow that, after 10 months here, my car has numerous door ding dents and has even been intentionally keyed in the parking lot. I’ve had a water leak that has taken over three months to get rapiers, still not fixed. Locks on the exterior building doors and the doors themselves rarely work properly, which means the building is far from secure. On that same topic, the vehicle entrance gate has pretty much been broken the entire time I have lived here. This means anyone can just wander on the property, so it’s just a constant stream of non residents parking in the lot along with non residents coming on the property to engage in what appears to be criminal activity. They recently changed security companies, and since that change I haven’t seen a single security guard. Seems they went from ineffective security to none at all. Cars frequently speed and screech tires in the parking lots, making them unsafe for pedestrians. The last straw was coming home to find a vehicle had plowed through another security gate and was abandoned on the common area grass. I don’t feel safe in this complex and will be moving out when my lease is up. When I bring up concerns to management I just get a whole lot of corporate speak, so things get done slowly, if at all. They try and cut costs at every corner, obviously hiring the lowest bidders to do repairs. The recently had some sidewalks replaced, and their contractor didn’t even use rebar in the concrete forms, so they will buckle and crack again, but cheap is cheap. So if you’re looking for overpriced unsafe housing and the constant nuisance of smoke and noise, then this is the place for you. As for me, I’ll be moving away and not coming back.< /text>< pictures>

Place is extremely crowded.  Major parking problems.  Not one visitor parking spot.  Home to predatory towing practices from PPI.  Don't go near this place,  I will call the office as I am not in the area.  Who do I ask for to address this issue/complaint.  I want the $365 reversed on my credit card please.< /text>

<review>Despite all the reviews, I decided to take a look at Summer House after unsuccessful attempts in finding affordable rentals in surrounding neighborhoods. I had lived in Alameda before AND took a look at Summer House 3 years prior. Now, I'm a resident here. I have to say that the new management has changed this place for the better. Now that construction is complete, the grounds are gorgeous with water fountains all around, a gigantic swimming pool and beautiful plants and flowers.  The groundskeepers should be given full credit, as I see them outside everyday working on keeping the place clean and attractive (*reviews have been given about the trash and furniture around the dumpsters, which is accurate still, however, this is at the fault of the residents, not the property managers). The ordinary apartments are comparable to their going rates, so if you are looking for something plain to get you through the year, this is a great spot. They come with a double sink, dishwasher, electric stove, microwave, carpeted rooms, and easy cable hookup. So far we've had to call maintenance twice in the 3 months that we've been here. Though some appliances were not working properly when we moved in, the maintenance people were there on time and fixed our problems right away... no questions asked. Be careful for the "water fee" which is divided among the complex as a whole and attached to your monthly rent. There is ample parking but the car gates are not secure. Plenty of kids here who play in the complex when school is out. We live with a 10 year-old so he made friends right away. Last note, it can get a little noisy since the walls are pretty thin. I would suggest sticking with a top floor.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>I’ve been living at Summerhouse apartments for 4 years, place isn’t perfect but it has consistently improved. That said, the new property manager is incompetent beyond belief! This place has a lot of potential if they would get rid of him. Point in case:

The complex has been having problems with fake parking passes and non residents parking in the lots. New property managers solution? Set 5hrs of time for everyone to come in with their registration to reapply. Then he was “sick” the day after St. Patrick’s day so they had to rescheduled because apparently no one else is qualified to do this task. On the Saturday they rescheduled to it was a circus with no organization. He insists to meet with everyone one on one and do everything by himself, despite people waiting HOURS to reapply for something they are already paying for.

On top of that, when pepole complained about having to waste their Saturday he tried to guilt trip everyone saying he was “sacrificing his Saturday with his kids to help us” as if this wasn’t his job.

Bottom line, this place has a lot of potential, but I have major doubts with this guy at the lead.</Text>< resp>

The apartments are not the issue with this place. The management is the issue. They are terrible. They never answer the phone. They say they don't get our rent checks, after we have physically dropped them off to them, then they decide to apply late fees for rent that is not even late. Literally every month it is an issue with them and paying my rent. They take a week to even process rent checks. They come with these random fees when we pay everything on time. If you get notices on your door, investigate before you just give them more money they claim you owe. Again, apartments are not an issue, its the management and staff. Way too unorganized for me.</Review>

<Review>Summer house apartments are a great option if you're moving into the bay. When I moved into Alameda 2 years ago I found their prices to be competitive and even though they raised my rent it's still below market value. They're dog friendly, pretty responsive, and the units themselves are on the nicer side. Everyone in my building is pretty chill and I haven't heard about any noise problems.
Cons:
- Not everyone is good with their own dog and I've seen several incidents where on-leash dogs were being really aggressive with other dogs (not the apartment's fault but it's still something to be aware of).
- We've had a few minor annoyances with maintenance but we don't call them very often.
- Sometimes non-residents will get into the habit of letting themselves into the complex. Nothing dangerous though. Example: For a few weeks a guy would use a stick every day to let himself into one of the parking lot areas and just make calls all day in front of my building. I guess it wouldn't have been an issue if he wasn't glaring at all of the residents that walked by.</Review>< user_name>

As you can see from the improvements all over the community, we work very hard to provide the best living experience for our residents. I'm very pleased that this is the case for you. I appreciate the honest feedback and what you mentioned about the dogs being off leashes & others from the neighborhood outside of our community are on the top of my list. In fact, brand new cameras are being installed around the community as we speak that will allow me to identify those at our gates easier. We are working with the local law enforcement to keep those that don't belong from coming in and impeding our quiet environment. This will also help identify those that aren't following the pet ownership rules about leashes & such.\n\nIf you have any other suggestions, please feel free to share. We appreciate your feedback!

Previous to the new management I would have recommended Summer House. Now, I wouldn't even if it were half the price. You'll never see the same face twice in the management office since turnover is outrageous. Unfortunately, that means you won't see the person that promised to fix management's mistake and you'll have to go through the whole process again. For any little thing you'll have to visit at least 3 times before it gets corrected. They lose submitted paperwork like no one I've ever seen. The managers hide from the constant influx of dissatisfied tenants.<//Review>

This place is not worth it! There is very poor follow up from the current management with issues that need attention. Poor customer service! The police are here frequently. Garbage is dumped almost daily by the overflowing trash bins. There is trash often littered in the apartment hallways. The pool is closed or broken more times than I can count. Gym equipment is broken a lot of times. The pictures they post are deceiving. Of course the business office looks nice and the units with wood flooring (wood floors cost more). Get ready for door dings and scratches and parking issues galore!The laundry rooms flood with usage and machines are broken and go unfixed for long periods of time. The payment system is a nightmare. Their accounting is a nightmare. Honestly, shop around. You can find comparable prices and not go through the hassles that occur here. Once you get in...your complaints will go nowhere, hence why people try and speak up online. Don't do it!< /Review>

Yes, this is a very large community that requires a lot of hard work to keep up the beautiful atmosphere. Our dedicated team of 15 employees work tirelessly every day to keep the grounds clean and all of our amenities in operation. We know that things may break down from time to time but have always taken the necessary steps to get them repaired right away.\n\nI also see you have other frustrations that I would like to address for our readers. We have a great relationship with the police department so yes, they do make their presence known at our community. The pool was upgraded top-to-bottom last year but has been open daily since last fall. May of our residents love the new pool furniture, heated water & bb-q pits. Out of our 24 laundry rooms on site, you can imagine that some machines may malfunction. We work closely with our laundry machine company to have them serviced quickly and there are always other laundry rooms available. The online payment system has been great success and a huge part of our effort to save trees by becoming as paperless as possible. As for the online reviews, we ask for our residents feedback with regular surveys sent from a third party that verifies reviews are from real Summer House residents. This feedback is used for planning ways to improve both our customer service as well as the physical attributes of our community.\n\nI welcome you to contact me directly so we can talk in person about these matters and share some of our planned improvements.

If I could give this place 0 stars, then I would. It is impossible to get anyone on the phone and when you do they promise to call you back the same day, but they never do. I have been trying to end my month to month lease and am not able to speak with anyone who can help me. I'm not available during office hours so I can't just drop in. I will definitely be reporting them to the BBB. Don't waste your time and money with this terrible place.<//Review>

From these reviews it seems to have gotten worse. Hands down, this was the worst place I've ever lived! Inadequate parking, poorly maintained, thin walls, rude staff, selectively enforce rules, extra charges when you move out (...doesn't matter how well you clean it).

Honestly the biggest problem is lack of parking space. Second is maintenance. All the inside common areas are gross. Third redo the insulation in the walls or something. Then again... A better solution is just to tear the whole damn thing down.< /text>< Pictures>

Never returned my deposit! They are crooks over there. Do not rent there. I have a mind to stand outside there leasing door and show everyone what they did and do to their tenants. Took over 4,000 deposit from us after a clean move out. They blamed the old management. As if that even helps the situation or releases them from the responsiblity? They claimed they would figure it out. Never did. Called back few times. They let it ring off the hook-never answer. So they have a lawsuit coming. They will regret stealing I'll take away their licenses. So Unethical! Strongly advise anyone thinking about moving here to think again. Theres way better places that have ethics unlike this place.

Worst apartment complex my family and I have ever lived in. A bad experience because of a variety of issues, such as terrible maintenance, high rent and high fees, greedy over-valuation of the property's worth, high crime and nonexistent security, as well as the fact that they are slowly pricing out even families who make $100k/year. Summer House has made it too expensive to justify renting from them while also making it exceedingly difficult to move out due to rapid rent increases of as much as $200/month, huge penalties for breaking a lease early, etc. Avoid at all costs. Contact me personally for greater detail, if needed.</review>

It is unfortunate they can still get people to rent here and pay the outrageous prices they charge, simply because they are in Alameda.
They continue to promote the good workers and managers out of here into other properties so nothing improves.
People screaming in the courtyards, trash everywhere, graffiti, and punks scoping out cars in the parking lot to break into.

When we moved in, fire alarms 3 times a week for the first month. No kidding, no exaggeration.

Called to let the office know the power was out in the kitchen, and my fridge and freezer were warming. They did nothing but string me along for 6hrs before telling me they were not going to fix it until the next day. The management determined it wasnt an emergency.
I am currently looking for a new apartment for when this lease ends.
*I would HIGHLY discourage you from renting here!*</review>

Britnie from the leasing office is great! She has been very helpful and is always there to assist me! As far as maintenance, I really had no problem with them! They are quick to respond to all my maintenance needs. Security on the other hand needs improvement. For such a big compound, I think they should increase staff at least 1-2 more security staff patrolling the area instead of 1. Entrance and exit gates should always be closed, not like this weekend, exit gate on Buena Vista Avenue was open the entire weekend. :)</text>

I love everyone at the office... Especially Britnie. However... Ive only been here 2 months and the elevator has been down for 3 days now. They replaced the washers and dryers, but who installs 3 washers and only 2 dryers in a room? Now i have to play guard so security doesnt lock up my laundry that i started 3 hours ago because i had to get in line.

To be fair... I see improvements happening, but wow they are slow.  There are a lot of little things that they could definitely put more effort into improving faster... Gates, paging systems, treadmills, garbage all over the place, etc.  I pay way too much rent to have to deal with some of the crap that i do deal with.< /Review>

DONT GIVE DEPOSIT-THEY WONT RETURN IT! They took over 4k deposit that I have receipt and proof of giving them the check and they withdrawed it & at end of lease- never returned the money after move out. Spotless moveout/no damage. They claim the previous managment have the money and they would take care of it. Well guess what? They never took are of it. Never called back. Never pick up my phone. DOESNT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR. I'm sure there are many bad reviews to follow with this kind of management running or should I say RUNING the place.</Text>

The inside of the apartments are nice except for the heater that you have to shout over to hear each other. The problem is the unsafe complex. The "security" doors to all the apartment buildings never lock, so anyone can enter your building, plus people prop the perimeter gates open with sticks. If the complex would look at the bushes along the gate on Buena Vista they will see all the branches people break off to do this. I've talked to the office and they say there is nothing they can do, and the one security guard at night walks by people smoking weed, does nothing about the propped open doors, and spends more time on his cell phone than checking out the complex. Live here if you don't mind being in the ghetto of Alameda. There are plenty of other apartments that actually give you what you pay for.</Text>

I am not a resident, but a boyfriend of tenant. I have never seen a more unprofessional and unsafe complex in all of my life. The amount they are asking to rent  these apartments for, are not even close to the value you get. The 2 bedrooms should be 1300 not 2000. Grounds and amenities are unkept. Rodent issues are out of control. DO NOT RENT HERE..... Especially building 433.< /Text>

This place is sad even with the new management. They charged me $50 bucks for a key to the apartments that i got made at Safeway down the street for $3.50. if you loose your key dont pay them just go make a new one in the machine 5 min away. i tried to return it and they gave me some sad story that they already ordered a new one and it cost so much money and they already cashed my check. This is a joke in one day you cant return the key with a receipt. On top of everything the guy in the front was very rude and talked down to me. The apartments are ok but this new  management is no better then the last. DON'T GET RAPED AND PAY $50 bucks! make a copy for much cheaper. Also they dont tell you this on the craigslist adds but you also pay for water and garbage broken down between all the units and that adds an extra $105 to you bill every month if you have 2 people living in the house.</Review>

< Review>
It was a bad omen when I went to the bank for a cashier's check for rent and deposit, and the teller told me I should tear it up find a new place if I hadn't signed anything yet.  These have been my negative experiences in the one year I have lived here:

1. My roommate and I voiced concern over parking on the tour.  Our guide said, "The 3 bedroom apartments come with 2 spaces."  This is an outright lie. The excuse: "Oh, sorry, he is new here."

2. We were told the prices of the apartments are all reflected on the website.  We applied for our apartment based on website listing, and then the contract was for $200 more per month.  Their excuse was, "Sometimes there's a significant delay between the website updates and actual rent changes, especially during the summer when there are a lot of moves."

3. After signing a lease for $200 more than expected and one fewer parking space, a new blank lease appeared in our email  a month later asking for even more money.  They said there was an error, and we weren't being charged enough.  They didn't push it after we pointed out this was blatantly illegal, but they still act like they're doing us a huge favor and we're just trying to scheme them out of cash.

4. There is a significant amount of noise at night.  I was particularly peeved one night when a car with a custom engine and very loud after stock muffler was parked below my window at 1:30 AM just revving the engine over and over again.  Then the guy left the doors open on both sides and BLASTED his stereo.  I was going to call security, but when I looked again, I saw that it was the security guard.  I had to be at work 5 hours later.

5. Management is in cahoots with some local towing company, and they call them immediately if anything is amiss.  If you need to unload groceries because you don't have enough parking spots that come with the apartment, you're gambling if it will be there when you return, even if it's only 10 min.

6. People like to dig through the dumpster below my bedroom window on a daily basis, and they can be rather loud at times, too.

7. There are loud children everywhere.  Make sure your apartment isn't next to the parking lot or the playground.

8. You are next to 2 schools, which is convenient if you have kids, but a pain around 8AM and 3PM.

9. There's a creepy old guy in the complex across the street who just walks up and down the sidewalk and calls police for people who are parked illegally, even if you tell him you just need to run a bag of groceries upstairs before you hunt for parking elsewhere.

Basically, I should have listened to my bank teller.  I'm moving in a week, and I can't wait.<//Review>

Later after 2 years I found out 5K charge was applied under collection in my credit history. I tried calling couple of times for copy of my relieving letter and got no response.Collection agency they work with are very rude and uneducated.

I really liked living here. Here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
- Management office: People in the management office are very nice and helpful. I did not deal with all of them (they look very nice though), but I usually talk to Britnie, she is very very nice girl and very helpful. Always optimistic :)
- Price: Apartment price was very nice especially if u work in SF, though they require very good credit, and relatively high income to be able to live there
- Maintenance: They respond very quickly, usually less than 24 hours
- Facilities: Swimming pool, Gym, playground for kids, barbecue area
- Security: Place has gates and security guards at night.
- unit: has microwave and dishwasher
- Commute: bus station is 5 mins walk. 25 minutes Bus to SF, 5 mins to Oakland.

Cons:
- Washers are very good, but dryers were not that great. However, I knew that they will have pretty new washers/dryers on January 2016
- Sometimes, you hear people's footsteps above you, but its okay for me.
- Carpet in my apartment was not that new.<//Review>

Starting out, we moved here bc we were in a time crunch moving from a different city. Upon moving in there were several issues with the gates, parking, different issues with our apartments and rude management. The management was since been switched within the past 6ish months and is 100% better. New paint, parking lot and dumpster improvements, new hardwood floor in our apartment to replace the old carpet. We called for a simple light bulb problem in our bathroom, and they brought an entire new light fixture that was definitely an upgrade to fix the problem. The staff now is completely amazing and very quick to fix and help in anyway they can. Only reason its not a 5 is because I come from a town where you get what you pay for and this being such an expensive complex with all the upgrades (which are beautiful), i would Just like to see more patio or outside space or newer play equipment for the kids.< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Attention Marcus Thomson  and  staff, not too comfortable paying rent online in October 2016. My husband and I had some worst past experiences going online  and do not want to have nightmares about it again. Read reviews about money grams, too and they are the worst of them all. Too many hackers and scammers on the internet and it isn't safe and secure to go online at all.  We don't trust it at all.  You and your staff will be held responsible if anything worst happen to our rent online in October 2016.

{'time': 1472230305297, 'text': "Hello port scales,\n\nThis is Marcus Thomson from the leasing office. Thank you for reaching out to us about your concerns over paying your rent online. I understand that change can be a little unsettling to some but we strongly feel that moving to online rent payments is not only safer in may ways but also good for the environment as it greatly reduces paper use. A variety of payment options are available including online checking account payments, credit cards and Money Gram wires directly into your account. I'd love to speak with you more, help answer your questions and perhaps settle some of your worries. You can reach me at (510) 521-0822 or SummerHouse.CD@fpimgt.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarcus Thomson\nCommunity Director"}< /Response>

<Text>I went to take a tour of the facility tonight and had to give all kinds of information to even make an appointment with warnings about calling if I was going to miss it. I show up at the correct time, and everyone had left. After staring at me for a while, a maintenance man came over and asked what I was doing. I explained and he walked away. I followed him after a while and he said that he called Jeremiah and Cynthia with no response, they just decided to leave early and not call me, a potential tenant. I thought the place looked extra ghetto anyway and you could hear people screaming from the courtyard so it wasn't a huge loss. Just a huge waste of time. I'm not sure where they got the pictures on their broken website, it's much crappier in person.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>This place is highly disappointing. Tons of screaming unsupervised kids running around and almost run me over with there scooters.  The trash bins are constantly filthy with people moving out and abandoning furniture, beds, couches. The gate has not worked for months and so I am locked out on a daily basis until someone comes through. The grounds are pretty dirty, the halls reek of pot.

There are a lot of people who park in the parking lot during the weekend who are not residents and it fills up the lot, so no room for paying residents. They  need to enforce the parking rule more efficiently.

They are taking  advantage of the market right now. They are charging outrageouse  prices but are not providing the service nor quality they are charging for.

***I see that managment has responded to my review - the obnoxious loud noise is not just becuase of the Labor Day Holiday, it is a constant battle.< /review><name>Susan Zaragoza<//name>< rating>

I have been lived here for last 3 years. Im just waing for a new place as soon as posible. but life keeps me busy on other things. I cannot wait to get out of here.
I live on third floor right next to the laundry room.
The apartment patrol guys need to check every building and make sure no one uses the laundry room after 10pm. Laundry room supposed to be locked after 10 pm. Apartment patrol guys have stopped checking on it for last 2years. every night everyone using laundry room in midnight. They dont care.  some teenager smoking marijuana in the laundry room I have called police many times.

I have called the leasing office to report this matter several times. unfortunately they are not even seemed concerning this issue. Once my neighbor arrested right in front of my hall way. No explanination or anything.

Just don't live here.< /Review>

the BBB® - Better Business Bureau website. It's great that the information is posted here for all to see, but FPI Management is the Management company that is managing this complex. FPI Management has an A+ rating on the BBB site and that must change. Summer House Apartments has an F rating and the management company should have one also. Please help changing FPI Managements rating to an F rating

Thank you for sharing your opinion of Summer House on Google Reviews. Our mission is to provide excellent housing for the residents living here at one of Alameda's most desirable communities. I'm sorry that your experience hasn't been the best. I would love to speak with you more about your wait for the parking permit. We haven't had a period where permits were on order for any extended period of time. I see your lease was arranged through another company. We provide one parking permit per household at move in. Is it possible that the other company may have had your permit? In either case, I would love to talk with you and see what you feel we could do differently in the future. Please stop by or give me a call at (510) 521-0822. I am usually in the office Monday - Friday until 4:00 PM and look forward to hearing from you. Again, thank you for taking the time out of your day to share your thoughts.\n\nGratefully,\n\nMarcus Thomson\nCommunity Director\nSummer House Apartments"}</response>< date>

My kiddos all like going to the park close to home.  I just wish everyone would pick up after their pets and themselves. To continue enjoying this park we all need to help keep it a clean and safe place to go enjoy family time.</review>

This is a nice little urban park.  Pretty easy to get to, and a lot of open grass to run around in.  There's a small playground for kids and some drinking fountains.  The bad part are the gross port-o-potties that probably haven't been replaced in a decade.  Other than that, it's nice.< /text>

Fun play equipment for the kids and plenty of room to run around. My only wish is that there was a fence to help keep children from running into the street.</text>

Not only could they magically come up with a beautiful hard to find Tippman M4 22, but also a source for an obscure sear/extractor for a 1930's Winchester 60a. So hats off to everyone at Coyote Point Armory for sure like family, and would recommend highly.< /text><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808f9d95320c741f:0xdc13c9efc00ef679< /GmapID>< date>

<review>Went here because it was the closest place to my current Construction job
I have a non roster gun, being from AZ, anf in wasn't expecting much.  The kid, Because i know he was younger then me,  was cool and rwspectful when asking my name and number in case i wanted ro wait in my car for my turn in the store. Upon going upstairs i asked a gentleman. Because i have no idea who he was, ca about getting a holster for my h&k p30l. He informed me that they have one fir a p30 but since the bottom was open it might fit.  He then asked me if i had my sidearm. When i told him i had it in my car he told me ti make sure it was unloaded and cleared snd bring it in ti check the fit.  It fit.  He then proceeded to instruct me on the installation of the holster on the various attachments to make drawing more comfortable.

I am satisfied beyond belief.  Especially considering all the negative reviews.  These people were honest and helpful.< /review>< Rate>

<review>These guys are great! Don’t understand the bad reviews... Got my first handgun and AR (tho on preorder) here. Camille administered my FSC test & took care of all my paperwork, answered all my questions in a friendly welcoming manner, despite being a complete noob. On my 2nd visit this past week, both Camille & Scotty got me squared away with very first rifle order! I couldn’t be any happier (well, I could, once I finally get my AR15 and practice 😉) But yeah, these guys and this place rocks! They’ll take care of ya the right way 👍🏽😎🙌🏽< /review>< user_name>

<text>i’m a first time gun owner and here is where i purchased my very first handgun. during the pandemic, it was really tough to find a store that has the exact gun that you are looking for. i searched all over the bay and nobody has a glock 19 and if a store has it, they overpriced it waaaay too much. not exaggerating but some really do try to sell them for $1000-$1500. We stumbled upon Coyote Point Armory and gave them a call and like a stroke of luck they have 19s and no they did not mark it up like crazy! the purchase was straight up by the book. This place really deserves a 5 but ill take 1 star off because the wait times are ridiculous at times and if you are a noob, it’s kinda intimidating to ask questions because you get sarcastic response. but overall, this is a great place to purchase a firearm from. i even recommended them to my cousin who also happen to be a first timer and he was able to get a G17 with factory night sights.<//text>< pictures>

<rate>1</rate><review>This place is a scam don't do business with them. If you pass the background they make 150 plus on the sale if your unlucky and don't pass they charge you 150 restocking fee then get to resell the gun and make another 150 off the sale. They are in the Business of doing background checks not selling guns. Be aware !!
And your response is full of misinformation the 150 overstock fee was for nothing more than giving me a suggestion you ordered nothing and by law you never sold the gun to me since I didn't pass so there for you can't charge a restocking fee for something I've never ordered or touched but nice try. Your not 2nd admenment your a greedy rude disorganized small mom and pop shop. laughable after you cash in on the pandemic I'm sure karma will close your doors😂😂.
P.S. I got my money back thank God for fraud protection!!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1590113900791, 'text': 'There is most definitely a restocking fee as posted on our wall and on your receipt for prohibited people who try to buy a gun.\nNext time, try submitting a PFEC through the State.

<Review>I visited the store two or three times in recent months and found the man and woman working there to be attentive, friendly and very helpful.  I went back last week and there was third guy working there who was condescending and borderline rude. They should keep him in the back away from customers.</Review>< Pictures>

Well I was in the market for an AR, it just seemed the guys, not all of them, but some, felt bothered. Now theses guns are expensive, I want to see inside, and outside the gun. " NOPE , we don't open up rifles here" you kidding me??? The inside of the AR is key, like buying a car and you can't see the engine. So I went and spent $1600 on a AR on the other side of the freeway, ouch! They were glad to tap the knuckle bolt and open, and explain, the rifle, and show me what I was getting. Dude, your selling guns, have fun, that's a great job! Don't seem so bitter. But like I said, not all of the employees were like that. Nice shop though, bunch of cool stuff.<//Text>

GREAT PLACE!! Always enjoy supporting privately owned gun shops. Read some negative comments about the place, but decided to find out for myself.
ALL WRONG! If you want warm fuzzies go to a place where staff is forced to do it. These guys are genuine. Although I didn't need anything I bought a box of .45 COLT, and M-Pro 7(stuff works great!)to support the privately owned shops.
Thanks again for shooting the jargon with me. (No pun intended),<//text>

I'm not sure about all the negative reviews but I had a great experience there today and I didn't even buy anything! We should all be happy places like this still exist in the not-so-gun-friendly Bay Area. I was there to do a PPT for some bulk ammo. It was $5 and the process was cheap and painless. Guy behind the counter knew the process and was efficient. After that we stayed for 30+ minutes to BS about guns, trucks, racing baja and precision shooting matches. I’ll be back for my next firearms purchase. They also have a good selection of ammo and are close the the Coyote Point gun range so you can pick up some ammo if you're out.</Text>

In general rude and gruff  a bit disappointed I went here to begin with. Go with Peninsula Tactical in San Bruno. The prices are cheaper and the staff is actually happy to help as opposed to the owner of this shop.

Addition: I love the mantra of this shop. Everytime someone leaves a negative they must automatically be lying or paid by someone else. I completely understand why they are the lowest rated gun store on the peninsula.< /review>

These guys are great, very knowledgeable and accommodating.  I am a picky shopper and anyone that can put up with me deserves 5 stars.  The pricing is set very competitively and the purchase process is smooth and efficient (unlike big box stores where you take a number, wait an hour, then spend two hours just trying to buy something, then three hours trying to pick up your gun... LOL).  These guys set me up for my last hunting trip with a beautiful Kimber rifle and scope,  I had some doubts about the setup they recommended - but WOW!  This is now one of my favorite rifles!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Just got my first piece today. I am a happy customer.

I disagree with many of the other negative reviews. Despite being a first time buyer with lots of silly questions, Joaquin was friendly and professional the whole time and answered all my questions. I was told what the total amount would be before making the purchase. I Took the FSC at CP, and was given the certificate immediately. Just got the correct product at the promised price today after the mandatory ten day holding period. The whole process was smooth and predictable, and I was treated with respect.

To those who complain about these guys not being willing to administer the FSC to non-buying customers, why would you take the test if you are not buying? In other words, isn't it the same to take the test when you ARE ready to purchase? The end result is the same (unless for some reason you fail the test) because you are immediately given the certificate. I agree with Coyote Point's policy because their main function is to sell firearms, not to administer tests.</Review>< pics>

I support this local gun shop. I've received my safety cert here also brought my dad for his. He and I have purchased many rifles here.
The owners are very friendly. Through converstions we've had I found we had a connection his wife's origin. I've laughed sharing stories and have been invited on hunts but have yet to accept.
I live 5 minutes away using back streets. Not many people in California can say they have a neighboorhood gun shop. I've seen the owner crossing the street in front of my house.
If you exect the best prices start 50 miles away from SF imagine owning a business in the bay area.
I don't know the owners names but I will continue to shop here as I value them being a local small business.<//Review>

<text>Everytime I go in here these guys are really RUDE and act like jerks. They act like i'm stupid just for showing up. Ive gone in a few times over the past couple months to see if I want to spend my money there, and to see if things would change, they didn't not even after making a few purchases, they were RUDE and jerky every time.
Ive realized these guys dont deserve my money and I can't wait to leave once one of these guys starts to speak. I hate to support people like this. I see why they work at a gun store,  who else would keep people like that around. Buy your ammo online its cheaper and comes with less derogatory attitude.  WORST GUN STORE AROUND!!!</text>< pictures>

Asked about price and they said they were very competitive, so I purchased AR as they told me I could not find the AR cheaper, but after buying and looking around, realized I overpaid by about $80, not a huge deal, but these guys are not very competitive on their pricing. On a positive note, their paper work process is very efficient.</review>

<Text>I highly recommend this office! I was afraid of going to the dentist and they make me feel so comfortable and explain everything. They will always let you know what they will do and also give you prices before hand so there are no surprises. The office has outstanding communication, I am busy and prefer to text and they always respond. Thank you so much Dr.Mimi and staff! Ps. They put on Netflix for you and the office is the cutest and cleanest I've ever seen.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

So happy to have discovered Dr. Mimi and her office. I have had nothing but great experiences here. The difference between this office and my previous dentist is like night and day. My fear of the dentist is gone knowing that Dr. Mimi and the rest of her staff will be taking care of my teeth from now on.<//Text>

Everyone who works here is extremely helpful, happy, and professional. Dr Mimi was able to address underlying issues i was unaware of, educate me on them, and come up with a plan to get my oral health back on track. I have nothing but confidence in her and her team, it also doesn’t hurt that they have a coffee bar while you wait and Netflix while you get your teeth cleaned.</Text>

Dr Mimi is not only the best dentist I’ve ever been to. She’s kind and sweet and makes you feel very comfortable. Nothing better than getting your teeth cleaned while watching Netflix! Thank you so much, Dr Mimi!!</review>

As always, 10 star review for Dr Mimi and her staff.
Office staff are so professional and respectful. Dr Mimi offers painless care and is so very through. I have recommended her practice to all my friends and relatives.
The lavender scented cool washcloth at the end of any proceedure is surely the icing on the cake.
The office has a spa like ambiance and Dr Mimi has all of the state of the art equipment and technology.
Covid awareness and precautions are followed to an tee. They even text you when you can come up to office to maintain social distancing.
You'll wonder why you didn't discover this amazing practice sooner.😁< /text>

<Review>Dr. Mimi and her staff run one of the most technologically advanced dental offices that I've ever seen. She, as well as her front office staff, hygienists and assistants, are all experts in their craft. During my first visit they took 2D and 3D images of my teeth, and it was really cool to experience the benefits of these advanced systems. Dr. Mimi is highly personable, knowledgeable, and I wanted to share my positive experience so you know that visiting the Dentist can be fun!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>First visit as a new client to Dr. Mimi's office after taking a year off from dental care. I was thoroughly impressed with the office, staff and the services, which included a cleaning and a tooth repair. Customer comfort is a priority and procedures were well-communicated. Looking forward to my next visit there in a couple of weeks.</Review>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Highly recommend!! Dr Mimi is incredibly skilled and kind. I think it’s common to not enjoy going to the dentist or having anxiety, especially if you’ve had bad experiences in the past, but Dr Mimi is so gentle and kind, your anxiety will melt away. Westlake Smile Studio is easily accessible with very easy parking (no ridiculous medical bldg parking rates) parking is FREE. The office is beautiful and exceptionally clean!! They also follow the top sanitizing practices to make sure everyone is safe during covid. I love the soft and cozy blankets they offer patients during their visit, as they are so comforting and soothing, again minimizing any and all stress and anxiety. Dr Mimi has such a gentle touch, the best I’ve had and I have more than 12 root canals!! She’s extremely knowledgeable and is always happy to explain and help her patients understand their procedure or options. State of the art equipment and technology makes your appointment as easy as possible and being able to watch Netflix during your exam is definitely a bonus!! Thanks Dr Mimi for helping me with all of my root canals, root canal replacements, fillings and TMJ relief!!! -JLee<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Having moved here from the Bay area, I do not have a permanent dentist yet and was rather apprehensive with my first visit as I picked this office based on reviews plus this was the first one that I called where I was able to connect with a live person right away and even better, they were able to accommodate a same day appointment given my emergency situation.  My experience was so pleasant from the friendly staff in the reception area, to the dental technician and Dr. Mimi herself.  Dr. Mimi is really nice, very professional, knowledgeable and thorough.  Overall, it was a very good experience and I'm glad I found this dental office.<//text>

I also really loved the decor of chandeliers, tv screens and the blankets they offer you in case you're chilly!!!  It really does not feel like your typical stale dentist office... They made me want to stay there all day! It's like going to the spa! Even my kids did not want to leave the dentist office! I think her office is adults only though :)  Dr. Mimi is very kind, patient, gentle, knowledgeable and honest. Her staff and assistants are also amazing. I highly recommend Dr. Mimi at Westlake Smile Studio,  I wished she has always been my dentist! I cannot wait to go back next time to get my teeth whitened by her!</Review>< resp>

The most detailed and thorough examination I’ve gotten at a dentist.
Dr. Mimi sure knows everything you wanna know about your teeth.
Had the most pleasant teeth whitening Zoom experience. No pains and my teeth are the whitest they have ever been. My teeth cleaning was probably one of the best experience as well. My hygienist was super gentle and thorough with my teeth.
And super kind and professional office staff!!!

Thank you so much Westlake Smile!!!</text>

This was my first visit and I have to say I was very pleased from the moment I walked in to the time I left. I was met by Mimi herself, who was very nice and welcoming. The office was very new, warm and modern feeling and a pleasing staff. Her assistant made me feel very comfortable and made the time pass quickly. I found my new dentist for here on out.
Thank you Mimi and your wonderful staff!</review>

<time>1589992913134<//time><review>Dr. Mimi is extremely caring, attentive, and solution oriented for her patients. She is also very personable and makes you feel completely welcome and at ease. I recently saw her first for a zoom tooth whitening treatment which did wonders and she just fixed a cap on my tooth that a previous dentist had done that was not only the wrong color but also the wrong size and didn't match the other tooth. She did a great job fixing.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I have been coming to Smile Studio for more than a year now. I am writing because it is always helpful to me to read reviews in order make informed decisions.  Dr Mimi is impeccable. I have a lot of work done now, from removing  lots of old mercury fillings , removal of two infected root canals to be replaced with titanium implants, partial porcelain crowns and regular fillings. I am so please and very happy I found her. She always takes the time to explain all my options, and the patient to answer all my question. She is fast , cool, and fun, it makes the whole dental experience a breeze. I have visit  a lot of different dentist in my life, so I can appreciate the difference.
Her staff is amazing too, friendly and kind, and to that add top of the line equipment, and a place that looks more like a spa than a dentist office.
My smile is improving greatly, and also my health. So So please, with Dr Mimi. I highly recommend her place.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80e824efca3a9d51:0xf1420527d83c55cd< /gmap_id></record>

I loved going to Dr. Mimi for both my cleanings and getting veneers! The office is extremely modern and clean. I love the convenience of being able to text with them to book appointments, asks questions, and check in. The veneer process was very smooth and after a few months I’m so happy with my decision to choose Dr. Mimi. She is extremely thorough and detailed and went out of her way to make my smile perfect. It was definitely worth every penny!</Text>

Dr. Mimi and her lovely team, are impeccable in their practices, such as scheduling, accommodations, reminders, timeliness, and transparency in services and costs. The office is immaculate - modern, yet warm - and great care has been taken to ensure the personal comfort and safety of clientele. Dr. Mimi has an incredible eye for detail, she listens carefully, you can trust her aesthetic sense, she is gentle, her hands craft magic, and her work is flawless.
I genuinely enjoy visiting, the warmth of the team, and the ambience Dr. Mimi has curated.<//text>

This whole team at Dr. Mimi’s office is bright and shiny, just like my teeth when I leave! Ok, that was cheesy but seriously... Very authentically personable and a well-oiled machine that doesn’t keep you long in the office and makes your time there as pleasant as can be! Dr.Mimi and the hygienists there really know their stuff and always educate me throughout the process-even just at cleanings. I’d give them more than 5 stars if I could.<//text>

<text>I’ll publicly admit I’m not the best patient. I have some anxiety about visiting the dentists office. So thank god for Dr. Mimi for making it as incredibly comfortable as humanly possible. On top of being easy going and very kind, the office has high end tech as far as what I’ve seen, plus they let you watch Netflix while they work so that helps. Check it out, probably the best sort of dentist you can find anywhere.</text>< Pictures>

Mimi is absolutely amazing! The office is beautiful, the staff is friendly, and Mimi truly took the time to hear me out with any concerns I had and did absolutely everything in her power to help make me feel comfortable and reassured me that everything will be alright! Love it here!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Mimi at Westlake Smile Studio is fantastic. The office is clean, beautifully appointed and the staff professional and conscientious. You are treated like a VIP the minute you walk through her door. Our family of six are all patients and we would never consider going to anyone else.< /text>< user_id>

<Text>Dr. Mimi was gentle, easy to talk to, and so very thorough. Her and her office staff are incredibly professional and I've never felt so at ease at the Dentist! It's like a spa—definitely not clinical and cold like so many medical settings. Highly recommend!< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Dr Mimi is the best dentist I have ever had. Going to the dentist is one of my least favorite things to do and she somehow makes it a very easy and enjoyable. And they provide Netflix during your visit so I just laughed my way through an episode of the office and went home which definitely helped. If you need perfect work done at a place that makes you feel comfortable, then I don’t think you need to search any further. I wish people would be this forward and direct when I’m searching for food and need to know whether it’s good or not. No one has time to be catfished or lied to. So congrats, I just saved all you guys time looking for a dentist.</text>< Pictures>

Having been a long time patient of Dr Mimi, I can say that the care receive
from her has been outstanding.  An example:  I have a growth in my mouth that worried me until Dr Mimi explained what it was and assured me that there was nothing to worry about.  My husband is also a patient of hers.

Dr Mimi was in Thailand when my husband tripped and fell on his face,
causing injury to his jaw and 3 front teeth.
Never-the-less, she guided us to the right specialists and we were able to
get the care he needed right away.
She also made an appointment to see him on her first day back to work.
The whole ordeal was so much easier with her help (from Thailand).

The above accident was supposed to be covered by insurance but the claim was denied.  Dr Mimi offered to write a letter from a medical point of view, in hopes of a more favorable conclusion.  Regardless of the outcome, her offer of assistance was so nice of her.  But that's who she is.<//text>

I have been going to Dr. Mimi Theerathada for a couple years now and I am so incredibly happy with her services. The office is beautifully decorated and you are always greeted so warmly by Katie at the front desk. Each patient room has a TV that swings down for your Netflix pleasure so you can get comfy. In addition, they have the softest blankets that they pull out if it's a little chilly or if you ask. I have lost track of how many people from my office go to her and for good reason! She is amazing and her staff is equally amazing. I highly recommend going here for all of your dental needs.< /Review>

BEST DENTIST EVER!!!! I have been putting off going to the dentist for years; and now having been to this office, I don't know why I waited so long.  Dr. Mimi is so amazing! She made sure that I was always comfortable from start to finish (which included watching my favorite shows on Netflix while getting my dental work done). She is so talented, my smile never looked so beautiful! I also wanted to mention her staff; they are incredibly kind and knowledgeable. I am so grateful to have found this office!!!<//Review>

Went for my quarterly cleaning and always impressed with their new equipment. Got my teeth scanned, and Dr. Mimi was able to show me a 3D image of my teeth and the wear and tear it goes through, which I thought was really cool. She also lasered some nastiness out of my areas of bone loss I couldn’t floss or brush very well. My, has time and dentistry changed.</Review>

<text>My previous dentist moved her practice to Pasadena some time ago so I had been look for a new dentist  nearby. My son, who had recently been treated by Dr. Theerathada recommended  Westlake Smile Studio. I had not been to a dentist in a long time due to my own 'dental philosophy' which is  'floss, brush, floss, and brush some more but If it doesn't hurt, keep the dentists at bay'. What can I say? I guess I am not a dental hypochondriac.Ok, maybe I have a slight case of dentophobia combined with trypanophobia. Anyway, I finally chipped one of my teeth recently and decided it was time to meet Dr. Theerathada (known affectionately as Dr.mimi). Well, as I feared, my x-rays looked like it could be used in dental schools as an exhibit "A" on what can go wrong if you see synchronize your dental visits to our  Presidential election cycle.
Nonetheless, Dr.mimi gently explained how I can restore my dental health in a logical step by step manner without any drama.
Her whole staff, including  her outstanding receptionist  Katie was as nice as they can be. I don't start my treatments until next week so I can't comment on her dental work  but all in all, I am glad I came to WSS and will keep posting as my treatments progress.< /text><time>1560956000737<//time><username>Milton Kim</username>< pictures>

If it was possible to give this garbage zero stars, I would. As an event planner I have worked w/ hundreds of venues all over the country. Never in my professional career has my team booked a venue only to have the space cancel eight days before production. Joey is a liar. There's no admin, no real phone number and not one ounce of professionalism. These guys operate out of a literal storage unit with a ring crammed in. I'm not sure how its possible for a business as shady as this one to have an average of 4 star reviews. Do yourself a favor - don't waste your time or your energy.< /review>

Best choice for my corporate event!!  As an event planner, using a vendor for the first time can always be a little nerve -racking but Silvia at Santino Bros. completely put me at ease from the moment I spoke with her.  I research three other companies before I found Santino Bros. All which quoted an obscene amount for what we wanted.  I couldn't believe how professional the set up was.  Not only did they bring in a professional ring, they brought announcers, refs, lighting, music, commentators etc. I was literally blown away.  Their wrestlers were top notch and the story lines for each of them were theatrical and entertaining. Our company wanted a WWE style event this year and I can only hope that they would want it every year because it was so fun.  Thanks Santino Bros and Silvia. You made my event a huge success.  I can't thank you enough.<//text>

<review>This training facility is home to one of the top wrestling curriculums in the nation, bar none. After joining in July of 2014, I spent the better part of 2 years training, learning, and perfecting the art of professional wrestling through the guidance of trainers such as Robby Phoenix, Los Luchas (PWG, international fame) and Joey Kaos (XPW fame). Thanks to their regimen, I have now graduated and am one year in wrestling on the independent circuit. I have wrestled for renowned promotions such as Championship Wrestling from Hollywood, Future Stars of Wrestling, All Pro Wrestling, and WrestleCircus. I am grateful that because of the dedication and commitment to each student I have been able to succeed with every opportunity put in front of me.

The prosperity I have reached because of Santino Bros goes beyond training and performing in the ring. I have made the most progress and growth as a person with the rapport and relationships I have built with my trainers and classmates. This little warehouse in Bell Gardens is my home away from home and I know that many other wrestlers feel the same way.

Thank you to Santino Bros, Sylvia Munoz, Mongol Santino, Robby Phoenix, and Joey Kaos for all the knowledge bestowed upon me to continue to expand my career and my personal development.

This school supports all races, ethnicities, backgrounds, sexual orientations and identities.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I booked the ring offered for 1 day. On the day, I came with my friends to train boxing and the owner said they don't want us around and told me they won't refund the $300 deposit they asked for. Racists!< /Text>

<review>I’ve been living at Vista Heights for 4 years now and it just gets better and better! Our new manager, Vanessa, is doing such a great job running this property. She’s super sweet and professional. I’m glad to have such great people taking care of my home. Our maintenance man, Erik, does a wonderful job as well. They are knowledgeable and extremely helpful. I feel lucky to be here. I’d 10/10 recommend these apartments to anyone looking for a nice place to live. Everything is kept so clean and nice, weekly yard maintenance, they go above and beyond to make sure tenants are doing well and living comfortably. Thanks San Mar for hiring such amazing staff!!</review><gmapID>0x80945d511cfa634d:0xec4349403688c369<//gmapID>< user>

<text>I’m writing this review for my mother Linda Carter.

I have been a resident at Vista Heights for 22 years.

Over the years I have witnessed several managers. Some really strict and others, not so much. In the short time that Vanessa has been our manager, she has gotten a lot accomplished.

If I have a problem, she is quick to fix it! I am VERY excited to see what else she has planned for us here at vista heights!

I would also like to give a big shout out to our maintenance guy Eric. He is absolutely amazing! We are very lucky to have him!<//text>< pictures>

Quick response time and  great communication. The process from start to finish was a breeze. Erik, building maintenance, is appreciated as well. They work well together to take care of tenant needs and that was very apparent from the start. Apartment is clean and moderately updated.<//Review>< Pictures>

Hi, I'm a resident here at your Oakhurst properties and your new management, Vanessa Cooper is making a great difference already. She is kind and is constantly making sure everything looks good on the property and the tenants are good. She's very respectful and it's good to see her doing her job. Absolutely love this new change.<//text>

I was extremely interested in one of their properties and tried to reach out multiple ways and I finally was able to get an application. Than after having some questions I have not heard back or been able to get in contact again. I will be looking elsewhere because staff is not there to help, imagine living there? Forget it.< /Text>

<Review>I wanted to let you guys know that I was very impressed with Eddie (Eddy? Not sure how he spells it) this morning. He did an excellent, thorough, proper job on both the drier flapper exhaust and removing the dead trees. His attention to detail was great and on top of that, he's got to be one of the nicest and friendliest guys on the planet. I think it's important to recognize when people do a fantastic job, which he did today, and San Mar is lucky to have someone like him. Thank you for sending him out this morning!< /Review>< pics>

<review>I have had the worst experience ever living at Casa de Luna apartments under San Mar Properties. The management was never there or answered their phone. The water would shut off without notice and then when you called to ask the staff would laugh at you for complaining that you needed to use the restroom, needed water or that people needed to feed their kids. Also homeless people come in due to the management never fixing the drive-in gate and they steal out of homes and break into cars. Its despicable and I say DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! Now I have made my complaints because I was tired of the disrespect from management and now in RETALIATION from management I am being OVERCHARGED for my move out fees. My whole carpet was replaced when our carpet was very clean, cleaned twice during our stay and never worn shoes in the apartment. This is most ever have I been charged THIS MUCH for a move out fee and it is retaliation for knowing my rights. I had to even fight for a walk through of my apartment because san mar desired to CANCEL MY WALKTHROUGH. Worst apartment I lived at and honestly despicable while COVID-19 takes countless jobs that they would try to OVERCHARGE THEIR RESIDENTS. I am one of the many millions of Americans out there that lost their position and they charge us $1,500 for move-out fees and when we cleaned the carpet twice and never wore shoes in the apartment. They replace my whole carpet due to Retaliation from me complaining about the water shutoffs without notice or that they STOLE money by charging me fake late payments and pocketing $50. Also they lost my lease I signed and put me on a month-to-month when I have copies of signing a 9-month lease. I wish the management actually had a heart and cared about the people they serve instead of retaliating against the people they are supposed to serve.</review><user_name>Chris Olivas< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful Manager Tonya, she is kind and always asking if we need anything done around the complex. We see her walking around the complex picking up paper and trash keeping it clean herself. She always makes herself available even when she does not need to be. I want to thank you for bringing us a good manager form your company. Big thanks Tonya</Review>

<Text>I am the VP on our HOA and found San Mar as our property manager. I have lived at Woodward Lake in Americana Shores since 1999 where we have had 4 different management companies. San Mar is without question the best! Tamara and her staff manage with professionalism, common sense, fairness, intelligence, eagerness, and above all integrity. They have been a breath of fresh air and I hope future boards retain them for years to come. I would rate them 10 stars!</Text>< userid>

The corporate office themselves seem very unorganized. They are extremely neglectful to important matters. It took me 3 months to get an air conditioning unit while my daughter was only a month old and suffering from heat exhaustion. They informed me of things that needed to do and so i did them, a month later they gave me a notice for the same thing. And then informed me again at my door (waking up my daughter which could have been avoided because they had just seem me outside my front door). My porch was clean. They wouldn't let me have any patio furniture outside due to blocking the sidewalk,  however they don't mind the neighbors having theirs out and it takes up their whole space. It's not worth the rent.< /text>

I have worked for SANMAR for over a year now and I must say that I absolutely love my job. SANMAR cares profoundly not only about all of their residents being happy but also their employees. It truly is one big family and I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for either a great place to live or work to consider SANMAR Properties.< /Review>

if you enjoy fighting for the deposits you are owed. and enjoy being ignored and avoided. please move into their apartments. you will LOVE it.
since moving out they charged me over $1300 ($200 something after eating up my deposits). they replaced the carpets... even tho i told them to call the carpet cleaning company if there were ANY problems with the carpet before replacing it. it had a warranty. Also the "Invoices" they gave me were from 2012 and march 2014 (i moved in on 1/24/14) they charged me for exterior and interior paint. (BS the walls were just like i left them). they charged me for a cleaning fee even tho i spent over 6 hours cleaning. i am OCD about cleaning. they also charged me a bunch of other stupid non valid charges. it is now 1/27/15. and they are only going to "settle" for $400. which at this point (which is probably what their plan was all along) i just want to wash my hands of this BS and move on and take whatever i can get since i know they just want to scam everyone out of their deposits. ON TOP of over charging for a DUMP!
i moved out of Windscape Apartments (owned by san mar) on 12/13/2014. on that day i paid out of my pocket for $125 carpet cleaning including the black light check and deotorization. over the year i lived there. i also lived with unwanted roommates (mr. cockroaches and mr spiders and also mr ticks. NOT who i want to live with.) the spiders were larger than a quarter and the cockroaches were the width of a size 8 shoe. my dog got 8 ticks in the span of 3 weeks. everyday i would remove the ticks. next morning she would have another one. i paid $300 in vet bills when she got an infection from the ticks. i also had MULTIPLE maintenance issues. fence blowing over in the beginning of the year (took more than 3 days to get put back up, it was also a half a** job). garbage disposal was broken (even had maggots crawling out of it at one point). bathroom sink drain was broken. dish washer ALWAYS left sand on my dishes even after cleaning it with that dishwasher cleaner thing idk how many times.
all in all if  you want a migraine move here.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Bad agency like most. I have been renting the house for 6 years and they do not fix anything. Something breaks down and they take weeks to fix you have to be calling them daily and they just get silly. I have 3 weeks without my window air being used since it is the only one for the whole house and more than a week calling them daily to come fix it and they do not come. Temperatures have been up to 115 degrees.

(Original)
Pesima agencia como la mayoria. Tengo 6 años rentando la casa y no les arreglan nada. Se te descompone algo y tardan semanas en arreglarlo tienes que estarles llamando diariamente y solo se hacen tontos. Tengo 3 semanas sin que mi aire de la ventana sirva ya que es el unico para toda la casa y mas de una semana llamándoles diariamente que vengan a arreglarlo y no vienen.  Las temperaturas an estado hasta a 115 grados.</Text>

<review>Staff it always amazing. But wow today kept getting worst and worst. You would think they would be MORE careful and CLEAN bc of COVID-19 but not only did we get 2 DIRTY glasses.. it only came with 1/2 the shot after we returned them. Lol we come here every week.. sadly not coming back for a while.. Going to El Tarasco for now on :)< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhcwVNkYSi4_hYtBe-soDZosoImSgoufFv-uU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record>

Delightful sitting area outside. The mist sprayers were very welcome!

The food was perfectly cooked and quite tasty.
If you're looking to dine in during this whole covid era, this is a great place for it.< /text>

<review>I have definitely had better food. Salsa has no taste.. it's like pace picante sauce from the jar...chips taste taste like the bag too. My Margarita  was good.. not worth the 100 dollars spent there on dinner for 2..w 2 drinks.... I wont go eat there again.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Food was wack.. I ordered they're canned asada platter with a quesadilla and best believe that steak was so dry almost like its been frozen for like a month it wasn't even tasty.The enchilada was good but I mean its a enchilada My buddy just ordered some beans with chorizo and some grilled onions and jalapeños and the 2 tacos he gave me tasted so much better than my whole meal this place was good at some point its not even average anymore, should of gone get me some burgers instead of wasting my money here.<//Review>< user>

We got there around 11:30 and it wasnt busy at all we where sat under the canopy and waited and waited and waited. Finally a man comes to tell us your server will be right with you. So we waited and waited around. When our server came he was good. The food was ok nothing special the molcajete was mostly beans. The sauce on the enchiladas looked like can sauce. The horchata was pretty good.</Text>

There was a band here for years on Wednesdays and then they vanished for some reason no one knows (the staff said "I dunno" when I asked about it) but now they are back on Tuesdays @7:30... They play on the patio now but they still sound awesome! So the food is delish... the ambiance is relaxing... the drinks are yummy and then you dance to make the night complete. Check it out!</review>< Pictures>

Good music... lots of people fun place to go!  Everytime I'm here it's shoulder to shoulder and hot inside.  Takes a minutes to get a drink tho.  Friendly staff and seems like a secure place.  Clean bathrooms was a plus for anyone who's had a few drinks!< /Text>

I just have to say is WOW!!! We celebrated my parents Anniversary and from beginning to end the best service JC and Felipe were the best. The food is amazing, drinks are great and overall the room was well decorated and spacious for our guest. We had such a great time and the manager was very generous and kept checking up to make sure things are running smoothly.  I will recommend this place to anyone . The experience was great and will be returning.<//text>

We only came here because Xeviches was too packed and we were starving. Four adults and a baby. The music was really loud but that's fine. They seated us quickly but didn't bother to mention that I wasn't allowed to wear a tank top until we were seated. I guess you can enforce whatever arbitrary rules you want if you own the restaurant, but we also have the right to leave and drop a 1 star review. It was too loud for us to even hear each other anyway, so it worked out perfect.
Next time I come, we will all wear 90s neon windbreakers and gold chain necklaces and pants covered in dirt, which does not violate your dress code. ;)</Text>

Mariachi was great.  Service was great but the food was not so great.  It definitely did not have the homemade taste.  Very painful and commercial in flavor.</Text>

<Text>I gave this place 3 stars, only because of the fact that you could not hear yourself think over the loud music! Don't get me wrong! I enjoy music! But I enjoy speaking, and having a conversation while eating there! I just did not enjoy having to scream at my lunch companions. I DID enjoy the food! The service was great, the waiters were courteous, the place was clean!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user>

< review>
Ambiance :

Music was painfully loud and Im used to loud . They had a mariachi which I love but their speakers were blasting  to try to cover the music from their small bar in the next room. The bar was louder than any night club and it was just a very uncomfortable experience.  I walked out with a headache.

Food:

Mediocre .  They serves in big plates that are mainly 95% rice and beans.  The food is nothing  special and overpriced.  We had Shirmp al mojo de ajo and  it was undercooked and they used garlic seasoning instead of real garlic (8 small shrimps. I counted them). We ordered salad instead of rice and beans and don't have a single homemade dressing. The spicy  salsa was basically canned chipotle  chillies with some seasoning.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was okay... bacon was a little burned . The taquitos were okay and enchilada was just okay. Margaritas tasted like a lemonade kool-aid.

This place has so much potential the place it's really nice and  they have good menu but they lack  good chef and good management.</review>

<review>Food was amazing!  Great service!  Make sure you have sleeves if you are a man - even early in the day!  No worries, though...they graciously provided my husband with a new white T-shirt.   Absolutely worth the drive!<//review><rating>5< /rating>< Name>

Sunday brunch was excellent. Fresh home made totillas made the meal especially nostalgic for me. Nice atmosphere the only issue was the parking lot is small. So crowded days it maybe difficult to park. Overall I definitely enjoyed the meal and atmosphere.</Review>

I have mixed feelings about this place.  The food menu is limited in the sense that it’s all the same just with different meats. Which is also limited.

The best things about this place are:

1. Breakfast buffet: a great selection of food, including a taquero.
2. Molcajete sampler
3. Freshly made flour tortillas<//Text>

Nice restaurant. The food was okay. The waiter was never around. After he brought our food he literally disappeared. Another staff member came instead twice, but our waiter came just to take the order and that was it. Please bring staff wailing to interact with customers.< /text>

Poorly Service, I noticed none of the Servers wanted to help me. Poorly management, he was stearing and couldn't even help; could at least offer water. He look upset. Hostess had to take my food and drink order. Should have tip her.</Review>

The favorite item for me at this restaurant are the out of this world homemade flour tortillas.  Order some if you get the chance.   This place is large and well appointed.  The bar is separated from the dining area and features live music on some nights.  Since it was late when we arrived we shared some appetizers.  The queso fundido was delicious with generous portions of chorizo, and the delicious flour tortillas.  Service was a little slow and inattentive for a pretty slow week night.<//Review>

My wife and my parents visited Casa Torres couple week ago for the  Friday Night Mariachi show which was very entertaining, we all ordered from the dinner menu, I ordered a $20 dinner seafood platter, never the less the waiter served me a completely different looking plate than what was presented on the menu, to start the seafood had a very unpleasant smell like if it was NOT FRESH, it smell like rotten along with grill vegetables these also smelled not fresh, worst of all the sea crab legs were nothing like the menu image, menu image displayed large sea crab legs that look very fresh, the crab legs I was served tasted and smelled like Clorox, and were very tiny and skinny very salted and dried. personally I have never been more discussed eating seafood, I do not recommend this plate to anyone, worst of all management never asked us if the food and service was satisfactory, I do not Recommend this venue. very unhappy customer.</text>

Since the interior of the building is domed, it must have been made with steel re-enforced concrete.

Concave ceilings aren't good for amplified music and loud crowds. So acoustics is bad and cell data service is weak.

When I eat there and there is live music, I eat in the patio. I get the same great service.</Text>< user_id>

For dinner in the middle of the work week, this place is great. Large but inviting they even had dancing. In two separate rooms. And didn't have to drive far or fight traffic. Parking is a little sparce. Had to park across the street but no big deal I've parked ferther away when we go to the mall. { :-€)</Review>< Pics>

The service is pretty good.  They bring the alcoholic drinks fast but not the non alcoholic drinks.  I usually have to ask twice.  The food usually comes out pretty fast and it comes out hot.  The food is just ok.  I have had the chicken enchiladas, flutas, and tacos.  Nothing stands out in flavor.  From the people I was dining with that had dinner items, that did seem to enjoy there dishes.  One had a shrimp and fish dish that multiple people though was good.< /text>

< Review>
I went with party of 15 . the waitress was okay but after most of the food arrived 3 people were left without food. For some reason the cook supposedly drop the ball and 1 child and 2 adults were left waiting . by the time they were seved some of our guest were already getting to go boxes. They are overpriced too . $20 for a plate of food is ridiculous. I wont be going back .</Review>

Also a special taco de ojo are all the waiters with their buff arms carrying all those plates.   I wonder is they go scout them at the gym- we spotted one drinking his protein shake.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1552978327936, 'text': 'Hello we are happy to hear you enjoyed our hospitality we hope to see you again soon!

<Review>Great bar, reasonable price. S3.50 drink specials 4-7pm M-F. DJ or live music almost every night. About 20 TV's and they'll put anything on you ask. Try the margarita de tamarindo. Food is great but a little pricey for me. Love the tostadas de camaron. Security guards inside and out, never roudy. Sometimes hard to find a place to park.<//Review>< Pictures>

Apprenlty for this restaurant you need to go casually  nicely dressed.  They didn't let us in since my husband was wearing a tank top.  The security guard had offered him a shirt he could put over his tank top...<//text>

This place is over rated the food is  way over priced . I ordered the molcajete not what I expected simply trash and we was a family of 7 and we split the bill and they charged us dubble gratuity which came out to be about $22 on top of the bill never again I will never go back I recommend salsa and beer<//text>

Excellent customer service, they even gave us margaritas while we waited for our table
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, that's because chicken plates needs some improvements

Our first visit EVER... Made reservations for a party of 30 a month in advance and everything was great. We were seated immediately upon arriving, chips and salsa to snack on, followed by prompt drinks. We requested orders placed first for the kids and that worked out great.. food didn't take long. In fact food was out for everyone quicker than I expected, despite ordering 10mins after the kids. Service was excellent, food was excellent... and since we were celebrating a baptism, we brought our own cake that they also cut and served for us without an additional cutting fee. Rafael, gracias por todo, fue un placer. Will definitely be back for a date night.< /text>

Food was overpriced and beyond bland..i ordered a shrimp cocktail wich tasted like water. The service wasnt too bad, the queso fundido was pretty good i think it was the overall salvageable item in the menu...we were a party of 15 and overall werent happy with 12 out of 15 entrees, varying from shrimp,molcajetes enchiladas...
The mariachi played sets of about 6or 7 songs and took half hour brakes in between the 3 sets they played, repeating at least 2 songs in the sets and also sang "feliz navidad" in each one of the 3 sets...so, in reality they only played about 4 to 5 songs ... i would definitely not come back</review>

Music great, but good soso, and also their margaritas stuck. They have no taste or flavor and prices for food is extremely high for what they give you on a plate?< /review>

Over priced and the food isn’t great. Portions are way small. Order was screwed up.  Informed the owner about our first time experience and was promised they’ll make it right but never heard back.

Ordered albondigas soup and there were only 3 small meatballs onions n carrots... mostly soup. 1 carne asada burrito w meat n cheese only but got beans n rice. A taco plate w rice n beans. The bill came to over 50.00!!!

I would not only never return but advice everyone to avoid this place.<//Text>

<text>Over priced and the food isn’t great. Portions are way small. Order was screwed up.  Informed the owner about our first time experience and was promised they’ll make it right but never heard back.

Ordered albondigas soup and there were only 3 small meatballs onions n carrots... mostly soup. 1 carne asada burrito w meat n cheese only but got beans n rice. A taco plate w rice n beans. The bill came to over 50.00!!!

I would not only never return but advice everyone to avoid this place.< /text>< UserId.>

<text>I went there for the first time last week and expected more. The waiter was super nice but it was very unorganized when we first went in I guess because of the graduations that were going on in the large parties that were going on. The food portions were not exactly what I expected they could have been a little bit more prepared<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Food poison!!!
I went here last night. I ate chile rellenos and buffalo wings ,
Today i woke like someone is chooking me around quearter to 3 in the morning,i keep coughing.  And the spicy goes in my throat, and nose. I feel like i was food poison. My husband texted me if i was awake. And i said yes.
And he feel the same too.
We texted each other of how we feel. Same symptoms, the spicyness goes in the throat and want to throw up. Looks like they didnt prepare the food well.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

PLEASE do your self a favor and save your money on the mix drinks. First order a Mojito. It Taste more like a margarita on the rocks
Second dring had a "Harrito" again more like water and tequila with ice.</Review>

<review>This place was recommended from my friend. Sincerely it was the first time going to this place and it was a bad experience. It took and hour just to get my food and when receiving the molcajete it was missing some things that it said on the menu. Once receiving the check I was overcharged until i told the waiter tho take the items thats we didn't order. I would reconsider twice before going to casa torres. It was an unpleasant experience.</review><rating>1< /rating><gmapID>0x80c2902caa0abfc9:0x95e5628910c65ae9< /gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

The ambient is what I liked the food was ok but not great and a little pricey but I guess that's how the band and mariachi get paid.</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Service: good
Atmosphere: good
Food: good I expect the rib eye stake cut, I asked for it between medium and 3/4 but they gave it well done and not only that, but it seemed that they fried it or put it on the grill and pressed it to cook it quickly, we even commented that If they did deep fried it was rather fried and not roasted ... From then on everything was fine

(Original)
Servicio: bueno
Ambiente: bueno
Comida: buena expeto el corte rib eye stake, lo pedí entre medio y 3/4 pero me lo dieron well done y no solo eso si no que parecía que lo frieron o lo pusieron a la plancha y lo presionaron para cocinarlo rápido incluso comentamos que si lo hicieron deep fried pues estaba más bien frito y no asado... De ahí en más todo estubo bien</Review>

(Translated by Google) Good place, live music although you can hardly hear even the waiters of what is heard. The bar part was excellent!

(Translated by Google) I love this place is beautiful, but there is something I did not like. The waiter arrives asking us for the order (very attentive) but he did not ask my cousin for the order and El Niño is very sad and said “I don't feel special” that gave me a lot of sadness.
But good mistakes we all make.
The food is delicious, the drinks are also delicious. 100% recommended.

Me encanta este lugar es bellísimo, pero hay algo que no me gusto. El mesero llega nos pide la orden (muy atento) pero no le pidió la orden a mi primito y El Niño está muy triste y dijo “no me siento especial” eso me dio mucha tristeza.
Pero bueno errores todos cometemos.
La comida es riquísima, las bebidas también son muy ricas. Recomendado al 100%.<//text>

(Translated by Google) They Can Improve .... please advise the cooks that TAP WATER can be tasted on food including gelatin.
Dry rice, cold beans, whipped enchiladas, burnt flan, the menudo is disgusting. and simple bar drinks. The birria was ok.
