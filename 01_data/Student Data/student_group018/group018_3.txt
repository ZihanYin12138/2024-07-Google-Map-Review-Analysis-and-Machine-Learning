Thank you dr. bogey, Dr. Hsu, PA katy , nurses Gloria and sandy, and anybody else I forgot thank you.

<Text>I have been here several times for severe poison oak reactions needing urgent relief and I have been helped quickly and efficiently each time.

<text>Went for the free outside Covid testing clinic last year. They keep sending me bills every month and final notices when I’ve called billing about 20 times to resolve the issue. Also tried to charge me for a hospital room when I never left my car and tried to miscode things to charge my insurance for. Horrible hospital stay away.<//text>< Response>

<text>The best hospital I’ve been too. First off, shout out to the Surgery Center team! They are amazing, polite, funny, and make you feel very comfortable. I’ve had two surgery’s this year and each time was a great experience. I would definitely recommend getting work done here. I really wish I could bring them all food or flowers but with Covid spiking up, I would rather not put anyone at any risk. I hope this review reaches a higher up and can recognize what an amazing team they have there.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Dr. Bogey & my lovely RN Marcelle were among several truly wonderful medical PROFESSIONALS I was so well cared for during my visit.

I have a seriously long medical history
I have serious issues I'm facing.
I could not have hoped for better in a care team❣ From my lab tech who was one of the BEST "sticks" ever ~ painless 🤗!! To the x-ray tech I chatted Darier disease with, all were a pleasure despite off the charts pain & I was a little foggy & confused when I arrived.

They stabilized me, did what I needed to feel better and got me back headed home.

BRILLIANT

<review>I had my gallbladder removed at the surgery center on the 14 of May.
The staff was absolutely amazing from the minute I walked in until the moment I rolled out.
They kept me comfortable and relaxed.
Every single person from the front desk to nurses to the Dr. had a smile on there face and were warm and caring.
They kept a cheerful balance and kept me laughing the few hours I spent there.
Thank you thank you thank you to every single one of you. You care and should all know how much you all make a difference in people’s lives.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I spent my Christmas Eve 12/24/2019, Christmas Day 12/25/2019 and discharged on 12/26/2019 at Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital. My husband and I was just visiting family for the holidays and to our surprise, I was admitted to the ER in the morning of Christmas Eve due to severe pain  that was unmanageable, then sent to emergency surgery shortly after assessment due to my medical illness advancing.

The staff was so pleasant and understanding from admission in the ER, Admission Nurse, ER doctor to OB-GYN Surgeon till the day I was discharged.

THANK YOU TO ALL the Staff that helped me!

I'm so glad I was able to write down  some of the names that helped me during my stay. If I do not mention your name, it's because I wasn't all there in my head, but you are great and you loved by the McDonald Family!

Well, we as people know the difference when we are treated right or not treated well. Do you think this Hospital should have been sued in a Court of  Law, (?), when you come in with a Nose bleed that was result of a botched operation by another Doctor from San Jose and you just seen him and while you where traveling to get back to where you reside which is here in Hollister, the packs in your nose slip out do to an onset of bleeding( Hot Day.), Now, have a decision, as had to pull over on 25 in front of Trical and exit Vehicle to clear airway passage and change my sweat shirt as it is soaking with blood, do I go to Hazel Hawkins or Saint Louise(?), question will I make it. Lots of Blood having a hell of a time trying to stop the flow, nothing is working. Decision go to Hazel, closer.
I make it to Hazel, Blood everywhere, as soon as I am taken to a room, passed out. Loss of Blood. Definitely would not have made it to Saint Louise. Would have crashed Vehicle. The ER Doctor, says I have to be transported to San Jose Regional and that in His opinion I did this to myself to get pain Medication. WHAT. This Is California. You can get anything you need if that is what you perfer.
So I tell the ER Doctor I need to go back to where I reside and get my medication for Harvonni as I am on Hep. "C", treatment. He states I will remove the nose packs he placed in and you can leave. Then say's I will call the Cops, Go ahead. He does. The Cops show up. The cops say can not leave. Explain my situation. They say we will put you on a three day pysch hold. Three Cops show up for this enlighten Drama. And not one say's I will go over and get your medication as I even suggested that also.
So after about 3 hours closer to 4, the ambulance shows up and taken to San Jose Regional. No Harvonni. The Other Doctor, Nose Doc, not there. WOW. So it had come to my attention that should have been given a blood transfusion. Did not get my Harvonni until 39 plus hours later.
My Hep "C" treatment failed. Now some of you may find it in that brain of yours to be upset about this post. Let me assure you. If you do. Your a Whack JOB. I am the one who went thru this ordeal and reaped the consequences of it, NOT YOU. So do you think this Hazel Hawkins Hospital should have been SUED IN A COURT OF LAW ?< /Text>

<Text>This is definitely a small town hospital. They do not have the organization to have all the doctors under their one roof.  They have a Clinic a few block's away set aside for the doctors which are new, young and don't seem to be capable of making a dagnosis. Inefficient waste of time, money for both the hospital and the patient.
When I went to the clinic for help, I couldn't receive it due to lack of expertise and equipment.
I ended up at the hospital's emergency  room as I couldn't wait a week or two to get a second xray and go back to the clinic. The hospital was where I would have had to go for the xray's that the doctor couldn't perform at the clinic. First time I have ever been to a clinic so small they couldn't give you the basic test's to diagnose an immediate illness. I would have to give this organization a D for planning and accessibility.
The doctor in the emergency room seemed new, young and while he said he had a doctor to refer with there wasn't a lot of action in the emergency room. It still took me close to 3 hours to get through the system they have in place. That being said, I believe they came out with the correct diagnosis.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>I've lived in 5 different states and this is the worst hospital I've ever been to. Blood on the floor of the room I was put in. Half the doctors think they're better than everyone. They don't have updated equipment. They have VERY low security. The nurses take over 20 minutes to get to you when you call them with the call button.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80921d9700b07031:0xe6cab1aec0a0c393< /Gmap_id>< name>

Shady billing department, Completely lacking. Paid my bill stated I was done, I called 9 months later when was moving to verify I had no bills just to make sure. Same response I was good. Now it's been 9 months from that point so yes almost two years and I'm getting a bill. Cannot express how beyond PISSED I am. Middle of November no less. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and stay on top of them never once was anything mention of anything pending or waiting for approval all that was said was that I had NOTHING. So keep that in mind next time you choose to come to this hospital.< /Text>

It was 3PM and the waiting room had only three people in it.   It took 1 hour to see the doctor who asked for x-rays and now here it is 2 hours later and we still have not gotten the x-rays nor seen the doctor again for a prognosis.

Watching the staff it looks like they are all moving at 1/4 speed... then they leave here and all complain that the grocery store is slow or that their pizza was delivered in 27 minutes.

If they are this incompetent during the the slow time... I would not like to see this place after a bus accident.

I am not pleased with this ER.

Upon checking in, the nurse was asking me health related questions; while very polite, I noticed he was checking boxes without asking me the question first. Such as: have you traveled outside of the country recently. He checked 'no' on that box without even asking me. That is pertinent information that he didn't bother to get, instead he made an assumption.

The other problem is that I was told that I was dehydrated, and that I really needed water to hydrate myself. If this was such a concern to them, why wouldn't they start an IV and give me saline? Or at the very least, not make me wait half an hour to bring me a tiny water bottle?

Another thing I will mention since I'm writing, is that I refused pain meds. Which is completely my right and will not have a negative effect on my health. The nurses would not accept this answer and kept bothering me about it; and not in a polite way. They were very rude about it with a tone of voice that would make you think I was in anaphylaxis refusing epinephrine.

These problems were not the only shortcomings I noticed and paid the price for. I am not at all impressed by this hospital or its staff. I see a need for ethics and customer service training...</Review>

A heartfelt thank you to Hazel Hazels is too inadequate so I write this.
I was admitted to ER  to see if I was having an MS exacerbation that was the first in 10 years.
Dr Bogie’s  quick kind and thorough diagnostics and immediate staff coordination resulted in a 4 day stay of intensive treatments that arrested a full blown exacerbation and permanent loss of ability to walk and talk.
Dr Herrick, was a medical quarter back who took gentle charge of coordinating care with the most informed, kind, and efficient doctors, nurses, nursing assistants etc that you could imagine. My Nuerologist, Dr Jain, worked hand in hand with Dr Herrick all along the way. Even the dietary management and kitchen team werecso pleased to continue special cooking and food needs .

Claudia Cameroon, inpatient physical therapist, was so informed and her ray of sunshine easily turned negative thoughts to more positive healing ones.
Personable and informed Josh Mercier, Medical Social Worker, offered post relief transportation and many other resources that would be invaluable for future follow- up care and getting medications, and offered to help handle any issues in the future.
I’m so handled....

Thank you for all you kind, informed, timely and humanistic approach to a life-changing moment that could have turned out so differently and affected my life forever. 😘😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😬</review>

< Review>
When I broke my leg riding in Hollister Hills, and on my way to the hospital, my friend called the E.R. to make sure they had a wheelchair ready to go. They said they “don’t have any available wheelchairs”... a hospital... with not enough wheelchairs... the waiting room had two other people, I might add.. so “no available wheelchairs” is a very pathetic excuse on their part. How did they expect a girl with a broken leg to walk into the hospital??
This is the ONLY reason they did not receive 5 stars from me.

Once I got called back, which didn’t take very long. EVERY nurse and doctor I talked to in the E.R. was so helpful and always kept a smile on my face despite the pain. I need to take a moment to call out one specific doctor that was by far the BEST doctor I’ve ever met. His name is Michael Bogey. He always managed to keep me laughing, distract me from any pain, and did anything and everything to make sure I was okay. He made sure I knew what signs I would need to look for after I left the hospital. If I could give him 6 stars, I would. He was amazing! If I ever break a bone again, I will gladly drive back to this hospital just to be checked on by him.< /Review>

<text>Yet another horrible encounter. Go in for food poisoning and it’s like they’re trying to say it’s everything but that. The nurse brittney has a horrible attitude. She makes faces n rolls her eyes because she thinks I can’t see her. Don’t take the people you love here, no one will care.</text>< userid>

My experience with Hazel Hawkins Hospital and its staff have always been very positive (I was born in the old hospital 71 years ago) and have always defended it when I heard negative remarks from friends or family. However, this review is in response to a recent visit with one of your doctors, Dr. Al-Hasan.  I have never been so rudely treated and yelled at by a doctor in my life when I was just trying to have a discussion with him about my wife's condition and the horrible pain she is currently going through.  He basically accused of her of being a drug addict and trying to get pain medications and me of trying to question his authority as a doctor when she was just trying to relieve her chronic pain and severe depression after her previous doctor took her off the fentanyl she had been on for 17 years and was the only pain/fibromyalgia medication that had ever worked and would allow her to function despite her never ending pain.  Dr. Al-Hasan should not be allowed to meet with patients.  Such behavior should not be tolerated or acceptable by a doctor representing Hazel Hawkins Hospital.  Thank you for reading my angry, but justified, tirade.
Be Well!

I went to Hazel Hawkins for an ultrasound because my baby was in a weird position and my midwife wanted to get the exact position figured out.  She recommended seeing someone in San Jose but I didn't want to drive that far just for an ultrasound, so I went to Hazel Hawkins because I live within 2 miles of the hospital.  My mistake!  The people at the front desk were friendly but the ultrasound tech was clearly ready to get out of there as soon as possible.  I couldn't see the screen and mentioned it several times but she didn't move it so I could see better. I had to hold my head up and twist to see it the entire time (40 minutes). She pointed out a couple body parts but did it so quickly that I couldn't tell what she was pointing at. When I'd say "I didn't see what you pointed at" she'd act grumpy and point it out again. Or if my husband or I asked "What is that?" she'd answer us like we were stupid. "Ummmmm, it's the PLACENTA?" Had we known we wouldn't have asked, obviously! She only let us see the face for a few seconds. When she was finished I asked if I could see the face one more time and she got it up but again, only for a second or two. If I had blinked I would have missed it. I asked what position it was in and all she would say was "It's head-down." so I said "But is it posterior?" and she didn't know what I meant. She said "What do you mean posterior? It's head-down." So I said "Which way is it facing?" THEN she explained where it was. Every thing we said to her seemed to bother her and she was not at all interested in answering our questions or making it enjoyable.  When I had ultrasounds done for my other babies, the techs were excited and clearly loved their jobs--who wouldn't be excited to be able to see the miracle of life every day and watch expectant parents get to see their baby in the womb for the first time?  Seems like a joyous, fulfilling job to me.  The ultrasound tech at Hazel Hawkins was about as thrilled about her job as the average DMV worker.  The entire process took about 40 minutes but I was ready to leave after about 5 minutes because of her negative attitude.</text>

Lots of sitting and whating.  Then they don't bill your insurname correctly.  Had $1000.00 taken from my tax return out. Of nowhere and now I discover there's a nether a count in collections for over 900.00 after I provided my insurance 3 times and when I call the hospital I get a bissy tone.<//Text>

<Text>I just went to this clinic SAT there for two hours with my 3 year old was under the impression I had an appointment come to find out some rude lady named Diana who supposed to be in charge came out with attitude and told me I wasn't going to be seen today was not at all nice about it didn't even apologize made it seem like it was my fault and told me. I should have known better I was a walk in none of this was explained to me when I made the appointment over the phone so basically I wasted 2 hours of my time sitting there for no reason I have a wedding next week and I'm so sick she was rude had a chip off your shoulder put your hands up in the air would even let me finish talking all she did was run her mouth and not allow me to explain what I just said right now Ugh, .. so upset<//Text>< Pics>

This is definitely not the pharmacy that you're going to want to go to, I know of people who have heard of people who died waiting in the emergency room, but couldn't get any medication from the pharmacy... Unfortunately, this Hospital is going downhill.<//Text>

Breakfast burritos...!!!!!! Your search is over ladies and gentlemen.. especially for vegetarians , Village Eatery will make you the best veggie sausage breakfast burrito in town. Great taste and even better customer service. Thank you for making my boys morning that much better once a week.

Love. Love. LOVE. LOVE. The food is amazing. The prices are great. The portions are wonderful. The staff is so friendly and great service every time. The owner knows our family by name because it has become tradition to go there. I just could continue to rave. But go get some food there already!<//Text>

Loved coming here to eat, one of my favorites, but recently saw they have a sandwich called The Trump and needless to say very disappointed. I can't in good conscience eat here anymore.

Edit: this is a reply to the employer response. A lot of websites still have that sandwich on the menu apparently. But I see it no longer is. I should hope so. I'll definitely be back then. Thank you for clarification!</review>

<text>My husband and I had  been here a couple of times. Food was good. Service had been very good before. The young waitress working there in the morning is nice and attentive. Not so the man that seems to be the owner and his son. Last time they  treated us as if  they did not want us to return even though we always leave a good tip.
They mixed up our orders, did not come once to check on us   and it was very obvious that they purposely took forever to give us the check and then to pick up our card. We do not recommend this place and  will take our money somewhere else. There are plenty of good places in the area.</text></record></dataset><record>

Village Eatery in Glendora services Great Food, Large portions and the quality is 2nd to none. If you want a meal that compares to a home cooked meal but don't want to cook it yourself then the Village Eatery is for You! Great Staff as well!</review>

< Review>
I wanted to have the crepes w strawberries filled with cheesecream. I asked the waitress if that was good, she said it is great. When it came, you can barely see the crepes. The plate is mostly the creamcheese, the artificially flavored strawberry and canned whipped cream (see photos). I make crepes myself but much better and healthier. I had a meal that mostly consistent of ingredients straight from the container,  ew. Friendly staff though and the food came 10 min after I ordered it.< /Review>

I took anatomy and physiology here with Mr. Garcia and the class is very enjoyable to learn and very interesting! I have taken this class a few years ago in a Cal State and El Monte Rosemead Adult School put there students first and will always help if you have any questions. I never had that opportunity before since other schools required appointments to see a professor for any questions and time slots would be filled. In this school, I appreciate how teachers will always get back to you quickly and answers questions quickly (before and after class). I would recommend this school to anyone! I love the support the staff (counselors) and teachers have to offer here to help reach students career goals!</Review>

<text>As a current student in the medical assistant classes, I enjoyed every class. Professor García is extremely understanding and has helped students so much. He is very patient, knowledgeable, and a great human being. He places all his faith in you and believes in you. Even if you feel like you cannot do it he will push you to be your best self. No excuses. I am thankful for everything everyone at this school has done and continue to do for me. This is the best decision I could have made. As a single mother of two I recommend this school. Even if you believe you cannot do it, they will believe in you.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I had the pleasure of taking a Medical Assistant class with Mr. Garcia as well as an ECG course. He is a passionate and caring individual. Great at phlebotomy and everything to do with reading ECG strips. But above all he cares for his students and their success. El Monte adult school has a great team including but not limited to Ms. Mckay, Ms. Ruiz, and Ms. Bordador. Thank you all for your support.<//Text>

<text>I took an Anatomy and Physiology class with Mr. Jose D Garcia. It was a great class. Mr. Garcia is a great instructor. He made the class fun and interesting. Also, he is an instructor that really cares and understands his students. I am a mom with a full time job and he made the class manageable for people like me.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>I took the anatomy and physiology class with Mr. Garcia last quarter. Even though the class was in a virtual setting, Mr. Garcia managed to create a very fun environment for us to learn and emulated the feeling of a real classroom. I did not fully realize his efforts until I met some of my classmates this quarter. I felt very close to them despite having only known them through a screen. Not only that, but Mr. Garcia’s method of teaching has fostered close relationships between students and has made the subject much more enjoyable to learn.

I also took a computer literacy class with Mrs. Lazos-Quevedo last quarter. I used to be a timid novice computer user, but thanks to her detailed teaching methods, I have become an explorer with Windows 10 within a quarter. I have learned skills not only applicable to Windows10 but also totally different subjects in my academic career.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Shout out to EMRAS most exemplary teacher, Sandra Anderson. I went from speaking little English to a full time career in voice overs. She really knows how to put it down. It's clear to anyone who takes her class that teaching isn't just her vocation, it's her greatest joy. Add to that a heart of gold. She is one of those rare gifted gems.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I have and do recommend them to anyone and everyone interested in going to school. I stopped going to school because I got a job, which was the point for going to school.
10/4/18 --Well, I back again, Its been 5 years and i'm here to take a refresher course, so I can do a project at work I am planning on getting. I thought what better way to refresh my memory then coming back to school. I love it now like I did then. It's nice to be back.</text>< pics>

<Text>You won't regret coming to this school. Where can you find a school that offers similar subjects taught at other universities and community colleges for such a low tuition fee? The teachers here are helpful and are highly dedicated to their job. It's up to the students to make the most out of their education. This September will mark my first year here as a student. I've been taking up to 6 classes per quarter and I'm ready to learn more! :-)</Text>< pictures>

There is no reason to hesitate for the Anatomy & Physiology class.
Mr. Joce Garcia class is the BEST!!!

This class is exciting and fun.
He taught us easy ways to understand and explanations were so much helpful for every students.

Honestly, at  the beginning of the class, I got discouraged due to a second language speaker of English.
But he made me cheer up, and finally, I finished this class!!

Without the support of Mr. Garcia I would not succeed.

If you want to work medical fields near future and consider to taking pre-requisite.
Go and  find out Mr. Joce Garcia class.
No regret!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d0a3d385bfe3:0x8b3eb13d1d30f47f<//gmapID></record>

The school has been a blessing because it is shown me really and you Direction in my life and a different career. Currently I am here studying to become a medical assistant and I have a teacher mr. Garcia who is very thorough And Style of teaching is one that you can remember very quickly and comfortably. We just went over medical math and everyone was very hesitant to answer because obviously everyone was on different levels of their knowledge of mathematics but in the end everyone was able to own up to their own errors as well as by the end of day be on the same page. I would highly recommend this instructor and his class is dealing with EKGs as well as medical back office and laboratory procedures because if you are somebody who wants to kick start a new career or simply a new chapter in life you have to come to the school because it's affordable but also the instructor staff are very passionate to help adults Achieve great things.</Review>

<Date>1470523961483< /Date><Review>I've been a continuing student of EMRAS school for many years, and I keep coming back because they offer more advanced classes in the medical department that help get me closer to my goals. They offer morning, noon, and night classes. And actually care about education, and the instructors are all great teachers. Not over loaded with pre rec course work, what you would topically get from a fast pace community college and definitely  from one of those expensive private schools from my own past experience. Love that they have not lost funding or only cared about the profit and went private. It's possible because they care about the community and help make it easier for entry level students to continuing and make it affordable!! That's why I always recommend El Monte Adult. 💖🙂👍🏼< /Review>< rate>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>This is a great school with a variety of classes available to the public. If you are looking to get your G.E.D or finish your high school diploma, this is the place. It also offers ESL classes which are unfortunately impacted but there is a waitlist for those who are interested. You will be given a brief English test, assessed and then placed on the list. This place is also a CSET testing site. Parking is limited due to the large number of students in attendance. The formal parking lot has security and a supervised bike lock up area. If you are taking the metro, El Monte Busway is just a 10 minute walk down the street. Bus 76 and 268 pass directly in front of the school on their way to and from the depot. There are also some Foothill buses that run past as well. The area is relatively active at night with people frequenting businesses or attending the school.< /Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I would recommend other programs like Downey adult school. Their language services are nice, but their technical programs are not.
I do not recommend this school if you are interested in technical and vocational careers. Look for other schools

Best tire shop in Santa Cruz! Great prices in town for new and used tires, brake repair, and general mechanic services. They are quick, reliable, and the owner Frank got me the tires I needed in the same day with a great price! I recommend all my family and friends to go here.</Text>

Classic restoration cars being worked, little projects being done. Not a sterile corporate clean and perfectly clear , but an old school garage that treats you with old school respect and courtesy.

Frank is really sincere and honest about everything. His prices are difficult to beat especially for the attention to detail he has. It’s not a big fancy shop, but it’s run by people that know what they’re doing and put your car first! He fitted two tires for me, and one of them went flat so he took the tire and did a full check and inspected it for me to make sure I was driving on safe wheels. Thanks again!<//text>

They got us in immediately,  and we hit a snag...... we had the wrong size rotors! Any other place would have refused to do them. And just sell the tires. The owner here was so nice and had one of his mechanics give us a ride to O'Reillys to exchange them and got everything done in time so that we weren't late picking up our kids from daycare! We will be bringing all our trucks here from now on!< /review></record>

Really pleased with our experience here. Didn't have the used tires we were looking for but were able to get us new tires for a very fair price. Service was quick, considering the tires had to be brought from another location, & the staff was very friendly & helpful. Will definitely return for any other tire needs.<//review>

I cannot fathom the fact of how many ppl including myself do not do enough research to save money. I found this place by calling all the tire shops in town asking for a specific tire and got different quotes all around but the one to stick out was Independent Tires. Frank is the best. Got me what i wanted at a great value.. Whos cares if the rotation is not free.. Its not like were promised tomorrow anyways. Hope this helps, thanks for reading.< /review>

We stopped here for a emergency repair. Our rotors and brakes were at the end of there life and we needed to cheap used tires for the front. He gave us a really good price on everything.  We had to wait a little bit but nothing good happens fast when it comes to auto repair and safety. I'd sure like to see this guy's business grow!!!!! Thank you again< /Review>

Great business. My second time there. Honesty is so important when it comes to purchasing tires I bought used both times they're in much better condition than any used tires I've ever purchased before the owner listens to your concerns and he's honest with his opinions and they're all are hard workers great place to go< /review>

Very fair price. Inflated to spec. Torqued to spec. Expertly balanced. Even though I came with my own tires, he stocks solid rubber and I get the impression that you would get a great value compared to other shops for the same price. Waiting area is spartan, but they have free wifi and a tv.<//Review>

These guys are great. I needed tires for my old truck and they had used ones, installed, and old ones disposed of, for an amazing price. They are a great locally owned business, the owner himself on hand and working. These will be be go to tire guys from now on!< /review>

These guys are da bomb. I didn't need an appointment, they were fast and friendly. Frank even gave me a little deal on my tires since they didn't have a used set and I bought new. Would highly recommend going with these fellas! - Camille, Canada< /Review>

Both times I had very quick service.  The owner is always there putting in sweat equity.  Both times he listened to my situation, presented me with various options (new vs used, 2 tires vs 4 tires) pro's and con's of each, and was fine with whatever decision I made.  Not a hint of a hard sell or upselling, even if I chose the cheapest option!  Service was completed extremely quick ... Always faster than the estimate given.  Highly recommend!  Although I haven't used it, they offer roadside assistance as well.< /Review>< Pics>

Please look up her Yelp reviews  -- they are extensive and extremely accurate about the horrible treatment you'll receive. Dr. Bickman's office staff was repeatedly rude and I witnessed them openly mocking and/or complaining about people they'd just been on a phone call with immediately upon hanging up. Despite not being overly busy, the wait time was almost an hour for my appointment, with no reason or explanation. Dr. Bickman herself was dismissive of my concerns, cold and unwilling to really take the time to listen to me and my symptoms. She recommended a route which in hindsight seems to have been only motivated by her ability to charge me A LOT of money, not by my medical needs. She's billed an excessive amount for routine lab tests and services, many of the bills not being covered by my insurance or being deemed medically unnecessary. I was not given the option to consent to these services or told that they might be medically unnecessary. I've called to discuss my concerns with her office and always been told to leave a message, which never gets returned. This doctor seems only motivated by how to squeeze out money from you, and not your medical needs. I've reported her to the CA Medical Board and urge you to stay away!<//review>

<Review>Unscrupulous Doctor profiteering from the pandemic. She charges $180 for a covid test, conducted on a street corner in a tent with nursing students she pays $18 / hour to sit in the heat. Payments are taken my manually writing down your credit card details. Ditto manual note taking for email addresses. Student staff weren’t informed about which test they were administering abs said ‘it should work for overseas travel but it doesn’t work for Hawaii’. Save your $$$$. What a scammer Dr Bickman is.<//Review>< pics>

I felt so comfortable in her care, every visit was always so smooth and I felt safe. I can’t wait to have another baby with Dr. Bickman. She is the best in LA. 5 stars!!!

Always an absolutely amazing experience at Dr. Beckman ‘s. I was greeted quickly and was in a room within 15 minutes of my arrival. The staff are always incredibly friendly and sweet and remember you of course! I had some concern about pain that I was having in my pelvic area and bickman quickly decided to do ultrasound to rule anything out. She’s always incredibly thorough and super careful and everything she does and goes as far as she needs to to make you feel perfectly comfortable! Cannot think her and her team enough for every time I visit is a great one. I wish all doctors were like this</review>

<response>None< /response><rate>5< /rate><Text>I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Bickman. I found her when I was 25 weeks pregnant after going to UCLA up until that point. I decided to switch because I felt the care at UCLA was impersonal, and not what I was looking for during pregnancy. Dr. Bickman provided me with the peace of mind I needed to get through my first pregnancy with a healthy mindset. She is extremely thorough, thoughtful and assuring. I definitely recommend her practice.< /Text>< Name>

Dr Bickman has delivered both of my babies and will deliver any others we have! I love her candor and her warmth. She's like an old pal at this point. Love her!<//review>

Please do not see this doctor because (1) her attitude is horrible and (2) she bills incorrectly to try to get money from the insurance company and you.

I went in for my annual pap smear 6 months ago, and my insurance company just let me know that this doctor is now trying to bill them random services and thus they had to deny the claims. So now this in-network doctor is trying to bill me $675 for a pap smear and refused to tell me what those charges were for.< /Review>

Easy to make an appointment and took about 10-15 minutes once I arrived for COVID-19 test which is done as you sit in your car. Note for this service you can't submit for insurance reimbursement, but you get results same day. It's fantastic. Nurse was super nice that helped me.< /Review>

<name>Claudia Stewart< /name><date>1619821656639< /date><rate>1< /rate><Text>I would never recommend Dr. Bickman to any pregnant woman looking for an OBGYN that will make her feel valued and respected. I chose Dr. Bickman for my prenatal care influenced by all the rave reviews about her but my experience with her and her practice was nothing short of awful. I had to wait 1.5-2 hours to be seen by her EVERY SINGLE TIME despite having an appointment and arriving on time. Her practice allows for multiple appointment to be booked at the same time as the sign up sheet indicates, which probably explains the excruciating delays. The wait was made worse by having to sit all that time in a small and crowded room with no proper ventilation during the worst of the Covid-19 outbreak. The alternative to wait outside in the cold during all that time did not make me feel any safer. Once I was finally seen by her, the process felt rushed and I didn't experience the warm demeanor described by other women. When I finally decided to transfer to another OBGYN halfway through my pregnancy, it took them 2 MONTHS to release my medical records after numerous e-mails, phone calls (for which I often waited up to 40 minutes on hold), and a HIPPA complaint. They even ignored my new medical team's requests for my records so we had no choice but to re-do a lot of the lab work and ultrasounds that had already been done and billed to my insurance, resulting in more out-of-pocket costs for me due to their gross negligence. I will never understand why my experience was so vastly different than most women in these reviews but it certainly made for bitter memories during a time when you feel most vulnerable and in need for good healthcare. For all pregnant ladies considering her as your doctor, I wish you nothing but the best. I hope you have better luck than I did!</Text>< pictures>

I needed a quick COVID test and was able to get it in 1 hour with no waiting. Yes $200 is a bit of change, but if you work for a decent company you should be able to get that reimbursed through your employer or your health insurance cover it. I work in the medical supply industry and was very grateful to get tested so quickly as I needed to know before getting back to work to fulfill my own mission helping people. Thanks for all you do in your normal operations and with COVID testing!<//Review>

<review>I find that every time I schedule an appointment over the phone, I get a call within the next day or two from the front desk asking if I can reschedule because Dr. Bickman has scheduled a last minute surgery. I am always understanding and reschedule, but *every single time* I go in to Dr. Bickman's office, I have to wait for an hour. For anyone working a full-time job, you can imagine this doesn't work when you have to get back to your job and can't waste an hour on waiting for a scheduled appointment.

As much as I enjoy Dr. Bickman, I find that both the rescheduling and 1+ hour waits are standard, so I will no longer be seeing Dr. Bickman.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Had a really bad experience. Wait time is RIDICULOUS. I waited around 2 and a half hours (with an appointment), and felt like she was really trying to get me out of there as quickly as possible when she did see me. She prescribed me medication without even running tests on me or listening to my full story. I also felt she was a little rude and didn’t make me feel comfortable... I don’t recommend.<//Review>

If there were more stars I would give her all the ones in the sky.

Been her patient since the late 2000’s watched her grow her practice

Yes, she does run late sometimes when does a doctor doesn’t run late?  She always apologizes and thanks you for the wait.  If she has to reschedule she also thanks you for accommodating.  She is well worth the wait for an impatient person like me.  She is funny, kind, caring, and knowledgeable.  Her exams have no pain due to her quickness.

Her office staffs are kind, friendly, and professional very accommodating

I see a lot of false negative comments about her, it bothers me I am here to tell you the truth not paid by her.

She is an excellent doctor furthermore more a daughter, a wife, and a mother.  To me, she is my super Dr. B nothing this woman can’t do</text>

I have been a happy patient of Dr. Bickman's for a decade. She is a kind, warm, caring, empathetic doctor, with a wonderful bedside manner. As doctors go, you cannot do better. I have lost track of how many people I've referred to her over the years. So it pains me to write this, but I would not want anyone else to go through what I am currently going through. After a decade of conversations about her kids and my kids and yoga and everything else under the sun, I went to see Dr. Bickman for my annual exam October 20th. I checked the box for new insurance and gave the front desk my new card, which they copied and gave back to me. Dr. Bickman was running behind that day, so after an hour I let the front desk know I was leaving and would call to reschedule. When I called, I was again asked over the phone if my insurance had changed since my last visit, and I said that it had, and that the office had made a copy of my new card when I was there. The woman on the phone (whom I assume was Grace) said she could see that in my chart. I came in on October 28th for my rescheduled appointment and again checked the box for new insurance and again confirmed they had my new information, which they said they did. Had my exam, and was then hit with a bill for $5715 because it turns out Dr. Bickman does not accept my new insurance, she is out-of-network and all claims were denied as a result. My insurance company has no record of anyone from Dr. Bickman's office or billing department calling to check eligibility, which is standard practice. Grace told me easily and kindly on the phone that this was "definitely their mistake" nonetheless no one has helped me get this resolved. I have now spent months during a pandemic when we all have too much on our plates already, making phone calls and sending emails trying to get the office to make this right. Grace also acknowledged her understanding that I would not have come in if I'd known Dr. Bickman was out-of-network. Finally, when I couldn't get anywhere with the front desk or billing, I asked for Dr. Bickman's email, feeling certain she did not know what was happening. I have now written two heartfelt emails to a person I've considered a friend as well as a trusted doctor, but no reply. Not sure what my next steps are, but since no one at the office seems to be ready to do the right thing, perhaps a public testimonial will get me the help I need. I own a business, and I must say this is not the way you treat anyone, let alone a loyal patient of a decade! So utterly disappointed.</Text>

Upon receiving this very scary news, of course my friend had questions and concerns. The doctor had failed to answer or even ease my friend’s concerns. My best friend was left confused and extremely scared, as was I and the rest of her family. The severity to which the circumstance is requires much more care and attention and answers from the doctor than the average checkup. My friend was told that she would be receiving a phone call with further information from the doctor a week after one of her tests, and had not gotten on a call until two weeks later, ONE THAT SHE HAD TO MAKE. I am extremely frustrated and angry on my friend’s behalf. It seems that the doctor has forgotten that she is working with human beings that have feelings and emotions. There is no reason why my friend should have to advocate for herself and make calls to YOUR PRACTICE in order to receive information that you had explicitly said you were going to relay. This is people’s lives. I hope everyone at this facility is disgusted by their behavior and how they chose to handle this situation. Take a moment to check yourself and ask why you became a medical professional.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

This lady is an absolute scam. Where do I even begin?

- Wait time is ridiculous. We're talking waiting 2+ hours, even with an appointment
- All the medical procedures came back coded with unreasonably high rates
- She schedules medically unnecessary appointments and procedures just to make more money
- She insists on you coming in unnecessarily frequently, and then only sees you for 5 min
- She ordered tests for me (which she called genetic tests). They tried to make me pay $50+ just to access the test results, and when I finally got a hold of the results, it turns out none of the tests she ran were genetics.
- I saw this Dr 2x in March 2020. It is now Nov 2020 and I am still dealing with billing issues where she processed the payments from my insurance provider but is still claiming that I never paid the bills.
- There are ads all over her office. She clearly is just out to make money from any angle possible.
- She said she was in-network for my healthcare and turns out she was not so now I'm paying up the wazoo but like 10 min with this doctor months ago.

I can't believe I only saw her twice 9 months ago and I'm still dealing with all of this.</Text>

It's taken me three years to even be able to speak about my experience with Dr. Bickman without balling my eyes out. A friend finally insisted I write a review in hopes it would help avoid any trauma for whomever may be reading this.

I'll start by saying that I prepared for birth by practicing hypo birthing during my pregnancy. I was upfront about what I wanted with Dr. Bickman and presented my birthing plan. She seemed on board the entire time during my pregnancy. I told her I would have a doula present and that my wish was to have a natural birth, and not induce as long as everyone was healthy.

Well, everything went fine. My birthing time at the hospital was fine. The nurses at St. Johns were awesome. I labored for 30 hrs before being induced, which was not my plan but it was also my choice in the moment. I was so exhausted and I wasn't progressing.

But when it came time to push, I pushed for three hours.  It was a Friday, and I imagine Dr. Bickman had a room full of patients at her office. I was probably two hours into pushing and the head started to show, so the nurses phoned the doctor. I felt ready to really push and the nurses told me to wait until the doctor showed up, "15 minutes" they said. I begged they just get any doctor in, but was told to wait.

When she finally came in (not 15 min),  the whole energy in the room shifted. She came in rushed, constantly looking at her phone. Whatever progress I had made, wasn't there anymore. The head wasn't showing anymore. The nurses demeanor changed. At one point doctor Bickman yelled at the nurse, "I thought you said the head was almost out", and THREW her gloves at her, "These are the wrong ones". The energy went from peaceful to tense in less than 10 seconds. The nurses kept telling me to push and the doctor was just on her phone looking impatience. It took all I had to close my eyes, go to my happy place (thank goodness for hypnosis and my doula), and push my baby out.

The worst is what happened after. The epidural had worn off. I had a natural tear from birthing. Suddenly the doctor was shoving her hands all over without any explanation. There was no, " okay, you tore and we are going to stitch", or "I'm now going to shove something up you butt to help with the pain". I had my baby on my chest and her hands were shoving and pinching. I felt every stitch. I was in such pain that I broke that things that hold your legs up and the nurses had to hold my legs. My body went into shock after. At first I assumed that perhaps, it was an emergency and I was bleeding to death. But after speaking to my doula, she said she had never witnesses such rudeness, or violent handling.

She never had the best bedside manners, and perhaps that should have been a red flag for me. Needless to say, I switched my doctor and did not go back to her postpartum. I feel like she robbed me of that moment that we as becoming mothers, dream about: when you first meet your baby on your chest. If she had explained to me what was going on, so that I could expect it maybe I wouldn't feel so violated. But her attitude towards the nurses, her disregard of me, rudeness and lack of bedside manners left a traumatizing mark on my birthing experience that I still have trouble talking about.

Look, no matter what your birthing plan is, things will happen they way your baby chooses and change last minute. BUT you still have the right to have compassionate caregivers at your side, no matter what. If you are envisioning a more natural, peaceful birth for yourself, this is not your doctor.</text>

I have to say this was probably the most awful experience I have ever had at any doctor's office. I waited in the exam room for nearly an hour before the doctor came. My results were then given to me incredibly late and I had to call 10 times to even get them. They were beyond incompetent and I have never been more stressed or uncomfortable before. Although Dr Bickman was kind the way her office is run is simply not okay. Do not go here.<//text>

<Text>Dr. Bickman’s office was very clean and tidy, her staff were friendly and professional. I did my pre-travel COVID testing with Dr. Bickman and the procedure was seamless and simple.

Highly recommend her for COVID testing with pre-travel requirements.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Dr. Bickman is the best!! She is so efficient and doesn't waste any time. I know I can always count on Dr. B to give me the best medical options and attention. I also love how tech advanced the office is. Thank you!<//review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><rating>1</rating><review>I was supposed to go in for a follow up regarding a serious issue and have had to call three times to try to get something scheduled with the doctor. They have repeatedly told me different misleading information. Including that I need to call the manufacture of the IUD I’m supposed to receive.

I waited MORE THAN AN HOUR for a 15 minute appointment and the doctor was on her phone the entire time. She didn’t even tell me anything about the medical condition just ushered me out. I’m unsure if this was negligence or simply disrespect. I am going to be making one final call before I take further action with the hospital as I presume she’s attempted to charge my insurance.

Not only that, the front staff was openly sharing medical information that I could hear during my boring hour and a half wait in the dull waiting room. This is a clear HIPA violation.< /review><user>111632681373472412419< /user>< time>

<rating>1</rating><text>I waited 2 hours and 10 minutes for the doctor on our first visit. She talked to me as a new patient for about 7-10 minutes before prescribing meds. She said she would follow up with me after my bloodwork results came back in a couple of days. 11 days later I called the office and was told she would call me at 6 that evening but I never heard from her. I also did a COVID antibody test while I was there. Results were due back in 5 days. Again, 11 days later when I called, I was told it was positive and when I asked for the results to be emailed to me I was told that there was no toner in their printer and it would be done as soon as there was. Needless to say I have not received anything. Maybe she is a decent doctor when she has time for her patients. But she obviously did not have time for me. Extremely disappointing and I would never go to her again or recommend her to anyone I knew.< /text><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
She couldn't give less f#%$...When I came with a new issue I was not familiar with, she listened and asked ME what do I want her to do! You're the doctor, you should tell me what to do about it, that's why I came. The issue was not something unusual, it was a pretty common thing, I was hoping to get a directions on how to treat it. I felt super rushed. The whole process took no longer than 5 minutes even so I was waiting for her for about 50min or more. I mentioned also my chronic disease I was concerned about, because it requires treatment time by time. I wanted to get recommendations about it too. This part was just ignored. I didn't feel comfortable even talking about it, so I just left.</Review>

<Text>Used a lab that is out of network that she has a financial interest in. She also sent us a bill for the visit copay after we already paid it in the office. Had a telemed appointment that she flakes on but she of course made sure to bill $145 for it. for A simple $45 visit became >$400 simply because of her greed. She has multiple medical board actions. I have reported her fraudulent activity to blue shield and california consumer affairs (attorney general). Judging from her yelp reviews there is a very serious pattern. If you had a similar experience please report her to the DOJ website as well.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

<Review>Okay diagnosis wise. But horrible service and billing experience. After the visit they sent me a bill which we paid after going through insurance. And then 1 month later we get another bill saying charging us more. When we emailed back about the itemized bill and reports of our test, no response. You have to call their finance department and then they tell you it's showing different on their system and you don't owe that much you actually owe less. It's a mess.<//Review>< pictures>

I have been in Dr Bickman’s care since I was pregnant with my second son in 2015 and continue till this day. She is not only the most caring and genuine doctor that I have ever met but she is also the most comforting. Her bedside manner and confidence in that intense situation of giving birth is so comforting that words can not properly convey. She’s who you want watching over you when you are in need of a doctor. She is everything someone in her profession should be: Knowledgeable, caring and unpretentious. She is a huge part of a very happy moment in my life. Thank you for taking such good care of us when we needed you.< /Text>

GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!  Her office is filthy. Rooms equipment covered in dust which mean they do not follow required protocol for not only COVID but basic office cleanliness practices. DISGUSTING. Did not properly wear a mask during visits. Sells exorbitant COVID tests with result in 2 hours but results not received till the next day. Sells treatments, takes your money, then never supplies. Neglectful office more interested in making a buck than giving due diligence as a doctors office. Sad disappointment.<//text>

Smart doctor.  She knows what she is doing.  She listened to everything I had to say.   You can tell she is compassionate and kind too.   Office is beautiful and staff are very professional.   I will definitely return and refer her to my friends.   I can't wait to have her deliver my baby!!   She was wonderful.< /Review>

<Text>It’s always super nerve wracking to see a new doctor, but I had an easy time booking my first visit with Dr. Bickman online. When I got there, the wait wasn’t anything crazy, the office staff and nurse were friendly and efficient, and there is parking adjacent to the office. The doctor herself was great! Professional, but warm and she was able to answer all of my questions. I’ll definitely keep seeing her!< /Text>< Pictures>

Go elsewhere. I had to call the office every single day for 2 weeks to get a new prescription script for a medication I needed. Also, had to call the office to get MY test results and would've otherwise never heard from them about an really important test result I was waiting for. The front desk doesn't care about you and Dr. Bickman is far too busy and has way too many patients to invest her time into your health.<//text>

tl;dr - Dr. Bickman's office told me they would be able to meet my timeline for a move. It is now 1 month later, my insurance is only valid for 1 more week, and I still have not received the care I need.

--

I need to replace my IUD, and went to Dr. Bickman because of her high ratings. Upon checking in, I noticed 2 other patients were scheduled at the same time I was. I waited 1 hour to be seen, and was struck by how thin the walls in the appointment room were when I was escorted in. I could hear another woman family planning through the wall, with the doctor I was supposed to be speaking with 1 hour ago.

At the appointment, I wanted to learn more about new IUD options. Dr. Bickman replied "Why?" and discouraged me from asking questions about 5- or 10-year options. She also kept derailing to talk about my shirt, a bootleg concert tee, and didn't seem to be actively listening even when I tried to engage her about it. Instead, I was appalled to find she took out her phone and started googling photos of the artist on my shirt during my appointment.

Still, I needed my IUD replaced. I was instructed to wait for a call when the device arrives, and to contact the office in 2 weeks if I hadn't already been reached out to. I called 2 weeks later, and was told someone would return my call ASAP. I did not receive a call. Instead, it took 3 additional calls across 3 days  for me to learn my IUD was never ordered in the first place. Upon returning my third call, the receptionist kept me on the line and talked to the doctor as if I wasn't on the receiver. I thought this odd correspondence was a butt dial. (It wasn't.)

I informed the doctor a month ago that I would be moving within 5 weeks, and was told this process would only take 3 max. It has now been 3 weeks, and I may not be able to receive treatment before moving. Moreover, my insurance will no longer be valid when I leave the state, and I don't know how long it will be until I can be in a position to have effective birth control again. I still have an expired IUD inside me, and no replacement in sight. This has been a disappointing, stressful, saddening experience, and I am deeply hurt by Dr. Bickman and her office's inattention to her patient's needs.

I am still in contact with Dr. Bickman's office as I try to make this insertion possible before I move. I will update this review with the final time it takes to get treated (if at all.) I do not recommend this doctor for birth control needs.<//text>

I have scheduled two appointments with this office and they cancelled them both last minute.  I understand that things come up in the medical field but to have two appointments in a row cancelled with very little warning was frustrating.  The first appointment I called a few hours before my appointment because I got off a little early and asked if they happened to have anything sooner.  They informed me that the doctor probably could not see me at my scheduled time anyways because of a delivery but if I could get there in 45 minutes, I would be seen.  If I had not called, I would have driven all the way there just to be told I could not be seen.  Anyways, I was able to get there in 45 minutes.  I waited there for an hour before being roomed.  Waited another 15 minutes, only to be told that the doctor had to go to the delivery.  I had the option of waiting in hopes that it would be a quick delivery but chose not to take that chance.   The doctor reached out to me later that night apologizing which is why I chose to give them another chance.  I made another appointment.  The night before my morning appointment, I got a call saying they needed to cancel it due to the doctor having a few surgeries to do that day.  I would have appreciated at least a 24 hour heads up.  I did a lot of research to finding a doctor I thought would be a good fit for me and I am frustrated with my experience.< /Text>

Dr Bickman is THE BEST!! She is so experienced, knowledgeable and open - I can ask her any questions and know I’ll get a straight honest answer and I love that she doesn’t beat around the bush. She flawlessly delivered my child via c-section in an emergency situation and I still go to her today! Highly recommend!<//Text>

Dr Bickman is great. I’ve been to her office twice and each time she’s understanding, conversational, & professional. She’s truly the best, and yes I did have to wait lasts time for her expertise, but as always, it was worth it. To me, it makes her even more credible that I had to wait because she had to be there for one of her patients during an emergency surgery. If I ever needed an emergency surgery, I have a feeling she’d be there for me in the same way. Thanks for the great service, Dr Bickman!<//Review>

She is nice herself but there is just not enough time in the day for me to show up on time to an appointment and still sit here almost an hour after and still be sitting in the waiting room.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I had a terrible experience here—her staff is very incompetent with respect to the information they are giving to patients, their ability to handle time sensitive matters, and the fact that they are incredibly bad at answering the phone.

I waited for the doctor for about an hour with an appointment and was given poor medical advice. I would NOT recommend her as a medical professional since the information she gave me about my fertility was INCORRECT. This is literally her job and her field. I had to go to another doctor to get a second opinion and that doctor was in shock concerning the information Dr. Bickman gave me.

I tried speaking to Dr. Bickman about these issues directly but never heard from her.

Please go to another doctor. I can’t imagine being pregnant and having to deal with her incompetent staff, waiting times, and the fact that she is unaware of her own medical field. I’m  going to research filing a complaint due to the egregious nature of her medical opinion.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I had a great experience with Dr. Bickman. She is experienced, kind, compassionate, and a great communicator. Her office offers convenient hours, a clean waiting room, and friendly front desk staff. She went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and feel like my health concerns were being heard and addressed. I highly recommend Dr. Bickman!<//Text>

As a physician myself, I can say with confidence that you cannot possibly be in better hands. She is caring, experienced, safe, intelligent, and pretty much everything you would want in your OB/GYN. Unlike other doctors, Dr. Bickman does an ultrasound at every pregnancy visit and she does all of her own deliveries. During my pregnancy, I unexpectedly had a VERY rare condition (1/1000 pregnancies) that she caught immediately on ultrasound-- if she hadn't noticed it right away, it could have become dangerous. She sent me to the right specialist and followed up with me to make sure that everything turned out okay. Dr. Bickman is just a wonderful doctor and I feel so lucky to have had her look out for me!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb3534eaba4f:0x20ae16d680b4bac< /gmap_id></record>

Dr. Bickman is an incredible doctor. Not only did she get me right in as a new patient, she demonstrates excellent communication with her patients. She's helpful, caring and seems to give off the "I'm a cool doc vibe", along with being easy to talk to. I will cont to recommend her to others as a very satisfied patient.</text>

During my pregnancy and my subsequent visits- she listened to me, answered all my questions and took excellent care of me (and my baby).   She is very compassionate and  smart and generous.  Her staff is so sweet too and her office is fresh and clean.  I moved three years ago and   I travel from Oregon now to see her!   There is no one else I will trust with my care.

I love Dr. Bickman so much, I get emotional at times when I see her because 8 years ago she saved my unexpected difficult pregnancy @only 4 months from becoming a miscarriage. It was the scariest thing my husband and I have ever experienced and without a moment of doubt Dr. Bickman guided us out of this unexplained complication and near termination to a smooth continued pregnancy with not one issue and a beautiful 9lb 6oz baby boy. We could not be more grateful for her incredible knowledge and Zen-like calm (that must ONLY come from being a mother of 5 because I have never seen anything like it) and the fact that we have a fun super cute 8 year old son who keeps us laughing all day everyday.

She knows her patients well and cares deeply about their well being. I say that because then years later I had a simple routine check up, she saw an irregularity in my results, made phone calls to the best surgeons and with her Zen-like calm explained what needs to happen...she knew she needed to keep me from panicking as I do often and easily. Dr. Bickman made sure this top surgeon paid special attention to my case and had the surgery scheduled within 10 days from her discovery. The surgery took 2 hours, problem was over and solved that day. Never had a problem past that day. Grateful once again.

Now my 16 year old daughter sees her, loves her...thinks she is so cool and I'm now seeing the Zen-like calm mother adviser side of her that I never noticed before. There's nothing like having a female OBGYN who is good at what she does, has 5 babies herself and KNOWS about parenting from infants to adulthood. Her parenting advice is real! Dr. Bickman is a unique one of kind gem that is hard to find and truly knowledgeable for all stages of a woman's life and Wow, such a loving person to top it off.</text>

<Time>1555600682656<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Dr. Bickman is by far the best OBGYN I've ever had. I started seeing her half way through a high risk pregnancy, and she missed no steps and just jumped right in, being helpful and caring in every way. She delivered our son via c-section with no issues whatsoever, even though it was high risk and a million things could have gone wrong. She always makes you feel like you are the most important patient, takes time with you and answers any questions you may have. I had to bring my other kids to a few appointments and she welcomed them and was so kind and accommodating. The specialist she referred me to worked really well with her for the surgery as well, I wouldn't have wanted anyone else in the OR with me! The entire office staff is extremely kind and accommodating as well. I wouldn't use anyone else!< /Review>< Pics>

Dr Bickman is great.   I found her through an extensive search on line.   I am new to Los Angeles and needed a new doctor urgently.   I am very picky too.  I come from a family of doctors so I am very familiar with this industry.  I made an appointment on line.   Dr Bickman was great.   She knew exactly what my issue was, was fast to diagnose and treated me accordingly.   Her staff is very sweet and professional too.  The office is spotless.  Dr Bickman not only is medically very competent but she has a great bedside manner too.   I highly recommend her.    Search no further!<//Review>

Dr Bickman is wonderful. She is caring, gives you lots of information, makes you feel safe and supported. What more do you want from a Dr? I feel like nowadays lots of doctors are not particularly friendly, bedside manner seems to be going south. But Dr Bickman is one of those doctors that makes you feel warm and safe. She makes you feel like you matter and she cares about your wellbeing and health. That is exactly what I was looking for in a doctor. You can’t go wrong with her.</review>

My number one primary doctor in the US!!!
We met a year ago and she gave me the best treatment and treated me with at most care.
She is super professional and thorough.
I feel that I am in the best hands with Dr Bickman.
She is always available on all mediums of communication, so if it's an urgent situation, you can count on her to replay fast.
Thank god for Dr Bickman , She is a life saver.<//Text>

It was the worst patient experience I have ever had. Everything seemed fine in the beginning, despite the long, long, long waits and rushed visits, but in the end she tried manipulating me into an unnecessary induction. Her tactics were borderline unethical. I later found out she has a terrible reputation among the birthing community for pressuring and manipulating patients into medically unnecessary c-sections and inductions to accomodate her own schedule-- delivery nurses, other doctors, doulas, etc have all confirmed this. She clearly does not care for her patients. I will never return and am still recovering from the trauma of my birth experience almost two years later.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Dr Bickman is incredible.   I can't recommend her high enough.  She delivered my baby a few months ago and my experience with her was outstanding. (she has been my doctor for over five years)  I don't have single complaint.   Dr Bickman was committed to giving me the best care and safest delivery.   I have felt totally confident in her hands and extremely well taken care of.  She listened to me at each visit and took her time.   I never felt rushed or not listened to.   She is attentive (emails and calls promptly) and her bed side manner is kind and compassionate. If you want outstanding medical care with a warm and friendly doctor (this doesn't exist anymore), then see Dr Bickman.   She is the best!   And I have known her for over five years!<//Text>

<review>I have done all the research for you.   I extensively researched Dr Bickman before I went to see her.  I wanted to make sure she was qualified and all respected and experienced.   Not only did I get this, but I got an amazing doctor who is kind, thorough and professional.   She managed my unexpected high risk pregnancy so well.  She caught some issues early and saved my life and my baby's too.   I could have had residual medical problems but Dr Bickman was so vigilant and attentive and she made sure I was safe and my baby too.   I credit her with my family.  I would wait all day to see her.  She is worth every minute.  There is a reason she is busy- because she is the best!  I can't say enough good things about her.  Trust me and all my hours of research.   Dr Bickman will take the best care of you- in pregnancy or for gynecological issues.   She is hands-down the best of the best!</review><name>juliet anderson<//name>< Response>

Highly recommend Dr. Bickman. I was pregnant when we met. She answers all my questions and she delivered my baby via C-section. And I can say my scar looks amazing, it’s right below my binki line. So no one will ever see it. She's super kind and very gentle. If I ever have another baby I will be seeing her !!!!<//text>

I was lucky enough to be introduced to Dr. Bickman before I was pregnant with my second child.  I had been looking for someone who could help me have the healthiest pregnancy possible, after having the experience of delivering a child prematurely.  Dr. Bickman always took the time to listen to my needs and concerns, and helped me feel at ease when I often felt unsettled.  I am a super sensitive person who often over thinks things (especially while pregnant;) and has difficulty making decisions. Dr. Bickman had the ability to confidently assert her beliefs and present multiple options in a professional manner while still allowing me to make the best decision for my baby, myself and my family when things felt out of control.  Sometimes in the office there were long waits and one appointment was re-scheduled due to a delivery, but I knew that when it was my turn with her that she would take her time and make sure that all of my questions were answered, even if I was the last appointment and she wanted to get home to her family.  While some people might view that as an inconvenience, it was reassuring to me to know that once I went into labor she would do everything and anything to make sure she was there.  When it was delivery time (at 5 am on a Sunday), she came in, helped me be at ease, and was a dynamo in the delivery room! My husband was so impressed and surprised that this 5 foot-something woman just rocked the delivery and made it look so easy.  She was very thorough and encouraging, which was calming to me since my baby was quite large:)  All in all, the office staff is always kind, helpful and accommodating and somehow manages to keep their cool when things are running behind schedule and patients become a little cranky.  Now when I go in for regular appointments I know that sometimes there might be a wait, BUT it is always for a good reason:)  If I was pregnant and needed a few extra minutes or there was an emergency, Dr. Bickman would do what was best for both my baby and for me.  I am so thankful to have found her.  If you are searching for a new OB/GYN, you should set up an appointment and see if it is the right fit for you.</text>

Dr Bickman is amazing.   She is one of the last,  "I really care about my patients" doctors!! I found her (luckily) on line after extensive searching.   Look no further.   I have done the research for you.   Dr Bickman is wonderful.   She made me feel so comfortable when I was having a problem.   She knew just what to do.  She handled my situation perfectly.   She is confident, kind and professional.   Her bedside manner is great too!  I got a same day appointment and have been seeing her ever since.   Her staff is also really nice and her office is spotless.   You can tell from the minute you meet her, Dr Bickman actually cares about you as a patient, you are not just a number.   SO rare these days!   If you want a smart, compassionate and professional doctor , see Dr Bickman!<//Text>

Dr Bickman is incredible.   I rarely write reviews but I felt I needed to this time.   I want other people to know how wonderful my experience with Dr Bickman has been.   I have known her for a very long time and will only see her.   She is smart,  experienced,  kind and passionate about her profession.   She listens to me every time and always takes her time with me at visits.   Doctors like her do not exist anymore.  I have never felt rushed or not listened to.    Dr Bickman actually cares deeply for her patients and it shows.   She delivered a baby for me recently and I was the most incredible journey ever with Dr Bickman.    I looked forward to each visit and am so sad I won't be seeing her so much any more.   My delivery was also amazing.   I was so well taken care of and I knew always that my baby and I were always safe and in the best hands possible.    Please see Dr Bickman if you want a professional, amazing, kind and one of a kind doctor.    Doctors like her are very hard to find!<//Text>

<text>Dr Bickman has been my Dr for 8 years. She delivered my son 7 years ago.  She is always there to answer my questions and concerns. The best thing about her office is she can help you from the inside by offering the MonaLisa treatments and believe me ladies, we all need this treatment after childbirth.  Then too help you look rested on and refreshed, her nurse can  inject your botox too give you that natural not done look.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2bb3534eaba4f:0x20ae16d680b4bac</GmapID></record>

If it weren’t for Dr Bickman, I would not have my 2 beautiful children!  She helped me navigate fertility problems,  miscarriage and then 2 healthy pregnancies.  I can never repay her.  I appreciate her direct bedside manner on most days and her compassion and hope when I needed it.  She is a great doctor- you will be well taken care of and the best part is she delivers your baby herself which was a top priority for my peace of mind.  I wanted to know the doctor who was going to guide me thru such an important day in my life.  You will not find a better doctor- I will continue to see her for as long as I live here (and maybe even when I don’t).<//Review>

If you have an appointment for a set time be prepared to wait about two hours in the waiting room before getting called into a room. It’s a one woman private practice; I get the Dr. is trying to make as much money as possible but it’s absolutely ridiculous to keep people waiting that long at every single appointment. So be sure to plan your whole day based around one appointment.< /review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Bickman’s for over 5 years. She is very knowledgeable and I have had nothing but positive experiences with her.  I love her care and recommend her to everyone I can!

Dr. Bickman is always accessible.  You can email her and get an immediate response, which I have never experienced before and love!  It is nice to have an option to ask questions outside of your appointment if you forgot something or something new has come up.  During your appointment, she takes her time with you and answers all of your questions as well.  She never made me feel like my questions were trivial or stupid.  You get a straightforward answer and leave feeling well informed and confident.

Dr. Bickman delivered my two beautiful daughters.  I always felt I was in good hands and well taken care of.  During your pregnancy you see your doctor a lot and I really enjoyed our time together, in fact now that my post pregnancy appointments are over - I miss her!  She is a wonderful, caring person who is nice to be around as well☺.</text>

<review>Dr Bickman is amazing.  She is the kindest, smartest, most conscientous
doctor I have ever been to.  I was having a really hard time getting pregnant, and had been to three other doctors.  My friend recommended her.  She listened to me and realized that there were some tests that needed to be done.   We did the tests methodically and thoroughly.  As a result, I am thrilled to say, I am now 8 weeks pregnant!!  I credit Dr Bickman's careful care and experience with helping me to get the family I've always dreamed of.   We are so grateful to her and are so excited to have her deliver my baby (and she does all her own deliveries!).   I can't say enough good things about Dr Bickman's outstanding care and compassion.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I think Dr. Bickman is a wonderful doctor. She saw me through my first pregnancy and delivered my son. At every appointment she answered all of my questions and never once made me feel embarrassed for them. She was always pleasant and chatted with me before and after the exam.

I did have to wait a long time for a few appointments, but I understood this was a possibility going in as she personally delivers all her patients' babies. It was worth it to me.

Thank you Dr. Bickman!!<//text>

Dr Bickman is the best!   Worth the wait!!!   She sees all her own patients, takes her time with you and listens.  If you want a fast big group rotating practice she is NOT FOR YOU.  Dr Bickman prides herself on seeing all her own patients and delivering all her own patients too!   This is incredible and almost extinct these days with the awful healthcare systems.  If you have to wait she is worth it!    I trust her implicitly and can't wait for her to deliver my second baby together.  You must see her :)< /Text>

Choosing your OB-gyn can be a very difficult decision.  I researched and researched and researched.  I asked friends and colleagues and other doctors and after an extensive search I chose Dr Bickman.  I am so glad I did.  She saved my baby's life.   I owe her with everything.   I am infuriated at reading some of these reviews which are clearly fabricated or these people are delusional.   Dr Bickman is the safest, smartest most competent doctor I have ever been to.  She is also kind and compassionate with amazing bedside manner.   Sometimes there is a little wait to see her but that because she is amazing and worth the wait!
She listens and is thorough and is there for you no matter when, no matter what she is doing or the time of day.  She emails and texts at all hours of the day.   She is the most responsive doctor too!   It is so clear that she cares deeply for her patients and this is her passion.   If you want the best doctor ever , go see her!    She is incredible.  You will not be disappointed.  Ignore the crazy inaccurate reviews and see the safe, passionate, smart doctor, Dr Bickman.< /review>

Dr Bickman is an incredible doctor.  She is one of the last of the old-school, "I actually care about my patients" doctor.   She sees all her patients herself.  If you are pregnant she will see you every time and be there for your delivery.  This is so rare now, with medical care changes.   Dr Bickman took care of me for my pregnancy and delivered my baby perfectly.   Dr Bickman is super smart and safe and made sure everything was right and nothing was overlooked during my pregnancy.   The delivery was also perfect!  I highly recommend Dr Bickman, whether you are looking for someone to take care of you for your pregnancy or for a general gynecologist.   I have had her for both and she is the best!<//Review>

Incredible.   Dr Bickman is the warmest, kindest doctor I have seen in a long time.  She is old-school.   Not a big group practice with many doctors.  You are a patient with a face and a story.  I have felt so cared for and listened to and taken care of.  Dr Bickman clearly has been doing this for a long time.  She helped me by listening and caring and treating properly.  She has done for me what many other doctors gave up on.  She didn't give up on me.   I am a very difficult case but Dr Bickman handled me perfectly.   I am so grateful to her and her amazing, diligent care.   If you want a doctor that actually listens to you as a person with a story, then got see Dr Bickman.  She is one a the few last true practitioners who actually cares about her patients.    She is so passionate about her work.  She is incredible.</text>

everytime i show up to my appointment on time, i have to wait over 1.5 hours to be seen. on top of this long wait, i do not get a proper thorough visit each time. my needs are not heard, in fact i am ASKED what brand of birth control i want to be on, versus helping me select the right one suiting my needs which is why i made the appointment in the first place.

now i am prescribed a high dose birth control, which is exactly what i didn’t want. i did not know what i was prescribed until i researched myself on google what dosage i was taking. absolutely not wasting anymore money on co payments to not be properly consulted.

if you are not pregnant you will not receive any attention. switching doctors immediately.<//text>

I made an appointment with Dr Bickman because I was having issues that no one could figure out.  She spent a lot time with me and listened to me carefully.  After being very thorough and helpful,  I feel back to normal again!  I am so grateful for Dr Bickman.  Three other doctors in Santa Monica couldn't figure my problem out and she did!  If you want a smart, compassionate and patient doctor, go see Dr Bickman.  She is a lifesaver!</Review>

< Review>
Dr. Bickman is an amazing doctor.  I have been a patient of hers for years and have had nothing but great experiences with her.  When I was just seeing her annually for my check-up, she was quick and always remembered me and a couple things about me.  I’ve had doctors before her I only saw annually and I felt like I was reintroducing myself each time.  With Dr. Bickman I felt like I was building on a relationship.

When I got pregnant with my son last year is when I realized how lucky I was that Dr. Bickman was our doctor.  From the start when we found out we were further along than we thought we were till the end when we started having complications and I was put on bed rest, I got nothing but the best care, straightforward answers and absolute confidence that if things went south she was the one I wanted by my side to take charge of the situation.  She has a million different things going on and when she is in the room with you, she is very present. She listens and answers all questions (yes even the silly ones) thoroughly and without making you feel stupid.  She even humored my very anxious husband who accompanied me to all appointments making the same joke each time.

One of the great things about her is she likes to communicate via email, which really worked for us (see answers silly questions) because she is always quick to respond to every email without making you feel like you’re bothering her.

She is straightforward with what she is telling you and won’t sugarcoat things, which we appreciated, because the way she does it is very reassuring.  Yes you will wait, but she is delivering babies and dealing with emergencies associated with that, if you were the one with the emergency you would want her there for you.  If waiting is an issue, you can always call ahead & see how backed up they are or schedule an early appointment.< /Review>

Dr. Tristan Bickman is AMAZING! She has helped me so much with my endometriosis and I feel so much better. She is fully committed to my overall health and even called me to make sure I was doing well. I am SO happy to have found Dr. Bickman! Highly recommend if you want an OB/GYN who is dedicated to her patients and makes you feel like a VIP :)< /Text>

<Text>I have gone to so many doctors with my problem and no one was able to help me, and then I met Dr Bcikman. She listened to my problems and actually took the time and cared. With her expertise and patience, I am better!  I am so grateful to Dr Bickman.   If you want a doctor that actually cares- go see her.  There are so many doctors now who just want to get you in and out that they dont spend the time and listen. not Dr Bickman!  She is amazing.  She knew exactly how to help me.  I am so glad I found her.  I will never see anyone else!<//Text>< Pics>

I'm giving 1 star to this person because unfortunately I can't give 0 stars. Sadly we decided to go with Dr. Bickman for my wife's whole pregnancy, and we couldn't have had a worse experience. In fact my wife barely got out of it alive.

Throughout all the of the pre-natal care, Bickman was always very dismissive and clearly trying to rush appointments as much as possible. She's terrible with answering questions and just has an overall lack of care about her patients. Her front desk staff and nurses are rude and standoffish as well.

During the actual deliver day, Bickman took a series of very poor medical decisions and basically subjected my wife to a STAGGERING 55 HOURS OF LABOR, before finally agreeing to do a C-section. At that point my wife was hooked into the drip for such a long time that her body couldn't absorb all the liquid which ended up in her lungs giving her a very dangerous pulmonar edema and also a sepsis infection for being in labor for so long. This is serious stuff that can easily kill someone.

Both the mother and baby had to be rushed to the ICU and stayed there for 2 weeks. Thankfully they ended up getting out of the hospital and are well now.

She’s an awful doctor, so I couldn’t stress this more: DON’T COME HERE AND DON’T WAIST YOUR TIME WITH HER.

It seems like there are a few positive reviews here, so I'm not sure if she just decided to be nasty to us in particular? Maybe it's because we are immigrants or something? I really have no clue, but she's a terrible, terrible professional and has put my family's lives in danger. I hope I never see her again and that she ends up losing her medical license which she clearly doesn't deserve.<//Text>

I made a same day appointment, which I feel is really rarely given. Many places with great reviews have a waitlist of 3 weeks sometimes and sometimes you just don't have 3 weeks to wait!

The wait was about an hour long, which is not that bad when in comparison to all doctors' offices...because all doctors' offices run behind schedule.

I felt really comfortable with Dr. Bickman. The best part is that she checked in on me that evening to make sure I picked up my prescriptions and was feeling better.< /review>

I actually ended up moving across town mid-pregnancy but kept Dr. B because I couldn't imagine someone else delivering my baby.
Dr. B is very busy and has a lot of patients but she always made me feel like I was her only one. She listened to my concerns and she was always very responsive to be via email over anything I had questions on.
Also- How many private practice OB's do you know that deliver every single one of their patients babies? As a mom of 5 herself, she knows how it feels to bring a baby into this world and and she gave me all the confidence, reassurance and tools I needed to feel safe throughout my entire pregnancy and delivery. I also went past my due date and not once did she ever pressure me into induction- something I REALLY valued.
Definitely go see Dr. B for all of your OBgyn needs :)</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< GmapID>

Dr. Bickman is an incredible MD and OBGYN. She has a reputation for her attentiveness and service to her patients. This is important to note as she runs a  busy office and at times there is a wait. Let me tell you as a patient she is worth the wait! She completely extends herself and her time to you. Her office responds to calls and emails which makes it  easy to communicate with her. I live in West Hollywood, work in Beverly Hills and she is still my preferred choice in doctor.<//Text>

<review>If you need a new Ob-gyn, run, don't walk to Dr Bickman.  She has been my go-to doctor for many years.  She is smart, to the point test compassionate and kind.  She has helped me with a long history of gynecological problems.  She was the first doctor to actually listen to me and my history and not just throw medicine at me.  The treatment plan took time, but in the end I am better!  Dr Bickman was the first doctor who actually took a thorough history and physical and as a result she "fixed"me.  I am so grateful to Dr Bickman for her care.  If you want a doctor who actually listens to you and takes her time, see Dr Bickman.  (her staff is amazing too!)<//review>< Gmap_id>

I absolutely love and trust Dr. Bickman. She is so knowledgeable, down to earth, and capable. She always makes time to answer any and all questions I may have, whether in the office or via email. I love that she conducts an ultrasound during every appointment, as it really creates a visual connection between mom and baby. i highly recommend Dr. Bickman, and trust her implicitly.</text>

Let’s face it, nobody likes to go in for their well woman exam. I had Kaiser for years and had different doctors for each visit. Now that I’m not part of Kaiser anymore, I got a referral from a client for Dr Bickman. The name sounded so familiar because many of my clients also go to her. I decided to make an appointment. Dr Bickman was warm, personable, interested in me and my family history. She took the time necessary to review my background and date I say it was the quickest, most comfortable exam of my life. Thank you Dr Bickman. You and your Staff run a smooth sailing ship over there and I’m a happy customer. Thank you!<//text>

I moved across the country at 20 weeks with my first and she was referred to us by close friends. She is extremely responsive to any questions you have, and easy to contact with via email or phone. Dr. Bickman is a wonderful doctor; straightforward and patient. Both of my babies had to be delivered via c section and I would not have wanted anyone else to be in the OR. My recovery was made easier because she is truly a skilled surgeon. I continue to see her for check ups and recommend her to all of my friends.<//Review>< Name>

<Text>I love Dr. Bickman. I moved to LA two months before my son was born and she took us on. Ever since she has been my OB/GYN and I have actually looked forward to seeing her every year. She is busy so very fast, but gives wonderful life advice during the visits. She is a great doctor and inspiring woman.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>107473349205676199448<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Horrific customer service - nobody called me back after numerous emails and phone calls. I even called today after I got back from out of town and tried to book an emergent appointment after bleeding for two and a half weeks, but was out of town for a death in the family. I was told she was "unavailable" and very indifferently that she couldn't see me until Friday. When I asked why my phone calls and emails weren't returned, she sighed and did not answer. I told her I would go somewhere else. This is absolutely unacceptable. I guess if you're not having a baby and have an issue -- this isn't the place to go.</text>

Dr. Bickman is an amazing MD and person. Always making herself available to her patients, she is down to earth, straightforward and honest, knowledgeable and caring - I could not have asked for a better doctor to entrust my prenatal care, the deliveries of my children and my overall women’s health.<//text>

<userid>106042976907822388852<//userid><review>I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Bickman.  She’s an incredible doctor and person.  I’ve been Dr. Bickman’s patient for over a decade.  She delivered my son and made some important decisions at critical moments that literally saved his life.  Without Dr. Bickman’s wisdom and excellent care, we would not have our wonderful, healthy son today.  She’s an experienced and very, very good physician.  She is also 100% available to her patients when you need her.  And when you are pregnant and have critical questions at 3 am (which happened to me several times), it’s really amazing to be able to connect right to Dr. Bickman.  You are not routed to a nurse or a different on-call doctor that you’ve never spoken with… you always reach Dr. Bickman.  I don’t know how she does it, but she is always available when you need her.  My dad is a doctor as well and he has always been so impressed by the care I have received from Dr. Bickman.  I have absolute confidence in Dr. Bickman – and infinite gratitude for the care we have received.</review>< name>

Dr. Bickman is absolutely amazing! I found her through my primary care physician when I became pregnant with my daughter. She held my hand through a first pregnancy plagued by disability, diabetes, and much more. Even though I saw her once a week, I never felt like a nuisance or that I couldn't ask her a question. She was readily available to me via phone or email for my gazillion questions. Since having my daughter, she still answers any questions and follows up with me on a regular basis. My only hope is that I get to have Dr. Bickman deliver all of my future children! I can not say enough nice things about her!< /Review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Bickman’s for over 4 years. I’ve had to have a emergency procedure, hormonal imbalances with my PCOS and have had a IUD placed. All of which have gone well thanks to her. I have never had a doctor who would call or email me the night after my procedures to check on me and make sure I was okay. I have now sent 3 friends to her and everyone LOVES her. I wish I was living here forever so she could eventually deliver my babies. Thanks Dr. Bickman for everything.< /text>

<time>1211241033410<//time><Text>I have seen Dr. Bickman twice now for routine annual check-ups.  I really like her and have no plans to change.

Pros:  easy to make appointment, I've never had to wait long, visit is quick, office is clean, staff is friendly.

Cons: I haven't figured out the best parking yet, but the garage parking is pricey and they don't validate.  This is not the place for people who need a lot of hand holding attention.  She's not rude, but have had doctors who spend more time explaining procedures.  She's not the type to warn before putting in the speculum, for example.<//Text><response>None<//response><rate>4</rate>< Pics>

<Review>When i found out i was pregnant i googled “Best OBGYN on the Westside” and made an appointment. I got In right away. The second i met Her i knew I wanted Her to deliver my baby. She was kind, attentive, smart, and really cared. I saw Her regularily for checks on the baby and each time she answered all of my questions and helped me feel comfortable during the whole pregnancy. When i hit My third trimester i was Having some pain one night and my husband took me to the ER where they found a blood clot in my leg. She was in contact with the doctors there that late night and was in communication with me that following week via email and phone. After i got Diagnosed with dvt my Hemotologist was recommending i have A c section. I was scared to have a c section and it wasn’t my original plan but Dr. Bickman was very supportive through the whole process and was very accommodating to what i needed And wanted for the birth. I ended Up having the c section because of the Hemotologist’s recommendation. The scar looks so good! I’m 3 months out and don’t even notice it anymore. Everyone i show it to (including others that have one as well) are very impressed with how good it looks. Dr. Bickman still follows up with me and answers any questions i may Have via email and gets back to me super quick. She impressed the hell out of me through this whole process and still does! Anyone who sees her knows that she’s very busy and has a lot on her plate but she still manages to give her patients a five star experience. I think Her brain functions on a higher level than most of us.

Side note:  Since meeting doctor Bickman i have Found out that a handful of other mothers i know Have gone to her and we all talk about how amazing  she is. 👌🏻

Also... i know Some people have mentioned the wait. I too Have waited in her office at times but it is so worth the care she gives her patients. People can’t be in two places at once. If you want a doctor to tend to you and your baby when you need it you’re going to have to wait when they are doing that for other patients etc.. i would Rather wait sometimes than have a doctor who Isn’t there when i need Them.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

<review>I just recently moved to LA and was in search of a new OB-GYN. I was referred to Dr. Bickman by a friend and was extremely pleased with my visit last week. Dr. Bickman is a fantastic doctor. She is personable yet efficient and always accessible for questions/concerns via email and the phone. She is very accommodating to flexible scheduling. I'll definitely be returning to Dr. Bickman as well as referring her to my friends and family.</review>< Pics>

Dr. Bickman has zero ethics so please be cautious when selecting her to treat you.  You will wait for 2 hours or more and she will spend 10 minutes with you and encourage you to buy or prescribe to things you don't need.  She is running a sketchy business not a medical practice.  She lies to her patients and please  believe me you should NOT trust her.<//text>

I found Dr. Bickman's practice to be very unprofessional. My first visit was cancelled morning of, and when I rescheduled my wait time was over an hour with no explanaiton. After my first appointment, they failed to give me any of my lab/visit results.They also failed to respond to any of my emails/calls in a timely manner.

Wouldn't go back here if someone paid me. They also filter all their Google reviews so only the good ones actually get posted.< /review>

Dr. Bickman provided exceptional care throughout my recent pregnancy. She always put my mind at ease as she patiently answered my many questions about the pregnancy during our appointments and responded with kindness and compassion to those issues that truly concerned us. It was especially helpful that she is super accessible over email, answering my frantic questions at all hours!

I always felt very confident in her recommendations, which she delivers in a direct, concise and clear manner. Her direction was spot on and kept me healthy during the pregnancy, got me into the hospital at just the right time, and helped me through a very challenging labor and delivery during which my baby was in distress. She was calm and completely in control of a very scary situation and was able to coach me through a natural delivery of our perfect baby girl.

My husband and I would not have wanted our daughter’s life in anyone else’s hands and are eager to return for baby #2!< /text>

<user_name>D2G< /user_name><Review>I did my research before I transferred to her and from what I've learned she's on the top list of the best doctors here in Santa Monica. I was having my regular check ups at another state before I came to Dr. Bickman and from my first visit with her I already felt the emotional connection which I never had with my previous OBGYN. I guess it has something to do with the gender because my previous was a male doctor. Also she is very helpful and patient answering my questions and my husband's even if some aren't about pregnancy at all. We also bought a book from her entitled "Whoa, Baby!", and I find it really informative... So far so good 👍🏼</Review><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

If I could give this woman lower than one star I would. The experience I had was absolutely the worst  I have ever had. I waited 2.5 hours to see her and she was beyond rude. The first thing she said to me was”i didnt even look at your file, whats going on”. Any questions I asked her she disregarded and was not informative as to what is wrong. She asked if I had any hereditary problems which I told her I have a blood disorder in which she replied “well who’s going to want to operate on someone with a blood disorder”. She ended up taking another ultrasound then crumpling up the photos right after. She then went onto saying “do you need pain killers or something? A cyst of this size shouldnt be causing you any pain”. When I asked of what my options were she said “tough it out or what do you want me to take you into surgery right now?”.

Overall, she was dismissive and nothing was accomplished that I didnt already know. Her advice was to come back in 4 weeks but I definitely will not be seeing her again.<//Text>

She is rude and makes people wait for a long. She also gave no information on an infection. Very unprofessional.<//Review>

I'm feel fortunate to have been a patient of Dr. Bickman for many years. I love that she is a very approachable and knowledgable person. She is extremely hard working and truly loves what she does. I have always had very quick replies from her via email and I've been her patient for many years. She wants the best for her patients and makes every effort to provide quality care. I was so pleased with the delivery of my baby with her at Santa Monica UCLA.
I've seen her for everything...standard gym annuals, OBGYN related concerns and prenatal, labor and delivery. The woman is on it! I'm so glad I found her!< /Review>

I love this doctor! I always enjoy visiting her. She's knowledgable, down to earth, and funny. Her appointment wait times can be long but it's totally worth it because she delivers all the babies! Dr. Bickman also provided superb aftercare of my cesarean. Three weeks ppd and my incision site looks beautiful. She's an artist!.< /review>

<Text>I went to dr bickman for the first 5 months. I asked her if she promoted "natural" birth because that was what I wanted. I eventually switched to a midwife program at UCLA and when they found out I was with Dr Bickman they were shocked, saying she was just the opposite.

My second beef with her is that she reviewed my 20 week ultrasound and did an ultrasound each visit. Not once did she tell me there was anything wrong nor did she have it in her notes. Because of this I I told UCLA all was good on my ultrasounds so they didn't do any additional ultrasounds and Bickman's notes after looking at my ultrasound said I was normal. IT took my new office over a month to get Bickman to send my paperwork over and Bickman failed to note that there was an issue with my pregnancy. I ended up losing the baby in my 9th month, and while it wasn't Dr Bickman's fault directly, it turns out that the placenta was precariously placed (something she would have seen in my 20 week ultrasound) and if they had not read in her notes that everything was normal it would have required additional monitoring and ultrasounds.

Third issue is the wait time. I got there about 15 minutes early each time and always stayed over 2 hours, even when I had an 8:30am appointment! How does she get so far behind after only one patient?

Last issue was how rude she was when I told her I was switching prenatal care. She just stopped talking, did my ultrasound and said "do you have any questions" before walking out.

I had my second child also with the midwives as they were so caring and wonderful to work with, especially after coming from Dr. Bickman. She was never super "nice" so I can only imagine what my grieving process would have been like with her. At least with the midwives they were great comforters and they told me straight up what had happened, knowing I could also blame them for not double checking Dr Bickman's work.</Text><Rate>2< /Rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<text>Dr. Bickman's advertisement popped up in my Facebook feed, and I was impressed with what I saw on her site in terms of helping woman who are transitioning into menopause. Since my OBGYN had retired, I was ready to make a change. My experience with her office, staff, and her lack of follow through was completely unprofessional.
PRO: The only pro was the ability to get an appointment right away.
CONS: Clearly overbooked with pregnant women filling every chair when I walked in at 8:30am. Between waiting and my appointment, I was there over 2 hours!  This is just not acceptable.
*as a new patient, they didn't weigh me, take my vitals signs, blood pressure, etc.,nada!
*Dr. Bickman did meet with me, but didn't do an pelvic exam on me.  As a new patient, don't you need to do this?!
*Dr. Bickman was attentive, yet rushed during our appointment.  She asked me how I was feeling and about my symptoms. She requested that I give blood and told me it would take about a week for the results.  She gave me her opinion on the Mona Lisa Touch, and quoted me $900 for one procedure, and said I might only need one. I called around, and everyone else in the city advertises a series of 3 as a protocol, and not just one!
*The office isn't as new and clean as I'm used to. She doesn't have proper chairs where you can lay your arm flat to give blood. The nurse had to pull my arm up from the chair and onto a counter to take blood. Very awkward and not easy to find a vein this way!
*After 2 weeks, I hadn't heard anything from the doctor, so I called the office and asked if my blood work was in.  The receptionist who answered the phone was so sick and could barely speak without coughing.  She told me yes, my blood work was in, and the doctor would call me around 7:00pm-8:00pm.  The doctor never called me back, but the sick receptionist did and told me my results were consistent with a woman in menopause.  She said the doctor would call me back.  She never did.
*Today 3/14/2018 I walked into the office this afternoon and asked for my medical records.  I signed all the papers and was told it would take 2 weeks.  When asked why it would take two weeks to pull my file, photocopy just 2 pages-my mammogram and blood work and hand to me-I was told it had to be signed off by the doctor LOL!  Judging by the stacks of paperwork everywhere, the overbooked office, and the lack of follow through in getting a call back regarding my blood work, I doubt I will ever see my medical records.  I will be calling Blue Shield and filing a complaint with them regarding my sub-par experience with this office. Clearly, woman who are entering menopause are not the cash cows like the young pregnant women.  I realize you are not going to make big bucks off of an appointment and a prescription, but we women over 50 are real people, the care takers of the world, who are going through an important phase in life. We should be taken care of and not treated like an after thought.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2bb3534eaba4f:0x20ae16d680b4bac< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I strongly recommend anyone to choose another OB/GYN. I got a treatment that was supposed to be fully reimbursed by my healthcare insurance provider. It was confirmed with both sides. Dr Bickman's office took $1200 from me in cash. Cigna was supposed to reimburse on my account (that what the DR's office told me). While the Dr's office got the money from Cigna and refused to give it back to me. After a month of disputes they were trying to convince they will return smaller amount. After next month, after engaging Cigna and writing a complaint letter to Dr Bickman directly, they returned the money. Healthcare insurance company was stating from the beginning that the responsibility of the patient is zero dollars. They acted really disrespectfully. I will never go there again.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Love her!  I was looking for a new OBGYN aLove her!  I was looking for a new OBGYN about a year ago and was referred to Dr. Bickman by a good friend of mine.  Funny that before I was able to make my first appointment for a yearly exam, i was pregnant!  Dr. Bickman was super personable and "real" during every visit.  She has a super warm heart and also tells it like it is.  She delivered my beautiful baby boy this past October and I actually miss my reoccurring visits with her now!  Parking can be an total pain.  Look for 2hr street parking as the lot is expensive, the office does not validate, and wait time can sometimes be a little long.  I assume it's because she's great and in very high demand!   That said, when you're in your appointment, she is not rushed at all and puts you at ease with any worries.  Additionally, I have to add, I received an ultrasound and could see my baby during every single appointment throughout my pregnancy, which I know is not always the norm!  I would definitely recommend Dr. Bickman!< /Review>

<review>DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR.  Dr. Bickman  runs the practice of giving unnecessary lab tests, bills for procedures that you don't even have, and then when you call to challenge them the office gives you the runaround and the BIckman ignores your emails, ignores your calls and basically does not answer to your complaints. My daughter had a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND IS LEFT WITH HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF BILLS FOR TESTS THAT WERE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!!!  FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR!</review>< pictures>

I was referred to her by a friend who had seen her for years and I plan to do the same. After a traumatic labor six years ago with a midwife I had many fears. Dr Bickman guided me through pregnancy and labor with such ease. In august we welcomed a healthy baby boy as well as Dr Bickman into our family.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<rate>5</rate><review>I have been seeing Dr. Bickman for over three years.  She is an incredible doctor who is very knowledgeable in her field.  I was referred there by a friend and have since referred several of my own friends who are also quite happy with her.  I have had fertility and loss issues and Bickman has been nothing but supportive.  I really feel that not only did she care, but more importantly, she knew what she was doing.  I have since delivered a healthy baby boy, mostly thanks to her.

Dr. Bickman is one of the best in her field.  She is an incredible doctor and skilled surgeon.  Her confidence is very reassuring when dealing with all the unknowns attached to pregnancy and birth.  I love her bedside manner.  She is to the point and incredibly knowledgeable.  Any questions I had she was always happy to answer.  Further, she is also very prompt in replying to emails.  This is very reassuring as it seems all the emergencies tend to happen after hours.  Bottom line, I would never switch doctors!<//review>< Pics>

Dr Bickman immediately helped me and treated me with the respect that every patient deserves.

Dr. Bickman has been my OB for a few years now and I love her. She always makes me feel welcome and she's always on the ball with my healthcare needs. When I had to have a C Section with my daughter, she really impressed me in the OR. My incision scar is very small and she was very thorough in regards to my health after delivery. My husband and I plan to have more children and we will definitely be delivering with Dr. Bickman!!!</review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I regret not reading some of these reviews before hand. Had a horrible experience with visiting Dr. Bickman. Her staff called in the wrong prescription for me which lead to me being billed $225 that is non-refundable. I waited 45 mins past our scheduled appointment time to see her, and she spoke with me in a rushed manner, and didn't seem to care about me at all.

She never even gave her staff the prescription she told me she would, I had to follow up with a phone call, which was where the misunderstanding occurred and led me to be sent a drug I don't intend to take, and being billed $225 for it.

I have no doubt based off other patience's previous experiences I will hear no response from her, and there will be no apology for her misconduct and poor patient relations. Please save yourself the hassle and find another doctor.< /Review>< pics>

Dr Bickman is a wonderful OBGYN. I was able to book an appointment on the same day and did not have to wait. Not only does she follow up on my labwork and contacted me how I am doing, but she did this also after office hours. Going through menopause is not easy, and I am very happy to have found with Dr Bickman a doctor who really cares and will help me through this transition. Thank you !< /review>

<review>I searched high and low for a trustworthy OB-GYN, and thought I'd found a keeper in Dr. Bickman.  Unfortunately, she is not very responsive after your initial appointment, and equally as troubling, the inaccurate billing practices.  Following this most recent visit, I've been forced me to resume my search for a trusted medical practitioner.<//review>< Time>

<review>Would leave a negative star if I could. After losing our child, the offices of DR. Bickman have been absolutely aloof and unreachable. My husband did a progenity blood test and its been about 6 months with no results... I have emailed her numerous times to get these results and have been ignored. I won't even go into the absolute horror my D&C was. Having adequate insurance and coverage which covered everything I did with Dr. Bickman, I have been sent to collections for mystery bills. Bill that wont tell me what I am being billed for. When I ask Dr. Bickman and her staff  about the bills I have only been ignored over and over again. This woman runs a chop shop, get as many people in an out. She honestly does not respond to any emails, or questions. The staff has no idea what they are billing you for, and when you ask them to clarify they disappear. Honestly the worst experience with any doctor. Lets just say my day tomorrow is sourcing lawyers to deal with the utter incompetence and disregard from the offices of Dr. Tristan Emily Bickman.< /review><UserId.>109405992988651462406</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely terrible.  Ran unnecessary tests, treated me for things that didn't need treatment, made me wait at least 1.5 hours past each apt time, billed me for things that never happened, refused to send me copies of my lab results,  didn't answer my emails or return my calls.  WORST doctors experience of my life.  Now I am dealing with $1,500+ of bills when all I wanted was to get an IUD.<//review>

<time>1380857807527<//time><Text>I have been seeing Dr Bickman for about 8 years now. Dr Bickman has been through 2 full term pregnancies both of which I was higher risk because of my age ( 38 and 42). She delivered to me a healthy baby boy 4 years ago and a healthy baby girl last year. Both pregnacies were perfect, just a little morning sickness. I believe that she played a roll in that. She always made herself available to me and gave me peace of mind when I saw her. When it was time to deliver and she walked in the room I felt relief and confidence that she would get us through this with ease... and she did!!!

The office staff is helpful and considerate. When Dr Bickman has a delivery or emergency they let the waiting room know there will be a delay.They are very organized and always greet me by name with a smile.

I recomend Dr Bickman because she is amazing and has the ability to make you feel comfortable. She is caring and nurturing in EVERY situation

She Is truly incredible!!!!</Text><name>Michele Canchola Meza< /name>< Rating>

Dr. Bickman is by far the best OBGYN I have ever had. I moved to LA three years ago and was referred to Dr. Bickman from my primary care physician. I needed a Dr. in the UCLA health system that was located close enough to my office in Santa Monica so that I could have appointments before/during work. Three years and two children later I would highly recommend Dr. Bickman to ANYONE.

I never had to wait longer than 30 minutes for an appointment. If I ever suspected that she was running behind schedule (due to a delivery or patient emergency) I would just call the office and ask so they could give me an idea of what time to come in. She is flexible and has even allowed me to make last minute appointments as well.

I love her bedside manner. I like to ask a lot of questions and am curious about EVERYTHING. Dr. Bickman has always taken time to talk to me about my concerns and share her knowledge. She is obviously very busy and wants to make sure everyone gets the same level of attention. You can tell by the way she runs around her office going from room to room, patient to patient that she doesn't like to keep people waiting, yet I never felt rushed or neglected.

Both of my pregnancies were high risk and Dr. Bickman handled each with diligent care and concern. I had to be hospitalized for two months during my first pregnancy and she visited me (along with any other patients she had on bedrest) EVERY DAY in the hospital, even on her days off. For both of my pregnancies she referred me to a perinatologist to help manage my pregnancy. I was impressed that she continued to lead my case and work closely with him to manage any procedures or make any decisions regarding my health and the health of the baby. She was involved every step of the way and delivered both of my children! Its clear she invests in her patients and takes time to understand her patients history and condition. She doesn't make you feel bad or uncomfortable about anything and can relate to almost EVERYTHING we go through because she is a woman with children herself.< /text>

If you don't mind getting marketed for botox and laser hair removal while trying to take care of your gynecological health, then Dr. Tristan Emily Bickman is the gal for you!< /Text>

I agree with the other reviews that the wait time is absolutely insane but the reason i am writing this review is because i was refused birth control. I had my IUD removed by Dr Bickman (it had been 5 years and was time) they told me they had to order another one, which would take 2 weeks. It has now been TWO months i have called at least 10 times. Two different times they told me that they forgot to order it, or rather the pharmacy didn’t have a record of them ordering it. Every. single. time. i called they said they would call me back that day and they NEVER called me. This whole situation has been awful. I had to go to the Planned Parenthood to get a new IUD.<//review>

I can not express my gratitude towards Matt and Sandro for all of their hard work. The first time I came here was two years ago when I was in need of a good reliable car as I was driving back and forth from home and college. I gave them a price range of what I could’ve afford back then, and they met my expectations. Fast forward to now, two months ago they helped my parents get a car and I recently decided to trade-in the first car I got there for a newer one, and to say that I am beyond happy with my purchase, is an understatement. My experience here has been so smooth and stress free. They will go beyond and above to work with you. If I could give them more than five stars...I would! Once again, thank you so much guys for being the best and being so patient(:<//Text>

I have to admit, I was nervous at first to go into financing a car and getting a vehicle all alone, as a woman I don’t know much about cars. But they truly helped me through every issue I was having. It was easy, fast, and is so reliable to go with this dealership. They were recommended to me by a friend and now I have recommended them to a lot of my friends! I’m in love with my car❤️ It’s perfect for me and I’m gonna continue a friendship with this dealership cause they’re honest and have some amazing people working there! Sandro, Matt and Nacho helped me out with a lot! Thanks again guys, me and my baby boy love it 🍾</review>

<review>Professional, friendly, courteous and a no hassle purchase  process, that is what you will get from the staff at Auto Source Unlimited in Nipomo. From the moment we stepped onto the lot and were greeted by Sandro all the way through financing with Matt and then signing the paperwork not once was there a doubt that we made the right decision. Over the past 20 years and 10 auto purchases this was by far the easiest and most pain and stress free with no pressure purchase processes I have been through. They went above and beyond and got me a much better rate than I thought I was going to get so if you are looking for that next vehicle purchase do yourself a favor and save some time and stress and give they guys at Auto Source Unlimited a chance to e a run your business. I can tell you this, you will not regret it. Hats off to you Sandro and Matt....Thank you and I am sure that in the future I will be seeing you both again for any and all of my future purchases and will make sure and spread  the good word that Auto Source Unlimited is the Central Coasts no hassles, one stop shop for any and all my families Auto buying needs. Thanks again to both of you.< /review>< pics>

EXCELLENT service!! Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a car! Me and my fiancé bought our Nissan Altima from them and absolutely love it. They work with you, instead of you doing all the work for them. Very helpful and respectful team. 5 out of 5!!</review>

<Review>Small, family operation, with no pushy sales people to contend with. My experience is, you look around, if you see a vehicle you like, you check it out, take it for a test drive, and make a deal. No b.s.
Seems to me how buying a car should be.
I will not hesitate to buy another from here, any time I find another one I want, or am in need. In fact, I will check here first.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This place is all that you would expect from a small lot. Nothing fancy, jut good hassle free service will a smile. We got a good deal here an a 2016 Kia sedona. The owner was very helpful and I didn't get the slimy car salesman vibe from him. 👍🏼< /Text>

I had an AMAZING experience buying my first car at Auto Source Unlimited!  After graduating college and starting my career I contacted ASU to purchase my first vehicle. The dealership had an assortment of high quality inventory to choose from. I was set on a specific car that I wanted and Matthew (owner) gladly worked with me to make it happen. The process was quick, simple, and stress free. I love my car and highly recommend this dealership to my family, friends, and anyone looking to purchase a vehicle! THANK YOU AUTO SOURCE!!</review>

<Review>I bought a car from Matt not to long ago. And hands down the best experience I've had at any dealership. I was greeted at the door and showed to the cars with no pressure from the dealership. I got a great deal on the car and easily financed. You might circle the parking lot looking for the dealership, but once inside you have great quality cars to choose from. I'm defenetly recommending Auto Source Unlimited to my family and friends.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Time>1396746255809</Time><Review>I am a young buyer that was looking around for a reliable college car and out of all of the dealerships I looked at I felt most comfortable at Auto Source Unlimited. They were very personal and made me feel little to no pressure at all when deciding. They sell a limited quantity of cars at a time, but that made it much easier to pick out a car in my price range. They made me feel very comfortable and I completely recommend them for any person looking for a reliable car in a reasonable price range.< /Review><user>109281158609840372213</user>< name>

I definitely recommend checking out Auto source unlimited! Matt was so great and helpful..I had been to a few other car dealerships prior..and Matt by far was the best! He wasn't pushy at all and made sure I got everything I needed..he let me take the car I was interested in for the day so I could really feel out the car before deciding to purchase it..and I loved it! The experience was everything I had hoped it would be! Thanks again so much Matt!<//text>

<text>Excellent Car Dealer, My transaction was flawless and extremely fast. The Dodge Caliber I purchased is in great condition and was a great price. Matt worked to get the lowest interest rate possible and his great service and attention made this the best vehicle transaction I have ever been a part of. I will look here first for my next car purchase.<//text><rating>5< /rating><Name>Robert Joslin</Name><Pics>None< /Pics><time>1434997871251</time>< resp>

I had the best experience here ! After my car crash I was nervous of all the different dealers I had talked to and Matt the owner and his family were nothing but amazing and the way they treated me made the entire sale that much easier. I now have a car that i love and the price was very affordable. Will be buying my cars from them from this day on ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND<//text>

I'm  a first time buyer and Matt made it very easy for me . I told him what I was looking for, he was very knowledgeable and had a lot of insights on the vehicles he had and the financial services he had to offer. It was a very comfortable atmosphere with no pressure in committing to buying. Was also glad that he had the car fax without any hesitation.< /Review>

This place really helped me out on getting the car I wanted, he can really get you the car you want, any color, model, year, any car. Matt is a very good guy, very friendly and helpful, he's a good friend. So if in need of a car come here, I really recommend it.</review>

Even though I wasn't able to buy at the time, I was treated well. Far better than I expected. Thank you,
UPDATE 9/20/16 - Since  my visit  (7/17/16), I have tried to contact Auto Source three times - - twice by phone  (both calls went to voicemail) and once by text. Nobody has responded.< /Text>

This little dealership in Nipomo should not be overlooked if you are in the market for a used car! There are many things I liked about it. One, the inventory is not overwhelming. Sometimes if there are hundreds of cars, it's just too much. Also, cars are very clean and in good shape. There's a nice variety from SUV's to sedans to more sporty options. However, what impressed me most was the owner/manager Matt. He was so helpful and so friendly, but never pushy. And he was happy to pull up the car faxes for the cars we were interested in. Car shopping, which can often be quite stressful, was a pleasant experience here!< /Text>

This may be an odd review considering the final purchase wasn't with Auto Source, but I don't want to pass up the opportunity to praise a recent experience there with Matthew. A family member was looking to buy a car and based on a listing she saw for one she was interested in, we drove up to Nipomo to check it out. As others here have mentioned, it's a tiny showroom that you wouldn't easily notice from the road, but they had several nice vehicles of different categories and at varying price points. Also as mentioned, there was no pressure. Dealing with Matthew was so pleasant. He stayed far past closing to help us, kindly offered a lot of other information and guidance not tied to "making a sale" that I believe will be invaluable in the long run, and was generous with his time and communication over the couple of days that he worked with us. He was completely amenable to our taking the car to a mechanic of our choosing for a pre-purchase inspection (something I'd strongly recommend to anyone no matter who you're buying from and especially if buying from a business where they're not specializing in one type of car and don't have their own service department). As we didn't live nearby, Matthew had the car transported to the mechanic we chose so that I wouldn't have to leave work early in order to get it there. It turned out there was an issue with the vehicle that had been missed (can happen and we later discovered from someone else why it may have gotten missed, but I appreciated the transparency we encountered). Rather than trying to "make it work" with that car, the final purchase ended up being another vehicle found elsewhere, but I wish things had worked out so that the sale could have been given to Matthew at Auto Source. When my husband and I are in need of another vehicle, I'd happily start looking there.< /Review>

<text>I would definitely recommend going to Auto Source Unlimited when looking for a car, my family is growing and we needed a SUV. I drove up to Auto Source Unlimited in Nipomo from Ventura, Matt was kind enough to be their earlier than when they opened and let us test drive the car. Matt answered all our questions and we were very comfortable with our decision on buying a Dodge Journey. My wife and kids love the car it is very spacey and comfortable, Matt gave us a good deal and wasn't pushey at all like at other places I looked at cars before I made my purchase at Auto Source Unlimited. Overall great customer service and great prices on all their cars, please see them if interested in a car and ask for Matt.

Thanks again Matt</text>< userid>

Found this place on the way to the beach and we were both surprised finding such a great spot. The food was really good and though the service started off slow, by the end of the meal it was all good. I highly recommend finding this place. Get the omlette.</text>

<text>Unfriendly host but good food. Make a reservation for dinner (starts at 5pm). Servers were at least nice. That older host guy needs to retire. He acted like he didnt care if we ate there or not since we didnt have a reservation, even though it was 45 minutes until dinner began and we just wanted food from the bar menu.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808e5564f785b16b:0x6778d74ee78c4781<//gmap_id></record>

Delicious place with kind staff. We came here the night before Valentines for dinner, and had breakfast the next day. The potatoes fries and breakfast potatoes were delicious! The vegetables we're prepared so well with lots of flavor. The rib eye was perfectly done and tasty. Can't wait to come back here again.< /text>

This is an interesting place, it's setup like a fancy / high end restaurant and charges the prices you would expect for one but is also accepting of the people who are camping in the RV or Tent sites. It's nice that it's open like that.

They start you off with a nice bagett / sourdough loaf and garlic butter  I had Cesar salad and Cioppino and my wife the clam chowder, corn risotto and crab cakes.

The salad was good but in one of those strange fancy / not moments I wasn't offered ground pepper with it - I made due with the pepper on the table. The Cioppino had a flavorful but watery broth with a fair helping of seafood but it was all a bit overcooked (tough shrimp, fish that would have been dry if not in broth). I wasn't dissapointed, it wasn't bad, it was just average.

My wife reported the chowder was also on the thin side but had good flavor and she really enjoyed the crab cakes and risotto.

The restaurant has a full bad and I found the local speciality generous in size and surprisingly inexpensive as far as mixed drinks go.

I've been here before and have never had a bad meal (they have mad good cobblers in the past) and if you are already here it's a nice place to eat. I don't think I would make it a destination. Though, ~25 miles up the coast are quite a few other options, probably the same south of here.<//Review>

< Review>
I took my boyfriend here for Valentines Day a two years ago. The setting was nice, and I recall the food being decent. What was not so great was the service: ignored by the hostess, we weren't informed that they had run out of more than one dish that night until attempting to order those dishes, service was exceptionally slow (restaurant was not full), our waiters were switched at least once due to restaurant confusion/staffing issues. I spoke up and made requests, but no comped dessert/drink/ acknowledgement of what was going on there was made. If a restaurant can't handle X Number of guests, they absolutely shouldn't accept them, especially on Valentine's Day.<//Review>

<user_id>101012900018431970355<//user_id><Text>I stopped for dinner on my birthday last year on August 20th,2016, I had a fractured hand and arm. My whole arm was in a brake making it difficult for me to sit at the bar. The hostess a male was so rude , he asked me if I was going to have dinner, I said yes I was. He pointed to the bar, told me to sit at the bar since I was lone. I asked to speak to the manager and pointed to my injury, he asked me to wait, after 1/2 hour he showed me to a single table telling me to be done with dinner in half 1/2 as they had other reservations. I sat there for 2 1/2 hours, had champagne, appetizer, dinner and desert. Although the steak was cooked to my standard the serve was really bad. (They had no idea that I am a professional chief). I am thinking of going back there again this week to see if there are any changes to providing good service. (Still trying to decide).</Text>< time>

< review>
We're from Dallas, TX. We usually dine in at Houston's steakhouse or 3 Forks, even sometimes 4 seasons. So we carry around a standard for other restaurants. This one I have to say, for a campground restaurant. They did excellent in choice of the sauce that they braise their steak ( rib eye) and the house salad was under estimated. My wife enjoys and expects alot from any crab cakes and she was extremely happy with her plate along with her house salad. To finish the dinner we had the creme brulee but it did not meet what a creme brulee should be. Btw the calamari as an appetizer was great.< /review>

my opinion, its gone down hill in the past couple years, not worth the money any more. the food is still fresh, just doesn't have the same quality of cooking, seems the menu has moved in a more common direction, nothing special anymore. the bar is nice and bartenders are friendly.
Nothing to brag about like I used to.< /review>

Amazing service and the manager AJ goes over the top to provide the proper selection of wine to pair with a consistently changing menu using local ingredients!</text>

<review>They are awesome . Its the best Authentic Mexican Food restaurant in King City. They built a nice patio on the side of the restaurant with 3 big stand up heaters in it . Because of the pandemic. It would even be awesome if they left it up after the pandemic is over. ... with some mariachis<//review>< Pics>

Stopped for some dinner on my way down the 101. Delicious tacos (Asada, pastor, shrimp) and the new “Drink Special” was worth the $10. Definitely coming back to this spot.< /Review>

This is a family favorite when we eat out. The food is authentic, fresh and tastey. We usually get the tacos and enchiladas and always an extra side of guacamole! They have a sub specialty in seafood so be sure to try the shrimp tacos if you like seafood.<//review>

Very nice.  A lot of food given on the plate.  Not the usually american style of mexican food.  Also, nice colorful art work on the walls.< /review>

Okay mole chicken. Okay seafood plate. They are generous with sauce. However, the place looks a bit shabby; There was a big open stinking garbage can next to where customers pay and I saw a pile of shrimp lying around at room temperature in the kitchen. Still, their prices are as high as one finds in nicer restaurants.<//text>

Saddest excuse for a burrito... The burrito came in a grocery store bought cheap tortilla and wasn't even fully wrapped. Cheap ingredients poor service, I wouldn't recommend going here.</Review>

There are many excellent Mexican restaurants in King City,. In-fact, the city might have some of the best Mexican food in the state. El Sinaloense may be the best in King City, based on salsa, beans and rice alone. This is a sit-down, but pay at the front, kind of place, but you can order up-front too. Make sure to try their beans.</text>

<Review>Absolutely amazing and authentic food. Their mole and pescado soup can't be explained in words. Just great. Plus their Micheladas are ridiculous in a good way.<//Review>< pics>

I miss authentic Mexican food.  It has been years (like 20) since I've had anything close to authentic until I went here.  Very impressed!!< /text>

I had the carne azada Plate and it was good. It was a little pricey but worth it. I ended up paying  30.00 us dollars.< /Review>

The food here was great (and the portions generous enough that I didn't need dinner after esting lunch here).  A hidden gem in King City i plan to visit whenever I drive through that area.<//review>

<Review>Really disappointed.  Lots of school children served with lunch?  Cook and waitresses join you to eat something better than served? A whole family affair!  What's not to like without the whole family and friends to share your meal?  What, you don't like eating, and paying for a $20 mediocre meal with lots of kids to entertain you at meal time? It's a playground!  Combination beef taco and chicken enchilada meal was mediocre at best.  The enchilada was small and the taco was cold and dry, just cold meat. The cooks and friends eat better?  I apologize to the European couple that were eating there among st the childcare thing and poor quality food.  I would not recommend this place. And the whole glaring thing if you didn't like the kids rampaging about was unnerving.

Oh. Hey. I live here. Down the road, about 1/2 mile.</Review>< time>

Breakfast on Sunday, coming over the hill from Coalinga to get to the 101. We love finding good locally-owned restaurants, trying new foods and were intrigued by this place. We were not disappointed. It was busy but not crowded with the building worn but clean. The staff was quick and courteous. I ordered the Sinaloan breakfast (spicy egg scramble with peppers, beans, and a rice medley). It was delicious with a slightly vinegary spicy flavor to the eggs, but the beans were to die for. The we're white beans and partly mashed similar to refried but not. My wife chose the chorizo and egg breakfast and she too loved the meal (although she said the chorizo was a little too oily, I noticed she ate it all). All ingredients we're fresh and we'll seasoned altho the rice medley may have used some prepared corn and carrots. Oh, and the chips came with one of the best table salsas I've ever had. The price was fair, but not cheap. I will probably never be traveling thru there again, but if I do this is a must-stop.<//Review>

<Text>One of my favorite places to eat in KC. Their menu can be a little on the expensive side compared to other places but their food is delicious. my faves include the carne asada plate, Chile Colorado (burrito or plate), Chile verde, bistec ranchero, and shrimp tacos. Their rice is so very savory and tasty. Great place to go!< /Text>< rating>

(Translated by Google) They are worth pure 🍆! Super ordinary and rude waitresses! They did not take care of me and they gave me an attitude and they even ignored me! If you don't see yourself as a paisa, they won't take care of you! It seems that it is a money laundering for you know who.

(Original)
Valen pura 🍆! Las meseras super corrientes y maleducadas! No me atendieron y me dieron una actitud y asta me ignoraron! Si no te vez como paisa  no te atienden! Parece q es un lavadero de dinero para saben quien.<//Review>

<Time>1577487176791</Time><Review>(Translated by Google) Having tables available and plenty of staff, they told us they were very full and didn't have time to do so. I think customers are not treated that way. The treatment we receive, as tourists, is unfortunate.

Teniendo mesas disponibles y sobrado personal, nos dijeron que estaban muy llenos y no tenían tiempo de hacerlo. Creo que a los clientes no se les trata de esa manera. Es lamentable el trato que recibimos, como turistas.</Review>< Name>

I smoke hookahs only in Shangri - La Hookah Lounge, no one makes hookahs better than in city.
I really liked that they have a lot of board games that you can play with a large company.
Special thanks to the hookah master Alex, who is polite and always watches over the hookah.
There is also very pleasant music in the hookah bar.
I advice everyone to visit them at least once and try the most delicious hookah.<//Text>

<text>One of the best hookah spots in San Diego. Arthur, one of the workers, was extremely courteous and made sure our hookah always hit the way we wanted it too. Great experience and I would definitely be coming back. They have WiFi here but it is not that great. Still a great spot to chill  and get work done because they have tables and a lot of outlets. Would recommend checking this place out</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPMwX-YDxri2D6TFaI5aRm0RP5fD5IrmClBdAZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmnlx1fI1UedHACKlJV1H_OdjzwNYazuQcKQAv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ30PWt6PVA_QojWiPSF0z_kaFhltTr47aATQC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Great place. Very chill vibe. Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable . Good variety of hookah, the taste our server suggested was just perfect, very refreshing. We decided to try German style hookah and were very impressed- super smooth. We ended up staying there for 2,5 hours. I would definitely recommend to check it out !!!!</Review>< Rating>

Great music and chill vibe. Get the citrus or pineapple add-on well worth the price. They have specials for everyday. On Mondays they have a 20% off special. They also offer games like Monopoly, Uno, chess, and Jenga.<//text>

Very great hookah lounge! One of the only ones I will frequent, the female hostess is so sweet and very kind! I love seeing her when I go, she’s very accommodating and pays great attention to detail with the orders.

I’ve loved what they’ve done with their interior decorations. It gave off a Harry Potter vibe for me and my best friend, but it’s a great lounge all around! I love it. Best bowl flavor for me is the English Breakfast!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Most of the employees here know how to pack a perfect bowl of hookah. Something MANY hookah joints do not know how to do correctly. They DO NOT  use quick-lite coals either. Your hookah will keep consistent taste without a burnt flavor.

Prices are great, especially during Happy Hour. Large selection of flavors. A box of board games. Couches and tables. They offer a few snacks and drinks. Many restaurants outside along the street.

Only place I hookah now.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc01eb4e3b56fb:0xb86590747c2e46d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice place, but it's missing something. Needs more lively music and needs to serve some form of alcohol. Other than that, very chill place...< /text>

Best hookah I have ever had out side of my home. The dude has this iCloud coal holder that keeps the tobacco hot but never burns. Will return!!</Text>

Made sure we were good the whole time. Suggest the German hookah, much better smoke and smoother. Great place, suggest you give it a try if you're looking for a better option of hookah lounges.<//Text>< Pictures>

Try Lavoo hookah! This is the smoothest one and the best one I’ve ever tried. It comes with a fruit bowl so it lasts for about 2 hours. It depends if you smoke it the right way. I adore this place. It has the real ice tip- not like anywhere else. Everything looks great and high quality. I finally found a good spot for smoking hookah.</text>

<review>It was my best experience ever! Hookah is really smooth and lasts for more than an hour. I came on Wednesday and got a free fruit bowl upgrade and they have other deals for every weekday. Really great prices for such a high quality stuff! I highly recommend this place!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

My best experience with Hookah happened here in Shangri-La yesterday. I was surprised how smooth the hookah was and how long it lasted. About 2 hours still great taste. Stuff is really accommodating and the prices are really cool for such a great hookah. I’m the regular from now. And the bonus for regulars- every 13th hookah is free!!!!!!!</review>

<Review>This place has changed ownership again. It use to be hookah labs.  Staff has changed also.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the flavors that they carry.  No where else will you find earl grey flavor that actually tastes like it.  It's like smoking tea!</Review>< Time>

So far the best hookah lounge in San Diego. They have 3 or 4 different types of hookahs to choose from (Egyptian, German and glass...) Amazing Arabic/modern decor. The fact they use kaloud lotus instead of regular foil gets them above and beyond! Hookah tender've done a good job with our hookah. They have literally any tobacco flavor you can imaging so it's even hard to pick one) his recommendations helped a lot. Thank you Shangri-La Hookah Lounge, we'll be back!</review>

This place has sone of the best prices on engine parts for 22RE and 22RTE engines around. Definitely lower than LCEngineering. I've never purchased one of their long blocks but I haven't heard anything negative from people who have purchased their engines or complete heads. Shipping was very fairly priced and I will definitely purchase more parts from Yota1 Performance in the future!</review>

The staff and owner here are the BEST! So knowledgeable. Made me feel comfortable about my engine purchase and parts. I can't recommend enough. I hope I never need another engine, but I won't go anywhere else now for a replacement. Definitely worth the 4 1/2 hour drive! Thanks Yota 1. You folks deserve a good review!</review>

This place is awesome. I ordered a rebuilt 22re for my crawler. Nick Was highly knowledgeable and listened to what I wanted on my engine and made recommendations based on my driving. And for the women in the front desk, they were awesome. Highly recommend this place. Mahalo for the best service and product. Yota1 definitely got fans here on Maui. ALOHA🤙🏻🤙🏻< /Review>

<Name>Johnny Canedo<//Name><text>Yota 1 is without a doubt, one of the most professional shops I have had they pleasure of doing business with! They're true professionals and very knowledgeable when it comes to Toyota's.  They made me feel very comfortable while my truck was at their shop and always kept me informed so there were no "surprise" repairs or cost. If I ever had any further problems with my Toyota pickup, I would not hesitate to go to them for repairs! I will continue to refer them as they are 100% reliable and trustworthy!

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I have not been in their shop but I just ordered a rebuilt 22re from them. Nick was extremely helpful and friendly helping me determine where the upgrades were worth the $ for my particular use. I called a few shops and Nick was by far the most helpful and knowledgeable person I spoke with. My only complaint is that they are in California and not closer to me in Arizona! This seems like a top quality facility run by people who care.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>I came here on 11-8-17 to get my flywheel resurfaced. I waited for the shop to open up so I can give them the flywheel. I could've went to other shops close by that opened earlier but I went to this one because of the good feedback I heard and it's all true.
They do great work and I was able to leave happily.

Will definitely come again.< /text><user_name>Seng Yang< /user_name><userid>100766524860663769434< /userid><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response></record>

I brought my Lexus flywheel to resurfaced and he did work. Once we put the flywheel back on our car it was still shaking. It turns out the flywheel was already bad and he still did the work instead of being honest and charging us so much money. Next time go Yosemite Machine good honest people their with better prices.< /Review>

We travel from Napa to this amazeing place just outside of Modesto, the labor price is fair, fast reasonable diagnostic and amazeing warranties, we take the Company Rock Crawler here for all the repairs because this shop is well worth the drive.

I have never been to the shop itself however I have had an absolutely astounding expierence through the website and email. First of all they sell real genuine quality parts at unbelievibly low prices. On top of that the employees and owners of the company, have given me nothing but excellent customer service with any problems or questions I have had. I couldn’t recommend a better company to go through for Toyota parts and in terms of Toyota I have looked everywhere for my parts. I highly recommend them to you and even my mom (;<//text>

<text>The owner Nick intentionally told me to order the wrong size bearings when I called the question about it he said he was irritated and to come get it measured again
I've also purchased a $3,000 performance motor that went out in less than 10000 miles.
Pick-n-Pull has better quality and services than what you should recive at yota 1.</text>< Pictures>

I urge anyone to take a trip to Sunland Produce Market. The prices on Vegetables and fruits are unbeatable. The ethnic food of every part of the world is in the aisles. The meat section is plenty and they have just about any type of cut and meat in stock.

Pictured are Pasilla peppers that will be made into Chili Rellenos.

Every part of the world seems to be represented there.

The carts are cleaned by a crew member as they are going in.  The store is clean and the line moves fast.

About the only negative I can say is that it gets full.  Parking is never a problem because of the large parking lot.

I highly recommend Sunland Produce Market for any of your fruit and vegetable needs.< /Text>

I love getting all my middle eastern fix. The spice collection is awsome. I prefer the fruits and veggies from them over ralphs or vons for the fraction of the cost. Love my sweet fruits. Great selection of dried fruits and nuts. Deli and cheeses is on point. Very fresh. Can't comment on poultry, beef and fish yet< /review>

< review>
This for a long time has been one of my favorite markets. Not only can one find a ton of specialties from different countries around the world but the selection of produce and vegetables is truly second to none. I also love the deli and the cheeses. I don’t want to let you know that they’re also one of the least expensive markets. Basically it’s worth the drive every time, one of LA’s best supermarkets.</review>

Great store. Good deals. And produce looked good also. They only sell loose collard greens though, nothing packaged. Staff is friendly also.< /text>

Good values on produce.  Lots are from Mexico.  Nice ethnic food choices including a meat and deli counter and a great variety of middle eastern cheeses and breads  Social distancing is not easy.  Many of the patrons seem to be unaware.<//Review>

Fresh veggies and fruits, foreign varieties and interesting greens. Best deli counter!!! So many varieties to choose from, make your own meat and cheese platter. Oils, honey, teas and bread, the choices are vast. One of my all time favorite stores.< /review>

If you are anywhere close to this place its worth the trip. They have wide variety fruitsand vegetables, dried, fresh or canned. As well as dairy products, liquor, and meats. Fully stocked with ethnic products hard to find in most grocery stores.<//text>

Happy to find a large variety of ethnic foods that aren’t usually available in mainstream stores. Nevertheless, do check the dates on packaged items before you buy as they’re sometimes past their expiration date. In some cases the dates aren’t even marked on the jar/can.
Even if they agree to do an exchange, (as what happened to me when I discovered the gnocchi I bought was 4 months past its sell-by date) it’s not only inconvenient but at a time like this, risky. Especially when no one needs to go out more than they have to.< /review>

I went there today. It was packed like a busy airport at the peak time. There was no one at the doors limiting the number of the people coming in. No social distancing, no measures to prevent the spread of potential hazard. I went to the service desk and asked to do something. I was told they will start limiting the number of the people coming in. Yet, nothing was done. When I exited the store there was no change. Something needs to be done.< /Text>

<review>This store is without competition, best selection of vegetables and fruit, best prices, no other store can compare. Weekends are insanely busy, you might be circling the parking lot for 5 minutes or more looking for a spot. Best time to shop here is anytime any day other then weekends. Another hidden gem of L.A.</review></record>

This is a grocery store unlike any other, being both a good and bad thing. The bright side is that the variety of exotic spices and plants is far greater here than any other produce store in the area, which comes with vegetables that not even I have heard of. The main cost is that the produce is a bit pricey and the atmosphere bland.</review>

They have lot of stuff and lots of parking. Some produce is super cheap, others, not so much. Good sales. If you need Middle Eastern spices or ingredients, great. European smoked meat products, check! Cheeses, check! Fresh bread! Down sides, select your produce carefully. It's not all first quality, so bruises and the like (tend to go bad more quickly). Lines are pretty bad with no space for them to go anywhere. That being said, you can get a week's worth of produce for a large family for under $20.< /Text>

<text>Interesting and very informative of different cultures of food here in Sunland Produces. Been going her for years, always new produces, drinks like coconut milk with fruit inside to drink for a good price. As my neighbor told me about Parriot Coconut Milk really good drink, vegetables and flat bread you can get.< /text>< Pics>

<text>This is a store with lots of products that you do not find in regular markets. European chocolates, vine, liquor, cheeses and a variety of nuts and fruits.. but .. parking is always full, products do not last even in the fridge, so is hit and miss. Now they even  cancel the deli, and good luck finding the cheese and cold cuts you look for. Ones again.. hit and miss.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I find delicacies and other great products with ease. I find things made in Italy, France, Bulgaria, Russia,Greece and so many other places of Europe and Asia. I appreciate that.  Also, their meat and  fruit selection are excellent and their prices are very reasonable. And the people greet me with a smile whilst providing nearly excellent service. I highly recommend it. Vasya.<//Review>

Whatever, I have found great bargains there, with reasonable prices for imported jellies, jams, and various other imported products you do not see in the normal supermarkets. They have a lot of imported goods from the middle east, a few from Europe and Asia, and even Africa (I think). the dairy and produce products are very fresh, and it is the only place I have found where they sell Braunschweiger. There is what looks like a varied meat and fish counter and it must be good because there is always a line (take a number) waiting to be served.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This is my favorite place for vegetable and fruits. The most important factor is Price. Fresh and Cheap in comparison to other stores. They have huge parking space so no issue with parking. Good place to get fresh chicken. Only issue is during weekend it's too crowdy because of compact space.</Review>

Good place for produce like fruits and vegetables. They have great deals on nuts and dry fruit....

Stay away from the meat department. ...I've never had a good experience.

The deli....try anything you are going to buy to a sure the freshness :)<//review>

I'm being a bit generous because Produce is in the name.  And they do have inexpensive passable produce. But of the 5 items I put in my cart today that had use by or sell by dates 4 were expired.  Between 1 and 6 days past the sell by date.  I sent them back at the cashierbit still,
Check your expiration dates CAREFULLY because the store isn't.< /Review>

The price for produce is wonderful here. Super cheap, decent quality produce. The cons are that the place is constantly packed and the aisles are tiny so there are always inconsiderate people slowly strolling through the middle of every single aisle in the entire store.</Review>

<review>Great fresh produce. Good bakery with fresh bagels. The ONLY place in the nob hill/ Pac heights area that carries edible clay. Really friendly staff except for the woman who checked me out and acted like it was an inconvenience to get me a book of stamps. I actually apologized and she was like "mmhm..." But overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Especially the guys in the bakery department. Good selection of food and FRUITS!< /review>< Gmap_id>

Great fresh produce. Good bakery with fresh bagels. The ONLY place in the nob hill/ Pac heights area that carries edible clay. Really friendly staff except for the woman who checked me out and acted like it was an inconvenience to get me a book of stamps. I actually apologized and she was like "mmhm..." But overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Especially the guys in the bakery department. Good selection of food and FRUITS!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Great prices.  Today bananas 49 cents lb. &  persimmons 99 cents a pound. Lots of turn-over means produce is fresh (So when you hit a bad day you're surprised) and there are lots of options. Good nut selection.  Shoppers are friendly & help make selections when products are unfamiliar (soujoukh) and offer cooking advice. The staff is wonderful.  Many have been there for years.  I love this place.</text>< Pictures>

The cons are that the place is constantly packed and the aisles are tiny so there are always inconsiderate people slowly strolling through the middle of every single aisle in the entire store.</text>< pictures>

<Text>A good ethnic oriented grocery store with a huge produce department and service deli.
Predominately Middle East food with many otherwise obscure (in American supermarket) Hispanic items.
An entire isle of cookies and crackers, without a single Nabisco or Keebler item in sight. European, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and East European sweet treats that are not seen elsewhere.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I'm being a bit generous because Produce is in the name.  And they do have inexpensive passable produce. But of the 5 items I put in my cart today that had use by or sell by dates 4 were expired.  Between 1 and 6 days past the sell by date.  I sent them back at the cashierbit still,
Check your expiration dates CAREFULLY because the store isn't.</Text>

Considering they closed down Ralph's this is really the only real market within 5 miles. Their meats and produce aren't the best quality but the price is right.<//review>

< Review>
We went there to get an idea of of what we were going to spend for an event.  We were writing down prices to keep track of the cost and they told us to stop.  I understand that but it did prevent us from asking about other possible options for our event.  On the other hand, thier prices on produce are very low and thier quality is pretty high.  Just could have done without the guilt trip about wanting to keep track of costs.  We will be buying our produce here but probably not much else.</Review>

<Review>As a vegetarian, I cannot say enough about the diversity of produce at Sunland Produce. They are priced similar to other "wholesale" grocery stores and the quiality of produce is about the same. That is to say, its good, but you have to check it out yourself just in case :-)

My only complaint is that they don't have a peanut butter that has no sugar, and although that would usually give a store a 1 star review, they are still worth 5 stars.</Review>< Name>

This is my go to grocery store for produce. The prices cannot be beat. The quality and selection of produce is outstanding. The only reason this gets 4 stars is because it fails as a one stop shop grocery store. You won't find many of the things common in mainstream market. However this is a good thing in my opinion.< /Review>

It's clean, their prices are reasonable and seem to carry freshest produce than other markets.and their choice of spices are great.I wish they would carry Organic  potatoes, fruit and veggies like Spinach, Kale, etc. But Overall I really like Sunland produce for my provisions..</text>

<UserId.>117565618531099317193</UserId.><response>None<//response><Review>When I first started shopping at Sunland Produce about 10 years ago I was very impressed with the quality & price of their fresh produce. Most recently within the past two years or so the quality has declined considerably. I continue to patronize because of the convenience, If it's not to my liking I just won't buy it.  They do have a great selection of nuts, and an array of international foods. I stay clear of the butcher counter but do purchase items from the deli from time to time. The cashiers are always pleasant but the owner has about as much personalty as a piranha.

<review>I mainly shop for vegetables, fruits and bread and most of the time it's fresh, it's best to shop early during the day otherwise they run out of some items. I was disappointed purchasing olive oil and meat there, so I don't anymore.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Big, clean space, not particularly aesthetically pleasing. That is not the point. For the most part, its main draw is the bargains you can find here, e.g. 5 lbs of dates for $10, Bulgarian feta cheese for $2.98, big Panettone cake for $5, etc.

Vast area reserved for vegetables & fruits much of it discounted. (Don't buy too much since they may spoil earlier because they may be older hence the possible discount). Huge spice & herb selection. Dried fruits, nuts, seeds. Large display of  cheese, meat & processed meats such as sausages, Bologna not necessarily made in Italy but somewhere in Eastern Europe.

Much of the processed foods veer between Latin American & Armenian. But with Armenians spread out over Iran, Lebanon, Syria as well as having been part of the former USSR, there is good representation of Middle Eastern & Eastern European.

Nice presentation of food from far corners of the world. Good way to stretch your dollar if you know the prevailing undiscounted price of the food items you are buying in order to comparison shop.<//review>

They have every produce feom across the continent. Prices are very affordable and clean. The only annoying thing is the space,  it's hard to roam with the cart and not hit anyone.</Review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>A mid-sized Supermarket with an unrivaled selection of fruits & vegetables but, also with 'not-so-super' service.

Located near the Gateway to Shadow Hills, at the intersection of Sunland and Glenoaks Blvds. this single location operation has offered the East valley an outstanding selection of fresh produce since 1990. Following the closure of Ralphs last year it is now the ONLY grocery store within a three mile radius, a situation which has certainly increased sales volume...unfortunately at the expense of prompt service. I would recommend avoiding weekend visits, unless you enjoy full parking lots and long lines!

The store offers a full  Meat Counter with reasonably priced weekly specials, for example: ground beef @ $1.79 lb or T-bone steak @ $4.99 lb. The service at this counter is usually prompt and the sale items are generally in stock. My only complaint is that (like most local markets) they don't seem to employ a trained butcher, instead their "meat cutters" slice everything except the roasts almost paper thin.

A "full service" deli counter offers a good variety of meats and cheeses, but delivers them in an almost comically lackadaisical manner. For example; while holding a "take-a-number" which had at least nine people ahead of me in line, I watched as three employees engaged in a 5 minute debate about who was gonna sweep the floor...which was only resolved after a fourth employee joined. THEN, all four went in different directions to search for the dust-mop, without so much as a glance toward the 11 or 12 unfortunate souls who just wanted some Swiss Cheeze!

The general merchandise is heavy with eastern European offerings as is their dairy selection. The store is not the cleanest that I've ever been in, but not filthy either. Beware, they close very early at seven (7 PM) so don't go looking for a late-night snack!

Oh yeah. One last little complaint: This is the ONLY store I have ever been two which charges an additional dollar for Marlborough 100 cigarettes (above the price for Marlborough Red kings)! So if Marl. Reds were $5.49 a pack, then Marl 100 Reds would be $6.49 per pack, the problem is that they both have the exact same amount of tobacco per cig. AND they both cost the same to buy wholesale.

Despite my tepid review, I must admit that I do shop here at least once a week - the produce selection is That Good!<//Review>< gmap_id>
