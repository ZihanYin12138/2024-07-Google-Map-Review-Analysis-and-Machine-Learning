I'm not sure but when I stopped by I looked around it was awesome. The vibe the, music the friendliness, and hospitality. Not to mention the Artist and their artwork. Got a clean Honda badge by a very very talented artist that goes by the name of Eric. Very very good shop as in professional friendly sanitary etc... Hands down favorite spot to get tatted!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFv8Puzbmxwhm6hy6uaPzExHxw-8YJMt_1qflJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKJYKUHLiVnZQPjuZtn3CVwr5hg0n9OE7YR4I9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGlCulwjlxCQklA850dwLfsozKzialp9duddxa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>My friends and I decided at 8:30 at night to do last minute septum piercings and we saw this place was doing walk ins. We had a great experience! Sarah was super sweet and talked me through every step of the way. The location is easy to find and really cool. Everyone there was super welcoming and the inside has tons of cool decor. Can't wait to go back for future piercings/tattoos!</Text>< rating>

The staff was very welcoming and friendly, made my friends and I feel very comfortable while getting our ears pierced. As soon as we walked in we were greeted, and the staff seemed well experienced which made us feel very safe. They made sure everything was sanitized and ready to use before getting started... extremely clean and friendly! definitely will be returning in the next month!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND:)</Text>

Went in a few nights ago for a couple of impulsive piercings ( I wanted two nose piercings, a friend wanted dimples ). Piercer wasn’t there, but we got told that on Sunday she’d be there, so we decided to wait it out. Sunday, she calls us, we get there and the piercer is SUPER NICE. Gave my friend some options for the dermal piercing, was super efficient, and everything was clean. She was really friendly, too - I’m so happy my first professional piercing was with her. My nose piercings look amazing, and she was happy to answer all my questions about it. My friend’s dimple piercings were awesome, too - this place is amazing for piercings. Absolutely will go back for my future piercing needs.</Text>

Omg omg omg! I will definitely be coming back here! I’m from Del Mar and drove all the way over here to get my septum pierced! Sarah was amazing made me feel so comfortable. Definitely was only going to get my septum but she rocked and made everything so smooth and comfortable! I’ve always wanted my nipples done and she made me feel so comfortable. I finally did them and it didn’t hurt because of how professional she was. I will definitely be making the drive up there again it was totally worth it! Thank you so much girl ❤️💛💚< /review>

<Review>You aren't going to find a better place to get a tattoo!  Everyone at the shop is friendly, the place is clean and inviting.  All of the artists do amazing work.  David Rivera does a phenomenal job with color and is very artistic and is able to take a customer's idea and make it into something beautiful.< /Review>< Rating>

I came here to get my first tattoo. The first time I came for just an outline of a symbol. The lines came out uneven, like a part of it was thicker than the rest. I'm not sure if it was my fault that the ink bled because I put a shirt over it right away. I wasn't given any sheet or tips on aftercare either, but I should've asked. Then a couple of months later I decided I wanted the symbol filled in and a little extra added to it. So I come back. I noticed after it healed that there are patches of my skin I can still see. I asked for it to be filled in completely. I know it's not my fault this time because my husband had a sheet he got from a different tattoo studio with the aftercare and we did everything it said. Now I'm just really bummed about my not well done first tattoo and I'm going to have to spend more money to get it done right, but definitely elsewhere. The staff seemed friendly, the shop was really cool but I just feel that they rushed doing my tattoo. :(</text>

Nick was awesome! I would highly recommend him for tattoos. Very easy to work with and designed my tattoo exactly how I wanted it. Everything is exceptionally clean and the shop has a very friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be getting more work done by Nick.<//Review>

<text>Super awesome employees, fast piercings and good work :)
But they do not accept cards (cash only) I was told only the owner takes cards. I will for sure be going back for more piercings though.</text>< pictures>

I am so upset! I got my nipples pierced here last august and the guy did a butch job. I finally sucked it up and went to another piercer for help at a different shop in murrieta, they advised me to remove them, let them heal, and re pierce the correct way. He basically pierced my areola instead of my nipple. My breasts are now scarred because of it. It's very upsetting! I don't know about their tattoos, but I do NOT recommend this place for piercings. I have 12 piercings and I have never experienced such Unprofessionalism from a piercer. Didn't even give me any kind of break down or talk about after care. Terrible.<//review>

<text>I was asked to review the services of my Tattoo I had done at Epidemic Tattoo Studio in Temecula CA. David Rivera was the artist that did the work on my Tattoo. I would like to say that the studio is really clean and up to date on all thier certifications valid and up to date. That was the first thing I noiticed when I walked in, also, the atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly. David took my art that I wanted to turn into ink on my chest and did an awesome job, I was impressed that it really didn's hurt that much and the colors came out insane. I am going to use David for all my ink work in the future and I think he's one of the best tattoo artists in Temecula.

<Text>We were looking forward to firehouse subs picked for dinner. But when we get there and were looking at the menu one of the girls says its  gonna take 20 minutes till she can take our order. Mind u we were the only two people who walked in to order.  There was no one else there . she said it was because there are alot of online orders. Really!  But there's 2 of u working 1 can't do the online orders and the other the walk-ins. Terrible customer service.Not a good look firehouse! Turning customers away. I won't be going there again.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Sorry guys. This was my first time at this chain and I honestly wasn’t that impressed. The people were nice. There’s no doubt about that. And the spot was clean. On the downside, I clearly told the cashier no tomatoes, and it was noted on the ticket. Yet, I still got them. They’re also a bit pricey, I feel. And I feel you’re not getting what you paid for. Lastly, Jersey Mike’s a far better shop than Firehouse. Firehouse’s turkey doesn’t taste clean. The turkey tastes like it came directly out of a Walmart box. Lettuce seemed like it came from a Subway supplier. Anyway, that’s just my 2 cents. #JerseyMikes #AllTheWay.</Text>< Pictures>

I ordered dinner for my family through Grubhub, we waited for over an hour for Grubhub to call and say that another driver took our order. On top of that mistake, Grubhub customer service called, Firehouse to remake the order and they refused. Why should the customer be at fault for your mistake of not double checking order receipts and correct drivers. Now we have to order from elsewhere and I have to wait 3-5 business days for my refund from Grubhub .I've never eaten here before and I won't in the future.</Text>

Ordered a large Beef & Cheddar and a small Steak & Cheese. First, I'll say the place looks great and staff were very nice! I ordered online and the food was ready when I got there. Very impressed! I actually thought about picking out a table to eat and I never like to do that!

The loss of 2 stars is for the food itself.IMO I think the prices are a little high but that's just me. The main issue is the sandwiches had too little meat for the given bread. Although they taste great (better than Subway), Firehouse has the same problem McDonald's has: their food looks far smaller than what is advertised. At least Subway makes an effort to portion the ingredients so that the sandwiches look like what is advertised. Also don't order a sandwich in the 'small' size. Their small should be given away as frees samples.< /Text>

<Text>Very clean environment, good food selection. Awesome owners as well, as I've met both.  The Italian and Steak & Cheese are my favorite.  Now yes, I've had a Philly cheese steak in Philadelphia before...don't expect the same. But it is still a very good sandwich in its own right. Give them a shot!</Text>< pictures>

Sorry but I had a horrible experience here. And I hope they do improve but the food was awful. And the customer service was terrible and next to nothing. Would not recommend. No wonder it was empty of people here.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Nathan Snyder</user_name><Review>Pretty darn good!  Sandwich will fill you up and make you never go to Subway again!  The only issue I had is that the company is known for taking donations to help buy life saving equipment for local firefighters and in return they give you a old pickle bucket that's red and looks neat.  I was told at this store that the manager doesn't allow that because he keeps them for personal use. So, I wasn't allowed to donate money for that cause, even though the signage at the door stated that I could...  Something seemed off with that...< /Review>< date>

This is such a good sandwich place! This was my first time coming to this place and it was a great experice. We ordered a hook and ladder large sandwich and split it in half. Was more than enough for the both of us. They have over the top great customer service and delicious food. The place is very clean and food came fast. Would recommend it to everybody.< /review>

We tried the New York Steamer and it was absolutely delicious! It was a gourmet deli with excellent customer service provided by the very owner. He explained to us the  quality of the meats and the process of how the subs are made. The place is cute, clean and hygenic. This is a MUST GO TO place.  It is definitely recommended. I promise you will not be disappointed.<//review>

I love firehouse that's the only reason I can't score less than a four. But... if your going to own a firehouse and have people fall in love like I did a long time ago you MUST!!! Must!!!! Get the two most important parts about a firehouse sub right. First you have to have that bread toasted it's a must and second have the meat steamed for the proper amount of time. This place was very clean and friendly but the subs weren't toasted at all. :( the sub won't be amazing if the breads not toasted. Please toast the bread!!<//review>

I ate at this sandwich place for lunch. The servers were courteous and they brought my sandwich to my table. I ordered the Firehouse Meatball sub as a hot sandwich. The meat was good but the bread was fluffy and light. The soda dispenser was neat: many different drinks were possible, and were dispensed in the same pipe.< /Review>

<Review>The sandwiches are better than subway in certain ways but the sandwiches are generally more expensive by quite as bit. Subway has an advantage of better bread selections but the meat advantage goes to Firehouse.< /Review>< user_id>

<Text>Customer service is not very good. Lady took a long time to take my order even though I was the only one there.. It was my first time going to this franchise but she act as if I should already know how to order the subs and know the ingredients they have. Ordered my sub and they gave me a hot soggy sub even though I never asked for them to heat it up. Bad first impression.. I'll just go to subway.. Seems a lot simpler< /Text>< Pics>

<text>This place needs time to get on it's feet. A few mistakes but the staff was extremely courteous.
***UPDATE***Second time. No surprise after they get a customer base the customer service has gone down. The subs are over priced yet still better then subway. I'm knocking off two stars one for the decline in customer service and another because it didn't improve after it's original grace period.

When my wife and I got to the store we waited for 10 min for our order to be taken than it took another 30 min for our sandwiches to arrive. This is too long of a wait for a sandwich someone needs to fix this issue.< /Text>

<Review>This place is super clean and very hot. There was no ac running or a fan. Other than that very nice staff they let you sample whatever you want and are patient. When I arrived there was no one inside I quickly realized it was because people took their sweet treats to go since it was solo hot in there, I don't know how the staff does it. Either way great location good tasting paletas.</Review><user_name>tee tea</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80dcb4c92f7a9093:0x3782ac611a9d4de2< /Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>103785419148190312458< /UserId.></record>

It was my favorite place to go for a late night dessert but alot has changed. They don't sale corn on the cob anymore (number one reason why I would go) the esquite seems to be from can corn now. They change employees constantly so every worker prepares things a different way and the one lady who seems to be the only one taking orders now doesn't seem to know portions or how to prepare things (at least to my taste) the place feels humid or hot which is pretty strange for a food preparing location it should be a cool place being that food is being handled. It just seems like they have lost alot of costumers. Before I would see a line waiting behind me but now their lucky if at least one more couple walks in. I'll just start ordering from the michoacana bar on foothill now, they seen to have more variety and better tasting desserts. Bummer cuz this location is just down the street from my house but its ok I'm done getting upset with my wrongly made orders.< /Text>

<Text>6 out of 5 stars .
Great service and amazing treats.
Tried the mangonada, best I've had.
Tried the Mexican corn,  a little watery but still tasted awesome.
Had a scoop of Gansito ice cream, I called my mom to smack her over the phone,  it was so good.
So many flavors to choose from.<//Text></record>

I went in To buy ice cream tonight and as I walked I didn’t see any sign stating you had to wear a mask. Also the fact that the gentleman in front of me wasn’t wearing a mask and they served him. When it came to my turn the young lady told me to go get a mask. I had told her, “you help this guy and he doesn’t have a mask.” She replied to me saying she didn’t notice.  This was after the fact that she took his order down, he had paid, and was awaiting another item to be done for him. How do you not notice him not having a mask? But are very quick to tell me to go get a mask to get service. Unfair and uncalled for. So I left. I called the location asking to the managers name and phone number and the young lady that answered asked the other woman that works there if it was okay to give that away. Quickly, that other woman tells her to hang up on me, which she did. I called again and they started mocking me and acting like they can’t hear me. This happened tonight June 7th, 2020. Around 8PM. I feel very disrespected and insulted by these actions of these rude, disrespectful woman with no class. Never will I step a foot in your establishment and Advise others to not do so either. If this is the service you give, there is no want to spend any money at your establishment. I suggest hiring people that are respectful and have professionalism. Remember, these ladies are your representation for your establishment.</text>

First time customer and I was not happy, came in and was greeted someone asked if we were ready but we needed another minute once we were ready there was no one around we had to wait for the customers in front of us to finish to get help. The ice cream that I wanted was melted, they didn't have corn in a cup and if we payed cash we couldn't get back change only bills. There was no sign anywhere that mention that, I will not be coming back.< /Text>

<Review>Horrible customer service! Wanted to try a new ice cream combination, so I got it. A few bites in made me realize it wasn’t a good combo and the ice had absolutely no flavor, so I asked the parlor if they had a satisfaction policy; she said they did and she could take the ice cream back and replace with a new flavor, but as soon as I went to replace it she was taking someone else’s order and another parlor came to help me. Explaining what had just happened, she said she couldn’t take it back and apologized for the inconvenience. I told her that the other parlor had told me about the satisfaction policy, but she refused to take it because it wasn’t “bad” ice cream, so I said it tasted bad to me- she refused to take it and excused herself.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Yummy! This is my favorite place to get Mexican popsicles, aguas frescas and other popular snacks. The service is quick and friendly. They have water-based and milk-based popsicles and ice cream. They're all so yummy! The hardest part is deciding which one to get. They give you a sample of any ice cream you want. Never a bad attitude. They have chairs and tables for you and your family to sit and enjoy your dessert. they also play kid's movies or music videos on TV for additional entertainment. The place is clean as well.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dcb4c92f7a9093:0x3782ac611a9d4de2<//GmapID></record>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Terrible service, super pushy and super slow women. The owner should pay more attention to that, I waited half an hour for a water and then I removed the mask from my face to drink water because I was already thirsty and I had half an hour waiting and well despot told me to put the mask on, lazy old women should hurry up a bit

(Original)
Pesimo servicio, las mujeres super prepotentes y super lentas. El dueńo deveria poner mas atencion a eso, espere media hora por una agua y emcima me quite la mascarilla de la cara para tomar agua porque ya traia sed y tenia media hora esperando y bien despota me dijo que me pusiera la mascara, viejas flojas deberian darse un poco mas de prisa</Text><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) There is a bad-faced lady who gives you bad attention and looks very bad at clients, I think she has personal problems but she takes them to work, I don't know her name but she is chubby and has given bad attention to my family already My, I think that with that attitude it will bankrupt the business, my family and I personally do not return to that place

Hay una señora mal encarada que te brinda mal atención y mira muy mal a los clientes, creo que tiene problemas personales pero se los lleva para el trabajo, no sé el nombre de ella pero es gordita y le ha dado mala atención a mi família y a mi, creo que con esa actitud hará quebrar el negocio, mi familia y yo en lo personal no volvemos a ese lugar<//Text>

Another relatively safe place to shop for groceries in South Pasadena.   Better prices than Vons but less selection.   Get on their daily deals emails to discover some real deals.</review>

Brand new Grocery Outlet. Super wide aisle, clean, tidy and lots of Organic foods to choose from at a crazy great prices. I went in for the 20% wine discount sale...and found helpful attendants short line and lots of quality items to choose from. I also meet the owner who engaged me in an interesting conversation concerning "how I liked things and what could be improved on, very cool. Please support this new start up buissness worthy of our monies. Wishing Ernesto much success. Respectfully yours, William</text>

This place is amazing! The customer service is exceptional! Anthony checked us out with a smile and good conversation.  They all made us feel welcomed!
The produce is beautiful and affordable.  The meats are priced fairly and nice options available. They offer a wide variety of goods from food to household needs.  Their wine and liquor section is attractive.
There's 9 people in my household.  We shop a lot! We average $75 a day.  It just went down to $50 a day.  Bye bye Fools4Less! Later on Kroger! This place just won me over!!!<//review>

The employees are great however be careful with the the female in-charge of the franchise Karina who by the way changes her last name as she pleases because the Better Business Bureau has her last name as Peralta not Medina. she likes to  profile people and assume you steal from her store  just because you might not fit the her description of what a shopper should look like physically according to her. She will send other employees to stop you and embarrass you in front of the other customers by emptying out your grocery bags even after showing your receipt for the products in your grocery bags. Very unprofessional, so sad that she lacks the customer service ethic that her employees offer gratefully.<//Review>

You can communicate with the person putting your groceries together if there are replacements that needed for out of stock items. Overall, I greatly do love shopping in their store because it was worth it and satisfying. I mean, my needs were all there. Thanks!<//Text>

The owner Karina Medina/Peralta, per the BBB, is very unprofessional and accuses every customer who seems to look Hispanic as a thief. She will send other employees to do her dirty work and embarrass customers. Do not shop at this store let's boycott it!< /review>

Live here. As a resident it's a safe place to go walking day and night. It has flat ground for beginners and elders and hills for advanced walker's. It's Neighbors that judge you for being different that keep it from being 5 star. Nice place.<//Review>

The park manager there is rude, inconsiderate, and down right mean. My girlfriend and I went to visit my uncle there and stopped by the club house to use the restroom, and she gave us a hard time and ran us out of the restrooms... They need to tighten up and learn how to treat people better.</text>

Why is the clubhouse always locked and never accessible unless rented?  Other parks have their clubhouse, pool, laundry etc open till 9 pm. Clubhouse is always locked others close at dusk or at the whim of management. Management also has on occasion decided to not open any recreation area for no apparent reason. Very bad and unfriendly management.<//Text>

<text>This place was so great! I showed Tina a picture of an almond, French tip acrylic set I wanted and what she gave me was better than the picture. I’m really picky with the length but she was really nice when I changed my mind and asked her to go shorter after she’d already done a bit of shaping. She took her time and went back in with the files several times to make sure everything was smooth and even. If you don’t mind the location and want really good quality, go here!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This place is a hidden gem! The one that attended me was precise to the picture, I showed her for my nails. She took her time, did not leave my full set clumpy. Over all very satisfied.</text>

Besides waiting an hour and 20mins , I say it was worth the wait ! My nail tech was so sweet and apologize multiple times for the wait. There was only two of them one only does pedicure which why I had to wait for my full set. But I was disappointed I got what I wanted I wish I could remember my nail tech name but it wasn't Jenny .</text>

<review>Tip Y Toes is a little hidden gem. When I walked in at 1230 I had to wait 25 mins for a mom and a daughter to finish up. My gel manicure took about 45 mins. The nail artist took his time on each nail, and boy does it show! A couple other women walked in while I was still getting serviced, and the phone rang throughout my time there as well. It's a local favorite! If you are in the area and know about the spot, drop in. They also have a small parking lot on the side of their building. That's always a plus in LA!< /review><response>None</response>< user_id>

< Review>
The place is dirty, the equipment is old, and I never even saw a grade. I didn't even want to put my feet in the bowl. Then the woman doing the nails was rude. I ended up just leaving and finding another salon. You can't have a dirty place AND be rude. Come on now.< /Review>

My AC went out, very warm in home. I called to ask for the earliest appt day/time and they were able to fit me in same day. So thankful! Bart arrived on time and was so pleasant and professional. He explained everything very thoroughly and was able to repair the unit same day. I would highly recommend this company (you'd be lucky to have Bart too!), they are honest, professional and do a great job.<//review>

{'time': 1624637244289, 'text': 'Sorry there was a miss communication on the part of our dispatch team when they took your call, they missed 2 key words that you told them "Inverter" "3 indoor units".  If they would have picked up on those than they would have informed you that we do not service multi head mini split systems that we did not install. And a different tech would have been dispatched. And also the tech says he did not "check" the refrigerant level he only stated to you what the error codes that your system is showing states refrigerant charge error.\nSo again sorry about the confusion.'}< /response>

<Text>Technician was nice, however he did not know what he was doing at all. He stated my LG Dual Inverter was completely empty of freon. He then stated he called his boss and they declined to work on the system. They did not charge me a service fee.

I had California Mechanical come out today and the technician reset the unit and it came on. Pressure checked system and it was a little low on Freon. He leaked checked the whole system and found one fitting at the unit slightly loose. Topped of Freon and system works great now.

I would not recommend Fairview for these individual head units as they do not know what they are doing!<//Text><user_name>Louis Towry</user_name></record>

Fairview is so honest with their maintenance service.  They have kept our system viable for 10 years past another company informing us our system needed to be replaced.  With their service our Heating/AC has outlasted most of our neighbors.  With Fairview's good maintenance and honesty they will be our "go to" company when we need a replacement for our 20 year old system.< /text>

Fairview has installed and maintained both heating and AC twice over the many years we have lived in our home.  I have referred them to friend's, who have also used them.  Very happy with their work.</text>

This was my first time using Fairview and definitely won’t be my last. Jerry was GREAT! He answered every question we had and was very professional.
I definitely recommend Fairview Heating & AC for all of your HVAC needs.</review>

< review>
Great company to work with.  Very up-front on pricing and commitments.  They deliver exactly what they say they will and they do it on time.

I had my complete AC system replaced in 2017 and they were by far the most honest and personable company I spoke with.  Others played games and tried to upsell me on very expensive units that were actually too large and would have been an unbalanced system.

Robert came to my home and performed an inspection of what I had currently and ran some numbers for my house and determined what unit size I would need, then provided me with options.  There were no pressured sales tactics, it was very much like I was talking with a person I've known forever and just honest opinions.

The installers were great guys.  They were younger gentlemen that were extremely courteous and professional.

If you are in the Brentwood area and need HVAC service, I cannot recommend Fairview Heating and Air Conditioning enough.  Give them a call and I'm sure you will agree with me.</review>

This is a great small company that offers a great product.  Their communication was excellent and they didn’t try to oversell their product.  They explained the entire process and assisted with financing options. The installation was very professional and resulted in a significant improvement from our original system while also improving the existing ductwork.  The new system is really quiet and seems to work quite efficiently.  Just what I was looking for.  Very pleased.< /Review>

This company was great to deal with.  Robert, the owner, spent a lot of time going over our options.   We feel we got the best deal and service with this company after interviewing several.  Jerry was also great.  Very professional.  Our daughter's coil on her air conditioner happen to break at the same time ours was out. Fairview helped with hers as well, again with great results.  Would highly recommend.</Review>

< review>
Our furnace died a couple of days before Christmas. It’s 24 years old, and we fully expected to hear it needed to be replaced. The tech was right on time (super friendly!), and walked us through the simple repair. We asked about making it more efficient, and he came up with a couple of options. After hearing that our unit was totally fine and should last at least a few more years, we decided to upgrade the fan. We had another service call when the part came in, and things are running smoothly. We will definitely be using Fairview again, and will recommend them whenever we can. They came highly recommended as a small, local union shop. And they were fantastic. Thanks!!< /review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>As it turns out, I live outside the area that Fairview Heating & Air Conditioning services, but I didn't know that when a Google search directed me to them for expert advice on whole home air filtration. I spoke with Robert Conner about my search for such a system. He was extremely knowledgeable and even though we quickly learned that his company wouldn't be able to do the work I wanted to do, he was still willing to help me understand the pros and cons of various systems. Robert sold me a unit that I then installed myself with his expert advice. He couldn't have been more generous with his time, nor could he have been more friendly. I'm a senior citizen and have been around long enough to know excellent customer service when I experience it. These folks operate their business as if their lives and reputations are on the line in every transaction. FIVE STARS!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Our AC wasn't bringing the house down to temp. The repair guy diagnosed the problem and fixed it right away. This company also has very good communication skills. If they can't make it to the appointment, they don't leave you hanging. The tech couldn't make the original appointment because he was out sick, but they let me know right away, and we rescheduled.<//Review></record>

I was so impressed with this company and the technician, Brad! He was knowledgeable and friendly, and really took the time to explain things. I’d definitely recommend this company for your heating and AC needs!</Review>

<Review>I have nothing but the highest of praise for Fairview Heating & Air. We have worked with them a number of times over the years and, they are always prompt, courteous, great workmanship and honest. Fairview communicate and, explain in layman’s terms so that you understand what’s going on. With Fairview, I feel confident that they will always do a great job, they never disappoint.<//Review></record>

Fairview Heating and Air Conditioning provided me with rapid and thorough service. I stopped by their office and talked to Heather who scheduled an appointment for the next morning for one of my rentals that was having air conditioner problems. Ken called 15 minutes before he was going to show up to verify the appointment. He then diagnosed the problem, called me back with the solution and estimate which was very reasonable and job done. Tenants happy, I'm happy, thank you Fairview, especially Heather and Ken!<//text>

I have always received a very thorough check of either the heating or cooling system (depending on season of year) and been advised of any item that was marginal but still functional so I could decide whether to take car of it then or wait until it failed and risk being without that system for a while.  I prefer having the knowledge up-front and taking care of issues in advance (if possible) of any failures.  It is easier on me, my systems and the service repairman.  Thank you Fairview Heating.< /Text>

My experience with Fairview heating and air conditioning from the purchase of a new unit to the maintenance on that unit over the last year’s has been exceptional. True masters of their profession!<//review>

< Review>
Furnace stopped working,  I called fairview around 9am , by 2pm  a technician shows up and  fixes our furnace ! Great company . I know I need a new furnace cause it's 30+ years old  Fairview will be the company I hire to do the work including a new a/c  unit.  Thanks for  fixing my heater!<//Review>

<Review>Racist. They don't service people of color air conditioners. Been trying to get an appointment for over a month. Phone calls and emails are never returned.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1502819183500, 'text': 'I don\'t know where this is coming from or what you are trying to do but....  I came out to your house at 742 Solitude Dr. in Oakley @ 8:00am on June 14th to give an estimate "EST. 8AM. WANTS TO SEE IF HIS AC CAN BE MOVED AROUND THE CORNER.  ITS CURRENTLY UNDER BEDROOM WINDOW, WANTS IT ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE."\nI met you there discussed moving your existing A/C from the right rear corner of your house to either the side of the garage next to the side garage access door, or to the other side of the house.\nI told you I would need to get the price for materials and trencher rental and would call you back.\nI called you back at the phone number you provided 707-712-**** and left a message on your voice mail, this was on the same date June 14th at 3:08pm in the afternoon.\nWhen you did call back in July in the middle of a heat wave you where informed that we couldn\'t do the job of moving your AC at the time because we were booked up solid on service and equipment replacements.\nThe only email I have received was on Aug 9th @ 5:52pm       "Hello Robert I was wanting to know if your company have time for an install. You gave me an estimate and I have called the office numerous times with the same results, "We\'re too busy, Robert is not available, someone will call you back?? In the past month I have called at least 5 times with no call back."\nI responded to you @ 7:29pm " Sorry but I can\'t remember your estimate and I don\'t see it in my estimation program\nHow was it sent to you by email or mail\nAs of today our first open install slot is aug 31"\nYou then replied back on Aug 10th @ 10:53am "It was sent by email. My address is 742 Solitude Dr, Oakley"\nThe last time you called the office you were told to send a copy of the "install" estimate, and we never received it,\n\nI never gave you an estimate for any kind of "install" by "email" if was a verbal quote to move your AC and it was left on your voicemail, you were then told we couldn\'t do the job at the time, and I also replied to your email that we were booked up and couldn\'t get you in until the 31st.\n\nSo again I\'m not sure where this came from---    "Racist. They don\'t service people of color air conditioners. Been trying to get an appointment for over a month. Phone calls and emails are never returned."'}</response>< gmapID>

This Walgreens that is Open 24hrs and it has a 24 Hour Pharmacy too! The Walgreens sells Propane and has two #RedBox movie rental machines right outside its front doors. In addition to Walgreens, in the same shopping mall you can also find a Sprouts Health Foods Market and a Chase Bank, Mountain Mike's Pizza, and Taco Bell is there too!<//Review>

The clerk with the little man bun & tattoos is very rude/apathetic. During check out I gave him a happy "good morning"; he didn't respond & barely interacted with me the entire transaction. I guess he probably hates his job. However everyone else tends to give decent service and I like the cleanliness & location of this store.<//Text>

Pharmacy is very helpful and polite, helped me with cash price of medication. The store employees at check out are always friendly  and kind. When I have called Walgreens with questions my call was answered right away.</text>

Just moved my prescriptions to Rite Aid after 5 years...this pharmacy is the absolute worst for customer service by the techs and the pharmacists.

Rude, disrespectful, cut you off mid sentence. Details would take up an entire page, let's just say it's gotten much worse over the years and rather than be treated like they're doing me a favor, I'll just take my business elsewhere.</Text>

The worst customer service ever. I have been here 4 times and every time their pharmacy is under staffed and the staff they do have are rude. The first couple of times I was here I didnt say anything because I thought maybe I was just sick and cranky but I know it is not me. The lady helping was rude the 3 out of the 4 times I've been here. One of the times she didnt help me. The time she didnt help me it was a rude man. Then they say 30 minutes when they really mean 1 hour, sometimes longer. Now I know never to come back here and just wait until the next day to go to CVS where at least they are polite when you have to wait!!!< /Text>

<review>The head pharmacist at this location is always extremely rude and non helpful. Only reason I fill my prescriptions here is because it’s 24 hours but if not I would not come here!! It’s always dreadful dealing with the pharmacist at this location!!

The pharmacy closes between 2 and 3 am, not truly 24 hours. Wouldn’t be a problem on most day, until it is, and your stuck having to come back in the middle of the night feeling like s..t. So you can pick up a prescription that will hopefully help you feel better. I know 2 am is an odd hour to pick up meds, but it was when I finally felt good enough to leave the house.< /review>

Just got released from the hospital from a csection. I had a prescription from the hospital for norcos for pain management which this pharmacy refuses to fill unless the doctor calls them directly. So now I get to wait possibly hours while this gets sorted out. So apparently prescriptions from my ob at the hospital is not good enough for me to get pain.meds here. I didnt realize an ob had to make personal calls to a pharmacy for a patient to get prescribed medication. And of course the pharmacist is a man, so it's not like hes ever been cut open and experienced half of the pain I'm going through. As if childbirth isn't painful enough. Thanks walgreens<//Review>

The Asian pharmacist that works at night late will not sell me a pack of syringes unless I had a prescription. I need to do a shot of insulin so I don't die and she refuses to sell me a pack. I'm from out of town and had left my syringes at home worst experience I've ever had in my life</review>

Two problems:

1-The pharmacy staff are extremely rude here. I went to pick up my medication and the whole staff looked upset. Well, why do you work here? Nobody wants to see your moody faces.

2- Pharmacy staff shorted me on my sleeping aid(Ambien). Prescription is for 30 days and they gave me meds for three weeks.

Be careful if you come here. BTW: Positive reviews are fake. Do not fall for it.<//Review>

Don't ever use the pharmacy.  After waiting 45 minutes to pick up a med, they tell me they dont have it.  When i tell them to find another pharmacy that has it, they said" oh yeah we have it".. really?! Completely useless!!! I cant believe these people are filling prescriptions!!!  If I could, i would give them a -5 stars!!!< /Review>

Everyone is always nice to me, i used to pop in late at night after work and even though they were usually stocking shelves someone would always check me out quickly. I feel that if i asked someone politely to watch me walk to my car they wouldn't mind. During the day i think the staff works very hard and the location attracts some undesirable shoppers, so if they ever seem short or "rude" it's probably because they had to handle a lousy situation. The photo center is just fine; sometimes it takes longer than an hour for pickup, but for myself i don't mind. I've never used the pharmacy so i can't comment on that. Overall, for a quick stop at a local drug store, this is a fine place to go. Just realize employees spend their day on their feet, the place is always busy and some dirty individuals come in and harass them; so if they aren't peppy perhaps take a moment to say, "thank you and have a good day", a little kindness can go a long way.</Review>

They have a drive-thru pharmacy. Getting medication can be a little infuriating. The pharmacist has to tell me every month, how to take my medication. It takes the pharmacist 5+ minutes to get there and they take a while to explain medications. The pharmacy tech's changes every few months so you have to explain stuff to the new people all the time. There are usually problems since they bill the wrong insurance.

I have been called to say my medication is ready to pickup. When I show up, I get told it is 1 more hour until it is ready. I have been told my medication will be ready in 15 minutes, when I return 15 minutes later they say it will be ready in 15 minutes. This loop can go on for a while sometimes.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This is the worse pharmacy!!! They tell you your prescription is ready and when you get there ...there is a problem!!! My husband went to get my daughters SEIZURE MEDICATION after they called and said it was ready at 9. When he got there they said they had a computer issue..ok fine it happens then after they got the glitch handled they said the medication could not be released..they called my insurance then they said that WE would have to call the doctor to have them OK the release of the medication. My husband was there for 40 minutes and 10 other people were on line and pissed off too! This is the 3rd time there was an issue with her medication. They gave my daughter 4 days worth until they get the OK from the doctor. Mind you they filled her 90 day prescription before so I don't know why there is all of a sudden an issue.
After this...back to CVS we go...this is our first experience with Walgreens. NEVER AGAIN!!!! I NEVER SAW SUCH INCOMPETANCE!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Specially their pharmacy technician, very poor communication skills and rude to deal with consumers. and when you try to complain to the pharmacy manager, that is actually the first one on top of the list for people to be replaced in order for this place to get customers to return back< /text>< pictures>

Course was beautiful. Loved the scenery. UNFORTUNATELY, somebody had broken into our friends car. They had stolen a backpack with a lap top, vehicle registration, insurance paperwork. Watch out for the scumbags that lurk in these parking lots and steal stuff while people are out hiking or playing disk golf. Chico is starting to turn so trashy....</text>

Great disc golf course in the middle of nowhere on the side of a highway to nowhere. Great views of the canyon and the valley. Played it 3 different times now and havent seen another golfer. The signage says the course is closed but its completely playable anyways.<//text>

<Text>The disc course is in an interesting area of upper bidwell, that has vast views of the park's valley along the way. Theres alot of beautiful wild flowers in bloom right now and the disc course looks like is has had an update done with clearing stones that protruded out of the ground mostly. It looks like baskets got an update too and the trails are more direct to the plates. Be careful on windy days with the playing on thecourse because parts of the course is near the cliffs.<//Text>< response>

<text>Mad props to the Chico Outsiders for all their hard work.  I've always enjoyed this course.  Now there is new pin placements on all but 3 holes which has made the course more challenging.   The course is clean and kept up.  I strongly encourage people to play this course if your local or passing through.  I promise it will be worth the experience.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I think they might have been there once but must have burned off since the fire. If you are new to the place you don't know where you're aiming! Still a great place though!</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Was a great course. Highlights are the first 7ish homes overlooking the canyon. I get why it doesn't have signage (signage burns) but I got lost looking for the next hole a few times<//text>

I have played this course countless times. The views are beautiful and the course is well maintained. It offers a number of fun and challenging holes (18 in all). I had began going up there years ago prior to the city stepping in and upgrading the course. A grant was provided to add chain baskets which would replace the older tone poles. Also added were concrete slabs and directional arrows at the beginning of every hole. I try to get up there as often as I can and enjoy it every time! Disc golf is one of the funnest Sports around in my opinion.</text>

Best vistas I've ever seen at a course hands down! Late winter is the best season to play. Only a 10 minute drive up the hill with a 15 second approach. Sometimes there's a portable toilet and a trash can. Warning: not your standard 'let's go play a quick 18 in an hour'< /review>

< Review>
Beautiful and very challenging Disc Golf course. Beware of the cliffs because you wont just lose your discs, a man lost his life from trying to recover a disc off of the cliff face. Beautiful scenary! You gotta check it out and make sure to pick up your trash!!<//Review>

<text>Great technical course with permanent chain baskets. Good elevation changes and difficulty. Very easy to drive past and lots of rocks to navigate, but it’s w lol worth it.</text><Rating>4< /Rating><user_id>103737279978869879430<//user_id><gmapID>0x808329ee4f45454d:0x51af07e1dfbba58a< /gmapID><username>Charles Dell (Charlie)< /username></record>

Great place to play. Very exposed to all manner of weather being that your on top of a canyon. Speaking of which watch your discs on the first few holes. Amazing views. Does have poison oak. Not the best place to try out new disks givin the exceedingly rocky environment.< /text>

Swimming pool is really good and teachers are really nice but I recently experienced very negative behavior by the managing director Olga Garcia. it was so unprofessional couldn’t express in my words expecting it doesn’t happen to anyone 😞 especially when parent is alone with two kids and for everyone be prepared for getting treated poorly if your kid is having to much fun.<//Review>

It can get a little crowded and some people dont watch their kids, some life guards are mean to the kids but then again the kids don't listen to the rules.  Pool is clean and just the enough cold enough to keep you cool.< /text>

<Text>The Swimming pool is awesome. My kids love it especially my 4 year old who has been going there since he was very small. He loves the shallow pool since that's where he has been going since the beginning. We have recently enrolled him and our younger child for swimming classes. I am usually at work during the classes hours so my wife bring them both. The instructors are very nice. However we had a very negative experience recently with this lady OLGA SAUCEDO-GARCIA. Being a Madera County public pool, we expect professional behavior from all staff. My kid went to the shallow pool during his class and did not want to come out. Seeing this  Olga yelled at by wife to go in the water and get him out  and snatched my one year old from her hand. She talked with a ghetto tone of voice and said get him out or he cant come back from tomorrow. I mean C'mon getting upset because a child wants to goto his favorite area of the pool.
Its a Madera county public pool and behaving as if she owns  it and rudely yelling on my wife. No matter what class of society you come from but you should know how to act professionally and supportive.
I went to the pool and even tried to contact her via phone but she didn't pick up. I will call her again tomorrow morning to better understand why such behavior was demonstrated. Additional training may be required by her.
The situation could be handled properly and professionally. But that did not happen and my wife was very upset at the low class behavior. Just a basic human decency and support doesn't cost anything. We will keep on going to the public pool but will be more prepared to deal with such behavior with our guards up. I expect an apology from her and hope no one else has to go through same thing.< /Text>< pics>

Juan in the Alterations Department in Monrovia was amazing!  He was very professional and encouraging.  He was able to get my bridesmaid's dress ready on time on a rather short notice.  He was helpful from beginning to end.  He let me feel at ease that everything would turn out great.  He treats customers with familiarity and charisma. The dressed fit perfectly.  Thanks Juan!< /Review>

<Review>I got my dress here!!!!
Very friendly staffs especially the lady Lien and the Manager. Lots of collections on dress can let you pick, being honest to them on every dress that you tried on, don't be embarrassed to tell them which part you don't like on the dress otherwise you won't find the one which belongs to you!
All of them on each department are so willing to help you, went there for two visits try on different cut of the dress then third visit confirm the one that I love even got second dress because the good deal made me feel like it.

I believe they don't do rental sounds a little bit scary on the pricing, but trust me... the final price was so worthy to me to purchase than rental.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>This was my first bridal gown shopping experience. I greatly appreciated that the person helping me was supportive, listening to what I said. She observed my reactions and intuitively knew when I liked/disliked something. She was far from sales-pushy (unlike my second appointment). She made me feel comfortable.

Edited after 2nd visit-

Even though I didn’t select my dress from here, I loved how professional and organized Diana was here. She made me feel beautiful and reassured. I would definitely recommend all brides to start at David’s!< /Review><Response>None<//Response></record>

I had a great experience with the entire process from purchasing my dress to having it altered at this location. Adriana was so kind to pick out several bridesmaid dresses for me and waited until I selected a dress. I highly recommend you go to this store to try out the dresses rather than purchasing it online. You'll never know how the dress looks like until you try it on. The ladies and gentleman from the alterations department did a fantastic job hemming my dress. I look forward to wearing my bridesmaid dress on my friend's wedding day.<//Review>

<review>As the Maid of Honor for my cousin’s wedding, I was on a mission to order the new lace style one shoulder crepe dress. I could not find it in store, but Charlene was extremely helpful and friendly and reassuring me that we can find something similar that will fit. She directed me to Jenny who accommodated me with professionalism and ease. Luckily, I was able to find something that fit perfectly! From the minute I walked in, everyone greeted me with a smile and made me feel comfortable, but more importantly confident about myself and the dress. I can tell that customer service starts from the top and their Manager, Virginia helps carry out that vision through excellent customer service. I usually don’t like dress shopping, but they made this a pleasant experience!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This place is awesome! From the moment I walked in for my first appointment to find my dress (which I did!!! YAY!!) to every dress alteration and fitting with my amazing team (Jose w/glasses your a God send) it was perfect! I'm a plus size girl who had a very specific idea in mind and they made it come true with no issues or problem! Now, on my wedding day I know I will be a beautiful bride!! Thank you!< /text>

Was so pleased with my experience! Adriana and Lien were amazing at helping me find the perfect dress! My wedding is in 2 months and they assured me they would help take care of getting my dress in on time! Lien brought me a dress that I would have NEVER chosen out of the rack for myself and surprisingly enough it was my DREAM dress . These ladies know exactly how to make you feel beautiful! Don’t settle for anything less than what you deserve this shop will make you feel like you are not alone! Thank you both so much for all the help and hospitality!!!!<//review>

Had an amazing experience at David’s Bridal in Monrovia. I was stressed about finding a dress and they made it so easy! The stylist who helped me was Lien, she was so awesome she made the experience really fun and knew exactly what style dress I was looking for and I was so lucky the first dress she picked out for me was a winner. It was like it was meant to be! Thanks you David’s Bridal Monrovia!</review>

<time>1574538605498</time><review>I had a great experience at David’s Bridal. It was my first stop in my wedding dress shopping trip and I wasn’t expecting to like a dress so much. My bridal stylist Jenny was the best. She was so patient, answered all my questions and gave my great advice. She was so sweet and really hard working to find dresses for me. The only thing I didn’t like from the experience was that she was seeing another bride while seeing me. So she was running back and forth and I feel so bad. The other bride didn’t even wait for Jenny to put on and off the dress. I would definitely recommend any bride to start at David’s Bridal to get a idea of what you are looking for and your size. Make sure to ask for Jenny, you will have a great experience with her.<//review>< name>

<Text>Definitely the best service I've received after going to 2 other bridal stores. I was helped by AJ and she was super helpful in showing me different dresses I might like and was very accommodating overall.

I ended picking my wedding dress at the second visit to David's Bridal and I literally spent 2 hrs there both times and she was super patient. I'm kinda sad they are closing down this location because it's really near my place. :(
I haven't gotten my wedding dress yet, but it's said to arrive in only 1 month! So I'm really glad, my wedding is set for October and I was getting scared because a lot of people were saying that because of the virus it would take a longer time to get the dress and whatnot.

I also got a lot of discounts on my dress because I went to a Bridal Expo previously, they were also having a little sale.<//Text><username>Christy Tang</username>< Time>

I went online and scheduled an hour and a half appointment for my Maid of Honor to try on a few dresses. When we found a dress she liked I asked if I could just try on a random white dress to see how that dress went with the particular dress  she decided on. I was told that even though I scheduled an hour and a half I was unable to try on one dress without an appointment (mind you this was 45 mins in).David’s Bridal made me feel like I wasn’t important whatsoever. I understand their sales people do this every day but for your customers this is not something they do every day. They totally ruined my customer experience and I felt like it could be handled better.</Review>

<text>My experience was great! I walked in the store and immediately found THE dress I was looking for. Diana helped me throughout the whole process and she paid attention to the style that I wanted. Another tip i can give is to go make an appointment on a weekday morning. I went Thursday morning and I was the only one there. I definitely got all the attention.< /text>< pictures>

Good tip, save the cut out fabrics from the dress to add to your bouquet to add a little detail to your dress.

Ladies, just prepare to spend at least $500, it's worth it.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< gmap_id>

<text>Adriana, store manager and Anna with alterations did a wonderful job of helping me with my wedding dress. They warmly greeted me, and were very quick and efficient with their service which I very much appreciated. Adriana found the perfect dress for me. Anna made me feel special since this is not my first wedding; she reminded me that it can be as special as my first, and that will stay with me. I needed to hear that. Come and get your dress here! One stop place for absolutely everything you need. From the perfect undergarments, shoes, jewelry, accessories. Loved the experience. Would highly recommend coming to see Adriana and Anna. They will take great care of you.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The customer service was nice and the dresses were beautiful. I didn't feel rushed or that it was an issue to try on multiple dresses. The only reason I deducted a star was because my appointment was double booked, which took my stylist attention away. I did have another wonderful employee help me out and they were very patient to help accommodate any request I had. Overall, it was a great first time trying on dresses!</Review><Time>1573975056793</Time>< GmapID>

My experience at David's Bridal has been amazing from the start. Everyone there really makes you feel taken care of. From the beginning choosing my dress Celeste was amazing. She made sure my dress would arrive on time. In alterations Ana is the queen. She is so professional and can alter your dress so it fits like a glove. Everyone at David's Bridal has made me feel always welcome and made this process truly memorable. Thank you again!</review>

My visit at David's Bridal was amazing thanks to Krystal, Charlene, and Adriana!! With only 3 months to my wedding, these ladies assisted me every step of the way and helped find my dream wedding dress!!! They were very professional and really supportive when it came down to me choosing my dress. These ladies not only helped me but they also took care of 3 of my bridesmaid and my mother! I will definitely be returning to this location with the rest of my bridesmaids! Thank you ladies!!!<//text>

I bought my wedding dress from Davids Bridal and the whole experience was just great!  I ordered one, then changed my mind and they quickly accommodated my request.  Then they gave me monthly updates as to my dresses arrival day. I've been in there a lot for fittings and every single time, the staff is just Wonderful.<//text>

<Review>It was my first time walking into this David’s Bridal on September 28th. Didn’t have an appointment, but they gladly appointed me to a stylist. Her name is Diana O. She was super helpful from the beginning, very patient with me. Even had some laughs with her. Thank you Diana for helping me say YES TO THE DRESS! I love it so much!</Review>< pics>

I went to try on bridesmaid dresses for my grandpas wedding in a couple of weeks and was worried I wasn’t going to find a dress. Diana helped me with the dress, Cristina showed me what’s available, and the 2 managers ( I think their names were Lydia and Virginia) helped me with my checkout. I had such an amazing experience. I highly recommend going to this David’s.</Text>

I had no idea what I was doing and felt so nervous, but everyone in there helped me right away. I have to give the BIGGEST thank you to Krystal. She was amazing and was so kind. She made me feel calm, beautiful,  and i ended up finding my DREAM dress in one visit. This David's Bridal is one I highly recommend.</Text>< Pics>

The ladies at David’s Bridal were great! I wanted to take in my dress in multiple places and they were really helpful in making it happen. I also needed this done in a very short time... we had about a month to squeeze in all the alterations and fittings...and I didnt live in the area, so the ladies in alterations really had to work with my difficult schedule. They made it happen! They were so friendly and flexible.</Review>

As a bridesmaid, I’d ordered my dress online and procrastinated so much I hadn’t even tried it on, let alone thought about altering it on a timely manner. By the time I needed my dress altered, I was within the store’s rush time frame.
Thankfully, Juan was able to schedule me for my initial appointment within days and made every effort to accommodate my busy schedule and expedite my requests. Although the wedding date was right on the cusp of a super rush, he made sure to have it ready the day before I had to leave town for the wedding.
Juan was so kind, patient, and professional - I cannot be more grateful! What a life saver! The dress fit perfectly: the hem was exquisite and his recommendation on the bust tailoring made the dress lay much more nicely and saved me a few bucks.
So glad I don’t have to worry about fitting into my dress two days before the big day. Thank you, Juan!<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I just left the store (on February 1, 2020) after a harrowing experience with my future mother-in-law. This 1-star review is not about the dress selection because I know it’s not within their control but the customer service that we experienced was atrocious and I am so ashamed that I brought my mother-in-law to this place. I’ve been to another location in Costa Mesa with my two bridesmaids and since I want them to wear white, the stylists gave them the freedom to browse wedding dresses and ultimately we bought two wedding dresses at the end of our appointment. Today, was completely the opposite. The stylist arrived 20 minutes late,  took the two dresses we initially selected, brought my mother-in-law to the fitting room, all without even introducing herself or asking us any details of what we are looking for. Since we were not impressed with the selection, I started browsing the wedding dress selection like I did with my bridesmaids at the other location. May I add that I am completely aware of the process and price range and was comfortable with it. I took a dress towards to the fitting rooms and was confronted by the stylist. She went on to lecture us about the rules of the store such as who is allowed to access the wedding dresses and since our appointment was for a bridal party, we were banned from that area. She then added that she is a special occasion stylist and is not a bridal stylist, but I told her we have a 90-minute appointment and would like to try on more dresses. But she insisted that she cannot help us with the dress since it is not within her expertise.  As I stood there in disbelief, I gestured to return the dress but she grabbed it from my hand while saying, “customers are not even supposed to touch the dresses cause they were delicate.” I mean, she made us feel so unwelcomed - she did not have to take that tone with us. I do not know if she was telling the truth, but even if she did, the manner in which she said it, made it look like she just wasn’t willing to help us, let alone do her job. Her attitude was appalling and distasteful and I can only hope that no one else has the same encounter as we just had. (I am not wishing a response from the store. They have lost our business and nothing can repair what had happened. I simply wrote this review to warn future customers.)<//Review>

I got my appointment and was  waiting for 45 minutes and nothing. Saw someone else come before me and they attended them real quick. I don’t know maybe because  I look Hispanic - I felt like they didn’t take me serious. Won’t be coming here ever again.<//Text>

<review>This was my first wedding dress appointment and it was great. Ayana was so helpful - and actually, my favorite dress was one that she picked out! She was great and made an effort to get to know me and figure out what I liked and didn’t, which was great since I didn’t have many clear ideas myself. We didn’t buy a dress on this visit but have plans to return, and now have a dress that is the one to beat. I’d definitely recommend shopping here.< /review>< Time>

The team is amazing! They measured me, asked me pertinent questions about my likes and dislikes.  They started pulling dresses for me. Adriana Romero is a rock star, very professional and knowledgeable.  Naomi, the seamstress is timely and skilled. I wa out of there in a half hour. Love my dress and the team at David's bridal Monrovia Ca< /text>

I had such a great experience here.

The first time I went to look at dresses I didn't know you needed an appointment, but they were able to schedule me within the hour. It gave me time to look around and see what I wanted to try on... I tried on a few things to see what would work for me, but then the girl helping me (I wish I could remember her name!) pulled a dress that I saw on the hanger a few times but didn't care for it. However, I put it on, had some questions for one of the alterations specialists, and decided on that choice.

At my fitting appointments, Juan, Ana and the rest of the crew were really helpful. Whatever questions I had they were able to make suggestions. They made the dress fit me just right and I'm very grateful for the results. Looking forward to my wedding day knowing I will look beautiful AND feel comfortable in what I'm wearing!< /Text>

Just had my fitting for alterations on my “mother of the bride” dress. The lady helping me, who is the one who will do the alterations, was very nice and told me several times how beautiful the dress looked on me and that it was a perfect fit. I did need quite a bit taken off the hem though. It was faster than I thought and an overall excellent experience.</text>

<Text>Everyone at the store was really nice and helpful! I do wish I was able to try on more dresses that were my style, but then again I am super picky and the person who helped me did her best! She ended up finding me a great dress which I just purchased today!! Hopefully the alterations will be done quickly because my waist will have to be taken in. Great experience overall!!</Text>< Gmap_id>

I came in for my first wedding dress fitting. Angie was amazing. She was so sweet and understanding with all my questions. She took the time to tell me how the alteration process works. She also reassured me on my decisions. I arrived at 12 and they were ready for me without any waiting. Highly recommend for purchasing the dress and alterations.</text>

I was really nervous about dress shopping for my wedding. Lauren made the whole experience amazing! She was very friendly and knew so much about dresses. I was under the impression that I could only wear certain cuts but she showed me some amazing gowns I never knew I could pull off. It was an awesome experience and I am so thankful that Lauren helped me find the one! Thank you so much to Lauren! You are amazing!</review>

Great experiences , great staff...good price ..since I wasn’t looking for expensive or custom gown .. I would give 5 stars if the veils were  not extremely too  expensive (for not being custom made) ......you can get from Amazon same quality but way cheaper ..<//text>

I had such an amazing experience in spite of feeling nervous about the process. Wedding dress shopping can feel overwhelming, especially when you being friends and family who have opinions of their own. I had such an amazing consultant with me who was keen on ensuring that I made a decision on a dress that I  alone was happy with. She was extremely patient with me and I never felt that she only cared about closing a sale. She encouraged me to take my time and make sure that I was 100% sure about my decision. In fact, upon noticing my hesitation with the dresses I tried on, she encouraged me to take some time to think about it and rescheduled an appointment for a later time in the month. I so appreciate her help and the support that she provided during such a nerve wrecking process.< /Text>

I had such a great experience at David's Bridal.
They had so many dresses to choose from and many different styles. My stylists Helen was great. She listened to my vision of what I wanted and helped me find the one. I'm so happy with my selection and the pricing. Cant wait to get married in my gorgeous dress. My alterations appointments with JC were great. He made me feel special everytime and made sure my dress was perfect before releasing it to me. I recommend David's Bridal to everyone.<//Text>

Our consultant Diana was GREAT!! My bridesmaids and I were so indecisive about what colors of dresses to pick. So Diana took the time to pick different colors and helped us to pick out a color scheme. I had been there a month before with Rachel and I was very unhappy. Anytime I would ask her opinion she would simply reply "Well its up to you" That really annoyed me because I was asking for assistance, and she was very unhelpful< /text>

<time>1531079439327</time><rating>5< /rating><review>I had a bad experience at another location but was still looking for a dress months later, so I gave this store a try. Everyone was incredibly friendly and in a good mood. I felt like I was getting the royal treatment! The store is laid out with dresses in the front and different sizes in the racks behind, which makes browsing easy. The dressing rooms are a decent size and there are mirrors everywhere so you don't have to walk down a hall or contort to see the back of the dress. I think the dresses they carry flatter a lot of body types. Everything looked good to great on me, and that is not usually the case.

Carla was my stylist and she was a dream. She was so kind and I could tell she really wanted me to find something I liked. She and the seamstress took extra time to come up with the best solution for the dress I ended up buying. She tried to sell me a few extras like dress preservation and bridesmaids appointments, but I never felt pressured. I have hated dress shopping, so it's a testament to the David's Bridal team in Monrovia that my mom and I had such a great day. I went on a Saturday at 2 pm and there was only one other customer there, but maybe that's because we are having a great wave and it was literally 106° F outside.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2d908fd68e08b:0x621fa7e5e6abace9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ceremony is just a week away and had no dress.  Customer service was outstanding the minute I stepped into the store.  You are given time to walk around and get a feel of the dresses.  Krystal was my consultant and she was great. She went above and beyond. She knew I loved a specific dress but they didn't have my size and she researched so hard to find it.  She was so patient, made my overall experience memorable.  Thanks< /review>

I didn't get my dress at this location because they didn't carry the particular dress I wanted, but the manager Melissa was very helpful in letting me know which other locations carried it. I did come back here for my alterations though. Juan was very knowledgeable and patient with me (I came on a good day when things were a litter slower which always helps). I was a little surprise at how much the total alterations came out to be, but Juan was able to work with me to figure out what was priority  and get to a price point that worked better with my budget. The dress came out amazing, love the fit! I'm ready!< /Review>

I wanted to share my wonderful experience from my first alterations appointment at David's Bridal Monrovia.  I was so delighted to have Juan help me with my dress fitting--he was patient and friendly and even took pictures for me.  I had him try one style of bustle, then another and back to the original again.  He was so patient and understanding pinning and unpinning for over an hour!! I have not picked up my dress yet, but I know with his help, it will be perfect! I highly recommend working with Juan.< /Text>

<response>None< /response><Text>Rachel was  a great help.  i told her the design that interested me, and several options of colors.  She brought several selections and I found my mother of the bride dress.  I wouldn't have found it without her!

One drawback was the dress had a tiny part of the rouching that was coming undone.  I ordered a dress instead of buying the one It tried on.< /Text>< user_id>

If I can give no stars... I would but then it won't let me post.

Once I got there  a rep checked me in but I didn't hear her ask me if it was for alterations
Anyways, I went where she told me and the alteration lady asked me the same if I was here for that. I responded no.  She proceeded to have me go back to the same rep that checked me in.  That rep gave me an attitude saying that she asked me, I responded that I must have not heard her.  Once i was checked in correctly, the rep asked if i was here to find a bridesmaid dress. I told her no just a cocktail dress.  Once she found out that it was for an event tonight, she basically said to go browse around and the dresses on the outer part have the different sizes in stock.  That was it. No more assistance or anything.

I've bought my wedding dress here and my bridal shower at another David's bridal and never had this kind of customer service.

I walked out of there within 20 min. No one ever came to ask me if they can assist me at all.  If this was the case I would have been better off going to a department store.  What a waste of my time.< /review>

We had a WONDERFUL experience purchasing a wedding dress at this David's Bridal!  Kelly was a pleasure to work with and did an excellent job getting us just what we wanted. The whole staff was friendly - and made us feel welcome! We came in for a 4:30 PM  appointment and by 6:00 PM we were walking out with a reasonably priced beautiful dress!<//text>

<Text>I walked in to browse and schedule an appointment and minutes after I was browsing they informed me they had a cancellation.  I was able to take that time if I wanted. I said Yes and Ashley was there with a few dresses for me to try on. She has an amazing flair for this. She picked out some beautiful dresses and helped me with the fitting and accessories.  I wasn't planning on buying "the" dress that night but everything just seemed to fall in place.  Thank you Ashley for making me feel special. She didn't make me feel like a shopper, I felt like I was trying dresses on with family.  It's my first and last wedding and it was a wonderful experience.  I highly recommend this store. Everyone was great! Even though it was late, everyone had a great attitude.  Very professional.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Each time I’ve visited thereafter, the appointments have been nothing less than satisfactory.
The alterations department staff are superb! I feel horrible that I forgot his name, but the gentleman who helped me out at my first fitting was amazing! He was polite, kind, and knew exactly what I needed. I’m excited for my final fitting in a month! 😊</Text>< user_id>

David's bridal in Monrovia was a delight from the moment we walked through the doors! - the woman at the main enterance greeted me and made the bridal party feel very excited from the start. They printed out my favorites from online and had that ready to go. The real magic was when we met Carla!! what an amazing woman , she made sure that every single moment was enjoyable. She was so helpful and fun. We were so lucky to have someone with the same personality as us! The perfect sense of fun and professionalism ! She was there to help at all times and had great insight on the dresses. By the end we found the dress and she was just as happy as my wedding party! Loved her to bits. Overall the whole team had an amazing sense of professionalism and it was such a pleasure.  Thank you !!< /text>

My daughter and I went yesterday to David's Bridal in Duarte California. We had an appointment. Diana helped my daughter pull just the right dresses that look fantastic on her. She looked beautiful. After that Diana help with the veil undergarments headpiece and shoes that completed the outfit. My daughter is so happy and I am happy that it was such a great experience. I'm so thankful Diana help my daughter with this appointment. The store manager was gracious, friendly, and also made it a special day for my daughter. I am pleased that David's Bridal had everything in that store so we were able to complete the purchase for her in one appointment. Thank you so much<//Text>

Wedding dress shopping couldn’t of been much more easier thanks to the great help of Celeste. She is amazing, truly patient and comforting to my needs, my moms and mother in laws needs. I only had to try on 2 dresses to officially dress #2 was a “yes to the dress” I loved it. Once I stepped out to show my mom and mother in law it was love at first sight! This experience is truly amazing and I am grateful that I had Celeste with me to help out! Definitely will refer my sister in laws when it’s their turn to visit David’s Birdal and to ask for Celeste!<//Review>

Took my sister to the store after a horrible experience with dress shopping earlier that day. We went in with no appointment , and the staff said they would try their best to squeeze us in. With in 15 minutes and opening became available and we were paired with consultant AJ. She was the best. So helpful and very attentive . Our whole family was so pleased with her help. When we went back recently for a follow up appointment we requested AJ again and we received the same customer service and help. My sister said yes to the dress on the first visit and AJ made sure that she was completely sure before we left the store. Great experience. We had a horrible experience at the Ontario store and didn’t want to go to another David’s again, but thanks to AJ we had a change of heart. Monrovia had the best help from all employees and friendly attitudes.<//text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Being that this was my first time at David's Bridal, I made an appointment for 1:30pm with my boyfriend for a bridesmaid dressing fitting. When we arrived, I was signed in and the girl who checked me in let me know to wait in the bridemaids dress area and shop around but not take any dresses off the rack and my stylist will come get me and take my measurements and get me into my room with the styles I selected. Well after 25 mins of waiting and just lingering around aimlessly, I was finally greeted by my stylist. She didn't take my measurements or have the dresses ready to go. I dismissed all that because they were clearly busy as it was pretty chaotic and loud in there. Nonetheless my stylist did her best to get to me quickly and help me out despite her mentioning that they were overbooked. Half way through my fitting, a rude employee walks up to my boyfriend and I as I was waiting for my stylist to bring me a new dress and asks if we're part of another bridal party that was across from us and I told her no I'm waiting on my stylist to bring me another size and style. She replies with, "Oh ok, well since you're not part of the bridal party"...turns to my boyfriend and says "you need to get up, these seats are for bridal partys only." We were both taken back and my boyfriend then asks "Well where may I sit ma'am, my girlfriend has an appointment too" and she says, "you're just gonna have to stand" then just rudely walked away. My bf and I looked at each other both stunned and in awe that we just got treated and talked to in that manner. My boyfriend was just sitting there minding his business giving his opinion on my dresses, while other ladies did the exact same thing and also weren't part of the bridal party. Completely molded and embarrassed by everyone looking at us like we're in trouble or something, my stylist then walks up holding my styles and before she says anything I ask her "Are these chairs for bridal partys only? Is it alright if my boyfriend sits down"..she replies with "Oh yeah absolutely why did you put the chair back?" And then I told her exactly what happened with the other rude employee and without hesitating she grabbed a chair for my boyfriend. While everyone continued to look at us, one lady asked my bf what happened and he told her and all the other women that were there and when I came out of the fitting room, they were all complaining about the service they had received and how none of the employees were actually working aside from my stylist. Seemed like she was the only one helping everyone while the other employees just strolled around. Suffice to say by the end of my fitting, we asked to speak with a manager about everything. The manager was polite and tried to remedy the situation but the employee just stood there talking and throwing her 2 cents in, continuously interrupting me as I was speaking to the manager. Finally the manager had to literally turn to her employee and shut her mouth up.....as I saw that happen, we just decide to walk out and I say to the manager "Ma'am this was my first visit and it has tainted my entire experience with this your store."

I don't doubt that David's Bridal isn't an amazing company, but at the end of the day, the level of customer service should be consistent across all the stores. I would not recommend visiting this store.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The person who greets you was very sweet and funny. She calmed me down some. It was until I met the "stylist" that I got all work up again. They didn't have the dress I wanted and said they couldn't order me one because it was a marked down, okay then why is it on your website. Told the stylist didn't want white, she informed me that they didn't have may styles in stock that weren't in white. Tried on a few dresses, she didn't seem to know how to help me decide or point me in the direction that could have gotten me to the correct choice of dress. She was very scattered brained, running around everywhere. She was a very sweet girl, very soft spoken. The place was clean, the bra that was given to me didn't fit, they didn't have a lot of plus sizes, which was disappointing. Told me about the layaway option and that they do alterations in house which was nice. They also have a credit card.< /Text>

<Text>I bought my dress at the Long Beach location. Kellee was my stylist. She was super sweet and she understood I felt overwhelmed and what I wanted in a dress. I left very happy. And was thankful she was so patient. I got an email weeks later that my dress was in, but being that my brides maids dresses were at another location I wasn't sure. I called and I didn't catch the name of the person, but she was the most rude human ever. I called to makes sure that it was my dress and I didn't want to go in vein. She said well if you brought it here then it's here. I asked can you check your system please. And again she said well if you bought here it's here. So I I asked can't you check please? She says ya please hold on, but the most rude attitude ever.  She comes back super bothered and asks for my info says yes it's here and quickly rushed me off the phone. She too more time trying not to help me then just helping. Kellee was sweet, great, bit it's those unhappy employees that gives it a bad name.</Text>< rating>

I walked in not knowing if I would even like the dresses, but I said yes to my dress that same day!
It was just perfect, my dress happened to have a discount as well...BIG WIN so we definitely stayed within my budget.
Loved the whole experience with getting my dress there. Thank you David’s Bridal!< /Review>< resp>

I went for alterations for a bridesmaid dress and JC helped me. He was super nice and friendly being a heavyset woman made me very conscious about getting the dress altered but JC made me really comfortable. I cant wait to see how the dress fits once it's done!<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>Having only 60 days before my wedding, I scheduled an appointment and much to my surprise, I was greeted with warmth, kindness, helpfulness and charm.
I had never been dress shopping nor have I had the experience of having someone help me pick dresses out and help me try dresses on.
Kelly Hernandez helped with my dress selections and boy did she pull one out of her sleeve. Having selected the usual lace dresses with long sleeves, she pulled out a strapless dress which I feared trying on.
Well, much to our surprise, the dress made me look so good and it was such an amazing style and color. I couldn’t believe it! True it was out of my budget, but the look on my mom and my eyes definitely made us appreciate the dress.
We are now awaiting for its arrival and will be getting the hem altered and soon will be accessorizing.
Thank you too all the fine ladies at David’s bridal in Duarte. I truly appreciate your help, your attention and your kindness!</Review>< Resp>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Honestly, I have to say this was the nicest David's Bridal I've ever stepped foot in (and I've stepped foot in a lot in other states haha too). And it didn't just look nice and organized, the employees were so friendly and kind and helpful! I got the pleasure to work with Celeste who helped me, for an hour, try to find the perfect dress to go along with my friend's (The Bride) color palette. She was so fun and patient with me, allowing me to literally try on everything. Just so thankful they made this experience fun and took all the stress out of it. I will definitely be coming back for future bridesmaid dresses! Thanks y'all!<//review>< name>

<Review>Great place to get a reasonably priced wedding dress. I have been to some pretty upscale places on the west side and will say that if you are on a budget and just want to make sure to stick with it, this is the place to be at. I even saw some Vera Wang pieces and great evening dress options here.  I would really love to come back here to do some Christmas dress shopping for work events. The staff is really nice, super helpful and was really good with helping my friend find her dress for her an unconventional wedding. Props to Alicia for super knowledgeable and patient. We could not have done it without her</Review>< pics>

She listened to what styles I liked and even suggested a dress that ended up being the one! She made us feel like family! I would recommend this place, and in particular, Raquel’s service, to anyone looking for a unique, all inclusive wedding dress experience.</review>

I've had nothing but a great experience here at this DB location.  Celeste was incredibly supportive in helping me pick out my dress.  Melissa was warm and inviting when I showed up for my alterations appointment.  Juan took my dress to the next level by tailoring it for my specific needs.  You can tell that this team at the Monrovia location takes their jobs seriously and enjoy it at the same time.  Thank you!!< /Review>

As for today I came in to the alterations department and had the best young man help me with my fitting he was so friendly and ready to laugh with me and my sister through all our nonsense jokes, I am definitely recommending this store to every new bride I know, with everything I have to plan and worry about, this store is not one of them they are so persistent with appointment confirmations pick up dates and even payment plans for the big $ dresses. Sorry I couldn't remember anyones names but I've really met almost everyone in the store at this point and they are all wonderful no matter who you get they are willing and ready to help. 😊</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
The shopping assistant was great. I have never done this before so it was an interesting experience. I wasn’t sure what it would look like or feel like to try on different styles of dresses. I recommended at least once in your life. I think the prices were a little too high for me honestly.  You have to consider that you need to have the dress hemmed an altered as well as purchasing it plus accessories and I just know too much about the fashion industry to bring myself to spend that. Make sure that  you order your dress a few months before your event because they do need time for the alterations. I thought that it was going to be more private. You really are standing in front of a bunch of strangers not just your family and friends. I got to say that the girl was really nice,  i’m not sure if she gets commission but it kind of felt like it.   If I could make it a suggestion it would be to make the dressing rooms more exclusive or more private.< /Review>

I had a great appointment with one of their stylists on Saturday morning. They pulled my favorite dresses from my online account and pulled the dresses that they had available and also some styles that I mentioned I liked as well. I was really happy with their service and walked out with my second wedding dress! :)<//Text>

It was amazing! My stylist was Jenny and she is amazing. She was so sweet, patient and in tune with my feelings. This experience was wonderful and in a big part it's because of the space they hold for the brides and customers who come in.

Thank you Davids Bridal in Monrovia! I said YES to the dress!!<//Review>

<review>I am a bride with so many questions about wedding arrangements. At David's Bridal, they made it so easy and FUN. I had made an appointment originally at a bridal show which helped me use a discount code. They were very professional and gave me all the best options for trying on dresses. Might be cliche but I fell in love by my 3rd dress thanks to the talent of Jenny Yu, my dress consultant. Angie who is the manager gave us all the best tips and told us some options for after the wedding about how to preserve the dress. They are just genuinely good people with the best eye for what you desire. I am looking forward to the best day of my life in my gorgeous trumpet lace gown!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

They told me when i purchased my dress that that sleeves were included then today at my alterations appointment they charged me about 150 extra on top of 200$for heming veryyyy little off my dress. I was upset since they told me it was included if i would of known it wasnt i would of picked a dress that already had the sleeves. -_- not a good experience. If i had more time i would find somewhere else 200$ is a lot to just hem very little off the bottom. So my total today was 350$ which to me is really expensive cause they also added a 35$ tax on top all the other charges . They shouldn't of told me the sleeves were included in the first place<//text>

I went to the Monrovia store on 9/8/17 new to the store, not aware that you need to make an appointment to look around. A woman named Melissa had me sign in and informed me she had no appointments available the rest of the day, even though I didn't ask for one. She asked if I knew what I was looking for, and I said a wedding dress, but I just wanted to look. Told her I had received an email from David's Bridal that advertised a big September sale with dresses as low as $99. She pointed to where they were and another woman that worked there walked over. Melissa said, This is Michelle, and she's looking for a $99 dress. Well, the woman she told that to didn't seem to care. And that made me angry because I didn't tell Melissa I was looking for a $99 dress! I mentioned the email I received, and stated I just wanted to look! Then I started to ask a question, but Melissa saw a man outside that was about to walk in, and she rudely told the other saleswoman something about him right in front of me but was speaking through her teeth and staring at him as he was walking in it a small bag as if he was going to return something. I stopped talking so that Melissa could finish saying whatever she was saying about that man as he was walking in. I thought that was very rude and unprofessional. Anyway, I  finally asked my question, Melissa answered it, and I  went to look at the wedding dresses. I saw a few dresses I liked, but decided I'd rather make an appointment at a different store, and give them my business instead because of how rude Melissa was. She made a very bad first impression with me. As I said, I've never been there before, I didn't know you have to make an appointment to look at dresses even if you're not there to buy it that day, I don't like how she was talking about a man that was walking into the store as if he was about to annoy them or they didn't want to help him, and I didn't want to ask either of them any questions because I didn't want to annoy them since I didn't have an appointment. I saw the faces they made when they looked at that man, and I would bet they looked at me the same way since I didn't know you need to have an appointment, and also since Melissa assumed I was looking for a $99 dress when I didn't even say that! I walked all over the store, and no one said a word to me the whole time. Finally I decided to leave, and not one person said goodbye to me. What a terrible first impression, and what a terrible experience I had my first time ever at David's Bridal. I hope the next one I go to doesn't have such horrible service.</Text>

The absolute best service I've received. I felt like a queen! I literally went in 3 days before my wedding. Not only was I able to find the dress of my dreams, they altered it and had it ready to pick up within 24 hours. The staff was amazing and paid attention to all my needs and every detail. They were so friendly and sweet. I would definitely recommend them for all your bridal needs! They have everything you'll need for your wedding.<//Review>

I really don't like shopping for myself so I don't do it very often.  My daughter's 15th birthday is on Saturday so I had to go get a dress.  My mom recommend David's Bridal, so I went to the Monrovia/Duarte store.  From the moment that I stepped in to the store I was greeted by everyone near the front of the store and asked how they could help me. I proceeded to let them know what I was looking for. A walk me to the area of dresses that I was looking for and then started a room for me.  I was able to find my dress in less then 45 minutes. And a person from alterations was able to squeeze me in and will have my dress ready to go by Thursday.  I was so happy with the excellent customer service that I received they are very professional and very helpful. I would recommend David's Bridal to anyone looking for a bridal dress or just a formal dress.</text>

We came last minute for a "back-up" Mother of the Bride pantsuit, because what we had ordered online months before (NOT from David's Bridal!) had not arrived by one week before the wedding.  We were totally amazed they had plus size outfits, in the perfect soft lavender color,  that fit perfectly, and are of the softest and most wrinkle-free material, yet so elegant in appearance.  Understated beauty. All ready to wear with minor alteration in length that was completed in 2 business days.  I was totally amazed and happy!!  Thank you, David's Bridal!<//Review>

I had an appointment at 2 p.m. on a Saturday.  I was greeted when I first arrived and waited only a few minutes for my consultant to help me, her name was Jessica.  She greeted me and asked me info on the bridesmaid dress I needed to try on.  She looked for my size which they did not carry the exact one so I tried a smaller size- it did not fit.   She then proceeded to measure me.  My measurements were a little off so I was in between two sizes.  She wanted to make sure I chose the best size due to wedding being so close to the dresses' ETA.  Fortunately she found the very dress in a the second size I was in between. I was so happy!  I got to see what it would look like and thankfully it was big enough to say "ok, we can go a size down".  Jessica was super sweet, friendly and communicated details about the dress to me.  I am one to be a little insecure about my body and she made me feel so comfortable my entire appointment!  With all of this said I was in and out in 45 minutes (it was pretty busy so I thought I would be there forever).  It was a great experience.<//review>

Kelly was out stylist and we were very pleased with her! She was very patient and paid attention to what we wanted. We picked our wedding dress in 1 visit (less than 1 hour to be exact). She made our experience totally fun and easy. I will definitely consider David's Bridal for any other occasions we may have. Thank you for everything Kelly.< /text>

I may with Krystal. She was wonderful and helpful. She looked at my favorites on line and I was able to try on a few of those dresses. She suggested others as well. She was a godsend in helping me put the dresses on and explained the process of alterations. I ended up having a selection of 2 dresses I love and am having a hard time making up my mind. Luckily I do have a little bit of time. Krystal also was genuine in her enthusiasm with me and my family. It was a joy working with her to find the perfect dress for my wedding.</review>

Staff is friendly but preoccupied with other stuff. Kept going back and forth. I came very early and no customer around. Showed me limited dresses only. Ask for a vera wang dress and told me theyre above $200 and didn’t bring any to try on. I guess no vera wang dresses available to try on. But I found a dress so I am good. Just that for limited selection only.<//Text>

The ladies who assisted me in finding the perfect dress were all so helpful. It was the experience every bride thinks about when they think of going to look for their wedding dress. The ladies were genuine and helped me to pull my look together with a few cute accessories. I left there feeling joyful and satisfied :)< /Text>

Such great prices. Brooklyn picked out some wonderful options for me- they were ones I didn't think to even try on initially and I ended up loving all of them.  Kelly took care of me when I actually made my purchase and she stayed with my party until the store closed. Anna the seamstress is very sweet and informative - love her. Such a great team of ladies.< /Review>

Very pleasant designer assigned. She was helpful in selecting potential dress styles within preference and budget. ( But, make sure that you have a clearer idea of what you want going in, otherwise it may be overwhelming. ) One downside is that we seemed double-booked with another appointment with not enough staff available.  But, I had my girlfriends to help with putting the dresses on/off and the manager came to assist, so it was fine. We weren't made to feel rushed.<//Review>

<text>Krystal Rivas is absolutely fantastic!! I could not have asked for anyone better to help me find my wedding dress. She is kind, patient and helpful. I was concerned about managing my time, but she assured me that we could take as long as I needed. I tried on some dresses multiple times and she never became frustrated or annoyed. I had a great experience with Krystal and the staff at this David's Bridal. I highly recommend to anyone looking to find a dress!< /text>< Time>

I came with my girlfriend to shop because she is getting married. She had ordered some robes for her bridesmaids I went to pick them up. She had since added one more bridesmaid to her party and needed to order another robe, the staff greeted her when she came in the door recognized her by name and helped her very quickly and were very friendly. We mentioned to them that we were on our lunch hour and they made sure that they helped us efficiently so we could get out of there quickly< /text>

Overall a good experience ordering and altering dress. However, I did have to argue away a rush charge for the alterations because I specifically said wedding was out of town and I'd need it several days earlier but they still put down the date of the event as date needed.<//Review>

I came in to the Monrovia location today to look at bridesmaids dresses. Mind you I didn’t have an appointment. I was greeted with a warm smile from the young lady at the front desk right from the start. She then introduced me to Melissa, the manager, who is FANTASTIC. Melissa let me know that they could fit my girls in no problem. I was then partnered with Rebecca, who was an absolute sweetheart. We are still narrowing down our options, but can’t wait to come back! Thank you Melissa and Rebecca for making our first experience an amazing one.<//review>

<Review>I am doing my 30th anniversary vow renewal in two months. My original wedding dress was stolen from our garage about a year after we were married. My husband promised me that he would buy me a better and nicer wedding dress for our 25th Silver wedding anniversary. Well, for several reasons we didn't celebrate our 25th and but we are finally  celebrating our 30th Pearl Anniversary. My consultant at David's Bridal in Monrovia was Diana. She was great and very patient with me. Because it is going to be my Pearl  anniversary, i was hoping for an Ivory or pearl colored dress. In the end i had to get a nice dress that fit me that same day,  since my wedding is in two months and we had to consider time for alterations. Diana kept trying to find "The" dress for me and kept asking what i needed or wanted to make the dress a 10. She finally found the perfect dress for me. It fits me perfectly, just needs some minor alterations. My only "but" is that it is Soft White not Ivory. In the end i guess this dress is replacing my original wedding dress!.<//Review>< UserId.>

my trip to David's Bridal at Monrovia was ok.  But Jennifer was very nice and patient with me. I fell terrible having her running around getting me different sizes.

Most of the dresses r either a hook/button missing, or dirty. And unfortunately the dress I have my eyes on needs to be order from the warehouse and will take at least a month. Unless I take the one from the store which is dirty and a few hook missing. No thank you!

Also having it trailer with a rush, that's an extra $100 approx.

I ended up getting my dress from Amazon. With prime...i get it in two days.  And also easy return at Kohls if doesn't fit. Just so I dont need to wait a month from DB.<//Review>

Although I did not purchase my dress here I was pleasantly surprised at how great my consultation went! Annie and Emily were so personable, helpful and genuinely nice. I fell in love with a dress but there were just a few small elements I didn't like so I waited and found it somewhere else. I'm glad I started here at davids because the experience I had elsewhere was not as great!</text>

<Text>DO NOT PURCHASE A DRESS FROM HERE.
I went there with my fiance' to purchase her dress for the reception. We picked out the Vera Wang ivory gown. We ordered it and paid for it, and took the dress to England. We unwrapped it and found a HUGE, TACKY stain from a piece of sticky tape on the main layer of the dress. THEY SOLD US A RUINED GOWN AND CHARGED US FULL PRICE FOR IT.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. DRIVE TO A DIFFERENT STORE. IT'S WORTH IT.< /Text>< Pictures>

Kelly was super helpful and made the process easy and very comfortable. She picked out our choices and also brought out dresses we didn't consider but might like. It was a great experience and everyone was friendly. They give you your space to get dressed and think things through and arent pushy. I ended up buying a dress on my first visit!

I had an appointment @ 6pm but showed up a little earlier & did't know if they would help me out. My mom and I were greeted with a smile and were asked to look around to see if anything caught my eye while we waited for my stylist Kelly.  I think we only waited about 10 minutes and Kelly was ready for us. She was wonderful and made me feel comfortable. The manager on staff was also great. I was looking for a wedding dress very close to my wedding date so I was a bit scared walking in thinking I might end up with nothing. I was completely wrong I ended up with a wonderful wedding gown. I had a really bad experience with the staff at the store in Brea. I'm so glad I ended up in Monrovia! Thanks for your help Kelly!< /Text>

<Text>Came in to get a bridesmaid dress and made an appointment for alterations. They really discourage weekend appointments which is unreasonable considering most people work 9-5 weekdays. The lady insisted she had no available weekend times for the next month and a half! I will not be buying a dress here again.<//Text>< username>

I had a lovely MOTG appointment with Rebecca at the Monrovia store on 5/29/17.  I had an appointment and the check in process was easy. Rebecca was organized and knowledgeable and very nice to work with. She proactively checked on dress order times for those I liked and was super helpful with suggestions on assessories and shoes.

I would highly recommend going to this store and working with Rebecca.

On the other hand, I would not recommend the Vista store. Went there with the bride a few weeks ago and we had an appointment. The store was a mess. Check in was fine and we were told our consultant would be with us in a few minutes.  The "assigned" helper never showed up. We waited and then started pulling dresses ourselves. We did eventually ask but the person we asked said that she would help us, although she didn't. She was busy with someone else. We tried on a few things but left after 45 minutes without buying anything. No one even noticed.

The difference between the Monrovia store and the Vista store was quite eye opening. Do not go to Vista.</Text>

I went with my daughter to look at possible wedding dress for her and check out dress' for the bridal party and myself. After only being there for about 5 mins I was ready to leave but I didnt want to upset my daughter, trying on wedding dress' is supposed to be one thing every girl dreams of so I kept my mouth shut. They could not have been anymore rude and they even seemed bored. They first downplayed the type of dress my daughter was looking for and then topped that by looking at her and telling her that there would probably be very few choices for her and I because we are both large size women. Both of us wear a size 18-20, yes that is large size but they also advertize that they carry larger sizes. She tried on a few dress' and we left, she told me in the car how hurt she was and wasn.t looking forward to trying another place. As a mom that hurt me, but we did try another and they were very nice, professional and needless to say she found her perfect dress. Now we'll be bringing the girls and I to pick out our dress'. Davids bridal is missing out on alot of buisness but more important to me is how bad they made my daughter feel. So if your looking for a dress and the experience that goes with i, DO NOT GO TO DAVIDS BRIDAL!!!<//Text>
