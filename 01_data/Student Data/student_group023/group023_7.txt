I just started working at Roseville Care Center and I have been really impressed so far. I have known about this facility for over a decade and have always heard good things about them. Now working here I can understand why I have always heard such positive things. They are a five star facility but even better the staff are well trained and very welcoming. I am looking forward to working here.<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><text>2 years ago my grandmother was here recover after knee surgery. On the day she was supposed to come home, they helped her to the bathroom and then left her on the toilet unattended where she slipped and fell while trying to get up and was left on the floor for up to 20 minutes. She died that afternoon. They didn't think to call us until after she passed and tried to say she had a heart attack. Her roommate told us what really happened and so did the autopsy. And now my mother is here and having complications after a successful spinal surgery. This place is horrible.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK5_xDTvoDRHJmDoEvjKVtLkePS_JTSspBY2wh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDqyTe5TRYleh_3EeuDPdAB2VATN98C204A8Im=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-s48axFh0Kr_3cSBHx3cJ4AWYma83xvApLHrQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS-T-fblkyPyfXPxFtPISXKWsqyIRln8fz5Hj2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>{'time': 1571345407851, 'text': "Hi Lisa, My name is Jeff and I'm the administrator here at Roseville Care Center.

<review>My Dad was taken there yesterday for physical therapy. I drove over to center to check on my Dad, make sure the place is clean and he is not being tied down. I was not allowed in and told I need to make an appointment. I told the young lady that I was not given this information and someone should have told me of the restrictive visitation rules. She told me the hospital should have told me this information. I do not believe it is the hospitals responsibility to inform me of your centers rules. The center should call me and let me know what the rules are. The next available appointment is Thursday morning. So my Dad will have been there for 3 days without visitation. I have called all day trying to get the nurses station 4 to give me an update on my Dad. What the plan is for his care. I have been hung up on, transferred to accounting and simply sat on the phone listening to how much the facility cares for 15 plus minutes at a time before I give up or am told to try again later. I am ready to take my Dad out of this facility and will be working towards that means.</review></record>

<text>My mother has been in this “rehab” for less than two weeks.  In this time, she was offered medication that was not meant for her.  Luckily she has her wits about her and asked what it was for.  The person went to check but left the pill with my mom.   She then ran back in and grabbed the pill and said “thank god you didn’t take it, it wasn’t meant for you”.  Who knows how often that is happening!  Another day, she was not given any of her medications until around 10pm because no one was assigned to her room.  She is on heart meds and blood thinners.  But the only meds they gave her was pain pill for her broken hip.  She has also been left on the commode for far too long.   How does this happen?  She says most of the nurses and CNAs are nice but apparently they are very overwhelmed with the number of patients and they are the ones suffering!</text>< pics>

<Name>Heather</Name><text>Worst place ever! My relative was placed here after a short stay in the hospital. They never came home like they were supposed to. Their health quickly deteriated. They never appeared bathed. Teeth and hair always gross, never shaved. When asked if they would do it; it was a bother.. Our loved one constantly fell. Why!! The center dropped them off at the doctors with no family aware of the appointment and no one stayed with them. Center blamed family! Never took responsibility for anything alls they cared about was getting paid! Kept changing the relatives room and did not provide any sort of stimulation for my relative. It's hard enough having a loved one in these places but during covid its harder. They did not make any accommodations so that our loved one could be seen when asked. My relative died alone in this place. They said they got covid. I disagree! It was a lack of care for them. I'm not writing this in anger or distraught. This place needs to be shut down. So unorganized and disrespectful! My loved one had alhtimers. This is not a place for anyone with dementia or alhtimers!! Our family did not get to say good bye. There was no closure.. I blame the faculity for the lack of care! when they knew he was dying!
They are mistreated and forgotten. No response from this facility will change that.<//text><gmapID>0x809b2008af09a227:0x65a3a3287eab54ba<//gmapID>< time>

Enjoyed my stay. People were wonderful!  Loved seeing their various personalities and the way they shine in their work.

Nice balance of diversity.

The only reason I gave it a 4 rating, is because it is an old facility (building).

People  give different ratings... but if you are communicative of needs and wants, the friendly staff is there for you. Smile.

Be respectful and grateful for every one of them that are there.  :)<//review>

<text>As you may know, Sarah Shewcraft (Sarah Arneson) claims to be an employee at your facility. I'm sure your facility is very nice but I hope you're aware that Sarah is not a very nice person. She is an online bully to those of the disabled community, the lgbt community, and basically anyone she decides to make fun of. I hope you understand.</text>< pics>

My 88 year old Father recently suffered a terrible blood infection and was hospitalized for 9 days.  From there, he needed  additional nursing care so we brought him to Roseville Care Center.  People…while the facility is old and desperately in need of basic updates like paint, carpeting, new TV’s, etc.…please don’t mistake it for a sub-par facility.  It is absolutely the opposite!  The staff and care givers there truly do care about each and every patient/resident and go above and beyond to see to their needs.  My Father’s stay was absolutely terrific!  He loved his nurses and physical therapists.  My only negative comment is to the owners of the facility.  If you want a true ROI, go visit your facility more often and invest in basic upgrades.  You will bring in more business for sure.</review>

I was scheduled to have rehab there after hip replacement.  I was transported there from the hospital. I was put in a room.  A gal helped get on the bed: she hurt me doing it. (Remember: is had a hip replacement!)   No pillow; she brought me one within about 5 minutes.  I was then alone for 35 minutes. No water. No aesthetics on the toilet to help me get up from it.  It was noisy — tv blasting from other rooms, and constant announcements over the loudspeaker.  I told them I was staying.
I left.   Six days later I get a package of “admission” paperwork to sign.

First of all, it smells like death in there. Also, it is understaffed, so patients are not well attended.  Every room, including the hallways, is small and dimly lit. It is humid and crowded. They were unable to diagnose my friend's terrible problem, then gave up trying to diagnose it of because of an insurance issue. They just allowed his condition to worsen. We had an ambulance take him to the hospital a few days ago because he kept getting worse (of course). He is still in hospital. He will not be returning to RCC. The staff is polite, though.< /review>

My mother, Dorothy, (age 84) was sent by Kaiser to Roseville Care Center for extended care through Medicare and Medi-cal following a heart attack (CHF). While the decor is not the latest, they actually focus on what is important for the residents. The Care Center is clean, nice meals are cooked on site, the staff has empathy and always maintain the dignity of each resident. We were only there a short time and the last 5 days my mom was also under hospice care. The staff was very caring and my mom was moved to a private room; a cart was even brought in to our family with refreshments after seeing how many hours we were by my mom's side. We really appreciated the care and compassion shown to my mom and all of us from the Director of Nurses, RN's and CNA's.<//Text>

I have noticed on many occasions when I am visiting my relative that some of the staff either do not clean up after themselves or they do not leave the room the way they found it. For instance, yesterday, a nurse and a CNA came to perform scheduled duties for my relative and after they completed their task. They had not put things back the way they found them and they just walked out. Very sloppy. The staff should pay attention to that and at least show respect to the resident and their families by not leaving the room in a mess or moving things out of the way and not putting them back how they found them.</review>

Very poor care. Some of the staff here are very rude and inconsiderate such as Joel and Cherry to name a few. I do not recommend this place to bring a loved one.< /Text>

<review>I do not recommend this place at all. Most of the staff do not like to do their jobs and it is extremely difficult to find someone to help. On many occasions, I would put the call light on for someone to come and tend to the needs of my relative and no one would come. One CNA named Joel I found to be very rude and unprofessional. He would always leave a mess behind every time he came into the room. This place is terribly below standards. Most of the staff simply do not care and it shows in their lack of work ethic. Very disappointing.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I called for basic information. They were very unprofessional and misinformed me. I even asked to talk to the main boss and after 20 sec of explaining what happened prior, she hung up. Then calling back she hung up again after saying, " I cant talk to you either".<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pictures>

Horrible communication between departments as well as to family members. The facility always smells of urine and feces and the rooms are often dusty with dead bugs on the windows. Poor quality of life for the patients.<//review>

<text>We were overwhelmed by the smell of urine in the halls as soon as we walked in. Patients were sitting in the hallways screaming with absolutely no one looking after them. The facility was grossly understaffed, dirty  and run by and uncaring “caregivers.”<//text>< Name>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Amazing massage!  I've been to my share of resort spas and high end spas and Massage Concepts is hands down the best.  True deep tissue massage with all the knots gone and feel like a noodle when I leave.  If you really want a great massage with therapist that really know what they are doing this is the place. Only suggestion is drink a lot of water after and if is too hard, let them know as they know the true meaning of deep tissue.  I bought six 90 min massages and go every chance I can.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Eva has hands like a microscope as she pin points every knot & tight muscle in your body. She has strong hands that I felt like she pulled every toxin out of my body and shot them out of my fingertips. I literally felt my body get in a euphoric feeling from the start, and my body was immediately relaxed. I have been going to various massages for years, and I never enjoyed such a beautiful CLEAN and relaxing atmosphere. The ladies took great care of my wife and I, and we both felt very safe as they used all the proper measures to assure our safety. From masks to spotless rooms, I can see how they clean every room after from the sheets to the floors. I wish I would have had a picture of the room that had valentines hearts made from rose pedals on the beds. Please don't forget to tip these hard workers! 🙏🏽💙</Review>

<text>I've been going here for years and get massages all over the country. This is the best place, no matter which therapist you get. That person that said they aren't hygienic was lying and likely didn't see the person change the sheets. This is top tier in cleanliness, professionalism, expertise and intuitive healing. I don't even live there anymore but it's the first place I go when the plane lands and and the last place I go before leaving. Thank you Massage Concepts.</text>< Rate>

<Text>My sister and I went for massages for our girls weekend and our experience from beginning to end was excellent. We were greeted warmly and were immediately escorted to our room.

<Text>Massage Concepts is incredible. Hands down, the best massage in San Diego (pun intended). Prepare for major goosebumps and pure relaxation!!! All of the therapists are great. I had Winnie most recently and she is amazing! Prepare to be thrilled.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc089ccc64787b:0xcee99d9c9a39f0db</Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

The BEST place to get a massage IN THE COUNTRY. The people the own and the people that work of MCDM are the most knowledgeable, kind, professional, skilled and compassionate I've probably really with in any service field. I've recommended them to my patients and they all said the same wonderful things. You will always leave here feeling decompressed and refreshed. And with their hours, you're often able to get in anytime you need. Just the most wonderful place!< /text>

So sorry I never visited Massage Concepts sooner. Could not have  been happier with the Swedish massage I received from Jessie. Not only was it the best  massage I have ever received she took the time to give extra attention to my shoulder as I am recovering from an injury. So impressed I will be purchasing a package!</Text>

This was rather painful than enjoyable. People seem very nice but I needed a professional treatment so I asked for the 60 minutes deep tissue massage coupled with the 60 minutes foot reflexology massage for around a $100. I had a fresh wound on my knee so I pointed that out to my masseuse and she acknowledged. 3 minutes later she rubbed that wound too hard I had to freak out! She apologized and I thought to myself it’s unfair to judge already so I endured.

The session went on without a clear character or anticipation on what she was going to work next. Long story short, I suffered another two rubs on my wound that it began to bleed - the whole experience was painful and I left the place $100 less and with the same state of mind.<//review>

I absolutely love this spa. Today, I had Jessie and she focused on my back mainly for the deep tissue massage. Man do I feel better! I have been to this spa 6-7 times now and have never had a bad experience. I highly recommend. The receptionists are also always wonderful!</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I see Nancy and she is petite but SO strong. She is very kind and gives a wonderful massage! I really look forward to seeing her. She is careful to make sure things are good as the massage progresses - am I too hot, cold, how is the pressure, etc.. I do 90 minutes every other week, which helps so much with my fibromyalgia. They usually have a good special offer which is really nice too - and there is a discount for pre-paying for a package. I have done their CBD massage as well as their aromatherapy upgrades. I highly recommend them and wonder why I didn't realize they existed sooner. I spent WAY too many years at Massage Envy.</review>< Pics>

Dont dont change out their sheets after each customer.
They only fold it to look new/ replaced.
I stayed back after my massage only to see the masseuse folding the sheets & towels she just used on me back on the bed.
That means those before sheets are the same ones I'm on.
So gross.</Text>

< Review>
I got a 90 minute deep tissue and foot reflexology massage and I was pretty dissapointed. I’ve had many deep tissues massages before and this was not like my typical deep tissue massages. She didn’t massage the knots on the sole of my foot and a lot of was just agressively rubbing it with a towel. She didn’t dig or loosen the knots in my back and neck but just did deep stroking up and down my neck. She didn’t get the knots in my shoulder blades or upper neck. The best part of the massage were the legs and when I turned over and she quickly massaged the tops of my shoulders. Good prices though.< /Review>

I have been here a few times with my girlfriend. The rooms are comfortable. The first few times it was awesome. The last time was horrible for both of us. The massuse??? (Not sure how to spell itl) literally beat the hell out of us. Not sure what happened. They do always have deals and there a few good hipster places to eat around the area. I would say its decent for relaxing if you get the right person.<//text>

I had a 90 minute massage by Jesse and she’s officially the massage therapist of my dreams! She packs a punch and I literally felt like a new person when I left. I definitely recommend and I’ll definitely be back next month!< /Review>

Food was tasty. However, the slowness of the kitchen was remarkable. We were seated at 1:00 with a reservation and were finally served at 1:50. The restaurant was not overly crowded. A very disappointing experience. The Magic Flute needs to gage the preparedness of its kitchen to its staff and to the guests.<//review>

I have ordered the Roti Prata with a curry dip sauce, the curry is very tasty. As I watched the waitress offer my order, I was in a rush to try it because it was mouth-watering. If you want the one without the curry they have a vegetarian alternative for this. It's named the Roti Prata. The roti is a nice thing, I really enjoyed it.<//review>

<review>RESERVING DINERS BEWARE!
As a longtime SF resident, I've eyed Magic Flute for awhile based on the positive reviews, and finally got around to reserve it for brunch today. I experienced a very disappointing FiRST-  when my partner and I arrived, we were told they were unable to honor our reservation, and asked if we could come back at 1:30 (2 HOURS later).  The frazzled hostess explained that they had several large parties.... but as I explained to her, this makes zero sense as that's one of the primary benefits of using an app like open table- the system shouldn't allow overbooking past capacity, especially for the first seating of the day.

I will not be trying to go back to this disorganized place- far too many options in the city that care about customer service.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I really enjoyed their Lox bagel. It’s a great place to bring your significant other or a great place to catch up with an old friend. The waiters are very nice. It’s a family owned business and the owner will still shake hands with each customer as they are leaving.< /Review>< UserId.>

This is one of the best breakfast spots in the city. The Beignets are AMAZING.

It's also a great dinner spot as well. The pasta and wine is great. They have cute lights at night that hang in the outdoor seating area and it makes for a great ambiance.

Great spot.< /Review>

The owner does not know anything besides excellence. His mission is literally excellence. His burger is the best burger ever, no sauces needed. Just a bun, the meat and caramelized onions. Quality of meat is astounding.<//Text>

I think we may have found our weekly Sunday spot! We sat in their outside patio and had the most delicious coffee, brunch, wine and dessert. They actually let us enjoy our meal without rushing us out, which is really important to me. The host was friendly and so accommodating. Can't wait to come back! :)< /text>

<text>Quaint, very friendly, small Italian restaurant in the Laurel Heights hood of SF. Family-run for almost 40 years.  Food quality and service are both very good.  If you're seeking a quality, quiet, no-atmospheric-frills kind of experience (think classic Italian paintings and murals on the walls), this could be your place.< /text>< Pics>

We Had the pleasure to enjoy the Mothers Day brunch menu! The menu was limited however with a large party we were able to see many dishes, the service was very good but clearly the staff was busy, I'm also taking into consideration it was Mothers Day!
The restaurant is quaint and cozy, a neighborhood feel, the pricing was fair. Only street parking so keep that in mind..
The Owner was very accommodating!< /Review>

Great food, but *beware* that each item is a la carte - including the mineral water on the table ($7 each). Unfortunately during my party's dinner the garlic bread and appetizers were presented as included, but were charged separately. The waitress asked after ordering our dishes, "what would you like to start with?" and "(which) would you like, soup or salad?" pushing us to order more. Otherwise, good service and warm, homey atmosphere.</Review>

They make a very good home made whipped cream with a blend of marscopone and cinnamon that is delicious. Has a lovely court yard and is a neighborhood gem.</text>< Pics>

Best breakfast I've had in a long time. Sat on the back patio, soft jazz and standards playing, fresh air and some of the best service I've received in many a year. Food was amazing. My son had the beignets and they were the real deal. Out of this world. I had the chicken hash and my wife had the chorizo scramble. Everything was perfect. Nice to know there are oases like this in this rapidly deteriorating city. What a neighborhood gem!< /review>

My current 3-star rank is all about the brunch, dinner might be a better idea. Let's start with the bottom line first

The good
* Mimosas were great
* Quiche was very generous. Huge dishes overall

The bad
* Eggs Benedict - I usually complain that I'm given way too much Hollandaise sauce, in this case, it was almost non-existent, which made the whole thing very dry. Eggs were overcooked, and the potatoes on the side were most probably microwave re-heated or at least didn't feel fresh
* French toast was dry and very mediocre. I think this was the first time I didn't mind sharing one with others.
* Pizza - It's an Italian place, so we had high expectations - Very meh. Just a very mediocre, regular pizza. Nothing to write home about.
* Service - We were five people, with five different brunch orders and it took about 25-30 minutes until we got our order. We were not too hungry, so that was fine, but we did get to the point in the conversation when you begin to ask yourselves "where is our food" and look around.

It's an OK brunch, but with the high number of other, better brunches you have in the city, I would advise against getting one here.
The place itself is nice, and the crowd was older from I usually encounter in other locations. That's not a bad thing, of course, just an observation. While I might come back and try the dinner service, I won't be coming back for a brunch</text>

I loved this place! The food was delicious and portions were plentiful. I ordered a pizza with caramelized onions, honey, arugula and prosciutto. My partner had a pork chop topped with a fog jam and crispy brussel sprouts; both were very good. They had a nice wine list, but only a few bottled beers. I'll definitely go back!</Text>

Nice texture and Crispy *Lasagna (Special Menu) - It's just OK. It seems overcook a bit. *Big Bowl of Mussels - It's so yummy! the sauce is great.</review>

<review>Extremely friendly people serving up hearty portions of Italian food. Despite the tablecloths and well dressed wait staff, the prices were quite reasonable. If you come for brunch, I'd highly recommend their cinnamon and sugar beignets and the smoked chicken hash. And be sure to make reservations so you can snag a place on their back patio.</review>< pics>

Amazing food and amazing coffee... REALLY AMAZING COFFEE... Had mediocre service, it took about 15 minutes of waiting before they took our cards, I'm sure it's unusual for that happen though and the food is definitely worth any wait there.</text>

The key to a great experience here is being seated out back in their patio. Brunch is decent, but food alone probably not enough reason to go. Good mimosas, friendly staff, and great brunchy ambiance on the patio make it worth the visit.</Text>

Although the menu has no vegan options, the staff was very accommodating.
Service was great.< /text>

I reserved a table for party of 10 via Opentable, and credit card details were not asked. I received a call from the restaurant, and I was asked to provide my credit card details over the phone. Tried to explain on the phone that this was not requested while I was trying to reserve the table on the app (Opentable). Before I finish my sentence, that person hung up on me. That was so rude!!!< /text>

A disappointing experience. My first time. I ordered the smoked trout and fettuccine. With Caesar salad. The salad was not a true Caesar. It was served with whole leaf romaine. Cheap cheese. Not the right blend of dressing ingredients.
The trout entree was a plate of fettuccine. I could barely find the trout, which was little flakes of overly smoked trout. I’m not sure it was trout because the smoked flavor was overwhelming and cancelled any sweetness or natural flavor of the trout. It was prepared with lemon, basil, and a green pepper. Again the peppers which were supposed to be mild was very hot and again overwhelmed any citrus or basil flavor.
Fettuccine was not fresh made.
They served Hawaiian roles instead of fresh baked bread.
I had the Cab Franc.  Again. A disappointing choice. I think it was old. It had a peculiar note that smelled like a chemical, not oak or berry.
Just a terribly high priced meal with the wrong combinations of flavor or compliment.
I do not recommend.
Nothing Italian about the meal-  maybe Mexican fettuccine.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I have had extensive dental work including oral surgeries, braces, several implants and a cosmetic smile makeover and as a senior citizen, I have worked with multiple dentists in my life. There is absolutely no one I would rather work with than Dr Vasanthan!  He has a unique gift for achieving exceptional outcomes in difficult perio procedures that result from his unique combination of personality, total commitment to patient care and extensive experience and training.  I don’t write reviews very often but it is a pleasure to recommend Dr Vasanthan to you.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1628712550874, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words of appreciation Gary !'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

Have 4 implants that was inserted the last  few years, 2 each time.  They are wonderful,  and I will be getting two more implants soon.  Have had no problems.
DR Vasanthan and his staff are great to work with and would recommend them for Perio Dental to anyone asking me for a referral.< /text>

I was very pleased with my experience at Perio Specialists of Roseville.  Dr. Vasanthan’s team works efficiently and effectively to make one’s appointment go smoothly.  The staff are friendly and positive.  I was especially pleased with how Dr Vasanthan explained my condition and it’s prognosis using old & new X-ray photos.  Last but not least they worked out a financial plan that was perfect for my situation.  I highly recommend this practice!<//Text>

<text>This periodontal office works as a team to make your experience the best!
Dr. Vasanthan is an incredible surgeon. I experienced minimal pain for a complex periodontal surgery, a clean office, friendly and educated dental help all the way around. I especially liked that I was not over medicated, thereby allowing my own immune system to engage in my healing process. Any questions that I had for Dr. Vasanthan before, during or after my surgery were answered via text or email within a very short time.
I would definitely recommend Dr. Vasanthan. It is a pleasure to work with a caring and professional periodontist.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Vasanthan is a remarkably skilled and caring dentist / periodontal surgeon. And his staff lives up to his standards, in skill, professionalism, and just human caring.

<Review>I had an awesome experience at Perio Specialists with Dr. V.  I had the procedure three months ago.  I went from having very thin gum tissue around my bottom teeth to thick and healthily gums.  And I am only three months in to a six-month to year recovery.  Not only are my teeth protected now, my main goal, but visually my mouth is prettier now.  I had other consults that recommended two surgeries and tissue from the top of my pallet.  Dr. V did it in one procedure and took it from just above my upper teeth.  It was great to do it all at once.  Also, I understand taking the tissue from the roof of the mouth is more painful.  So, if you need this type of procedure, contact Perio Specialist.  You will be super happy with the results!  I know that I am!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1612027071124, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words, Lori.

<Name>Mary Cage</Name><Date>1624060766843<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Dr. Vasanthan and his staff are top-notch. I had an emergency where I was in a lot a pain, and they were able to fit me into their already busy schedule to evaluate the problem tooth. They scheduled a deep cleaning the following day. The dental hygienist, Mary Ann, was very calm and reassuring, which I really appreciated since the tooth, already evaluated by my dentist and an endodontist, was seriously stressing me out and now causing my jaw to swell. After a course of antibiotics I will have a bone graft procedure and we will also see if perhaps the tooth has a fracture not visible on the x-ray. My situation was atypical since my pain level didn’t correlate with the x-ray. Dr. Vansanthan and staff showed great patience and concern for my well-being and I have complete faith that we will soon get a permanent resolution to the problem. By the way, a couple of months ago my husband also had a procedure with Dr. Vasanthan and he was extremely pleased with the outcome.< /review>< pictures>

Hi all.  I just cannot speak more highly of this office, their staff, and the super care I received. I had 2 separate experiences there:
1st time I went -they saved my tooth! I broke a tooth at the gum line, so they had to “Roto Rooter” around the tooth to “lengthen” what was left of my tooth to adhere a cap. Super job!

2nd time I went was to do a full extraction on a different tooth 😓, and do an implant. They were so incredibly professional, kind and I felt no pain.

They have all the high tech equipment in office to verify every step was carefully planned. Getting an implant on an upper tooth can be tricky if your sinuses are close- and mine were!  No infections no troubles and I’m good to go for my final cap.  I hear advertising all the time on the radio for one day implants- no way if you really know all the details of what’s involved!!.  This office does thorough, impeccable, and safe work. I trust them - my dentist trusts them and sent me - TWICE!

Super hoping I’m done now for a loooong time!  Be safe all.<//text>

So today I had my 5th.I believe,  procedure with Dr. Ash. I have had many horrific dental experiences prior to working with Dr. Ash.The first and second times coming in for a procedure I was very apprehensive. This Dr. is so kind, understanding, empathetic, reassuring and honest about every one of my situations. I slowly dropped my guard as he delivered positive results while being honest every time. Today was no different and he helped me avoid unnecessary work that I does not go unnoticed. Today was the the best yet, as I had no doubt he would do the correct job with his exceptional expertise. I wasn't nervous at all for the first time ever. I knew I was in the best hands out there. Thank you so much! Your staff and front desk are the best too.</review>

Since I am a dental hygienist myself and work in the profession, my standards for quality are very high. Dr. Vasanthan is someone that my general practice refers to for periodontal work and so when I needed to have surgery,  I went to his office. I had Root planning and gum grafts completed in his office.  I was very impressed with the  professionalism of everyone in the office, from the front desk, assistants and hygienists to Dr Vasanthan himself. The financials are discussed way in advance so you will know exactly what to expect the day of the procedure with no surprises. The quality of care you will receive in this office is second to none! I felt totally at ease knowing that I was in good hands. I never felt any pain during the procedure and minimal discomfort in recovery. In addition, many times Dr Vasanthan has hosted continuing education classes for other dental professionals to learn the newest techniques of the trade. I have attended many of these classes, watched a live surgery, and learned so much about the newest procedures of periodontal treatment. Not only is Dr Vasanthan a great Periodontist but he is a leader in his field. I would recommend this office to anyone who needs work and might be apprehensive with treatment. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!</Text>

< Review>
Would recommend Perio Specialists to anyone having work done on their teeth/gums.  Very professional staff and attentive to your needs.  During my past procedure, I was thoroughly informed on what was going to happen and what was happening during the procedure.  The safety of patients is also a top priority, especially during COVID-19.  I felt as safe as anywhere that I’ve gone with the protocol they have set up. The procedure was expensive, but I don’t have anything else to compare to.  Pay by cash or check and get another 5% off.  I am happy with the results and will continue to return for my yearly checkups and any surgery needed.< /Review>

This business deserves more than five stars. I've been coming to this office since 2015. for my first implant. Dr Vasanthan and his Team specially Bianka ( she deserve  a raise ) have always provided me with exceptional pain free  treatment and care thats why i  drove all the way from Bay area  to get my second implant .  Dr is so knowledgable when it comes to answering any questions you may have regarding treatment . If you are looking for a place that values your concerns  provide care kindness and directs you to the right path with peace of mind, I definitely recommend this place.< /Text>

I just had implant surgery not too long ago with Dr. Vasanthan and I am grateful that he was my surgeon. The procedure was very easy, as Dr. Vasanthan explained everything in detail before starting and I was put at ease. He carefully planned my case and there were no surprises during the surgery. Recovery was quick, very little discomfort and I was able to return to work without too much modification of my schedule. Thank you, Dr Vasanthan for an easy surgery and I can't wait for my new teeth!< /text>

I have lots of anxiety about the dentist but was so relieved when I had the work done and felt no pain!:)) Dr. Ash explained to me what needed to be done so I could understand. He made me feel totally comfortable with the procedure. The results were awesome!:) Tina cleans my teeth and does some deep cleaning. She uses numbing gel and I feel no pain!:) I have no anxiety going to their office!:) All the ladies answering the phone and working in the office are incredible!:) I recommend Dr. Ash and his staff to all of my friends❤️<//review>< pics>

Dr. Vasanthan performed both of my gum graft surgeries over the last two years and I have received the best of care. All of the staff are professional, friendly and provide exceptional customer service.
During my meetings with Dr. Vasanthan he was patient, understanding and took the time to answer all of my questions in great detail. When I had to drop into the office due to a surgical area that would not stop bleeding, I was taken into a room instantly where Dr. Vasanthan assessed the issue, calmly explained what he was doing, and put in another stitch. He is one of the best doctors I have ever had as has treated me with respect, honesty and genuine care. He has truly found his calling. I would not go anywhere else.<//Review>

Dr. Vasanthan is an amazing doctor. He performed a gum graft for me many years ago. I needed another one. When he moved his practice, I contractually was not able to see him for 5 years - so I waited! He's THAT good. He is personable, kind, experienced, and thorough. His office staff is very easy to work with, organized, extremely pleasant, competent, and kind. I will never go anywhere else!</Review>

It is hard to believe that I am saying this, but what a wonderful experience. Dr. Vasanthan was awesome. As much as I don't really care to see the dentist, he made me feel very much at ease and made sure I understood the entire process that was going to occur. He took the time to answer any questions about the process that I had, and completely addressed any concerns that I had. Not only was Dr. Vasanthan awesome, but the rest of his staff was as well. I would strongly recommend this office to anyone, especially those with anxiety about going to a dentist.</Review>

I have been  coming to this office for over 15 years.  First for root planing, then for deep cleaning, a couple of teeth removals and then implants.  With all those procedures I have always had the best of service and care.  The entire staff, from the front desk, to the hygienists, to the Doctors  are the very  best.  Always professional, friendly, caring, and up to date on the latest procedures.  They take the time to explain all the procedures, from the beginning to the end.  No surprises.  And, for those of us that are a little afraid, they are able to calm our fears and help us get through anything that needs to be done. I never dread my dental appointments.  In fact, I probably have way too much fun.  Most people can not say that about their dentist office!  Give them a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Sincerely, CB in Lincoln, CA.</Review>

<user_name>Dino Rosetti</user_name><date>1572310070389<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I was so nervous about getting my wisdom teeth removed that I dealt with the pain for months.  It got so bad that I was eventually chewing one just one side of my mouth.   I finally took my dentists recommendation and met with Dr Vasanthan and team.  When I got to my appointment the front desk was very kind and answered all of my questions. They showed me a video about the procedure, reviewed all of my options, and walked me through the details of the cost.

I was still nervous but they reassured me multiple times that all would go well. I was sedated and my procedure was so quick, I was sent home with my wife in less than an hour! They really took care of me there and made sure I was comfortable through the whole process! They are professionals and I highly recommend them to anyone who has pain with their teeth, my experience with them couldn't have been any better!  Thank you Roseville Perio!

The procedure was very quick and simple, and now a week later my gums have been healing nicely. The staff has also been very helpful with any questions and concerns I've had post surgery.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809b1f906e78ad2f:0xce062694c9cc2c86< /GmapID></record>

<Review>I met Dr. Vasanthan when I was looking for a dentist for my daughter that needed extensive dental surgery and implants.  He made me feel that he really cared about my daughters well being, explaining step by step the procedures.  Dr. Vasanthan did an excellent job and the staff were there for me also.  I recently needed gum surgery and felt I would be just fine with him at the helm.  I was right!   He runs a top notch professional office with a down home feeling.

This dental practice is first rate. My hygienist Tina was extremely professional and knowledgeable regarding my needs for deep root cleaning and the necessary steps needed to keep me out of the dentist office.
From the moment I walked into the office I was treated as an old friend and warmly welcomed..

Comparing this practice to others I have been to over the years, it's superior.<//Text>

For so many years I was very self conscious about the gaps in my smile. I tried wearing a bridge but found myself never really benefiting from it. Eventually I talked to my dentist about the option of tooth implants and he referred me to Dr. Ash’s office. Initially I was very nervous about the idea of implants and the process that long comes with them. But from the consultation to the final appointment I’ve been comfortable and the experience has been wonderful. Of course, the process is long and takes patience, but it was worth it. Dr. Ash and his staff are all professional and kind — and of course, they do incredible work. Finally, I have my full smile back and I have also seen the benefits in the way I chew. I would highly recommend this practice to my friends and family.<//Review>

After going through a horrible experience with several dentists and needing to have an implant removed and replaced, my neighbor told me to get an appointment with Dr. Vansanthan as that is who she went to.

I knew after my first visit that I had finally found someone who really cared and understood what I had been through.  Needless to say, I needed bone and gum grafting and even though it was not a fun experience, I put all my faith into what he was doing to correct my problem.

His wife is my regular dentist and the two of them work together to make sure my implant area stays healthy.  They both explain things in a way I can understand and I always feel comfortable with them and their office staff.   I am greeted with a smile and leave knowing I have had the best dental care I have ever had.<//Text>

I was having some major gum issues which I thought would result in losing all my teeth.   However,  upon several treatments with Dr. Vasanthan, my gums have been repaired and my teeth have been saved.   The process seemed scary,  but all of the staff made me feel like everything was going to be okay, which it was.<//text>

Very attentive and professional staff.  The office atmosphere was welcoming and calming.
Dr Vasanthan did a comprehensive evaluation and his using a visual medium, helped me comprehend what treatment I needed. All-in-all,
my procedure went off without a hitch. Dr Vasanthan is a rockstar of his profession.
I drove 200 miles, I would drive 500 more...
Thank you Dr and staff...<//Text>

I was referred to Dr. Vasanthan by my dentist to check on my dental implants. I ended up seeing him on several visits and had one dental prodecure done.

Dr. Vasanthan is simply the most capable surgeon and the kindest, most caring doctor I have ever had. He has demonstrated how much he cares about me in every interaction, from the warm greeting on each visit to the reassurance before surgery, from the personal phone calls I received after my procedure all the way through to my latest interaction where he said everything was looking good and there was no need to schedule another appointment.

Most doctors barely seem to remember who I am, or care about my health holistically, and just want me to keep coming back and paying the bills. Dr. Vasanthan is a breath of fresh air in this regard. He has always put me as the patient first. He has demonstrated that time and time again. He stands behind his work and said he was willing to work with me if the results were not what we expected. Of course they were, because he's the best at what he does.

Dr. Vasanthan's staff mirrors his warmth and kindness, and every interaction with them was a pleasure. Honestly I felt a little sad as I was leaving my last visit, because I wouldn't get to see these amazing people again. Of course as soon as I have any issues with my implants, I won't hesitate to call them up and schedule another appointment.

If you are looking for someone you can trust, and want the best care with the most capable doctor, and the kindest staff, look no further than Dr. Vasanthan. I guarantee you will be thrilled with the outcome.</text>

My 82 year old father recently had 4 implants placed and he said it was the best experience ever. The entire team at Roseville Perio takes amazing care of not only my dad  but of all the patients we refer. Thank you for being a five star office!<//text>

Dr. Vasanthan and the office staff was so wonderful.  I have a fear/anxiety in dental offices.  From the moment upon arriving for my procedure I was greeted with sincere,  professional compassion~ the staff did everything right in understanding my fears. Dr. Vansathan was great in explaining everything he would be doing and made me feel at ease.  I will always go here for my extended dental work.  A huge shout out to Roseville Periodontal.  Thank you 😊</Text>

My recent experience with Dr. Ash and his staff was exceptional. Dr Ash clearly and concisely explained everything about my procedure. He welcomed all questions.  His staff were friendly, knowledgeable, professional and approachable. My procedure was painless.  I was surprised and happy to get a phone call from Dr. Ash asking about my well-being the evening of my procexure. This office and staff are
exceptional. I highly recommend them.</text>

<Review>I had a very positive experience with Dr. Ash and his group.  I was referred by my dentist, Dr. Comfort for an implant that could be challenging: extra care might be needed to keep the implant from compromising the sinus cavity.  Dr. Ash, his office and staff was professional, kind, and understanding of my "unease" with dental procedures.  Frankly, I never knew what happened.  The procedure was basically a non-anxiety event for me.  There was minimal pain that was easily treated with ibuprofen and no noticeable swelling or bruising.  I will easily go back if another implant were to be required at another time.< /Review>< Rate>

I got lucky finding this Perio office several years back. I needed a lot of work done and have been so happy with the work they have done. They are so friendly and professional. I really like Dr Vansanthan,  he is honest and doesn't push on things you don't really need, like some I have gone to. Tina is the best, she is so friendly and makes you feel so comfortable. You can ask her anything and she takes the time to fully explain any procedure.
Afraid of the Dentist? Not with them, they make sure you are comfortable and feel no pain. I highly recommend this office.< /Review>

Absolutely outstanding dentist and office staff. If anyone decides that implants are a viable option then this is the place for you! They work with you on financing options and there is never any pressure of any kind! Been going to their office for 6-7 years now! Highly recommend!< /Text>

<Review>Very happy with my implant treatment at Roseville Perio, which came highly recommended. I appreciated that Dr. Azarnoush took the time to explain the process and what to expect. Everyone in the office was very friendly and turned a stressful dental issue into a manageable experience. I don’t think anyone ever wants to see a periodontist, but if they need to, Roseville Perio makes the experience as pleasant as can be.</Review>< pics>

I had a few areas of recession on the left side of my gum line. I decided to have both the upper and lower areas treated w donor tissue at the same time to strengthen existing gum tissue. Dr. Vasanthan, his colleague Dr. Azarnoush, and the entire staff were very professional, competent and caring throughout the process, from pre-op to recovery weeks later. They were responsive to my questions and made time for me to come in to the office when I had a concern about how the graft was healing. I never had this kind of surgery before, and because I do have sensitive gums, I have become pretty anxious when I have to have any dental work done. I very much appreciate the expertise of the team here, who seem to work really well together.<//text>

GREAT PROFESSIONAL TEAM
I recently utilized the peridontial services of Dr. Ash Vasanthan and the other members of his team and had an excellent experience.   Dr. Ash presents a very warm, professional image and indeed is patient, listens to your concerns or questions and responds in very clear terms that builds your knowledge base as well as your confidence base.  His prior additional experience as a clinical instructor really comes through in terms of how he conveys a superb understanding of your current condition and what to expect with any future treatments.   Mary Ann has a very easy going competent style about her as she performs her hygienist role and shares a lot of helpful information before, during and after any treatments.  The front office (Jessica and Chandra) present a good first impression and they efficiently deal with billing/payment issues, reappointmet and any further questions.   They handle all their duties in a clear and thorough manner.  The overall office setting is very nicely furnished and laid out to give you a calm and soothing experience.  The various examination or treatment rooms are arranged so that  you don’t feel you’re competing with other patients for the attention of your care giver and that any discussions are with you and you alone.  They’ve really done a really fine job of developing a quality practice with all the participating team members to give you the best periodontial experience.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Many years ago I had dental implants by Dr Vasanthan.  The office was very happy courteous and attentive.   Dr Vasanthan was very professional and did a great job explaining all aspects of the procedure including what he would be looking for as I healed prior to going to my general dentist and having the teeth made for my mouth.  Everything went well and I had the the teeth finalized soon after.
Following successful implant surgery I chose to have continuing dental hygienist care by Tina, one of his dental hygienists.  Early this year I was diagnosed with cancer at the base of the tongue from UCSF oncology. They required certain dental work be done prior to start of radiation therapy. I called Tina who brought it to Dr Vasanthan's attention and got me in within a couple days a major feat in itself due to their schedule.  They did a quick exam and referred me to an endodontist for a root canal.  They tried to set up appt but that office was closed and followed up with email notifying them of my condition and circumstances.  I was able to contact them the following work day and made appointment for the procedure.
As I am sure you can tell Dr Vasanthan and his staff are special with both caring and attentive staff.  I cannot tell you how special i felt to be under their care.

When I initially decided I would like to have dental implants, I did a lot of on line research to educate myself about procedures, risks, and costs.  I found some clinics hyping great results at low prices.  These on line advertisements sounded too good to be true, so I steered clear of them.  I dug deeper and learned of patients who had suffered devastating jaw disfiguration subsequent to surgery performed by incompetent surgeons.

Fortunately, I also learned of Dr. Ash Vasanthan through diligent research.

Still with some trepidation, I entered Dr. Vasanthan’s suite for my first appointment, where I was greeted by friendly, professional staff, Cabrina and Sheri.

Dr. Vasanthan patiently detailed the procedures that I would need.  His explanations were accompanied by visual aids, which made the process easy to grasp.  Dr. Vasanthan also clearly explained risks involved with the procedures.  His patience and honesty, combined with his knowledge, kindness, and professional demeanor, convinced me that I had made the right choice coming to him.  It was also good to see that his staff thinks exceedingly well of him.

I am 100% happy with my dental implants, and wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Vasanthan, not only for his expertise and surgical skill, but also for his warm and thoughtful staff members, one and all, who go out of their way to make every visit a good experience as does he.  Special thanks to Cabrina and office manager Sheri.< /text>

Between Dr. Vasanthan and MaryAnn....they are a winning team.  Dr. V did my gum surgery and MaryAnn takes care of the deep cleaning I need 3 times a year.  They are so delightful working hard to ease my anxiety at each visit.  Can't say enough good things about them!</Text>

<Review>Having recently moved to the area from the Bay Area, I was in need of a dentist and ultimately, a periodontics/implant specialist for a potential major implant procedure. After a thorough examination by my new dentist, he recommended I see Dr. Vasanthan, a highly reputable periodontics specialist in the area that had vast experience in procedures in which I would need. Upon my initial visit, Dr. Vasanthan was upfront, honest and very thorough in assessing my situation and advised necessary procedures for my implant. He informed me my procedure might require an extensive amount of bone grafting due to the large gap left from the extracted tooth and informed me there might be a 50 percent chance an implant would even be possible. I was impressed by Dr. Vasanthan’s knowledge and expertise in treating similar cases and it was comforting that he didn’t rush me into a decision just to gain another patient. He and his pleasant professional staff carefully explained the necessary procedures, expected timeframe and my insurance coverage. I confidently proceeded with Dr. Vasanthan.  After nearly five surgical procedures over a two-year period, I can proudly say with a confident smile how grateful I am for Dr. Vasanthan’s brilliance in all the necessary surgical procedures that resulted in my successful implant. I appreciate everything he and his staff did to make my implant experience a positive one. I highly recommend Dr. Vasanthan to anyone considering an implant or related surgical procedure.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>The work done by Dr Ash Visanthan was absolutley superb!! I highly recommend him to Anyone needing implants placed.
Dr. Visanthan did the most amazing job.  If you take a look at the bone grafts  in relation to the implant placement ... superior work.
He is so smart and truly is an expert in his field.
I would recommend a perio specialist because he takes into consideration the bone/tissue aspect of this process.
Anyone who is in need of implants or periodontist should call the office. His staff are one of the kindest and caring staff I have ever had the pleasure of talking to. The first impression and care that the staff gave was pivotal and so important to me when I started this journey. I would recommend Dr. Visanthan hands down!!
He is worth every penny I spent!!<//text>< UserId.>

A great restaurant that my friend chose. Near the shopping buzz in Union Square, we ate here before we shopped for the day. I didn't know what to expect but once the workers saw my friend and I standing outside waiting for the store to open, they opened the door so we didn't have to wait in the cold. We were pleased at their generosity!< /Text>

<Review>This restaurant has great food and an extremely polite staff. The food was very good, yet VERY expensive, but the restaurant is in Encino so think of the clientele. The food was delicious and the sides to share are very large, perfect for a family meal. We ordered the creamed corn, cream spinich, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms as side and they all were great. The banana sugar cake was AMAZING. Delicious food all around.</Review>< pics>

Went on aug 4th and it was a 5 star service.  Food was great and service was excellent.  It was so good that I wanted to take my wife back for our 13 year anniversary so we booked it again for 8/16/20 and told reservation we are coming in for our anniversary.  When we went there they welcomed us and wished us happy anniversary.  Everything again was going perfect food was excellent and service was great but why I'm giving them 2 star it was my anniversary I even ordered dessert but they didn't even write anything for our anniversary when most of the place when u let them know in advance they write or do something special.  My wife was little sad.  Our waitress was extremely nice but she didn't even wish us once and I'm really surprised about that.  I don't think she was notified of the occasion otherwise at least she would of wished us once.  Very disappointed</review>

Nice to have a chance to thank everyone at Larsen's Steakhouse for our wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.  The incredibly gracious staff served us a perfect meal (on hot plates).  All of us appreciated the obvious time and energy that went into making things work so well.  Not an easy thing to do on a holiday with a restaurant full of high expectations.  Loved every minute there.<//review>

Great food and perfect service.  Ordered way too much food but loved it all.  Helpful managers and waitress helped select the perfect wine.  Little older crowd threw me off, didn’t have valet parking.  Would say it’s perfect for everyday steak night but a little lacking for special occasions.  Will be going back for sure.<//text>

The Service: Sitting at the bar. The bartender is very friendly and attentive. The service is excellent. They treat customers like VIP.

The Food:

Macaroni & Cheese - They add in sun-dried tomato and bacon bites. Love the texture! Creamy cheese but not too much.</Text>

<review>The prices are very high, but the food is amazing. The steak was tender and juicy, the sides were hearty and flavorful, and even the bread was specially made, warm and fresh and with cheese.

<resp>None</resp><Text>Parking was easy. (Always a plus esp in LA). The ambiance was nice, cozy, romantic and enjoyable. They have a piano player, who played a few old time favorites. We got seated right away. Our  waiter Jamie gave us Grade A service. Why I chose to give it the 5 stars. The service was superb. The food was delicious overall. I had the Ahi Tuna tartare and Heirloom salad, which were both on point. The shared favorite was the Macaroni and Cheese with sundried tomatoes and bacon. Oh how delectable that was. Relished it. We also shared the creme brulee, which was a little underwhelming. The berries fresh, the cream fresh, just was expecting a little more creme and a little more burnt sugary crust. I would definitely come back for the service and to try the steak.<//Text>< Rate>

I like the environment of this place. Very unique and old school. However, had a bad experience.

First off, the server was kind of rude. When we sat down, we immediately noticed how dirty their little plates were. We brushed it off like whatever bc we weren't planning to use it anw. Then we got our bread w/ little bowl full of butter. One thing that I found unique was that their condiments were displayed by the walls. It was a bit hard to grab some since ppl were besides it.</Text>

We spent the day in Santa Barbara, and needed a last minute reservation at a hotel. Everything in Santa Barbara was crazy expensive, so we looked in Oxnard and booked the Courtyard. The hotel is right off of the freeway and very easy to find. We were really happy with the front desk service - they were very welcoming, were..</review>

<text>The service is not bad, but the prices are outrageous and not justified. The food is average, nothing special. The special which costs $125 was advertised as 16oz of prime meat. It barely contained 11oz of thin sliced regular beef covered in gravy. I was not impressed.< /text>< Name>

<text>I'd give Larsen's 5 stars but there have been a few times where we haven't really loved the food, so until I find it more consistent I have to give it 4.  That said, it's one of the best steak houses in the valley.  We love the Lobster Bisque.  The last time I went I had a cajun steak special that was by far the best steak I've ever had there.  Unfortunately, the rib eyes have been hit or miss.  Many times there isn't enough seasoning.  But, when we have a special occasion or just want a nice night out - we typically choose Larsen's.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1550347451026<//Time><Rating>3<//Rating><text>The pitch is 'High-class Steakhouse', but the delivery is slightly less.
The restaurant is located in a two story mini-mall in Encino. Parking is underneath & will cost you $5 to self-park. The room itself is small in comparison to typical steakhouses and lacks the leather booths you get at Musso, Ruth's Chris or practically all others. I was there a little after 6 on a Friday and it was packed already. I ordered the dry aged New York strip and, at $65, it wasn't as infused and flavorful as you'd expect, but it did have the nutty nuance dry ageing produces. It's not a rip-off, but expensive for the overall product. I asked for bread twice and never got it. Sides were tasty and generous.
Overall, the service is ok and the quality is good, but at $100 for a steak, two half sides and one drink, the price point is too high. Better steaks with better service are available elsewhere.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Another one of my favorite lunch spots...so, some tips for first timers who have never tried Larsen's Steakhouse on Ventura Blvd.

Starting with the steaks ... if you love steak, you have to get the 16 oz Marinated Rib Eye.

If you're not a beef fan or simply want to avoid red meat, the Salmon is my favorite alternative.

And for those times when your appetite demands a hearty sandwich, then go with the Prime Rib French Dip.

In fact, everything I've tried from their menu has been delicious.  So, go to Larsen's. Eat up. It's terrific.< /review><pics>None< /pics><userid>117169193082735377200< /userid>< date>

<Review>The food was amazing, the service.... Woefully lacking for the pricess your paying. A table full of empty wine glasses with a full bottle of wine sitting on the table and a portion of the meal brought out 20 mins after the rest of the table has been served is unacceptable...shame on you. They did compensate on the bill, though then handed us another tables left overs. Accidents are understandable. One foul up after the other is simply a sign of incompetence.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Larsen's has been a mixed bag for me, mainly because one time I had their prime steak and it turned out to be almost cheesy-consistency due to the way they buy and store it -- in a plastic vacuum sealed bag.  Apparently, if there is any breach of that bag, it can go bad.  In any case, that was one incident, and I've been back there since and have loved it.  Good wine list as well.</Review>

When I informed her it was incorrect, she went back to the kitchen. Everyone at my table was already finished with their giants steaks before I received my RAW tartar almost 20 mins later. It was terrible.. as if they took the meat from the grinder, heavily added onions and plated. Terrible.< /review><user_id>111462586043052239541<//user_id><Date>1486578441697< /Date>< rating>

<Text>Had to smog a 24ft motor home and Armando was recommended by my local mechanic. He has a large enough bay to pull an 11foot tall rig into and were very accommodating. I showed up around 8am but that is their busy time(people on their way to work)  so they had me come back at lunch time and got me right in. These guys are busy(because they are good) so call ahead and try to figure out a time otherwise you will have to leave your car in line.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

Armondo was great! He informed me about a voucher I could get to help replace my  Catalytic converter. When I took my car in to have the work done, it was done in a timely matter exactly when he said it would be done :)< /Text>

They keep your car longer then they need to! You shouldn't  have to drop your car off for a smog test! They told me it would take 2 hours and they needed me to leave my car there. Chalé! Go somewhere else! Armando isnt there half the time. Very unprofessional</Review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad attention and only Kieren earning the easy money will bring a Nissan 97 with a coupon d $ 500 and that did not happen and that the diagonist did not cover the coupon and if it covers me ami m said the one who iso the dune tuneup program the month and always the same response that did not pass the inspection that charged $ 85 x the inspection and more the parts and I asked him that it covered the coupon and did not give a logical answer and I sent it to contreras shop in fresno sertificado d smog start y in 3 days they delivered it ready and with your smog ready

(Original)

<Text>I went to Lomita's best only once. After looking at the menu, I didn't except much because there were so many options available. You would think they would have a selective menu to become the best at something.

To my surprise; their food was really good, the wait wasn't as long as I anticipated with the huge order that my family made, and the girl helping us was so kind, and very patient. I would definitely come again.</Text><userid>116552564102775598274<//userid>< date>

Always a great dining experience here. Good sized portions of delicious food.  Great breakfast burritos, blueberry pancakes are stuffed full of blueberries. Bacon breakfast sandwich is one of my faves.<//text>

Nice local place,try the fried mushrooms. Good overall, but some items are just missing one little thing from making them really awesome. Can't put my finger on what's missing though.< /review>

<text>This place used to be a good experience, but it seems like every time I go, it gets worse and worse. Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but the service is not good! The ask u what condiments u want and they either give h the wrong stuff or none at all! I have the girl 15$ on a 11$ bill and she didn't give my change back. What happened Lomitas Best?< /text>< Pics>

My new burger spot. It’s not easily visible unless you are looking for it in Lomita Blvd, but it is most definitely worth the stop. I love their island burger: juicy meat, crispy bacon, and grilled pineapple. Anytime I’m hungry and in the mood for that diner burger, this is where I go—even if it’s a few miles from my house.<//text>

This place is quiet the find! The California Chicken Melt is one of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had. Surprisingly tasty and filling... I always think I’d want more but it’s plenty. The Gyro is also excellent! They serve Mexican food and service breakfast all day too. Perfect, especially to-go. By the way, you can also order food over the phone to pick up that day or the next day. Very convenient.</Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>Kinda between a fast-food place and a diner. Order at the counter and they deliver to your table. I’ve had their burger, sandwiches, breakfast, burritos, salads, wraps, chili, soup, steak, and even a gyro. It’s all good!  Only one I won’t be getting again is the gyro. And the fries are excellent!

The breakfast burritos are amazing, the burgers are fantastic, and the milkshakes are to die for.  The staff is always friendly and offer to refill my drink even when I don't ask.  The little touches, plus the delicious food, means that I eat at Lomita's Best more than any other place in the world.  Yeah you might have to wait a minute in the drive thru, but that just means the food is being PREPARED FRESH!!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>They have good quality food anytime I chose to visit them. Yet I'm  across the street from them home cooked food is the reason I don't visit them frequently.  The drive thrue can take a long while but it's  worth the wait and every blue moon you get service without that smile . I assume its just for the customers that visit more often.  Over all they are worth the time.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>I will vouch for their burritos. Very good. I would not go so far as to give it 5 stars, even for the area. In the end, "best" is just a name.</review>< response>

This is such a gem of a place! Don't let its small, side-of-the-road Lomita location fool you - there is great food here at great prices! Everything is fresh and tastes like a home-cooked meal. The bathrooms are clean and the staff is welcoming and friendly.

Breakfast is SO good here. Both the pancakes and french bread are fluffy and satisfying. The breakfast burrito is tasty and huge for a to-go option via the drive-thru window. No freezer burnt hash browns or soggy bacon!  Great selections for omelettes. My go-to is the spinach & feta omelette.

I mainly think of this as a favorite brunch place but I'd be wrong not to let everyone know about two other fantastic menu items here: the chili cheese fries and the chile verde.

The chili cheese fries = generous portion of delicious french fries topped with delicious beef chili and a generous topping of cheese. When I want a treat, I think of these chili cheese fries. It's a big cheat item for me but sooo worth it!

Chile Verde = I'm not generally a Mexican food aficionado. I can enjoy a nice plate of beans, rice and meat but it's not what I usually yearn for. However, I CRAVE the chile verde here. Somehow, the flavor and tenderness of the chile verde here has me hooked. I can't stop eating it and I can't stop wondering when I will eat it again!  I've stopped ordering chile verde at other places because I always get disappointed when it doesn't taste like Lomita's Best.

I really hope this place does not close down! They truly are doing a service to the community by providing a pleasant place to gather for a delicious, casual meal. Thank you, Lomita's Best!< /text>

Unsatisfied with the meal i recieved, fries are cold soggy, my patty melt was a patty with no melted cheese! Not worth the amount, and neither is the service.  Could have went to fantastics or louie burger for the same price and enjoyed it.<//Review>

Good burgers, good fries. Chili was excellent. Fried zucchini needs to vent on drive through orders, it was in a fully sealed box so the steam made them floppy. Overall a good experience.</Text>

<text>Family has gone here a few times, but the food has been disappointing of late. I came in one night at 8:45pm and says it’s open until 10pm. So I’m eating my food and at 9:06 said they are closing. I mentioned their hours of business on the window said 10pm, but they said their drive thru is open until 10 but their dining area is closed at 9pm.  So I had to pack my food and go. Not the best experience and they should make that known that eating inside closes at 9< /text>< Pictures>

The food here has flavour and is made pretty well. My personal favourite are the fries- plain or with toppings. They have a good selection of beverages and milkshakes, which is always appreciated in sunny California.
One thing that I find to be a flaw is the long wait time. Often times we wait around 6-10 minutes in the drive-thru.</Review>

Little burger joint in Lomita, CA but excellent, I love to support my local business and keep them alive. Don't get me wrong but this place will not let you down, don't judge the way the building looks or the people. The food is just that great.

To the owners of Lomita's Best thank you for being part of the Lomita and thank you for the awesome food. Please share this with your employees, they are doing amazing job too.

This review is only based on one visit, and on one item, but I have no qualms about giving it five stars.  I was nursing a pretty substantial hangover, had heard good things about the breakfast burrito, and ordered it with carne asada.  It may have been the coffee that worked wonders as well, but I felt like a new man after finishing it haha!  Delicious, not greasy, highly recommended.</review>

An old converted Taco Bell, it has seating inside and out and a drive thru. The Cook's do not wear gloves when food handling which is odd because I believe it's a state regulation.

It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I love it when new restaurants open in my neighborhood, but there is just nothing good about this place. The food is a joke. I ordered the recommended Avocado burger and the tomato slice was thicker than the patty. All the food just tastes cheap and sad. The prices are really high for the quality AND quantity.< /review>

Decent pastrami sandwich. They give you lots of meat but it is a bit on the salty side.< /Review>

World's slowest drive through with possibly the least accurate order taking. Prepare to wait and always double check your order.

Foods good, at least.

Update: Another screwed up order. Come on, y'all.<//text>

<Review>I love Lomita's Best. They have fabulous food at a reasonable price. They serve breakfest all day, and their value meals really are a value. The portions are large so you get your money's worth. Lastly, the staff is always friendly and helpful.< /Review></record>

They are very lucky they got one star went there an was in the driveway for 20 min. And if I did not ask the person in front of me to let me out I was going to be late for work, unfortunately they lost our business and I was going to recommend them to a shop but that will not happen, good luck...<//Review>

<Text>Their hours say their open till 10 pm 7 days a week . We placed an order at 9:35 and were told we had to be there in 5 mins because they were closing. We live 2 mins away but when we got there we had to wait in the drive thru line on foot because they had already locked the doors up. If your business hours say 10 pm then you need to stay open for your customers convenience not because your employees are trying to get out of there at 10 pm. Things like this matter because I will not go back to Lomita's Best because this has happened to us twice.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd4a6187912b75:0xcad6ab1838fd8ab4< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Hmmmm.  This was my third time eating at this place, and all was good, but today I had the Ortega burger , and I noticed that the "hamburger " was totally THIN compared to most burgers. That was kind of disappointing. I watched the chef make a pastrami sandwich which was filled with pastrami. Burgers and also, the onion rings are no good my friends even said the same.   Get better onion rings.  Beer battered with a thick onion .< /Review>

I have been there twice this year so far...the restaurant and restrooms are a lot cleaner than most Mexican restaurants...that's a plus...I had the favorite according to the staff; of the bacon, avacodo, cheese burger. I ordered it to go and like I always do now, I ask for all the condiments on the side. I do that for two reasons, no soggy bun, I can pick & choose what looks good enough to put on the sandwich, and oh I guess there is a third reason, so I don't get a lettuce, onion & cheese only sandwich...and why are the onions served at "fast food" restaurants so damn "nasty"....
I know you waiting with bating breath for my order the second time...I dined in the outside patio with my Dog "Jack" and had the "T"-bone steak as they called it..with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables...all was good except the steak had a lot to be desired, too thin like always in a small Mexican restaurant, but then again it was $11 and change so I guess I can't complain too much..my Dog had some bones to knaw on along with the hard parts I couldn't eat...I would go back and eat again, they are pretty efficient with the food.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>This place is a hit or miss.  In the past I order tacos and they have been good.  Today I ordered 2 pastrami sandwiches at almost $8.00 each along with fries, a drink and a salad.  Spent about $30.00.  The pastrami sandwiches were served on hard, dry french rolls.  I would call it old and stale, but when I called them to let them know their bread was stale, the girl denied that the bread was old and said it just came in today.  If it was fresh, they did something to it to make it seem stale, hard and dry.  The end result is the same.  Besides the pastrami sandwiches, the other items were okay.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dd4a6187912b75:0xcad6ab1838fd8ab4< /gmap_id></record>

We paid way to much for the food given.  Not worth The price. The cashier was so rude & made us feel like an inconvenience everything we asked for got us an eye roll. Maybe she was having a bad day idk. We went in around 8pm maybe it was the end of her shift who knows.  I just knows that if you choose to work in the food service dont make the customer feel awful because you hate your job.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<user_name>Born2techno</user_name><Review>This is the spot for me for a breakfast. Even though I live near one of thier competitors across from the Lomita library, I ride my bike over  to Lomita's Best. Service, pricing, and delicious mouth watering food, it's just like it says in their name: "Lomitas Best." I would recommend this place to vistors and especially the locals. And they have a "drive-thru."< /Review><GmapID>0x80dd4a6187912b75:0xcad6ab1838fd8ab4</GmapID>< rate>

Damn good breakfast burritos, only gripe is that they always overcook the bacon. The range doesn't always have to be on high.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I had to put a star to put my comment ... but I would not put any ... some Sundays we order food from this restaurant and we realize that they start doing it with a bad attitude all the time in truth if they do not want work better resign they have very bad attention with people ... I do not know if it is because we are latinos or what is it? The fact is that this has been done to me 3 times but not anymore and I hope that they will never be treated like this and make changes in this restaurant URGENT !!!!!! .... VERY BAD EXPERIENCE THE WORST SERVICE I RECEIVED .. ..

First off I would like to say that everyone I met at the center was very nice, (speakers and classmates). I took the 3 hour class where the speaker lectured to the students in regards to how to make money in the stock futures and options market. During the speech, I was called into a private room and was given a pressure sales pitch to purchase classes that was very expensive. I told the sales person that I could not afford them. The sales person said,  "let me see if you qualify for a loan." When the sales person came back, "I was told you are all set if you can come up with a specific amount." After speaking with other students in my 3 hour class, I found they got the same sales pitch and qualified for the same loan amount. I took the class twice at the center and took careful notes each time and I have also taken lots of the online classes XLT. I even tried using pro picks (the ticker symbols recommended daily by OTA for trading). Only to find out that the majority of trades stop out for a lost. The strategy does not work and to make matters even worse the center that I paid to attend in my area has shut down. The students that I have spoken with in my area have had the same experience. Please see attachment.Posted by Floyd H.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Update 9/2/20. After my original review was posted, I received a call from Chris Crum, the owner of OTA KC. His voicemail said wanted to discuss my "request for a refund". I responded in writing, stating we needed written communication for both of our interest. No response after 3 weeks. Also, they disabled reviews on their Facebook page so that my review could not be seen there.

As a "Mastermind Student" (top package), I am 100% DISSATISFIED with OTA OF KC, and my "investment" into OTA has been a complete waste of time and money.
1. OTA OF KC Misrepresented the Time Investment Required
2. OTA OF KC Misrepresented Projected Income
3. OTA CORPORATE'S Training "Product" Contains Significant Amount of Conflicts in Training Instruction

1. OTA OF KC frequently cited the following before purchase: "You can set your trades and forget it. You only need a couple of hours each day. Trade anytime day or night. Most students are profitable within six months." The realities are that time investment required is substantial, and OTA trainers refuted these claims in more advanced classes from other areas that stated:
"Setting your trades and not monitoring them is a high risk for loss and not advised. Setting your trades at night and letting them run is foolish. It takes years, many hours of training, and tons of hard work to become a profitable trader. Technically you can place a trade any time of day, but doing so outside of the peak hours of 7 AM to 11 AM M-F is foolish." The few successful traders I have spoken to all have stated that it took 3-5 years to become profitable, after spending 20+ hours each week.  None of my OTA fellow students I have kept in touch with have become profitable after 20 months and substantial time investment. OTA OF KC had foreknowledge about my schedule limitations, yet never provided caution of time needed. Repeatedly, they assured me of flexibility and minimal time investment.

2. OTA OF KC projected income thru a customized "trade plan". Goals, objectives, and projections were all provided by OTA OF KC, based on their calculations. As described above, Schedule limitations were NOT taken into account when accessing "trading risks" within their plan. OTA OF KC failed to disclose "No Entry Trades" during income projections, success rates, or training. OTA's own student accessible "MYOTA" website shows their "Pro Picks" professional trade recommendations from December 27, 2018, till May 27, 2020, are as follows::
558 recommended trades
35 Closed for Break Even
50 Closed for Loss
59 Closed for Profit
414 never made an entry (74%)
No entry trades use margin and limit the number of trades you can place per day, thereby affecting your profitability. Despite "no entry trades," accounting for over 74%, OTA OF KC failed to disclose "no entries" during training, trade plan creation or projected income. This information is not common knowledge by a novice trader. When I asked for help, OTA OF KC and OTA corporate said to "watch more videos".

3. Training materials are not taught consistently between instructors, which causes SIGNIFICANT confusion to students. It is unnecessarily frustrating and leads to students' poor trading results. This problem is common knowledge among OTA staff and trainers.  Drastic and vast differences in training methods require an immeasurable amount of time for a new student to determine correctly. Making OTA's "training product" a disputable "benefit" over other far less expensive trading classes.

All items stated in this review are verifiable. A simple google search into FTC suit against OTA validates these statements and confirms OTA's long-standing practice of buying off bad reviews.

When I requested a refund, they denied it. OTA OF KC cited a three-day clause for "returns". No product this complex or this expensive is possible within that short time-frame. OTA OF KC never saught to resolve my complaints, provide solutions, or even apologize despite spending $48k with their organization. A huge regret that I hope others avoid.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I attended a great futures class this week with Jerry Baldwin. Online Trading Academy is not only a great place to learn to trade a myriad of asset classes, it is a premier training organization period. I've never experienced the degree of support before and after a learning experience. They go out of their way to ensure that students "get it." My impression is that they feel they're successful only when students are successful.<//Text>

After trading for awhile and taking other classes I consider Jerry Baldwin the best instructor I ever had. Jerry teaches a hands on approach through constant repetition of a trading routine. He  creates a very good learning atmosphere  and keeps everybody involved. He is willing to help and will answer all questions. I had an awesome week and enjoyed being a student at OTA.</text>

<text>Having an amazing week this week at the Futures class offered at Online Trading Academy Irvine. Many Many thanks to the wonderful staff for the hospitality and graciousness that they have shown both me and the students all week. The students enthusiasm and participation have made for an exceptional learning environment all week. The live trades being presented from the front of the room and the student's ability to be Hands-On and participate in them has contributed to the great progress each student has made all week. I would strongly encourage this futures class to anyone interested in taking their trading to the next level Jerry:-)<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

"Full package" is promised to have unlimited classes but  its not really true

Jerry Baldwin is phenomenal with his odds enchancers and the way he teaches, I couldn’t wait to get home and practice, practice, practice.

<review>I have been attending the Pro Trading Class at the Trading Academy and I could not be more pleased, impressed and satisfied with the whole package.. My trainer Scot Stokes is possibly one of the best teachers  have ever experienced. He is caring, thorough and really helped me get the big idea of their proprietary system and core strategy. Also the entire support team make you feel like family it is no wonder I saw a plaque from the newspaper declaring online academy being voted best place to work for three years!   I would recommend Online Trading Academy to anyone that seeks to really become a proficient and professional trader.

I can't say enough about the quality of instructors and staff at the OTA Irvine center. They are some of the friendliest and helpful people you can possibly work with. Besides OTA having the best trading education on the planet, the Irvine center makes it more accessible with proper training and support. The education is phenomenal and the small class room setting with one on one support is key to professional growth. They really care about students and are there for every step in their journey to achieve financial success in their trading.<//review>

<review>I had the pleasure of teaching an amazing class of new Core Strategy Students. I was amazed by their passion and dedication to learn how to trade like a professional and how quickly they picked up our patent core strategy. They were all putting in trades by the end of the week. In addition, the Center is welcoming and the staff is great. I definitely look forward to teaching in Irvine again in the future.< /review>< response>

This was one thing that really stuck out. They call it risk management. The patented core strategy they teach shows how this is done. You can learn how to trade like the big institutions. The instructors are exceptional. They are very knowledgeable and very patient. They make sure you understand everything taught in the classes. I was able to grasp all the concepts very well. The main headquarters in Irvine has a professional environment, it is very clean, and everyone working there are very nice. They provide a lifetime of knowledge in the trading market. They will always be there for you for life. I highly recommend Online Trading Academy.<//Text>< Pictures>

I've been working with the Online Trading Academy team off and on for a few years now and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive.

The instructors are bright, motivated, and really passionate about the courses they teach. The management team seems to go above and beyond to ensure that students are satisfied with their experience and leave with the tools necessary to become successful traders.

It feels like there is a lot of room for the business to grow and the environment is fast-paced and fun to be a part of.<//Text>

My experience with OTA has simply changed the way I look at my future. I love my day job and have done well but retirement was never really a possibility for me. From the first class in OTA, I knew this was the education and support I needed to gain control of my financial future.

This is not a get rich quick approach. It’s learn, apply, and grow. Then with some time and discipline you will improve your life and your vision of your future. The people that I have met through the program are motivated and enthusiastic like I am, and staying engaged with these people will only have a positive impact on my life.

Thank you to everyone at OTA for walking with me on this path!

I had attended the classes at this place and it is an eye-opening to what I don't know.  It had amazing people and teachers that are knowledgeable and know what they are doing.  I believe that if people that do nothing for themselves will get no where in life.  Check out the place and see what out there for you.< /Review>

<review>Online Trading Academy is a Vault of Information providing a wealth of knowledge! I’m new to trading and have been taught how to trade professionally by recognizing and utilizing the flow pattern of institutional trading. This knowledge is extremely valuable and allows for one to trade with the institutions rather than trading against them. OTA’s strategy has actually worked.  In my first week of trading I made profits by applying the Online Trading Academy core strategy. Also, the company shows belief in you as a student and actually allows you to trade live their dollars during the last couple days of class—Now that’s saying something!
I would highly recommend attending this school to anyone. It’s never too late to learn!!

< Review>
I truly enjoyed and learned a great deal from Online Trading Academy's Options trading class. The instructor, with his depth of knowledge and understanding of Options trading, along with his examples and experiences made for a very productive, and enjoyable learning environment. Most of all, the curriculum, and the added value of practical step by step trade planning and execution made the experience complete. Again, this is my third asset trading class, and again, Online Trading Academy exceeded all my expectations and more. I would highly recommend, to anyone who wants to finally understand and take charge of their financial present and future, check out Online Trading Academy, and the various programs that are available.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Hey Irvine! You have an incredible gem here! I just finished teaching Professional Options Trader and let me tell you, this Center is one of the very best! From the top down, everyone really cares about our fellow traders because that is what you are to us- a fellow trader. Now you have some work to do to become truly successful but who do you want to learn from? People who actually trade profitably or someone who tells you how to trade profitably? OTA is the only educator that let's you learn from actual pros! Is it worth it? Only if you plan on applying yourselves! Want real change in your life? Get in here! Don't wait any more! Learn from the Best! OTA!</review>< pics>

My experience with the Atlanta Online Trading Academy as been exceptional . They have exceeded my expectation.I started out thinking I was paying too much for a trading education but 2 weeks into their program I am convinced that I have paid for the best!
The course content, the resources , and above all the friendly Staff and conducive  learning environment, makes the cost a non-issue. After-all it is a lifetime membership. My coach - Adam Darwish has been very accommodating of all my demands and emphasizing the needed steps. I know I am on the right track!< /review>

<Text>I would just like to that I am enjoying my training at OTA Irvine. The campus is outstanding, the entire staff is friendly, helpful and seems to really enjoy their jobs. It is refreshing to find an organization that under promises and over delivers to it's clients. They prove that their methodology works, in class  on a live platform.  I would do this training again, I should have done this years ago.<//Text>< date>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Took the futures class here and everything was fantastic. I can't wait to start using the strategies Jerry shared with us. The only suggestion I have is for them to put an m&m bin in the kitchen, because there is only a trail mix bin with m&ms in it and I have to go through approximately 2.5 bowls of trail mix in order to get the equivalent of 1 bag of m&ms. And I feel so bad throwing away all of that trail mix each day just to get the m&ms. Clark had to buy me a bag of m&ms each day so that I would stop wasting so much trail mix. In conclusion, get an m&m bin. Am I right, or am I right? Oh, and one more thing-
no jk I'm done.< /review>< pictures>

So far I've taken only the Pro Trader class but my dad and I have just signed up for the Mastermind program. It didn't take a lot of convincing for us to realize this was the real deal and is well-worth the money you invest into this academy. I'll be seeing them again soon for the Forex class and I can't wait for everything the rest of the classes here holds!<//text>

My experience with John O'Donnel over the years, is that he is on target, although I haven't taken the trading classes, I am speaking to the caliber of people  that run this company, first class!

I decided to take a course and at my age, 19 i couldn't be happier with my decision. After taking my first course and coming to the academy with absolutely no prior experience, know i know and understand the markets. Cant wait to continue learning at the academy, highly recommend making that investment in yourself.</Review>

I just returned from teaching the Core Strategy Class in Irvine and I am always blown away by the attention to detail that our Irvine Center provides for our students. As an instructor, it is an incredible place to teach. The classrooms are equipped with the latest technology so from where I stand it's hard to beat. However the student interaction with the student support team led by Erika Carrillo and Kipton Cariaga is what's so impressive. All of this combines for a great student experience. Keep up the great work!< /Text>

Fantastic Professor. A real Wiz! You guys want to learn how to trade on a whole other level, Jerry is the man! His ATR formula and the way to apply it to charts is the move! Not enough can be said about someone who teaches you how to make bookoo bucks in less than 1 hour, LITERALLY!<//Text>

Both instructors were so awesome I’d be hard-pressed to name a favorite.  But all readers should understand it’s more than just the Instructors that make Online Trading Academy (OTA) a great community to belong to.  The online resources available while you’re remote, all the upbeat and helpful staff you interact with in various ways, the classroom facilities setup for hands on learning while you’re onsite and, also the connections you make with fellow students all contribute to make OTA a premier learning experience.  Whether you’re looking for a safe and profitable entry into the big wide world of trading or trying to enhance current trading success, I highly recommend OTA.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>If you want to learn more about Futures, I recommend to take a class from Jerry Baldwin at OTA.  He made Futures topics such as Globex, ATR for 24hrs and Daily charts very easy to understand and a lot of hands-on trading in the class.  I have never seen an instructor that is so excited about the topic that makes us want to learn more and more.  Thanks Jerry for an awesome week learning about Futures trading.

I've worked at Online Trading Academy now for well over 8 years. I see students everyday and visit with them to understand their experience and how we can improve our services. Their feedback is always complimentary, appreciative and thoughtful. Maybe I'm biased, but I would not be writing this if I was not passionate about our company, my fellow employees and the leadership in this company. Not only is it a great place to work as demonstrated in three recent workplace surveys by the OC Register awarding us one of the Top Workplaces in the OC, , but it is also a great place to learn for anyone wanting to understand and act on their financial future.< /text>

Coming from someone who knew nothing about stocks etc., this place has given me so much knowledge about the trade.  The people are wonderful the staff and the instructors are very knowledgeable coming from their own ups and downs in life.  They have motivated me to pursue and continue to learn. Now, I know I'll have another source of income especially that my daughter will be in college soon. So far,  I have 2 instructors to thank, Stephen Hanahoe and Jerry Baldwin and of course to the entire staff of OTA Irvine  especially to Marjan who really made it easy for us to decide to enroll.  Thank you all.
Jerry your "Future" class keeps me awake. Not a moment i felt sleepy or bored especially coming from night shift. Learned  a lot this week. Highly revomended.👍< /Review>

If you're serious about learning how to trade, this is the place to be.

After High school I went to college for a couple years, racking up about $30,000 in school loans and I had learned two things:

1) I wanted to learn how to trade

2) Arguing with my economics professor on the direction of the Market wasn't the way to do it

I came to OTA and have spent about $20k on education here. I'm leaving with the ability to read price action, identify high quality trades with great profit-potential and very low risk. As well as how the Futures markets work, where/when to trade them, how to take advantage of the Globex sessions etc.

Stephen's Core Strategy class was awesome, of course. Stephen you're baller af and we're going to a Pub when I start making money 😉

Jerry's Futures class got me so excited to start trading I didn't even want to go to class the last day... just kidding Jerry! 😂 he made numerous live trades in front of us, proving the effectiveness of the strategies he was teaching. This was the coolest part since you can see what a professional trader does when he actually trades live.

If you're skeptical of this place, it's understandable, I was too. But now I've seen the value and I want to take every class I can.

And I'll fund my education using the strategies Jerry taught us. Then, when I'm a millionaire in like 6 months, you'll have your proof 😂

Thank you OTA!
And you too Marjan 😁<//text>

For beginners, I am not associated with OTA (Online Trading Academy), nor its administration, and I am not providing this review as part of a promotional reimbursement.
My experience with OTA, its staff and instructors, has been very positive, even though I have taken classes for only two months.
My motivation for selecting OTA to lead me through the myriad paths of investing in the financial markets is multi-faceted :
1) I have a desire to proactively control how my hard-earned money is used for my retirement.
2) I have a desire to alter my old career paths into a more rewarding, and more profitable direction.
3) I need help understanding how to apply the financial resources available to me to achieve my goals.
4) I want professional, experienced, and enthusiastic guidance for embarking on my new career path, and to support me down the road when I need it.
5) I want results sooner, not later, to allow me the time to enjoy the results of my effort.
Guess what ?  OTA meets all of my requirements.  After researching my many possibilities for the best method of reaching my goals, I decided on OTA.  From the sales personnel, to the educational counselors, instructors, support staff, and administrative personnel, all the way down to the actual campus facility and its accommodations, there was never a doubt that I made the right decision.
Attending the OTA training is like going back to college to learn a new profession.  Sure it is hard work, time-consuming, and not inexpensive.  But that means that achieving my goals will be worth every investment I make - professionally and financially.  To the reviewers who complain about the cost of this education, I would ask that if you value the quality of your training, at what price would you "book your order to buy" ?  And the parallel to the old adage that "you get what you pay for", is that "you DON'T get what you DON'T pay for".
My appreciation goes to all OTA personnel, and especially my instructors - Steve Hanahoe (Core Strategy), Tim Blotzer (Options), and Jerry Baldwin (Futures), and my education counselor Andy Dominguez.
One of my favorite pieces of advice from the OTA crew is "What you do now will secure your financial success for the rest of your life" - words I intend to live by.</text></record>

All I can say is "wow"!  I've worked with Online Trading Academy on the corporate side for over 4 years, and just took my first class at Irvine center. Why did I wait so long?  Lack of time, not sure I needed to learn to trade, etc.  I so wish I had started sooner!  I have always heard our students rave about the classes, but experiencing it first hand was a real eye opening experience for me.  I didn't expect to fall in love with it, but I did and I've already signed up for my next class!  If you're thinking about taking a class, just do it.  Take it from someone who spent 4 years making excuses and can't be happier that I finally ran out of them.< /review>

<Review>I just competed the Options class of 10/2/17.  Previously I completed Core strategy and Forex classes.  OTA provided good environment, nice and clean facility.  The staff were friendly, the student support agent was helpful, the counselors were professional and the instructors were knowledgeable.  If you wanted to learn the technique and knowledge about investment, OTA is the best choice.

There is a right way to trade and there is the way everyone else does it.  Over 90% of people lose money trading.  I was one of them.  Wall Street never loses (big financial institutions).   This school and its program teaches you how to join the big wall street banks in making money.   Its not a gambling strategy, its not a gimmick or 'market trick', nor an indicator technique, its just an established and verified process - a series of steps and teachings = Education.   2 years I spent buying into 'tips' and 'strategies' for trading via internet and 'seminars' and gained nothing.   15 years I've spent being an entrepreneur.   And yet, it isn't until  going through OTA's program and classes that I REALLY perceive my financial freedom.

Without reservation I can say Online Trading Academy is the top school for trading, with the most intelligent core program, a very nice campus design, dynamic instructors.. which makes this absolutely the best investment in yourself.  Thank you to the support staff here as they have made me realize my full potential for wealth and legacy.   I  highly recommend this school.  I have (5) children and would trust any of them to attend this school - in fact, it's now part of their architectural, engineering, firefighter, writer, veterinarian education plan.

Shouts outs:  Andy Dominguez for believing in me and giving me the opportunity.  Darren Kimoto, for relating and inspiring me, Erika Carrillo, for the support and patience, Larry Jacobson, for the guidance and teaching style, and for showing me the 'right way'.  Here I thought l was good.... I'm looking forward to being great.< /Text>

Last Friday, Jeanne Sadler and I completed a 7 day ProTrader course at the Irvine OTA office. Our first experience with OTA was in September when we attended a 3 Day Introductory seminar. I could write and entire book about the positive experiences we have had with the OTA classes and especially the staff. Our instructiors, Darren Kimoto and Kelly Boycks, were some of the best. They opened up a whole new way of thinking for both of us. The support options offered by OTA have exceeded my expectations. The concern and help given us from our OTA support team, Erika Carrillo and Andy Dominguez has been great. Jeanne and I both look forward to continuing to learn with OTA!< /Text>

< Review>
I first attended OTA as a newbie in August and over the first three days was floored by the mass of knowledge nestled in the folds of Irvine's metropolis- knowledge that many if not all of my peers knew nothing of. I was back again in September for the ProTrader class and once again  was impressed by the professional expertise of the instructors and staff, but also the down to earth amicability that warms the otherwise A/Ced building.
Just yesterday I finished the ForEx class and now my head is full of invaluable information regarding HOW and WHY the markets work as they do.
Being the fresh outta high-schooler that I am, it was a thought provoking experience to be seated for days at a time by people who are a good ten, twenty, even fifty years older than me! The classes taught at OTA are really for anyone of any age so long as they have the dedication, interest, and learnability to really take in the cascade of knowledge. Every instructor is different- they all have different styles of teaching and trading and they respect that each and every student is an individual with their own mind and their own 'Why'.
OTA gets five stars in my reckoning because in the collective 15 days I've spent in classes their, I've learned about as much in a full semester of *normal* school; for those of you that know Plato's allegory of the Cave, it's like that.< /Review>

I came to take my trading to a higher level. And the trading has improved. But I am most excited about learning more and more the intricacies of the investment/ financial world.
I am very fortunate to have Adam Matisko as my coach. Adam is optimistic, cheerful, bullish and it is contagious. A great listener, he presented me with what OTA had to offer me and worked diligently to define several paths I could take to start my learning journey.
I look forward to every class for i am always greeted by a friendly, nowledgeable staff that cares and energizes me.
I recommend this school to everyone who wants to learn to trade successfully and less stressfully.< /Text>< pics>

My 17-year-old son is very good with money.  He started selling my cookies and brownies at school when he was 12, unbeknownst to me, and continually saved the money in a drawer.  I discovered it when he was 15, asked him about the stack of cash, and realized that my boy had a really good head on his shoulders.  I wanted to encourage him to use his piggy-bank wisely and all of the future income that he will make, so I looked into different programs that would teach him about economics, the stock market, making money.  He and I went to several presentations offered by a variety of investment "schools" or money-making programs.  The one that we liked the most was OTA.  We felt that it had the most comprehensive program for us to start with.  We liked the idea of becoming MasterMind students and being part of a community of like-minded people who could encourage and mentor us for the rest of our lives - especially my teenage son.
We have attended several of OTA's week-long classes and have learned more than we had imagined.  The instructors are all very different: different personalities and different teaching styles, but their core strategies for trading and doing well in the markets are consistent and reliable as long as you don't deviate from their proven methods.  We don't want to recreate the wheel; we just want to benefit from its creation. The same with OTA: we want to be as successful as all of the teachers and mentors, who are very willing to share the stories of their success and their techniques.  So, we'll do what they teach us to do and become successful ourselves.
We are beginning to trade "live," after gaining some valuable practice from the simulated account.  The income potential is huge and we love being part of a global billion dollar industry that changes constantly. The freedom and flexibility that trading will provide for us is what I have been looking for for years. I'm leaving my 24-year legal career to do something really exciting and fun!  As for my son, he is going away to college in the fall.  People have asked us, "Why does he even need to go to school?  He's going to be really successful at trading!"  It's up to him what he wants to do -- and it's up to you to take charge of your life too.  This could be the key to your future.  I know it is for him, and it is for me.<//Review>

I want to thank OTA and the instructors that I had the opportunity to meet so far, for sharing their knowledge  and experience with us. honestly I did not know at the beginning when I joined the Academy what to expect, but what I have experienced last week in class, was amazing and beyond my expectations.
Although my first asset-class I'll be taking is Forex, the foundation and the way of analyzing charts I learned are key for everything in trading all the markets.
I'm looking forward to continuing my education and growth with the great help and experience that OTA has to offer.
Honestly, I invite everyone who wants to become a professional trader, to join OTA and learn it the right way.
Good luck,

Don't bother. Go to oil oil Rite Express Lube on Sierra Highway in Lancaster. I should have read these reviews also. It used to be a nice small town place. Now it is gone corporate, cold, and inflexible. I wanted to drive my car into the bay. They told me it is now corporate policy that no customer is allowed to drive into the bay. I told them that if they wouldn't let me drive in, I would drive away and take my business elsewhere. They said no, but suggested I take my Jiffy Lube business to the one at the Walmart. That sounds like a different establishment might allow you to drive in. I did better than that. I went to Oil Rite Express Lube on Sierra Highway in Lancaster. I pulled in. $46. I was done in 10 minutes. I was easily a 10-year Jiffy Lube customer. But I'm done.<//review>

<review>The equipment is not maintain the service is selective and the work is shoddy be very careful I've seen it with my own eyes beware take the drive to Lancaster or down below or to a dealer they'll have all the tools and won't be any excuses like the computers down or the compressor is out or we don't have the right socket that's frustrating< /review>< pics>

Requested oil change only, nothing else. They did exactly as I requested. I was taken in immediately because there was no other cars there. No complaints</text>

I brought in my new car for an oil change and was asked how I liked it. I feel like they are interested in getting to know their customers which is something I value.

I just stop by today around 1:20 pm. The employees don't want to make the oil change because they was in lunch,  my questions is all the employees have to take the lunch in the same time? The customers have to wait over 45 minutes to they start the oil change? In my opinion they have to be more organized....< /Text>

The younger staff are polite and helpful and have always treated us well,but at this point I am willing to pay more not to deal with someone that does not want our business nor money/ No we are not kids ourselves at 64 years of age.<//Review>< username>

<Review>I had to wait 45 minutes for an oil change. Nester said that's how long it takes. However when they did mine it only took 10 minutes and the compressor broke down. I didn't get all of the services nor the same service the previous customer did.  Wow this is how you pick and choose how to treat your customers. And to think I'm MILATARY . DAMN WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION TO ANYONE</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I'm not coming back for an oil change since it is now policy (to pay more) to have a crumby vacuum  job and windows cleaned-nearly $50 to change oil in small 4 cylinder car.
Very Sorry to see this happen.
Not worth it.<//Text></record>

If there was an option to leave negitvie stars I would. Took my car for an oil change in Lancaster and found out this shop didn't change my oil filter the last two times I had service there. Would not trust my car here as the manager did nothing but blame me.<//text>

I explained that I can't drive around to a mechanic without oil in truck. Really bad policy practice. Shame on jiffy lube. But the employees there were understanding
And topped my oil off at no charge. Very nice guy that helped me out. Without his kindness. I would have probably had worse problem to fix. To that employee I thank you. But to jiffy lube. Policy. Bad</text>< pictures>

Jim really made our night with his suggestions. Greeted us with a Clementine, helped us with a sable fish selection and a great wine pairing... Before we could leave though we had to grab some Buffalo mozzarella.<//review>

<text>After many trips regretting that I could not stop and check this farm stand out, last Saturday I took the SFD route back from Point Reyes. I was hungry, particularly after seeing their fresh display. The freshest argula, cherry tomatoes, and beautifully formed butter 🥬. They also have cerviche, cioppino, salmon, scallops, and more. A bit pricey but I'm totally satisfied and satiated.</text>< date>

My review is for Pump Espresso (right next door in the same building). Lovely coffee and one of the best coconut London Fogs I've ever had! Friendly service and yummy hommade marshmallows to boot 🥰< /Review>

The produce and dairy is very good, as most of it is from around the area. The meat is also outstanding. They have remained open, even during this pandemic, but with social distancing measures in place. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone who is in the area to stop by.< /Text>< pics>

They have a great seasonal selection of fruits and veggies. And their seafood is always on point -- oysters, smoked salmon. We've also gotten honey, beer, cider, and eggs here. Everything we get from Jim is fantastic and we always learn a little bit about how things are grown, what's in season, what's coming up, etc. During this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are masked and socially distant. We always feel safe. A true asset to the area and an awesome way to stock your kitchen with local and seasonal goods.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The Farm Stand has been a life saver during this quarantine time.  Jim has arranged the Farm Stand to create a safe space which allows us to get the fresh vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, dairy goods and so much more safely.  My family is forever indebted to him and his staff for sacrificing themselves for our sake.  The produce, as well as all the other goods, are locally sourced thereby helping our neighbors who keep us well fed.  My family will continue to support Jim and enjoy all the high quality goods he sells.<//review>

<review>The Farm Stand is a world changing market that makes a difference. With its emphasis on locally sourced, top shelf ingredients, this little gem of a market reminds us all what really matters. From seasonal fruits and vegetables to the highest quality seafood, meat and dairy, The Farm Stand has everything one needs to satiate and promote a healthful and delicious lifestyle. Jim Baum is an owner who’s charisma, integrity, and care for his products and customers is just icing on the cake. A remarkable personality, and a phenomenal business vanguard of California’s grassroots food movement.< /review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Wonderful community oriented place to get locally sourced fruits and veggies, plus fish, shrimp, pork, lamb,if so inclined.  Everything I have ever bought there has been ripe and ready to eat.  In this time of Covid19 Jim is being especially careful.  I like that other shoppers are not touching the produce.  Plus the drive out there is so beautiful.  If you have to wait in line, enjoy it- listen for woodpeckers and red tail hawks.</Review>

<review>I love this place! They always have local fresh produce at a reasonable price.  I highly recommend using Farm Stand cause they are concerned about covid and trying to be safe.

Thanks Jim! See y'all soon!</review>< pics>

Oh my goodness, what a GEM this place is! The local meat selection is beautiful and so fresh, the organic produce is delicious, and Jim’s enthusiastic and friendly hospitality makes you feel right at home. We also had the most delicious salmon poke we’ve ever eaten. We can’t wait to come back and visit again!</text>

If you want the *best* produce, the *best* meat + fish, and the *best* service, then you *best* come to this place! I am so lucky it's just a mile away! Who needs anything else? Jim and his crew are literally the sweetest I know, and his cooking tips are tops.< /Review>

If I could give Jim and his stand 10 stars, I would. Not only did take the time to walk us through his local and fresh selection, but he let us sample it! Fresh oysters, peaches, melons, carrots! Not to mention, Jim really knows his stuff and helped draw attention to flavors and textures I’ve never noticed.

If you’re passing through the area, definitely stop by. It will make your day (and your taste buds) so happy.</Text>

<Text>We stopped by today on our way back from hiking and bought meat & produce.  Jim heard we were vacationing from Louisiana and graciously let us sample his fruits while recommending vegetables paired with our meat.  He even posed with our family for a vacation photo! Highly recommend this business!<//Text><Date>1560730431224</Date>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Jim and the others are amazing. Now, during the pandemic, they are perfectly suited for the job. You wait in line outdoors---I've gone usually between 2 pm and 5 pm and there have never been more than 2 or 3 people ahead of me---order your fruit and veggies which are on display behind a roped off area. The attendant puts them in a basket and sets them aside. Then you use your phone to call the other attendant who's inside the store and order from the menu of items on a whiteboard you can peruse while waiting.  Items include very fresh fish and meats and cheeses.  Almost everything is made by local artisans...primarily in West Marin. They have fresh Ramini Mozzarella di bufala.  I've lived most of the last 30 years in Italy and this is the ONLY mozzarella I've found that tastes like mozzarella...buonissima.  From Edmund< /Review>

Great people giving great service.

If they are open, I stop and grab a coffee at least.  Great pastries, curios, gifts and a wonderful fruit stand next door.  If in your way to a day in the local parks, this is where you start to be on a day off.<//review>

My friend and I just finished a hike and stopped by the Farm Stand for a few quick nibbles. We ended up staying much longer than anticipated because we were having so much fun talking to Jim and trying his DELICIOUS food. He has the highest quality food and it's clear that he takes so much pride in providing to the community and those that stop by. Thank you Jim for your generosity and hospitality! Can't wait to stop by again soon.< /text>

We just found a new treasure. Jim opened our minds and taste buds to what kale tastes like. Tangerines, carrots and broccoli never sparkled and glittered like this. Hello vegetables, we are friends again. Thanks Jim. 🍊🥬🥕< /text>

<Text>A gem of a resource for the community. Excellent, 100% organic farm produce, much of it truly local. The owner is a friendly man who cares a ton about what he sells. Prices are high compared to some other North Bay farm stands, but this is a wonderful alternative to driving down into the big town of Fairfax to shop at The Good Earth, if you don't feel like dealing with traffic and live in Lagunitas, Olema, Woodacre, Nicasio, etc.

Open year-round and well worth a visit. Adds to Marin's local food security in a very important way.</Text>< resp>

I had my first ever Brazilian and Underarm wax. My waxer was Kayla and even though I was very nervous because I heard about first time waxing being very painful(especially Brazilian), I was very comfortable and the experience was not as bad as I initially assumed it would be.</text>

This was my very First time in getting a full-girl wax and when I tell you I laughed mired than anything, I did.

I absolutely love Angel. She makes you feel so comfortable at such an awkward setting. She talks to you during it and lets you know what she's doing and when she's doing it. She's such a personable person and just amazing and her job. I only go there if I get Angel as my waxer. Highly recommend this place.<//text>

I’ve never gotten waxed before but I am so glad I chose Lunchbox Wax for my first! I got waxed by Ashley, who did a great job waxing me! Also, I appreciated how she made this nerve racking experience more relaxing by talking to me the whole time. It definitely made me feel more comfortable and distracted! Thanks Ashley!!! And thank you Lunchbox Wax!!<//Text>

I had Chelsea do my brows! She did an amazing job. She perfected every detail of my brows, always making sure I was pleased with the result. The hair removal didn’t hurt that bad either, I found it pretty relaxing actually. The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I definitely recommend Lunch Box Wax!<//review>

The staff was very nice. However the wax job itself was horrible. I had to go get redone some where else. Wont be returning here. I always prefer European Wax. They are just as professional but the wax jobs are the best!!< /text>

<Review>I just got waxed by Rhiannon and she is fabulously! By far the least painful waxing I have ever had, I didn't cuss once! Plus, she is a pleasure to talk to made me feel so comfortable and relaxed. I plan on going to see her in two days for other waxings I need done. I highly recommend Rhiannon for sensitive waxing or any waxing you want done.</Review><rating>5< /rating>< GmapID>

Sandy has been my waxer for about a year now.  She is amazing at what she does and she’s pretty much the only one I trust with my waxing needs.  I have tried many wax places, but the customer service at this location, from the minute you walk in the door til you walk out, is incredible!  I highly recommend lunchbox wax!</Review>

I had Maddie as my waxer and I really liked her! I got a bikini and underarm wax. She did the underarms first and it kind of hurt so I was nervous for her to do my bikini line but surprisingly, the bikini line hurt less! If I go back to Lunchbox I’ll definitely ask for Maddie again.< /Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>The service was professional and appropriate from the beginning which I was pleased about considering this was my first time not only @ lunchbox but getting waxed in general. I am giving the low rating for the wax job in general. When I got home, i noticed patches of hair on my lower legs as well as many missed hairs from my Brazilian. I have to say, there is nothing more frustrating then spending the amount of money that I did for an incomplete job.< /Text>< rating>

This was my first visit at Lunchbox. I was greeted promptly and taken into my room right after I filled out my first- time visit form. The facility is nice and clean. Kiarah did a great job and made me feel comfortable. She was very professional and answered my questions. I will definitely recommend to my friends and family.</Review>

From setting up my appt over the phone with this sweet guy who understand I had a comfort zone I wanted to stay in, to the gal who greeted me at the front desk and of course my waxologist. Kelsie was FKNNNN AMAZING. She understood all my concerns, she could relate to a lot of them so this eased my mind, she engaged in a great conversation and was just this totally positive, upbeat and kickass chic. I deff.. will be coming back to see her and on a regular basis. Thanks girl!</text><user_id>115404920104686625787</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Amazing!!! I’ve been to other places and they don’t  compare. My waxologist was Alexia and she was super informative and made the whole wax process super comfortable(I got a Brazilian). I brought a friend who waited in the lobby and she said she could hear us laughing from our room. I am officially a forever lunchbox client. Thank you Alexia!!!! Highly recommend to EVERYONE.</review>

<rate>2< /rate><review>This was my first visit and I’m not sure I’ll ever go back. After a text and voicemail confirming an 8:30am appointment I was very unhappy to find the doors locked and nobody at the facility at 8:30. It wasn’t until after 8:45 that someone arrived, not expecting me to be there. After she was situated I was taken to a room. Undressed, prepped and ready for my wax I was informed we would need to move to a different room because the wax was hard as a rock. So I got dressed, moved to a new room and started the process all over. The waxing did not go well, as I left with a lot of hair still. It had a 10-14 day growth and I should not have left with so much hair. I was still charged full price. I could tell that the esthetician was frazzled and trying her best to make things work out but it just didn’t go well at all. I was very dissatisfied with my experience. I would have given 1 star but I could tell Rebecca was frazzled, felt awful, and doing her best. She was pleasant and nice.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Sandy is a really great. She makes you feel comfortable and does a through job. I had never had a Brazilian wax before and she walked me through it and now I get it done on a regular basis.  I usually have to remind her that the wax is too hot for my really sensitive skin but other than that I've had no other issues.< /Text>

I got a Brazilian and it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The lady that helped me, Alexia, put pressure on the area she waxed so that it wouldn't sting as much as it would have if she had left the area exposed. She also told me when to breathe during the more sensitive areas and talked me through the process so I knew what was going on which made me feel more comfortable.<//Review>

This was my first time EVER getting waxed and it was a great experience. Maria was so nice and she waxed my bikini and full legs and made sure I was comfortable the whole time! I had a little bit of wax left on my legs but nothing I couldn't clean up quickly at home. This is a great place to get a nice clean wax<//Review>

I have been to Lunchbox Wax 3 times now and the 1st time I entered the building I have to admit I was very scared because I had no idea what to expect. However all it took was a greeting from the friendly staff and reassurance from the technician and my mind was instantly put at ease. Subsequently, my experience has been amazing and I highly recommend this place. Very professional.< /review>

<Text>Had a wonderful experience at Lunchbox Wax in Brentwood. Chelsea was friendly and professional, she explained everything from the product she was using and through the process. I had my eyebrows, lip, and Brazilian. The employee's were nice and I did not have to wait long, was offered water while I filled out paperwork. Will be back and highly recommend.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I can honestly say that I was pretty hesitant to go somewhere to get my eyebrows done because well let's be real people judge, not that I really care about what other people think but it's actually a comfortable environment for a guy to go into and receive their services. The girls there are all really great amd I will continue going there every 6 weeks until I no longer live in the area. Thanks girls!!!

P.S. I just left there and the regular girl that I see has moved since my last appointment and i got scheduled with Ashley, she did a great job.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1547755681381, 'text': 'Thank you Billy for your feedback, we look forward to having you back!'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808ff8decbc95c4f:0xc0871ec043aea940<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>I get waxed by Alexia. The service I get here at LunchBoxWax is a full Brazilian. The first time I came I was nervous because it’s new, someone is going to be down there, and hey it’s going to be painful who else wouldn’t be nervous. Alexia made me feel very comfortable. I told her it was my first time and she made me feel really good she walked me through everything and she was so amazing!!! After you get through that first time it’s a breeze. I love Alexia. She keeps you distracted focusing on other topics vs the hair being pulled out. Alexia is the go to girl!

It was my first time going there and my experience was beyond what I anticipated. The lady was very gentle and she was always asking if I was alright which made me feel really taken care of. And I love the promotion about getting the second wax on them.<//Text>

After getting a Brazilian wax for the last 6 years I thought I have experienced it all. I was wrong. After seeing Chelsea for my latest wax my standards have been raised! I have never had such an easy wax before! Her technique was superb and the products are amazing. I will absolutely be making her my new regular waxologist!</review>

<Text>I had came in to get my legs waxed which is a first of course because I am a man BUT the experience was amazing. While Alexia is training I could not tell she was at all. She kept asking me if I was doing okay and if the pain wasn’t too bad which was nice as some spots were more tender (thighs). She went over the curing process which is 24hrs without sweating or anything like that since the pores are open and sensitive. I would highly recommend Alexia and LunchboxWax as a company to have any other services done if needed. The team is very kind and professional when it comes down to business. Thanks lunchbox and Alexia for making my legs silky smooth :)</Text>< Pics>

I had no idea what to expect, as this was my first wax. However, my technician made it as relaxing as possible.</Text>

Great atmosphere and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. My teenage daughter and I were very pleased. Prices are very reasonable (you can pay roughly 20 a month for brow waxing whenever you need it!). The place is very clean and easily accessible at the Streets of Brentwood. My esthetician Alexia, was awesome and I am greatful to  have found someone I can trust my brows to.< /text>

It was amazing I've been getting waxed for about 7 or 8 years . This was the very best I've ever had . The woman was very soft and very smart as far as waxing . A+ in my book and over 20$ less then anywhere else<//Review>

The atmosphere is very nice and clean. The rooms are clean and always ready when you come in. Alexia has been the person I’ve gone to both times.  I’m able to have a conversation with her and I personally feel comfortable with her. I would recommend this place if someone wanted to get waxed. Especially for brazilians. Just make sure you grow out your hair long enough. It varies from
2 weeks to 4 weeks, just depends how long it takes for your hair to grow out!</review><user_id>103422217262350641991</user_id>< Name>

Rebecca T was awesome! This was my first time getting a wax at this place, so I was very nervous. Rebecca was very nice and knowledgeable. She explained the whole process and as we went through it she answered all of my questions. I booked my next appointment and I can’t imagine going somewhere else now.< /Review>

<text>The services I received today were waxing under arms , eyebrows  and bikini
I haven't gotten waxed at all this year because I've been so busy and it didn't even hurt one bit.
TANAE  is not only an expert at what she does but she was very kind warm friendly and patient.
i've been to numerous waxing places but I would highly recommend lunchbox waxing .
You would not be disappointed !!!< /text>< Pics>

I was pretty disappointed.

Originally I was excited to find a place close by that I could go to during a lunch break. Well they have a fancy scheduling system but I don’t know why. The gal my appointment was with was running late and didn't take me until 10 mins after my appointment start time. Then half way though my session someone comes and asks her to come help with something. I had to wait 5 mins for them to go do what ever the other tech needed help with. If that wasn't enough I had gobs of wax in my hair/side of my head. I would not recommend this place unless they get there act together and show a little professionalism.

One very disappoint client.< /Text>

< Review>
Rebecca was great. Super professional and quick. Very informative and definitely returning!!

New review: June 2019 - hard to find someone consistent. Left this review for rebecca, she left. Another person I liked after her, she left too. Had a bunch of different ppl and some do a great job while others not so much. Nicole did a fantastic job this last time, but not holding hope she will stay on...so far, 2 of my best waxers left. I will be looking for a mom and pop waxing place, this place is way over priced for a full Brazilian. $62 + tip at over $70 every 4-5 weeks is too much. And when the staff varies so much, will look for another spot.< /Review>

<Review>So I had Tanae as my Waxer and she was amazing would recommend her and definitely go back to her, she is super friendly and well trained.
My daughter had an appointment too and had Maggie and she was super DISAPPOINTED with her and it was her first time getting waxed  and stated she will never do that again so I’m sorry but I would have to not recommend her who they should see there. I’m frustrated that my daughter had a bad experience.</Review><UserId.>100305171127655287976< /UserId.>< pictures>

<user_name>Marcy Tegtmeier<//user_name><review>First time visit. Tanae worked on me, she was fabulous. Made me very comfortable for my Brazilian. I would give them five stars but the prices are a bit high. But they are everywhere you go for this service.  I will be back as I appreciate her attention to detail and the place is spotless.

Still living this place. Unfortunate that turnover on waxers is high. I’m on my fifth waxed but maddi b. Is amazing. She is super quick and thorough</review>< Date>

Amazing experience here, Sandy was my aesthetician and was the upmost professional.  I am a European wax convert,  won't go anywhere else. Better atmosphere,  better experience,  their wax is better than European wax center too.GO YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!<//review>

This is definitely the best place to get a brazillian wax in the area (and the best place i've ever been to tbh.) The staff is super friendly, the prices are reasonable and the products they use (soft wax vs. hard wax) are much better on the skin.< /Review>

Chelsea is such a sweetheart! She made me feel super comfortable and was very thorough/clean. She held up a great conversation too!

Loved Chelsea and the vibes at LunchBox!

I'll definitely continue to refer my friends to this place.

We also offer a BOGO free deal for all new guests. We try very hard to remain on schedule and be accommodating, but unfortunately sometimes things happen that are out of our control which can put us behind. We are very sorry that you had to wait past your appointment time, and would love a chance to make things right! If you call our salon directly, we can get you in touch with our manager who can take care of you. We appreciate any opportunity to make things right. Thank you.'}</Response>
