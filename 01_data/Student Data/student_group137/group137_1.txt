Really excellent place to enjoy good food, drink, and service. I enjoyed a solid selection of craft beer. The burger was great and my wife loved the wings. The kids meals were solid portions and my children really enjoyed them. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and the service was solid. On a side note, I enjoy great ranch ranch dressing and theirs is probably the best I've ever had. We enjoyed it so much we came back the next day for more.<//text>

<review>Papa’s House is a “must”place to eat. Great food! I try a new dish every time I go there & I like them all. My favorite is the “Classic Western”. Stallion Springs is a great community & now has more great food. It’s nice to see the new owners excited about food & their future in Stallion. They are friendly & so is the staff. Try a piece of lemon cake. Yum! Plus I hear Papa’s delivers.<//review><username>wade d< /username><rating>5</rating><gmapID>0x80c1ffbae2279c55:0x7a3c439b18a89a4b</gmapID><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHtyGwfOjLs_N6B3jXGXd837uf8D1toMdHaHK5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I've gone to a lot of buffets & admittedly, I over-did-it here.
Everything was fresh and well-cooked for dinner and I am planning my next visit.
The dessert bar was the most memorable and the whole roasted pig was the least memorable.< /Review>

Papa's House is a landmark in Stallion Springs. The new owners carry on the tradition of making and serving the best food possible! The menu has a little something for everyone, they also take care of those with dietary issues often times going out of their way to create something to suit your needs!  The staff is welcoming and create that small town feel where everyone is family! Great service, always with a smile even when you drop in at the end of the day and they are about to close exhausted and ready to go home to their families you become their family in that moment!  Highly recommended taking a trip out to the Springs to check it out you won't be disappointed!< /Review>

<Review>Absolutely fantastic pizza. The dough is perfectly cooked and they do not skimp on toppings. This place has the best wings in all of tehachapi. I've always been against pineapple on pizza but this place has changed my opinion. Excellent service definitely recommending.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>We tried Papa’s Pizza for the first time tonight... and it was AMAZING!  The hubby & kids had pizza, & they can’t stop talking about how delicious it was!! Although they were out of fish & chips,  I had the (recommend) shrimp salad & pleasantly surprised. Being new to Stallion Springs & not knowing anyone, they treated us like family ❤️ They even knew most of the customers by first name & everyone was so nice. 😊  Awesome experience, minus the crying 4 year old (mine) & a MUST to eat at again!<//review><GmapID>0x80c1ffbae2279c55:0x7a3c439b18a89a4b<//GmapID><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

<review>The worst reuben sandwich I have eaten in 69 years. No thousand island dressing and could not chew the meat.
The french fries were only cooked once. Should have been fried twice so they weren't cold and greasy.
WAY OVER PRICED.
We will not be returning.</review>< rate>

The best part about my experience here is the service. We had two great servers--one taking over for the other probably due to a shift change. The food prices seem took be quite high for the options and quality, but there is not that many choices in this immediate area so they may be able to justify it.</Text>

Burgers are great . The wife especially likes the fried green beans. Onion rings also keep us coming back. Service is just as good as the food.<//review>

<Text>Small cozy AWESOME... 10 tables in the place. Can't get more small town feel than this..according to the attentive staff here this is a seventy (70%) scratch kitchen. 70% !!!!!
Great people of Tehachapi and beyond note this..almost no business runs a 70 % scratch establishment any more.
Our server Katie. Was FANTABOULOUS . Menu knowledge is great. If you are a local check this gem out. If you are visiting make the people you are staying with out here take you here.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>in 2011 and 2012 pizza was very good.  I tried it once in 2013 and it was bad, did not taste like pizza but like really funky kind of cheese.  I decided to give it another try yesterday and again, it was not good.  My daughter or her friend would not eat it.  Wasted money.</review><name>Toxen</name>< userid>

<Name>Rick Spurlock< /Name><rate>5</rate><Review>We moved to Southern California about a year ago and one of the our best discoveries was Leucadia’s. We ordered from here nearly weekly to satisfy our pizza fix but it’s so much more than that. I say this with no hesitation; every single thing we’ve ordered from this menu has been excellent. Not just good, excellent. Appetizers, soups, salads, pastas, desserts, and absolutely the best cauliflower crust pizza we’ve ever found. We have ordered and tried every specialty pizza they offer and they made it very hard to settle on favorites but the Roasted Garlic Shrimp, the Greek, and Deluxe with broccoli were our mainstays. Priced affordably, in fact I don’t know how they aren’t losing money on the Lobster Pizza with the amount of tail meat they put on it. Delivered by the store with exceptional courtesy and no contact options. A rewards program that quickly gives you money off your future orders. Online ordering. Need I gush more?

We always ordered from the Carlsbad location and I should have done this review a year ago because they deserve people knowing what a fantastic job they’ve been doing throughout the entirety of this Covid pandemic. Sadly, we have moved north closer to LA and are now out of delivery range but I assure you, when we travel down towards San Diego next, I hope you’ve got outdoor seating so we can enjoy some favorites again.

P.S. if you’re thinking about expanding in the future, Irvine’s nice. Just sayin’.

P.P.S any chance you could tell me where you get those cauliflower crusts?< /Review><response>None</response>< date>

Leucadia Carlsbad is our go to place for catering and family meals. Dougie and the staff are friendly and professional. Pizza and spaghetti are crowd pleasers. Margherita pizza is always the first to disappear, followed by combo, the tomato bisque soup fabulous. Bologonese and meatballs always a hit. Thank you for the pleasing Italian experience every time!</Review>

I get the price of meat has gone up so $10.50 a Sandwich I get, but using less meat as well is robbery. I haven't been back in like 4 months because of another instance, so I thought let's give it a shot. I'll give ya one more shot then its strike three and you're out. Bummer< /review>

We ordered simple for the kids and more gourmet for us. The pizza and salad were easy to find non-traditional vegetarian options and were very good. Not cheap in price or quality.

The girl who was on the phone help me by handing me my pizza I had told her I had Branch with it she gave me one I had asked if I could have two from the driver and I offered to pay for it he said no I'll just give them to you. When I told her what the driver said she paid no attention and charged me for the extra Ranch she didn't even give me peppers or Parmesan cheese or plates. This is what I usually get offered or it's already in a bag but she did not want to give me these things. I don't know what her problem was but her attitude sucked and if I have been the manager and saw that I would of fired her on the spot! I gave the kitty of pizza the lowest rating tonight and it deserved it. I can't hardly wait to see the owner so I can tell him and give him a piece of my mind. I will never buy a pizza from this place ever again and I suggest to anybody else not support this place because it has no integrity. A big F for failure! 😡😠<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We ordered a gluten free pizza with sausage and onions for dinner.  We were amazed at the flavor and the quality of the crust. Wow
That was a great pizza.<//text>

The only pizza we will eat. We have always received the best service and quality food. I would consider anything else petty and allow the business to make it right, otherwise I would be the loser of terrific food.<//text>

<text>Be wary of the other reviews, the one-stars in particular paint an inaccurate picture due to petty reasons (apparently  a driver forgetting the ranch warrants the worst possible rating).

I've been eager to try this place since it replaced the old (but certainly not gold) Pizza Shuttle that closed down. We got carryout, and I ordered the chicken fingers appetizer. The food arrived fresh and hot in sufficient packaging. I loved the meal I ordered; the chicken was high quality with an authentic style of breading, and I received far more food than I expected for a price of $7.49! I also tried their pepperoni pizza, which was absolutely delicious. A soft dough combined with a crispy crust and a cheese that melted in your mouth yielded an excellent slice. Overall, I would definitely recommend this location for its food quality and excellent prices, and I will certainly order from here again in the future. 👌< /text>< pics>

Perhaps this was because their regular dough/crust was so sweet? (I don't know that I've ever had pizza crust that sugary). The gluten-free crust on the BBQ chicken pizza we ordered was pretty disappointing.<//Text>< response>

Just called to order a pizza and wanted the black olives removed and garlic substituted on a large deluxe pizza, and when asked about the price there was a charge for the garlic addition, but I removed the olives so it should be the same price.  So I canceled the order.  How cheap can a place get?<//Text>

<review>The kids were starving, we ordered our pizza at the beach and we were told that the pizza would arrive in 30 minutes. 40 minutes later, we called and the manager Jill told me that the pizza would be arriving in one minutes, so we waited in the parking lot. After another ten minutes we called again and were told that it would be another ten minutes. After ten more minutes, I called the phone number and again Jill picked up and said "I know, you have been waiting 56 minutes. Your pizza will be there soon!"..then she hung up! Finally the pizza person arrived, we were told that we were the third delivery on  the list. Someone could have told us this instead of lying and repeatedly saying that the pizza would arrive any minute. We will never be ordering from Leucadia Pizza again, thanks to the horrible service and false promises!< /review>< user>

These guys are the best. I've been going to them for nearly 10 years now and they have always figured out what's going on, are honest, and reasonably priced. Highly recommend them.</review>

< Review>
I had the most fun day getting a scooter here! These guys know their stuff, and are not pushy or sales-y. Barry and Diego are awesome dudes who just love scooters. You can tell this place is highly regarded by the scooter community. When it was time to drive my new Buddy home, Barry stayed late and gave me a full lesson on how to ride and get home safely. Can't recommend them enough if you're looking to get started on a scooter in SF.</Review>

Long story short, SF Scooter Centre is honest and unpretentious and I think you will have the same experience if you go there.

I've been going to SF Scooter Centre for years and am really glad to have them for all my Vespa maintenance needs. In comparison, I took my Vespa to Scuderia West recently which was a total mistake. I had an ignition problem due to someone trying to steal my scooter. I towed it to Scuderia. They charge me $160 diagnose my issue. They gave me a work quote for over $1500 to replace my ignition when it wasn't necessary (and they didn't mention that to me). Most of the cost was from the 8hrs of labor they quoted me (they claimed they like to over estimate work hours). I shopped around and got quotes for the same fix for more like 2-3 hours. Scuderia was completely overcharging me. So I took my scooter over to SF Scooter Centre. They were able to resolve my issue for $240. While they could have tried to do all the work the Scuderia West suggested, they nobly told me it wasn't necessary and I got to save $1200.< /review>

<Date>1597650315556< /Date><text>Enjoyed getting the opportunity to buy from Barry and his team at SF Scooter Center. I was able to test drive the make and model I was interested in without an issue. I felt comfortable in the guarantee of high quality service and warranty protections for the Royal Alloy. Overall, glad to see a local SF business providing top of the line customer service.

Plus, very cool to meet the famous Lunchbox - Bulldog mascot

Got my first service done for my vespa here! Same day pickup and even a place to store your helmet. Everyone was lovely especially the pup. Total cost for parts and labor for a first service was $180.< /Review>

Do you go to the shop you always have?
Do you go to the shop that the new scooter was serviced at?
Do you try a new spot?
Is it really that deep?

Diego and the SF Scooter Centre were such a pleasure to work with on getting a new ignition and re-key, I have found my answer. An absolute lovely experience, super knowledgeable without being haughty. As long as the service maintains its excellence, I'm a dedicated client!< /text>< Pictures>

Best place to buy/service a scooter in SF, hands down. Barry and the rest of the crew are beyond helpful, kind, and fast – they've helped me out of multiple jams (scooter getting stolen, top case getting stuck) with the best service. I'll never go anywhere else!< /Review>

A 5 minute phone call with them convinced me that I would never do business with them.

I have an ~8-10 year old buddy scooter.  I lost the key and called to ask if they can help.  The person's I spoke with sounded so put out by my basic  questions that he could hardly even be bothered to waste his breath.  It's possible that i caught the wrong guy on the wrong day but it left such a bad taste in my mouth im not willing to try again..</text>

There's no one else in the world I would trust with my scooter. I have a buddy 170i named "mudblood' who's had a tough year. She was stolen and left for dead in August but Barry had her up and running within a day. A few weeks later my dipstick came loose and I lost all my oil. Barry filled her up free of charge, gave me some good life advice and sent me along my way. If you own a scooter and live in the state of California, this is the only place you should go.< /review>

Oh?!!!
You want to ride a deathtrap?
Actually an electric skateboard is much more portable than these scooters. But it is your own life to risk.
Good luck!</Review>

<review>I've called these guys twice with questions as I shop for a scooter and I gotta say, they've been pretty rude and dismissive. The impression I get is that since I'm not a cool scooter guy and since I'm looking for something more inexpensive, they don't need my business. SF Moto, right around the corner, has the exact opposite attitude; I'm heading there instead.< /review>< pics>

This is the best scooter repair place in the City.   They do a great job at reasonable prices.   They go out of their way to provide excellent customer service.   I have been using them for years and never a problem.   They are honest, reliable and professional.    Also, since they have been working on scooters for decades, they have the expertise and knowledge that pays dividends to their customers.   For example, I had a problem that other places would have charged $800 to fix.   These guys  knew a work around that cost $200.<//text>

Diego was great. Provided excellent service while shopping for a new scooter. As someone completing new to scooting, he was able to offer relevant, expert insights into scooting in San Francisco.</text>

<Text>These guys don't play games and are quick with their turnaround. The two things I want with a repair shop.

I also bought my Genuine Buddy scooter there a few years ago. The sales process was straightforward and I didn't feel like I was taken advantage of. Will be a lifelong customer here.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Traffic around SF has reached a breaking point, especially around Yerba Buena where I live. A buddy from my office picked up a scooter and couldn't stop talking about how it changed his mobility around the city, so I decided to look into it.

I've ridden scooters before but consider myself a newbie, so I shopped around a bit. Was looking for something with a smaller footprint that could take short highway trips and fit a second passenger comfortably. Quick piece of advice – don't go to a motorcycle shop that ALSO sells scooters. The couple places like this I checked out had a seriously limited scooter selection, far less knowledgeable salespeople, and generally chunkier rides that seemed more like riffs off Honda cycles.

Ended up at SF Scooter Centre, and knew that this was where I'd pick up my new scooter. Barry and Diego, the guys running the front desk, were attentive, knowledgeable, and generally fun dudes. Also full of practical knowledge that they offered proactively – while I was there, a woman came in to buy a helmet and her and Barry got to talking about the scooter she was planning to buy off Craigslist. Barry told her she might want to call around to scooter shops in the area and ask them if they could service the model (because no one would want to). This useful tip was offered with zero condescension and no pressure to buy something from the shop instead.

Anyway, I spent over an hour checking out the different models, learning a ton from Barry about the pros/cons. All their scooters are pretty sleek, which presented the only challenge – picking out which model and color I wanted! Ended up coming out with a great deal on a new Buddy 170i in British racing green w/ white striping. The thing is a compliment machine, and I'm loving bombing around SF on it.

Even better, the shop also handles servicing and sells vintage scooters if that's your speed. I couldn't recommend them more highly. It's awesome to feel like you've got "a scooter guy" for all your current and future needs.

Thanks Barry and Diego!<//text>

<review>Barry Gwin, the owner of San Francisco Scooter Center (stylized - spelled "Centre") is knowledgeable and sells only the products that he believes in. Since 2004 I have bought 10 scooters from him.

Currently, he features the Genuine Buddy scooter line. They range in size from 125cc to 170cc. He also has the Buddy Kick.

In November 2018 I bought a Buddy 170i. That's the fuel injected model. I bought that to replace my 125 buddy that was stolen in October 2018. I had bought that 125 from Barry in 2007. That buddy never gave me a problem always look good  and was a great scooter.  That's why I bought another one that looks exactly the same, except it is a 2013.

Barry gave me a great price and a 60-day bumper to bumper warranty. That's excellent considering warranties nowadays that he would give me a 60-day 100% warranty.

I highly recommend that you check out Barry's store. You will not be disappointed. If anything you can tap his mind and expertise and know a lot more about scooters from when you walked in the door.

Note, he is closed on Mondays and maybe on Sundays. So if you're going to shop on the weekend make sure it's on a Saturday. San Francisco Scooter Center is on 10th, close to Mission. Plenty of scooter parking or motorcycle, and metered parking.

Warning, 10th Street is an aggressive thoroughfare for people to get around so be careful when on a scooter that you don't get mowed down by a car.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Super knowledgeable staff - everything from vintage to modern scooters. I have two vintage scooters from here, a Vespa and a '64 Lambretta and Barry and his crack team keep them on the road. I've been a customer here for 19 years.< /Text>

<text>The guys at this shop are great people to work with. They're honest, reliable and will help you understand your bike even when you have little knowledge on how the bike works :) You can buy your own parts and they'll work on it for you, or they will order parts for you for a fee. I prefer this shop over the few I've been to in SF because the guys seem to actually care about me, my bike, and my safety out there on the crazy roads. They're super fast when you show urgency, and care about what you have going on in life rather than just pushing you to the end of the day and not updating you at all. My review may not be too informative, but I wanted to throw out a good review because they deserve it. One thing I know for sure though, is if you're looking for a Buddy, and a great place to work on Buddy's, these are your guys! I have a SYM and the mechanics are knowledged and experienced with them as well.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Everyone here has been more than kind and taken the time to explain things to me. I got my first scooter from them and had just passed my written exam. They had even offered to drive it home for me but I had a friend already lined up for that. When I dropped my scooter a month later on Market by getting stuck in a muni track (which they warned me about) they were there to check over my scooter and with only scratches, no charge. Anywho, that was over a year ago and I get all my checkups and oil changes from here. Barry even donated to my fund raiser for Oaklands Children Hospital this year so please know there is a kind hearted dude here :)<//text>< time>

Barry and the rest of the people here know what they're doing and try to help you get the most life out of your scooter without breaking the bank.

Time and time again I've come here and gotten very fair prices. Often times Barry tells me that I really don't need to replace this or that yet. I remember first coming here after sticker shock at an $800 bill from SF Moto. He knocked off a bunch of things that I really just didn't need (yet) and I paid him $400. That was 2 years ago now. My Vespa LX-150 has been running great and been coming here ever since.

Also he taught me how to kick start my vespa.<//Text>

Fallon did an amazing job with my son. She was patient and made my son feel comfortable. She was funny and engaged my son in conversation.  She gave us some great hair styling tips and left my  6 year old son ready for his school dance. He loved his hair cut. 😊</Text>

Came in real quick on my lunch break and they gave me a quick trim that I desperately needed. My hairstylist made sure to keep me informed about the length she was cutting off so that we were on the same page and I truly appreciated that. She cut off the perfect amount where all my dead, split ends are. The women were really friendly and treated me so nicely. Thanks for the new haircut!< /Review>

Was actually surprised at this place given chain barber/salon reputation but it was empty when I went in and sat down right away. The girl that cut my hair was pretty funny but what I was happiest about was the speed. The cut came out 8/10 and the price was about 22 or 23 dollars which is the only downside. But you can pay with card so that's convenient.< /review>

What's the point of calling ahead and scheduling an appointment when they cannot even stick with the schedule?! My kid and I were suppose to get a cut for a holiday party but they had us waiting for over 40 minutes past our SCHEDULED appointment! We couldn't wait since we were on a tight schedule, so we left nappy heads and all. Thanks for the inconvenience and wasting our time. Definitely not coming back to have my time wasted again. I'd rather pay extra at any of the other barber shops within the 1 mile radius that will stick to their timing.</Review>

<Review>Great stylists! Make sure to call ahead to make an appointment because this place gets busy. But it is total worth it because you get great stylist who know what they are doing for the low Supercut's price. You wont get a great haircut at all Supercuts, but you will here!<//Review>< pics>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>Decent haircuts. But they always have 45+ minute waits not even during rush hour. At this point I'd rather pay extra and go to a barber shop here in Uptown Whittier. Long story short, you better be prepared to wait. And weekends have been as long as 2+ hour waits. Time to find a new place.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d3eb6c97c841:0xd71a1f14ef801df6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is a joke. The sign says they're open until 9p. I walked in with my son at 8:20p. They had two people cutting hair, and one kid waiting. They denied my son a cut, with a "sorry, we're done for the day". Been going there off and on for over 5 years... NEVER AGAIN!!! Tocayo's Barber Shop (down the street) it is!!!! -Coach Henry

< review>
My husband usually goes to his barber but due to his schedule he wasn’t able to make an appointment with his barber, he needed to run a formal errand and decided to go to this place for a haircut. After a few days of getting his haircut here he started to get really itchy in the back of his head. I assumed it was a rash to the pillows. We changed pillows, pillow cases, different soap, stopped using hair wax and products, changed hair brushes and even shampoo, but the rash only got worse and even started getting bumps on his head. After looking online the only reasonable thing was folliculitis. A rash that is developed by lack of hygiene of tools used to cut hair or shave. Since he hasn’t gotten a haircut since then, there is no way he could of gotten this from anywhere else.
I suppose if you’re willing to live with the torture of being itchy, loose your hair or even spread to others around you... definitely go.</review>

Make an appointment or you'll wait a long time. They charge if you request a stylist you like or are used too.< /review>

Just change your timings to when you can accept customers and please turn off the open sign if you are unable to take customers.   You mentioned till 9 pm and I reached at 8.50 pm with 2 ladies available and no waiting. I unfortunately couldn't reach before 8.50 pm and I think that should be more enough time to take care of a customer. I drove 4 miles to get to you but anyways please change the time so someone else can find options and don't waste time coming to your location.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>This was my first visit, Friday, Oct. 3, 2014 and I will be returning.  I used to cut hair and I am familiar with the business end as well. This service is top notch, the real deal.  Not only do they make eye contact, talk to you and treat you like they are really happy to see you, they ask the right questions, i.e., how do you want your hair cut, how long since your last cut (so they know about what length you would like it if you are asking for just a trim), etc. Then, on top of great attitudes, they actually give you an outstanding cut. Robin cut my hair and she is charming as well as talented.  No hotsy totsy atmosphere, no waiting if you arrive early, just simple, no drama, great service at better than reasonable prices. I tried the pigeon, you know the fancy facility on the corner that keeps you waiting and waiting even with an appointment, and I will never go back thanks to my friends who clued me in.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Every time I have to cut my hair I go to this location because not only are they friendly, but their prices are affordable. Plus, when there is someone new at this location I don't mind letting them cut my hair because every single person here that has worked on my hair leaves it looking well taken care of.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Sort of just reporting over the phone cost: for my short hair, shampoo, trim and blowdry (not styling) was $40.  Not counting tip that seems expensive to me!<//Text>

Really great food. I'd recommend giving this new place a shot if your looking for some amazing food. Portions are huge and very tasty. They also have an outdoor seating area out back. Definitely recommend to try the chili verde burrito, it's amazing!< /Review>

On Friday nights they have a steak platter to die for, and it is affordable. If you are into great service and small talk, I recommend speaking to the waitress, Mo'; one of the best service I've had in my life. She's hospitable and sweet. 🤗</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Mustang Sally's caught my eye one day while I was running on the Pacific Electric Trail. I saw a lot of people hanging out, having beers, and playing games in what looked like someone's really well-decorated and inviting backyard. I did a double-take and realized it was a bar. The following week, my boyfriend and I stopped on a Tuesday for a few beers and tacos (Taco Tuesday). We were not disappointed. The staff was incredibly welcoming, the food was great, and the beer was cold. If you're in the area, stop by for a drink - you won't regret it.<//Review></record>

<text>Would have given it 5 stars but it was so hot outside and the inside was just a bit cooler. But the important things were great. The Friday steak dinner was very good and my husband said he believed they just might have the best hamburger in all of Rancho. The 20 Oz ice cold canned beers were $5 served in a frosted glass if you ask. Sodas sadly were just under $3 and you were given a room temp can and a glass of ice. The fries were delish. Looking forward to cooler weather and coming back for breakfast and perhaps eating outside. Yes, it took awhile to be served but the service was pleasant and we were in no hurry. It was an enjoyable dinner.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

The Friday Night Steak dinner special (w/baked potatoe and salad) for $9.99 is delicious! Best deal in town!
If you haven't tried it go check it out! But go early, they do not stay open late and may run out of the steak dinners so go by early evening</Text>

I've been here multiple times for both breakfast and lunch. The food is great. Sometimes it can be a really long wait time for food though. Laid back people will love it.< /Review></record>

< Review>
My family and I have driven past this place dozens of times and finally decided to give it a try today for lunch. Like other have stated the menu is small just a few breakfast choices. Some appetizers. A 4 item kids choice and a few other things.

I decided to go ahead and order some breakfast so I went with the French toast. You can get a half size or a full size. I did the half and I'm glad I did the full might have been a little too much for me. It was delicious. These French toast actually had flavor to them unlike alot of other places. My parents ordered the tacos which they said were good. And the chips and salsa that they give are yummy.

Everything is made fresh to order so don't expect your food to come out super fast.</Review>

<Text>Would not normally frequent grthis type of establishment and I was pleasently surprised at Mustang Sally's. With it's Roadhouse decore, smaller size and at the time customer base in my age group, I enjoyed myself thuroughly. Good draft and bottled beer selection and many choices in the food category to pair with all those brews, I will definitely be back to give Mustang Sally's a more in depth review. They also have one of the most cleaver "Juke Boxes" I have encountered. All songs are from the internet with an almost limitless list of music. When I wanted to listen to some E. Clapton I was given about 500+ choices, amazing. This is also a beer and wine only establishment and if you have your children in tow a good choice as they have outside dining.</Text>< Pictures>

Service was SLOW, and the food was lacking sustenance. My daughters grilled cheese had no cheese and the tacos were so small it was a joke. We waited 2 hours to get our food and the server couldn’t even handle getting it right. We waited 45 minutes for drinks and I honestly could have stood up and gotten my own drink. Hire staff that can do their job or shut down. I wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy.< /Review>

< Review>
So, went here because the reviews made it seem like the place to be. Unfortunately this is probably the worst restaurant I have been to. Went in on a Sunday around 11:45 Am. Walked in and wasn't really greeted. Was told " You can take a seat if you like but won't be taking orders until 20 min". Did not seem like a big deal at first until, 30 min passed by and no one came up to the table. I'm talking about not one person said can I get you water or menus to look at or even hello or I'm sorry we're behind. Not one word. Everyone looked frantic trying to get the tables outside going. Then one of the waitresses with glasses was talking about perhaps about a coworker with another coworker. Hand gestures and everything lol. And I'm assuming those were the owners who came in and out without solving it greeting anything. So I assume they knew the situation at hand. I was just baffled. It almost was too surreal. So me and my family got up and walked out. The host/waitresses stood at the post tapping away and did not make eye contact or verbal as we left.
Horrible, horrible, horrible.</Review>

Little restaurant family owned. They only have so much food. So it doesn't last the whole time they are open. I went there for a steak dinner but they ran out of steak by 730</review>

Loooove this place due to their big & huuuge steak that is more than you can handle it . Most of the time it's a 1 Lb huuuuge piece of meat that comes w/ a side of salad , &  a small baked potato. The only down side about this place is that they're are not open everyday . Only from Wednesday to Sunday & their hrs are not consistant either . If you don't mind their weird- ness then, their food & price are really awsome , & will make Up for it !! $ 10 dollars for the 1 Lb steak most of the time , & you can't go wrong with that at all !  This place has been our favorite little gem place , every time we crave for a big juicy steak , although I have to admit that their beers are a bit expensive though . $ 5.75 per can . Other than that , the place looks a little bit rustic , & the decor inside needs a greaaat revamp in my point of view . Outside the patio is ok , & could need some helps as well to elevate some good moods .<//review>

<gmapID>0x80c336a243dcde2f:0x4bc0a829d5fccb22<//gmapID><pics>None</pics><text>I'm on the fence on whether I want to give a 3 or 4 Star review. My husband and I came here for the first time on Sunday 10/1/2017. We arrived at 8:30AM.  We pulled into the lot right after another vehicle, but they were not busy at all at this time.

Since I saw they allow dogs here (from Yelp), we had two of our dogs with us and asked to sit outside. Our server came outside after 5 minutes to give us menus and take our drink order. We did not see her again for another 10 minutes. My husband and I decided to share the Chile Verde burrito and the "Eggtastic" breakfast which included biscuits and gravy, sausage or bacon, 2 eggs, and potatoes.

The quaint outdoor area has cute decor and has plenty of seating; including picnic benches. There are games to play such as cornhole (bean bag toss), horseshoe toss, and even Jenga. There are also people riding their bikes or walking.

The Biscuits & Gravy were the first to come out. Although delicious, I thought the biscuits underneath the gravy were cold. Our server also brought a bowl of water for our dogs which was kind.

After that, the rest of our meal took about 30 minutes. We had the whole back patio/play area to ourselves so we were able to keep ourselves occupied, but may have been a different scenario if we were sitting inside and staring at the wall.

The chile verde wet burrito had good flavors, but my husband said his half only had about 2 pieces of meat in it while mine had more. It had a bit of a kick to it, but my husband said he didn't like the texture of the tortilla. He's had better wet burritos. The sausage that came with the Eggtasic plate were very tasty and the potatoes were delicious. Our bill came out to $25.00.

Overall, I give it a 3. When I discussed our overall experience with my husband we did conclude that we would return but that we shouldn't come hungry. We would probably just get an order of nachos and some tacos and relax on their back patio; knowing that the food takes a while. Our server also mentioned that they are expecting to put TVs outside.  This place has potential with its location and menu offerings so an updated review may be warranted in the future.</text>< date>

< Review>
Well first we were the only ones there on a Wednesday at 6pm. and the only ones there when we left. Bad sign. Its a cute place, the food was ok, we had tacos that were ok, my wife had a chile verde burrito that was very watery, big but not the best, My son in law had a gynormous burger. looked awesome, served with big mashed potato frozen fries, they were good though. the menu has changed its real small not much to offer. My daughter asked about salads, the server said they took them off the menu, really? they server breakfast but only a couple of items. so sad I want them to do well, They need a better menu, and marketing or they will drop out like so many others. Hope that listen..<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>My husband and I figured we would try something new so we thought we would give this place a try.
I ordered the Chiliquilles and made sure to ask for it crispy the waitress said "oh yes  of course I'll make sure it's done very crispy".  She suggested the green sauce I said ok.  I ordered  2 over easy eggs. Ok so this is what I got.  Chiliquille soup,  the tortillas were soggy as heck, the eggs were very well done that the yolk was stiff.  The green sauce was actually a salsa Verde with pork Meat and potatoes served in a bowl like soup.  Everything in the bowl was soggy.  Not good at all.  I told the waitress and she said oh sorry I didn't cook the food.  My husband ordered the Breakfast Burrito.  The description on the menu of what's inside the Burrito isn't what he got.  It was more like a salsa Verde Burrito.   So I'm wondering if everything you order has salsa Verde in it.  This place was so disappointing we will NEVER be back again.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I have been eating here over 12 years and I love everything.  Very authentic and very fresh.  The owner is very sweet.  It's a joy to have great food in this area which is hard to find.  The soups and enchilada dinners are my favorite.  The salad is so fresh plus that homemade dressing...yummy!< /text>

Way too many chickpeas in the tamales. There was also potato in there too that wasn't cooked all the way,and the pork did not taste like much. The outside part was wet and drippy too. I would not recommend.< /Text>

On the plus side, the experience of eating here was pleasant. The restaurant takes credit cards, is clean, and had friendly staff who bring the food to you. Even though the space was small and crowded it didn't feel uncomfortable. The menu is extensive and had some standouts including the rice and beans and the fresh corn tortillas.< /Review>

<text>I love this place. Not the typical Mexican food you'd get elsewhere. I've had the gorditas, empanadas, and chicken plate, all were good (really like the gorditas). The chips and salsa are really good. Agua frescas and horchata are good. Friendly employees, delicious food and drinks.< /text>< Pics>

<review>I was there Jun/8/2019 around 5:30pm. My First impression was small place and didn't look clean (that should of been a warning sign) but since I was with a group of 5 they really wanted to eat there.
We were all ready seated for about 30min and had ordered our food. We saw a fat cockroach with an egg right above where they place the food. We immediately told the lady waiter and cancelled our order(She saw it as well and didn't say anything).We honestly felt bad cancelling because our food was ready to serve. I hope they do something about it and not keep serving food while they probably have an infestation of cockroaches. This was our first time and Last time going there.<//review><Rating>1< /Rating>< Date>

If mine and my husbands steak had not been seriously burnt first time around; they would have gotten 5 stars! I will say though; they brought us new fresh pieces of steak which were great but; we were full by then from the other food on our plate. They never gave us attitude and were very friendly and apologetic about the burnt steak. Other than that, service was great, food was also (the unburned steak was amazing) the prices are a bit high for the quantity you receive but eh, I definitely plan on going back again SOON! :)<//review>

The New Spot was making my favorite burritos in the city. I was super bummed when they closed, but I just learned that their sister restaurant Gilberth's is now serving some of their menu items!! I tried the carnitas burrito tonight and it was AMAZING. So good.<//review>

I really love the food here. Beware of your surroundings inside. There is gambling that takes place in the back by the bathroom. People off the street stop by to sell stuff.</Text>

<rate>3</rate><Text>Breakfast plates are really great, unfortunately place is not so clean. I don’t like their Mexican food because they do not know how to make it, it tastes horrible. They need to remove it from their menu. I have also tried their Churrascó Nicaragüense and it’s really good and comes with hand made tortillas, it’s just really great. Comes with carne azada, special cabbage salad, rice with beans (not so great) I rather get their refríes beans, and a choice of fried plantains or toasted ones and either one is a great choice, but if you don’t mind paying for both they’re great. I have also tasted their baleadas which is a Honduran plate, which consists in a flower tortilla with a few different choices. I like to get it with refried beans, scrambled eggs, avocado, sour cream and cheese. It’s just so good.<//Text>< Pics>

Place has pretty good food. However their beef soup wasn't as good as I thought it would. Very fatty bland chunks of beef. Their breakfast platters are really good and so is their horchata. People who dine there can be a bit rude though, mostly cus they are beyond intoxicated.</Review>

It's the weekend, this place has mainly Spanish drunks intoxicated. The waitress, get them drunk and over charge them at the end. Very low class and dirty walls, smelly bathroom with oily walls near the kitchen. Come see for yourself if you doubt. Not good atmosphere at all, walked out.</review>

Very bland and fatty chunks of beef in the sopa. Female workers pay more attention to the drunk and rude male customers trying to flirt then getting your order right. Ordered the breakfast this morning that had chorizo con huevo and they literally put a half teaspoon of actual meat in the eggs (versus in the mission where they will have big chunks in the eggs) but want to charge a $1.50 extra. Very small portions. Felt cheated paying almost $13 for this crap. Won't be going here again.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I like the food and the attention, what I do not agree with is that they put a limit of purchase when requesting delivery, and besides they charge me an additional 10 dollars for bringing the food, normally I always ask for two dishes between 25 or 26 dollars. Thank you ...

(Translated by Google) The food is very tasty but the attention is very bad, the so-called waitresses do not go around at all to write down orders and that is why they do not take orders well and it is a place a bit neglected in cleaning.

La comida está muy rica pero la atención es muy mala las supuestas meseras no andan nada para anotar las órdenes y por eso no toman bien las órdenes y es un lugar un poco descuidado en la limpieza.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I went to visit them for the first time because I live nearby, but I was disappointed I asked for a chicken soup and they gave me a mixture of beef soup with chicken soup, the portion of the chicken room that was hoe was burned and looked like a pigeon for being So small when I told my opinion to the owner she contradicted me but the smell of the soup and the color were different from a chicken soup, they wanted to change the dish, but I left disappointed and I will never return

(Original)
Fui a visitarlos por 1a vez porque vivo cerca, pero me lleve una decepcion pedi una sopa de gallina y me dieron un mezcla de sopa de res con sopa de gallina la porcion del cuarto de gallina q estaba azada estaba quemada y parecia de paloma por ser tan pequeña cuando le dije mi opinion a la dueña me contradijo pero el olor de la sopa y el color eran diferentes de una sopa de gallina, me quisieron cambiar el plato, per y me fui decepcionada y nunca volveré</Review>

There was some little chick who pushed my kid at the playground, I didn't like that. Had to stay away from play area because of this, other than unattended kids due to mom too busy with non-motherly business, I guess it was cool. We had ice cream from the truck, climbed trees, pretended the falling leaves was snow, the sun was just right, perfect amount of rays not too bright not too dark not too hot not too cold. Made memories a camera could never catch and no one can ever erase... Went on to have more adventures at the Pasadena garden, before the park we went to the nature center too 👍</Text>

Recently Remodeled, beautiful park, and great for the whole family. Park has a playground, full size basketball court, baseball/softball field, and lots of grassy space for any activities, exercising, and bringing your pet to the park.</Text>

<text>This is a nice little park with a nice little playground. Ok well honestly, it could use some love - some people let their dogs cra p all over the place and the grass is a minefield of gopher holes enough to break your ankle, but it's quiet and seems pretty clean. I was surprised by my first visit, especially given the proximity of the highway. I'd go again.< /text>< pics>

Nice park with huge open spaces, basketball court, playground, workout space, and bathrooms. There used to be a lot of homeless people hanging around here but I haven't seen many lately.</Text>

Pascual Park. WoW.  New discovery.  They have a kids jungle bar play station. Place to eat.  Family friendly.  No rift raft.  Grass is green well maintained. Favorite of day was. They have a fairly new work out area. For children & adults must be 13 years & up.  You sit in the seat and pull down these chrome looking arms slowly releasing them.  You can feel your arms working.  Great way to rid of those flabby arms</text>

The man there found he had a 20 x 30 so we took that one and he transferred me over to the new unit. Very nice people.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Had a unit here for about 2 years, the facility was always very clean. My biggest problem was that once I got all my stuff out and started going through it I realized I had been robbed at some point. Too bad I was already half way across the country in Oklahoma. I left my storage unit for a year and a half in hopes my belongings would be safe. There was family heirlooms I will never get back. And if I were to notice the items missing at the time what would they have done? Watched a year and a half of video footage? I’m not even sure how someone could even have access to my unit.? I suggest that who’s ever on duty or in charge of security pay attention to the facility more. Instead of just taking ID’s and handing over the access key maybe check the names FIRST to see if they’re even a tenant.</Text>

The registration process was so simple. I chose this facility because of the use of their moving truck. We are all under 25 but that age minimum did not stop us. They really worked with us to help us out. Thanks!</Text>

The manager and other staff at this location went so above and beyond their duties and were all so helpful and considerate! I couldn't have gotten luckier in such an unlucky situation.

<review>Rented few times from this location and service is always great. Easy to do business with, associates very focused on customer-service. Ended up bringing recent rental back early since didn't end up needing rental for entire week. Only charged for the days used the rental and no return-early fee.<//review><response>{'time': 1613948097340, 'text': 'Hi Kate, we really appreciate your positive review!

During the rental period, my wife and I were faced with an overlap of schedules necessitating another rental for a day. Made the reservation , and upon arrival at the location, was told that I could only have one car rented in my name. The said that my wife could rent a car, but she had left for her business earlier in the morning and was unavailable to complete the transaction. I have been renting from Enterprise for almost 20 years, and have never run into this policy. At best, the reservations system could have caught this and informed me of this policy. The staff at San Fernando did little to help me, they just told me that this was the policy.  I have over 16,000 miles in their rewards program, and I expected a little more than just I'm sorry.
Outcome of this was I lost the deal that I was going to close, paid for another Uber home, called the 800 number for complaints and was told that, "someone would get back to me".  It's been three weeks and I have heard nothing. This is the first time I have ever given a negative revue for this company.  I will be using up my points and looking for another company. VERY unhappy.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Enterprise Rental Car located at 9827 DE SOTO AVE
CHATSWORTH, CA 91311-441
A gentleman representative by the name of Jorge answered my call.  I was in a very bad situation and instead of finishing his lunch, he was at my location to pick me up within 8 minutes.  I have nothing but praise and appreciation for this gentleman.  Enterprise saved me from a very bad situation and without a thought, CAME TO MY RESCUE!  I'll never forget this act of kindness and will rent from Enterprise whenever I'm in need of renting a vehicle.

<user_name>Michael O'Donnell</user_name><text>I will never rent from enterprise ever again. The first car they gave me was dirty, literally had cheetos in the back seat and the check engine light turned on 100 yards off of their lot. The second car they gave me had severe tire issues. I had to put air in them every day for a week. When I reported this I was told I'd get a discount. Not only did they not give me a discount, they charged me an extra day when I returned it on the day they told me it was due. I'd rather drive an extra 20miles and rent from Alamo or Hertz. Never again will I give Enterprise a single cent of my hard earned money.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>The employees are efficient, well spoken, try to advocate for the customer and they seem to know their jobs well.   With the rental-car business (especially in 2020) slumping, it is sort of disappointing that daily rental rates have still not softened - - Virtually impossible to get a sub-compact nor an economical (like a Frontier) pick-up under $50.   Uber and Lyft are looking more and more attractive lately.<//review>< Time>

<text>As a 35+ year customer of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, I am extremely disappointed with our recent rental experience. My private cell phone number was shared, without my permission or prior authorization, with 8 other Enterprise customers. The content of the group text message (by the Chatsworth Enterprise Branch) was to solicit a positive review. After reporting to Enterprise management my complete dissatisfaction with this unauthorized privacy breach, I received a very dismissive and dissatisfying phone call that was a verbal comment only. THIS IS A TRULY HORRIBLE AND COMPLETELY DISSATISFYING OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. This is UNACCEPTABLE and UNREASONABLE and not how companies that desire  (at least with respect to their expressed Corporate Value) to deliver an "overall excellent rental experience" should operate; especially after me being a customer for 35+ years. We will never rent from Enterprise again. I am truly sorry that I had to select 1 star for this review! They deserve 0 stars! No one deserves to be treated in this manner, especially when it comes to public sharing of personal contact information, privacy, and confidentiality.</text><gmap_id>0x80c29cc7231709fd:0x24109008ced6e2e8</gmap_id>< UserId.>

The 3 times that I've needed to rent a car since relocating to the area, I've used this Enterprise location.  The staff is attentive and friendly. Each time I felt that they were there to make sure I'm happy and get in a vehicle and on my way quickly. They excel at customer service and always have quality cars available to rent. I highly recommend Enterprise, especially this branch, for your rental car needs!< /review>

I’ve used the Chatsworth, Ca Enterprise 3 times within the last 5 weeks, usingnit so often because the rental fees are so good and the cars always in top form.
The check in and check out were easy and the agents really friendly.
I am looking to get a new car and have gotten a better handle on which car I like.
Thank you Enterprise!< /Text>

Very reasonable pricing. I had a car for a week for $179.....extremely friendly & helpful staff in the Chatsworth office. As a senior citizen I don't use credit cards. Most other rental agencies will not accept debit cards. This company, especially this new location, has twice now made it easy and pleasant to rent from them. (Not everyone without a major credit card is a flake). So until I get my own car repaired  this is where I will go when I need a car! Thank you Enterprise!!< /text>

Great experience all the way through! Brandon at the Chatsworth location was awesome, he went out of his way to make sure I rented the right car. I'd like to say thank you to the woman who stayed 7 minutes after closing to check the car in. I'd rent from them again.< /text>

The car I rented here smelled like cigarettes and had a dirty windshield. The windshield problem was only noticeable when it started raining, and the smell was pretty bad in the back. Unfortunately, I rented the car lat on Friday and didn't notice the problems later at night when it started raining.  However, the representative fixed the problems and were very gracious in accepting their responsibility and making sure I didn't leave dissatisfied. Kudos to the lady who helped me.< /Text>

I used to love this place but now you can't form a business bound with the employees because they change staff too frequently.  The fleet of cars have gone down hill. I travel for business frequently and all I ask is for a clean car inside and out and at least 1/2 tank of gas because I'm usually driving to a hearing and don't have time to stop to get gas. Sometimes my employees are traveling with me and have been embarrassed at the filthy car that I was given, especially since you have a car wash on site. I am an Enterprise member and my account has a note about my needs. I don't understand why this is not recognized when I pick a car for state travel?</text>

<Text>My confirmation was sent by a third party vendor, travelocity, and directed me to the wrong address. The location had moved. There was no signage or notification, I just happened to walk past a local shop owner that told me I was in the wrong place, that they had moved Months earlier. I no longer could walk to pick up the car and had to make complicated arragaments to pick up the rental. Hours of my morning were spent navigating through the chaos yet no one apologized, kept saying not their fault, that they have "tried to notify other places"
Then they gave me a rental car- gas tank empty- and I said that after hours of making up for the mix up I was in a rush to get where I needed to go, having to immediately stop for gas is not considerate of the customer- the rep told me that because of the policy that customers only need to fill it to where it was filled to "they are usually left on empty" and went on to say "it would be a waste of time to fill up cars all day" I ended up filling the car, to ensure I had enough for my long drive, and basically gave them a full tank at the end of the day.
Horrible service.

<Text>Following a head on collision  I got a rental in Chatsworth. I had the car a month before I got a new car. Upon returning the rental a young lady helped my transfer my stuff from the rental to my new car. When I got home I noticed a $20 bill with my stuff. I thought Wow! That was really honest which is a bit unexpected in todays world. Way to Go Enterprise!

The enterprise I used to use back home in Cincinnati always credited me extra gas. Chatsworth needs to catch up.</text><user_name>Mr. M<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I rented on Saturday because my car was in repair at Chatsworth Tire.  I assumed that I couldn't return the car until Tuesday because they were closing at noon on Saturday and Monday is a work day for me. However, my car was ready by 5pm Saturday, so Angel at Chatsworth Tire suggested that I leave the rental with them.  He would call it in on Monday morning.  Well, Enterprise in Chatsworth "went the extra mile" and just charged me for the one day that I used it.  Good fellows there, and I'll use them again and again.  The family that runs Enterprise has kept the "family spirit" through and through.<//review>

The paperwork took very little time and their representative was very pleasant.  The car I got as my loaner was very clean,  it had no smoking odors.

Fantastic service and support from Jason Hamed at the Chatsworth Enterprise location.  I had driven down to Chatsworth to visit my son and family from Northern California and my car broke down, so I needed a rental to get around the area.  Jason was extremely helpful and even recommend a place, M.B.Z. Auto, to get my Mercedes repaired - a great recommendation.  I am very happy with the service that I received there and at Enterprise Rental Car.<//Text>

I used to live here and have rented from them before without any problem. Now I'm here for a visit and am told I can not rent using my visa debit because I don't have a local address. Only way to rent is at the airport so they can enter my return flight info. Why make it possible to rent from airport but not from local office. Poor policy Enterprise. Hertz here I come.</review>

They looked out for me 9 months straight this year when I needed rentals. I live in Moorpark and there are a few closer locations to my home. However, Liz, Brandon,  Jason all really took care of me so I chose to go to their branch which was about 15 minutes from my job.</Text>

<Text>Shady!!!! They quoted me one price when i rented the car and changed my quote (by over $100) when i tried to return it.  They tried to add on additional charges and reduced my 10% discount to a 5% discount. My advice is to make sure you save your quoted price because they are going to try to rip you off. This establishment should be embarrassed that they try to deceive their customers like that.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1503446140971, 'text': "We're listening and would like to know more, Nayri Kodojian.

<rating>4</rating><review>Dark Nectar has good coffee (hot, cold, or blended), tea, and chai. They sell individual pie slices from a local pie maker in Atascadero. The music they play is usually pretty nice. They have books, board games, and darts to stay occupied while visiting. It's nice to see that they were able to remain open after the covid-19 shutdown.<//review>< Pictures>

Personally I think this place has the best local roasted beans in the area. I don't make it here often but I always take a bag of beans togo when I do. They will gladly grind the beans to your liking as well.</Text>

I am very disappointed with this place it was my first time eating here and it was my birthday too. let me start off with poor service the guy server was rude has no manners and didn't take us as customers serious he tried skipping us in line thinking we didn't know Spanish. We waited 45 for simple plates when the other customers that came after us got there food first and they had more food then what we ordered. We sat outside in patio watching others eat and didn't even have our drinks. Not sure how this restaurant is still open. The food was not worth the wait I wish I could give the -10 rating never going back. The only reason we came here was because the other place we go to was closed BiBi's Honduras restaurant please take your business there they have better service, food and Tortillas come with meal un like this place. One more thing meat is over salted.<//text>

<Review>Everything truly tasted fresh and homemade; such simple flavors but they all work incredibly well together. There wasn't one component I didn't enjoy. This will definitely become a go-to for those laziest of nights. One of the best meals I've had in a long time!</Review><Name>Nick Hanzz< /Name></record>

<Text>They got a nice special baleadas for $1.25 but the best part is they can add asada or chorizo for a little extra and the flour tortillas are hand made . If you are around HP and want to get something quick stop by.<//Text>< pics>

Nosotros ordenamos tajaditas con carne molida y cebolla en curtido. También ordenamos la especial de 6 baleadas por $1.25 cada una. Todo estuvo muy delicioso. Un poco caro por las tajaditas pero no estamos en Honduras entonces "it's worth the price" lol.

We got the plantain chips with ground beef and Honduran sauce with the pink pickled onions (super yum). We also ordered the special of the day that was 6 baleadas for $1.25 each which is a deal bc normal price one is $2.99. the tajaditas are a bit pricey if you compare to how much they cost in Honduras but since we out here in Cali it's definitely worth the price. Overall I'm a happy catracha and I love coming here. Family has been coming since they first opened and now I bring my friends as an adult. Woa character growth.</text>

I feel like the food could be too expensive for a simple baliana $3.50  The 5 pound of flour Is less than 5 bucks. Unfortunately we do not have no good Honduras restaurants   to represent us. So sad so sad.<//Text>

They have a live MC, parking is a bit tough and so is the neighborhood. The food was ok and the baliadas are extremely small. No to mention how expensive the food was. My hunt for the perfect baliadas continues.< /Text>

The baliadas were pure beans with drops of crema they forgot to put cheese. I asked for some with avacados and they were rotten so I didn't enjoy them at all. The service was horrible had to ask for everything won't be returning at all. Now my stomach is acting up.<//Text>

< Review>
This is the worst place ever. The food is utterly disgusting and badly prepare. Their service is the worst. The owner of this "restaurant" was called when we came to return our food and he told us yelling not to come back and that he didnt want our business when we simply requested them to remake the food. This is not only disturbing because hes the owner but the fact that they tried to put it on me because I said I wanted the food well done as the previous time I ordered, it was raw!! I am so disappointed and frankly quite angry because I also made this complaint on uber eats but they still allow poor quality food to be given to us.<//Review>

< Review>
I could've easily robbed this place. I went in and no one was at the front. The lady was in the back talking. I tried making noise. After a couple of minutes i finally called her a few times. Still went unnoticed. at least 7 minutes in all. Then the food arrived, worst chicken ever! It looked spoiled, not fully cooked, and well actually just seemed microwaved for a minute. Warm on the outside, cold in the inside. I took a bite or two before throwing the whole thing to the trash. Waste of time and money. At least the lady was nice. But only being nice doesn't cut it in the food industry. That chicken, raw and old the way it was could send someone to the hospital. How's that for an expensive meal.</Review>

<Text>This place is so lit let me tell you. One time we were here and this lady starts putting money into this guys clothes (he was singing) but then her boy friend starts getting mad and It looks like they're about to fight but they don't and the couple starts drinking more (like they downed some beers together #relationshipgoals) and everything was cool. Also food.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The waitresses were nice but they messed up my order and expected me to take it the way it was. The kabobs meat was so tough! So hard too chew which made it un-enjoyable. It was food that you can honestly make at home. Not savory.  While eating the djs were sound checking and too loud. Honestly, not worth the price. We would have had better luck at a chillis lol. Weve been to the Vermont kitchen and that one has a better rating than this one in our opinion.< /review>

<review>i really like this restaurant but the reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because i had a bad experience one time. It wasn't the food, but i bought a coupon on groupon for $11. This $11 coupon has a $22 worth at the restaurant. So i purchased 2 of them. The coupon said $22 because that's how much i payed. I gave that coupon to my husband as an early birthday present. We went to eat and i asked the waiter what can i get with this coupon he recommended we get the PARILLADA. So we got that with 2 drinks. The food was AMAZING. really yummy. i have no complaints about that. we got a little bit of everything on that parillada. if i remember correctly the bill came to be around $25-$30. Then he discounted $22. The coupon was suppose to discount double which is $44. I told him and he said sorry but the coupon says $22 ...you can talk to them if you have an issue. Later i found out it was my mistake and that u can only use one coupon per table. So his mistake actually gave me the real discount without his knowledge though. If the coupon said $11 he would of given me $11 instead of $22. I just think if your going to deal with groupon you should have your stuff together. Yes it was my mistake as well but he could of explained what groupon explained to me, but he had no idea the coupon was actually worth $22. Either then that the food and service is great. I recommend paying with cash or credit when you go and avoid the coupons.</review>< username>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I came to buy today April 6, 2021 a chicken with slices of banana and uff so I loved it and gone to many places and the only one that I eat whole is in this restaurant the very rich baleada but a lot of beans but it is very tasty

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, I ordered slices with ground meat, and they brought it to me with chicken, and I told them they brought it to me again with the ground meat all cold and a dry meat, I will not come again, I do not recommend them, very bad experience. It's not worth paying so much for food SO that I eat it better.

Muy mal servicio,ordene tajadas con carne molida, y me lo llevaron con pollo, y les dije me lo trajeron otra ves  ya con la carne molida todo frío y una carne reseca, no vuelvo a venir, no los recomiendo, muy mala experiencia. no vale la pena pagar tanto por comida ASI que yo la consino mejor.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c91ffcfd99d1:0x1925219edb74f315< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service, the food is NOT good ... the waitress / cashier thinks she is the owner of the place and after serving the dishes she never comes back if you need anything else, and for that reason we ordered pupusas from the restaurant next door, we ate it there And for that if he went to tell us that we could not eat from another place to which I told him that we were already finishing and we were already leaving and he replied that he would not leave us for the next time, because hopefully I will be a message because there will NOT be another occasion Besides being very expensive, his food is ugly and miserable! Ahhh and they serve it cold, very bad experience ...

(Original)
Pésimo servicio, la comida NO está buena... la mesera/cajera se cree la dueña del lugar y después de servir los platillos nunca regresa si necesitas algo más, y por esa razón pedimos pupusas de el restaurant de a lado, la comimos ahí y para eso si fue a decirnos ke no podíamos comer de otro lugar a lo cual le dije ke pues ya estábamos terminando y ya nos hibamos y me respondió ke para la próxima no nos dejaría, pues ojalá les esté mensaje x ke NO habrá otra ocasión, además de ke esta carísimo esta fea su comida y miserable!!! Ahhh y la sirven fria muy mala experiencia...< /text>

(Translated by Google) It is the worst restaurant where I have been able to buy flour tortillas, I asked for 15 tortillas to take away and I already got home and I saw them all burned, it is incredible to have to pay to throw them away

(Translated by Google) We made an order through Uber Eats, we ordered 3 soups, 1 snail 1 tripe 1 man's soup, the 3 soups did not bring lemon, it did not bring slices, or tortillas the man's soup does not bring crab and the rice as it was a gift, they should be more responsible with the people who serve the food, thank you ....

Hicimos un pedido por Uber Eats, pedimos 3 sopas, 1 de caracol 1 mondongo 1 sopa de hombre, las 3 sopas ninguna traía limón, no traía tajadas, ni tortillas la sopa de hombre no trae jaiba y el arroz como que era regalado, deberían ser más responsables con las personas que sirven la comida, gracias....< /text>

They are always wrong with the receipts and they charge you for others if you realize they return you and if you did not wash yourself 😩
Now I understand why almost no people arrive.

(Translated by Google) Honduras kitchen never go to this place bad service from the waitresses who do not look happy and order two baliadas that are better the Guerrero tortillas from the store than the ones they serve in this place also reheated chicken and hard slices that seemed from a day Before and worst, prices are very high for a very poorly cooked meal. Never go to eat at this place. Better go to the tacos in any corner. You will have a better time.

Never go to this place. Bad service from the waitresses, they don't look to happy themselves. Don’t order Dos Valiadas, Guerrero tortillas from the grocery store taste better than the one served at this place! Also the Pollo Reheated y Taradas Duras, they look they were made from the day before. The worst and high prices all round for very bad cooking food. Never go eat to this place, instead go the tacos from the corner stand.

(Translated by Google) As a Honduran I am sorry but the truth is that I do not recommend eating here there are better places, like katracho seasoning # 2, that is a place where I can recommend the taste of the food is closer to that of Honduras, and if you do not believe me , ask for a fried chicken from here and then ask for one of the caprecho seasoning and they will know the difference

(Original)
Como hondureño me da pesar pero la verdad que no recomiendo comer acá hay mejores lugares, como el sazón katracho #2, ese es un lugar al que puedo recomendar el sabor de la comida se acerca más a la de Honduras, y si no me cree, pida un pollo frito de aca y después pidan uno del sazón catracho y sabrán la diferencia< /Review>

(Translated by Google) They lack better staff, because the people who attend are terrible, so they don't even want to go to eat at the restaurant, much less leave tips. They should pay more attention to that. They should also lower the prices a bit because they are very expensive or at least the sodas. But also there to say that the food is good, and it is the best restaurant for the baliadas, in the food if I recommend it 100% .. the staff have to work more and that is why I give 3 stars because the others very well.

(Original)
Les falta mejor personal, porque las personas que atienden son pésimas, asi ni dan ganas  de ir a comer al restaurante, mucho menos dejar tips. Deberían de poner más atención en eso. También Deberían bajarle un poco a los precios porque si están bien caros o por lo menos a las sodas. Pero también ahí que decir que la comida está bien, y es el mejor restaurante para las baliadas, en la comida si lo recomiendo 100%.. en el personal tienen q trabajar más y por eso doy 3 estrellas porque los demás muy biem.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It does not serve the food it does not have flavor it is super expensive I do not recommend fence that place I present myself as it is a torrejas .. and the meat for enchiladas pure fat sap. And the slices with ground meat if 16 slices came and the fatty meat. Ripe plantain was 8 slices and the dishes are served in small plates to put tortillas. The maraculla is what they sell in for4les from A & 2 h to a dollar. When it is special to the owners, I hired good cooks who cook well. no quality

(Translated by Google) In my opinion about what I ate last night, I didn't like the food at all, it was ugly or not wanting to eat, they give it a chance and one is looking to eat rich, not an ugly meal, I know this because I am from my country Honduras if the pleasure of blessing fast food and to give something that is not good, the drink is the most expensive and e rightly taken, it was just the place, I just didn't like anything about what was sold to me and it was a chop in majinate the rest. Bye and excuse me but it is my opinion I do not usually do it but this kiss if half courage because I thought it was my country and they are very low from what they want

(Original)
En mi opinión sobre lo que comi anoche no me gusto para nada la comida estava fea ni ganas de comer le dan auno y uno busca comer rico no una comida fea se esto por que soy de mi pais Honduras si el placer de bender comida alo rapido y dar algo que no sirve esta mal la bebida es la mas cara que e tomado con razón estaba tan solo el lugar solo que no me gusto nada delo que me vendieron y era una chuleta en majinate lo demas. Bye y disculpen pero es mi opinión no suelo aserlo pero esta bes si medio coraje por pense que era mi pais y estan muy bajo desde lo que quieren</text>
