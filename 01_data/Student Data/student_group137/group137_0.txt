I had a very bad experience in Avis LAX.
We booked a car via Ctrip agency.
We were told the car we booked was no longer available, we got a different car which was fine. However the staff let us to sign the contract without noticing us the extra insurance, we found that the insurance was added without our permit. The package price was also more expensive than what we booked via agency.
The worst part is when we returned the car, the lady staff was extremely rude to us. When we asked the detail of extra money, she got so rude that she kept warning us to check the contract we signed, I’ve never seen such bad attitude, I got so angry with her. I have to catch up the flight and just didn’t have time to bargain.
I paid extra $250+, $60 for gas which is ok, another for no reason,  I’ve claimed this to the agency. I hope Avis customer service can also check out this review for your incredible staff.

I used Avis in Canada once which gave me a really good impression, however it totally changed my view of this company, I won’t use Avis anymore. Also a reminder to international travelers to check the extra insurance when pick up.< /text>

I had a great experience. In and out in a speedy process. Excellent customer service.
What I did not like was how Ryan made the assumption that I would “need” an extra day and indirectly made me sign the contract from 02/19/20 to 02/21/20....when in actuality I only needed the car for 02/19-02/20. So what he assumed was different from what I reserved which made my total go up.

I, IN FACT, did return the car within a 24 hour/1 day period. But Ryan left a distasteful place in my heart. I specifically wanted the car for 1 day. I know he was not “trying to be deceptive” However I told him I only wanted the car for 1 day....yet he printed the contract for 2 days “just in case I’m late. I’ve been with Avis for 10+ years. Don’t make executive decisions for me. Period.<//review>

AVIS in Hollywood Highland not really good cust. svc. 1st time i went, the customer svc. rep. Wendy even left my credit card out on the reception table when i excused myself to take personal call. i told her to excuse me for a while. Had another customer not catch my attention, someone could have gotten my ccard and drivers license.  2nd time i had to go there the Manager told me 'then why dont you go to that other Avis branch'. So i did, thank u for giving me that attitude i found a better branch. at this time everyone should be grateful that they are even employed and not give an attitude to customers. A lot of people would take your place if you are tired of working.<//text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>OMG..... This location introduced me to the renting industry. I rented my first car in March 2020. Tes was the front desk agent I spoke with on the phone so it brought me great comfort upon my arrival putting a face to the voice and speaking up right where I left off. He answered all my questions and simplified all my options debunking any confusion or anxiety  I would have about the process. The rates are superb, the selection is grand, and the service is top notch. Every time I enter the store Tes greets me with such warmth. I've found my rental family and has returned twice since, I actually just returned a month long rental a mere 2 days ago. Love this place and highly recommend this location.< /Review>< pics>

Rented an SUV last Friday. Ryan, AVIS guy, couldn't give me a good discount for the weekend. I'm a Preferred AVIS customer at that. Not ok.

The SUV was impressive, though.
Clean, inside and out. It had that brand-new-car smell.

Edgar, the cleaning guy in the parking lot,  was very courteous, friendly, smiled all the time, answered all my questions. Edgar is the kind of high-quality AVIS employee of my expectation.

IF the AVIS dude, at the counter, gave me a great discount, I'd give it a five-star rating.<//Text>

Friendly, efficient service.  Easy to set up the rental, & to pick up/drop off.  The car was easy to drive & in good condition.  Price was very fair.  Good location.< /Text>

The vehicle they provided was amazing and helped make our trip into a 10/10. Upon return, Ryan who was waiting, was equally helpful and professional.

watch your credit card, they overcharge.

i rented a car lately in Los Angeles, it was already pre-paid 5 month before, we told the guy that we dont want any insurance because we have already ours.
A couple days after while watching my bank accout i realised that they took  177$usd on my credit card without asking me, when i called back they told me that this money was to pay the insurance that i didnt wanted. And also they refuse to refund me completely... only had a skinny 30% of what they overcharged me... they are liars and steal people the legal way... dont make business with them</review>

Service at the Front Desk ? Even since Avis and Budget are together every time I reserve a car I choose Avis
I love when staff tell me about special  offers when I go to pick up the car I selected days before when the difference in price are minimum comparing the quality of the new car they give me last time I reserved a Nissan I ended up driving a Dodge Charger LOL
Perfect inventory to choose from
Insurance offers? very well explained
Cars? very clean
Paper Work?  So Fast when you already reserved 15 minutes max and you have the keys
Reliability? Pick one:  The Avis App or The Internet
Location?  I think business will improve if the office is at the sidewalk instead of hidden like in that building< /Text>

Wouldnt honour the car upgrade code saying they didnt have a car available. Offered me a bigger upgrade but at an extra charge. It seems obvious to me that the bigger upgrade shouldve been free if they ran out of cars and werent able to honour the deal but clearly the money comes before the customer satisfaction.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>(Translated by Google) In English: Beware of this provider. When picking up the car we said with several people at least 3x that we do not want to have additional insurance. Nevertheless, the clerk has built additional insurance in the contract, which must be signed digitally. Being in a hurry and trusting the agent, you quickly sign up, ignoring the capitalized options for these additional policies. When returning the car are then for each day about 10USD of additional services. As a European you have no chance to complain, so the money is gone.

In German:
Beware of this provider. When we picked up the car, we said at least 3 times with several people that we didn't want any additional insurance. Nevertheless, the clerk has built additional insurance into the contract, which has to be digitally signed. Since you are in a hurry and trust the clerk, you sign quickly and overlook the activated options for this supplementary insurance. When returning the car there are about 10USD of additional services for each day. As a European you have no chance to complain, so the money is gone.

Auf Deutsch:
Vorsicht vor diesem Anbieter. Bei der Abholung des Autos haben wir mit mehreren Personen mindetens 3x gesagt, dass wir keine Zusatzversicherung haben möchten.  Trotzdem hat der Sachbearbeiter Zusatzversicherungen in den Vertrag eingebaut, den man digital unterschreiben muss. Da man in Eile ist und dem Sachbearbeiter vertraut, unterschreibt man im Schnelldurchgang und übersieht dabei  die aktivierten Optionen für diese Zusatzversicherungen. Bei der Rückgabe des Autos stehen dann für jeden Tag ca. 10USD an Zusatzleistungen. Als Europäer hat man keien Chance zu klagen, somit ist das Geld weg.<//review></record>

< Review>
My favorite place to get a haircut at a reasonable price, the lady who does my line ups and tapers always offer's to trim up my eye brows too! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good barber and good pricing and overall friendly and welcoming atmosphere.< /Review>

Weekends are fairly busy but worth the wait in my opinion. So far I haven't  been disappointed in any of the barbers. This is one of the few barbers shops in the area I've actually does razor fades with straight razors. Old school barber shops are far and few now a days. This one definitely Give me that classis barber shop feeling.<//Text>

<Text>Very friendly place. Did a great job and they ask you questions to make sure they're getting it right. It can get busy so you need to sign in, and then wait outside for your name to be called. All the employees and customers are wearing masks and following COVID precautions.<//Text>< time>

Went here yesterday, excellent service! Sat down for a minute or two and it was my turn. Barbers are bilingual and very kind. The guy who cut my hair did a great job. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. Was $18 for my haircut.< /Review>

Great barbershop. Old school barbershop. Gabby helped and did a great job. She even offered to trim my eyebrows. They take your temperature before you go in, and they fully sanitize after every customer. I will be returning!< /text>

<review>I go here when I'm on vacation.  I pay $20.00 where I'm from in Northern California for a hair cut w/o tip.  It's about the same hair cut at about half of the price.  They shave my sideburns and back of my neck, same as my barber up north.  The conversations, employees and regulars is mostly in Spanish. I don't speak Spanish.  All barbers I've had, 'bout 3 different ones in 20 years spoke fluent English.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I used to go to this spot exclusively. The final straw for me was when I had to endure a barber cutting my hair who's breath smelled like manure. He was a big guy and was smelled extremely unpleasant. The only guy who had any talent there was the owner, the guy with a little mustache. His daughter, Vivi, (I believe, I saw her picture) is also the worst. She takes forever to cut your hair and doesn't even know how to yet I have to pay her like a professional. Worst fades. I will never return to this place and strongly urge everyone to go elsewhere. Overpriced, no talent, and absolutely disgusting. I would rather cut my hair myself.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1581955804495, 'text': 'Sorry for your bad experience but this person hasn’t been working here for over 6 years!'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

I dont like to make appointments this place always has good barbers that specializes in mens haircuts. I drive 20min just to get my haircut  with not more than 10min wait time.</Review>

Seems like Gustavo N. Is a fraud. Funny you posted about a barber "vivis" that hasnt worked there for over 3 years? Seems like you are a hateful person, I have been going to that shop for years. HANDS down best barbers in Chino for over 45YEARS!<//Review>

The layout of the place is simple and easy to get around in which I love since I get lost easily.

The Property Manager, Enrique Hernandez is INCREDIBLE!  Enrique’s customer service and professionalism is a major reason we will never leave this facility.

The facility is always clean, well cared for and we’ve never experienced any problems related to safety or security due to their superior service.

I highly recommend this outstanding facility and I especially recommend  Enrique Hernandez.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Renting a space was quick and easy. I rented it online and stopped by to sign the paperwork in person the day of.  It took around 10 minutes and the manager and staff took time to personally explain how to open the gate and walked me to the unit and patiently answered all my questions.</Review>

I received a payment receipt via email from him.  That is what prompted me to call him to discuss "why" I was receiving this email because I pay USStorage through my bank electronically.  We discussed both of us being confused and he told me he would go back in the ledger history and see if he could figure out what happened and get back to me by end of day.  Not only did he get back to me by end of day, he explained that at some point the bank was sending 2 payments a month for a period of time and that I had a credit balance!

I want to Thank You, Joan for going above and beyond what I normally expect in today's customer service world.  You are a great asset to the Torrance - Crenshaw team and I am grateful to you.</Text>< Pics>

I highly recommend US Storage in Torrance. There Manager Enrique Hernandez goes out of his way to help you in finding the best size to suite your storage needs. Marcia gave us a tour of a few units. The facility is very clean actually spotless and cared for and you can see that once you walk through. I was very satisfied with my choice and feel that my storage needs with be secure.
Excellent customer service and very helpful.<//Review>

<Review>If you are looking for the best storage facility in the South Bay/Torrance, CA you need to go see Enrique Hernandez at US Storage on Crenshaw Bl. In Torrance. The facility is safe, clean, secure, the staff provides great customer service is very attentive to our needs. Marcia helps us very quickly when we need any help. Additionally, they are very friendly to small business owners.<//Review>< Pics>

We have stored our fifth wheel RV at this location for many years. After a brief absence we returned to excellent customer service from Enrique. He was able to find a great spot for our RV and was very efficient in completing the paperwork and setting up our monthly auto pay. The facility is always neat and clean and the staff is very friendly.</review>

< review>
What i like about US storage centers is the location and the size of the storage space for what i pay. But what i really like is the great customer service provided by Bill and Robin. Bill's a dedicated and hard working manager that goes out of his way to answer any questions or concerns a customer might have. He takes pride in working hard and providing the best customer service that he can. Robin is like a ray of sunshine,always greeting the customer a warm smile and pleasant conversation. She does her best to make the customer feel happier leaving the storage facility then when they first came in. Bill and Robin have made me a trusting and loyal customer of US storage centers. Thanks Bill and Robin and keep up the great work.<//review>

My first time renting a storage unit. Was able to get the size I needed. Robyn, the manager, made the process really easy and straightforward; really friendly personality to deal with. Prices are totally reasonable. Will definitely use again if I need storage in the South Bay in the future.<//review>

Everyone was very friendly and efficient. The facilities are very clean and secure. They have Dolly's they will lend you while on property which is a nice added bonus. Most of all, the customer service is top notch. With a storage facility on every corner of every town, the competition is out there.. You have to have an edge to stand out and capture that customer.. At US Storage on Crenshaw, it is the service they provide to the customers. Cash is king in most cases, and yes they are competitive in their pricing as well. I would highly recommend this location.< /review>

<text>So far, everything is great.  I only rented with them about a month ago; but each time I have needed to access the unit, I have had no problems.  The hours are good and the facility is clean.  They will give you a truck to move in (not out) free of charge.  That was a big help.  They will also allow you to use their rolling metal cart.  The Internet price seemed competitive.  The walk-in rate was higher.<//text>< Rate>

<Review>I walked in here not really knowing what I was looking for or needed for a storage unit. Jennifer assisted me with a great smile and was really patient with me. She introduced me to the different options I had and prices as well. She welcomed all my questions and answered them promptly. With the information she provided me, I will be able to come back to this location and rent out the correct unit with out hesitation. Thank Jennifer :)</Review><gmap_id>0x80dd4af1dafa8345:0xaeae60b0934a2ee5</gmap_id>< username>

I just rented a unit and had a great experience. The process was easy and quick ... Manager Robyn is terrific, professional, and explained everything thoroughly. The location is easy to access and convenient, the whole place is sparkling clean (very important!) and, although I don't have expensive stuff, I still appreciate the facility's security system. A+++!<//Text>

<review>I recently rented a storage space at your Crenshaw Blvd store in Torrance from your manager Stephanie.  The experience was totally satisfying and professional.  Stephanie helped us find the right size locker, she gave us a look inside, she helped us get access to a box truck to move our things, and she stayed over her lunch break to make sure we got everything done we needed to.  Stephanie showed great care and help to us, and we are so appreciative of her excellent service and care.  I will strongly recommend US Storage Centers to my friends looking for storage space in the future.  Please pass on our compliments to Stephanie!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd4af1dafa8345:0xaeae60b0934a2ee5< /gmapID></record>

I recently purchased a new motorhome and looked around for a local storage facility.  I was totally impressed when I spoke to Bill over the telephone and when I stopped in I was equally impressed by Robyn.  The rates are somewhat higher than other places, but the location and quality of the facilities is great.  Nice size parking sites that are spotless!  But the most impressive thing about this place is Robyn and Bill.</Review>

Thus far my dealings with US STORAGE CENTER, Torrance, Ca, has been good. When I've called or gone there my experience has been painless. The Manager Robyn(sp) has always been VERY HELPFUL and friendly. Everyone in the office is approachable. Which is great for me 😎😉 thanks Gertie H</text>

Love them. Storage unit is safe and clean!
Highly recommended. By the way I visited other location. I did not like it at all. They never even opened the door (I had appointment too!)

I was storing at a Public Storage in Pasadena and I figured that's as nice as it could get for a storage. When I moved to Torrance I still needed a space for some seasonal stuff so I checked out this place and a huge difference. I mean aside from being convenient with being on the first floor, the managers are great. Bill really took the time to show me around and pick the perfect spot for me. He was very friendly and got me set with with my access and all. If you're in the area this is the place to go!< /Review>< pics>

This location is convenient, clean and very secure. I had been a very happy customer of US Storage on Crenshaw in Torrance from 2010-2014 and had recently moved away. After 9 months I have returned and am so happy that Robin and Bill are still running a fantastic operation. Signed up again and received great service from Reyna upon checking in.</Review>

<username>Herbert Roberts<//username><date>1415860002455</date><rating>5</rating><review>We store our 36 foot Motor Home RV at this US Storage facility.  We have been there almost 2 years now.  We are very pleased with our experiences, and have no regrets or disappointments.  The managers, Robin and Bill, are always cooperative, cheerful and accommodating to our needs.  The facility is always clean, the code operated gates have never been out of order, access is very efficient, and we have always felt the facility is very safe and secure. Before leasing our space we researched extensively around the South Bay.  While this Center is not the least nor the most expensive available, we believed that  it was best to pay a bit more to achieve peace of mind and assurance that our RV investment will be quite secure and safe.  We are pleased to recommend this facility to anyone looking for a clean, secure, well managed storage center.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I am shopping around for my work inventory. Robyn the store manager helped me out and showed me a few options as to what would fit not only my needs but my budget too. She was very professional and very friendly. Ive been to Public storage and they are not friendly at all.She answered all of my questions and really wanted to earn my business. Im definitely coming back to rent. Great location, price is right and very good staff. Kudos to Robyn for running an amazing location.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><rating>5</rating>< name>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>The facility is clean.
The layout is straightforward.
Security is reassuring.
The manager here is friendly.
The company will bend over backwards to help accommodate you.
The prices here are a bit higher than competitors, but starting specials are helpful for short-term rental, and the overall experience makes the slightly higher cost well worth it.  If you are looking for a quality storage facility instead of an indoor beehive maze or trashy abandoned parking lot feeling outdoor, then this is the place.
Also, because it is important to some, and something I appreciated, he facility has a clean restroom and cold drinking water...oh, and candy, but that may have been a Halloween thing.< /Text>< resp>

< Review>
I reserved a space by phone in April, I was moving from Virginia to Torrance, Calif.     Robin helped me set up the transition she was very helpful. Gave me a competitive price for 3 months of 99.00 monthly, I went in the office on the 14th of May to pay for the first month but when I arrived I found out there was also a 20.00 administration charge that I was not told about and the prorated amount I had to pay for the 17 days I had left in the month of may was not calculated by the amount I was paying a month, it was considerably more but I paid it.  My boxes arrived the 19th and I moved my stuff in and realized I could use a smaller size it was less than 1/2 full so I  asked about downsizing was told no problem but the price was only 17.00 less a month than what I was paying for double the size. I was hoping she would understand the situation and work with me. I have rented storage spaces before and they always work with you because they want your business and am sure want you to be happy you are a customer there and not somewhere else. but no she was not going to help this situation at all. I thought about it for a few days. Then paid my rent for June and went back  in  deciding to go ahead and change sizes  we started the paperwork and then she told me I would have to pay another 20.00 administration fee for the different unit.....give me a break! I had only been there for just over 2 weeks all the info was the same. That was it, I said no thank you and  I went to my storage unit and loaded my car, with 2 trips I was out (see that's how little boxes I had they all fit into my Honda civic). I'm sorry I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have no mind to spending any amount of money. If you are on a budget don't bother.< /Review>

Clean facilities, easy access to units, and a helpful staff. Does  cost more than some other close storage facility's though at US Storage it's hassle free with not stairs, no elevators,  no long endless walks to your storage.  All units are ground floor, some with direct outside access.<//text>

Great service everytime, I had things here before in 2010 and always felt safe and didn't worry about a thing. Robin and Bill are the best. I was having issues getting to the site this time and everytime I call and told them I would be late they where always very understanding.

Thanks guys.

Thanks so much guys.</Review>

I like that I can drive up to my bay door of my unit and Un load or organize my unit.  There are lights that you can turn on inside your unit at night. I love the security gate as well.  You can key your code in during the exit or enter of guest in front of you with out waiting for the gate to close again.
The staff are awesome.  They have lots of packaging supplies for sale at the office.  There is a bathroom too..during office hours. It's clean as well. This is My 2nd time renting space.<//Review>

Robyn is extremely nice, accomadating, and even brings my own Buisness more Buisness with a great personality to go along with it, if you need a storage lot for your stuff or a parking spot for any of your vehicle's call Robyn at US Storage.</review>

I ordered lobster rolls and was not satisfied with the quality. My rolls kept on unrolling and I had to reroll it myself to put food in my mouth. I wish they took a little extra effort to prep the rolls before serving. Also, while the place is tiny, you have to stand in line to pay the bill. It just didn't make sense why not to pay it while seated. The ambience is relaxing somewhat but the little details mentioned above overrule the overall experience. Sorry.< /text>

Great little place.

They have plenty of parking due to the lot and the food is reasonably priced. They have a lot of seating areas if you choose to dine in as well.

Stop by! I definitely think you’ll like it.<//text>

I LOVE fried chicken and I've never heard of a Japanese fried chicken, other than karage, so I had to try this place out. However, I don't think this is for everyone...I'd rather eat karage then eat this. I don't mean to hate on this place, but I feel like you either love or hate this place.<//Text>

<user_name>Ms Kharrazi<//user_name><date>1583519402643</date><Review>Usually I’d give San Sai 5 stars because I love the Oriental salad with the shrimp tempura and veggies. But my last visit was not good . The Restraunt smelled bad, you know how when you open the door to a place and it smells like good fresh cooked food? Ya, that didn’t happen, it was musty and everywhere seemed a little dirty. The front door was broken. It was stuffy. But that smell! It stayed in my nose for hours.

The food was still good but I had to order to go.</Review>< rate>

I really enjoy the shrimp tempura and tempura vegis.

The  temp. melon has a great taste and the orange salad comes with the BEST  balsamic vinegar!

The behind the counter fellows are quite stonefaced and unfriendly....the girls on the other hand rock and keep a cleaner space.< /review>

It's a nice, and simple Japanese restaurant with decent sushi. Prices are fair, and food is good. Not a top prime sushi place but for the price is actually good, and portions are decent too. Combo plates are the rest ask you can several side items along side the sushi/meat/tempura.  Definitely recommend if you want something fast to eat or are on a quick lunch.<//text>

<Review>I love this place for a quick bite of sushi and udon. Although if you expecting quality sushi then you'll need to go somewhere else. This is a fast food restaurant. You order at the counter and 5 min later they have your order on a tray. I don't know of anywhere else in the area where you can have sushi for lunch and still make it back to work on time.</Review><UserId.>105402508862380922650</UserId.><Rate>5</Rate><resp>None</resp><time>1552120723813<//time><user_name>Damian Lavalle< /user_name><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb487adfca99:0x968b7962f7ced1fb<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Any other day I would have given them 5 stars. Everything is delicious and the prices are great for the amount of food you get. However today there was hair in my California roll. The woman asked if I'd like another one made but I asked for a refund seeing that my appetite is gone. She refunded the money for my food and not my drink. No worries the orange soda was good.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I took one of my buyer clients out for dinner here. It was nice, I love a good fast food teriyaki restaurant! The prices were very good for the food I was getting. I got the teriyaki chicken plate and the chicken noodles.
Their plates are significant, and they have a small salad bar that always grabs my attention.  But the chicken was great, the amount of chicken and rice I received was very satisfying especially for the cost.

<Review>Embarradas con chicarone in green Chile with an extra tortilla! Woooooweeeee! SO SO SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  This woman's food is off the charts and I'm a Hispanic girl from strong Mexican food cooking!  My number one restaurant on the planet for her food alone, but the place offers an interesting variety of artifacts and trinkets from days past to feast your eyes on and remember days gone by.....I 100% recommend this place to everyone that has taste buds that enjoy being delighted.</Review><Date>1622302055669< /Date><userid>103559224732555484750<//userid><Name>Towanda Rocks</Name><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

<Text>So delicious! This is an authentic Mexican gem. They only operate from early hours of the morning till 1pm.. And that's what make them authentic. They are known for their embarradas de chicharron con chile which is a hand made corn tortilla with refried beans and handmade chicarrones con chile Verde. So delicious. The feel of the place is so authenticn and has a homey feel to it. I love this place❤<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFyNgNDeXWGhdq4k7ivFBl9OXLTmF-ueEQ1FnO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Just try the embarradas in the morning at 6:30am. The embarradas taste better in the morning.  Make this place never go away. Go tomorrow morning, and enjoy.</Review>

I always wanted to stop by this place and it was really good and pleasent atmosphere, I order a Cicharron burrito a what a delicious burrito!!! Very simple made, Beans and meat, the way burritos should be made, the customer can add the salsa if they want, also prices are very fair, I will recommend it to anyone 100%, thumps up to everyone at Azteca.</review>

Delicious Chile relleno asada burritos. One of a kind! Great balance of cheese and meat along with a semi spicey Chile all wrapped in a flour tortilla. All made from scratch. Authentic delicious Mexican food!<//text>

Las enbarradas de chicharones are simply the best. Hands down a true legit Mexican food at its best (real hand made tortillas. Frijoles
Salsa that knocks your socks off in flavor and the spicy one is a true pico de gallo.< /text>

<text>Few people know there's no such thing as a Burrito in Mexico so if you have an opportunity to visit this beautiful country and stop by for a bite at a local restaurant and happen to order one they'll serve you exactly what I had for brunch at La Azteca. A giant hand made corn tortilla filled with refried beans and your choice of Chicharron (Thick cut deep fried Pork rinds w/meat), Chile Rojo or Verde (Red or Green Sauce w/Pork or Beef) topped with avocado, and Pico de Gallo folded resembling an extra large taco... Fabulous! Oh and you'll definitely want an ice cold Cidral ( Apple Cider) to go with it, enjoy!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>Just thought I'd mention if you value your bank account don't go here. If mommy and daddy pay your credit card bills, sure why not? It's conveniently located thats about the only positive I can see.  I called here to get some quotes on stuff that they said would be $1000 in labor for. Didn't seem right to me at all and I know a thing or two about cars.  Found several other shops that were between $350-$500 in labor for what I needed done (aka, the real price).  What a joke. Instead of offering a fair price they lost a customer that owns 5 luxury cars and could have given them thousands and thousands a year in business. Sucks to suck!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Jon and the guys at Coast Motor Werk are the best in the business. They keep my 2010 328xi running like new... always honest with what repairs are "needed ASAP" and what we can keep an eye on (to help keep costs manageable). If you're looking for a reputable repair shop with technicians that are masters of their craft, then look no further!<//Review>< pics>

I took my car in here for the first time recently expecting an expensive repair and was very pleasantly surprised by their straightforward honesty and level of customer service. They realized it was only a minor issue and took care of it quickly and at a very fair price. They also texted me updates explaining exactly what the issues were and what time they would be done by. I would definitely recommend this shop to a friend.<//text>

The check engine light on my 09 Mini Cooper S had turned on.  According to the cluster the car was overheating.  I love driving my R56 but I know how finicky they can be, I knew finding a good Mini mechanic shop was key.  I found James and Coast Motor Werk through Yelp and I am so happy I did.  James was very transparent and fair from the beginning.  I literally called Coast Motor Werk at 8am towed over my mini at 8:30 went to work and got a call at 11am.  They had diagnosed everything and had a final out the door price over the phone.  James had 2 Minis in the past and he gave me advice on some general and specific Mini advice.  I am so happy with their work and professionalism! Thank you guys!!</review>

<review>I've been here a couple times.  Each time I've received terrific service.  Derek and the team have been very helpful.  They're willing to discuss details and try to help you troubleshoot (basics) over the phone.  They're quick with a quote or to offer suggestions.  Their prices are better than the dealer (no surprise), but as best I can tell their work is just as good if not better.  I'm very happy with Coast Motor Werk and will keep coming back.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>if you own a BMW than this is the place to have your maintenance and repairs done. These guys are awesome, and there attention to detail is unmatched. I have been going here for 3 years and I am glad I found them.  The pricing is cheaper than the dealers, and the service quality is as good or better. Thanks Coast Motor Werk, for taking great care of my BMW. Paul</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Coast Motor Werk has always been great about providing wonderful service and is always very patient and helpful.  You can ask them any questions about your car and they will always answer it or be more than happy to show you.  For example, one of my tires split and I wanted to see it, they were patient to show it to me and better explain what happened.  They are also very good about giving you a heads up on future costs that they anticipate will be needed so you can budget or decide how you financially want to address it.  Very considerate and customer oriented!<//Text>< pics>

BMW repairs here were very cost efficient and I was so happy to have done business with them.  I looked every where for a decent BMW repair shop and am so glad I stumbled into this company.  It's much better than any BMW dealer.  They're personal and really seemed to care about their clients.  Thanks<//review>

<Text>Besides the friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere and clean bathrooms.... I never get that same feeling you get from other shops.. You know the kind where you are pressured into doing extra recommendations or else your car will die.  They tell me what is needed and the level of urgency, and that's it.  Very helpful when it comes to questions and not arrogant even though they are the experts.<//Text>< Pictures>

Ever since my warranty expired on my 2006 BMW 530i, I have used Coast Motor Werk for any work required. They have been consistently excellent and honest in dealing with me, they do not try to upsell me any non-essential services and they charge a fair price, especially compared to other BMW car repair places I have checked out. They know what they are doing and have been able to fix any issues I might have. It also helps that I live in the same city and it is easy to reach their shop. I will continue to use their services as long as I have a BMW.<//text>

<review>I needed a reputable place to get my 09 Mini Cooper during work, hours. CMW is in the area their reviews were very encouraging.
I made an appointment for early the next morning and took the car in. They did a great job of replacing the oil for a price far less than the dealer wanted. Its not as cheap as those oil-change oil places but the peace of mind is worth the extra $$.

After the diagnostic, they also let me know about a few other future maintenance items I should keep in mind, but they didn't pressure me into having the work done. Good experience and I've already gone back for the next visit.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I came to Coast Motor Werk a few years ago. Crevier did something that gave me the impression they were ripping me off. I had about a year left on an extended warranty on both our BMW's. A neighbor of mine recommended Coast, so I gave it a shot and have been incredibly happy ever since. Everyone at the shop is wonderful and they do a terrific job, but it all starts with Derek at the front desk. He has been my lifesaver on many occasions.< /text><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>The service at Coast Motor Werk's is outstanding. The people are knowledgeable, friendly, and always professional. I am confident that my car will be serviced as requested and their added service of drop-off and pick-up is tremendously helpful.< /Text>< time>

Brad at Coast Motor Werks has always done an amazing job on my car. Great service, reliable work, and amazing customer service. Prices are amazing for the work they do, and the team takes care of its customer better than your local dealership. I recommend for anyone who owns a BMW, or a Mini. They really do an amazing job every time!<//Text>

The guys at this shop are all nice and competent.  I highly recommend anyone to come and try this experience.  I went to another shop before and paid an excessive amount of money which did not take care of the problem.  They diagnosed the problem right away.  If you are looking for a better experience I recommend that you try Coast Motor Werk's.<//text>

<text>This is the only place anyone should get any work done on their BMWs! I drive a 2007 3 series and Coast Motor Werk is honestly the only place I ever go and the only guys I trust to touch my car. They've never let me down since the first time I went in and have been nothing less than perfect with all the work on my boyfriend's BMW as well. Their shop is really clean, super professional, and overall very nice! They also always have everything done in a timely manner.<//text>< Pics>

All the Coast Motor Werk shops are the best I have worked with. I had a failing mini cooper 2003 and they brought it back to life many times. My Dad is a mechanic out of the area and he confirmed that their prices were right on. They were even very kind and at the end when told me that it was no longer worth repairing. I appriciate their honesty!< /text>

<text>I needed a place to get my 09 Mini Cooper S serviced while I was at work, and this is the only place in the area that looked trust worhty at all.

I called in and made an appointment for early in the morning the next week and took the car in.  They did a great job of replacing the oil for a price far less than the dealer wanted.  Its not as cheap as those oil-change oil places but if you're driving a Mini Copper you should care about your car enough not to take it to those kind of places.

They also let me know about a few other future maintenance items I should keep in mind, but they didn't pressure me into having the work done.  My car has a recalled water pump and Derrick gave me the recall number for the work and let me know the dealer will replace it at no cost.

Good experience and I will be going back.

<review>These guy are over price, don't know jackshit, and won't have anything to do with a slightly modded car. Their service may come with a smile, but that's only because you're a sucker. F these guys. They almost make me prefer a dealer.< /review>< Pics>

I have a 2004 545i with Sport Package. I have all the services done at Coast Motor Werk Irvine since 2010 and totally satisfied. They know exactly what's wrong with my car. They fixed the problem on time with a reasonable price. The place is clean. All the mechanists are professional and friendly.< /Review>

<Review>I have had my 2002 BMW Z3 serviced at CMW Irvine for over three years and could not be happier.  Everything from online reservations to the ready-when-promised delivery are first rate.  The rates are competitive and, typically, less than the dealership service center.  Glad to have found these guys and happy to be a longtime customer.  The icing on the cake is the annual Beer, Brats and BMWs festival at the Huntington Beach location.  These guys really know how to spoil you!<//Review>< user_name>

But the real reason I always return is the honest and professional nature of everyone.  There are no attempts at unnecessary upsells or "extra" repairs for the sake of their profits - an experience I always had when I took my Mini to the BMW dealership.  In fact, I had an extended service contract with the dealership, but I stopped going because I like Coast Motor Werks so much more.

Fixing a BMW or Mini is never cheap, but this has been the best experience I've ever had with a repair shop.<//Text>< time>

Began using CMW once my maintenance warranty expired.  Clean shop, courteous staff and honest.  Used the Irvine shop a few times until the RSM shop was opened and have been very pleased with both operations.  Would definitely recommend.<//text>

<text>I can't say enough about how awesome these guys are.  Not only are they skilled at what they do, but they went above and beyond with my car service.  They even fixed a  few things for free that I didn't ask them to.  How often do you hear that story from a Car Service provider?  My experience is almost never... except for these guys.  If you like your BMW, do yourself a favor and save both time and money vs going to the dealer.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Derrick and the gang at CMW are awesome. The shop is clean, people are friendly, and service there doesn't come with the "just ripped off" feeling you get at the dealer.
I've already refereed a few friends, and I'll continue to do so.<//review>< Pictures>

We have two BMWs, both 3 series convertibles, one ragtop and one hardtop.  We're a little more conservative on the older model as my son and I work on the car together, but need outside assistance at times.  I appreciate a balanced view on what is needed, when and what are my options.  My wife's car needs to be treated a little more seriously, without being taken advantage of.  I really appreciated how they identified that the rear tires we about to blow, due to a fine line wear pattern caused by the extreme factory alignment.  The rear tire tread looked great, other than this small line that was worn to the steel threads.  I need a shop I can trust and the team here has done a very good job in building that confidence.  I don't hesitate to call them first!<//Review>

Have a 2008 528i and have taken my car there for one year. So far, the guys at CMW have been fair with me and their recommendations and costs are in line with other shops. They give tell you what you need and don't need. After all, a mechanic is about trust. Also, these guys are generally nice people and they are Beemer Guys.</text>

I recently came out of factory warranty on my BMW M3. After searching for a non dealer service provider I decided on Coast Motor Werk. I've always had very good service at my BMW dealer so the bar was set high. Hands down CMW is the best service experience I've ever had in 30 years of owning and servcing various european automobiles. Great pricing, friendly, trustworthy, highly competent staff.<//Review>

<text>I recently purchased a pre-owned 2008 E90 M3 and after a poor experience with Irvine BMW, I elected to try Coast Motor Werk in Irvine, CA. I am glad that I followed the recommendation of a co-worker and the onlnie reviews I'd seen because I had an excellent experience and will be back for all my service needs going forward. I worked with George and found him professional, knowledgable and very customer friendly with regular updates and follow up. The shop is clean, open and staffed with real professionals who know the brand and are focused on providing the proper care for your car. I highly recommend Coast Motor Werk - Irvine for any/all your BMW needs< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< review>
Trustworthy technicians & quality workmanship!  I had been to CMW a couple of times previously & was impressed with their service, so when the powersteering on my 2003 Mini went out I took it there. They told me the powersteering was still under warranty & the dealer should fix it for free (they could have done the work & charged me - I wouldn't have known any better). The dealer replaced the powersteering pump (no charge), then gave me a laundry list of expensive repairs that they said I should have done. I took the list and my Mini back to CMW, and was told that only one of the repairs was needed & at 2/3 the cost of the dealership quote. Quick, professional, honest, courteous service & a shuttle to and from work included! THANK YOU!!<//review>

Joe did a really great job. He asks and listens to you properly and even focus on minor details . He spent almost an hour on my beard and hair. Really impressed. It's worth trusting them with your hair. It's best with an appointment already made.<//Review>

It's great if you want a fade. I'm a white man. No racism intended. As a rule I don't ever have my hair faded. I saw 4 men giving the same haircut. It was a really good fade but it is not what I asked for and I'm not down with looking like a gang banger or a hip-hop sag my pants type person. The only bling I wear is a military rosary. Now I have to shave off a 60 dollar haircut (tip was included)

<Review>I want to thank Ivan again for a great job he did for my brother. My brother is in a convalescent facility. I called the Groomsmen on a Friday and ask if one of the men could go to where my brother is at and if they would do it on a Monday i thought they would say no but that didn't even happen The gentlemen on the phone said that it  should not be a problem let me ask one of the guys. Now we all know that barber 's and beautician usually do not work on Monday but he got back on the phone and said yes Ivan would be more than happy to do it. I met Ivan where my brother is at. He was great he treated my brother as if he was in a barber shop , taking to him and making him feel comfortable. He did a great job on my      brothers beard and his  hair believe me my brother need it , it has not been done since September. Again Thank You to The Groomsmen and Ivan for your service i will be recommended The Groomsmen to everyone:-)< /Review></record>

they do NOT need your business PERIOD!
I've tried a couple times to try this place's haircuts and I got rejected twice.
what kind of business does not welcome walk-ins? it feels like they are doing you a big favor, or cutting your hair for free...
i walked in at 7:10 PM and nobody was down to give me a haircut. it says on google that they're open until 9... they kicked me out nicely.
the second day I call at 6:25 PM and ask if somebody can  take me right now, and they simply put me on hold for a minute then answer me with negativity. saying i should book using the app.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT APP HE IS TALKING ABOUT.
I'm just disappointed and never trying again. that's not somebody I'd trust with my hair.< /Text>

<review>It’s a pleasure to use this laundromat because it’s reasonably priced and generally clean and managed well by the staff. Mask 😷 wearing is enforced and I always see the young guy that works there cleaning and making sure customers are happy. There’s a new ATM inside the laundromat and you can get access to the bathroom. There’s also a hand wash basin if you need to wash your hands, since we are in the middle of a Covid-19 pandemic.
This is a great little laundromat on Freeport Blvd opposite Marie’s Donuts, Ten Acres Pharmacy and Taylor’s Market.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Clean space and clean machines. This is a fairly big laundromat with plenty of washers and dryers. Two rows of top load, a row of 2-load, two rows of 3-load, a few 4-load, a few 6-load, and a couple 8-load. Lots of smaller dryers and several larger sized with a few huge sized (each $0.25 per 6 min). I've never had trouble parking. The only downside is the machines are quarter only, but there is an atm there.</Review>< date>

The most wonderful place to do your laundry at.  There is always an attendance around. You don't have to feel scared at night doing your laundry because the people that run the place makes it a point to say hi.</text>

This laundromat has got to be the cleanest laundromat I've ever been to. Plenty of machines and plenty of parking. Tuesdays are the best day to come in.< /text>

<Time>1599529617340< /Time><text>This laundry use to be very clean all the time suddenly after the remodel it started to decay. I was in today and some washers had soap gunk; they had not been continuously wipe down. The floor was dirty and it hadn’t been mopped throughout the day. I noticed a couple of the top loads smelled of dirty standing water. The carts are very dirty on the bottom it make me very hesitant to put my clean clothes in them after drying.
At first sight when you walk in it may look fine but as you start doing your laundry you notice this things. I wanted to make the attendant aware but He seemed so passive watching the tv at times and walking around here and there that it made me feel it would be pointless so i will go to a different laundromat rather besides the fact that this area is starting to become too crowded with roaming addicts; while I was there a guy with no shirt walked in. He was extremely stuck I thought he was going to snap in there but the attendant said something to him and he stormed out; so yeah I would not feel safe in there anymore even tho I use to like this laundromat because everything was very clean and it was quiet.</text>< Rating>

The place is clean. The prices are reasonable--better than where i live-- so i come here instead. The machines are working well and they keep them clean, too. It's close to my apt., the attendants are politely friendly, there's plenty of parking, the Freeport Bakery and Marie's Donuts are across the street--oh, and now there's a new coffee shop that's giving Starbucks a run for its money (also across the street.) I'm sure I'm going to find something i don't like. But honestly, for all the reasons stayed above, it will have to be something major for me to stop going there.< /Text>

Humans are good! Seriously! They saved the items I left in a dryer over a week! Exhausted, post-camping, and I haven't used a laundromat in years. This clean, friendly business and this guy saved us so much stress and made us so happy! Favorite camping flannel is back! Fantastic. Clean clothes and a happy heart!<//Review>

<text>Very very clean and the nicest attendants!! Just be aware that this is an old school laundromat so you need to come with quarters or paper money to use in the change machine. Many of the laundromats today are able to take ATM or debit cards. But this is a nice little Clean laundromat that's worth the extra effort to make sure you have change to do your wash!</text>< Pictures>

Some of best prices for laundry in Sacramento City area & consistency in operations, cleanliness and HELPFUL staff members. Overall, where I go week after week for these reasons and I absolutely recommend to anyone.<//text>

The place is pretty clean. Nice people too. Only problem is you don't get your money back right away if the dryer doesn't work. You would have to get it back on your next visit. What if that was the last of my quarter. Do I have too go home with wet clothes?< /review>

I used the $8 washing machine, this washer fits 8 big loads and its BIG. As soon as i paid for it i pressed my water tempature i wanted and then the green start button it washed for 24 min and my cloths came out smelling good.  Clean place and they have a change machine for you incase you need more quarter's, they also sale single load soap and dryer sheets, big laundry bags, fabric softner. They also have a bathroom and No Wi-Fi wich sucks but they have 1 cable t.v and a vending machine full of chips,candy,cookies and soda. Theres also a doughnut shop across the street and a McDonald's diretly across the parking lot just incase you get hungry while waiting for your laundry.< /text>

We have come to Freeport laundry for over 8 years. People working have always been very nice and polite.  Tonight I saw a new face,
a women who locked eyes with me leaned  into my face and shouted "WE CLOSE AT 10, Y0U GOT THAT!" As I placed my clothes in a washer at 9pm. Other people were YELLING BACK that they got it and to chill. I really felt like leaving at that point. I've never felt such tension at this business, and it really made me feel UNWELCOMED. Crazy how big of a impact staff treating customers makes the atmosphere and overall experience at that business. Definitely NOT RETURNING.<//Review>

My favorite laundromat in Sacramento. The owners are super nice and the other guy they employ is cool as well. Washer and Dryers work well and there are plenty of baskets. 1 food and drink vending machine, a change machine, and a soap/dryer sheet dispenser. There's a moderately sized parking lot with a car wash next door.<//text>

<Text>My friend and I were charged $8.90 each for a cherry pastry and a mocha coffee. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our order, and the place wasn't busy. The pastries were in the deli counter, and coffee just shouldn't take that long. After finally getting our orders, the pastry was so so at best, but the Mocha sucked. We tried adding cocoa powder, sugar, and more sugar, and more and more cream just to make it drinkable. It didn't help. For $9.00 and a 30 minute wait, the coffee and pastry should have been perfect, or at least drinkable. Don't waste your time or money at this place. Too many good coffee houses to choose from without wasting your time.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCAYM-vWMyhm9ceifwyuozdpgUXNF07-QDQCU7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1rHW41JS3heDLKkuiFjjxK-s0ccfrKnPX6JvJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsgAj_EpbmDRLmaJDu7ikaVlIN7oD8rjxBB-cv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Beautiful,  bright,  nice energy.  It's a great stop fur a sandwich while in the Banning area. It's under new ownership with a young couple.  It is obvious that they care and are putting their hearts and souls into the success of the shop as well as assuring quality products are being served.
The coffee was also awesome!<//Text>

I've tried to use Groupon coupon with them but they totally redone the deal and tried to scam me. Moreover if they won't take down this promo from Groupon or correct it I'm gonna sue that place.</text>< date>

For what it is, a place for a good coffee and comfort food, it doesn't get better...especially when just traveling through on the 10.

It had a Christian undertone, but didn't bother me. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what was playing on the radio.

Will definitely hit this place up on my trips through.< /review>

The smell in the establishment is quite unpleasant. The workers are friendly but very slow. Waited maybe 30 ish minutes for two coffees and ONE waffle. The waffle by its self being roughly 8 dollars. The food was honestly not the best for the price :\ would not recommend.< /text>

Bomb coffee! Their Cappuccinos is my favorite, & their breakfast is a must if your going to eat. The staff is really friendly as well.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>This place needs a makeover desperately. Their coffee is weak & expensive 3.29 for house coffee. The pastry was dry & slathered in extra icing which I did not ask for. It was as if they were trying to cover for the staleness of the pastry. They also need to improve their coffee bar, I felt like I was in a cafeteria because of the coffee mate creamers & half & half containers with the most basic sugar & lack of straws & napkins.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I had an amazing experience here! Monty cut my hair and it was such a great experience, I live a little far but it was definitely worth the drive. If you're looking for a really friendly and inclusive space to get your hair done, definitely come here :)< /text>

Pony has been cutting my hair for 20 years. He’s the only one I trust with not only the exact precise cut I want but also with the unique amazing color. You can show him photos you want and get it to the exact replication. Or he will tell you when your type of hair can’t replicate and modify to what your hair can do. OR just come in with a concept or feeling of what you want to achieve and BOOM a haircut you didn’t even know you wanted! Bottom line - whatever you want Pony can deliver. It’ll probably be even better TBH. So do yourself a favor, book with him today!< /text>

Such an incredible experience! The team made me feel very welcome & comfortable. David tailored a cut to my wishes & my face which came out better than I could've imagined! For the 1st time in years I love my hair! I highly recommend Folklore Salon!< /Review>

Took me a year of living in LA to find a barbershop that excels in short cuts for women. Brie is an extremely creative and experienced stylist who flows with my hair and crazy schedule🙊 I am so appreciative of her. To go to a salon that cares about inclusivity and true diversity of humans, hair, and community is amazing. So lucky to have found them!</text>

<text>She is very knowledgeable about new trends and products and what works great with my very fine, limp hair. I always leave looking great and feeling better. Her skills are magic!The salon is upbeat, very clean, welcoming and located in the heart of LoHi.  Would give 6 stars if I could. Give Veronica a try, you will not be disappointed!</text>< Pics>

I live right up the street from Folklore Salon and didn't even know that it was there until I did a search on G+. I am so glad that I found it! I went to Pony and got a haircut. She was great. She took the time to talk about what I wanted from my haircut and it totally paid off. My haircut looks fantastic and it is exactly what I wanted. The salon is very comfortable and the shampoo was great. They bring you your beverage of choice and you're free to relax while you get beautified. I strongly recommend this great new salon and my new favorite stylist, Pony.</text>

<text>I needed a haircut when I was visiting LA, and found this gem located in Echo Park. Booking online was quick and easy. Brie was awesome, she was very friendly and so are the rest of the staff. I’m really satisfied with the cut, price was pretty reasonable for LA. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with them, just a little out of the way from dtla. I’d come back to this salon if I’m in LA again.<//text><time>1559324357681</time></record>

Nice location and easy to get an appointment.  Called in 3 days ahead and was able to book a cut with someone. Cute set up inside. Their waiting area is in the back. I had some issues finding parking on the street so give yourself time to find some. They were great on giving me recommendations on color for my next visit and suggesting conditioners for my colored hair. Bought one of their brands and has worked wonders so far! No hassles here so will be back!</review>

I had a great experience here with Sunni. She has cut my hair in the past and she always does a wonderful job, but this time I felt like adding some color after years of being brunette. Although I'm pretty bad at describing what I want when it comes to hair, somehow she was able to interpret and gave me exactly what I wanted. She's very talented and passionate about her craft. Not only did I walk out feeling amazing, Sunni even took the time to write down a list of things for me to do to help get my hair in better health. Very pleased.< /review>

This is the CUTEST salon off of Ventura! Such friendly people, and great energy! Cynthia did wonders on my hair, I could not be happier! I would recommend this spot 1000000% If you're looking to switch things up, Mane Fixation is a place to try first :)<//review>

<text>Everything about this place is perfection. Pony and the team really know how to make a safe, inclusive, Good Vibes kind of place. Everyone is welcome here (unless you're trying to start trouble or hate on people then it's best to go somewhere else). The team is highly skilled in everything from standard cuts to chic and cool to barber shop styles to coloring and more! Support your local queer business!<//text>< pics>

<text>Fun, queer friendly spot. I came here after a long search for a place that would “get” short hair for women. You do have to book appointments pretty far in advance (eg, not day of) in general, but once you’ve got a spot, get ready to have the best haircut of your life!

Amazing!! It's a bit more expensive than what I would usually want to spend on my hair, but it's totally worth it. If you are lgbtq or gender non-conforming, treat yourself to a totally affirming and stress-free haircut experience. Krylon specializes in curly hair!< /text>

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these folks !  First off, customer service is always top notch - they are always wonderfully accommodating . I've always been happy with my blow-out services and I just received color from Bri - she did such a gorgeous job ! The color was perfect for my skin tone, which is genius in itself,  and the color is rich and beautiful . My blow out following my color was with Dana - It was perfect ! Cheers to you Cinta, for running an awesome business !</Text>

The drinks are fantastic, the food is delicious, and the view is breathtaking. We have the Rum Ginger and Bloody Mary drinks, all of which are fantastic, with great presentation and an unforgettable drinking experience. John, our waiter, was excellent. He sent us a long list of delicious cocktail ideas. He elevated our journey to new heights.<//Text>

excellent provider. fair pricing. a laugh environment. surely loved the high Rib dinner, cooked flawlessly to medium rare. Peanut butter Jameson shot for dessert became really worth a attempt - dangerous due to the fact they're definitely tasty.</text>

Went there today- service left a great deal to be desired. We were given one price on the menu scanned from the table and then overcharged 12 dollars. When we asked the manager said "yeah those are old prices" and said he took $5 off. He didnt- my credit card was charged the original amount- One member of our party was told by the server to go figure out beer selections on his own - server said what we ordered was dark and it was light- too many terrible things to say about service and underhanded charges here. The food was good- 2 sandwiches and our beer should have been 32 based on based on actual advertised prices- we paid 46. If you like underhanded charges with no straight answers this is the place for you.<//text>

So Happy that this place was able to stay open during the Pandemic.

2for1 Happy Hour Drinks will have you stumbling down Hollywood BLVD.

Make a stop here during a Bar Crawl or Pre-Game before a Hookah Lounge cool down.</text>

< Review>
We enjoy to go out. Yesterday we arrived in this superb place which friends told us about. We spent a lovely evening there with fine meal and a courteous crew and a great chief cook. We  added this venue in our phone list  and we shall no doubt return soon.  Highly recommended.<//Review>

Service here can be hit or miss, but that's mostly due to how busy it can get since it is on Hollywood Blvd. But it is a chill place to grab a drink after work or just for a decent outing with friends.< /review>

<Text>Great service. Fair pricing. Fun atmosphere. Really enjoyed the Prime Rib dinner, cooked perfectly to medium rare. Peanut butter Jameson shot for dessert was worth a try - dangerous because they're really tasty.

Was told the burger was nothing special.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlzaG9ByHAUfhqALdOYH8mpxGWJ5TNez2rPIx6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY5n3-OszrPLzQnxcNgcAJ-fKZ8ALh18lJzz4d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-Cfs87oZP7Dl-_upOEXMIEMYmqCe_0BjN9k9Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2bf235d490fdd:0xaaea2f1be1d3ec79</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Quite the neighborhood bar. There is no scene whatsoever, just good beer, good people and a great cheese plate. Its a great place to take friends or to hang out and meet a new one. James is the man, he will go out of his way to make sure you are having a good time and drinking more of his fine beers. The place is tiny so you better be ready to make nice with your neighbor.</review>

<Text>Stopped by for bottomless brunch with friends last August when I was in Los Angeles and thoroughly enjoyed the endless stream of mimosas and my order of steak and eggs! The hash browns weren't quite as crispy as I usually like for brunch but the eggs were cooked perfectly overeasy and the steak was a nice medium rare. Portions are huge here for the prices, and the place is pretty big so there wasn't a wait involved when we arrived, which was awesome. I'd love to come back again for brunch the next time I'm in the city!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The portion sizes were big and so were the flavors. Authentic Irish dishes and beers.  I had the fish & chips.  The fish was very tender and fried well but the fries were cold and burnt.  Still a good meal and everything else was on point.   The service was great too and we loved the music playlist of good old rock.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK96QyxaYLQJZV5GzvTNzD_lRyzekKCF4QROfA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtBkdqZr2zkej7LbjOUHwdHLlQkd-6fuVhGPUa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrKPc2ICK4M52pTfOlv1qNPkUtSJxr3WdFrOky=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3oqUieZVCeMzvNcwM-SMZwsqFJMPcJSOxVhtv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORowsPQKr9N6aWzU1p71ECVTFHrfw_0PBJQp66=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPloYHhN0rDNLiq4HUMMgWzDc_Ynjl6CJSYc73y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<review>This place was easily AS ambient as any pub in England - and I didn't believe the whole "smallest pub in North America" thing until I walked in.  Very cozy - went twice and felt like family.  Apparently the Ploughman's Platter is fantastic, good selection of cheese, onion, etc.  My aunt tried it (without me) and raved.  The owner is a hoot.  Ask him why he's allowed to call it a "pub".< /review>< pictures>

Best Mexican food in LA! Prepare to wait 2 hours for a table or stalk the bar but it's SO worth it. The service is the best and the portions are HUGE.<//Text>

A unique gem that's great if your up for something uniquely great and different.  A very friendly Englishman and fellow staff serve you ice cold beer and cider from a bathtub.  There is room for about 8-12 people.  Make friends, actually chat with people, imbibe and be jolly.< /Text>

Good service, the food was good. Whiskey selection was great. Wasn't overly impressed with how my bill came out during happy hour the first time I went there though. Still seemed pricey!
Went back a second time to watch the UFC. Plenty of TVs. Good sound and no cover charge. Brilliant!< /text>

This is a fabulous Sunday brunch location. Nestled in downtown Montrose. Gorgeous exterior view. There is a $15 bottomless mimosa on weekends. Food is really fresh delicious. There are about 20 plates you can choose from for about $13. Basic American food selection. Ray will take care of you at the bar. If your lucky there is live music once in a while on Sunday mornings. Plenty of free parking in the lot behind restaurant. 10% off when you check in on Yelp.</text>

<review>It wasn't terrible.  Had a couple beers, and a burger. They brought me the wrong burger, but I didn't realize it until I had a few bites. Wasnt bad, but I dont like blue cheese.  I didn't notice it right away.  Wasnt a huge deal.  My wife loved her BLT. With tip I think we dropped like 50$. The fries were bomb. Really liked those.  I'd eat here again.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

This place is my number one place.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I want to go to a fair dinner, this place comes instantly to my mind. excellent and   food and a large list of dishes.well mannered team, and good mood. And very important, the pay is affordable. I praise this restaurant with no doubt.< /text>

They were not very busy. Yet the only time we saw our waitress was to order and get our check (which was way past the time we were ready to leave).

<Text>We have been there for July 4th ! No complains on drinks but service was a bit poor.

We just ordered fries and beer. It took forever to bring the fries and the dips we asked for.

The music was good and decorations were apt.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWiWi3DshRYxZjRYEv_vxPlE_CYJ8aSkL3mJ1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG98ED-_SBfx-13haecaLyQDbFjPEvQL9BjULr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Good food and drinks! The grilled chicken sandwich is excellent! Prime rib too. Plastic silverware makes some of the eating a bit of a challenge, but not a major issue.<//review>

I went to the Famous recently with some friends and loved it! Definitely a chill vibe. There's a wide selection of drinks and the food is pretty good. Looking forward to go back! Definitely recommend!<//Review>

They brag about being the smallest bar on the West coast. I don't have any reason to doubt them. Standing room is barely one person wide.</Review>

The service was amazing from the guy at the door to the waitress that got our drinks. Told her we were just dropping in for a good drink she gave some options then gave us 5 min to think about. And she actually came back like 7min but she actually came back we didnt have to go haunting her down. She even gave us the check and we got to leave when we needed to go. Thank you for the amazing service.<//Text>

Whiskey and prime rib.  Can't go wrong there.  If you're a hungry guy like me, get the double cut prime rib.<//Text>

Nothing on tap the night I went in, just various beers in cans and bottles and really friendly folks inside. The bathtub full of beer completes the sensation of crowding into a bathroom with six friends to talk and drink.< /Review>

Good food, good drinks, the restaurant was clean and was very typical for a bar experience. The staff were kind and helpful. They had the entertainment of TV and they were also open to the sidewalk if you wanted to people watch. They have a patio and you cannot smoke on it.< /Text>

The food was really good and made to order.

The barback/busser kicked ass and you could tell he was working hard.

Pretty cool pub. Set-up is a little disjointed, with two bar areas otherwise joined at the hip, but different atmospheres. Music rocks, a lot of classic rock if you're into that.

Their happy hour needs revising, instead of having half price drinks they have 2 for 1 drinks....this is not the same guys. This is absolutely not good if you either have an odd number of guests, or 1 guest - reason:  it just promotes fast drinking as staff open/pour the two drinks at the same time [beer for instance], so obviously you don't want it to go flat.

Stopped in here for a quick lunch before we kept walking around Hollywood and I'm glad we did! Fish and Chips for me were fantastic! Also have great drink deals, we were there for bottomless mimosas so we had a few of those each with lunch and they weren't small cups, definitely worth it! Great spot to check out whole you're in vacation or in the area - highly recommended!< /review>

Cool bar, but it feels like they tried to put an Irish bar on Hollywood Blvd just because.  I got the bangers and mash.  No need to get that again.  But, the do offer 2 for 1 drinks at happy hour.  That's great.<//Text>

<Text>Irish themed bar/restaurant. They have 2 for 1 on drinks everyday 12- closing. I tried the Wednesday all you can eat prime rib special and it was excellent! That all being said, be prepared! The restaurant is on Hollywood Blvd, so plan for traffic and parking. The Metro train is a great option!< /Text>< username>

DO NOT EAT THERE.
Prices are good but food isn‘t. We ordered chicken wings (not eatable, smelt horroble like bad meat and was less cooked) and onion rings (had to vomit after because the consistence was spongy and fatty). But the waitress was kind, we did not have to pay the chicken wings. I seriously don‘t understand the good reviews...< /text>

<review>Creepy Orwellian cameras decent food over priced beers. You get a typical dining experience in a tourist area but they force you to submit and record your drivers license and or passport info along with a photo to enter. I didnt have time to object before I realized what was happening. Go elsewhere.</review>< pictures>

Good prices!! We went there on a Wednesday so we got seated right away, good food. We did not try the alcoholic beverages, but it seems like they had a lot of variety for beers on tap.< /review>

Yikes. Facial recognition to enter. We like this place, some of the food is pretty good and they have a selection of nice beers. But they scan your retina and take your picture when they ask for your ID before you can enter.  We found it too invasive. We're not going back.< /text>

This is by far the smallest bar I've ever been to. Its not the size of the ship it's the motion of the ocean and in terms of coolness the Black Horse popped several Viagras.</Text>

A great surprise off of Hollywood Blvd. Affordable drinks and great food. The dip sandwich was great and the bottomless drink special was great for the time we were there. Darius was super friendly and a workhorse at the bar. One thought was that the fries could use another 30s in the deep frier<//text>

Wow, I was really looking forward to ordering some Jameson's Irish Pub bbq tonight but apparently they don't take phone orders with credit cards? I asked why and they said that they've had "fraud" in the past. That must have been some kind of fraud...<//Review>

Jameson's is always a solid spot in Hollywood to get rip roaringly drunk while watching sports and scoffing down awesome pub food!
If you get there in time for their Happy Hour (which runs most of the day until later in the evening) it is two for one on all drinks.
I have had WAY too many fun evenings here with friends that resulted in me not remembering very much the next morning.
Love me some Irish pubs especially in Hollywood.<//review>

Happy Hour starts at noon every day at 12 noon. A lively fun spot on the Hollywood Strip. Sidewalk fenced seating along Hollywood blvd is great for people watching while sipping your drinks or partaking of the terrific Bar Menu.  Wednesday is "All you cab Eat Prime Rib day for all of 15 Bucks!  WOW!<//Review>

Very cool bar in a great location. I have to admit, the peanut butter jameson shots were addicting. I was shocked by the taste amd ended up having 4 of them, against my better judgment. My wife also enjoyed the bottomless mimosas, which were reasonably priced. Overall, its a place i would return to.<//review>

I loved this place. I visited on a Wednesday and they had a special for all you can eat of prime steaks for 15$ ish. I had two massive stakes. I am not sure about the prime fact but the steaks were good and the sides too! Their happy hour starts at 12pm, I think they offer buy 1 get 1 free of the same drink. However 1 beer can cost up to 8.50$ so beware! I guess for grabbing a meal in Hollywood's walk of fame it is normal prices. I recommend this place. They have big TVs and I was able to watch the world cup game!<//review>

My co workers are awesome. I have a great time, and get to meet alot of people. Another benefit is, being in Hollywood. You see all walks of life. Because it's right in front of you. (Live)</Review>

<text>This is always a go to place when I'm in town. Such great 2 for 1 drink deals and awesome staff. The food is really good and I highly recommend the salads before a night out.  Also the security guy in the front is always super nice and makes you feel at home.  Great team they got going on there.  When in LA in weho....Jamesons is a place you must go to for happy hour happiness!  You won't be disappointed!  Five stars all the way!!!</text><date>1559181602167<//date><user_name>Matthew Strong< /user_name>< resp>

Never expected to like a place on Hollywood. Shockingly good food and drink prices. Ask about them, because their specials don't apply on some holiday weekends, even when they advertise them.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Apparently these guys have different rules different times! We are touring the city and as normal humans we were carrying water bottle since there is lot of walking involved in this city. We went here in the afternoon to have lunch and nobody questioned the water bottle we had with us. We went back in the evening around 5 and the bouncer had problem with water bottle. I had just purchased it from Walgreens near by and it wasn't even open for him to doubt that it was not water ! I even opened the bottle in front of him as my wife had to take the tablet. I mentioned about morning scenario, he said rules change as soon as he takes charge !! Understand you get customers no matter how you treat them since you are located in a tourist spot but it doesn't mean you implement rules based on your mood or when bouncer comes to work ! Have a big board outside showing your rules and regulations so that customers know before getting in !!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>The service was great, the girls cute, the food runner was super polite super hard working, but the PRIME RIB WAS BEYOND TERRIBLE. I ordered the double cut prime rib entree and it was the worst thing I ever ate in a restaurant. It tasted like Steak-ums brand meat. I didn't want to be a bother or I would of sent it back, but they were busy and I hadn't eaten all day. If you're reading this only order the Prime rib if you're black out drunk. 25 bucks down the drain.</Text>< pics>

Went with female company one night, returned from toilet, and this black bouncer is standing there and asks the ladies in my group "is the guy a problem?" .  They had to tell him several times I was with the group (obviously) and was doing nothing wrong.

Maybe you ought to do criminal background checks on your employees? Big guy seemed a little too eager to start trouble.

As for my closing remarks - you are indeed lucky there is a Statute of Limitations on Assault.

BYPASS this place at all costs. You have been warned future patron!</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Pretty standard Irish bar, loved the 2 for 1 drink specials and the heated patio. Smack in the middle of Hollywood blvd and definitely one of the less touristy/pricey spots in the area.< /Text>

<Text>Great Irish themed bar located right in the centre of Hollywood Boulevard. It has a lively and relaxed atmosphere but is not too formal. There are large screen TV’s behind the bar showing a range of sports and great music. We did not get any food but it looked good from what I could see.< /Text><userid>108364886335948318802< /userid><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

<Text>Came here before and after a concert at the bowl. Loved it. Ordered a portobello mushroom sandwich with fries and it was fantastic. It also came out less than 10 minutes after I ordered it. They had 2 for 1 drink specials for happy hour. When I came back after the show, I sat at the bar and the bartender kept the drinks full.</Text>< pictures>

Nice bar but the employes are not very friendly.  Paid our first drinks with tip. Then they changed their shift. Second waitress was so unfriendly. We asked why she brings the bill after „first“ drink, then she got very unfriendly! She told us if we won‘t give a credit Card imedietaly, we have to pay now, because she is feeling uncomfortable for her tip. We told her, that we are tourists and that we don’t know this process and are feeling uncomfortable, too! She said, she is sure that we understand the process and was very angry! After no tip (for what) she was shaking her head!

Most unfriendly bar in the US in our 3 weeks vacataion!</Text>

They had a deal there 2 for the price of one, but the only thing was that they brought both beers out to you. So eventually your beers would get hot. So maybe you they should tell you I had a time. But great place to have some beers.<//text>

First time customer. Came to watch the sunday football game with 5 others. Staff was polite, place was clean but the food was horrible. 5 people in our group. Everyone was disappointed with their food, to entirely disgusted on what they call their mimosa. My personal order was their breakfast burger. Asked for medium rare. Came out charcoal burnt and the only amount of taste came from the center which had all of the salt and pepper. For the bottomless mimosas item, im not even sure what they used in it. Because champagne nor orange juice smells/taste like that. Most of the food was left on the table when we left. May come back for a drink but that's all.</Text>

<Text>Walked in on a Sunday when it wasn't packed. Seemed like they were understaffed because I only saw one server walking around. The lady walked past us a handful of times without even acknowledging us. Went to the bathroom and there was pissed all over the floor you couldn't avoid and my girlfriend said there was no paper towels or hand dryers when she went. 15 minutes later the waitress still did not even bother to apologize, ask us if we wanted drinks while we waited or bring us waters. The bus boy noticed us waiting so long and said sorry to us when trying to get her attention. Then she had the nerve to go hug and hang all over a guy sitting at the bar. We left immediately when we saw that. The place seemed like it had good drink specials and we had a good coupon for food. Wish I got her name so I could tell her manager. Never going back.<//Text>< pictures>

Nice pub kind of place on Hollywood boulevard. Came here after attending one of the jimmy kimmel live concerts a couple of blocks away. Happy hour is awesome - 2 for 1 drinks. They literally bring you 2 glasses of whatever you order at once. They also have decent amounts of TV which is always a plus for my groups of friends (bunch of guys who follow sports religiously). I had a ginger gimlet I believe and it was tasty! Would recommend if you like Jameson and ginger beer!<//review>

To compare: the most expensive entree is listed with 12$ and a Cocktail with 10$.
Really disappointing.</Review>< pics>

This place did not disappoint!! The tacos were delicious so I left stuffed because I wanted allllll the tacos!!!!!  Especially the Barbacoa and the Pollo milensa...I mean how can you really go wrong with a fried chicken on a taco?!
Additionally the ambiance was fun and the service was great! Can't wait until I'm back in town to go back!</text>

Best happy hour deal ever! Bogo drinks, we had several beers is way. My husband played beer pong with some cool dudes. The bartender was really friendly. We even came back later in the day for more beer. The placed was packed in the afternoon but it was still fast service. We also tried the portobello fries and they were really tasty.<//Text>

Very,Very expensive. I had one pint of Harp lager yes Harp that lager you have never seen since the 80s only because it was the cheapest pint on the menu and it was $9. My wife had a vodka coke and it was also $9 then you put the tip on and it's working out $22 at least a round. I get it's on Hollywood Blvd but still can't justify they prices for what your getting. Bar right next door has better options and prices.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Very nice Irish pub on Hollywood Blvd. Great location and good deals on drinks. First time tried Jameson Lager and loved it - not only taste, but price as well ($2.75 deal). Unfortunately I couldn't have a drink in the front of the store, but I guess it is because of the local law. Definitely recommend!<//text>< pics>

We came to Jamesons and had great service. Waitresses were personable and friendly. Marylee.. I think her name was... Was great & recommended great things for us to do that day. The spinach dip was the best we ever had & the chicken on my salad I give an A+. They had buy one get one on almost ALL drinks, however; they will give you a large size beer unless you specify a 16oz/ pint. Their house size beer is 2$ more expensive. We had a nice experience!!<//text>

<Review>This is my favorite bar on Hollywood BLVD. M-F 12-8pm they have a buy one, get one free on all drinks. Order one Guinness, get 2. Order 1 Margarita, get 2. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the bartenders are shady and if you order a beer, they automatically give you a giant one (or two giant ones) if you don't specify that you want the normal, human sized beer. There were even a few times where I did specify, but they pretended that they didn't hear me and overcharged me. Don't be shady... you have a great thing going and there is no need to ruin it.<//Review><Date>1536890405972< /Date><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2bf235d490fdd:0xaaea2f1be1d3ec79</gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

Only good thing about this place is the music. Staff are very rude. We had a group of about 15 and were keeping to ourselves until we got kicked out for "blocking the walkway" when we were simply waiting to get drinks behind others at the bar. Once again, very rude staff.</Text>

<text>Fun Pub on Hollywood Boulevard with great happy hour specials. Used to be a big fan of the prime rib Wednesday special, but not only have they raised the price from 10 to $15, but service has gotten a lot slower so it's tough to really enjoy an all-you-can-eat experience there.<//text><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>The waitress acted like she had misunderstood the tip I wanted to pay. I thought the tip was normal, but she added a few dollars on top. When I pointed this out, she said she had misunderstood me due to my accent (even though previously she didn`t have any problems understanding me) and didn`t on her own initiative go back to the register to redo the check.

This of course makes the ambiance, quality of food and the rest of the service irrelevant to this review.< /Text><rating>1</rating>< userid>

Food was simply bad, even the soda was bad! Place is cool, but not worth the visit. Also, when we were paying I noticed a 4.9% self imposed tax to offset the cost of living in LA, just because they wanted to impose the tax! and even worst, they charged us $3.75 for a beer that was clearly stated for $2.75. Do not visit this place!!</text>

<review>This was my 1st time and this establishment and was not impressed at all. Within my 1st 5 mins in the location I headed to the bathroom coming out found a guest/ customer passed out on the floor... this is not my complain. After stepping out of the bar after being there for 45 mins the gentleman who clearly had too much to drink was unresponsive sitting outside on the street. They “staff workers” disposed of him and made no attempt to call 911 for alchohol poisoning. When checking on him after being curious because it look like he was no longer alive. His breathing was very faint and I had to call 911. Dispatch requested to lay him on his back and to keep an eye on him until they arrived.

My point being that this establishment does not care of the life’s of its customers. I understand that while you trying to keep the place sane and getting the over drinkers out is priority for guest service you need to acknowledge and be aware of all your customer can’t toss them into the street and let strangers take pictures of you and make fun of them.

I definitely will not come back and honestly this review probably won’t matter to you after seeing how you treat your customers but I definitely hope when people read this review  that at least they have been warned. Don’t count on this bar for help, it’s all about revenue here.

Oh and I forgot, business have a capacity for alloted people inside get your bouncers to realize how to count. So many people spilling beer because there is not enough room to move! At least move the tables and make space.< /review></record>

Awful. Prime rib was literally rotten. Smelling and looking. Ordered a double cut and it was too thin ones on top of each other. Was disgusted after one bit. It smelled like raw meat..rotten.... beware.<//Review>

I tapped him on the shoulder said excuse me and he said in all seriousness,  "Don't touch me and I will tell you in a second! "

So he had heard me the first time and chose to ignore me, then got rude at a shoulder tap. Highly unprofessional but I guess that is kind of service you can expect there.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Waitress waited 30 mins before checking on our order. Which was not even cooking because he never got the ticket. They cut the bangers and mash in half to cook it faster. And the "irish nachos" are French fries with cheese and bacon. Not potatoes skins the way it should be. Then she was kind enough to "not charge us for ranch".. Gee thanks. Since you messed up my order are me wait( btw if was completely empty when we got here ). Seeing as I have actually been to Ireland think i can say this place is a gimmick, and will only taste good if your too drunk to taste.<//text>

<review>Today your manager tried to Harass while I was having a drink: a male customer was bothering me, but this is a big mistake.  The Bartender who didn't know what was happening came to  put me out.

I never warranted the treatment given in front of everyone.

Disable Senior Citizen having a drink but very familiar with your employee's and you.  Bad Management at the moment... Current Manager after 2 years of Football Season He is not working out.  Get Rid of Him.  I will sue for Customer abuse/Discrimation to a Black Customer.  Fix This Now.

Neighbor Customer Mistreated by Manager.

It's on Hollywood Boulevard so naturally it will be touristy with high prices and all, but an Irish pub is an Irish pub, i.e. the atmosphere is relaxed, the ale and whiskey is good and it's just overall nice.</text>

Great happyhour (noon-to-8pm M-F BOGOF); food priced under $10; turkey meatloaf made fresh daily (same used for turkey meatball sandwiches); handmade fries, etc. It's an Irish Pub in the heart of Hollywood.</text>

Chaotic, small and dark.
Not superlative burgers, the prices are excessive as everywhere. Suitable if you are out and about and can't wait to get something to eat.
After 18 minors not allowed.
