<text>I called for an appointment and Mike answered saying I could come in ASAP for a haircut, I arrived 5 min later. I said I had an appt and they had me sit and wait for 30 min and proceeded to let 2 walk-ins go ahead of me. (They were known by the gentlemen but stated they had no appointment) I was in a hurry and the other barbers were just starting their haircuts so I decided to leave.This barber shop does not seem to need any new customers so don’t waste your time unless you are well known by the barber shop they will treat you like you are an outsider.</text>< Pics>

<Review>We just move here in Menifee  so I must say I was a little concern because I am female African American n when I called the person on the phone told me that they do all hair type. Well the place was clean n the music was on time. Kathleen I believe that the correct spelling of her name she did such a beautiful job on my afro My husband love it.  And so did I thank you I'll be back

<rate>5<//rate><review>A great barbershop, staff is friendly and very talented. I highly recommend Alphonzo, I have always been a fan of the flat top and even though it sounds like an easy cut, very few ever get it right. They also offer shaves, and have several tvs and a good atmosphere.</review>< Pictures>

Last weekend I was forced to go to Super Cuts.. due to covid hours..😏 in which they did a poor job. Today I was lucky enough to get Cassandra.  She did an amazing job; super tight, clean-medium, razor fade. This place is perfect for  those that are looking for the cleanest fades in town.

<Text>Made an appointment and came in and as soon as i sat down they called me up, Aly did my fade and my beard line up and it was amazing how much focus she had put into it to make sure it came out well. She definitely delivered quality on it and would recommend her. As well it was a nice place to hang out in, everyone was pretty chill and the establishment was clean. looking forward to going back and getting lined up again.</Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Great vibe and received compliments on my haircut all week. Cuts aren't high so I left larger tip than usual. The place was packed but the music kept me from stressing over it. Knew the words to all the songs. Lol sang a little while getting my haircut. Pleasantly surprised. All barber shops were closed at noon on Saturday. Going back today.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc9e0e8fb93b07:0x30f75b99867c62ea</Gmap_id></record>

Never get bad results from those two but everyone can cut there. Make an appointment a day ahead and beat the line cause it can be packed at times.<//review>< rate>

I like it here, barbers are cool they just get a lot of personal calls and stuff which kinda extends my stay a little too long sometimes.</Review>

This was the worst haircut I have ever received! The guy would stop and text in the middle of my haircut, he completely rushed my fade, he was talking smack about me to his buddy across the room in spanish, and my haircut was completely butchered.  I do not recommend wasting your money here.</Review>

<Review>I've been going to Fades and Blades for over 4 years now. (That should say enough) The owner Beto is my barber and he knows how to cut, and he always does me right!!! I also have 2 boys ages 16 & 12 and they both go to Yesi. (The lady barber)  My boys love her!!!  I really appreciate that she takes her time and she has NEVER given my boys a bad haircut.
I'm very picky and all the barbers there can get down and their prices are totally affordable.<//Review>< pictures>

My fiancé was in desperate need of a quality hair cut,  I was recommended by my brother to bring him to Joe at Fadez & Bladez, I must say,  I will definitely have my fiance come here to get that nice precise hairline I like!  Thankx Joe, I'm glad I was able to find my honey a new barber!</Review>

<gmapID>0x80dc9e0e8fb93b07:0x30f75b99867c62ea< /gmapID><Text>If you're looking for a great cut, barbers who take their time, reasonable prices, fresh cuts and a traditional Barber Shop where conversations range from sports, music, style, pop culture relationships (keep it minimal) and etc., this is the spot. Trust me when I say that I've known barbers, been to countless of barber shops, and could finally say I've found the spot to cut my hair. I've been going with BETO (owner) for 5 years and it's worth the 40min drive, especially for a cut for any occasion. He's popular with the in-style cuts, fades, tapers and Shave Blades (hot shaves), there's a reason ppl wait for him. If you, however, ever find yourself waiting for Beto don't be mistaken everyone there is good (don't be skeptic on the women barbers, they know how to cut too, trust me!). If BETO is off or busy, YESI and OMAR are my go-to ppl. Amenities such as TV's, vending machines, couches and clean public bathrooms are provided with a hip hop flare on the walls. The spot provides appointments upon request (certain days), kid friendly and located in Sun City where geriatric population is dominant, even elderly people are welcomed and feel no intimidation surrounded by millenials. You won't go wrong choosing this barber shop, just make sure you don't find yourself eating all the food in the vending machines and not have enough money for a cut, trust me, it has happened!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

<Review>There is no ordinance there. Everyone is just cutting or coming way too close to you instead of six feet apart. Almost everything and everyone there are no following the safety rules at all. It's very sketchy but it was easy once it was my turn it was just giving papers in the front and that was all. But they need to work on cleaning the outside and following the safety rules or enforce it.< /Review><Date>1619636956468</Date><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7ddd4f83319:0xc951a7848a2c797b<//GmapID><name>Cas E< /name><rating>2<//rating>< user>

I've been waiting for 2 hours and 30 minutes, the lady i was on the phone with, which she didn't give me her name and was extremely rude by the way.. got all my information that took 5 minutes.. then left me on hold for  these almost 3 hours, now i'm trying to call through another phone.. and they still haven't answered i called about 40 minutes ago.. this is absolutely ridiculous. Don't get me started on the time sheet website. i hate that i have to even give a star to post this.< /review>

I called was on hold for two hours and when then answered. The lady was very rude. I kept my cool and ask her a few more questions and she kept being rude even though I was polite. When I asked her for her name she say very loud WHY and i said you are very rude, then I asked to speak to a supervisor and she hung up. There was no help she was rude didnt want to give me her name. This happened September 17th 2019 @12:30. Very frustrating.<//review>

I asked for a fax number. I ws told they don't have one... every way of trying to get answer , I was blocked. basically I was sent away with no answers.... were can I file a complaint? this is not fair. been trying to reach someone for over a month..</Review>

They dnt even deserve one star! This people are horrible , they telling you one thing and doing another. I sent them a new provider form a month ago and I called to confirm it and they said they never receive anything and the lady on the phone was so rude she didn’t even offer me an options by phone she just said I can’t help you! Just to reach them by phone taking 2 hours waiting !</Text>

Which turns out to be the wrong number so they keep passing you around and leaving you on hold for an hour at a time. When they send out a worker to evaluate the receiver's medical needs and condition, they give you an appointment time that they don't follow so you waste half your day waiting for someone to show up. They're so quick to inconvenience you by deducting your pay to go to union dues or irrelevant costs, however if you want to cancel any said costs it takes them MONTHS to do so or get back to you. Horrible customer service.<//Review><user>109083322394165190367<//user><Time>1548270809745< /Time></record>

<Text>In person everything went quick and everything was handled accordingly. I understand they serve thousands of people, but I dislike that no one cares to answer the phone and/or there rarely any attempts to return a phone call at times. I hope this changes as they grow professionally because they are doing good at a job that it very underappreciated. Thank you!</Text>< Pictures>

It doesn't matter what time I call, right @ 8:00 am, 8:15 am, 9 am or later in the morning no one answers the phone. Its ridiculous that this department is so understaffed that no one answers the phone. Wow. We got to do better.< /text>

She calls the worker and no answer, when she leaves messages she doesn't call back even thoe the recording says they'll get back to you "the next business day" it doesn't happen. She's left messages to supervisors and still nothing, all she's waiting for now is time sheets to get paid, she's still waiting. This is just so terrible, I wanna see all these people that work in the IHSS office go months without getting paid even after going to work everyday.

No returned calls to Next of Kin regarding EVERY SINGLE CARETAKER taking advantage of Deceased man's credit cards and debit cards...there is no phone number for a supervisor named Ms. Gonzalez per Robert Sahakian's voicemail. Would give no stars but i'm forced to give one.</Review>

In the beginning I had thought the application was going smoothly.  I understood that this can be a painful process so I made sure I did everything right and on time to prevent any delays.  I have left my job to take care of the recipient months ago and I needed income.

The recipient (my mother) and I (provider) applied for both Protective Supervision and other types of services.  "Other types services"  were approved first.  I was told that the determination of Protective Supervision will take longer.  However, it's been over 3 months now since we have applied and I still haven't received a single pay check.  The timesheets were delayed because the case worker did not  finalize the approval before leaving on a 3 week vacation.

I understood that Protective Supervision will take longer for the determination of case.  Then the case worker tells me that there will be a delay because her supervisor is on a 1 week vacation.  Then a few days later the case worker calls me back and said that there will be further delays because she is taking a 3 week vacation!  This in total is about a 1 month delay in itself.

Finally after over 3 months, I have received a notice in mail that my recipient has been approved for Protective Supervision.  Then the caseworker tells me that I'm not qualified for any retropay because the recipient's Protective Supervision service case was a borderline.  This does not make any sense to me.  I had to provide recipients additional Dangerous Behavior logs to help in approving the case and the case was approved.  My understanding is that I am automatically eligible for any retropay.  I should be paid from my start date.

Because of delays and issues I have called IHSS a number of times and I still haven't received a single paycheck.  On top of that, there are some staff members there at the IHSS office who are incompetent and caused me further delays and issues by giving me wrong answers.

I am currently corresponding with the case worker's supervisor regarding my retropayments.  Hope this will solve the issue and no more headaches from IHSS.<//Text>

<review>My time card was supposedly not received for the pay period of April 1-April 15 , I mailed it out on April 16. I called for a duplicate time card , I was really surprised that I even was able to get through on the phone usually they don't answer and it takes days to get in touch with someone, as this has happened before. My problem now is that has been well over a week now that I talked to a lady named Shirley who assured me a duplicate time card would be sent. As of now I still didn't receive that , so they don't seem to care that I am not getting paid , already May 7, and no pay for the whole month of April , I'm getting very frustrated even physically sick over it. I have a rash that might be shingles from stress and poverty of not being paid!!<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>Most poorly run operation in America. There is never anyone available to answer the phone or call you back.  I spent MONTHS trying to resolve an issue that was THEIR FAULT. The amount of time and stress it takes to get the services my family is supposed to get is so awful. I would not give it any stars but I am forced to.<//review>< Pictures>

This place is a total disaster! Their system for contacting is the worst on the planet. Never have I experienced anything as bad as them. They should read their reviews and actually take heed and make some serious changes! *It was hard to keep this review as clean and non explicit as possible.<//Review>

She provided her own insight and she even let me test her personal bike so we can compare sizes before I made a purchase.

Ernesto and the crew made a pretty smooth process of buying my new bike....friendly, knowledgeable and shared my excitement. No pressure sales and let me test ride around the block first. Nice open and clean shop, well organized and controlled during social distancing.I went there for a particular bike and left with exactly what I wanted, including some pedals I wanted which they had in stock. A consistently good experience I get from the Helen’s Cycles family.<//Text>

The shop did a great job on tuning my bike, and did not try and upsale me on services that I didn’t need.  In addition, they have a good warranty on the service.  The shop is clean, and  the people are professional.   They made my appointment and the work was performed in a timely manner.< /review>

I drive 25 miles rather than seek similar service from a more local shop because they are so good. I greatly appreciate their enthusiasm for my business and it only enhances my enjoyment of cycling.

Excellent service, Friendly staff, My salesman, and service rap Ernesto Castro  makes time for me when I have service related questions about my Trek DS4.  The last time I was at I Martin's for my Trek DS4 tune-up I spend some time with Scott Macpherson store manager and world class cyclists who gave me really good tips and techniques on how to become a stronger cyclists. I Martin's is your one stop shop for sales, service, and parts.  I highly recommend I Martin's and my experiences has always been positive.<//Text>

Everyone at iMartin was amazing and super helpful. I came in on my way to a bike ride after borrowing a friend's bike that had some issues with it. They helped me get it rideable without even charging me anything. I told them I was coming back to buy a bike from them, and I did. I went back, browsed and tried bikes, then put a deposit on my favorite bike to pick up later that week. Then I went snowboarding and injured myself, so the bike stayed there for an additional three to four weeks. When I finally went back, my bike was there with the tag on with my name, and everyone was super kind and helpful. I've been wanting to buy my own bike for ten years and I'm glad that when I finally did, it was here. :)</text>

Sports Basement is not easy for me to rate. I think they have reasonable prices for upscale outdoor goods and a great selection. They specialize in outdoor sports gear and clothes, but not other sports. This is definitely not Sports Authority or Big 5. It's the real deal though. I really like their outdoor clothes selection that suits San Francisco's climate. I like their shoe selection. It's such a big store, but something's missing. I don't ever pay attention to what is on the far left of the store.< /text>

<Review>Absolutely love Sports Basement. I've spent a lot of time there recently picking up new gear and chatting with their staff and they all really are experts in their fields. The bike crew is particularly excellent, in fact I've picked up two bikes there the past few years and constantly find myself coming back for the fitting master Pedro. Guy's a pro! It's one thing to buy a sweet bike, and another to actually help it fit right. Pedro and the Sports Basement crew do both.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2b94ac0d69f05:0x97a5b17247ab77a4<//gmapID>< UserId.>

My friends and I are sports basement season ski bus pass holders (SF to Squaw Valley) and absolutely love using it to sleep-bus our way to Tahoe. Great value and a really fun camaraderie with the other bus riders and staff. It's really awesome being able to day trip up for skiing without having to deal with driving in snow, chains and all the stress of staying up driving for several hours. Instead we can sleep our way there and drink on the way back :D</review>

<Text>They always do a great job for repair and have a good selection but I've encountered that since the pandemic they can't do things nearly as quickly as before. I've had my bike repaired here several times and usually got it back by end of day but the other day I took my bike over to fix a spoke they said the earliest they could turn it around was over a week +.  I use my bike as my primary form of transit so that didnt work for me. Took it somewhere else that took care of it on the spot. I do understand that they have become much more busy since the pandemic but turnaround times that far out even for simple fixes is super disappointing. While I may still shop here for accessories I most likely will not take back for repair again as there are 5 other shops along my route to and from home.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Angie helped me find a great deal on Ray Bans sunglasses last weekend. She went ABOVE AND BEYOND and it was an experience that I appreciate greatly. She gave me honest advice and made sure I was taken care of. I became a Basementeer because of Angie and will now depend on the Sports Basement as my resource for all outdoor needs.< /Review>

I went in to get cycle shoes after having lots of returns on Amazon.  The service was great.  They found the right shoe at the right size and put the clips on for me.  All and all a great experience.<//text>

We never buy our bikes anywhere else. These folks go out of their way to help with service and choosing the RIGHT bike for the RIGHT purpose! My kids frequently ride down to them to have them check out a funky sound or see if their brakes are okay and the team always treats them as respected fellow cyclists. I purchased a bike rack from them a few years ago and needed to put it back on in time for vacation -- made a stop by iMartin and asked them to take a look at it to make sure I'd done it correctly. They made some adjustments at no charge and were happy to help even though they were super busy. Love this place and adore this team!<//Review>

Good service but they were overwhelmed with customers. If you have people wait outside in line please install a tent or shade. It would help with people getting hot and irritated while waiting.

Also good prices comparatively and making 5 stars for the comment by owner.</Text>

<name>Andrew Siu<//name><Review>Came to fix stem and wheel but instead was kicked out and told they are not able to fix bike. Previous time, repair was ok but after that they almost made me to recycle my bike and buy their overpriced one cuz supposedly mine is broken. Last time one bald Mr just literally yelled and kicked me out of the store. terrible attitude towards clients. If you are not a walking bag of money, you have nothing to do here. I'm not recommending to come to this bike store. Awful customer service, overpriced, disrespectful workers.< /Review>< rating>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Going in for the first time, I felt comfortable, and well taken care of! Let's start with their COVID precautions. This location truly cares about their customer's health! Everyone wears masks, stands 6 feet away from their customers when talking to them, and closely monitors the store capacity (I even saw them gently ask someone to wait outside as he was just sitting in the store waiting for a friend/family to shop)!

The customer service is also top notch! I told Gant what I was looking for that day and he immediately took my budget into consideration while showing me their inventory. Not once did he try to up-sell me on anything. He gave me his opinion on every single item that I asked about, and even provided me a bunch of safety tips for being on the road since he knew I was just starting out!

There was a moment I was looking at an expensive item and Gant told me what was good about it, but also why it may not be necessary for me at this time. He then helped me find something better suited for my current needs (and it cost less, too!) He never made me feel pressured to buy any unnecessary gear. Gant didn't care that I didn't know anything about biking, he just wanted to make sure that when I got out onto the road, that I stayed safe no matter what!

I'm glad this is the closest bike shop to me, as I'm for sure coming back whenever I need anything bike related!< /Review>< user_id>

Friendly and informative, on the phone and in person! Every other shop our family has contacted has been rude or disorganized or both. Businesses can't control a lot of the things that happen to them with this lock-down environment, but they can control their reaction. Good people at I Martin...Thanks</text>

Good quality work done but waiting 35 minutes to drop off a bike which has an appointment made 2 weeks ago is definitely a bummer

Granted it was a busy Sunday wish there was some kind of triage queue for sales / repairs</text>

Leo has taken great care of all my bikes, which I have generally bought second hand.

I went to I. Martin with my 5 year old twin boys and their grandparents looking to buy each of them a 20in bike. We met Amanda when we arrived. She was very nice, kind, and easy to talk to. She helped us with our new bikes, bells, and front "baskets". Super sweet salesperson!

I won't give 1 star because in general the bike shop here is good, but I called to try and get a quote on a repair and the woman at the front desk was a total drama queen. Look. This place tries to bill itself as a bike shop that happens to do bike repair when they should really flip it. They are a busy bike repair shop with a ton of over priced bikes and odd retail workers who know nothing about bikes.  FYI because of the lack of knowledge from the woman I spoke with today and her inability to communicate normally to me or the repair people has resulted in me taking my business elsewhere.< /text>

< Review>
Always been a great store, if you are traveling and need a tire replaced they usually have used tires and tubes in their dumpster, thank you...its come in handy more than a few times. It sounds funny but there is actually a group of people who live in tenta 1 block west of there and they are very helpful with tools, food and its a nice neighboorhood...IMartin im sure dosnt condone of it but they have a dock in back that is perfect and safe for sleeping. If your traveling i mean. What ..its okay.  Its just for the night...< /Review>

This is the #1 rated bike store in the United States. It has the best techs & mechanics and the equipment is top notch.  I have been a customer since 1978 and have built and purchased many road bike there.  There is no better place to get a bike, regardless of the level of riding.  They are the best.</Review>

Amazing. Staff were super helpful! Got exactly what I came for, and great prices! There is one thing, though it has nothing to do with the store, is if you need a kickstand, make sure the bike you are getting has one. Again that has nothing to do with the store, and a really great one at that!< /review>

I Martin is a fabulous cycling shop that really knows how to take care of your bike.  They offer great recommendations for repairs and upgrades and their pricing is fair.  Best of all, the shop team knows that you don't want to wait a week to get your baby back on the road.  Highly recommend this experienced team!<//Text>

Surprised to read the negative reviews.  I've bought three bikes from BR and had several flat tires, tire replacement and chain repairs and have always been satisfied.  If it's busy (I'm usually there on the weekend) yo definitely have to make your presence known and I agree that serious bikers who are also regulars at the store are recognized and greeted warmly but I find that normal rather than off-putting.<//text>

Every product I have purchased at I Martin Bicycles has been done after carefully considering all options.  The products at this store are what I would consider "elite".  Customer service is parallel to the quality of the products sold.   I first went to this store in 2015, and the product I purchased still functions like new, I remember I had many questions and doubts about buying, and left super satisfied with my purchase.  Investing in a bike or the accessories can be expensive, this is a place where I leave feeling confident.  I also like the service area in the back of the store, I had two of my bikes assembled there, the service was fast, and in addition they have installed the majority of my bike accessories.<//text>

Excellent service from Jason. Very helpful guy, they don’t charge more on your tunning if your bike don’t need something else. Jason has amazing attitude and he suggests the best for that you need about his experience.

Love that store!<//text>

I Martin is about as professional as a bike shop can get. My experience here has always been good. Employees and mechanics always excited to see customers and encourage you to go look around. Mechanics always have good friendly advice and are generally pretty cool to talk too. Same with the employees. Totally recommend this place if you’re in the area. They are honest and I can assure you that they won’t ever skimp a customer.</text>

Excellent excellent. I bought my bike here. I got great advice and bought a great bike that I love. Excellent service. I recently dropped it and it started ghost shifting. I don’t live close anymore so had it adjusted elsewhere. It continued to ghost shift. I finally brought it here and was told the derailer was bent too. I bought another one and it rises like a charm. Perhaps the other shops were trying to save me money but I think they just didn’t check the derailer carefully.  They were quick too.  I will always bring it to iMartin in the future. Wish I had come here right away. They also have great products.</review>

Even though there are countless bike shops in the UWS, I always bring my bike here for maintenance.  I've had my road bike for over 5 years now and I got it tuned a few weeks ago, just got back from a 40 mile ride and the bike feels better than brand new.  Also the staff here is great, helpful but never pushy.< /Text>

Everyone I talked to was very helpful. I just needed a couple of inner tubes and tire lever, and they helped me make the right choice of tube size. They were also good at explaining how to use the levers. I would definitely come back for anything else I needed.<//text>

Incredibly friendly and knowledgable local shop.  Hard to justify buying online when the service is this good in the shop.  We've purchased 3 bikes, 5 helmets, two pairs of shoes, lights, and just about everything else here.  We even returned our daughter's bike a week of Christmas because "Santa" didn't bring the right size.<//Review>

< review>
The folks at Wiggle were super friendly and helpful. I walked in with zero bike knowledge, and they answered all of my questions, offered advice, and refrained from sales talk. I walked out feeling empowered with a bike I love. The best part is that I get to ride by Wiggle on my way to work each day.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Excellent experience!!! I was recommended to this shop and I'm so glad that I was!!! Fred had me try several bikes to get the right frame style then worked with me to find something in my budget. Fred was not working when I picked up my bike but Jaime spent the time with me to fit the bike properly. I have a very short torso and long femurs which Jaime noticed right away and adjusted everything so that my knees are safe but I'm still not reaching for the handlebars. I left the shop with everything I needed and while it wasn't especially cheap I have full confidence in these guys and plan to go back for everything else I need!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Super friendly and knowledgeable staff! It was my first time boxing my bike for travel and, in addition to providing the box, they let me take my bike apart in the shop so I could borrow tools and ask questions throughout the process. If I lived in LA, this would be my go-to bike shop! Highly recommended.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b94ac0d69f05:0x97a5b17247ab77a4< /Gmap_id>< name>

While holidaying in LA I found my custom road bike needed a few different (crucial) parts than I had counted on.  Ryan (I presume head mechanic) is your man - he is a most professional, knowledgeable, helpful and skilled tech in a great shop which has just about anything (however arcane) you might need for your beloved two wheeler.  I can't say enough about his attention to detail!< /text>

Great selection, knowledgeable staff. Bike purchases come with perks like a free tune up and first flat tire replacement. The bikes that have a good brands and well priced. Also sell an assortment of bike accessories (locks, bells, helmets, seats, etc).<//text>

Everybody in the store was helpful, they immediately looked at my bike for me, fixed a few small things for me and then I was on my way. They did all this for me at no charge, which blew my mind, it was incredibly cool of them.

All of the repair prices were right there in front of you, so you know exactly what you're going to pay for. As I get more in riding, this will always by my bike shop of choice.

Thanks again!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b94ac0d69f05:0x97a5b17247ab77a4< /gmap_id></record>

I went here to check it out and some of the workers took like 10 minutes to just talk to me about the LA cycling scene and gave me some great tips on rides and routes. And I didn't even buy anything! This is the bike shop in LA that will be getting ALL of my business in the future.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I'm just a student who relies on his bike to get around this car crazy city - so when I took my front tire in to be looked at I was worried they would try to overcharge me. After explaining the reoccurring problem I was having with my tube slipping and being punctured at the valve, they replaced my tire with a used one they had sitting around for free because they were out of mountain bike tires. It's working now and no longer puncturing the tube! Thank you so much :)</Review>

<Review>Awful store, some exotic bikes with prices and bad attitudes just like a Ferrari dealer.

Refused service on a bike that was bought there (at a premium) because it wasn't bone stock anymore. My father in law spent over 6 grand on bikes and accessories at this store, but they told him to "come pick it up, and get it out of here" because these guys are remedial mechanics with no imagination or skill.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>First off, the mechanics did a fantastic job on relacing a troublesome wheel. The work is solid and they made judgement calls that were appropriate and made sense. However, when I dropped the wheel off I asked about price saying in the past it had been X dollars, to which the service clerk said 'yeah it'd be about that'. When I returned to pick up my wheel it was almost 3x what was discussed with no phone call to make sure this price increase was acceptable. After that I also decided to get some new break and shifter cables with housing. The same clerk up-sold me on a pre-packaged kit saying it includes both break and shifting cable/housing. It does not.

I feel like every interaction was manipulative and I will certainly be looking for another bike shop and advising others to do the same.<//text>< Time>

Jaime gave me a couple options that were definitely in my budget. I ended up purchasing the Shimano PD-M324 pedals because I am a commuter. Since they are dual sided I can clip in with my cycling shoes or use the flat side when wearing street shoes. For shoes I went with the Shimano 2013 SH-M088.

1st time visit: This place is awesome.  Fast, friendly and excellent customer service.  Matt was great from our initial phone conversation.  I needed help with a new seatpost and saddle and he gave me some excellent choices.  Once I got into the store he remembered me and assisted me within minutes.  I left a happy guy without breaking my bank. Service over sales was my experience and I'll definitely return.< /Text>< rate>

<Time>1376810528883</Time><rating>5</rating><text>Love this place - the entire staff are very friendly and clearly very passionate riders, which makes them fantastic to learn a thing or two from while chopping it up with them in the shop. Matt has been helping me out since I was a relatively new rider, and the guys in the shop have saved me money in times I thought I was going to have to spend way more. I recently picked up a 2013 Cannondale CAAD 8 6 Tiagra that fits perfectly and turned out to be less than the price on the Cannondale site. I couldn't be more stoked. Highly recommend this place!<//text>< Pics>

So this review is after give this shop a month to redeem themselves after a bad encounter we had . i called ahead of time asking to get a bottom bracket replaced because the one at got from he'ens in santa monica didnt get installed properly . i was told it would take an hour and that could wait for it , i swung by and as they proceed the gentlemen that i spoke was well on his way start , a tall "mechanic" with glasses started to make a huge deal about servicing my bike on the spot . the shop was empty they had three mechanics and even though i was offering to pay more for the  service cause i needed to get to work  they made up a bogus reason that it was busy and that they didnt have the "tool" for a bb68 (found on English bottom brackets 68)  nor  a bb30 tool . so i was bummed out ad left .

later that week i go in with my wife to get her a bike and for about 30mins of walking around tht "huge"  store we don't apporched by a single person to help us out . so we asked to see a few bikes , being a avid commuter , racer , etc.  i didn't appreciate how he spent 20 mins try to upsell a hybrid when we kept asking for a road bike .....shows how in tune they are with their costumer base....

overall those  were just a few issues that stuck out, the shop doesnt really feel welcoming nor a place that has a passion for the lifestyle of riding .....they just see $$$  stamped on peoples forehead<//Review>

I just had a rear derailleur hanger bracket installed and they charged me $25 for literally 10 minutes of work. Really! I know the shop is located very close to Beverly Hills but that's pretty ridiculous. Not all your customers have deep pockets.< /Review>

April 2nd around 5:15    I just got given a nice old bike with a broken chain, and so I ggogled the shop closest to me and I. Martin came  up.  I called and they said they were open till 7pm and they do service.  I took it in, and the service mechanic took my bike  in right away, adjusted the seat and fixed the chain.  The guy realized I was a newbie and only charged me $5 and had my bike ready in 15 minutes.  While shopping one of the sales girls came up to me to see if I needed help.  The lady that checked me out was curteous and friendly.< /Text>

<text>Shocked there's only one review of this incredible establishment, i.e. A.A Recovery and the like.  To me the greatest recovery club on the planet, someone from every walk of life.  A great admin, terrific people working the front desk - meetings around the clock (or until midnight).  Hafta go back for something now - so grateful you're there for me/us, WC.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2c0fcd1877a9f:0xd45bb8b43185f3b7</gmap_id></record>

<review>I have had only positive experiences here in San Marcos! I have not had to wait more than 20 minutes during busy times and consistently am in to see the doctor in much less time than that. I purposely avoid busiest times, so this may vary at peak hours—in my experience though it is efficient and thorough at the same time. The team here in San Marcos has consistently been willing to answer my questions and give feedback to help me manage my care outside of chiropractic sessions. I also really appreciate that any and all staff members that I’ve interacted with have been friendly and helpful, even with minor questions. I would definitely recommend the joint if you are new to seeing a chiropractor or if you’re looking for one!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc7543e1d8567b:0xfaca78227aa01557< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Hines is absolutely a pleasure, he is always so kind, respectful, professional and attentive. I love his work and its always a pleasure to get an adjustment by him.
Ms. Deborah at the front desk is marvelous. Her customer service is superb, always informative and very helpful. I always appreciate her kindness upon my visits.
These two are fantastic and has made my visits pleasurable, I've received a ton of relief and their service has kept me as a continued customer!</Text>

After a week of back pain I finally decided to get something done about it. The Joint was very close and although it had been a while since I have seen a Chiropractor, they quickly explained how their program works. Price is hard to beat for treatment over a few weeks and Dr. Hines was very friendly while giving me my ‘adjustments’, explaining as he goes. Felt so much better after the initial visit and am very pleased with the results 3 weeks in. Highly recommended.< /text>

I needed one day to write this post as I was too upset to post one day this incident occurred. I have been a Joint customer for several years. This post is about Dr. Hines. He’s always been pleasant and professional until yesterday, Friday, 4/24.
I came late in the day, around 6 pm. As I approached the back room, we greeted one another, and he asked if I had any areas that he should treat. I told him then I asked him, “do I lay facing up or down.” He said down & began to question me. “Do you need a GPS to get here?” I didn’t understand the question and I said “what?” then  he repeated the question again. I then answered no. He began to school me. He then said that since I’ve been there many times, I should know by now on what to do. I replied, “well, You & the other Dr.(who works the weekends) work differently as she requests that I face up. He then walks over to the computer and checks my record & tells me, “the last time you saw her was a month ago.” I couldn’t believe what was happening. At this point, I was so confused I didn’t even know what to do and I couldn’t follow him. At this particular moment, I turned and looked at him and asked, “are you having a bad day?” He responds, “No,I’m not; I’ve had a long day!” and repeats it several times.

You can imagine what the energy was like between us back there. In hindsight, I should have walked away from him, but my lower back was aching and I needed this adjustment.

Is he good at his profession? Yes. He knows his stuff; but he needs to work on his bedside manners and not take his frustration and unhappiness on his customers.Thankfully, the front desk representative was there to hear and witness the confrontation.

Will I return to him? NO.  He made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I may have to cancel service because my go-to Dr (weekend) is no longer there.

Who knew one question could trigger someone to spiral down the black hole? 🤷🏽‍♀️</review>

I don’t use The Joint on a regular basis, only when I’m having back and neck issues. Then I will usually go three or four times and all is good. This location is close to home and I like the chiropractor there. It’s easy it does the job and it’s quick.</Review>

<text>WORTH THE DRIVE! I signed up at the oceanside location since they are close to my home, but after seeing 3 different chiropractors, I wasn't happy with any of them. My sister recommended I try the San Marcos location, and boy am I glad I did! Dr. Hines is amazing!! He was able to pinpoint all my problem areas without my having to tell him and provided an amazing adjustment. This is my new go to spot. Worth every penny, and worth having to drive further for a stellar adjustment. I felt like brand new woman after my appointment. I would HIGHLY recommend him. Thanks Dr Hines!

<Text>Dr. Hines is the absolute best; he's very communicative and open about the treatment you're receiving. The genuine care and professionalism I get from my visits with him is always stellar. Also, he's probably the nicest person I've ever met!

I've only had one experience with the other doctor at this location, Dr. Nazer, but I found her to be professional and effective!

There have been a variety of front desk staff present while I've been visiting, and they've all been very nice and helpful. I can't recommend this place enough.

In terms of my care, I've been feeling better physically than I have in years, I have a greater range of motion, and I experience less and less pain as I go on!<//Text>< Pictures>

Wow wow wow! All I can say is Wow!
This office and especially Dr. Hines is beyond the best chiropractor I’ve ever been to in the last 7 years I’ve been looking around. He’s been adjusting me for the past 18 months and i will say, my migraines are completely gone, my body feels better, and I can always count on an amazing appointment. His level of professionalism, positive attitude, and attention to detail on certain spots is what makes me as a client go out of my way to see him. I use to live 45 minutes away, and I would drive all the way to this office when another location was 5 minutes from me. The front desk always greeted you and cares about you as friends/family then just a doctors office. I would never go anywhere else but Dr Hines and Debbie!

Thank you for always putting a smile on my face and giving me such a wonderful experience 2 times a week for 18 months and even more!</review>

<Text>Dr. Hines in the San Marcos Ca. branch is the best. He is will to listen and educate you about your body and provides stretching videos from Joint. I started going back after spending years not being adjusted. At work I
spend all day over a computer so headaches and low back pain started to become common. It's been about 2 months since my first visit and I'm feeling 100% better. FYI, spin maintenence is a must for better circulation and skeletal movement. I have recommended the San Marcos branch to my friends at work and would recommended him to all my family and friends. Great job!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>My back went out one morning before work, and I wasn’t sure what to do. I found The Joint online, and saw all the great reviews on Dr. Hines. He is so nice and friendly, and knew exactly what my back needed to get me going again. I’m currently going twice a week, and every time everything is moving into place and feeling better and better every time. I’m so glad I found him. You will be too.<//Review>< time>

Dr. Hines is the best, tried a few other chiropractors and can say hands down this is by far the best I have ever felt after being adjusted. Would 100% recommend.<//Text>

Went in and didn't get worked on. The chiropractor told me he couldn't give me a note and I said okay thank you and walked out. They took that as a session and charged me anyway. I went in for an adjustment and was told I needed to pay $80(theres no way they would'velet me leave without paying). I wouldve fought it but I have had so much trouble with this particular branch. They even stayed there for what felt like 20 minutes badgering me about getting a subscription. I was only given 3 out 6 for 180 before... I'd rather not have to deal with it and just do walk ins...but they were very very very insistent....I still said no</review>

<review>When I first came to Dr. Hines I had unbearable pain in my lower back and legs and terrible posture that has been bad for as long as I can remember. In less than a month my back pain is nearly gone and my posture has improved greatly. I highly recommend Dr. Hines he has done an amazing job.< /review>< pics>

This chiropractor office is the best.Deborah is so sweet and does a great job at the front desk.dr Hines makes you feel so comfortable and always makes me feel better after I visit him. I went in their office because my friend Brandi referred me and said he helped her walk again. She couldn’t walk for weeks and started to see him and get better real soon so I gave it a shot. I was in the exact situation my back went out from riding my dirt bike and I couldn’t even walk or do anything so she told me to go see dr. Hines and I did. My back felt better after the first 2 visits and I’m still seeing him now. This place is also so affordable. I highly recommend the joint in San Marcos and keep going back. Thank you guys for all you do for us.James w.< /text>

<review>Today was my first time going In for an adjustment and I was happy I found this place. Dr. Heins was very nice and explained to me what he was doing and for what purpose and the goal. Also the receptionist was very sweet and patient with my very talkative 6 year old. I am looking forward on using my 1 month prepaid visits!! Such a great deal!
Great experience so far :)< /review>< pictures>

Went in on Saturday as a walk in. Filled out paper work saw Dr got Son adjusted and we were out. The adjustment was very different from others we have gotten before. Dr took her time and made sure my Son was well taken care of. I decided to buy a package for him especially because the price was very reasonable. With the 5 star treatment and price who wouldn't want to go back. Thank You for making my baby feel better.</review>

to find out they don't treat anyone who is

Don't know why & got the vaguest non explanation

SAY SO TO ANYONE CALLING IN AND
STATE SO ON THE MED. INFO FORM !
As the form breaks down treatments
Medicare covers & Not leading anyone
to assume all accepted for treatment there
I sought to just Pay and not bill Medicare
for Maintenance treatment - this is clearly
Understood
Anyway I just wasted time,  trip & hassle
for misinformation & it would make me
very Suspicious as to why they are doing
this & are So wary of working on anyone

Think there must have been some Medicare

The receptionist was very nice but the doctor himself was rude and short with me. The woman on the phone said my appointment would be about 20-30 minutes, but the doctor only spent 5 minutes with me. He asked me some questions and then only did a few things on my back. When he was done I asked him what I could do to improve my neck and back pain and he said I have too many crutches in my life (like icing my back when I’m in pain) and that I really need to focus on stretching more (even though I told him I’ve been stretching about 3 times a day). He also basically said I was too fat and that he doubted I would put in the work to change. I understand that weight can be a factor in back pain but there are more helpful ways to bring it up. My back did feel slightly better when he was done but his terrible attitude made it an overall bad experience. I have no plans to go back.<//text>

Was told i would still have my 3 appointments that I didn't use while my account was frozen and they would be added once I unfroze it for a total of 7. I froze it twice until November and come to find it was completely canceled in August....180 bucks down the drain and only 3 appointments. Great.<//Text>

<text>Great chiropractic work!  Dr. Heins is quick, no nonsense, and adjusts me with the pressure I need. I have used several chiropractors over the years and am very happy I found one that can adjust me beautifully,  charges very affordable rates, and is open late during the week to accommodate my work schedule.   The monthly price plan is fantastic, and the in between visit cost is minimal (should you need more than once a week). If you want a great adjustment with affordable visits, I highly recommend Dr. Heins!  You will not be disappointed. Your health is everything, and having a great chiropractor is key!  The staff is also very friendly, and you will be in and out within a few minutes!  5 stars all the way!<//text>< Pics>

<review>A great experience. Dr. Hines is excellent and his adjustment always makes me feel better right away. Deborah at the front desk is always there with a smile and an answer to every question.

Dr Hines is the man. As a construction worker with a physically demanding job it’s important me be to perform the best I can and be good to my body. Going once a week is part of my weekly routine. This is by far my favorite joint location that I’ve ever been to.

Thanks Dr. Hines< /text>

<Review>No help and rude. I was turned away because I am moving soon and Mr Hines didn’t want to “go through the nine yards” My Back started hurting about a week ago. I’m moving across the county and sought a chiropractor to visit a couple of times before I leave next week. All I was looking for was a little help and they turned me away. Don’t waste your money here.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1583802110164<//Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I just had such a horrible experience with the front desk. I can't tell if it's incompetence on her part or if the doctor is actually a badd chiropractor and is nervous about hurting people. Maybe she just has a badd attitude or is unsure how to do her job. I'm not sure if I was discriminated against or of this person is simply unhappy in general, but I did not receive a good customer service experience. They told me to come in for an adjustment on the phone and then when I arrived less than an hour before every other chiropractor in the city closes, she tells me the doctor might be too afraid to adjust me without seeing x-rays. I'm pretty sure the man is not that uncertain in his work however Deborah seems to be as I was basically gonna fill out paperwork and go home without an adjustment.  She kept saying she was going to ask the doctor if he could see me but missed blaringly obvious opportunities to do so. It was like asking a waiter for sauce twice and then watching them talk to a table for 5 minutes while you're eating dry French fries. In those moments I lost my chance of getting adjusted tonight. I gave her the paperwork back and now I'm sitting in my car upset without any adjustment.  I hope you sleep well with your terrible service because I'm definitely not going to..... My back hurts so badd. So unprofessional. So unhappy. Really need to get different help in the front. Obviously someone new, but I mean a different type of human emotionally that can handle new patients without getting frantic..... that was a terrible experience.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I’m rating this a 4 out of 5 because I loved the service but I also would like to have more explanation behind why we’re cracking a certain area and how it would help me etc. I would like more of a session where I feel like I’m being given advice. I do believe that the chiropractor did a great job but I just like to learn about my body too< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The Joint in San Marcos is amazing. I've been to many different chiropractors over the years. Nick gets my adjustment right every time. I know ill walk out feeling like a million bucks. Liana is always super friendly and helpful at the front desk. This by far is the best chiropractic office.</text>

<review>I called and told them I was in a lot of pain and was a new patient they told me to get there at a certain time and that I would be seen. I got their filled out the paperwork and and the receptionist told me the doctor could not see me because it was close to the time where he was going to have a lot of patients come in, I started crying because I was in so much pain and all they could say is ,when can we schedule you to come back. Horrible experience will never try the Joint Chiropractic ever again.<//review>< pics>

<review>San Marcos The Joint is awesome!! Dr. Sorenson is able to get my adjustment right every time, which is great because I’m a bigger guy. I find other chiropractors have a hard time adjusting me & don’t get it right. When I walk through the door in San Marcos Liana always greets me with a friendly hello, and is always very helpful at the front desk. I know I’m going to feel like new walking out after the adjustment.<//review><name>Matthew Swayger< /name>< gmapID>

I've seen a lot of chiropractors over the past two decades and Dr. Nick is one of the best. He is almost always able to adjust my neck, which is not an easy thing to do. I recommend a visit if you are in the area.< /review>

LOVE The Joint in San Marcos! Friendly staff, great service, clean place, and with the monthly membership, it's like paying $18 per visit! You'd be crazy not to become a member here!<//Text>

Dr. Sorensen is simply the best. I've been regularly going to his office to get adjusted for the past year. He's helped me relieve the constant discomfort in my back and neck but also helped fix different injuries in my wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. He's also given me good direction in how to maintain the gains that I've made between appointment through stretching and foam rolling. Plus Belle at the front desk always has smile on her face and is ready to welcome everyone. The Joint San Marcos is excellent!< /review>

The Joint is San Marcos is just a very pleasant location to go to. I know that I will be taken care of as soon as I walk through the doors. I am greeted immediately with a kind, friendly face and my adjustments with Dr. Sorenson always leave me feeling great afterwards. I am part of the membership plan, which is an amazing deal, and I truly look forward to coming here and getting my weekly adjustments.< /Text>

A little on the pricey side, but food is fresh and portions are big. I’ve had the porchetta sandwich before, and it was delicious! The crispy pork salad was a little overdressed, and there was just so much of the crispy pork, i could not finish the salad. My favorite has to be what i had today, which was the kale salad, $11. Alas, ur protein, avocado, tofu are add-ons, with the avocado as low as $1.50 extra, and salmon as much as $5.00. Ouch! I opted for the avocado with my kale salad, and asked for the dressing on the side. I did end up using all the dressing given, but i always rather dress a salad myself than risk getting it overdressed.<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>This is a steady eatery in the sparse Civic Center neighborhood. They've changed owners in the past few years and I have to say that their salads, which used to be superb, have gotten heavy on the dressing but their breakfast remains really solid with delicious home fries and yummy scrambled eggs. You can't beat their homemade potato chips. Also, the most reasonably priced Americano that I've found anywhere in SF. Great friendly staff!!<//text>< Pics>

I love Elmira.
They often have more than a few specials, and their seasonal specials can be excellent.
It's rather fast service, though if you get there right during the lunchtime rush you may be waiting in line for a while.
I don't think there's a single thing on the menu I haven't liked, though I'm partial to the chopped salad, the crispy pork salad, and the porchetta sandwich.<//Text>

<Text>I ordered catering from this restaurant because of the good reviews. For a place that is a rotisserie the star should be the chicken, however it was cold, dry and lacked flavor. It should have come in quarter pieces however I received two breast pieces out of an order of 16...the rest were thigh pieces. The vegetables were not cooked properly and all of my hot food arrived cold. I can’t even comment on the Mac and cheese. Extremely disappointed. Maybe eating in restaurant is better, but in terms of catering I’m not impressed.< /Text><GmapID>0x8085809afcab80ab:0x7b57ecb5a28a4bd< /GmapID><Response>None< /Response><user_id>102063880155262214369</user_id>< pictures>

Great roast chicken, sides, and salads!  My favorites are the mac and cheese (changes seasonally, I most recently had the pesto) and the quinoa salad.  I also enjoy ordering family style with some friends so we can sample a variety of items.< /review>

It's just okay. I've been here a handful of times. There aren't too many of this type of restaurant in this location, so that's nice. However, the food is just okay and slightly bland. I'm glad they don't over salt though. It's been a couple of months since I had it but the eggplant sandwich was disappointing. My salad today was a bit oily, lacked flavor (olives, feta and onions had flavor but the dressing was really bland - no seasoning or acid), and there was a piece of chicken mixed in. It's a good thing I'm not a vegetarian.< /Text>

Seek it out. Totally worth it. I went out of my way on this trip to San Fran to eat lunch here again. So worth it. Makes me wish I came more often. Porchetta sandwhich is the best bet. You must have the roasted potatoes as the side.</text>

< Review>
Elmira is the best thing to happen to this stretch of McAllister Street for years (culinary or otherwise). Mark cooks up fresh, seasonal dishes that make you want to come back for more ASAP -- as in, my wife, baby and I have been known to eat there three times in a week. Highlights for me: the portobello sandwich, faro or quinoa salads and the fact that their is lots of kale on the menu. If you are a lover of breakfast, get there by 11am! Sundays breakfast is served until 2. The eggs florentine is amazing!< /Review>

<username>Nicole Gutierrez</username><Time>1611802923007</Time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is my new favorite nail salon. I haven't been to this particular salon for some time and the interior decorations are so charming. Keeping up with covid regulations, they have these real neat mobile dividers in between clients and workers which I think is absolutely perfect. I got a pedicure with my boyfriend and I'm happy to say his toes look so cute now. After getting a pedicure, they gave me a complimentary little pedicure kit of the disposable tools that the workers used on my toes. Which is good to know that the same tools aren't used on every client; very hygienic and non-waistful to recive the kit myself so I may continue to use it.< /Text>< pictures>

The lady on the first left cube did my nails. I had gel done my nails were long but within a week of her doing my nails it all broke. The reason was she used the grinder and grinder my natural nails too thin.</Text>

They were helpful, for the prices they have, I expected top notch nails. Too expensive  for the nail job I got.  Im not giving them a send chance.< /Review>

<text>I went in to get a pedicure. The lady who did my pedicure was an older lady. She literally cut every single one of my toes. I had the pedicure on Sunday and today is Monday and I am still in pain. I have been putting neosporin on my nails because of the pain. I will not be returning to this place. On top of cutting me up, she was also rude.
My wife had her nails done by another lady and she was very happy and that’s why I gave them two stars.< /text>< Pictures>

i’m not giving this place a one star because they did a good job  it’s not the worst place that I’ve been to, but it’s also not the best.  I asked for a nude acrylic nails with my ring finger marble .  he said that would be fine my right hand looks awesome ,  but my left hand on the other side ,  my ring finger is it even marble  it looks like he just put gray  streaks on my finger under white . and my ring finger is starting to lift and it said on the board that it would be $30 but it was a three dollar fee for marble . I was thinking that would be OK and then it went up to 45. and also they brought a little boy that kept screaming and watching his videos on his iPad at full blast.</review>

Super rude!!! Never will I ever go again. That Asian lady was very disrespectful. Yes! I’m a guy who wants a pedicure. Guys can’t get pedicures? Is that wrong? Made me feel so ashamed!<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>They’re very aggressive and rough, The guy was shoving his nails into the corners of my nails and I’m not sure why he did that but it was so painful and it honestly feels like my thumb nail is ingrown. My acrylics came out very bad, they’re bumpy, lifted, too short, and just not even close to what I asked for. I might end up removing them myself. I won’t be coming back to glitter nails ever again.

this place is full of $#!&. They have one price up on the board and then charged me a completely different price. And when I lodged a dispute verbally, the entire staff started yelling toward me and arguing and causing a fuss. I do not recommend this place. There’s plenty of other shops that will do just as good a job .</review>

<text>I walked in despite the bad reviews this place had. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door. I saw a lady with a little boy behind one of the nail tables... I thought maybe she was a customer at first... Then she asked me how can she help me. I thought to myself oh great I'm going to get my nails done by a lady that won't be paying attention to me, but I went with it I told her I was wanting acrylics done she said okay have a seat I pulled up a picture and showed her what I wanted... Any way she did a great job in spite of the distractions! I have never been anywhere and there not be a major issue. But she was darn near perfect! Her name is Bee if you go to this salon she is great! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up from me!<//text>< Rate>

Wanted to get my eyebrows waxed but ended up waiting for 45 minutes to leave after getting yelled at for playing with the nail polishes at the entrance. I would have been okay if she had warned me on the first couple polishes I picked up but she decided the 7th nail was the time to say something

But they do do my eyebrows really nicely< /Text>

I wish I could give ZERO STARS this was The worst experience I have ever had at a nail salon. The lady Who helped me was rude and when I made it very clear I just wanted a fill and didn't want to take my nails off she still insisted on pulling my nails off not soaking them but pulling them off she even had one of my nails bleeding I couldn't take the torture and asked if she could please stop and just drill them down she said no it would take to long after that I walked out. I would never go here again this place was horrible!!!<//text>

Rude staff. I never even got service on account of they will take other people who came in after you right away, even if you were there first and have been waiting. Over a 30 min wait just for them to take someone who just walked in. Then will completely ignore you when you tell them you were first. It has happened twice. I wont be coming back.</review>

Was rude the last time I went. They refused serve and told me their schedule was was full when could see the the schedule book was empty. Rude people. If you pay enough money out to them the refuse to do any work on. The funny thing is I had been going there for about 5 years. They did the same to my sister and her daughter.<//text>

The salon is dirty.  One nail tech had her son on site. He was running around bored and pestering customers.   They were rude to my daughter and my mom. We were ignored and other people were given mani and/or pedis before us even though we were there first.  Then when mom went to pay they were again rude and impatient with my  mom who was having difficulty understanding what they  wanted.  I wouldn't recommend them at all and I won't be back.<//review>

these people need to be turned in they don't care at all the person that did my wax was awesome the rest of the times I've never had a good experience I've tried them a couple times to try to give them a chance but they messed up everytime, last time the lady pulled off my old nails and actually ripped up part of my real nails that is messed up! and then she glued back together... Horrible place</text>

<text>The staff  Was very rude  One of the men  doing my nails gave me attitude   They did my nails really bad this is the worst place I’ve ever been to they deserve no star when I left I said bye thank you they didn’t even look at me    And they even asked for the money before they even started doing my nails   It seems that they’re desperate for money   And they should treat people with respect  I hope nobody goes there ........< /text>< rate>

Ok so I went to get my nails done and they were 40 dollars and one of them broke literally the next morning and the lady who did them was very rude and rolled her eyes at many people who had came in.</text>

This site is my number one place.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I want to go to a proper lunch, this is the place that comes immediately to my head.  Great and many types of  food and a large list of dishes.professional staff members, and nice spirit. Also important, the tariff is good. I tell about this spot with great pleasure.< /Review>

< review>
Horrible service. For the past 2 times I’ve visited this waba the music is blasting and the lady taking your order keeps saying, “what?!”  Then today I go in for BOGO deal and as soon as she tells me the total I redeem the deal which set on a timer and she picks up the phone. I tell the deal is on a timer and she continues take an order on the phone. Then the deal expired and she says there’s nothing she can do. This is the last time I will visit this establishment.<//review>

1st time having Waba Grill. I ordered the beef with steam rise. Well let me tell you very disappointing. The rise was hard not very well cooked like a real steam rise and the meat was way to over cooked so made it taste way to dry. Avocado 🥑 was good< /text>

Second time I ordered from them and didn’t get the Sobe drink I paid for. Zack was very rude when I called and no manager on duty! Zack blamed the Uber East driver for not getting it from their frige. The poor driver hardly spoke English! Clearly they need a better system to get the drink and hand it to the driver when they give him the food!</Text>

<Review>Once again the dinner at The House was outstanding.I had the soft shell crab with spicy noodles and Tony got the delicious pork chop. I am so happy to see it thriving and maintaining it level of

It was ok.  Steak was terrible but the teriyaki chicken was great.  Hence the 3 stars.  If I had only the chicken would have given 4 or 5 but it would not have addressed the steak issue.</Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Really good. This was my first time to eat at Wabba Grill and I thought it was better than Flame Broiler. They certainly are not  Stingy with their sauces and provide a good size to go cups for the peppers, sauces, and green onions. Large portion sizes also.  I would definitely return.<//text>< Response>

<text>It seems that the chicken portions were reduced and it was burned. Compared to a location in Santa Ana, that place serves a full plate and isn't so chard. I was excited to hear that there would be a waba grill opening up near where I live, but that excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I found out my food was,
1. More expensive
2. Smaller portioned
and
3. Burned.</text><UserId.>104244637515815787577</UserId.><response>None<//response>< Rate>

< Review>
I'm gonna go ahead and sum things up Waba Grill > Flame Broiler. With my chicken and veggie bowl I was able to substitute in brown rice for only .25 cents extra. Teriyaki sauce is on the table, so you can pour it on periodically through out your meal. Chicken is well done, I often order teriyaki chicken and find it to be too rubbery or fatty for my taste, that was not the case here. Overall its a nice fast food style teriyaki place, don't hesitate if that's what you're looking.< /Review>

I ordered the steak plate. it looks nothing like the julien strips of meat but more chopped up bits. plate reminded me of flame broiler. no coke was available so I chose pepsi at the fountain. pepsi syrup was out but person in charge did not have key refill the pepsi bag in the box. so I chose mountain dew. this my first time here so waba failed to impress. Maybe waba will do better next time<//text>

<review>Bought my boyfriend a Yamaha Bolt for his birthday, and since it was a surprise it took a bit of extra planning and a lot of help from the staff there. Not only were they completely professional, knowledgeable, and efficient when it came to all the paperwork, they also went above and beyond when they agreed to help me surprise him with the bike itself. It was amazing! I even did a Facebook live stream so his friends and family could see his reaction, which was priceless! I can’t imagine another dealership putting the time and effort into helping me get the perfect bike and helping me ensure it was his best birthday ever. Thank you so much GA Motorsports! I will be a customer for life!</review>< user_name>

This place will more than meet your expectations !!! I tried a dealer in a bigger town and was sadly disappointed !!! G A MOTORSPORTS always had time to talk to me and made me feel as if my purchase mattered to them !!! Thanks to the staff I truly appreciate the honesty and the time spent on purchasing my new ZX 10R !!! AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TURNING A HEADACHE INTO A GREAT EXPERIENCE !!! If you want to feel like you and your purchase means something this is the place !!!</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Really bad experience with them. I went in to get a quad for my son, and I went through the usual process to finance. The problem is they never called me back, and I literally called everyday for a week. Still waiting for them to call me back. It’s been about 3 weeks, which they told me the paperwork was still processing. The only problem is that the communication is only one way. Very disappointed in how the whole buying process went down. Vince Marquez was the one I went through. It’s safe to say they lost any future business from me.</text>< pics>

Vinny and Michelle are awesome! We called before hand to make sure they had the bike we wanted and they were able to give us a great trade in value too! GA Motorsports doesn’t charge any bogus fees like other dealerships and only charge the freight fee. They do things the right way and give fair prices. We will definitely be back!<//text>

Had a really bad experience here with the bald dude that works there, he told he can hold a motorcycle I wanted to but for a week at the most it ended up being a Friday, so That Friday i arrived to the dealership with cash in hand was going to buy it out right, when I asked for it he told me it’s getting a couple things fixed on the brakes so he wrote my number down and told me he’ll call me when it’s done to come back I never got that call and the next day I went and they had sold it it’s really bad costumer service they don’t care.< /Review>

<Review>Thank you GA Motorsports for a wonderful purchase experience. After visiting several motorcycle dealerships in the valley I stopped at GA and I am glad I did. They had the motorcycle I wanted at a fair price and the paper work did not take very long. Thank you Vinny for making the purchase simple and pleasant. I will be referring my family and friends.< /Review><username>V Martin</username>< Gmap_id>

I was looking for a headset for my full face helmet.  I work in the same parking lot as GA Motorsports and went over to see what they had.  Jesse helped me by showing me all the ones that may work and explaining the differences to me.  He recommended one and it has been the best.  We were also on the way out of town on the bikes and stopped in because I was hoping to find a bracket of some kind to hold my phone.  He had it in stock and it has worked out well.  I appreciate the time he took with me helping to select products for my motorcycle.  I would recommend GA Motorsports to anyone.</text>

The best 5 star service I have ever received purchasing a motorcycle. Vinnie, Michelle, and Jesse are a class act. I purchased a 2018 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 from GA Motorsports. The purchase was easy and the service I have received from their service department has been awesome. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone. Simply awesome!Thank you GA !</Review>

I drove from Fresno to Visalia because I wanted to buy from a dealership with honesty and integrity. Thank you GA Motorsports for the great experience!</Text><Time>1528904698711<//Time>< user_id>

Jesse James Provencio  - Great customer service and he ALWAYS has the answers and the right attitude to satisfy ALL my motorcycle needs. He is my GO TO guy when it comes to motorcycle projects. I guess when you love what you do it's just natural to help others with their needs.

Keep up the good work man.

Thank you!< /text>

On line inventory does not exist.  Classic bait and switch.   I prefer to deal with HONEST dealers.

Add:

Within hours of my review this Tolbert character posted his.   In my view obvious plant.   One more reason to stay away from dishonest dealers.  Truly, Mr/Ms Consumer you been warned.</Review>

<Text>GA motorsprots has the best parts and service department. Every time I need something for my bikes the service manager Jesse is always very helpful and knowledgeable 9 times Outta 10 the parts are stocked in store and if not they are there lightning fast. Service department is awesome everytime my bike's been in the shop for either fork seal repair race bike prep oil changes Tire changes troubleshooting carburetors or any adjustments my bikes has worked flawlessly.< /Text><name>Austin Parker</name>< Pictures>

Took my bike in for an oil change, found out I had a cracked drainage hose, and GA Motorsports offered to repair the hose in addition to the oil change free of charge! Excellent customer service and professional staff!
Would recommend them to anyone needing service on their bike.</Review>

I take my bike to this place for service .. last time I was there, Jesse Provencio helped me out and he was great. He explained all the services that my bike needs, the prices, why I need them and all that good stuff. I will go back and get services done just because of the great customer service. Thank you Mr. Provencio< /review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>Bought my versys 300 here and the staff was not friendly at all. Purchased helmet and Bluetooth set, but after a month it stopped functioning properly. Call g a motor sports and they told me to call the manufacturer. I called the manufacturer but said it would be better if the retailer ordered it for me. Long story short I still have no new set and g a motor sports doesn’t seem to care. Definitely prefer the Kawasaki dealer in Tulare and wish I bought my bike there.

Update: received an email stating they would have my replacement in stock soon and would like to replace my sena Bluetooth device.<//text>< name>

< Review>
The service department is the worst, I took in my 2011 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 to get some new tires and they weren't able to take off my rear axle because they thought it was bent. The tech there was already giving me a price for a new axle, I told him not to order anything, to put my motorcycle back together and I would pick it up. So they charged me a 90 dollar labor fee for doing nothing to my bike.  I took it back home bought myself a motorcycle jack un mounted my tires with no problems, I went back and showed the tech that my axle wasn't bent and all he told me was "well it must of gotten loose on your ride back home".  I don't recommend this place to anyone for servicing, unless you want an oil change or a light bulb changed out because that's about the only thing they know how to do, if that!< /Review>

I bought my first bike there in 2009 from Jesse. The staff was knowledgable and friendly, they wereally not just trying to make a sale. Jesse now works in parts and is still as helpful as the first day I met him. When I had gotten a repair there, he kept me updated on the status on my bike and it came out great. I'd recommend GA motorsports to anyone!</Review>

<Text>Wow, reading all the other reviews what happened to me. I took a shower before going there. Worst customer service, hard to get calls back, you had to follow up yourself. I was told I had a deal and an arrangement , after driving 5 hours to pick up the motorcycle, buy insurance, go to the bank and take time off work. The deal is not the same, no notification, no prewarning , excuse me we are going to try to screw you over or take advantage of you. Salesman no statement of were so sorry , GM Vinny does not have the common decency to get off his ass and address us. Understand that Groppetti Auto owns this lot, I sure hope his folks at his car lots don't treat customers in same manner.

THE ABSOLUTE BEST in service, personality and quality! Like one of the reviewers below, I went in to the shop just to sit on a few bikes and get a feel for what I'd like to ride and it seems like just a few days later I was a proud owner of my very first Ninja 250R!! The guys, Vinnie, Marcelo and Jessie are by far THE BEST in the biz. they really take care of their customers! They walked me through the whole process, even after I took the bike home; they pointed me in the right direction and made sure all my Qs were answered! Even months later! I already dropped my bike and the first person I called was Marcelo; even though he did a lot of trash talkin (lol) he was there every step of the way! He even came out and assessed the damage and b.s'ed for a bit, helped ease the blow to my ego. All the guys are great! I'll stop by regularly just to ask Qs or see the new stuff they have on the floor; they're always happy to answer whatever crazy Qs I have. So... YES! Feb.2012 I walked out with a bike but it feels more like I walked into the G A motorsports family and it was THE BEST decision! So glad I did!

(Side note: I love Vinnie, but I did do some comparison shopping; Went as far up as Merced and as far south as SoCal and... Vinnie was THE MAN! He really is a miracle worker! No bull-- He will do everything he can to take care of you!!)<//Text>

Service department is just bad...

Took my bike in for warranty service. Took them forever to diagnose, forever to get parts, and then to do the service.... I got the bike back and it was missing hardware, including the every single one of the washers that go between the bolts and fairings.

Take your bike to Tulare.< /Review>

<review>Wow!! Each bite of my order (Lula beef especialty) was an explosion of delicious flavors that took my eating experience to a while new level.  The hosts both were very kind and took time to tell us about some history about the place and talk about the food. Thank you both.!!< /review><resp>{'time': 1623951250836, 'text': 'Thank you Mick..

I seriously wished I had ordered more food for myself cause it was that good, and do bear in mind that I usually do not eat too much. On top of that the host and staff have their own little personality and it quite literally feels like a small community in there. Being both authentic and genuine, the staff and food had left an unparalleled impression on myself and my brother. I will definitely be back for more!!!!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We liked the pictures and the reviews. But after eating, we felt like it was below our expectation. Kababs were okay. Taste if other items were just okay. We were the only one except another couple for dinner.</review>

If I could give it a zero I would. Went in there to pick up food, stood there for 15 minutes waiting to be acknowledged by the waitress who kept walking past me and saw me multiple times. Had to eventually call and tell them that i was there. Then had to wait another 25 minutes for the food to even be ready cause they hadn’t started it yet. Then when it was ready, the food wasn’t even labeled. Horrible service for a place that looked joyful. Wouldn’t recommend it if your order takeout or anything. If you come expect to stand there for about an hour just waiting. Ridiculous.< /Text>

This spot is the one I like best. I go to plenty of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very attentive and the cuisine they place on your table is so delicious. I would always prefer to have a nice meal in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.< /review>

<Text>My parents raved about this place and finally convinced me to come out and give it a shot - I am so very happy I did. I can’t have soy, dairy, or grains and I was pleasantly surprised with the options! I ended up having an amazing house salad with a chicken kabob and the owner came out smiling to come check on us. Great lunch experience!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-wqhndR-x0n0R0K311r2GubbHNPHZWQcyNXfM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Today was the worse experience here. I have been here so many times they know what I like to order. The babaganoodh and hummus both were fresh and good. Lamb and beef lula was extremely dry and old tasting. Tabbouleh was dry, pita bread tasted like cardboard and was NOT handmade nor fresh.  The baklava, was dry and old tasting. Napoleon has a scant amount of cream ratio to pastry. Service was very slow, but if it had been fresh and delicious I wouldn’t complain. I mentioned to the owner the dry lula, but he blamed it on the spices drying out the meat. I suspect that the restaurant isn’t doing well and they are cutting corners and keeping food too many days. It’s a shame. I’ll need to find a new favorite.< /review>

We love the shish kebab... it is the best in town!! Family owned business with great service. Definitely give this place a try... you will be glad you did!

2/14/2020 Update: My wife and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner here tonight. The food was delicious, and the service is impeccable!! And guess what... the best shish kebab in town!!</Review>

<text>Simple setting in a strip mall, HOWEVER, The food and service were first class.  We advised our server that we had a time limit for our meal and she not only served us quickly but got into the spirit of assisting us with our selection.  She guided us to a variety of lunch dishes.  We were served promptly and all four of us felt the meal exceed expectations in terms of flavors, quality of ingredients and balance of food on each plate.  We ordered four lunch dishes and four side dishes which gave us a fantastic selection of Armenian cuisine.  Two total surprises were a tarragon flavored soda drink which all four of us enjoyed enough to buy bottles to take away as presents to others, Second on the show stopper list was the desserts specifically the napoleon which is pastry cream filled baked confection which caused extreme sharing issues as we had not purchased one for each party.  We have eaten at other Fresno Armenian restaurants and this is the best value.</text>< pictures>

My daughter and I came in, thought we would try a new resturant. We were craving some good middle eastern food. We waited quite a long time to get our water, to order, to get our food, and wanted something more, and felt ignored. The female waitress didnt make much eye contact when she walked right past us. It looked as if there were a lot of regulars that probably tip well, and she spend a lot more time with all the other tables, and we felt ignored. The only saving grace was the young man that picked up the slack for her. He was kind. Anyway the food was good, just a lot of salad and not much meat on the plate. The service was disappointing. The owner went around obviously to all the tables except ours to ask how there meal was. Not a place I will return, very snooty personalitiies and under estimate that we in fact could be very good tippers. I did leave a good tip anyway.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809442e8fc2cdff1:0xd6c9a30c1abff4a7</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I want to say thank you very much to the chef, the lamb was delicious. Very juicy and tasty. I have very rarely seen lamb turn out 100% successfully. I really liked the lamaggio, it is not greasy and tasty. Bluhug pilaf is also very tasty. I haven't tried rice dolma, I don't like it. I highly recommend trying falafel, they cook it very tasty here. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. We were told that on Wednesdays they have live music and very atmospheric. Average bill is $ 20-25. If we are still in Fresno, we will definitely visit this institution.

(Original)
Хочу сказать спасибо большое повару, баранина была восхитительная. Очень сочная и вкусная. Я очень редко встречала чтобы баранина получилась на 100% удачно. Мне очень понравилось ламаджо, она не жирная и вкусная. Плов из блхуга тоже очень вкусный. Долму из риса не пробовала, я не люблю. Очень рекомендую попробовать фалафель, здесь его готовят очень вкусно. Персонал очень приветливый и дружелюбный. Нам сказали что по средам у них живая музыка и очень атмосферно. Средний чек 20-25$. Если будем ещё во Фресно обязательно посетим это заведение.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Mike Is a great guy. If you need a phone repair I would definitely recommend heading over to RepairAll. The price for the repair may be a little more, but nothing beats having great customer service that you can trust if you end up finding a button or something goes out after the repair. Not that common these days to find that in a business.<//review>< userid>

< Review>
On Saturday night I spilled some water on my iPhone. I thought no biggie & just wiped it off. A few hours later my phone completely shut down and started going in and out of re-boot. I tried everything I found online like hard-reset and even updated by connecting to iTunes. No-luck, iTunes was trying to force me to do a factory reset. This wasn’t an option for me because I would lose all my work on my phone. I started searching Yelp for a phone repair.... it was Saturday night and 9/10 spots were closed the following day (Sunday) but not repair all. I requested a quote through Yelp and got a response within 5 minutes to bring the phone in the following day on Sunday @11am to their Manteca branch. I dropped off my phone wotofo Leticia and she took care of it for me. She opened my phone and repaired the water damage. My phone is good as new and she charged me only $50 for it. Thank you for the wonderful service.< /Review>

<text>I went here because of there rating and wasn’t disappointed. I had just went somewhere else ( manteca computer services) and had some faulty screen replacement that ended up frying my motherboard and top it all off screen didn’t work properly.... So I explained my concern and frustration and the young lady here assured me she could fix and she had it fixed in 30 min unlike other place that took a week also said I would have a year warranty on the screen, so super happy wish I would have went there to begin with<//text></record>

<Review>Went in today to repair my granddaughter’s iPhone.
Was helped by Luis, who provided excellent customer service. He was helpful and very patient. He also helped me restore the phone after he repaired it and was friendly during the process.  I will definitely be back.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate><date>1610245612660</date>< username>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>So my phone got stepped on and my phone stopped working completely, first it was a blur then it would not turn back on. It was my first time taking it in and the customer service Greg provided was absolutely great! I thought it was going to take a while to get my phone fixed but it ONLY took 30 minutes and the price was reasonable! He did forget to give back my screen protector back because he had to leave as soon as my phone was fixed due to a family emergency ☹️ But overall, I would highly recommend this place if anything happens to your electronics.</Review>< Pictures>

Called 45 minutes before they closed, Luis assured me he could replace the screen on my granddaughter's iPhone 7 if we could get there soon. Now 20 minutes later we were there and it's Luis replaced the screen and the world was perfect once again. We've dealt with a lot of repair stores, this was by far the most efficient and affordable, we will be back!!!</review>

Prior to closing I received a call informing me that I had the incorrect battery and the technician provided me with specifics from the battery in my laptop, which I was able to look-up on Amazon. A week later the correct replacement came so I returned with my laptop and was able to pick it up Saturday afternoon. I appreciate the quick turnaround, I’ve noticed an improvement over the past few days.</Review></record>

Absolutely loved the customer service and the speedy repair. Claudia made sure I did not leave without a good protector case and screen protector. whatever questions i did have she was able to answer them. She even went above and beyond to help us in our time of need. I highly recommend this repair shop.<//Review>

<Text>Bryan was great, service was perfect some of these reviews on here are horrible, if your device is non function when you take it in, liability is on you if something is not working. Bryan quoted me over the phone for a screen and battery replacement on my iPhone, he was able to get me in right away, he kept me updated along the way which I thought was nice, phone was repaired and I had it back in a few hours, he even gave me a discount for replacing both items at the same time. Their policies are written out in the shop, as is their warranty, read it. I’ve already recommended this place to a few people.<//Text>< userid>

I was so excited to find my screen was not broken, but just the tempered glass screen protector I had bought here a few months ago.  I was so happy, I bought a screen protector for that phone and for another family member.  Claudia was superb in service and professionalism!</Review>

I left my phone and returned later. My phone looks and feels brand new! Moe even helped my find a better tempered glass screen protector with better warranty then Zag. Prices were more than fair and I would come back the moment I have an issue with my phone or iPad!<//text>< pictures>

When I went to pick it up the screen was broke. The guy working said since the phone was dead when I brought it in we couldn’t do pre tests to make sure the screen wasn’t broke they wouldn’t replace it. I know for a fact the LED part of my screen was just fine along with the outer part of my screen. He offered a discount on the screen even though he “didn’t break it.” I would recommend going somewhere else because who knows how many things they  “didn’t break” then offer to fix for a small discount later.<//Text>< Date>

<text>Phone screen is acting up and having a hard time responding to touch. Sometimes it will be fine but then it won’t let me press my screen and use my phone. I never had this problem until I got it fixed and it’s messing with my day-to-day usage. Even just typing this message it is causing me to constantly go back and fix what I have typed because it is not typing some of the letters. I even reset my phone thinking that would help but it didn’t. I am Very disappointed with the service, not worth the money spent on it.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1572193209623, 'text': 'Hello Mike, terribly sorry to hear you are having difficulties with our part.

<Review>Thank you RepairALL Phone Repair for helping me out. My phone died because of a chip malfunction, I took it to apple and they said it could not be fixed. I would have lost all my contacts and pictures! I'm so glad I took my phone to you guys, you replaced the chip and my phone is working again! Thank you very very much.</Review>< rating>

I recently dropped my iPhone & cracked the screen—again! Having done this two previous times, I was well acquainted with the process of having the screen replaced. I was pleased to find RepairALL within 10 min. of my home instead of having to drive to the next larger town. Not only was it convenient, the repair gentleman was delightful/knowledgeable and quickly replaced my screen (& case) for a very reasonable price! I am pleased to give RepairALL my highest recommendation!!< /Review>

I now have my go-to place when I need cell phone repairs done.  Greg was very helpful trying to repair my liquid damaged 5S (irreparable damage done).  He was very helpful in guidance as well when I was looking for a replacement phone.  Don''t hesitate - great service!<//Review>

The staff are very helpful and friendly. One employee, I believe his name is Ke’Shaun, replaced my phone screen in a matter of minutes and explained the process as he took it apart. They also have a pretty nice selection of cases and accessories. I definitely recommend RepairAll to anyone who needs phone repair!<//Review>

First visit they were courteous,  fast service, affordable prices

Had a second visit to have a tablet fixed. Parts had to be ordered. It took to two phone calls and a visit to find out after 4 weeks that the parts were never ordered. After a total of six weeks to get it back.<//review>

<Text>My last visit for a repair was positive. The technician was very responsive and went the extra mile to  make adjustments that did not even concern my main issue. I left feeling confident that my phone was repaired and was actually working better than when I went in. This technician was a young female and I don’t remember her name but I highly recommend her.  She worked quickly, proficiently, and seem to truly care about what she was doing.< /Text><user_id>103112904046936259018< /user_id><rating>4< /rating><time>1548260443347</time>< Pictures>

Great, friendly service.  And with expensive high tech devices, it is good to know that they are skilled.  My repair required soldering tiny connections and they did it well.  Kept me updated during the process and charged me very fairly.  This is now my go to repair center.</text>

I thought I needed to replace the charging port on my iphone. Greg  could have done that.  But he was honest and told me it only needed to be cleaned, which he did at no charge.  I wanted to buy something to say thanks and help keep this business growing.  So I bought a charging cable!!! Thanks Greg!!  I'll be back!</text>

<Review>I thought I would have to get a whole new phone after I dropped mine this last time. I called around to get quotes on my phone and found out that RepairAll was the only repair store to offer a free diagnosis in the area. So I took my IPhone 6 to RepairAll  the next day as soon as the store opened. I could tell that Gregory knew what he was doing because he fixed it within 15 minutes! The repair was affordable and the customer service was excellent. I definitely give it 5 stars!</Review>< pictures>

I cannot say this enough this place is awesome! For those of you who dont have insurance on your devices, and cant afford the 900+$ to replace it, Go to repair all!

I had talked to someone two days prior to coming in to get my screen fixed and was offered a good deal, called after a few days talked to someone new and asked about what the other guy had offered and he said he would honor it, I thought that was pretty awesome! Super fast, only took 20 minutes to fix and not super expensive like other places! Very nice as well. Highly recommend my screen looks good as new!!</Review>

The store is super clean & organized - they're always available & ready to assist. Repair costs very reasonable and are completed in a timely matter.  This is the part that sets RepairALL above it's competition - no matter if they get my business or not, I know Greg & staff will guide me into the correct direction.</review>

<text>I went in and he took 30 minutes to repair my phone which I thought was a little odd because most places say 2 hours. When I got my phone back my screen was ghosting and he repaired it again that day in 30 minutes again. My phone works perfect now great service and prices< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><rating>5</rating>< Name>

They were friendly and nice. I went in to replace a screen for an iPad Air first generation. Cost me $90 with a lifetime warranty. I happily paid it. Dropped it off and picked it up the next day. I will definitely go to them again.</Review>

2nd time in for service. Yes, I dropped it AGAIN.
I cannot say enough for their business and service,
Honestly!
Last time in I purchased a new screen. I was told a screen protector could save my screen from cracking, so I had them put one on.
When I dropped my phone, I could see the glass was shattered.
I brought it in to have the glass replaced and when the gentleman removed the screen protector, I was shocked. For once, I had been sold something that actually worked. I had a new screen protector placed and my phone is like new again.
I would recommend this company to all. You will not be disappointed.</Text>

<text>Really great customer service! I messaged Repair All Phone Repair and another local phone repair shop through the maps app with my phone info and what I needed fixed. Repair All promptly replied within 30 minutes with a quote and also notified me that the part would have to be ordered. The other place read my message, but never answered. So I went in store to Repair All and paid, about a week later I got a text saying my part was in. I called and asked if they had time to fix it now. Dropped it off and an hour later was ready to go. Employee even left the protective plastic on there, and left it up to me if I wanted to take it off or leave it on, which is a nice gesture in my opinion because I know some people who do like to leave it on. Basically, I would DEFINITELY recommend that you go here for any phone repairs.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I was referred to this shop by the ATT store almost a year ago. . I am a repeat customer and I will continue to use this repair shop for all my electronics. I needed a screen replaced on my iPhone 6. Repaired while I waited and with the coupon the cost was $30 less than batteries plus. Recently had another phone fixed and was given a generous discount for an inconvenience caused by a new employee. This shop stands behind their customers with courtesy and great service, I would recommend this shop to everyone.<//Text>< Time>

<Review>I found RepairAll online with great reviews and I walked in with an iPhone nightmare- multiple broken phones that all decided to have problems at the same time. I picked up my working phones an hour later and they are as good as new! The price was great too. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anybody that needs repairs done. I wish I had found them a long time ago!</Review>< Pics>

Hands down the best spot to go to if you need your devices fixed. I had a laptop screen cracked, brought him the laptop with the parts I already ordered and he replaced the screen on my laptop in less than a hour and it only cost me $45. He’s the go to guy! He fixed another laptop of mine as well and a screen on my iPhone. He knows what he’s doing.< /text>

The screen on my iPhone 6 was severely broken with dark lines going on the side of the screen, making it impossible to see or use the right side of the keyboard.

I definitely recommend this place! I just got my phone fixed today by Greg. He finished in less than an hour and the price is so worth it. I called other shops that were charging me a ridiculous price but this place is reasonable and  Definitely your pennies worth (:< /review>

<Text>Hands down the best spot to go to if you need your devices fixed. I had a laptop screen cracked, brought him the laptop with the parts I already ordered and he replaced the screen on my laptop in less than a hour and it only cost me $45. He’s the go to guy! He fixed another laptop of mine as well and a screen on my iPhone. He knows what he’s doing.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><user_name>Jay Black< /user_name>< GmapID>

< review>
Took iPhone 6s in to get a new battery. Left with phone and realized when I got home that it wasn’t charging properly. Couldn’t go back until next day. Store did not have another battery. I was told delivery would be in about 2 and to call back at 2:30. I called at 3 and was told, oh yes it’s here, I’ll get right to it. 5 minutes later I received a call that this battery was bad also. The manager drove from Manteca store to Modesto store and got another battery. I finally got my iPhone back with a good battery installed at 7:00pm. Manager was very apologetic and made extra effort to get me my phone back. Maybe they need to change their source of batteries.</review>

They screwed up my son's phone. Came in for a cracked screen. Came back to pick it up and they told us the black face they had for his phone was defective and it was their last. They then talked us into going with a white face temporarily. Another hour went by and it didn't work either. They put my son's cracked screen back on and told us to come back. As we were on our way home, my son noticed that now his home screen didn't work either. Went to batteries and bulbs today and got it fixed right in under and hour.<//text>

I shattered my IPhone 7 Plus screen completely. I came in to repairALL mid day on a Friday and he told me it would take 40 minutes to replace the screen. It was done 40 minutes later. Same cost as taking it to the apple store but way faster and more convenient. No hassle.</review>

I broke my phone screen and use my phone for business and needed to get it fixed. I went to RepairAll in Manteca on Hulsey road and they fixed it within minutes! I also invested in a fireproof case for better better protection and they gave me a great discount on the case and $10 off for signing up on their rewards program! They were great and I’d strongly recommend the guys at RepairAll! Thank you!!!</text>

< Review>
I broke my iPhone screen and wasn’t sure if there was more damage because before the screen cracked all the way my phone glitched out terribly, so today after my daughters soccer game I went to this location to get a quote and after speaking to the technician he told me that they could do a free diagnostic which was great because I wasn’t sure if I need a new phone or just a new screen. The diagnostic was done in less than 10 minutes and it turned out I just needed a new screen (great news) so I was in and out within 30 minutes which is notable because I couldn’t get an appointment with Apple until a week and a half from today! The technician was super friendly and made the whole experience wonderful from beginning to end..the apple store is good at what they do BUT as far as expedited repairs and customer service they are lacking.  I will be taking our phones here from now on not just based on that but the price as well!  I don’t always leave reviews but when I do it’s because the service was above and beyond or extremely lacking in quality and I’m happy to say that this was a great experience and have already told family and friends about it!
-thank you again!</Review>

<name>Marianne Dietrich</name><text>Going to Repairall in Manteca was
a great experience. Greg, the store
Manager, is a very personable and
Knowledgeable representative who
repaired my antiquated 5 iPhone
with 30 minutes, after advised by
my carrier to just get a new phone.

Well great customer service never
never goes out of style and I highly
recommend the repair service of
Repairall</text>< GmapID>

Went in, and 30 minutes later my broken screen was replaced and I was all fixed. Friendly guy, he made it easy. Cheaper than Asurian and faster. I should have gone RepairAll when my charge port gave out. I would have saved money.< /Text>

<Review>I waited 2 hours to jus be told my daughters phone had a touch disease, meanwhile at least 5 other people came into the store an the young man working alone was unable to fix any of the phones, I personally feel he doesn't know what he's doin an should receive more training, I'm quite upset I wasted that much time, for him to tell me to contact apple, very disappointing, if the staff isn't trained properly this business we be closed down in no time..</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>
