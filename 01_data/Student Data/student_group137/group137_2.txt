<Review>Hands down, Shadi is the Best Immigration Attorney. She is Professional, Responsive, Knowledgeable, Transparent, a great communicator, Kind and Caring. Parham was great and kind helping us with any questions. They both carry their whole staff with the same values too.

She made my whole Green Card process in every step so smooth, starting from filing to preparing, guiding us, and appearing to USCIS Interview.

During the whole time, She was working on my case, I felt like she is only working on my case, She was that attentive to details. In every step, Shadi made sure we are right on spot. I cannot thank her enough, She is beyond Amazing. I highly recommend Shadi for any Immigration needs.< /Review><Time>1622849274388< /Time>< pics>

I couldn’t have asked for anyone better than Shadi to handle my green card case! Shadi initially helped my mom obtain her green card, and through my mom I was able to apply for my green card and obtain it in two years. She is extremely professional, highly experienced, easily accessible, and very responsive. She is very organized and detail-oriented; I simply had to provide her with the required documents, and she handled the entire filing process which made it quite hassle-free for me. Shadi was always in touch with me throughout this long process, made sure I was always well-informed and perfectly understood every step of the process. She will make sure your case is bulletproof! She gave me the best preparation for my interview, and I felt quite confident on that day. I highly recommend having her accompany you to the interview; it will give you great peace of mind knowing that you’re in excellent hands at the most decisive step of the process. I’m extremely grateful to Shadi, Parham, and their wonderful team, for helping me and my family and I strongly recommend them with no hesitation. I cannot thank you enough!</Text>

In just a few words, Shadi has extensive knowledge and experience in her field of work. She is very honest, fair, and hard-working. I hired Shadi for my mother's immigration case (Green Card) when I encountered several difficulties such as Trump's travel ban on Muslim countries and Covid-19 travel ban in her case. The way Shadi carried out this case, you would assume that she worked on her mother's case. I truly appreciate her effort in this case and highly recommend her for immigration cases.<//review>

We were very particular about choosing the right attorney so we met with several law firms before finding someone we were confident in.  I am so thankful we chose Shadi to represent and help us with my husband’s greencard application. Shadi is extremely sharp, knowledgeable, and professional; yet personable and caring at the same time. She worked with us hands on from beginning to end, and was responsive each time we had questions. In addition, Parham was also extremely helpful and kind, assisting us to ensure we had all the documents needed for the application to the day of the interview.

We are happy to say that my husband received his greencard approval, and we have the Law Offices of Shadi to thank for that. We highly recommend Shadi to anyone in need of an immigration attorney!</text>

I am thankful for having Shadi work on my immigration case. Her and her team are experienced, incredibly knowledgeable and clearly very passionate about what they do. Shadi is very organized, and she breaks things into bite sizes, simplifying everything, and making the process a lot easier on the applicant(s). Another thing I want to highlight is how comfortable we always felt with her. With immigration matters, you have to disclose a lot about your life, and I never felt awkward about this with her.

Whether if your case involves challenging circumstances or not, immigration is not easy (imo). When on your own, you'll constantly find mixed information, updates, and it's just hard to get a grasp of how to make things right, but Shadi knows exactly how to tackle your case, and she will take care of you! I'm certain that without her help, I wouldn't be a citizen today. Forever grateful!<//text>

If you’ve ever had immigration issues, you understand the stress it brings. If you’re an undocumented child coming to the United States and realizing later as an adult your limitations as an undocumented person in this country, then multiply that stress by a million.

Shadi & Parham have been instrumental in obtaining my DACA. So much so, I thankfully have been approved for the 3rd time. Shadi is diligent, communicative, professional, and sets realistic expectations. With any DACA recipient, there is so much out of your control and it’s so imperative to trust those helping you through the process.

I’m beyond grateful to Shadi & Parham. If the day ever comes where I can obtain full legal residency, they would be the only team I would go to to help me there as well.< /review>

Shadi is amazing!

I know her from a friend. She would do her best to help you out of your case. She will answer any question that I have. She helped my wife to get Green Card within a year since we submitted all our document from Mar 2019 to Mar 2020. She prepared all the important documents that I need very carefully, so I don't need to worry about that. Everything went through smoothy. I would really appreciate her help and highly recommended.

The best one.

Thank you so much< /Review>

From the first call I had with Shadi, she was attentive and thorough to ensure that I fully understood the situation. Having to go through a case is rough for anyone so my husband and I are really grateful that we had Shadi by our side through this ordeal. Many thanks again to Shadi - my husband and I have been in such wonderful hands.<//review>

I worked on my adjustment of status case during the time of the Coronavirus pandemic with Shadi, Parham and the rest of the team. Shadi and Parham put the interest of her client first and are always responsive to any inquiries. My experience with them has truly been a positive one, especially in unprecedented times like this - the team was calm, clear and well-informed. Furthermore, she would go above and beyond to make sure her client is prepared throughout the process. It is my honor to strongly recommend the Law Offices of Shadi Sheidayi to anyone who has an immigration case.< /review>

She helped me with i-751 and n-400, all of them has been approved and let me all the way to the Naturalization Ceremony. Now,  I can proudly pronounce myself as the Citizen of United States.  Thank you for your honest, diligent and timely work, Shadi.  Also, thank you Parham who was always there to assist and help as well.   USCIS is very strict and you do not want to be denied, because you have made an honest mistake in your application.  It is always better to have an experienced attorney, like Shadi, to look after your application and help you gather all the necessary proof to make the process smooth and easy. That is why I would definitely recommend Law offices of Shadi Sheidayi to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was and is looking for legal help in any immigration matter.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I  cannot express more satisfaction in an attorney than with my experience with Shadi Sheidayi. I have been under her counsel for about 3 years and next month I am becoming an American citizen. I am eternally thankful for all of her services and advice on this journey. She is everything you could ask for in a lawyer: She is powerful, knowledgeable, experienced, organized and prepared. No question goes answered and I felt supported and cared about every step of the way. She does not take shortcuts and throughout the sometimes stressful immigration process, I have always felt in excellent hands. She accompanied me to my interview and i do think that her presence made a huge difference. She came highly recommended to me years ago and I am passing on that recommendation for those who look for an attorney that will fight for you and achieve results without losing the human connection!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Words can't describe how satisfied I am with Shadi's legal service!
I was recommended to her by my Brother, after him having a pretty difficult case. She was able to help him get LPR status and eventually get his Citizenship!
I HIGHLY recommend Shadi as an attorney, she's very knowledgeable, attentive to detail, and will always return your calls or emails with your questions. Thank you Shadi for helping my family and now helping me.
5 Stars all the way!<//text>< Pics>

If you're looking for a top-notch immigration attorney who is knowledgeable, thorough, and professional, look no further. Shadi and her team have proven to me that not all attorneys are the same. I have gone to cheaper attorneys, and totally regretted it. If you're organized, and expect your attorney to be on top of your case, with the latest of updates pertaining to immigration, and critical attention to detail, Shadi is worth every additional dollar. I'm extremely happy and glad I chose the Law Offices of Shadi Sheidayi over four years ago now. I go to her for every question and concern, and constantly receive detailed guidance and attention.<//review>

<text>Thanks to Shadi and her team, my husband is now a U.S. Citizen! We are absolutely thrilled that we found Shadi to be our immgration attorney to help my husband become a U.S. citizen. From Day 1 Shadi has been incredibly professional, helpful, and detail-oriented. Parham's assistance proved to be very beneficial as well and we really appreciated both their promptness with phone calls and emails responses.

Having Shadi as our immigration attorney made the process of getting my husband U.S. citizenship so smooth and we believe it was worth every penny having her behind us every step of the way. Her knowledge and experience of the complex immigration process along with her passion to fight for her clients is what sets her apart from everyone else. If you are looking for someone to represent you in any of your immigration needs, please look no further. You will not regret hiring Shadi Sheidayi and her team.</text>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I’m so fortunate to have found Shadi at a time when I needed her services the most. Shadi is exceedingly knowledgeable and professional. Beyond that she is also empathetic and considerate of her client’s needs and concerns. Her firm is a firm of excellence and I cannot recommend her highly enough! She answers all emails very quickly, making communication easy. Immigration forms and rules and regulations are so anxiety provoking and daunting, and so you want the best and this firm is exactly that! I have also referred many clients to her for immigration issues, and every one has provided positive feedback regarding their cases. I would not hesitate to use her firm for future immigration issues or to refer family, friends, and clients who need immigration advice.< /Text>< pics>

<review>From the first meeting with Shadi I knew we were in good hands and had made the right decision. My wife's green card was approved with no issues. She walked us through every step and made sure we understood everything, there were no surprises at all. Everything went so well. I would highly recommend The Offices of Shadi Sheidayi to anyone and will do if anyone asks if I know an immigration lawyer.

She explained all the stages of the marriage based green card and the effect of travel ban on my case.

My stepson was becoming 18 years old when I first contacted Ms. Sheidayi. At our first meeting she explained to me the whole immigration process for my wife and my stepson. If it wasn’t for Shadi, my stepson should have to stay for a long time in Brazil until he was able to come here. Ms. Sheidayi was prompt at responding to my emails and she even called me a few times to make sure that I’m following the deadlines. Usually lawyers are not even available to pick up calls let alone calling a client and reminding them of their deadlines. I can’t describe how happy we are that we found Ms. Sheidayi. If you are looking for a great lawyer, she is the one!< /review>

<Text>I'm a paralegal so I know exactly how it works in the legal field. Some attorneys would wait until the very last minute to work on your case, loading up attorney fee and they end up messing it around. My experience with Shadi, on the other hand, is very pleasant. She has kept me updated very regularly on my case. The reason why I chose her as my attorney was because her consultation was very up-front and straight to the point. All the other attorneys required me to come in and meet them in person before they can even answer my question. Not only did she review my case personally, Shadi made sure to organize and notify me all the necessary paperwork. She has been very responsive to my emails, phone calls and questions. While immigration law changes every year, Shadi knows exactly what has changed and what has not. She knows the in-and-out of the immigration field office, including all the procedures and the officers who you will be interviewing with. I highly recommend Shadi's service for your immigration needs.</Text><Time>1553033018961< /Time>< response>

<text>Ms.Sheidayi helped my parents with their immigration cases. We had a lot of problems with the Affidavit of Support stage of their case as it was quite complicated and we could not figure it out by ourselves. After doing my research online I found Ms. Sheidayi and contacted her. We had a consultation and during the one hour consultation she explained to me exactly what we needed to do and what documents we needed to gather. We hired her for that stage of the case and did as she told us to do. Thanks to her help, my parents’ affidavit of support documents are approved and now we are just waiting for their interview to be scheduled. It has been a pleasure working with Ms.Sheidayi and I absolutely recommend her.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Shadi patiently answered all our questions and provided us with a perfect road map. She helped us with my Fiancé visa and Adjustment of Status. The whole process was complicated and we were anxious at some points but Shadi always helped us to overcome our undue stress. We knew that we were in good hands. Thanks to her, now I have my two year green card. Shadi, I will see you soon for my ten year green card.< /text><GmapID>0x80dcdef59cfabceb:0xa9eed9163fc54355</GmapID>< UserId.>

Ms. Sheidayi helped us to prepare waivers for travel ban for my wife’s parents from Iran. She worked very fast and efficiently to prepare both waivers. We are extremely satisfied with her services.</review>

My then fiancé found Shadi through Yelp. From our initial consultation we were sure that we had found the right attorney. Shadi patiently answered all our questions and provided us with a perfect road map. She helped us with my Fiancé visa and Adjustment of Status. The whole process was complicated and we were anxious at some points but Shadi always helped us to overcome our undue stress. We knew that we were in good hands. Thanks to her, now I have my two year green card. Shadi, I will see you soon for my ten year green card.< /text>

Outragoues! She took my $500 and ran with it without getting any work done except two consultations and one was over the phone. These are FACTS.
She then probably called a bunch of friends to leave reviews for her to cover up a negative review. Shady lawyer as her name states. Dont blame me for others reviews of your horrible service. I got all the work done at a fraction of what you charge. DONT CALL OR BLAME ME. I dont reccomend her at all when there are other great lawyers who do the same exact thing.< /Text>< response>
{'time': 1544505962376, 'text': "Hello Sam, it's very unfortunate that you are portraying a false depiction. No refund was due because you never hired us for your case, however, we offered to apply the consultation fee and the fee you paid for my initial review of your legal documents towards any attorney fees for your case, which again, there weren't any because you never retained us for your case.  We always strive to provide the best service for our clients as that is our ultimate goal, which is why we are surprised by your review. We wish you the very best in all of your future endeavors."}</response>

Shadi Sheidayi is an expert lawyer in the area of family and employment based immigration. She really helped me in my adjustment of status case i.e. I-485.  Shadi Sheidayi is extremely knowledgeable,  very well organized and compassionate to understand the situation of immigration case. If you are looking for a professional immigration attorney who is thorough and puts the interest of client before anything else then your search stops here. Shadi Shedayi accompanied me and my wife during I-485 interview. On the day of my I-485 interview, USCIS's biomatric system was down. Shadi Shedayi was with us for over 3 hours waiting for system to be up and running again. We had to go for biomatric again. She never left us alone dealing with USCIS officers. Even after our interview, she followed up with USCIS to call me and my wife for biomatric interview. I am so thankful for all effort she put in to our case.</review>

My doctor of 20 years had just retired and I am glad that I chose Dr. Richard Baick as my new primary physician. Dr. Baick is thorough, knowledgeable and caring with a kind demeanor that shows he is fully engaged with the patient. He took the time to review my medical records and explained the follow-up care and treatment plan. The attending nurse, Al was friendly and welcoming, and had a great sense of humor.</text>

<text>Dr. Baick grew up here and went to Uni High before getting his MD and fortunately for me deciding to return to his hometown to practice.

He is thorough and listens intently while being humorous and caring.  Most importantly he will lead you down the correct path. I've had two life changing health problems solved that other doctors were sure was something else. One issue I thought would keep me from walking ever again to taking up skiing at 35.

His assisting nurse Abbie is also on the spot and follows up if you have a question, need a refill or are just getting some bloodwork done.

Together with Rhiannon covering the front office they make a great team that is a pleasure to see.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcdcf5409ad56b:0x4894307a4e32b0b</gmap_id><Time>1611115131202</Time>< user_id>

Dr. Baick is an amazing doctor. He is an excellent listener. After he looks at all the information he explains everything so that you understand what is happening with your body. He then over your options and how so you can make an informed decision. He works my Oncologist to help me get the best care possible.<//Text>

My family has been under Dr. Baick's care for about 10 years.  We honestly can't ask for a better family doctor because he is thorough, knowledgable and compassionate.  He listens and does not rush us, and he works with us to take care of our medical needs.  He is definitely one of the very best doctors that we have the privilege to meet.</text>

Went in with an abnormal blood test result from another facility.  Dr. Baick listened thoroughly to the situation, performed palpation of the area, followed by a blood test in the lab located on the same floor.  The results came back next day, confirming Dr. Baick's suspicion that the prior test result was erroneous.  The experience couldn't have been more pleasant.  Thank you.</text>

Dr. Baick, although he was running behind, was very friendly, and took the time to talk about all our concerns. He did not rush, and I enjoyed talking with him about my son.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Doctor Baick his amazing.  Coming from a family with multiple doctors and surgeons his advice and diagnostics have always been spot on.  My wife and I have both gone to Richard for the last 4 years or longer.
He was able to help identify and fix medical issues that we have spent years and visits to multiple other doctors for answers.  He is very professional.  He takes his time to explain any issues in a way that is easy to understand.  He has been prompt at returning any medical test or exams that have been completed.  Our family is very happy to have him as our doctor.< /text>< response>

This is my Yelp review for Dr Back in 2012. It still holds true today.

My children and I have been going to Dr Baick for over 12 (19 as of March 2019) years now and I recommend him to everyone who is looking for a doctor.  About 7 years ago when I went to see him he asked who was my regular doctor, I told him "If any other doctor asked me that question I would tell them that it was you!" His response after looking at my charts was that he had not seen me for over 4 years (in my defense I hadn't been sick) and if he was to be my doctor he would expect to see me at least annually.  With that I have seen him more than annually ever since and he has worked with me to get my health better than it has been my entire adult life.

He is a doctor that takes more time with you then he should.  He spends this time making sure you understand how you are doing in non medical jargon and to learn more about who your are as well as the how you are. He knows about my activities, my children, their health, he even talks with me about my rescue dog and his experience with training them (dogs).  He gets to know his patients at a personal level and I believe it makes him a better doctor because he can tell when you are healthy and when you are not.  I have had him notice when I took one of my children to the walk in (a few doors down from his office) and pull them in to take care of them because they are his patients.

His office staff is friendly and professional.  They have started using an online system, PatientFusion, which allows me to see my labs, past appointments, prognosis, and more.   I like that I can access this information on line.

I know that he is part of the Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer Network and I have never been balanced billed for the write off amounts (of course you have to pay for Copay's and Deductibles) as I have been by other doctors.<//Text>

<Response>None</Response><review>My complete family primary physician was Dr. Baick. When we start going to him we found him very good, detail oriented person but with time everything went wrong. He never returned call back to discuss the blood report for annual checkup even after I requested to do so. Recently my wife went to another doctor for some reason and they told her that she is in early stage of sugar which he never pointed out to us.</review>< time>

< Review>
They do serve both hookah and alcohol, but our waitress did not know what Pinot Noir is LOL, they only have 2 types of wine: red and white, where red is $8 a glass and white is $35 a glass. A small bottle of water is $7. Unbelievable nayebalovo.
Hookah lasts only 20 minutes of non-stop smoking (or smoking for 2-3 people) and costs 40 bucks. They do replace coals, but it doesn't do anything for burnt out tobacco. Food is subpar.
The place itself looks nice and there are a couple areas to take pictures, hence the 1 star.
I am planning another night out with friends and thought to come here, but just looked at the photo of our last receipt and realized that this place is not worth coming back.
Although it's nice to not have to wear a mask.< /Review>

<Review>Amazing service, clean environment, delicious food, incredible atmosphere. Veranda has become my favorite place in Glendale to celebrate any occasions with friends and family. Their menu is so unique. Each dish is finessed to perfection. We will definitely be coming back frequently! Thank you guys for the amazing service and remarkable food!< /Review>< rating>

This is the most rude and unprofessional venue in Glendale.
I came here on an afternoon for a dinner party, the entire terrace was booked for my company, the terrace was covered with curtains and during sunset the sun was right on our face, they didn’t cover the western part of the terrace.
Food wise, I specifically told the waiter that I am vegetarian and don’t prefer cilantro nor dill, but here we go the waiter comes and shoves chicken salad and shrimps in my plate and I told him “hey, I don’t eat that” and his response was “it’s ok”. Talking about the shrimps, I saw the shrimp delivery made to the venue when I was looking for the main entrance, and to be honest the scene of shrimp delivery did not look nice nor “clean”.
Drink wise, they serve wine in a freaking black coated cups!!!! I mean who does that!!!!
Such a waste of time for me, staff are intentionally very rude in general, save your money and don’t go there.

REPLY TO OWNER
You are a ridiculous person and very far away from being a professional in service industry. I’m happy you answered to me so I can use your answer and report to USDA Food Safety program. I’m really happy you took this step so at least you are learning from your mistakes, hopefully.</review>

This restaurant is my first choice restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to this restaurant. when  I I need a good lunch, this restaurant comes straightaway to my mind. best and diverse  food and a large list of dishes.great team, and nice mood. In addition to that, the price is reasonable. I recommend this restaurant with pleasure.<//review>

< review>
This is the most rude and unprofessional venue in Glendale.
I came here on an afternoon for a dinner party, the entire terrace was booked for my company, the terrace was covered with curtains and during sunset the sun was right on our face, they didn’t cover the western part of the terrace.
Food wise, I specifically told the waiter that I am vegetarian and don’t prefer cilantro nor dill, but here we go the waiter comes and shoves chicken salad and shrimps in my plate and I told him “hey, I don’t eat that” and his response was “it’s ok”. Talking about the shrimps, I saw the shrimp delivery made to the venue when I was looking for the main entrance, and to be honest the scene of shrimp delivery did not look nice nor “clean”.
Drink wise, they serve wine in a freaking black coated cups!!!! I mean who does that!!!!
Such a waste of time for me, staff are intentionally very rude in general, save your money and don’t go there.

REPLY TO OWNER
You are a ridiculous person and very far away from being a professional in service industry. I’m happy you answered to me so I can use your answer and report to USDA Food Safety program. I’m really happy you took this step so at least you are learning from your mistakes, hopefully.<//review>

<review>I am so pleased with this place and the service I've received!! I had a special request over the phone to surprise a friend who's celebrating a birthday at this beautiful restaurant! A staff member named Vahan handled my request very professionally  and gave some helpful hints. Latterly  in seconds I received the receipt for the order I placed.
And I was told they have delicious food..
Highly recommended !!!< /review>< Pictures>

Very poor service, a portion for one person is not enough or freezing, were recently and very disappointed. Here only the music is very good and that’s all. Even do not give one rating, it is a very high rating for them.< /text>

What a great place with views of downtown Glendale.  We had a party in the covered patio area and enjoyed the modern atmosphere and delicious food that wasn't like every other banquet hall. Would definitely recommend.<//text>

<text>Adrian was the Verizon rep to find the solution to my super complex problem!  Let me tell you that the online chat rep as well as the corporate Verizon store attempted but to NO AVAIL!!!
I recommend this specific Verizon store as I have personally and happily experienced they’re attention to detail and not letting me leave until the problem was fixed!

We went to Russell Cellular because they were the only retailer we could find who had the iPhone 12 red with 256GB.  Marilyn G. sold us the phones and migrated the data from our old phones to the new ones which was a great service that we found out later cost $25 each phone. This was a good service, however, we should have been told it would cost $25.  In all the years we have owned cell phones, we were never charged for this migration. We were also told that we could pay for everything but the final $100 per phone that would be on an installment plan or we could pay it off in the next month. Never had this type of charge before either.  Our bill showed the $960 cost per phone and the $100 Installment Amount per phone. In the Your Total column the $100 showed a credit--I will have to pursue this because I just paid the $200 to cover both phones.

On my Verizon bill I found a $40 upgrade fee per phone and  we were signed up for the Verizon Protect Plan, neither of which we were told or asked about.  The Verizon Representative said it was the Cellular Company that added these charges, but Marilyn G. just told me at Russell Cellular that it was Verizon and that I could call and have it reversed.  I had already spent a lot of time with the Verizon Representative and she was not able to reverse the charge.  Marilyn G. removed the monthly Verizon Protect Plan from both of our phones and supposedly reversed the first charges that were made on our Verizon Bill. I expressed my unhappiness with these additional charges that were added without our knowledge and told Marilyn G. that she needs to tell/ask her customers for any additional charges added to the cost of new phones.

My advise if you enter Russell Cellular is to ask for any additional charges to be explained before they are added to your bill.  And I would still like to understand why we couldn't pay off both phones but instead had to finance $200 of the cost. Shady dealings in my book!

**Followup--Jan. 13, 2021--I sent in a complaint on the web to the Better Business Bureau and on Yelp on Jan. 12 and received a call from Verizon Headquarters on Jan 13.  The Verizon Rep. reversed all of the charges that we did not authorize and gave me the new amount of my next Verizon bill.  They responded immediately after they got the complaint from the BBB which was very impressive!  The Rep indicated that they would be contacting Russell Cellular for "counseling."  And interestingly, I was going to add the above information to my Yelp complaint, but can't find Russell Cellular on the Yelp website anywhere.< /text>

<Text>I had the strangest issue with my cell phone, it seemed like it would most likely not be repairable and I'd have to purchase a new one. I walked in and it was VERY busy. I wish I could remember the man's name who helped me, he was courteous, kind, patient and a rockstar all at the same time. As frustrating and annoying as my problem was, he managed to fix it and for free. He explained that 3 other customers came in earlier with the same problem and he knew what to do. He saved me $800 $$$$!!! At a time like this I really appreciated that.<//Text>< user_name>

<Text>Brian was so incredibly helpful in every aspect of my visit to Verizon! He helped me pick my phone, he helped set up my phone and figured out some things I’ve never been able to figure out! Super pleased and happy with Brian and Verizon in Costa Mesa.</Text>< Time>

Brian, Richard and Mike were absolutely amazing. I literally can't believe how much they were able to help me out not only with my plan but getting me into a new phone at almost no cost. I didn't think getting such good service from Verizon was possible, but at this store with these gentleman, you I received immaculate service and care. Thanks guys!<//review>

< Review>
BEWARE!! This is not an official Verizon store. It is an authorized dealer only! It is independently run, and has nothing to choose from. Don't come here. They did not have the phone that I wanted and tried to sell me on all of these bizarre phones that I never heard of. They would not let us out the door without trying to sell us some things that we really did not want. They even offered to drive to a store 40 minutes away to pick up the phone that I wanted while we waited for him to come back!! Uh, no thank you! Make sure that you go to the official Verizon store and not an authorized dealer. Beware!<//Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!!!!

Absolutely horrible customer service.  They have no idea what they are doing. I came into the store to buy an iPhone.  They basically ordered it online for me... something I could have done. Now why would you make me order it online when I could have gotten one from the store???? Makes zero sense. Then when I went to pick up the phone they had no idea what to do with it. Total joke and horrible experience. Should have driven a few extra miles to go to the Verizon store on Harbor.  They forced me to buy accessories that I did not want and told me that I could not have the iPhone X without purchasing the accessories. When I went to return the accessories the guy I dealt with, AK D. told me that I can't, that's when we exchanged a few works. He said "we'll, if you're going to act like that..." He then tried to tell me that he was the one that sold me the accessories and I told him know. After a few minutes of that, he said his "father is the store owner, so he knows everything and everyone" (LOL!!!!!). AK works there because daddy gave him a job. That's sad!!!!! ok- Back to reporting this store and AK to the Verizon Headquarters.</Review>< Pictures>

I came into The Verizon store today with a problem with 2 iphones, as I walked in SIMON manzano gave me a warm greeting and was very knowledgeable about the problems I was having. As he was helping me out The store manager Esteban Gavilanez came to help me change my passwords (such a hassle for me ) I recommend EVERYONE to come to this New verizon Location ! I give them 5 stars for effort and 5 stars for customer service !!

Keep up the great work :)<//Text>

Byram has been businesslike and good to me. In the medical field, they need to coordinate both with your doctor and your medical insurance. Problems arise because so many people are involved, including front desk and medical subordinates. This requires the patient (me) to be involved and, when necessary, prod others to make ends meet. Once I got it all worked out, my re-orders have been seamlessly easy. The company I used before Byram was bad. Byram is good if you work with them. And because I live in SoCal, my supplies come fast.</Text>

i have never once had a smooth ordering experience through byram. everything is always messed up at least twice in the process of ordering, whether i don’t receive the right supplies or they don’t have the website updated with my supplies or they don’t ship fast enough or something else. and everything always becomes an emergency and literally every phone conversation i ever have ends in tears.</Text>

<review>I am very frustrated. They have not sent my needed medical supplies. I am using an insulin pump system that depends on CGM readings. For the first time in 5 years I have run out of CGM sensors and they will not send more for another week! Kaiser made a BIG mistake hiring them! After reading other reviews, I wonder if they will send them on the date their app says. I'm calling Dexcom and Kaiser to complain. DO NOT CHOOSE BYRAM!!!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1626098547924, 'text': 'Hi beth, we are very sorry to hear about your experience.

I would NOT recommend this company at all.  They REFUSE to change the ship date of her 3 month supplies until she is right at the 3 month mark.  So, if the shipment is late or we run into issues with her sensor and we are on the last sensor then we are just out of luck and have to wait until we get her next shipment.  I even had my insurance company call them to 'Approve' the release date of the supplies sooner and they still REFUSED to change the ship date sooner.  They claim that I would have to have my insurance company call every 3 months to approve the shipment sooner, but that is not true since I just had them call and they still refused to change the ship date for the next shipment.  My insurance company, United Healthcare, was even shocked about this situation and they said they hadn't ever heard of anything like this before.  I do NOT need this extra headache every 3 months with this company.  I will be looking for a new medical supply company TODAY to start this process over for her next shipment.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>By far the worst experience I've ever had with medical supplies or really any other customer service.  I am on month 3 of trying to resolve an issue.  A pump was ordered for me by mistake from my doctors office (no consent from me) and after I received the order, I contact Byram and shipped the pump back to the company.  3 months later, I am still be billed and threatened with collections for a pump I did not order and do not have in my possession.  I have been trying to resolve and keep being passed around to different departments and no one will commit to resolving the issue.  Stay far away from this company.</review><Response>{'time': 1612209832291, 'text': 'Hi Stephanee, we are very sorry to hear about your experience.

Everyone should call Dexcom directly (or parent company of your medical device) and make a complaint about Byram Health Care. Just finished making one today. If everyone joins in we can get Dexcom to remove them as a supplier and get there contracts pulled.

These people are the worst. No matter how many times you give them the correct information even what they’re asking for immediately they still can't help you. Nobody on the phone can help you with anything at all. Why have a phone staff if they cannot help you? We have been trying to get our sons supplies for over a month and we still don't have them. The doctor and our insurance provider have contacted them directly and they still can't figure out how to get our supplies.

Every time we call it's a new story and a new excuse. They even go so far as to tell us their shipping it and then the next day they cancel the order< /review>

This is possibly the worst customer service experience I've ever had in 2020. I ordered my breast pump through insurance (Kaiser), was told to wait 3-4 days as deliveries had slowed with the new closures throughout California. So I waited, and gave customer service a call after 4 days, as tracking said it was delivered to my apartment when it wasn't. I was told to expect a redelivery within 24 to 48 hours with signature required upon delivery. I waited 3 days, called again, and told to wait another 24 hours after the supplier only made the tracking label but did not prepare the shipment. I still have not gotten the pump after a week and a half.

I can buy their cheapest pump off Amazon (Zomee) for 90$ and get it faster than their delivery service. Very disappointing experience.</Text>

3 calls to them today. Waited 22 minutes on the first.  Left word on the second after 15 minutes.  They returned the call 2 hours later and it was the wrong person and couldn't help.  Third call waiting 28 minutes and she answered and said she would transfer me!!  Got transferred and the lady answered my one question. All that wasted time.  What ever happened to customer service  AND don't blame Covid.<//Text>

But, No. Careless customer service and management team. Reckless, inconsiderate and above all not caring for the patient and their need for supply. After receiving molded formula for my son, I made a comment to the customer service representative. They must write notes on their system or whatever. After that my son supplies were delayed. I put in order, they won't process till the day I'm supposed to receive the order. Mind you we've been placing orders since 2007. I started to have to call several times. Even called management, and nothing. At one point my son's order was delayed by 3 weeks due to their neglect. When photo the cooperate office. I got emotional and started crying out of anger and hurt. She stated "are you done". They could careless. My son is tube fed and relying on all feeding supply. Changed his supplier.

<username>jason flores< /username><review>Worst experience I’ve ever had with medical supplies. Customer service is rude, takes forever and a manager/supervisor is needed for everything and is never available. Called 3 times, first they said I would get a call within 24hours, nothing. Second time I would get a call within 72 hours, nothing. 3rd time they said 72 hours and nothing. I have never gotten a call back and a supervisor has never been around in all the times I have called. Worst part is every complain I spoke to them about every single rep said they know it’s horrible, they understand and feel sorry, they hear it all the time, but yet the company has done nothing about it? SHADY COMPANY ALL AROUND, DON’T waste your time or money and save yourself the headache. I pay more now to go through someone else and have never been happier.< /review></record></dataset><record>

It seems Byram bought out a company I used to do business with and buy mistake I called the old number and reached Byram! I was horrified by just the way they answered the phone. Compared to my current provider Western Drug & Medical Supply. Byram has a completely backward attitude and they are extremely Rude and matter of fact tone. I started to ask if they had bought out my current provider and was interrupted by... “First and Last Name or Phone Number Please”
ANYONE that has a choice, please take my advice and call Western Drug & Medical Supply. They are friendly compassionate and they realize they are there to help you with your needs. I stand by this and would HATE to be in business with Byram.<//Text>

<Text>Lately Kaiser Permanente  chose  Bayram as their Medical Supply Co.
unfortunately Byram not only they have unprofessional staff but also dishonest billing department. they send me wrong medical supplies in March, 2020 and I called right away and received return label and shipped back, they received the returned product, since then for the last four months they keep billing me $1,462.93 as past due, every time I call they promise to issue credit once they get the authorization from their supervisor which never happened. Be careful with this company and always check your invoices.</Text><rate>1<//rate><time>1596651504409<//time></record></dataset><record>

I registered my mother back in July 2019. gave them all her insurance information.  once that was done, I placed her order of censors for her diabetes every month.  In January, my mother received a bill for almost $3,000 for her censors. she is an 83 year old woman with only her social security as her income.   No one called to say "hey your insurance is not covering it or you gave us the wrong information".  They just let us order every month.  I called to rectify the situation and they told my it was my responsibility to make sure that the insurance was valid.  Now we don't know how to pay it.  SO STRESSED OUT< /text>

Amazing service, their representative was kind, great customer service skills. Placing my order by phone was easier than doing online. I received my order incredibly fast, it came in two days. I was expecting up to a week-10 days, and was totally impressed it came much earlier. Thank you Byrum Healthcare 😀</text>

Byram is the absolute worst company to use when in need of medical supplies. I receive CGM supplies from this company and have used them for 6 months. They highly encouraged me to sign up for easy fill to avoid any lapse in time in receiving my supplies. Unfortunately, the order was canceled. I was then told to order online which I did. I received a confirmation email which was also canceled. I then spoke to a representative who stated my order has been input incorrectly not allowing it to be processed. She resubmitted the order and said it will be sent out via overnight on Monay.... today. I have yet to receive an email confirming the order so when I called they now said they needed to wait for documents from my Dr. This was never communicated to me. When I called my Dr office, they let me know they have not yet received a request for documents.

This company clearly has no idea the importance of medical supplies for some people. I tried to give them the benefit of doubt from day 1. This is ridiculous as its always something that happens and they never accept fault.

HORRIBLE COMPANY!!!! SAVE TIME AND GO ELSEWHERE.</text>

<Review>Horrible customer service! Every time I called I was on the phone for over an hour and would just go in circles verifying my information over and over again. Of course there were several issues with my order and it was a pain to cancel. I ended up having to get my insurance company involved to sort things out directly with Bryam. I would not recommend this service to any one stay away!</Review><Time>1596044876198< /Time>< user_id>

Terrible customer service and extremely unreliable. I do not recommend this organization by any means, there are many better out there. They have delayed the shipment of my healthcare supplies twice now sending me to the urgent care. They do not care about their customers and cannot be trusted as a reputable supplier.< /Review>

My son who is trying to order insulin pump supplies for the last 6 weeks has not been able to get on their system. For two weeks, he has called  daily only to be told that he is has no account. Yesterday, they told him they don't take his insurance.  He needs the supplies fast for his insulin pump.< /Review>

<review>This is the worst medical supply company. Unfortunately I have no option but to use them. They have over charged me and have two accounts for me. Called them and asked to merge my accounts earlier and have not heard back from them. How can a terrible company with this many bad reviews exist. This is the problem with healthcare. A business who’s job is to supply patients with supplies to live is overcharging and there is no regulation or oversight. I’m sure they will be out of business soon. They don’t even pick up the phone.< /review>< pics>

<text>I received a message the product was shipped and call if I had any questions. When I got thru to the Customer Service, I was told by an overly 'happy person' that is was shipped and the cost. She then added that it would go down after a couple of months. In this day and time money it tight and nothing should be shipped without the customer begin told how much something is first. Do not leave a message with no information on cost or confirming mailing address and hope that it is what they requested. I had to call back three times to get the shipment stopped, only to be told it was shipped and there was nothing they could do. I had to have my Doctor also cancel it on his side as a backup. No good business practice and I will never do business with your company if I can help it.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2f594d4e477b:0xcc351e3ebd81035b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It seems like the different departments don't communicate their emails are always down and they've given me six different fax lines none of which work. I spent way too much time and effort trying to place an order with them that they just can't seem to get processed. I have no idea how this company is still in business. Good luck to anybody trying to get through to them would highly recommend just paying cash or using a different business for your medical supplies.< /review>< Date>

<text>I was a agency (Randstad) employee at Byram for 2 months and in that short time I witnessed plenty of favoritism by leads and floor managers who constantly flirt with any pretty female that the agencies send them. You must pull so many orders a day to stay with the company and the females everyday recieved easier orders then the male pickers. I complained about it and had the leads got upset and call Randstad then a staffing manager, Destiny Rivera called me to trying to scold me like I was a little kid for complaing about the situation. I was told by her to not come back to Byram then Destiny Rivera and her other recruiting agents fell silent to helping in finding other employment for me. I figured out quickly that Byram is in contract with Randstad and my complaints are not good for Randstad more then they are for Byram. So the problems will always exist at Byram. Very bad place to work for, unless your a pretty female then its a perfect job to have.

Couldn't be more satisfied with their service. It's the easiest part of my job calling for the reorder because of the good people at Byram that's why they're solid from coast to coast.< /Text>< Resp>

<Review>Byram Healthcare provides an important and valuable service, but they need to increase their customer service efforts to keep up with such high demand. Perhaps hiring some more service members to handle the high call volumes can help improve this long and often upsetting interaction between the company and its customers.

*UPDATE*

I am extremely disappointed to say that Byram has lost my faith in their services. They continue to incorrectly bill me, and their inability to provide customer service has left me with nothing but frustration. Their website does not display the correct information and the entire process of ordering online would be laughable if not for how broken it is. -5/5 stars</Review>< Pictures>

The WORST company! Hands down, the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Billing is a MESS, and they improperly charge you for items you never even ordered, then they hold your account hostage until you pay, even when you never ordered the supplies they are charging you for. Their checks and balances system is off balance. Run!!!!</Review>

It takes hours and then I get disconnected and I have to go through the whole wait for hours. I don't know how this is going to work going forward to get my supplies.

My child has been left without supplies and formula 2 months in a row despite several calls to the company assuring me her supplies will arrive on time.  I have placed orders 2 weeks in advance and have not received her order.  I have been unable to speak to a supervisor as they are gone for the day or not available.  When my supplies finally arrive, many of the cans are smashed and damaged.  I have been forced to use those cans as I have nothing else left and her formula is not available in any public stores.  The last can we opened was rotten and gelled.  At this writing I am still awaiting an order that was place originally on 6/13/13.  I have placed 4 additional calls and had been promised the order by last week.  I have been trying to work with this company in a polite and courteous manner but since the company has changed from A-Med to Byram Healthcare, their customer service has become unbearable.  You never get to talk to one person that knows what they are doing, they are constantly changing how things are done and none of the staff seems to be fully trained on new procedures.  If you are expecting a call back, don't hold your breathe.  This is the worst company I have ever dealt with.  My daughter can only be fed through a g-tube but I have no feeding bags and no formula to feed her.  You should be ashamed!</review>

<Review>I keep seeing a lot of bad reviews and am shocked. I've been using them for about a year for my ostomy supplies and haven't had any problems. The customer service reps have always been very nice and helpful. Shipping is extremely fast, within four business days.<//Review>< Pics>

Can I give 1/2 star?  This company is terrible.  It is amazing they are still in business.  It is virtually impossible to get help.  We received a recent shipment of several cartons of catheters.  A few boxes in the cartons were the wrong size.  I discovered the error about 2 months after receiving the shipment.  We receive multiple boxes of product and put away the shipping cartons containing multiple boxes of catheters until needed.  When I contacted the company I was told that we had 10 days to return product otherwise we were out of luck.  I explained to them that the error had made by their shipping department.  Silence from Byram Healthcare.  I used their customer service online "chat".  After 45 minutes of useless chat from their rep, they refused to help.  They refused to tell me the location of their office.  They refused to give me the name of the supervisor.  They refused to give me the name of the local sales manager or VP of Sales.  I finally located the name of the president of the organization and attempted to call him.  Again, crickets.  Now, I understand that's overkill for a relatively small issue like this, but I was so annoyed with the lack of customer service, I was willing to move up the ladder for help.  No. Such. Luck.  I've just learned that the company has been acquired by a larger company.  Hopefully the new owner will make a clean sweep and bring in people who are willing and capable of doing their job properly.<//Text>

If I could rate them a negative one I would. My boyfriend is type one and needs his transmitter to stay informed when his sugars are critically low. Unfortunately this pharmacy failed to do their job by making him go back and forth between them and his doctors office for a prior authorization that was not needed in the first place. Therefore wasting time he doesn’t have. His contact person Phoebe was no help at all considering that once everything was resolved (no thanks to her) she had the audacity to send his supplies via ground shipping which takes 3-5 days, when he expressed this was urgent almost 3 weeks ago!  What’s the point of a contact person if the patient does all the work? How is this company still in business when their patients are not a priority? I guess patients having critically low blood sugars until the seize out and go unconscious is okay with them... If Phoebe had any real patient skills she would have expedited his supplies to ensure he would receive them sooner considering this was urgent from day one!</text>

For nearly 3 years I have received my medical supplies from Byram without issue.  And on the  rare occasion when I or my doctor has been negligent in ordering my supplies in a timely manner, Byram has gone above and beyond to see that I got my supplies immediately.  Always friendly and always helpful.<//Text>

<text>I am frustatingly dissapointed with this company. If i didnt need these supplies i would definitely not bother with Byram. I was approved for their product January 30th. I just received my first products May 8th. So many people dropped the ball. Case manager Allison is the worst. I left her about 8 messages and not once did she call me back. I had my Dr.s office get involvrd because my authorization was going to expire. Allison lied to the Dr.s office. Said she left several voice messages. I am dissabled and stay home all day everyday, i did not receive any message. I called customer service for the 9th time to check on my order. Only to find out that it was return and on hold at the warehouse for over a week. I was never notified. Decided to file a formal complaint on May 6th, I was told someone would call me within 24 hours. It is mow May 10 and i have yet to speak to  any upper management. So frustrated and dissapointed on their customer service and dependability. Horrible company.</text>< UserId.>

Byrum Healthcare company doesn't deserve a dime or even negative Star, they are like nightmares, my story similar to Ree Bertinot review below, and maybe even more worse, they don't deliver the supplies, and hold it for no reason, they wait too long to answer phone calls, they unreliable, they are bad bad bad, I did file a grievance against them, they make people life more risky, miserable and wasted my time.< /text>

<date>1539881435136<//date><Rate>5</Rate><text>I disagree completely with the negative reviews. I have received nothing but caring prompt service. Byram has taken care of both insurance and doctor communications . My products have arrived ontime and when I inquired about alternate solutions , samples have arrived overnight. The customer helpline does exactly that. These subjects were difficult for me to share on , however the customer service reps were professional and eased me through what could have been an embarassing order process. Thank you Byram!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Do NOT use them!  I am a new customer that started setting up my account with them in August.  It is now November and my account got set up right as a ran out of my CGM supplies.  I called several times over the last few months and made attempts to contact the person in charge of my account but he never called back.  The other people I spoke with assured me repeatedly that they would send my supplies out soon.  One or two of them even commented about how long it was taking to get my account set up.

However, with every call I made I found more mistakes with my account - wrong address, wrong order etc..  Finally, as I use my last CGM sensor, I get a hold of someone who says that they will ship my order to me within the week.  My package was 'delivered' this morning, but I found out that it was delivered to my old address on the other side of the country - after I had already told them my new address. And not only that, but they shipped the wrong thing, even after I had corrected them (multiple times!)!!!

So now I am in a situation that I try so hard to avoid - I am out of supplies, the supplies are on back order, and I have no idea when I will get what I need.  I am in the process of finding a new supplier.  My life depends on getting my CGM and other medical supplies before I run out, not after.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have a standing order the same supplies every month. How hard is it to just ship my complete order, on the same day each month? Why do I have to call ten times a month, before yall get my order half correct. Hoping a supervisor reads this review. I have never got a supervisor on the phone. Just get the it is shipping out today. Then I am lucky if one thing, out of the dozen things in my order shows up weeks later. Wish I could find a better company, that accepts my insurance. Is there a lack of supplies, or just a lack of respect for your customers? I have not once in two years got my complete order without calling multiple times. This company is ridiculous, and has no integrity. My last order contained what looked like used discolored, repackaged catheters.<//Text>< pics>

<review>LET ME ADD ON TO THIS REVIEW. TODAY IS 8/12/2015 MY LAST ORDER WAS DELIVERED 7/10/2015 ( DATE OF MY LAST REVIEW), THERE WAS 31 DAYS  LAST MONTH MAKING THIS FOLLOW UP ORDER 3 DAYS LATE AGAIN NOT INCLUDING HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE TO GET DELIVERED! WHAT A SURPRISE! I CALLED AND SPOKE TO SOME FEMALE NAME NORA, SHE ANSWERED THE PHONE WITH A BOTHERSOME TONE LIKE I INTERRUPTED HER AS SHE HAD SOMETHING ELSE MORE IMPORTANT TO DO. I ASKED WHY MY ORDER HAS NOT BEEN PROCESSED AGAIN SHE SAID THEY CALLED LAST WEEK AND COULDN'T HAVE REACHED ME. WELL I NEVER ONCE GOT A MISS CALL FROM THIS COMPANY AND YES I CHECK MY VOICEMAIL CONSTANT. THEY'LL PULL ANYTHING TO GET CUSTOMER OFF THEIR BACKS, INCLUDING HANGING UP PREMATURELY LAST TIME I SPOKE TO THEM, COULD'VE SAID SORRY FOR THE MISCOMMUNICATION OR SOMETHING BUT THE REPS RATHER FIGHT OVER THE PHONE THAN BE OF HELP TO ANYONE, WORTHLESS CUSTOMER SERVICE SCUMS. I WILL NOT BE DOING BUSINESS WITH THESE SCUMS EVER AGAIN.  I WILL BE SWITCHING SERVICE ONCE INSURANCE APPROVE ANOTHER PROVIDER.

PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY AND DO BUSINESS WITH SOME OTHER AT ALL COST. THE MOST RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME I CALLED. THE REASON I CALL IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ELDERLY PATIENT WHO TRY CALLING THEM EVERY MONTH TO RE ORDER MEDICAL SUPPLY. EVERY MONTH OUR ORDER IS TO BE PROCESSED IN 28 DAYS AND DELIVERED ON THE 30TH DAY. WE WOULD NEVER RECEIVED THE ORDER UNTIL PASS THE 5TH WEEK. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REOCCURRING FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS! I WOULD CALL TO CONFIRM THE STATUS OF THE ORDER SOMEONE RUDE ON THE LINE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE REQUEST DUE TO THE ISSUE BUT INSTEAD INTERRUPT AS THE CUSTOMER IS SPEAKING TO TALK OVER THEM WITH BUT THIS BUT THAT. TODAY, I SPOKE TO SOME WOMEN WHOM I COULDN'T PRONOUNCE HER NAME OR COMPREHEND THAT I WOULD LIKE THE ORDER TO BE SHIPPED OUT TODAY (WHICH FULFILLED THE 4 WEEKS THAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED) BECAUSE THE PATIENT DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MEDICAL SUPPLY IF IT IS PLACED 7 DAYS LATER AS SHE TOLD ME THAT WAS WHAT SHE HAD IN HER SYSTEM. AS I WAS STILL TALKING TO CONFIRM THE DELIVERY DATE TO HER SHE HUNG UP THE PHONE WITHOUT SAYING THANKS FOR CALLING OR HAVE A NICE DAY OR ANYTHING REGARDING THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMPANY. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME RIGHT.  AVOID THESE JACKASSES AND DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE FOLKS. TERRIBLE SERVICE< /review></record>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! The are dishonest and out for money only. They sent an email to me saying a product was not in stock. I ended up ordering from another company. Then one week later they shipped the product to me. When I asked to return it they SAID OK YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RETURN. I spoke with their supervisor TOM who was very cold and said MAAM we deal with thousands of orders. You are not a concern to us. FIND ANOTHER COMPANY TO GIVE YOUR MONEY TOO! This one is not good.< /Text>

Just spoke with an “Arlene”.  My 2 year old son’s supply of PediaSure has been delayed for at least a couple weeks now.  My husband and I have called several times to see what the hold up is.  I advised Arlene it’s imperative that we get the PediaSure because my son relies strictly on it for food.  He feeds via g-tube.  She had the nerve to ask, Well what have you been doing all this time?  Obviously, my husband and I have been purchasing it out-of-pocket but it does add up and my son goes through quite a bit.  After my call with her, I just felt like she insinuated that I was starving my son and that I was an incapable parent.  And each time my husband and I have called, we never get the same person and so the info provided varies.  Btw, it’s an issue with insurance which I understand, but it doesn’t warrant a response like that.  Absolutely disgusted with her insensitive question.</review>

WORST COMPANY EVER!  Over the last 2 months they have shorted me 100 catheters, had a recall on those catheters (which was not their fault) that had to be replaced and they replaced them with more recalled catheters!

Now looking back over the last 10 months I can’t help but feel I have been ripped off!  Twice I ran out of catheters & had to purchase more out of pocket...however this was before I started counting upon delivery.  In the latest delivery not only were there not enough boxes to complete my order but 3 of those boxes weren’t even full.  However this isn’t terribly surprising when you learn they don’t even hand count the boxes going into the delivery box they weigh the box...what kind of quality control is that!

As a consumer shouldn’t you be able to trust your vendor isn’t shorting you?  When dealing with critical illness the last thing you need is headaches like dealing with this HORRIBLE company.< /Review>

My wife ordered a breast pump from this company. They sent us a bill even though it was paid for by our insurance. Took two months of calling, but they finally said it was their fault in a paper work error. 2 Years later and we get a bill from a collection company. This company needs to be shut down.<//text>

They seem to be very unorganized. When I need to reorder I don't know if I should wait for an email or a telephone call. When I get a bill about a week later I receive another but it's from the other side of the country. The billing becomes very confusing & i'm not sure if I had paid it or not. My suggestion is "get your act together"< /Review>

My daughter had authorizations for DMEs and they suspended our account without notifing me because they had not been paid by the insurance for over a years worth of claims. I don't know why I wasn't notified and why they are barely dealing with it a year later. The insurance said that they had not filed the claim properly.
Now, I'm trying to order a insulin pump for my daughter and that's how I found out they suspended our account. (Great...just great) They will not let me order the pump until they get the money for the other claims and now they are telling me it can take 45 days. They are blaming the insurance and the insurance blaming them and meanwhile my daughter is being punished for someone else dropping the ball. I have spent several hours everyday on the phone with Byrum and the insurance for this will be the 7th business day now. The supervisor told me last Friday that today they would send one box while we are waiting for the insurance  And they just told me that they have no order in the system and it will take another 24hrs for response.  WOW!!! Now I know why they have such a low rating.<//text>

This outfit sucks!  For several times now they tell me they will ship my Diabetic testing supplies on a certain date but then fail to do so.  They claim they need a new prescription every time but fail to let the patient, or the doctor, know this.  I have called and called with no results.  My test strips were scheduled to be sent out in mid April.  As of yet the order has not bee processed.  Stay as far away from this outfit as you can!!!  I wish I could have given them a negative star rating!!</Text>

Every time I have to deal with Byram to order medical supplies, I wish for the day when the entire US healthcare industry gets razed to the ground and rebuilt. Incompetent service and uncaring attitudes.</Review>

<Review>As a vendor, I've partnered with Park 12 to host events for residents. The complex is located just outside the Gaslamp hub, and feels very safe and secure with electronic keys required to enter the building. The grounds are well manicured and the community event spaces are decorated with modern furniture and designs. Many also have incredible skyline views.

I've worked with Gabrielle to host on-site events for residents and she, as well as other Park 12 employees are always polite, professional and easy to work with. Gabrielle greets residents warmly, and accommodates each guest's unique needs. I've partnered with other luxury apartment buildings to host events and this location is my favorite!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjO0PKsEUNzqIUf-YfFNFZzXfLn2r-LNhYFiwf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbY2UWBJIZtCPmtzFLF8C9y-nYgtD7uavQqkkH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1607624334464, 'text': 'Hi Kristel Boe, thank you so much for your positive comments about Park 12 Podium!

<rate>5</rate><Text>Park 12 is a wonderful, bright and clean place to live. All the other residents I’ve encountered so far are happy and friendly.
I’ve lived in a few other “luxury” apartment complexes in San Diego, where the units are lovely, but management was a nightmare to deal with. So looking for my next home, knowing management can make or break a resident’s experience, I placed high priority on the attitude and helpfulness of the staff I encountered. My expectations were surpassed on all accounts—my leasing agent Valentino made the signing process so much easier and stayed in constant contact with me to make sure everything was on target for my move-in. I couldn’t imagine a more seamless move-in day: the leasing office staff that day helped me an hour earlier than opening so that I could make my appointment with the BigBox storage company. Using the loading dock conveniently located next to a reserved elevator just for move-ins shows that Park 12 thought of everything for their residents. Common areas are always clean. The security guards that I always see walk around are super friendly and make me feel safe in the building. The surrounding area is lovely with lots of shops and restaurants, and right next to a trolley stop. Thanks Park12, I am so happy here!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1613065326146, 'text': "Ashley - thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at our community and with Valentino.

Have lived at Park 12 since Jan 2019.  Love the building and the staff is great.  Very professional and helpful.  Johnny in Engineering really helped me out recently with an issue with my dryer.  The issue had been happening for quite some time as it was hard to diagnose.  Johnny went the extra mile to figure it out and we were able to get it resolved.  So nice to have it working properly.  Would really recommend this building to anyone wanting to live in a great downtown environment with great views and really cool amenities.

Super cool mixology Zoom call tonight that Gabrielle arranged.  P12 has gone a great job of setting up events for residents to participate in during Covid.  Nicolas from Angels Envy gave a really fun and informative presentation.  Was really nice to attend.  :)</text>

The apartment itself is lovely! The amenities are amazing and the staff is extremely nice. However we had a hard time with the move in process. We didn’t receive a move in letter until 2 days before move in, even though we should have received it 2 weeks earlier when we signed the lease. Didn’t get mail keys at first and when we did, they didn’t tell us our box number. Also after sending our renters insurance proof via email, we were still charged extra for renters insurance. All of this was fixable, but it was really inconvenient for us to have to continue to bug the staff about this. We love this apartment and love being here, but the move in process was rough.<//text>

Original post written November 2018

An awesome place to call home!

We've been here about 2 months, and so far I have found nothing negative about this place. The views of Petco Park, Point Loma and the Pacific Ocean from our higher floor are absolutely stunning.

The appliances are brand new and top-notch, and the geek in me just loves the fact that I was able to choose which fiber internet provider I wanted - AT&T or Cox. Both offer full gig speeds up and down here at the building. Throw in the eight CAT6 network drops that are located throughout the apartment and you have a home network that is pretty much the envy of any tech person - which is who they are probably targeting.

The central A/C works great. The floor to ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom are very nice. There’s nothing quite like waking up and looking at Petco Park or watching a Navy ship return to port.

Parking is provided via the gated underground garage.  First space is free, unlike other downtown apartments that charge over $100 per month for your first parking spot. Parking spaces are wide, which is probably a good thing, as there are a lot of high end cars in the garage.  The proximity of the Gaslamp Quarter is just icing on the cake.

I almost forgot to mention the staff.  They are wonderful.

What's not to love :)

UPDATE - 11 May

I still give this place 5 stars. All of the amenities are now up and running. No issues with the homeless like some other reviewers have stated. Area around Park 12 is MUCH better than the rest of East Village - It’s all part of living downtown.

I will definitely renew my lease :)</text>

I am a new resident to Park 12 and I was very hesitant with becoming a renter again after being a homeowner for over 12 years.  But, I was seeking a change in scenery and very much so wanted to experience living in Downtown San Diego again with my son.  I am a native San Diegan and I had toured several apartment buildings over several weeks and finally came across Park 12.  Being that we are currently in the midst of a pandemic my expectations were high as it relates to safety and customer service.  First impressions are extremely important to me and I was throughly impressed with the Leasing Office when I was greeted by Valentino Ward.  Of course he made sure we were masked and provided us with hand sanitizer to ensure our safety as we toured.  He was so personable, kind, and an attentive listener because I had a mental picture of exactly what I wanted my apartment to look like.  He was very patient with me as it took a few tries to find the perfect spot for my son and I.  I can say without any reservations that he helped me find exactly what I was looking for!  His level of customer service is exemplary and he evens takes the time to check in with us periodically to see how we are doing.  I am a very happy tenant at Park 12 and would recommend taking a tour if you are interested in experiencing what Downtown San Diego has to offer.< /Text>

Worst experience of my life.

I reached out to park 12 asking for a certain type of apartment and they showed something to my satisfaction, i told them that i only visit here in America for school and I don’t have all the documents needed according to their website and the sales people told me they will check what they can do, a day after i got a call and they said if i provide a certain document i will be approved, i paid $550 for screening and applications fee and everything looked fine.
After waiting about 3 weeks, sleeping in hotels and waiting for my new apartment they called and said that there was a mistake and the corporate won’t approve my application without all the documents.
I was frustrated because i couldn’t provide those and i said it from the beginning, now i had to lose $50 for the cost of screening or what ever and i was fine with that. The remaining $500 should be sent to me through mail and guess what, it’s been 30 days and I haven’t received anything back. When i call they say it can take up to 90 days, when i ask for tracking number there is none, i offered to pay from my own pocket for over night shipping or a shipping with a tracking number and they won’t even allow me that giving me a ridiculous excuses.

That’s unbelievable and frustrating how a company which is that big act.</review>

I don’t even live here, I’m in the process of applying. But I can already tell it’ll be an enjoyable experience! I’ve asked the gentleman Robert a million questions already and he’s answered them very politely and promptly! The building is sparkling clean and the garages are spacious! So far so good! 👍

Update: June 2nd, 2020. I’ve moved in a month ago and it’s still a 5 star! Every single question I’ve had they answered and helped me a ton! Best place I’ve ever lived in so far!</Review>

When it comes to management, expect no helpful assistance or even kindness. Gabrielle is the most rude and disrespectful member of a management team.
Residents constantly complain and move out solely for this reason.
Have an issue? Don’t expect Gabrielle or the management team to lift a finger.
Interesting to see 5star reviews immediately after 1star reviews.</Text>

<review>Management is disrespectful and discriminates against individuals. Gabrielle is a manager but really lacks professionalism and appears to constantly be unhappy, which makes communicating with her a horrendous task. Many neighbors have left Park 12 because of the terrible relations management has with residents.

<text>I loved living there.  I relocated from Chicago and moved in a year ago.   I had to move again for work related reasons but was sad to leave.

My first day I had a problem with my movers and was both stressed and in a very bad mood.  I was not very nice to Gabrielle.    Not only did she  remain calm and professional, but she also calmed me down.  The rest of my move and year went great!

I also loved  the events that Gabrielle organized.  I was able to attend many both pre Covid and during the Covid restrictions.  I  appreciate  that they were able to do virtual  events and socially distanced events.  During a crazy time and being new to San Diego,  it gave  me a real sense of community and the ability to meet  neighbors.

I will miss the location of the property.  Even without live baseball, I loved being so close to Petco.
The building and neighborhood  has a great vibe.  I am going to miss it.  Hopefully,  I will be able to return.  I highly recommend  the building!
Thank you Gabrielle  and the Team for a great year in San Diego!!!<//text></record>

This place is so awesome.  Perfect location, down by the water and across from the ballpark.  The views from my apartment/bedroom are breathtaking.  My apartment was so intelligently planned, with tons of storage space and plenty of living space.  And the amenities are top notch.  This is the kind of place that has chilled water bottles in the gym and a little welcome bottle of champagne when you move-in.  They are still building up some of the amenities, and some of the other reviews you will read are written by people that can't handle that.  But, trust me, this place is a 10/10.< /Text>

Would not recommend. It was a huge waste of money for me to live in this building The details in the building are not taken care of... Dirty elevators trash in the hallway that stays for 7 days or more... I've watched out of curiosity how long it would take the building maintenance to notice it. Over priced. And the true address for this building (and entrance into the parking garages is from Imperial avenue) is on Imperial Avenue. This is the end of East Village where there's tons of homeless near the trolley and bus station and St Vincent de Paul.
It was a huge waste of money And there's so many comparable high rise properties nearby for $700 less per month. Research and find one with a lower price point. Or if I was going to pay this amount of money I should have moved to Little Italy.</Text>

I hope this review will help anyone who is thinking of renting here. I was an employee of Park 12 who has been here since the property opened and worked here until a few weeks ago. I was not fired and I am not a disgruntled employee. I am giving an honest unbiased review so I hope you take this for what it's worth.
The property itself is beautiful and I loved the residents here so much.  Unfortunately, over the last few months, the management team that is in place here has run Park 12 into the ground. They have absolutely no idea what they are doing and it is definitely starting to show. The leasing agents who are there do the best they can with minimal support from management. When the City building opened, management moved over there in an effort to completely wall themselves off from residents and staff. Any emails to management from staff members or residents go unanswered and if they do decide to respond they will only address what they feel like. Residents and staff are rarely told the truth (examples: parking: there is NO guest parking and information on amenities changes all the time).
I've been in this industry for almost 30 years and I've never seen a management team behave is such an unprofessional way. The biggest problem at Park 12 is the Leasing Manager . Rude and unprofessional and lacking any customer service skills, you can see why there are numerous negative reviews just about her on this very website. I'm shocked at how paying residents and their guests are treated and it's just disgraceful.
Management will lie to your face just to avoid telling you the truth. The amenities are nice but are not controlled or kept impeccably clean.The game room is a disaster with things always broken, and the pet park is a smelly disgusting mess.
Do yourself a favor and look at another property if you want to reside in the East Village. There are so many other options out there where you will be appreciated and respected. For the rents they are charging, it's not worth it, so I would suggest you look elsewhere. The residents and staff here at Park 12 DESERVE a better management team then what is in place here right now. It's a shame, because the property is nice, but when you have such an insufferable and incompetent management team, it makes living here as a resident a huge challenge. I hope this review helps you!</Text>

Living here has not been an enjoyable experience - I'm looking forward to my lease ending. I have been renting apartments for 15 years and I've never had an experience like this. If you are looking at a place to live at Park 12, I hope my review helps you ask the right questions so that you do not end up in my situation.

The only good thing about this place are the amenities, but even those (like the movie room and game room) always have issues. The staff (except for Kisa-she's awesome) is horrible at customer service and proper communication. For example: No one notified us ahead of time that Lyric was moving into the floor above us and re-doing those units to rent out as a hotel service. Because the Harbor and City buildings are made of sticks, it was incredibly loud and disruptive and vibrated our entire unit for weeks. Furthermore, now that the unit above us is a hotel service, there are people that are in and out and not aware of how their noises are affecting the people below them. Another example: The property insists on playing loud music in the courtyard and I have 2 speakers in front of my balcony - working from home is tough. I feel like I can't get peace and quiet in my own home and I have to always have the tv on to drown out the sounds. I have complained multiple times and Kisa was the only one who was helpful, but the music came back (with a vengeance) and remained on last night and played ALL NIGHT. WHY?! I try calling Greystar to discuss my issues and it is impossible to get anyone on the phone - the recording sends you to an "operator" that just is a voicemail and no one returns your call.< /review>

***Customer Service at its finest...Thank you Mei-Lee***

As a military member I lived and visited countless places around the world. READ THIS CAREFULLY... I have never experienced the level of customer service provided by the leasing professional Ms. Mei-Lee Raya. She truly went above and beyond to ensure that was able to experience all that Park 12 had to offer unlike none other. She took descriptive videos, measurements, late phone calls and much more to ensure that I was making the most educated and informed decision, as I was attempting to lease a unit from 3,000 miles away. These words do not do her enough justice or appreciation. She has made this moving experience flawless and I love the new community that I am apart of. This will only improve exponentially once all the amenities are finished. The location is perfect. She along with the Park 12community  have my strongest recommendation of where you should live in you are in the renting market. Spend your money here I promise that you will not regret it.< /Text>

<Text>Future Tenants BEWARE. There is a 3 million dollar renovation currently underway at Park 12. The building is only 2 years old and already a water main pipe burst on the 30th floor. All elevators were closed for 2 days and continue to have issues since. This forced me to climb up and down over 25 flights of stairs multiple times a day. What about the residents with physical disabilities? My parents were one of those people being trapped in my own apartment forced to spend the night without medication.

It has been over 2 weeks now and you have constant construction going on in the hallways. There is water damage on practically every floor. Moving crews and contractors pack the rarely available elevators with their equipment. You have to wait a life time just to be packed in like sardines.

I don't blame onsite management but at the corporate level they are dropping the ball. No type of compensation is being offered. I have other tenants passing out law firm business cards for people that want someone to help them break their lease.

For how much I pay to live here it's not worth this headache. I would expect this from Pinnacle but not Park 12. That's saying something.

They will not tell you about many details you will end up paying for. Plus, they don’t follow the contract, but expect you to follow it! The manger over there is not doing her job properly and blames her mistakes on others. They don’t mind being rude and accusing you of lying just for a couple of hundred dollars.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I got a tour of this place last Sunday. Perhaps, I had much higher expectations but this is just a normal place with below average service and maintenance. Aside from a very poor showing experience by the sales person, there were some very noticeable issues with the place. The price is too high compared to what the place is. I noticed dog poop in non-pet areas during the tour. There was also ashes of burnt things in some corners of the building. We visited several floors and there was a very strong smell of garbage on every floor which was confirmed by the tour person as well. The place is too far from any of the highways with less of a 5 exception. Obviously, Park 12 is right next to Petco Park, so there will be a delay getting in and out of the building with a car. And they seem to be very disorganized with their appointments too. Some of the apartments we were toured were poorly laid out with a lot of wasted space. Some views of apartments were spectacular. They do have pools, a gym and a business center but that's nearly any building in downtown now; nothing special about that. Overall, it is really hard to justify paying that high of a price for such poorly maintained place.< /text>< pictures>

<rate>1</rate><review>Just giving my honest opinion, I hope no one rents from this place. It is very beautiful and has great amenities, but that is about it, for the size and extra cost of small things you pay for and if you want to park your vehicle in a certain area, as well as them not having professional consistent staff, I would not suggest anyone to live here. I do not live here myself but I am frequently about 3 times a week with a client and all i hear is bad things as well as witness things and unprofessional behavior from previous staff. And that also goes for security they have as well, I have seen several guys who seem to not care about there job, and also and older guy who just seems very creepy and he barley ever specks. Also for the holidays they sent out an email saying the residence cant even have a wreath on the door and door mat and also had a time frame of like the first week on January to have there Christmas trees and decor removed. No one pays for your living space but you and for them to say the owners or whoever had a complaint about certain things that is not fair for the tenants because they are the ones living here and shouldn't be told what they can and can not do with there space, as long as things arent being damaged. Also the homeless people who sleep right across the street are a huge problem and cause quit a distraction and does not make it comfortable to even walk around outside sometimes and         very disturbing to some. But overall looks dont make a property and this place will not make you feel at home and after visiting so often I wouldnt want   possible tenants to be unhappy.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The worst apartment and management. We moved in back in 2018 and amenities were promised but were extremely late on opening. And by late, I mean months late. Management is slow to respond to emails and phone calls. They are a complete joke when it comes to moving out. We are moving halfway across the country and they would not allow our UPack ReloCube to sit in the loading/unloading dock for the weekend for us to move out, even though I emailed them regarding this weeks before the move. They suggested we use a UHaul and move our things into that and then pack it into our cube at a different location.
Definitely will not live in this building again. The views are nice but not worth the $3000/month price tag for a 1bd 1 bath.<//text>

I was super excited to move in but I couldn't be more disappointed. The building has been open for 6 months now, and the only ammenaties that they've managed to open are the dog park and the gym (which is pretty basic, yet still took them 5 months after opening to complete). If you're really thinking about moving here, you should sign a 12 month lease somewhere else, and when that lease is up they might actually have something else open. The only construction that seems to be making any real progress are the other units that they want to open in order to collect more rent. Don't be fooled when they try to tell you that all the ammenaties will be open soon because they've been telling that same lie to everyone, and every month they have some new excuse as to why nothing is done yet.< /text>

There are professional grade grills throughout the property for outdoor gatherings with friends and family. A state-of-the-art business center with reliable WIFI, study rooms, and a conference room. To say I am euphoric with my new apartment is an understatement; many thanks to the staff and Greystar for your allegiance to excellence and quality.

<text>STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PROPERTY! SCAM ALERT! Where do I even begin. I moved into Park 12 in October of 2017, I was lured in by their 1 month of free rent, and the fact the building was almost new with no one living in it. As a business owner in downtown and in La Jolla, I wanted something near my business downtown. The building is located in downtown but is right near a large unsafe and unclean homeless district. When I moved in I was promised by the leasing agents and management that the amenities would be ready by end of November. One of the most important amenities being the gym. Since the gym wasn't ready, and factoring in my rent was as high as it was quoted was due to the building offering such nice amenities, I had expected the gym be ready to avoid having to pay for a near by membership. The Gym just recently opened, and after 4 months of paying close to $85/ month for a gym nearby.

IT GETS WORSE!
When I moved in, I talked to leasing about my concerns of being a young woman living downtown alone, and how I needed to have 2 access fobs. I needed one for my dog walker, emergency (given I have some health concerns). They told me they would not issue me any sort of fob after me asking for it several times. They did PROMISE that if I ever needed anyone to come in or there was an emergency that there was 24/7 access into the building and into my unit by security. This was a BIG FAT LIE!

Just about a month ago, when I was coming home after a birthday party, I had my small wallet stolen when I was out, came home and asked for security to let me up to my home. They advised me they couldn't let me into my unit and that they did not have a master key to the units. After 6 hours of waiting in the lobby, and having to sleep in the lobby, a maintenance guy who apparently lived in the building came down and let us up at 6am in the morning. After calling the police, management and working with security all night trying to get to my sick dog (who suffers from separation anxiety) and to be able to sleep in the home I pay a premium for, no one had the key! I had lost sleep and a day of work costing me 1000's of dollars, and a trip to the doctor from a small seizure I had suffered from stress and embarrassment from other residents seeing me laying down in the lobby! Talk about mortifying! Especially after I had asked them to issue me another emergency fob for me to leave in my business or vehicle.

It GETS worse! Even after this incident and emailing management not once penny of severance was offered! They did give me another fob, which they referred to as a "limited access" fob. Shortly after, I had my assistant bring a rent check in February, the building claims they can't locate the check, and threatens me with legal fees because the check being late caused my rent to be delayed.

This Place is a mess! It needs new management. The manager Jessica has no clue what she is doing and has no business as a manager at this high rise. She has treated me with disrespect and did not reach out to me when I was locked out from my house, not even so much as to apologize.

The principal here is DO NOT waste your money giving it to this building. You will be very unhappy and feel like you are a walking $ sign than a valued resident.

On the lighter side, Eric and Mei - Lee are very nice, and would make great management.<//text></record></dataset><record>

If you want to pay top dollar for a luxury experience and be treated as a second class citizen then look no further than PARK 12. I have been a resident here since they opened, there were no amenities until very recently but I knew that going in. In the 10 months I’ve lived here I have been traveling for 3 of those months and I actually had to break my lease because of a career move, I bought myself out of the contract and paid all the fees no questions asked, after all I did sign a contract. I had had some not so nice encounters with the leasing manager Amanda Penir but I have been too busy to care enough to write a review, however this weekend was the last straw. I never used the amenities I pay top dollar to have, so I invited some of my friends to the game room to say my goodbyes, Amanda was on duty that day and she sent the security guard to kick my friends and I out of the game room, we were only eating and talking, a group of 8 people including me. When I went to speak to her she said I would have to rent a space if I wanted to have more than 2 guests in the common areas and that I could rent one of the clubhouses for $150 an hour. I had no idea this was the case, I’ve lived in other high end luxury buildings and never have I had issues as long as you are respectful and clean after yourself. I offered to pay the $150 to which she responded “well, do you a check on you?” No, Amanda I don’t walk around with blank checks on my back pocket. I asked to stay in the game room and pay the $150, I had ordered some food and we were already set up, she said no, that I had to move my things or “you can take your friends to your apartment”, thanks Amanda! I didn’t know I had the option of using my apartment. I was so embarrassed I had to ask my friends to leave and on top of it all Amanda sent the security guard to hover around us while we cleaned up, I felt like a criminal, I wasn’t doing anything wrong, I was using the amenities I pay for and never get to use. Amanda’s demeanor and attitude leaves a lot to be desired, she was rude to my guests, she was rude to me and I believe she is in the wrong business. When you are in the hospitality/customer service you have to be pleasant, you have to be nice, no matter what. She could have been more understanding and offered me options, there are always exceptions to the rules, I have been in customer service for 18 years, 8 of those I have been in management positions serving to high end luxury clients. I have lived in other luxury buildings in San Diego and New York City and never have I ever been treated like I was treated by Amanda. On another instance I was having trouble with the media room, I couldn’t connect my laptop to the TV. I went to the front to ask for help, Amanda didn’t even get up from her office, she looked at me and said “just press the button on the wall” I know that if anyone else would have been there instead of her they would have walked me to the room and helped me. That same day I asked her about the wifi because apparently COX bough the lines and you can only have wifi in the common areas with your account. I was never told this when I moved so I moved my ATT&T service with me, I asked if I could get temporary access to the building wifi so I could watch GOT in the media room and she said “you can watch it in your apartment” , again, thanks Amanda! I had no idea I could watch TV in my very own home. I am beyond done with this place and so happy to be moving out. I am filing a formal complaint and already got in touch with the corporate offices in Charleston, South Carolina.< /text>

So over priced!!!! The location is in a bad area where the trolley and busses drop off bums.. I've done a tour and none of the apartments have windows unless you have a patio.... which you need to run your AC for air!? Huh.... this is SD the weather is perfect. No need to run my electric bill when it's nice outside 80% of the year...

Look at all the fake reviewers on yelp that have 0 reviews and 0 friends on yelp that are new.... FAKE!!! Beware!!!!! They reported my comment to try to take it down since they know they are putting up the fake reviews.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Apartments are beautiful. But for luxury apartments the customer service sure is lacking. It took 4 tries in order to finally contact a leasing agent. And the leasing agent was a gentleman that was very uninformative and a little rude. Also, I know its not his fault however I find it odd I can't receive any pricing information unless I go into the office. I've worked in property management and have never heard of anything like that. I just feel like a building such as this should have better service and not have someone on the phone that sounds miserable being there.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I love this massage place. The receptionist is super friendly, the place is clean and welcoming. The masseuses I have gotten are always excellent and check to make sure they are using the right amount of pressure you want. Try to tip in cash if you can. They keep the prices low so you can.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dd4b020a64844b:0x671c8f586333e780< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This would be my first negative review on Google especially for an establishment that I had an amazing experience at months ago, in which Kason massage techniques were amazing. I dont think I've ever a bad experience anywhere as I did tonight. Because there are good people working here I will stick to facts refraining from the embarrassment and disappointment.

This time around I decided to use a Groupon.
I called to appoint w/ Kason using my Groupon yesterday but was told I'd have to come in today because he was booked. Today I endured over 1 1/2 hours of traffic to get there to find out he wasnt available. I was told by a woman I havent seen around that they didnt know when he'll be back then it changed to he's not coming back to you can't select who you want if you purchased with a Groupon. No courtesy call was made b4 I made the long trek down the 405. Around 6:50p I was offered a female masseuse who I declined due to the amount of pressure I truly needed for my appointment. I was then offered an 830p appointment with another male; however, I couldn't wait around for nearly 2 hours. I called Groupon to get a refund who apologized and reimbursed me for my gas as well.

NEED TO KNOW: 1)I suggest confirming your masseuse is there before driving there. 2)if you appoint with a specific masseuse from reading reviews dont expect that person to be available for your scheduled appointment 3)the staff is usually kind, if not  there's no manager on site to assist.

I made peace with this woman b4 I  left and wish her the absolute best.<//Review>

Love this place, the staff is very nice and friendly. I went in for a massage and it t was great. I'm also doing the weight loss program and I'm loving it. I actually saw results after the 1st treatment.  I recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

My husband and I came to town from Las Vegas and wanted to get a couples massage.  We came there.  The man that did my massage was too rough! He kept on massaging in the back of the bends of my knees. You're NOT supposed to massage there at all! I had to jump so that he would stop!!! We went over a week ago and my legs are still hurting and cramping. I'm afraid and pray that I don't have a blood clot. If it keeps up I'm going to the Hospital. Never again will I do Groupon couples massage at a NON reputable place. I'll stick with Massage Envy at home where I know that they are licensed and trained to massage properly. If you go here good luck. Also, upon leaving the massage people comes up to the front with you so, I couldn't complain in person and or really write this comment on the comment card that they have you fill out because they're standing right there.< /text>

<Text>I used to go weekly, always left CASH TIP. The last time I went I purchased a couples massage and left CASH for both therapists and someone else who worked there came out with my cash, into the lobby where there was other customers,  and said it "wasn't enough" That was the last time I will ever go there....very unprofessional!  There are hundreds of better places in the area to go!<//Text><response>None</response>< pictures>

My wife and I went here with a Groupon couples massage, mind you this is my FIRST massage ever, I've been skating for years, working out, doing heavy extracurricular activities and joined the army life. I KNOW my body needs to relax. Two masseuses came in and mine asked me, "Soft, medium or hard?" I told her "hard please."

This masseuse massaged me so damn hard, but I loved every second of it, I sighed and slightly moaned from how good it felt to get all that tension finally loosened up. Go here. They really get into your back, neck, arms and legs. They also use hot smooth rocks with oil to massage you too. It's amazing.<//Review>

A cozy place to hey a massage. It was fine, the atmosphere was calm, but the massage has got me feeling a little tender in some areas. I used the groupon discount as included an hour long massage with hot stones. It was my first time using hot stones which is probably a cause of the tenderness as well< /Review>

<review>They are amazing. They are so professional, and you will know the massage was done properly because there will be a slight bit of soreness afterwards.< /review><resp>None<//resp><date>1526359831986<//date>< user>

<pics>None<//pics><username>Tracy Gold<//username><time>1517628121955</time><Text>I called this business to inquire about their Groupon deal and they told over the phone that they will honor my groupon. They asked to come in at 7pm for a massage and bring my groupon with me. Then when I get the two ladies are standing one on the phone and the other asked to show her the group, then she said I had to pay before service so handed her the money then suddenly the one on the phone was speaking Chinese tells the other lady to return my money. She tells me they can’t give me service because their boss on the phone said it’s busy. I don’t know what was that about,but they had me driving all the way to refuse my money and not to give me service. I will never do business with these people unprofessional. Not worth it.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dd4b020a64844b:0x671c8f586333e780<//gmap_id>< user_id>

The cupcakes here were pretty good but the lemonade was amazing. The customer service was good as well. I also like that the store’s decoration was not super busy and it had more of a calm feel to it. Definitely recommend.< /text>

Kara's is one of the best cupcake places I've ever tried. They are moist, packed with amazing fillings and decadent light and airy frosting. I tried a few of their classics; coconut chocolate, meyer lemony spectacular-ness amd passion fruit. The seasonal S'mores flavor was by far the best cupcake to ever grace my lips, the frosting was a lightly toasted, fluffy marshmallow that just melted in my mouth. The cake was moist and perfect the pièce de résistance was the graham cracker crust made the whole cupcake a masterpiece. Please go here just for the S'mores you wont regret it!< /Review>

This location is closed. With no signage or indicators on website or google that that's the case. Very disappointed that my favorite cupcake shop is closed.< /Text>

<Review>We happened to be walking by and decided to try some of their cupcakes. They had a special deal of 6 mini cupcakes for 15 dollars. The cupcakes were delicious and flavors were unique ( My favorite was the Meyer Lemon) however price was a little bit on the high side. Would I spend that much again? Not sure.</Review>< gmap_id>

I got two cupcakes and both were very dry, the flavor was horrible and there were large pieces of sea salt that completely ruined the chocolate cupcake. They are way too expensive for what they are. Safeway's bakery has them beat.<//text>

I went here with my mom and purchased two passion fruit cupcakes. I ate mine later and as soon as I bit into it I noticed something was off. The frosting had ABSOLUTELY no flavor. Not sweet, not vanilla tasting, not really anything. I tried it by itself and I realized it was pretty much just butter, and not even like buttercream. I asked my mom to try it because I thought I was crazy but she agreed, and we're pretty annoyed that we spent $7 for two cupcakes and got butter as frosting. It must have been a mistake, maybe someone measured the recipe wrong. Besides that, the cake part and the passion fruit filling were good.</Review>

My vanilla chocolate muffin was super hard and tasted terrible. It tasted like a dried out muffin with icing. The icing was decent yet hard too. I'm very disappointed and will not be returning.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I bought several varieties, all of which were delicious.
My only problem with the place is the very high unit price ($ 3.5).

<Text>We absolutely love this small park!
In the summer they dam the creek and it makes a small swimming hole. The playground has been completely redone and it is awesome!!
They have these zip-line like swings that my kids absolutely love!! The slide is awesome!! It's a beautiful spot for a picnic too when there are not to many people there.</Text><username>Ahsheena Santos< /username>< Time>

Great location. Far enough inland to get decent heat, but not tripe digits and close enough to town to pick up supplies if you forgot/ran out of something. Also has the added perk of being far away from tweaker activity</Text>

New play structure, swimming, campsites, day-use, bbqs, and a very nice public restroom all nestled in the redwoods just inland enough to be sunny and warm on summer days. Very family friendly, life jackets available for swimming children.</text>

Peaceful park with playground, BBQ, picnic benches, event area, and swimming during summer. Water is always cold so NEVER has blue-green algae.</review>

<Text>Rena went over and out of her way to help us in any way that she could to make the experience as easy and trouble-free as possible.

When customer service seems to be a thing of the past these days, Rena was kind, gracious and efficient. As time was of the essence because as I arrived at the Extra Space Storage facility  nearing closing time, she made sure we were able to complete the paperwork and get the signatures signed and sealed! Rena is an Outstanding customer rep. who knows her product and knows how to provide options to the customer. A no nonsense business employee.
A big shout out to Rena.

Rena truly needs recognition and praise!< /Text>< Pics>

Extremely kind, thorough, clean and easy experience.  Once booked online  I received a call within 5 minutes to follow up on my reservation. Never had a company call to check on me so quickly, it was on regards to check if I was okay with the second floor no elevator(even though it stated this on the form but easily missed when in a rush) this was great customer service.
Place is very clean and easily accessible.<//review>

<review>Oliver explained the process over the phone along with fees before coming in. We came in, had a great tour. He gave us different options and let us see them. He showed us each vital part of the storage area, such as the lift, stairs, easy access, etc. Ge walked us through the proceed with confidence and ease. They also take COVID precautions here very seriously! It smells so good in their office, keep distance and sanitize everything in front of you before you touch it. We are very happy with our rental. I feel all our items will be safe. Make sure to check the rates online!!!! So much cheaper!!< /review>< Pictures>

This is the most amazing storage facility.  Everyone who works there, like Elisa and Julian , go beyond in customer satisfaction, than any other company.  They have been so helpful and wonderful !!! They politely call me to let me know if I might be late, and they were very patient and empathetic to my situation when I was ill.  They actually cared.  The facility is also extremely secure and exceptionally clean .<//Review>

<Review>Alex is a great employee, my experience here was amazing...especially breaking down the information about the different storages and also how size matters.

I felt dumb going into this, but Alex made me feel comfortable on my decision.....a true example of customer service.

I will recommend him and this location to all my family and friends.< /Review><Time>1609363346182</Time>< user_name>

< Review>
Today I rented a storage space from Extra Storage in Alameda and found the place nice and clean compared to other storage companies I visited. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Both the gentleman (sorry I forgot his name) and Tasha were very professional and  quickly identified what size I would need.  Everything was seamless except when I decided to rent a smaller unit, after all the paperwork had been completed. I thought what a complete hassle this would be for Tasha, however she didn’t bat an eyelash and quickly made the change.  She gave me an even better unit than the original.  I strongly recommend using this location.</Review>

The term refreshing does not begin to describe my experience with this store. I have worked the customer service industry for years and lived by a code I so rarely encounter nowadays. Treat others with kindness, honesty, and respect. This is my way. In these last few years dealing with people while I'm out and about, so few have taken that to heart better than Mr. Alex Carrel.

What was supposed to be a simple inquiry of the site and its pricing turned into a worth while exchange that both answered the questions I asked and even some that I had no idea I should have even mentioned. I visited other sites of Extra Space before and only a handful even come close to the warm and friendly atmosphere offered by this one.

Mr. Carrel has proved quite patient and understanding when dealing with others and even the manager proved to be quite a treat to deal with. I take the time to write and recommend so few places to others online, but this one is an exception. If you are expecting a run of the mill box checking slog I'll tell you now you wont find it here. However, if your looking for a generally helpful staff with reasonable pricing, I can not offer more praise than this store.<//text>

<Date>1608590587958</Date><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I thought that it was great and convenient you can sign up online and receive the code immediately after registering and completing renting online, bc I wanted to start my move off hours.. however, I did it on a Sunday afternoon and didn’t start transporting my stuff until the evening after office closed. My gate code didn’t work and I tried calling the emergency line to get an access code in case my personal didn’t work, but still it wouldn’t allow me in. I realized this Monday morning after I got my signed contract back.... I guess u have to wait for the company signature back on the contract before gate access code works. So it was justinconvenient and a waste of time and energy going Sunday evening. However, front desk staff was extremely helpful with the elevator when it was jammed as well as helping me with my lock the next day. Overall good customer service and I wasnt as mad that day actually moved my first load of storage. Just don’t register online on a Sunday evening thinking you’ll be able to access your storage unit even though you’ve received access code in email and 10pm is the storage hours- unless they’ve signed and returned your contract back.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I'm not a customer...yet but I'm a truck driver and I drive all over the place. So I always notice extra space storage.  I think it's the colors that scream at you. The green letters really stand out. So just wanted to say if i ever i ever need a storage this place will be the first place I call.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1589825872265, 'text': 'We know you have many options for storing your belongings and are committed to being the most convenient, secure, and professional storage solution in your neighborhood.

Thank you, Extra Space Alameda! I've been with them for awhile and can safely say the current crew is by far the best ever. I recently decided to move to a larger unit and Tasha was a fantastic guide through a process that can become overwhelming if you let it. Well, she did not let it! She was patient, insightful, professional and found just the right unit to fit my needs. I moved without issue, and feel calm knowing Tasha and the entire team there are in charge of keeping my belongings safe. I think the new paint job on the lot looks great too-- well done! Highly recommend if you are in need of a little "extra space"!< /text>

<review>There are two major advantages to using Extra Space. The first is their people. We initially worked with Tasha (who is great btw), but everyone we've talked to there has been really nice and really helpful. They are happy to explain everything and help you with whatever you need. The second is that this is BY FAR the cleanest storage facility I've ever seen. I highly recommend Extra Space. Good people. Good facility.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We had a great experience here. The storage units were all clean and tidy. Tasha helped us find a unit that is perfect for what we need. She was very helpful, answered our questions, and made sure we knew everything we needed to know. We will definitely recommend Extra Space Storage and Tasha in the future.< /Review>

Really appreciated Magda’s help with guiding us through the process of getting our unit. She helped us figure out what would work best and all the logistics behind our lease. Everything was laid out clearly and she was more than patient and extremely helpful when we inquired about bigger units. She made sure to go over all our options and even had answers for some of our really specific questions.< /Review>

I needed a small unit very quickly and called Alameda Extra Space Storage and spoke with Tasha- she was super helpful and tried to get an idea of how much I needed to store, assuring me that she would help me get the best deal possible.  When I came in the next day, with two car loads full of things ready to store then and there, I spoke with Oliver, who was super friendly, kind and ready to help.  He determined how much space I would need and did some research into unit options to make sure I was able to get what I needed for the price I needed.  I was in and out of there in a half an hour flat- with filing paperwork and unloading my things.  Oliver was such a help and was just a super nice person to work with!  I would highly recommend Alameda Extra Space Storage!<//Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
I've never rented a storage unit before but was looking to get a relatively small one. I looked around the area and ended up deciding to check out ExtraSpace Storage. I had a change to look around and had the rates explained and felt that it was a good deal, but what really struck me was how genuinely pleasant and polite the assistant store manager was, Magda Brown, which ultimately convinced me that I didn't need to keep looking at other places.</Review>

Tasha assisted me with getting me a unit. She was super friendly and answered all my questions. The storage space is clean and has plenty of space to move through the walk ways. I decided to move my storage from SF to save over $60 and I’m glad I did!!! I took Bart and a short bus ride to get here without hassle.< /Review>

Went to get a unit and it was really fast and easy. Magda helped us understand all the pricing and get the unit we needed along with the lock needed for the unit and how to use the lock. Everything was pretty straight forward and did not run into issues.</review>

We've had our storage for over a year and recently upgraded our unit size. Oliver couldn't have made the process easier. The staff has always been on hand when we've needed them and have solved any issue quickly and painlessly. The safety of the property is a rarity in the bay area and we highly recommend Extra Space!<//text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Raised my rent on a 10x10 unit $100 in one shot with barely any notice. I'd be better off setting all my belongings on fire and buying new stuff when needed. I'm working on recycling, donating and selling everything and will be moving out as soon as I can.

EDIT: To respond to Extra Space's reply- I already did call and the local office said that "corporate" sets the rates and that they'll have "someone" call me to "talk" about it. I asked who that would be so that I could make the call to the right people and the answer was an ambiguous "someone" up the chain.

I won't change my review. This was a bait and switch. And, it turns out that Extra Space has had a class action lawsuit filed recently (Johnson et al. v. Extra Space Storage Inc.) alleging that ExtraSpace is using bait-and-switch to lure people in at lower rates and then jacking up the rent astronomically once they've spent weeks painstakingly moving everything into their storage units.

TL;DR ExtraSpace will jack up your rent 10%-50% about every 6 months. My most recent increase was 50% after not even 6 months. They are currently being sued for bait-and-switch. Do a google search for "Class Action Lawsuit Extra Space" to see what you'll be getting in to.< /review><user>105789266030026787662< /user>< Response>

Magda Brown, the assistant manager here, is a breath of fresh air.  Totally professional, cordial to a fault, very informative.  Ours was a very pleasant experience.  She helped us find the perfect storage space for our purposes and facilitated the rental process.  She’s a worthy representative of your company.< /Review>

Tasha helped me get a storage unit today, and really helped me out.  I was in need of a unit on short notice, and within an hour I was happily out the door with keys in hand.  The paperwork was easy, and everything was clearly explained.  Thank you Tasha!< /Text>

<Text>Coming into the extra space storage, Dan Tison welcomed us and it was already a great experience. He gave us all the options and recommended the best option for the best price for us. Dan did bring us to the storage space and informed us pretty well on policy and documents. Dan is super friendly and made us feel comfortable coming into extra storage space. Dan also helped us with information about when we should cancel and get our rates back from traveling. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a storage to come in and talk to Dan!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The place is very clean and safe. The staff is very nice, very friendly and very professional. Dan Tison was the person who helped me with my storage needs. Dan was very friendly and extremely professional. He took his time to show me around and explained everything in details. I was extremely pleased by his customer service. If I need a storage space again whether big or small, I will go to that location without hesitation.</review>

<Text>Cheap prices on website, yet they bait and switch over the phone when whatever unit you wanted is reserved for someone else to rent later in the day.  (It won't matter that the email states it is first come, first serve.  They do not honor that policy if they do not feel like it.  They will state they are holding it for someone else, against their policy.)

Go elsewhere to a more reputable facility.< /Text>< Resp>

Tasha responded immediately after I made a reservation, and the store has a lot of the supplies I needed to protect my stuff while in storage. Space seems very clean and well kept!<//review>

<Review>The folks here are very helpful. Although the after hours phone person gave me wrong information, once here I found the folks most accommodating. They are very pleasant and showed me a couple of units that would work for my needs.</Review>< pics>

<review>It's my first time renting out a storage unit, and Angela was very helpful and informative. She was willing to hear my concerns and answer all my questions. She was willing to show me different units, and for a better deal. Very informative and quick. I would totally recommend this place to a friend.<//review>< name>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Update: Elevator didn't work. Notified personnel at front desk. Waited 10 minutes prior making the executive decision to haul everything up the stairs (I brought the heaviest things, knowing they have an elevator). Once we were in the facility the motion lights were not working. Thank goodness for flashlights on phones because it was darker than dark. Ran into 2 staff members at the elevator one blonde female, and one black haired male. When we were leaving I asked "is there a switch for the lights up there?" They both didnt even acknowledge that I had asked them a question. They proceeded to discuss between eachother and mentioned to look at the lights but not once acknowledge that I brought it to their attention. As we were leaving  the  facility  a lady in a Blue Honda (Blonde Hair), drove me out of the gate. The gate requires a code to get in and out, this lady was what I assume on drugs because she squeezed herself through the gate and didnt enter a code. Felt very unsafe after that. Wow, never felt so much confusion in 1 visit. Updated my original review since this is now what seems to be the norm of horrible customer service.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We were initially pleased with the service here, having to close out a storage space for a deceased relative, but the difficulties I encountered while closing out our account were disappointing   We were told that if we were unable to vacate the unit by the end of our monthly rental the rent would be prorated for the month.  Well this was not so.  We paid for the next full month but when we emptied the unit we did not receive a refund.  They claimed that it is in the lease that they don't refund any of the rent but this is not what was stated on the phone.  I would recommend that you get every claim from them in writing, that was our mistake.</Text>

Outstanding service, from the first day of storing my goods 18 months ago till today, when I closed my account at this location on July 1, 2014. The staff is knowledgeable, responsive, attentive to detail and very helpful. The facility is clean, well-monitored and easily-accessible.

Without the help of the Assistant Manager I would not have been able to get out of my storage units on time. I did not expect to be given so much help, but I am surely super-thankful it was there when I needed it most.

In sum: highly recommended.</Review>

<review>Tasha gives amazing service. I came in and she showed me around and helped me a lot with getting a storage unit. She made sure I had everything I needed, even helped me set my lock. I recommend this place to everyone. If you need help looking for storage call Tasha.< /review>< Date>

After being late for mmlintment, I arrived right before her lunch brea.. No complaining, just a chipper attitude and smiles. Even when I insisted on skipping going over certain aspects of the sign up process, I was assured there was no rush and the entire process was seemless and Shanna accomadated every need and question I had.

I was very impressed with the professional reception I received.<//review>< pics>

<review>Came here today looking for the a storage, kind of an emergency out of necessity situation. The folks here are so welcoming and courteous overall just the sweetest nicest while are super professional. We were given options in sizes and driven to a building to see units. We like explained what we were looking for and Magda just knew what was the size we would need and unit she showed us was perfect. There was one thing i kind of didn’t like about it and she was cool about showing another unit which we ended up liking.

Ive never gotten a storage before so the price seemed a little high but its probably normal.

Overall you will have just the easiest nicest assistance here. And if you get help from Magda Brown she is absolutely the best.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Angela was very helpful as well as the young gentleman that works there (Jason)?  Sorry if I got the name wrong.  I needed a smaller unit and I was able to cut my bill in half and get everything into a unit just around the other side of where I was, so it was a very easy move, also there was an internet special advertised and Angela honored it once I mentioned it.<//review>

Angela Beck is an expert at getting you quickly into your new space.  She took care of the details including selling me some excellent stainless steel locks for my new space.  Site is very convenient near Park St. Bridge and local restaurants.< /Review>

Extra Space storage was able to provide me with everything I needed. Dan Tison was super helpful getting me all set up with my new storage unit. So glad I was able to find Extra Space Storage so close to my home!< /Text>

<name>Lance Rocinante< /name><date>1489255493273</date><rate>1<//rate><text>Worst customer service experience at a self storage unit I've ever had (and I've used quite a number since I served in the military).  Melissa needs to attend Customer Service 101.  She used a bait and switch maneuver (which this facility is apparently known for), and when I called her out on it, she began yelling at me.  Her colleagues were there, and when I looked at them to confirm Melissa was actually treating a grown customer this way (I actually thought I was dreaming.  Alameda businesses are generally excellent for customer service), they all lowered their heads.  Do yourself a favor, and check out any of the numerous other storage facilities on the island (which have actual alarm systems installed, too).  This place tends to always have immediate availability because their turnover is so high due to ever increasing rental rates.  You sign up for one rate, and within 2 months, guess what, you now have to pay a higher rate!  Don't believe what they tell you about keeping your rates reasonable.  Unless you get it spelled out in your contract that they won't raise rates, they will.  First and last time working with an Extra Space Storage.  I won't be back.  To anyone reading this, good luck with your move.  The Alameda business community is wonderful.  My experience with this corporate facility (which has headquarters in another state) has been an exception.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f86c1d7d0b2f1:0x2f33e1e61c623e72<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Oliver Washington was a great salesman, helpful, friendly, and very efficient.  I was in and out with my rental in 30 minutes.  A very professional organization.  I highly recommend this business.

< Review>
Worst customer service experience at a self storage unit I've ever had (and I've used quite a number since I served in the military).  Melissa needs to attend Customer Service 101.  She used a bait and switch maneuver (which this facility is apparently known for), and when I called her out on it, she began yelling at me.  Her colleagues were there, and when I looked at them to confirm Melissa was actually treating a grown customer this way (I actually thought I was dreaming.  Alameda businesses are generally excellent for customer service), they all lowered their heads.  Do yourself a favor, and check out any of the numerous other storage facilities on the island (which have actual alarm systems installed, too).  This place tends to always have immediate availability because their turnover is so high due to ever increasing rental rates.  You sign up for one rate, and within 2 months, guess what, you now have to pay a higher rate!  Don't believe what they tell you about keeping your rates reasonable.  Unless you get it spelled out in your contract that they won't raise rates, they will.  First and last time working with an Extra Space Storage.  I won't be back.  To anyone reading this, good luck with your move.  The Alameda business community is wonderful.  My experience with this corporate facility (which has headquarters in another state) has been an exception.< /Review>

I have been SO stressed about an upcoming forced move and needed to find a place to store all of my belongings for two months. My experience with Tasha Valrey at ExtraSpace Storage has totally alleviated my worse stress, I am so grateful! Tasha was able to find me the perfect space after I rattled off all the belongings I would be storing, and worked with me to get the best price possible. The process was painless, even enjoyable if you count the good company and golf cart ride. The facility is extremely clean and I feel so reassured knowing my things are safe here.<//text>

Decent storage option. They're pretty fair about rates. Bring your renter's insurance info, they require insurance and will pressure you into purchasing their option, and aren't up-front about the fact that most renters policies do cover storage units.<//text>

<Text>Had a storage unit for about a year at this location and it was very easy and pain-free. Both obtaining and terminating the lease was a very pleasant experience, due to the very helpful and friendly staff. I don't remember the name of the person who signed me up but the woman who helped me terminate the lease was named Lisa... and she was awesome!!!

Two Main Tips: (1) Set up Auto-Pay; and (2) Remember that their office is closed on Sunday.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Decent storage option. They're pretty fair about rates. Bring your renter's insurance info, they require insurance and will pressure you into purchasing their option, and aren't up-front about the fact that most renters policies do cover storage units.<//Text><user_id>116096861561030312570</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have stored my stuff here for more than 2 years and whenever I needed service, for example getting my lock cut (yes that happened) or borrowing a tool / dolly, he staff here was excellent and always helpful. Would recommended this place. Also, the hours are great. Can access my unit until 10pm every night.</Review><response>None</response>< Pics>

<review>Had a storage unit for about a year at this location and it was very easy and pain-free. Both obtaining and terminating the lease was a very pleasant experience, due to the very helpful and friendly staff. I don't remember the name of the person who signed me up but the woman who helped me terminate the lease was named Lisa... and she was awesome!!!

Two Main Tips: (1) Set up Auto-Pay; and (2) Remember that their office is closed on Sunday.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Oliver was so helpful and worked extra hard to find a unit within my price range and in the end found a unit that was not even at his facility. He was willing to put customer first instead of profits. Truly ar rarity these days. Reminds me of the Santa Claus in "Miracle on 34h Street". Got an early xmas present. Thank you, Oliver!</Review>< pics>

<date>1457141085349<//date><rating>2< /rating><text>Be prepared for significant price increases just a few months after renting here.  Month-to-month seems like a renter-friendly policy until they raise prices (and we're not talking small increases) at the worst possible time (they know you're kind of locked-in if you have a large unit, even though it's a monthly contract).  I'm accustomed to small price increases after a year, but what they do is almost unethical (although not technically illegal).  They need to be more upfront about this, especially for an Alameda-based business.

Note: I used Extra Space in another city for almost three years, and I never once had this issue, so I'm not sure if I believe the "Decisions are made by corporate headquarters, it's out of our control" line.

They could also give their facilities a facelift, and not just their front entrance and main office (which are freshly painted for their website photos).  Hallways are damp (smell like mold), dark, and narrow, and the lightweight partitions seem like they can easily be broken into.  Not good considering their location is next to a lot of vacant warehouses and old industrial buildings on a poorly lit street.  Since I'm not storing anything of value, I can deal with dated facilities.  But I never feel comfortable going here alone at dark.<//text>< Pictures>

Thank you! I am military and moving soon. They were very clean, military friendly, and proffesional. Storage space was huge! And the 1st month was free.  Marrisa did an amazing job amd was very sweet. She answered any questions i had. And they gave me a 20% discount code for truck rental.  Awsome place!!!< /Review>

Be prepared for significant price increases just a few months after renting here.  Month-to-month seems like a renter-friendly policy until they raise prices (and we're not talking small increases) at the worst possible time (they know you're kind of locked-in if you have a large unit, even though it's a monthly contract).  I'm accustomed to small price increases after a year, but what they do is almost unethical (although not technically illegal).  They need to be more upfront about this, especially for an Alameda-based business.

Note: I used Extra Space in another city for almost three years, and I never once had this issue, so I'm not sure if I believe the "Decisions are made by corporate headquarters, it's out of our control" line.

They could also give their facilities a facelift, and not just their front entrance and main office (which are freshly painted for their website photos).  Hallways are damp (smell like mold), dark, and narrow, and the lightweight partitions seem like they can easily be broken into.  Not good considering their location is next to a lot of vacant warehouses and old industrial buildings on a poorly lit street.  Since I'm not storing anything of value, I can deal with dated facilities.  But I never feel comfortable going here alone at dark.</review>

Very pleased with most the staff at this Alameda Storage place... Superb Customer Service from Noel & Jamie!

If still lived in Alameda I would rent from them. I had to come from out of State to take care of my Dad's belongings. I was working on it all for about a Week... and most of the staff went above & beyond to make things a bit easier for me.  One of the guys there (Noel) even offered to let me barrow his USB car charger for my phone!  Now w/ that & more they really went the 2nd & 3rd extra mile to accommodate me!   Thanks a bunch!!! :-]</Text>

<text>this is a great place to store your stuff . the store manager Melissa Kolb is very nice and helpful and i needed a new hasp on my unit because the one that was on it needed to be replaced she ordered a new one fast and even put on my unit to make sure it got done asap. this place is nice the staff are very cool and helpful.  UPDATE  AFTER being here 1 year and was trapped inside the gate at night with my child for being 9 minutes late i was informed by the key pad to contact the manager he was not home at the time the lady that picked up the phone told me i had the wrong number well i was lucky enough to have someone be close with a latter so i could climb the ten foot fence to get to the managers office for help well when the lady opened the door it was the same lady that told me i had  the wrong number and she instantly wanted to try to tell me the rules and that i had to call 911 if i wanted out of the gate .. my child and i where trapped  against our will she ended up peeing in her pants it was very stressful and never was even told sorry my the on site management for what we had to go thru........... i had to call the main office in utah and talk to like 4 different people..... i even contacted the fire inspector and she informed me that what they did was not safe and they need to fix the issue ........ after  waiting two weeks i was given a call by Todd  i guess the managers boss and he said they had a Glich in the system then went on to say they had brake ins and that is why it was really locking me and my child in at night ......... he even was rude and then was like ill take 50 bucks off the bill how about that will that make it all better?????
going back to when i first got a storage here i always thought it was weird that  they kind of badger you to leave a good review and name drop who helped you and how great they  where at the time i was cool with that being that the lady that was helping me was really nice and helpful and helped me with my lock hasp and never made me feel un welcomed in anyway what so ever.</text><rate>2<//rate><Time>1500727858828</Time><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The safety of my equipment was my first concern then the price of the storage and then the convenience of the location. I came to Extra Space and it was the blast. Everythings i was looking for with exceptional customer service. The price actually was less than the half of the regular price. Guys u have to come and see by ur self. Thank youuuuuu

The worst storage place ever
Angela is a racist idiot who has no respect, she forget that she is even Chinese or something, I"m decent and also professional always paid my  bill even though they always raised my rent, yet almost every time she
.saw me going in to my  space
She followed me in, stared at me as if was a suspect or doing something wrong ,she also blocked my gate access earlier than supposed to as stated on the agreement ,she didn't do this to her white masters or the many who had work shops in there, in fact she acted as if she was their dog,
The old manager Jamie was somewhat ok though but the new manager Melissa is not stupid but she is rather the queen of stupidity , she acted like a beast that was just  captured from the jungle, watch out people of color no mater how bad you need a storage space stay out of this clement ave alameda CA one.</text>
