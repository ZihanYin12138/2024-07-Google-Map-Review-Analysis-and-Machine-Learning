<review>I have gone there 4 times so far every single time they use the smallest amount of ingredients for your sandwich. I ordered a Southwest steak and cheese and they gave me 1/2 of a scoop of meat. I asked for the full amount of meat on the wrap and got charged for double meat. I am not going to ask for more of each condiment after the place a tiny amount on my sandwich. Will not be going back there, I'll drive to another location.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Last time I bought in that store, I ordered my sandwiches and when I got to pick them up they said that my order did not appear in the system but in my bank account the transaction had been carried out and the manager said that they could not give me my sandwiches or my money until my order appeared in your system? Seriously, I realized that she only cares about the money and not the costumers, she did not argue much so I had better ask my bank to make the claim, not more in that store.</Text>

<Text>We ordered three sandwiches on there app at 11:45 and our food was supposed to be ready by 12:05, we arrived to pick up our food at 12:15 and they hadn't even started making it. We ended up getting our food at 12:40. Then when we got back to work to eat we found our sandwiches were made wrong. My advice is just go in to order so you can make sure your food is prepared correctly.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Absolutely horrible! I was spoke to in profanity. I placed an order for over $67 and was told I was a liar and never paid through DoorDash. I had several forms of confirmation (credit card, email and DoorDash app.) The gentleman was extremely rude, he had zero respect for women. I have never received such horrible service in my life. I did call DoorDash and they did apologize, even though it wasn’t their fault. (Very nice) I called DoorDash because Subway refused to make my food or give me a refund. When I spoke to DoorDash they said my order was marked as delivered. On my end it was stared as processing. DoorDash said it was an error on the store.

I had to go in person to Subway in order to speak with someone because they continued to hang up when I called!!!! Please go somewhere else! We have so many other amazing restaurants/food services in American Canyon. Subway AC is NOT what our community tolerates or is about!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80850c7cb51a7ba7:0x93d0580bf7e1815e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worst service.
I place my order online and by the time I got there they told us that there was no order for me I show them that they actually charge me on my card but they still didn't do anything about it. I ask for a refund and the owner said no because there was no order for me.
There's a lot of mold by the soda machine we told one of the employees about it and they said they know about it but the owner doesn't want to do something about it.
Please don't visit this place it seems the owner cares more about the money that anything in general.< /text>

It's good sandwiches I get to choose whatever I want whatever toppings whatever sauce whatever cheese so this is one of the few places that you can go and have everything exactly the way you want it and watch them make it right in front of you you can't really ask for anything more than that so yeah whenever I need a quick meal this is a good place to go.</review>

Ordered sandwiches. Usually we go in afternoon, late, and goes well. This time just newer server I think. Wasn't usual folk. Server was a little unsure and a part of the extra avocado I ordered went into trash as server evidently unsure how to get the avocado out. Other than that, good place to go for a sandwich and usually fairly fast and facility clean</Review>

<review>Never have avocado and apparently workers can’t measure what half a sandwich is. Maybe they should start have a measuring tape if they can’t even tell the difference and they’re going to charge their customers full price for a 6inch sandwich.<//review><user>117445498787570223722</user></record>

This location is slightly better than the one by Walmart in American Canyon just down the road, but both locations are owned by the same person and neither accept corporate coupons that come out in the newspapers. We have not really eaten at either since they stopped taking coupons, not just because we can't get a bit of a deal, but because the principal of it all. If you are going to own a Subway you should follow what corporate puts out.< /Text>

Extra Space Storage has been really helpful and really convenient. It's not too far from where I live and it was reasonably priced. I appreciate the good service and friendly attitude of the staff there.<//text>

The office visit was pleasant and painless and the gentleman who handled the move-in was attentive, professional, and polite.  He communicated the terms clearly and we were able to get business handled in less than 10 min.  I don’t think there was any possible way that they could have made the process any faster, nor any easier to understand.  Great experience overall.< /Review>

<text>We had too much stuff. We couldn’t go through it to decide what to discard, what to reorganize, etc. because there was too much stuff in the way. We rented a storage unit at Extra Space and put half our stuff in it. Then we could move around again. We sorted and discarded and reorganized everything, which took longer than we planned. We did a couple dump runs, brought the important things home, and vacated the unit. The folks at Extra Space were very helpful, the unit kept our stuff safe, and there were no problems. Next time we’ll go there first.</text>< Resp>

I called Extra Space Storage to try and find a unit nearest to me, but they were all filled.  The person I spoke with referred me to one of their facilities a little farther away and gave me the manager's cell phone number.  Before I could call her, she called me!  Signing up was quick and painless and done on the phone and the manager was very helpful in explaining all the options available to me.  Overall their initial customer service was outstanding and the process of signing up was very smooth.</text>

<review>Extra Space is such a great company staffed with people who care. When the fire caused massive evacuations, we needed help and fast. Extra Space went the extra mile, getting us into a space and accommodating us site unseen. When you can rely on a local business to turn up and help displaced people, that’s a sign of a healthy community partner.</review><gmap_id>0x808e475036d3fd69:0x9ced46d8e802214c<//gmap_id><user_id>102366450047566609119<//user_id>< username>

<Name>susan moranda</Name><Text>I recently rented a storage space in Scotts Valley. The customer service has been professional and efficient as well as friendly. I brought items to store recently and it was pouring rain out and the on site manager helped me transport my items and showed me how to use the elevator as mine is on the second floor.  I thought that was really above the call of duty as he really did not have to go to the trouble.  I would recommend Extra Space Storage.</Text>< rate>

This location of Extra Space Storage in Scotts Valley is ideal in every way.  I had a complicated request, wanting to store an expensive auto.  The management, Zenda and her team are knowledgeable, thoughtful, kind and professional.  I was able to get have my storage request handled efficiently.  The room was perfectly clean, nicely located for access, and maintained like a brand new unit.  The grounds are pleasing and the location very good.  I thank Zenda and her team for the excellent service and support.<//Review>

Zenda Was extremely helpful and very kind. Me and my boyfriend were both kind of nervous going in because we’ve never rented before and she completely got rid of our anxiety by being excited to help us and sweet during the whole process. Overall great experience!<//text>

Extra Space Storage has help make my move very pleasant. I called for a space on my way from out of state and the staff helped me with a space that worked perfect for me. They plugged me into all the possible ways to save money and even treated my dog with a cookie. The manager lives on site and I have seen her make security rounds on a Sunday. Very good experience!</Text>

I also had an excellent experience with Zenda. She has amazing customer service skills and went above and beyond. I am moving from CA to TN in about 2 weeks. She sensed my anxiety and showed a space that would meet our needs AND, she even reserved it for us at a great rate in TN!  I have never used a storage space and she made it easy and one less thing to worry about!  She is very kind and extremely clean and organized.
Thanks So Much For All You Help!<//text>

The customer service is amazing. My mom actually set up the locker when I was moving from out of town and they were ready and waiting for me when I arrived with the movers. They helped estimate what size locker I needed based on how much I needed to store and got me the best deal. They have flatbed carts as well as an elevator available to help move things into and out of the units. When I pulled things out of my locker and then downsize they were very helpful and again had everything set up on the day I moved. Zenda is very on top of things and added that personal touch.
I would definitely recommend using Extra Space storage to anyone who’s nervous about storing their belongings for the first time. They walk you through everything and are very sweet.< /review>< Resp>

Zenda is very helpful and friendly and when we met her we knew this is where we wanted to be. Also sits right off the 17 making it very convenient. It’s in a gorgeous setting too, very peaceful here and quiet. Can’t think of anything we haven’t liked. Keep up the good work!</text>< user>

<text>I had an excellent experience with Zenda, the manager at the Scott’s Valley location. She was knowledgeable about the sizes and what we would need to store our ENTIRE 3000 sq ft.home!  She was patient with all of our changes and thoughtful about each detail of our move, down to the location of our units. This was such a stressful situation and she gave me peace of mind, knowing that my belongings are safe and in a secure place. I would recommend this facility to anyone that needs a safe place to store their belongings and the excellent customer service is just the cherry on top!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic customer service. We visited to collect a vehicle and unfortunately it would not start. While we waited for a service vehicle the staff hosted us for an hour, providing beverages and friendly conversation.< /review>

<date>1524588802294<//date><review>We just had to write a review for this storage place. This is the cleanest and safest storage facility we have ever used. The staff is friendly as well as professional. We stored our car, our Harley and all of my tools for about a week. This place is located right off of the highway making it extremely convenient and a fast trip back and forth. We will definitely be using them again and again throughout the year.<//review><user_name>Shane Goodwin</user_name><user>103097787019280398514< /user><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

I had a very pleasant experience with the service. It was quick and easy and the woman was very friendly, so I felt at ease with it being my first time using a storage unit. I definitely recommend it for college students but it’s pricey so split the cost with a large group.< /Text>

<Text>I drove up here because they had the large locker I was looking for. When I arrived, it turned out the driveway was too narrow to maneuver my trailer into it. Instead of brushing me off, the manager on duty called around until she found a locker at another location with enough space to back into it! She went above and to assist me, even though I did not end up renting from her location. I was very impressed. The site seems clean, many lockers are inside of a gated fence, others are outside the fence. It looks like they have lockers open to the outdoors, as well as inside of buildings.</Text>< rating>

<Review>This storage facility is awesome. I pulled my things out of this facility about a year ago thinking I could get a better deal elsewhere. Boy, was that a mistake!  This facility is the best around. The facility and units are clean and week-lit.  And the manager here, Zenda, is so nice and helpful.  She makes everything so easy!<//Review>< pictures>

I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I was surprised by Extra Space raising my rate without notice, which I obviously didn't appreciate and ultimately lead me to look for other options. However, Zenda, at the office there has been an absolute delight to work with, always friendly and courteous, and consistently going above and beyond, to ensure a great customer experience!
If it hadn't been for the corporate practices, beyond her control, I would have stored there for another year.< /text>

I have had a few storage units over the years and all have been with Extra Space. But the Scotts Valley place has been the most pleasant for me Zenda has been most helpful and so kind . There are very few people in the world that when you spend one minute talking to them that they make the rest of the day a good one. Plus the units are clean.< /Review>

<Date>1487443638412<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>We started using a Extra Space Storage for our moving materials, and went back several times to purchase more moving boxes as needed. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, giving tips and useful advice on packing strategy.

Later we found we needed to find a storage facility for some last minute things we couldn't take with us on our move. Naturally we considered all options but decided to use Extra Space Storage. Their hours of access were better than the competition and their prices were also better. The storage space was easy to access and for our needs perfectly.

These folks are great and we highly recommend them for your storage and/or moving supply needs.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

To my pleasant surprise I met Zenda who operates the one in Scotts Valley, CA. Zenda made me feel important and she treated me with the utmost professionalism and respect. Not only did I get two units but I then upgraded to the largest unit they had when it came time. I am there and I use it all because of Zenda and the way she manages that business. She is responsive on texts and phone calls and she keeps me up to date with any deliveries. Amazing service. She deserves all the props you can hand her and more. Thank you.

<Review>Excellent service, nice facility, and good space for the price. Rachel was very helpful on move-in, showing us all available units, and when we moved out she ensured we didn't overpay, getting us a partial refund for the time we were no longer using the unit. The complex was well maintained and easy to access with carts and a freight elevator to make moving in/out so much easier. Excellent facility, I would definitely rent from them again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Moving is a stressful experience. Luckily working with Rachel and Zenda at Extra Space Storage is not! I dropped in hoping that they had a storage space available that would work for us. Rachel took her time in showing me all my options, and laying out what the best deal would be. I appreciate their positive and upbeat attitudes. I would recommend anyone looking for storage to give them a try first.<//Review>

<review>You really come to appreciate this place after you start moving things in and out.  Drive up storage is a real blessing for larger storage rooms.  However, it is the late night access that really comes in handy.

We had to turn our truck in that last night and there was one last trip to storage.  We literally got there about 3 minutes before the deadline, sweating it all along the way, wondering if their time was the time on my cell phone.  Thank the moving gods it was and we were able to unload and get the truck back on time.

The office staff is super friendly and helpful and they'll work to get your business so before you rent, talk with them. You might get a deal you can't refuse for a storage locker that is fast to access because it's located on major intersection. No slogging it through city streets.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This facility is the cleanest and safest-feeling of all the storage facilities I had considered. I actually drove miles out of my way in order to store my things at this particular location. In the years I've had a rental space here, I've greatly enjoyed my interactions with the genuinely kind and attentive staff.< /review>

<review>I am new to the area and upon coming over the hill I saw that this storage facility was located just off the hwy - what great access. I had called first and then when I met the woman at the front office, she was just as informative and helpful in person as she was on the phone!  I will be back to rent because not only are these great prices but I have looked at other storage facilities in San Jose where I am moving from - and none I have seen are in comparison to this clean facility and grounds! and did I mention, the access is excellent! Thanks for making a not so pleasant move have some pleasant aspects! The storage of my stuff!<//review>< Pictures>

First this was a excellent experience for my first time ever using or renting a storage unit
The facilities were clean.
The grounds and unit felt very safe, even in the evening hours.
The manager on duty was a delight to work with.
The pricing in our area was right on point for what you are reciving.
Thank you.

The people they have managing and working here are two amazingly kind and helpful women - Zenda and Rachel! Would HIGHLY recommend this place to any of my friends! The couple of price increases in 2 yrs - not so thrilled about them, but know that it is a part of doing business and rising costs everywhere!</review>< pictures>

I've been very impressed with Extra Space Storage in Scotts Valley so far. Zenda was fabulous, very professional, and explained all the ins and outs of renting my unit and how to access it and the facility etc. extremely well.  The facility was also very clean and efficient, and seems very safe and secure.

<Date>1374627257444</Date><rate>5<//rate><text>Extra Space in Scotts Valley has been a consistently positive experience, beginning with the staff's help with picking out the best spot and the right size.  They have been very pleasant to work with and very thorough; for instance, making sure we understand the contact details particularly so there are no unnecessary hassles when we are ready to vacate our space.  More recently they helped us strategize how best to deal with our questions regarding whether to pay a full month or partial based on our, at that time, uncertain schedule – very helpful.
The facility is always clean and well maintained, as in pretty much spotless.  Lights work. Doors work. Gate works.  The rent of course, could be cheaper, but the location was so convenient for us, it has proved to be well worth the cost.
Haven’t met the manager – has't been necessary.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I love that they offer the first month for those that are just needing a short term lease, as well as the longer term pricing for those that are going to stay for a while! Another amazing detail is they also prorate if needed! Huge plus! Most storage companies unfortunately do not offer this and it is ALL ways a pain.

While my move from LA to NorCaL has not the most calming experience, my experiences with Extra Space Storage have been exceptional! It truly truly makes a difference when the person you’re engaging with is REAL, kind, considerate & friendly. It makes the already grueling task a bit more bearable! I rarely take the time to write reviews, only when I am beyond positively impressed :)

The woman who helped us Zenda, is the manager at this location and I can see why! While everyone I dealt with on the phone was kind, informed and professional, Zenda seriously went the extra mile to make sure everything was situated for us. We needed a bigger space unexpectedly, she accommodated us no problem, she was upbeat, positive throughout the mess that our move turned out to be! Truly grateful for my experiences here and will be staying a while!< /text>

Great experience here! The manager Zenda is lovely- very informative and patient. Took the time to find me a space that was a great price and would work perfectly for me. I will definitely be recommending this Extra Space!</Text>

<Review>I just visited Extra Space in Scotts Valley and was so impressed with the manager, Zenda and her assistant, Rachael !  As a Real Estate Agent, in helping my clients, I have had the occasion to use other rental facilities in and around Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley, and this has been the best experience for me, by far. The halls and the units were very clean; the halls were well lit and this place is secure - I feel very safe in this Extra Space Storage - thanks to the management and staff (I had been at Public Storage in Santa Cruz just last year and the Manager allowed 2 homeless to sleep in the hall; this didn't stop after I complained about safety).
I will refer Extra Space Storage in Scotts Valley to all my clients and friends!</Review><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

<review>I did not end up renting here but it is NOT from a lack of customer service. Zenda was amazing - she walked me through the property and helped me secure the best storage I could even though it was with their sister property in SC. If I was in a position to support SV storage I would simply based on the outstanding  customer service I received here. Thanks again for your time Zenda and attention to detail.<//review><response>None<//response></record>

Zenda is so nice and helpful, she even went out of her way to help us. The place is clean and secure, easy to access, and the gate hours are long. We've had other storage units at different places in the area, so far this is the best.</Text>

This is a great company, especially because of Rachel's ongoing help, from the first day when I called to inquire about their services, throughout the whole moving process. The location was great the grounds are clean and my girlfriend is comfortable in going to get her stuff by herself since it's so secure.< /text>

This is a good place to store your belongings if you live anywhere in the Santa Cruz or Scotts Valley area. I live in Boulder Creek, and I'd rather use this place than closer ones. For one reason, you can pay your bill online. It's easy to get to as well because it's right off Highway 17. The customer service has always been great, and I've been a custom for over 8 years. When I left some Christmas decorations in the hallway accidentally last month, they held on to them for several weeks til I figured out where I left them! There rental prices are very competitive. They do raise their prices in January usually, but not by as much as it would cost to rent the same unit as a new customer.</text>

The Scotts Valley Extra Space Storage is definitely the cleanest and best smelling locatio far above any other Extra Space Storage or even Public Storage and I've been renting out units all over California for the past 20 years. This Extra space storage is my favorite and Zenda, the manager was professional, resourceful and friendly. The facility/reception area was spotless clean and it even smelled very nice.  Thank you for all your help Zenda.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I love this place for multiple reasons. They include but are not limited to the staff being extremely knowledgeable and helpful. They all are so ready to chat and lighten my spirits. My cat Mrs. Picklesworth is always with me and she's the best judge of character. Some might say the toughest! She loves those folks. That lovely gal Rachel in particular. The all around cleanliness...I couldn't possibly be more serious about this. Job well done guys. The proximity to the freeway is a huge plus as well. I'm always on the road and being able to just swing on by and drop off/pick up is a welcomed treat...and I'm not talking the kind I give Mrs. Picklesworth. I would say that the only downside to the place is the name of the street saying Santa's Village and there's no Santa to be seen anywhere. Oh well. Oh yeah everything is reasonably priced too.< /Review>< pics>

We were in limbo between homes for about a month and Extra Space in Scotts Valley made the experience about as painless as possible. The front office staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, and looked out for us to make sure we could keep the costs reasonable through specials and proration. The unit was very clean and the facility secure. It's got wide aisles so we could even navigate our 24 foot moving truck right up next to the unit. Thank you Zenda and Extra Space for a very positive experience! I would definitely recommend Extra Space.<//Review>

Zenda was super helpful -- providing friendly service, quick and efficient rental processing and was informative about everything offered at the facility. The Scotts Valley location is clean and well-tended too. The carts and frieght elevator work great for quick loading and unloading of items -- very well designed facility. Safe, clean, secure and above all pleasant transactions in the office with Zelda -- personable and positive (a nice change of pace when someone cares about the customers). A+</text>

Rented here over a year, and the staff has always been helpful and friendly.  I recently added another unit, and currently have both a drive-up and a inside unit and would recommend this facility wholeheartedly.

The units are always clean when given to you (after that, it's all on you), there's no bug or rodent infestations, and I've never had water incursion.   It's probably not approved, but I put in a lightbulb-to-outlet adapter in my drive-up unit so I could plug in a small shopvac and keep down the dust that my stuff seems to attract (asthma).

I've had people help me with moving things in and out, and the office staff are always watchful and attentive to who is going in and out.  It's not just that my drive-up unit is visible from the office windows, but they seem to watch the monitors too and there's cameras pointed down every corridor and at every wall of doors.

There's plentiful carts you can borrow, and the public areas including the bathrooms are clean and well lit.< /Text>

Just passing through 17 the other day and had to leave a review for one of my districts properties. The manager Zenda always has her property so clean and we'll lit if I lived in Scotts Valley I would definitely store my belongings here.

Keep up the good work Zenda and team!!!

I have been with Extra Space storage in Scotts Valley since 1-2014. Zenda the office manager and Rachel have always been accomodating even with my deliveries to my locker. No OTHER storage center has been this helpful towards me and my business deliveries. I cannot say enough good things. The extra security they have will beat other facilities and the cleanliness is what meade me leave Public Storage, Santa Cruz to the look into Scotts Valley. Easy on and off freeway location is just Awesome. If you are looking for clean and safe. Look no further!!!!</review>

The Universe came calling the day I reached out to Zenda. A lovely woman with a gentle demeanor and professional passion.
Though the physical miles separated us Zenda went out of her way to reach out and soothe the troubled waters of a Mothers passing.
With grace in her space Zenda enabled us to find the right "space" for our Mother's treasures going above and beyond to ensure we were matched up with just the right "abode" for Audrey's keepsakes.Zenda's  soothing demeanor coupled with her skill set behind the desk  enabled us to slip into something comfortable and secure!
Extra Space Storage is profoundly made better because of Zenda's sincere gift of self  which she also shepherds into her professional life.
Class act at both ends. The Brand. The Product. Win.Win.
“Tenderness and kindness are not signs of weakness and despair, but manifestations of strength and resolution.”
Thank you ESS! You hired a good one:)</Text>

I like the out of the way of normal traffic, this location offers.  Office staff is friendly, and will place occasional shipped packages in your unit for you.  Onsite bathroom available even when the office is closed.</Review>

HORRIFIC SERVICE! Needs a complete Overhaul! It took this pharmacy 43 days to have my prescription ready! I was forced to go without my heart medication for 43 days before I finally got it. My Doctor and my clinic and other organizations had to get involved. Every time I went to pick up my prescription and waiting in line for almost an hour, they told me that they did not have it and that I should call my clinic. I did called my clinic every time and they resent the prescription to Walgreens but the same story repeated for 43 days. I have decided to transfer my prescription to another pharmacy. Walgreens is near me and that is the only reason that I wanted to get it there but all the wasted time and energy is not worth it. Better to drive a little further and get my prescription in a real pharmacy.< /review>

Drive through is horrible. Even if there is no one in line, expect to wait at the very least 30 mins
I have came in the middle of the night for that reason and they still make you wait a long time.</Text>

<Text>Don't use the drive through. Currently been waiting behind one car for 20 minutes, after 10pm. Even if no one is here, it takes forever. Inside takes extremely long too. Recommend finding a different pharmacy to get prescriptions. Not worth the hassle of wasting so much time every single time.</Text>< pictures>

I don't know what everyone is complaining about, but I had a good experience. I was really tired from waiting already at the ER. After reading the reviews I had second thoughts but decided to try for myself. On the contrary to what people have mentioned it went rather well. Very professional staff and friendly too, didn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes to get my meds filled, and they were short staffed.< /review>

Pharmacy messed up entering my 1st prescription resulting in my 2nd prescription not being released.   I have to wait until next day and I'll b out of my medication tonight.

When I asked what I'm supposed to do when my meds run out and I'm in excruciating pain, the pharmacist in charge said to go to ER and the Dr there will give me another prescription.   All because the Walgreens pharmacy tech messed up and the pharmacist admitted it, but has to talk to main pharmacist when they come in next day.

The level of incompetence in this situation is almost comical, but its not because I'll be downing Ibuprofen like crazy until this gets resolved.

Thanks Walgreens for caring about the people you are paid to help.  You care so much that you will make me suffer until you go in circles to figure out which one of your id.i.ot techs cant enter simple data into your system.</review>

Before I just called the store to file a formal complaint about my frustrations, I would have rated them 1 star also. But after calling, the manager was a woman, very sweet and professional and took full responsibility  and also made sure to let me know that she will remind all of her employees the policy and I have a feeling that the issue will be fixed. I am satisfied with her answer and happy to hear that this issue will get better and now I feel better. Everyone leaving 1 star reviews, (I would have been one of them before 5 minutes ago when I called) how  about try calling and kindly voicing your frustrations to the manager who is very nice, professional and offered me an answer that satisfied me. Maybe if you, called and kindly voiced your frustrations, I'm sure they would be more than happy to help and offer a solution within ther power or controll because some things are just out of their controll like the way other customers act or the fact that "people in line and at the counter can hear your conversation." That's rediculous and what in the hell kind of complaint is that?!? And hearing the people around you in line, that's pretty much any line you stand in, not just wall greens. How about try wispering or having your conversation in a more private setting if you are so worried about privacy. like outside in your car with the windows rolled up since there might be people outside that might be able to hear your conversation also . You blame Walgreens but it sounds like a personal problem to me.  Anyways if you have complaints that are things that can help them better the service, I recommend  calling and kindly voicing your frustrations to the manager who will gladly assist you.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808e1a56c6e9ddc5:0xc869804816f51c47< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This Walgreen's will do in a pinch, but it's not great.

It was a mid-afternoon visit and yet I had to navigate the store around a lot of stocking crates like they were closed for the night.  One isle was blocked all the way across with two employees sitting on the floor with food products on the floor all around them.  They just looked at me with blank stares when I walked into the isle, and gave me the impression that I was in THEIR way.  I don't recall if the food was in boxes or directly touching the floor.  I would hope not.

I tried to ask an employee a question as he was walking around scanning items - he never heard me thanks to his earbuds and loud tunes.  (I resisted the urge to throw something at his head).

I found ONE helpful employee on the floor who pointed me to the hand soap display I couldn't find.  The lady that rang me up was helpful and polite.<//Review>< pictures>

I would avoid this place like the plague if another drugstore had a drive thru.  I cannot stand in the ALWAYS long line inside only to be told to wait again for the unfilled scripts.  If they are busy and you try to call they hang up the phone on you.  It takes a whole day to get the medication filled and home again.  It amazes me that upper management doesn't notice this retail disaster.< /Text>

I have noticed over the past several years that I have gone to Walgreens in Watsonville, Freedom blvd. that the pharmacy times are outrageously long. This is often due to low staffing and not receiving faxes for prescriptions that result in several hours of waiting to have a prescription filled. I urge people to set aside a suitable amount of time (hours) if you wish to use their services.</text>

This is the worst Walgreens. I've used Walgreens 10+ years in 3 states and never had a complaint. With this one in Watsonville 5 months in a row now and I've yet to wait less than an hour here. Even just drop offs have taken 30 minutes standing there waiting to be helped. The staff is slow and acts totally lackadaisical. Its not even that crowded compared to LA or SF locations I've used and been served fast! I'll be moving to a new pharmacy.</text>

In my many experiences at this Walgreens. I can now say that they have the worst service, the worst organizational and what I would think is logical thinking. Why on earth would Walgreens notify a precription is READY! if the insurance is having issues?? Why not leave a message about that!!! Than making me drive and waste my god damn time.
I go to "help me with something else" in the answering machine to just be sent back to "help me with something else"
I was skeptical about the other reviews but now I can day yes AVOID this place like the plague.<//Text>

Not enough staff. No privacy. Everyone in line can hear your conversation with staff/pharmacist. Most recent experience was worst: called at 11am to see if Rx was ready, was told it would be ready in 1.5 hrs. After about 3 hrs, waited in drive through line for about 30mins, only to find that my Rx was NOT ready, told to come inside & wait another 30mins, waited again for 40mins in pick up line, only to be told AGAIN, to wait as my Rx still wasn’t ready. Amazing😡! I could not believe my ears. At this point, I decided that this was too much. Switching  pharmacies for sure!< /Review>

<Review>I got my eyebrows done there and my eyelashes first she took so much hair off my arch I let it slide because I’ve been a customer here for 5 years now it was my first time getting my eyelashes done there they looked beautiful then the following day they started falling off she said it was normal so I didn’t think much of it by the second day they still falling but still looked full by the third day they completely fell off when I woke up I came to tell them and get a refund the lady who was there did not have her mask on at all I told her about it and she still wouldn’t put it on so I started recording to have proof I will never ever come here again and when I asked for the number for the owner they told me to speak to there 20 year old daughter I said no I want to speak to the real owner .<//Review>< pics>

I went for eyelash extensions a couple of days ago took some getting use to. My friends love them. I don't think I'll be getting them again it's just not my thing. The lady was super sweet and very professional. Made sure i was comfortable throughout the whole session.
I got classics.</Review>

<Review>My daughter is home....IN TEARS... Because yet again, they don't listen to what you ask them to do or NOT TO DO.
SHE ASKED TO JUST CLEAN THEM UP AND KEEP THEM THICK.
SHE CAME HIMW WITH THEM NOT ONLY TOO THIN....BUT ALSO UNEVEN.
I called and let them know what happened and the woman said to hold on.,,i did...for almost 8 minutes. Then they hung up on me.</Review>< Pics>

Save yourself from this place it's gross inside the ladies seem extremely rude they had their kids both at the job and one of the little girls was hitting my child and the ladies acted like they didn't see a thing next they did my husbands brows and the lady seemed so rushed she left his brows all red I used to come here all the time but it gets worse every time they also have a crackhead working the sign outside too 10/10 would not recommend too ghetto for me in a ghetto area</text>

I had the best experience ever! My consultant went very well and they gave such good explanation of everything, from the procedure to payment. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE in the office was so nice and accommodating. The day of my procedure it went so well and easy. All of my follow ups went great as well!! Over all I would totally recommend going here and getting the procedure.<//text>

The lasik idea as a whole is a little daunting aft first, but after learning more about the pros and the cons I decided it was a good solution for me. The procedure was a pretty quick and painless, just a little strange. Recovery takes time but it is definitely important and they do a good job or checking up on you post op. Overall, everyone was very helpful and supportive and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.</Text>

<text>Had an amazing experience at LASIK Vision Institute. Everyone was very nice, welcoming, and answered all my answers before and after surgery. Will recommend to anyone and everyone who wants 20/20 vision or better because they made it possible for me which was just breath-taking to finally be able to see without any glasses or contacts.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>Simply amazing! I went in for a consultation and was schedule for surgery the following week. Dr. Wong explained the procedure perfectly and the differences between the procedures. Patty and Erin were both super sweet and accommodating throughout the entire process. They knew I was extremely nervous so they kept checking in on me during surgery day and made me feel at ease.
Dr. Garrana was also super lovely and explained the procedure as I was in the surgical room. The staff was simply amazing.
I recommend this Orange County office to everyone considering LASIK.</Text><rating>5<//rating></record>

Came back to LVI to for my annual check up.. I am so happy that after 4 years since I had my surgery I still see 20/15... every time I come here I get excellent friendly and professional service, starting with Patty greeting me, Eli for prepping my eyes and the doctor.. I recommend Lasik Vision Institute to all my friends.. . Special thanks to Dr. Wong for making sure my test was very thorough..<//Text>

The entire experience at the LASIK Vision Institute In Orange was absolutely amazing! All of the Doctors and Assistants were highly educated and comforting throughout the whole process (the original consultation, surgery, and post consultation). I am extremely satisfied with my new vision results, which are better than those of wearing contacts or glasses. The surgery was painless and lasting no longer than about 10 minutes in the operating room. It hasn’t even been a full 24 hours post surgery, and I feel perfect, other than some eye dryness! Definitely worth your dollars spent inventing in one of the most important part of your body-your eyes! Thank you LASIK Vision Institute for making this journey easy, affordable, and encouraging!<//review>

Beware that you should get the warranty.  Initially my vision improved, but after 6 months my corrected eye was not as clear.  Now 2 years later my corrected eye is worse than before the correction and I see "floaties" in my eye. 😢< /Text>

< Review>
Came in about 2 months ago for a consultation, staff is very friendly every single time and always greeted me with a smile. Had to come back several times because Dr. Wong wanted to make sure my readings are as accurate as it can be. I had very high astigmatism and didn't think i would be a candidate for the surgery. I got really excited when i found out that i can get the Lasik procedure done.

The office and equipments used are very clean which is always comforting. They have a Keurig and a water dispenser for everyone to consume while you wait which was never long.

I didn't get my actual surgery done at this location because they don't have the machine i needed yet which was a bummer. Although, i opted to do my post op visits here because it's literally 5 minutes aways from my condo.

Super stoked to hear today that my eyes are looking great a day after my procedure. Can't wait until i heal and be good as new! So happy i came to this particular office which made the whole process a breeze.<//Review>

I am very impressed with my experience at the lasik vision institute!  All the staff are very friendly and scheduling of my appointments were easy. I was so nervous to have this surgery but the doctor addressed all my concerns and put me at ease. The day of my surgery i was able to speak to other patients who had just had their procedure and seeing/hearing their positive feedback helped to calm me.

I’m writing this review a month later after my surgery and I’m happy to report that i could see significantly better immediately after my surgery and things only got better as time continued!</Text>

I love it here! Mike and Heidi were very informative. Mike gave me so many options to choose from and didn't push me into making a decision the same day. During the procedure, for some odd reason I began to have a panic attack lol but the surgeon and techs confort me by talking to me, letting me know i was doing great. I am 1 week post op and my vision is now 20/15. Thank you LVI YES I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!</Text>

Pretty simple straightforward procedure.  took less than 10 minutes for the actual procedure. It was  completely painless. And I had almost complete 20/20 vision the day afterwards. Staff was friendly polite and courteous. And they got the Final Destination reference all the time. I promise that it's nothing like that. 😉< /Text>

Late December 2019 I scheduled a free evaluation with Lasik Vision Institute. I remember walking into the Orange branch thinking it was very unlikely I’d qualify as a candidate with my history. I had worn contacts for the passed 12 years and most of the time slept in them for days without changing. Dr. Wong assured me that she had seen worse and gave me some guidelines to follow to ensure eye health before the surgery. A little less than two weeks later I was scheduled for my All Laser Lasik app with Dr. Machat in the LA office. 28 years of practice and over 75,000 procedures literally writing the books and developing the tools I was confident in his ability. The procedure lasted maybe 15-20 mins and for every min on that table Machat kept me completely at ease. Very sharp meticulous surgeon,  just follow his instructions and your golden. Going on to my third week post I’m extremely happy with my vision. I want to thank everyone at the Orange practice for being so nice and caring! I love that you guys continue to call and check up on me 🙂<//Review>

My experience at Lasik Vision Institute in Orange was amazing. The staff and doctors were friendly, kind, and patient. They took the time to answer all of my questions, explain everything so I would understand, and made sure I was doing good the day of the surgery. The steps I needed to take prior and post the surgery they helped me to understand. Thank you for a wonderful experience!</text>

<Review>If you’ve been thinking about getting lasik, then get it done here. Great friendly staff and affordable prices. They’ll treat you well and they know what they’re doing. Been wearing glasses my whole life and now that I got lasik, my life is forever changed for the better.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>My first impression was the appointment making and confirmation process. They also let me know how long the appointment was to take and what to expect. The phone call was easy and there were no issues there. I appreciated the text and email reminders with the address listed.
The next experience I had with Lasik vision was the day of my free consultation.  The building was what I would expect on the outside, but I was hoping for a more “clinical” or “medical” feel on the inside.  I didn’t get this sense though. It felt more like a salon! There were about 3-4 girls sitting up front at the reception desk (I think at best this area was made for two). The fact that there were so many ladies wasn’t so much of an issue, but the chatter was. It just didn’t come across as professional.  This is why I mentioned it had a “salon” feel.
I got evaluated by an assistant to start. She did some scans and test to look at the shape of my eye and the surface area moisture. You could tell she was used to the same routine over and over.  She mentioned to me that my cornea was thinner than they would like to do Lasik and so they would probably recommend another procedure (that uses the same laser) that took more recovery time (but as more appropriate for my situation).
I was moved to an eye exam office and waited about 20 minutes for the doctor to arrive. I was next door to the room where they discuss the financial side and wrap up the consultation. While I was in this room waiting, I was able to overhear quite a bit of two different things going on.
The first thing I heard was a potential patient wrapping up her consultation and discussing it with the sales person. Something that I noted was the price she mentioned and the word “groupon”. Another thing I heard was an assessment where I heard the assistant pretty much tell the next customer the same exact thing that they told me.  Routine speech that did not sound customized to the patient, and the associate sounded seriously bored and disinterested.

The doctor did some tests and told me more about why they would recommend the PRK surgery rather than the standard Lasik. The doctor was friendly enough, but I couldn’t help but feel that the whole thing was all about the “sell”.
When I finally went to the last office for the salesperson to wrap things up, she basically summarized what the doctor said and asked me if I had any questions. My first question was price.  I was quoted $1700 for one eye, or just under $2000 if I wanted the service that included the “plugs” for my tear ducts (to keep eyes hydrated after surgery) and for a guarantee on the surgery that I could return to get it done again if I ever needed it in the future.
I went home and looked up this business on groupon. Lo and behold, they are on there.  Groupon was advertising Lasik for $699 (one eye). This was about what I heard them quote the lady when I overheard their conversation.  There are a couple of issues I have with this.  Firstly, I understand that I was recommended for PRK which was a slightly different version of Lasik, I can’t imagine why though the price would suddenly jump from $699 per eye to $2000! This leads me to my second point. I don’t like it when businesses do this (quote a much higher price for a service they offer on groupon for less).  This has happened to me before (ironically with a salon which I compared this place to).  My last and third point is that being on Groupon is a HUGE deterrent for me from using Lasik Vision Institute.  This is a medical procedure and pretty serious (considering it affects one of the major senses and is in an area with major amounts of nerve endings).
I also looked up the doctor who would be performing the surgery after this whole experience. At best she has “mixed” reviews. Some good; but some quite bad.
I still want to get my vision corrected with Lasik. Just not with Lasik Vision institute.<//Text>< user>

< review>
Until just recently, I have trusted this office for my eye sight. But I did not follow up last year for my annual eye exam, and today my eyesight is as bad as it was before surgery. I went to the office to see what they could do for me, hoping for an exam on their "for life guarantee " which I purchased with my surgery.  My point is, They were not willing to help me in any way without paying more money for an exam, and any necessary correction.    I am very disappointed I have to go to another company to repair my eyes. For anyone considering this procedure, be sure to follow up each year as required, or this company will just say tough luck!       I knew my surgery was too good to be true. at least it lasted a year!</review>

<Review>I had my surgery done almost a month ago and should have reviews sooner! My eyes were terrible before the surgery. I got PRK which the doctors and staff told me would be a tough recovery compared to normal lasik. They answered all the questions I had about anything relating to the surgery. I had about 3 appointments before the actual surgery day. Everyone there is extremely nice and caring about their customers.
As for recovery I am doing great now. Apparently larger prescription they correct, the more time it takes for your eyes to stabilize. So I have periods of slight blurriness and near perfect vision throughout the day. After the first week, I had my first follow-up appt. I had 20/20 then which was pretty amazing. Of course initial few days after the surgery my eyes felt like someone put hot sauce in them. But I was prescribed vicodin and 3 types of eye drops to help with the pain and recovery. Over the past month, my eyes have been getting more and more stable. As I write this my vision is just barely blurry, but about an hour ago it was probably better than 20/20. After the first 10 days I was driving myself easily.
I still accidentally try to pull off my glasses when I am going to wash my face or anytime I normally would. And then I get so happy I don't wear glasses haha. I definitely have to wear sunglasses outside and for the first week inside too, just because light sensitivity. I can probably handle not wearing sunglasses outside. I never did that while I had glasses and now I realize that I should have been wearing them outside anyways.
I paid for the groupon which was about 1400 for both eyes. But I opted in for all the extra things such as tear plugs, warranty on the surgery, and some new software that makes the eye surgery slightly better. So it came to about 3300 with everything including medication. I see now that it's the best investment I've ever made on myself.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

This place is the worst for customer service I would never go back here.  They scheduled me then tried to say they didn't. The worst.
Here is a clue.  Look and see if they have a contact page. If not then there is no one that you can complain to so you will not get results.  I will never give this place any more business.   Take your money elsewhere.<//text>

Had the steak fajitas with black beans, rice and tortillas. Large portions and very delicious. I'm glad there is still a Baja Fresh around since they closed so many of them in the past. Anything I've ever ordered was fresh and delicious.<//review>

I give this place a 1 star because of how dirty the restaurant was. The bathroom, the floors and the soda counter. Unfortunately, the restaurant was basically empty so I can't associate the blame to a busy croud. The is an A grade from the health department posted but if they came when we were there, that wouldn't be the case. I really like Baja Fresh and have never seen one this neglected. As I read through the reviews, this restaurant has had previous customers with the same cleanliness concerns.</text>

Its so frustrating to watch staff move so leisurely, not one ounce of hurrying the pace. I was 4th in line. Cashier talked slow, pushed buttons even slower, and then had to pause between orders. The cook was running in and out for pickup orders. They both kept looking at the line that was growing longer like they were being disturbed, or disrupted, as if the patrons were burdensome. I walked out.  Too much!<//Review>

My favorite place to get a burrito. Everything tastes fresh and they have the best salsa selection. It is a mexi-cali style place but they are addicting.</Text>

<review>My husband raves about this place as when he's in the city working he comes here. Finally I was with him and he brought me. Fresh is right! Purple onion, red pepper, cotija, fresh avocado and grilled shrimp in this fantastic salad! Every bite chopped to the perfect size. I can't say enough about the dressing, SO much flavor. Remember to try the black salsa from the sparkling clean salsa bar. I'm not exaggerating! Never had black salsa and I don't  know how they make it but it's amazing with chips and on their wahoo tacos.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9nUJymKt275cdU1sNPwexvn8ExKkWgSez8E5e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c33582882cba35:0x396bbd6a4581969b</gmap_id></record>

< Review>
The food here is really delicious and the freshness matches the advertising. We decided to come in for some Mexican flair and lucked out, because today kids eat free! (Sat. Feb, 8, 2020) The service was friendly and fast. They even gave us free chips while we waited. The salsa bar is excellent with a variety of choices including: mango, hot, medium, verde, pick de gallo and their signature which is delicious.

<review>I always order the shrimp tostada salad without cheese and the shell. Always fresh and good tasting.  I think they forgot the dressing BUT they did remember extra pico and salsa on the side.  The baños are closed due to covid.< /review><date>1601752437628< /date>< userid>

It's been ages since I had their food.  I decided to order their new Chicken Sandwich since from the photo, it looks tasty; so why not give it a try. I am so glad I ordered it.  The chicken pieces were large and the best part was that it wasn't dry or hard.   It had large chunks of Avocado, and a decent amount of lettuce.  I poured their hot salsa into the sandwich to give it an extra kick to the flavor. The sandwich tasted great. I was also enjoying their chips and salsa while waiting for my food.  Coming here really brought back memories of my childhood, when I used to come here just to eat their chips... hahaa..< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>Best food best staff.

Update 9-9-19. We already came back few times in  between last review and this one.

The manager always have smiling face and welcoming. The food is as great as before. You will never go wrong going to this Baja Fresh. Also on top of that the cost is not that expensive.

If you are going for first time, then don't miss its mango salsa. Other salsas are great too.<//text>< Name>

< Review>
Was trying to go to senor Baja's.. For some fish tacos  A familiar place which has great food and reasonable prices.... Google sent me here . I am disappointed . I payed 34 dollars for 8 tacos .the (fish stick) yes I'm calling it a fish stick because that's what it looked like. It was over cooked and we threw 2 away .the gal was nice and gave me 2 bags of tortilla chips,the best part of what I ate was the free chips.  I miss the senor Baja's on foothill and haven.<//Review>

One of my favorites. Good food at a reasonable price, fish, shrimp and other burritos or tacos all made considerably fresh. And I love the mango salsa on almost everything.<//text>

<text>Food is always great and tastes so clean. You will never get that "why did I eat that" feeling from Baja Fresh. The only downside was the AC for half of the building was broken so only the front portion of the restaurant was cool. I never kick a restaurant down a notch on aesthetics when theyre food is so amazing. Highly recommended to anyone that loves Mexican food thats fresh and doesn't make you hate yourself after eating it.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c33582882cba35:0x396bbd6a4581969b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I personally love Baja Fresh! At first I couldn’t find this location because I’m not from the area, it’s a little hidden with all the trees around it, but it was really good just like I remember 😁 they still have the Chili lime shrimp salad. My fave🙌🏻< /Text>

If you like Americanized Mexican food like Chipotle then it’s decent food. They don’t have small tacos which was annoying but they’re customer service was AWESOME which is the only reason they get two stars.< /text>< Pics>

The food here is excellent. Prices a bit higher than I expected. Hard to get lunch under 10 bucks.</text>

< review>
I was told that Baja Fresh is good, but this one location was disappointing. The steak  and shrimp bowl tasted weird; it was bland with a strange after-taste. The chicken was pretty good, but overall it was below average. It was my first time coming there and it was at night on the week-end, but hardly anybody was there. I hope other Baja Fresh locations aren't as bad as this one.<//review>

<review>Worst experience I've ever had at this location #122. Restaurant was filthy, salsa bar was empty and dirty. They only had one girl at the counter and 2 cooks. No one was cleaning the dining area and maintaining the salsa bar.  Food took forever because the counter girl went to the back office and I'm assuming she was on the phone for a good 20 min while everyone's food was sitting there getting cold.  We finally get our food and the order was wrong.  I mean,  come on. They fixed the order and by the time we left there and got our food home we had to microwave everything.  To top it off the shrimp tacos only had about 3 tiny shrimps in each.  It was like eating cabbage tacos.  NOT WORTH $40!!!!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Meh, not impressed with food nor service.  Oddly enough, "Combo" lunch doesn't include a drink.  Tea is NOT FRESH brewed, seriously?  Can't say we'll be back.  Had such high hopes.< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>First off, service was excellent. The girl at the counter war super nice. Too bad the food was disappointing but that's not her fault. So one star for that.
I'm just about done with this place with their filling proportions. The chicken burrito that I usually order cost almost two dollars more here than the other location I used to go to. However the burrito size was exceptionally large by which I initially dismissed the high price. But when you get through the entire burrito just to experience 70% rice and maybe 20% veggies and 10% chicken you can't say the size of the burrito justifies the 9$ price tag. I had a very large filling burrito that tasted mostly of rice. Sorry but I'm not visiting another baja fresh again. I'll be sticking to locally owned authentic mexican restaurants, or pollo lock, but I'm scratching this one off. Did I mention their bathrooms are always gross? This location was no different.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c33582882cba35:0x396bbd6a4581969b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic service. I didn't like my chicken bowl and asked for a change. The manager, Anam ( as I remembered) was very friendly and brought pen and paper to write down what I wanted in my bowl.</Review>

<text>This particular restaurant usually good has gone down fast. Fisrt, the service is really bad…there is no water so if you dont like sodas you are out of luck.
I found out that they are selling the place so the owner doesnt care.<//text></record>

Drove 35 mins in traffic to get here and staff was rude. They stood behind the grills talking for almost 10 minutes before someone finally came to take our order. I ordered the dos manos burrito like I used to get in ventura county almost on a daily basis. She rudely told me that they don't have that burrito at this location, that if it's not on the menu under the burrito, they don't have it. I'm a major fan of baja fresh but this location is terrible. No wonder why there was no one in the restaurant. Never again will I come back to this location, and I will definitely deter anyone from going here.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>(Translated by Google) The characteristics of the meal are "fresh", "ready-made", "delicious", especially the "FAJITA" dish, which is particularly delicious, "beef"
It's like a grilled steak, cut into strips and delicious.
"Black Beans" are also very special, with high nutritional content and delicious.
CHIP is also freshly fried, and the SAUCE is fresh and diverse.
Good location and staff near Ontairo Mill
Very kind. 💪😃

(Original)
餐㸃特色是「新鮮」、「現做」、「好吃」，尤其是「FAJITA 」這道料理，特別的好吃，「牛肉」
像烤好的五分熟牛排，切成一條一條，好吃極了。
「黑豆」也很有特色，營養成分高，又好吃。
CHIP也是現炸，供應的SAUCE，新鮮多樣美味。
位於Ontairo Mill附近，位置好，工作人員
都很親切。💪😃< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c33582882cba35:0x396bbd6a4581969b</Gmap_id></record>

My parents and I love coming to this place, every time I come I always get the beef with red rice. I also like the pig kidney they have too. All of their food are super flavorful and the staff is super friendly.< /Review>

Love the special dry noodle there.  Everything was good. If you are not afraid of trying pig organs, this is a good place to try.</Text>

<Text>Good to destination if you’re craving noodles! They’re known for their house special which I would recommend. One thing that I love about this place is your ability to pick what noodles you like. You can also mix and match the noodles which is a plus. Parking can be tough depending on what time you go. Expect a wait too during the weekends but worth it.<//Text><Date>1567476161468< /Date><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

Wonderful service. I have been coming here for a long time. The chef brought me extra soup and a shrimp because they didn't add all 3 shrimps. Excellent service and amazing honesty.< /Text>

One of the popular Vietnamese noodle soup restaurant. The taste not as good as before. But still keep the average . The fired rice cake  added egg is very yummy.  Very warm service . Reasonable price. Coconut dessert is very good.</Text>

Top 3 noodle places ever!  Love the fact that you can mix and match your noodles choices ranging from pho, rice, and egg noodles thick and skinny.  There is a huge selection of different types of toppings you can get.  You must MUST try the noodles topped with pig liver.  It will change your life!!!<//Text>

Been in this unit for three years and always find the staff and David very friendly.  Prices are fair for the area and the units and property are always clean.  I would quickly give them 5 stars if not for a problem that they are "technically right" about.  Despite this issue I would recommend them for both storage and truck/trailer rental!< /review>

David is heaven sent, and staff is very friendly and helpful. Moved from Wisconsin, and had a hard time finding available storage close to city I was living in. David found me a unit, and also helped anyway he could to make my experience there delightful. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!< /review>

<Review>Break ins often in the area.  Excellent service at the counter.  Manager not approachable and not willing to discuss first time late fees where other U -haul storages are usually more willing to listen.

Update. I stopped receiving any (email text messages) after review and get a sudden notice of lien without any previous notification

Update. They are harassing my references as soon as I'm late. I guess I should have storage top of mind.  Don't store here if you ever pay late.<//Review>< Rate>

<Review>I've had the pleasure of working with Ian Lenahan now for about 5 months. Since I've signed up for 220 Marketing he has been my contact person for everything. He's great about scheduling our monthly calls where all my concerns and ideas are addressed. He's responsive and very knowledgeable and has helped me better understand and grow our agency's online presence. You simply can't go wrong with 220 Marketing and with Ian. This isn't a sign up and forget it kind of deal...they are with you every step of the way and are committed to growing your business.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I’ve been a customer of 220 Marketing for 2.5 years.  I have always enjoyed the service and find everyone I’ve ever worked with to be polite and professional.  I didn’t think it could be any better until I decided to make some changes to my site.  My Tech Joshua was the consummate professional.  What I was trying to accomplish was pretty intricate, but despite the many changes I made, (and the changes to the changes), Joshua remained patient, professional and very very competent.  He even made suggestions that helped make some critical decisions.  5-stars for 220-Marketing!  If you need a web presence this is the 1 stop shop you should go to!  -TSR< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
I have been a client of 220 marketing for over three years. I was apprehensive in the beginning as I was not sure what the relationship would bring. I signed up for marketing and social media support. In the beginning it took a few months for the organic leads to begin to flow, but after 6 months I was getting 3 to 4 emails a day plus a coupe of phone calls each day. I meet monthly with marketing and social media consultants and they have been very supportive in keeping me and my site up to date and helping to increase my organic lead flow. Additionally, if i have any questions or need any support calling for help through the help desk has always been a positive experience.
If you are concerned about value, as I initially was, let me assure you that for me 220 Marketing has been a cornerstone of my business and my success.<//Review>

So far the detail, insight, service, responsiveness, planning, education, have been excellent. The web site is designed for my business and the support in tech, marketing, sales and setup have been exceptional. I purchased my site to replace the one from EZLynx about Mid-June. So far glad I did.< /review>

<Review>This company has been amazing to work with.  I put tons of value into a company who provided great customer service and this company excels in this category. I literally have never been on hold for longer than 30 seconds anytime I have called them.  They are also proactive with their customers in educating you and making sure you are using all of their services they offer. Could not recommend them enough for your business!< /Review>< Pictures>

I am the Director of Team Development with the Mitchell Chernock Team in Benicia California. I have been using the 220 marketing group for about a month now and am  amazed at how everyone there is so helpful and kind. Old fashion customer service that they provide is rare in today’s world. Josh and Ian have been especially helpful, but everyone at 220 Marketing have gone above and beyond in helping my team build a plan for success.< /Review>

<Review>Ian Lenahan, specifically, has been a great help to our business. He truly wants to help us succeed in growing our business and having our marketing work for us. He is responsive and professional.

My only complaint is with 220 itself, in the fact that I don't think they hold their reps accountable for making sure the marketing and lead generation is successful. I do believe Ian is intrinsically motivated and will help us get the results we need, we have seen a decrease in leads however, and are hoping he is able to get us back on track.<//Review>< Pics>

<resp>{'time': 1582065230646, 'text': "Dear Mr. Sanders. We appreciate you being a customer of ours for over 5 years. We also appreciate the good review you left us a few years back. We completely understand your frustration with having a hard time getting people to opt in to receiving email from you. This can be a difficult process. I can assure you that we did everything in our power to try and help you increase your email base. Unfortunately, the law requires us to be able to prove that email recipients have opted in to receiving email from you.  This is done to keep you compliant and to make sure that your emails get delivered. This was explained to you in detail multiple times from the very beginning of our relationship. We even helped you move your email marketing over to another provider that did not have as strict opt in requirements and you were still not satisfied.  There really wasn't any more that we could do to satisfy you. You then wrote several bad reviews related to this issue. We continued to try and help you. Once you became combative and threatening to our staff we made the decision to part ways with you. This is a decision that we take very seriously. Your last day of service with us was on October 31st, 2019.  Its now 4 months later and you are continuing to write bad reviews about the same issue. What can we do to get this harassment to stop? You are intentionally hurting a lot of good people who work hard."}< /resp>< gmap_id>

He stated my corporate already approved my company for affiliation. I kindly told him that I cannot approve anything regarding money. The guy literally said to me" You dont have any money"?  Ahahaha what a joke. He was told to never call my company again.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Josh & Ian at 220 marketing is always there to help us make changes, answer questions, help us grow our online presence and without fail they have delivered. They answer the phone and take care of our issues when they arise and they do it usually while on the first phone call.
I’ve had only a few issues with the website but they jumped right on it and got it fixed within minutes.  Our seo is ranking us top of the list in several markets.  I’d recommend 220 marketing if you want to grow your business online with organic seo.< /text><name>Leonard Manos</name><Date>1569544328708< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><userid>113696522319192190162<//userid><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80deaafc3b56fb55:0x8b4a219fb5e85ff8< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Didn't produce the results we wanted, which happens. My problem is they did zero to help migrate my page back to original hosting company. They're quick to take....not so quick to return. Told me to call my hosting company to have them redirect my site back. Maybe that's the only way to make it happen, but they did have login credentials to take, why not to send back.

Here's a mistake I made which I can't blame anyone but me....signed a contract that I said I would never do with another 'seo' company. Appears they have a lot of good reviews. Hopefully I'm the anomaly...but I won't be signing anymore contracts with "online experts"</Text><Rate>1< /Rate><username>Ray Roll< /username><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80deaafc3b56fb55:0x8b4a219fb5e85ff8</Gmap_id><user>116346073193438743286<//user></record>

Unsolicited email I sent to a supervisor at 220 Marketing:
Hi Sam, my name is Steve Shalaby. I signed up with My 220 a while back and you guys built me the best website I ever had (and I've had a few since 2006). Everything from the design process down to SEO portion has been nothing short of stellar. Which brings me to the reason for my email. I've been dealing with an SEO genius named Shane Libow. He schedules weekly calls with me to help me with SEO. I cannot tell you how much I've learned from him. Not just is he truly in his element discussing (and teaching) the finer points of SEO, but he actually has priceless knowledge about my industry (mortgages and real estate). With that knowledge, he's helped me choose the right key words, told me what's too much to pay for in adwords, helped me optimize pages, etc, etc.

Anyway, this guy deserves some recognition as he sincerely helps with client retention. How can I ever dream about switching website companies knowing this degree of "badass" is at my fingertips.

I'd say the "employee of the month" parking space is in order at a minimum....if not, then a $10k bonus should do the trick.<//Text>

<Review>220 Marketing has always been very responsive to our needs.  You can use the "cookie cutter" approach to the website where you have very little to do - they do most of it, to much more innovative ways to use it.  We have customized our newsletter each month and also customized our real estate search page.  They have always been very helpful to us when we get in "over our heads" and need help changing things.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80deaafc3b56fb55:0x8b4a219fb5e85ff8<//GmapID></record>

I've been a client of 220 Marketing 2010 and have received nothing but the best service! I have a weekly marketing meeting with Angel where she helps me figure out what steps we should be taking to generate more business. She holds my hand and is very patient considering my technological skills are not that strong. Everyone there has always been very helpful and I am very appreciative of that from this company.

Without 220 Marketing, my business may not have survived the Real Estate meltdown.

I would recommend 220 Marketing to anyone looking for a great, industry specific website and I'll be a customer of 220 Marketing as long as my business is open.

Tell them that you saw my review and decided to check them out! You'll be very glad you did! Ed B.<//text>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Sorry to say the experience with 220 Marketing has been one of many challenges. Beware it is sold as a month to month contract BUT if you cancel and have not been with them a year you are charged a $200 cancellation fee, as per a phone conversation this morning with Steve Cannady. He also mentioned this morning the cancellation fee is in my contract.
My website has not up been up and running properly since the beginning. There have been numerous calls back and forth and an extreme amount of time spent by all parties to correct the site to no avail. I spoke to Charles Graham last week and he agreed that with so many issues they would like to make up for and start a new. After considering that for the day which was January 19, I emailed Charles and Steve and let them know I did not want to move forward.I appreciated their wanting to make things right but at this time I'm not interested in continuing.
Hence the above conversation with Steve Cannady this morning. Steve called today following up.
I am still not interested and felt the call today did not go or end well. I felt the tone changed with cancellation. Buyer Beware!<//Review><username>Debbie Burke</username>< Rate>

<Review>I have been a customer of 220 Marketing for several years and just got connected to Ian McHugh within the last three months.  Ian grabbed hold of my account and took me to new heights.  He helped me make changes in my LinkedIn profile and data and helped me become more professional in my approach.  Ian just got connected to my Facebook business page and he is now making that page come alive.  I am looking to bigger and better results from my interaction with Ian..<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Just received an unsolicited call from this company. I am surprised that these folks are in business of marketing.  Rude,  is the first word that comes to mind. I asked him to remove me from there data base that i wasn't interested in their services.  He continued, of course, to say that he wasn't selling anything.   I said, "thank you but i am not interested".   He continued to say that my picture on my website matched my attitude... ? Is that how we sell professionally these days? get a "no thank you, not interested" and the response is an insult?  best of luck.. you suck.<//Review>

<Text>I have been a customer service specialist for 220 Marketing for 2 1/2 years now and I have loved every minute of it! I am so lucky to work with Trevor Niarchos and Korrie Scales as my management.

I love coming into work everyday knowing that we have the greatest team of employees and that I will be able to help our clients with anything they need. We work hard, but play harder and that is a great thing to be able to say about a job!<//Text>< pictures>

Ian McHugh is my marketing and social media consultant with the 220 Marketing Group. He, along with his colleagues Heather Hundley and Shane Libow, are some of the most amazing professionals one could hope to work with. I am a new commercial mortgage broker facing the tough challenges of surviving in an unforgiving terrain, yet with the help of Ian and his colleagues at 220 Marketing, l am not only learning to “swim with the sharks”, but l am becoming more and more confident about my prospect of succeeding, where normally l would have been afraid of failing because l would have been simply overwhelmed with having to do too much on my own. Their patience and support is priceless, and l would wholeheartedly recommend Ian and the team at 220 Marketing to anyone wanting to get the biggest bang for their marketing dollars (hands down).</Text>

We were a new branch when we contracted with 220Marketing for web design. They held our hands throughout the technical and creative process. Our homepage has links to our Facebook, Blog and Google review, making it convenient for our clients.

Our dedicated 220Marketing rep continues to meet with us regularly, offering suggestions on how we can improve our website's effectiveness and generate new leads. We have established a strong working relationship with our marketing rep and feel he is not just a contractor but a member of our team.

We highly endorse 220Marketing<//Review>

I have worked with Sam at 220 for a year and he has been extremely helpful in helping us with our on-line presence.  Facebook, directory services etc.  They are great and because I don't know a ton about this stuff he really helps make it simple!</Review>

LOVE 220
My ratings have never been better....and I love the pricing!
I used to have to be signed up with 3-4 companies to handle my social networking needs....now I only need 220.  The entire staff couldn't be nicer and they're always coming up with great new ideas...< /text>

I can’t say enough good things about 220 marketing and their team.  I am so happy I chose to work with them. I love my website and the best thing about it is that it is not a cookie cutter website.  I am able to customize it and make it my own, and add my own content.  I’m so happy with their team, every time I call I get the support I need.  They just built  my business Facebook page, and It looks great.  They didn’t just build it, they walked me through it to help me understand how to get the best use of it.  I just pay them to work on my SEO’s to help me move up the rank in Google.  I can’t wait to see how this goes.  I highly recommend that you 220 Marketing for your website or any of their products.

I am a very satisfied customer,

This company called claiming to be affiliated with google and that google needed me to verify my business or it would be erased from the search engine and the cost would be $299. I paid it and then come to find out it is free to do through googles website.  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.<//review>

My Independent Insurance agency has been with 220 Marketing for 7 months and the experience has been great! I have mostly worked with Sam, but everyone I have worked with has been knowledgeable, professional and always ready to help. Sam and I have had several calls going over website design, content and photos. He has helped me with reviews, attracting leads and social media sites. We have received over 30 leads through the website in the last few months which is what we were hoping to do with this new website. If you are looking into marketing your agency with professionals, these guys are the way to go!

The staff was very patient as well as knowledgeable.  However, a couple of weeks ago I was looking for ways to cut back on office expenses and decided to cancel my services with 220 and have a friend to build me a free website. At that time I was referred to Kyle O'Hare to complete the transaction, and he did what any great customer service person would do, and that's to save the business.  Kyle went over and above to provide me with excellent customer service. I shared this experience with my customer service staff...Customer Service goes a long way...So because of Kyle O'Hare...I am a lifetime member!!

220 has been great.  I was marketing to by 220 to convert my old ala mode website, and I am very happy I took them up on it.  Their marketing team knows what they're doing.  I started getting help from Hannah and she was amazing at teaching me a lot of techniques to rank highly in the SE's, as well as other ways to drive traffic to my site.  When Hannah was promoted, I worked with several other staff, most recently Steven.  Steven is also very knowledgeable, very helpful, and has helped me gameplan to take the site to the next level.  My 220 site is on page 1 of google for very pertinent searches, and page 2 for general searches for a wide area (page 2 out of roughly 30 million search results....pretty good stuff).  With 220's help I have been able to generate quality leads, as well as add to my list of marketing partners as I can use the site to offer them benefits as well.  I'd highly recommend 220 marketing.< /Text>

<Review>I have been with 220 marketing for about 8 months now all I can say is this company is amazing they are helpful respond quickly and can not remember anytime I could not reach them , people like Steven Sacro and Sam And Krista, and Steve Candi  and Dave are the  soul of this company they make you feel like they really want to help you achieve what your goals , they all have a wealth of information that is essential to understanding how social media and net working is done as you can tell I am very happy I came on board with 220 and look forward to doing more business as a result of joining them.

Website is awesome. It reallly gives you an instant professional look with professional capabilities all of the banks have. The marketing staff that helps you market yourself on other platforms is second to none. It's like having your own free marketing consultant. Ours has optimized our facebook and linked in pages and is awesome. But the problem is that we got the 220 website specifically as a way to stay in touch with our realtors and past clients through email drip campaigns. We were so excited to be able to do drip campaigns off of it and automatically send the stay in touch newsletter. Then, after paying, we were heartbroken to learn that everyone had to opt in to get our emails. Unlike Mail Chimp, which sends the email with an opt out at the bottom, our folks would have to opt in. Only 17 out of 169 did, making the email function useless. We had envisioned building drip campaigns for every stage of the loan process, including our new leads. Forget it. Impossible to get them to opt in. We are now back to mail chimp. It's maddening. I write this review not to be mean, but in hopes that they will change the opt-in policy to an opt out policy. Until then, count your 220 website useless for email drip campaigns. Also, of the few who did opt in, the 220 monthly email seems to go into their junk mail, so they don't see it anyway. GRRRRR!  Update: After reading this review, 220 moved all our contacts over from 220 to mailchimp for free. (There is normally a fee for that.) We have an appointment scheduled with our marketing consultant to learn how to send the 220 monthly email using mailchimp. Wish we could send it directly through the site, but the workaround isn't bad.</Review>

How can’t you love this place? They really take care of every single detail so when you get home with your food you can rearrange it however you want to!
Btw, their soup makes you feel like home!<//review>

<text>I rarely order food to go because of income constraints. But I recently decided to splurge, and ordered Broccoli and Beef from Tahoe. The broccoli was absolutely inedible. I love raw broccoli, and always cook it al dente. But the broccoli in this order was like chewing on tree roots! The beef was FULL of grizzle...and the amount of beef was insulting. I have lived in Forestville for 41 years. The Chinese restaurant here has had multiple owners. The current owners are a pale comparison to the ones of the old days. So very disappointing.</text></record></dataset><record>

Just back from Tahoe Chinese.  Go there often.  Have great lunch specials.  Big selection.  They make great war won ton soup.  Just had it for my lunch was great as usual. Have never got a bad dish or meal.  Owners are very nice and friendly.  There are there every day. Always makes you feel welcome.<//Review>

Most uncomfortable feeling/ service we’ve ever had in Sonoma County. Waited for them to take our order and the staff just looked away and acted busy.  I wouldn’t recommend this place unless you’re blonde w/ blue eyes. They seem to get Served right away.< /review>

Yes, the owner is a ass sometimes, but his wife holds it down in the kitchen, and the soup and food is top notch. I saw Charlie sheens brother in there last weekend.<//Review>

<Text>Tasty, tasty, and tasty! Clean beef broth and mouth watering beef, this is the place to go. The area is “interesting” BUT there’s a large parking lot next to this establishment. I recommend the “number two”, which is a beef soup noodle dish with all the magical beef parts 🤤<//Text>< pics>

<review>Came here on Sunday morning - it is spacious and we got seated right away.
We ordered the bun bo hue and the pho #3.

The bun bo hue was delicious! I would come back here just for this noodle soup again. It looked like it wasn't as rich and flavorful as usual, but when we tried it- it was a really light but flavorful broth. Most bun bo hues have lots of spice, but in this one you could taste the broth and had the perfect level of spice.

The pho was pretty good as well. The noodles weren't as chewy as I would like, but the broth was good and all the meats were also quite good. It came with soft tendons and fatty meat slices, which I don't normally each but we're good.

Parking is available on the street - we didn't have any trouble when we went and got a spot across the street.
Prices are also reasonable with $8-9/bowl.<//review>< gmap_id>

food is good, but if you order from Postmates they have fake prices on the site and then double them without telling you. not worth $20 for a cup of pho in the slightest. really misleading so just pick it up yourself or dine in.</review>

The food is awesome, authentic and the environment gives you that family feeling. I have had Vietnamese food before and this place ranks up with the best of them. Taste, quality and quantity is all there.
The hostess/waitress was very nice and sweet. She took her time explaining the different dishes to make sure you pick exactly what you want. Because of her the restaurant gets a extra star in my book. Great job hostess/waitress!! 10/01/18< /review>

< Review>
I've been to numerous Pho spots and this place just sticks out to me the most. Their rice dishes are super delicious!!! They use this crispy bacon pieces (not bacon bits) as a topping in their rice dishes alongside with green onions and fish sauce, it enhances the dish to the extreme. Not many Vietnamese places do this so if you do drop by, definitely order and try one of their rice plates.</Review>

<review>I've been to many Pho places, but this one is special.  Their flavors are subtly more intense from their broth to their available sauces.  For example this HOME MADE sauce has lemon grass and anchovies and these folks make it themselves.  This go around, I tried their combo rice plate which had a broad variety of items.  The sauce brought the dish to a whole new level of great.<//review>< resp>

Been a fan for years, when we are in the area always try to make an excuse to visit. Their service and food quality has been very  consistent over the past 6 years. Big flavors, fresh herbs, and some more complex platters make this a perennial favorite...<//Text>

I'm sure the food is good (per the reviews). But in the 15 minutes of sitting here, no one has acknowledged my table. I've finished my water, this review, and we're all off to Pho Vy (401 International Blvd in Oakland).</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7-Ls4loy6rcKEQPGaum9Do5gtbcdEah3XUM_5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808f8726bba02d7b:0xc3cff9842b18a1b2<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>We ate lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. We had spring rolls, pho and marinated pork chops. The place was packed with families but we were served fairly quickly. The food was tasty and the portions were not too big or too small. The staff were friendly. This place is reachable by public transportation. Well-located and easy to park. Private parking. Tasty noodles and pho. Around 10usd a dish. Service very professional and staff very nice. Recommended.</review>< time>

Great Korean style ribs with crunchy pork belly sprinkled on top and fish sauce on the side. Delicious spicy lemongrass at every table and yummy pho. The wings are great- do crispy and fatty with a burst of flavors.</text>

We had the chicken wings and they were just the right amount of spiciness.  Wings are always good. The pho is always good too. Our family loves the food at this place because it is always consistent, always delicious.</text>

<text>All pho restaurants are the same to me but what makes this place special is their home-made pepper sauce - I seriously go just for the sauce and it’s the only thing I add to my broth and it’s already so good!</text>< Pics>

So good and fresh. The beef with vermicelli noodles was delicious. Only $10.95 for giant bowl. Great meal for great deal. Highly recommend. Only drawback is the neighborhood isn't the best. They have parking. But don't leave bags in your car.< /text>

One of the best Pho. Love their pho soup and the soup from the extra tendon. Very traditional and simple. I eat here once a week and I recommend the pho combo. Ask for extra tendon.< /Review>

< Review>
Overview: Food is okay. Reminiscent of old Kevin's Noodle House location nearby that recently closed. Service staff is friendly. Details below.

Food: The food is pretty standard. Menu offers little choices in the way of vegetarian or pure seafood options. Only one menu item out of 70 or so offers shrimp, no other seafood to be found. Pho is standard, tasted the same after eating it five times now. When the restaurant does something just okay, but does that thing consistently, all one can really praise is consistency.

Price point: standard price point, but could be better for the food offered.

Atmosphere: sort of dim lighting, restaurant does not feel clean.

Service: staff is friendly. Does not check in on you, but does fill up water.<//Review>

Try the shredded pork with coconut milk. It's DELICIOUS!!! Pho has good meat to noodle ratio and the veggies are fresh...none of those brown bean sprouts. My friend loves the steamed chicken with ginger. Menu is large and there's plenty of seating. There isn't a day I've gone with the place empty.

Small parking lot attached to the building. Make sure you remember your table number when you go up to pay. Accepts credit cards.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Pro Tip: no need to ask for the check, walk up to the register and tell them your table number. This is usually customary for most Vietnamese restaurants.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

<Review>You would think it was a hole in the wall restaurant if you drove by the location, you would also wonder why the parking lot is full and no parking can be found.  We walked in and had to put our name on a waiting list to grab a table, the wait was about 30 minutes as it was a holiday weekend and other restaurants in the area were closed.  I was reading the reviews online about the beef noodle soup and just had to try it. I was very surprised, Delicious. The only iffy thing that I ate was the concealed pig blood cubes. The egg rolls were good with lettuce and mint.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f8726bba02d7b:0xc3cff9842b18a1b2< /gmapID></record>

Its always crowded but worth the wait. Local tip: Try the chicken pho and if you are adventurous ask for the chicken with the bone in which comes with a ginger sauce. Yes, the Pho is the best in Oakland. I’m Vietnamese and I approve this review.</text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Bought a bun thit nuong and a kids meatball pho, they charged $25+ because apparently it's $1 for each to-go container (3 containers total for my order, one of which was a paper box) and $.25 for the bag it was put in. So $3.25 just for the to-go containers...What a money hungry restaurant to charge so much for a to go order...The kids pho was a half filled box that was mostly veggies...Will never go here again for to go.<//Text><Name>helen luu</Name><UserId.>111272219003406870805< /UserId.><gmap_id>0x808f8726bba02d7b:0xc3cff9842b18a1b2</gmap_id></record>

Great pho place in an ok neighborhood for an authentic experience. Stay with the standard broth and beef options. I have tried a few other dishes but they haven't quite delivered. Their beef pho works every time to get rid of early cold / flu symptoms. Maybe it is the basil, or perhaps the broth. It simply works for me!<//text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>There isn't many pho restaurants that can get a 5 star since many restaurants do not have a turn over rate that the noodles and ingredients are usually average to below par quality. With that being said, Pho Ao Sen has a decent turnover rate   meaning there is always fresh ingredients on hand. Good pho are hard to come by and hard to recommend since the quality varies by the time of the day. Best eaten before 3 pm after that, what ever is left is left and that will sit for however long it takes until the nest customer makes a request for a bowl of pho. When compared to the other surrounding pho restaurants, this location serve up a better version of the pho bowl in many instance. There is plenty of seating inside the establishment for everyone and the menu is extensive but I personally still recommend their more popular dishes as the turnover rate is higher. If you're ever in the area and craving for pho, drop by this joint and request for an extra large pho bowl and maybe a triple color drink to go along with that for a balance meal.< /review>< pictures>

Love this place, not fency but food is delicious. Spring Rolls is my favorite and beef noodle soup #01 is aust. Chicken wings also great, sometimes I order the pork chop, fried spring with vermicelli. Although there are lots of Vietnamese restaurant and this one is the best. Some others use lots of MSG for the noodle soup which make you thirsty for hours.< /Text>

<Review>A very tinnny bit more expensive than some of the other pho places around the immediate area, but well worth it! I love eating here because it is a really cute little place. The atmosphere and the quality of the food are what make it really worth going... I wouldn't get takeout from here (not that their take out is bad) just because there are cheaper options that are about the same in terms of food quality, but if you are planning in dining in a restaurant, I think this is the nicest place in the whole neighborhood! Get the fresh shrimp spring rolls for an appetizer, those are to die for!!!</Review>< Pics>

Compared to when the place was first opened. Quality has changed quite a bit from excellent to very mediocre. Nothing to write home about, very little for your money. Just an average bowl of pho.</Text>

If not, you gotta risk it and park on the street by the houses. This place gets packed but the service is fast. The pho comes in a giant bowl. Great for sharing. Their porkchop is also very good.<//Review>< pics>

The pho was good but really what the pho is wrong with the service they don’t come around to give more water I asked 3 times while I sat at the table the lady looked annoyed and walked away.    I had to get up to get water myself.    I give it 3 stars because the food is good.   The service sucks.</Review>

Service is subpar - has to repeatedly ask for an extra soup bowl, extra fork and spoon, etc., some attribute to communication, others to shortage of waiting staff, or just that folks are having a bad day. None of this however, would’ve explained why the soup would leave a greasy after taste and the ‘overly well done’ raw beef serving. Overall, the food is ok, depending on your taste (some people like greasy soup and overcooked beef) and the experience is ok, if you are used to the usual ask, wait and repeat your ask to the waiters type of service 😉< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants. Many come here for their many varieties of beef pho, but I prefer their bún (rice vermicelli noodle dishes) and com tâm (broken rice dishes). They offer some less common items,  like the nem nuong nha trang (pork sausage with a crispy eggroll wrapper cigarette,  and unusual meat dipping sauce), or the banh tam bi, with shredded pork and shredded pork skin, a savory coconut cream sauce to pour, and oil wilted scallions. Branch out and try ordering something new!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great local pho' place for a really reasonable price, everything is to my liking although I have never had their vermicelli. The only reason this place doesn't get a perfect score is because no matter what (beef) pho you order expect tendon, even if you ask specifically ask for it not to be in there.< /text>

Pho was delicious
The pork paste which turned out to be a ground pork patty along with grilled pork with salad and vermicelli noodles and some pickled vegetable and mint and perilla leaf was our fav

The chicken wings were ok. Could have been more flavorful or bigger but the nam chuc sauce that came with it was generous and fantastic.</text>

< Review>
Pho An San is better than any pho that I've had in San Francisco!

The broth screams flavor.  It's so flavorful in fact that I did not need to color my broth red and brown or ask for more lime.  That's a first!

Tip: The rare steak quality is superb!  To take advantage of this, order pho with the rare steak on the side.  They don't charge for this service (some places do *cough Pho 2000*) and you can prevent your beef from becoming overcooked.  However, note that the amount of beef you get is the same whether you order a large or regular.  Deceptive eh?</Review>

Updating review as of Jan 2020.  Ao Sen is till run by the same family/folks as it was +5 yrs ago.  Food quality/prep is still pretty much top notch. Def come here for their signature dishes that are hard to find elsewhere - the bun cha Ha Noi (grilled pork patties and slices marinated in a sweet salty sauce with mildly pickled mango and carrots done basically as good as you might find in north Vietnam), and the cha ca Thang Long - hot plate pieces of sweet white fish (large, juicy, moist, not at all over cooked) marinated with dill served with traditional sides (can't think of another Viet restaurant around that has this on their menu)!  Place can get noisy when it's packed, and maybe minor wait time if you come during peak lunch hours.

original review -
Great food, staff can be off with service given how busy they get, be ready to wait if you come during busy time.</text>

<review>This is probably the best Vietnamese restaurant in the east bay.  I tend to get the broken rice (com tam) but the various phos and bun bo hui is good too.

The place has gotten a lot busier recently and the service has slowed.  They do a poor job of serving everyone at the table at once.  If you order a soup, you may get it first and you're other table partners may get their food 10 minutes later, by which time your soup is either cold or you're done eating.</review>< pics>

This is hands down the best pho in the area! Flavorful, rich, complex broth topped with thin, delicious cuts of meat. I've tried Kevin's Noodle House, Phở Gá Hủỏng Quê, Pho King-all of them- and this place is the best!

Accepts cards if over $20.

< Review>
I had some doubts but when Chinese people visiting the bay area know about this place, it must be legit and they were right.
That pho broth doh.  so umami , rich, and delicious!  Having tried many pho in San Jose, their broth is just on another level.  It's that next level stuff.

Pho Ga (chicken) broth was okay, but their chicken totally makes up for it, it's full of flavor and just so soft.

Many people also said to pass on the large because you don't get much noodles.  For the regular size, they seriously do skimp on noodles.

Must try! Take it home and add some more noodles yourself!< /Review>

I've been coming to this place for years and always like their food. Their old location nearby Lake Merritt had more a homey feeling to it. Now the new location looks more like an overpriced Vietnamese restaurant. However, the quality of their food has remained consistent. Good choices are the beef pho, grilled pork vermicelli and the Hanoi vermicelli. Rice plates are good alternate choices. However they suffer from skimpy portion syndrome and you could end up going home hungry.
A big plus is I hardly suffer from dry mouth and headaches after eating at this place. My guess is there's less MSG in their food.
The dining area is clean for the most part. And tables are cleaned up right away after the customer leaves. Areas for improvement are the bathroom and parking lot areas.
Service quality for the most part is average and acceptable. Workers are fast and efficient. Sometimes young workers tend to get caught up in coversations with their own or their own smart phone. Warning: workers speak little or no English at all potentially screwing up your order.
My biggest pet peeve is workers, including the owner, NEVER say thank you. Did I say the owner. These include situations like leaving a good tip in front of THEIR face. I supposed this is a common experience in most Vietnamese restaurants. I wonder if there's even a word for thank you in Vietnamese.
A reminder if this is going to be your first visit: PAY AT THE CASHIER after you eat. There's no visible sign anywhere. And remember your table number. You don't want to pay for somebody else's bill.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The restaurant is newly remodeled. There is a parking lot right next to the restaurant so that is a plus. I think my friends over hyped the food. I got the big bowl of pho and it was ok. Not the best pho i've ever had, but it satisfied my pho craving. Maybe it was just an off day for them. I'll try it again when i go back. The spring rolls were great though, so that up the food points! Definitely get an order of spring rolls if you go there.< /Review>

Mediocre Pho, but the Vermicelli beef was super flavorful. Nicer atmosphere than most hole in the wall Vietnamese places in Oakland.<//review>

Overpriced. There are way better Pho places in Oakland and the price plus tip is less than here.</review>

I have never eaten such delicious beef udon after many business trips in Vietnam, udon soup is the best.

經常去越南出差、從未嘗過這樣出色的牛骨湯、要在美國才能喝到、太滿意了。
ベトナム出張何回いってもこんな美味しい牛肉うどん食べたことないんです、うどんのスープが最高です。<//review>
