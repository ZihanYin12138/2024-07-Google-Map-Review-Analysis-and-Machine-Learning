Got a tuna tartare, a spoon appetizer, a dozen oysters, and some sake. All beautifully presented and all delicious. . May have been a little busy or something but service was decent at best. But pretty lol 😂🤷🏾‍♀️</Review>< username>

Food: the sushi is sub par. Not overly diverse menu. Don’t go for the range of sushi options. The quality of the sushi ordered was adequate for the price charged. Right to left: spicy tuna, hickory, the dragon. Btw the chopsticks suck.

Atmosphere: it is rather loud so having conversation is not overly easy without having to constantly repeat yourself.

Service: is slow. The wait staff seems otherwise distracted. Getting water refilled is a challenge.< /review>

I ordered sushi gluten free and the owner working the floor let me know the sushi was made with vinegar and not safe to eat. He went to the neighboring vietnamese restaurant to get safe rice to accomodate my order. I was so impressed with the way they went above and beyond to accomodate my needs. The food was really good as was beverage selection available. I would definitely recommend this place especially because the owner is so invested in quality service!< /review><username>Candice Miller< /username>< time>

The vodka in the standard blush drink tasted a little cheap- it tastes much better if you get the $2 substitution for a better vodka. The waitress was very nice and offered to take the blush drink off the tab as my friend really disliked it and didnt drink it.</Text>

Nice being in San Pedro square and nice that you can bring some of the outside stuff in. Sushi is good...not great. Has a lot of the crab or non traditional stuff in it. Apps are pretty good. Service is nice and they have 3 TVs if you want to watch a game.<//review>

A friend and I ate here Sunday night. We both ended with food poisoning. I was unable to go to work for 2 days. I called to let them know, they said they would call back and never did. The cocktails are still good though.</Text>

The sushi is good here. We also had sake bombs and the ceviche. We really enjoyed our time. They don't have brunch and happy hour is really late, but would still do it again.< /Review>

<Text>Service has been very poor lately. I usually like to come here during happy hour or before a night out with friends but lately it hasn't even been worth the time spent or $$ from the lack of service. The bartenders have been awesome it's the servers at the tables that make the experience horrible.<//Text>< resp>

For a dining experience, I highly suggest you go during the week. On the weekends they play a lot of music and there can be quite the crowded. They also check ID's on Fridays and the weekends after a certain hour.<//Review>

<Review>My husband and I came here for lunch. The choice of background music is like 80’s hip hop. We both enjoyed it. The sushi was amazing. We had the Miso Butter roll, Lava roll, and the Gilroy roll. Our server was Brianna. She was very nice and attentive to our needs. I had a mojito slushy, she said it was her first time behind the bar, but I would not have noticed. It was really good! Next time we visit San Jose, this sushi place will be our first choice.<//Review>< Pictures>

My friend took me to the Public market and Blush Raw Bar. What a great choice ? The food was just the right type and size to accompany a drink or two. The waiter was very helpful and not to overbearing. I had a great time and this will be a spot I came back too while staying San Jose.< /Text>

I came to Blush on a Wednesday afternoon around 4:30 and was immediately greeted by both the server and the manager.  We were seated right away (the place was pretty empty).

Our server was very nice and informative -- she gave us tips on what customized drinks we could make based on our taste preferences.  My favorite was regular vodka, soda water, lemon lime slush with strawberry puree.

We had the following items from the HH menu:

- rose roll - delicious and large portions

- hamachi spoon - very fresh fish, but too much sauce.

- sushi tacos - large portion, but i wish they would make it so that it was easier to split with another person.  because each taco had different toppings, I did not get to try all three flavors.

- cheese fondue - the portion was on the small side.  there's too much bread for the amount of cheese provided.  I wish they had other dippers like vegetables instead of all bread.

- oysters - unfortunately, the oysters were bad.  they didn't taste particularly fresh and they were not cleaned (lots of shells and rocks in every bite).

I highly recommend coming here for happy hour, but do yourself a favor and skip the oysters!</review>

<Text>Blush has one of the best happy hours in town. The food is good and the drinks are even better. Although not the cheapeast happy hour the quality it's well worth it.

Blush at San Pedro Square is a great bar.  I love their sushi taco. Best value of course is during Happy Hour.</Review>

This place has improved big time from the last time I went. Happy hour deal is amazing! The Build your own blush- BYOB is so worth it for only $5, I can barely finish it. The drink is huge and they definitely did not go cheap on alcohol coz I feel more buzzed finishing that giant drink than an LC somewhere else lol.

Recommend food for happy hour: Rose roll.< /review>

Call first they may be closed,  they can't be bothered to post correct hours or serve paying customers at 10:40p when they close at 11:00p. To the owner : If you are going to close at 10:30p on Monday's then change your hours!  Don't make it up and lie to customers!</review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>I would really rate this place 3.5 stars.

What I like:
Great happy hour. They have $1 oysters (minimum of 6 though) cheap house wine and draft beers. I love this place during spring, summer, and beginning of fall when its nice and warm because I like sitting outside

The food is okay, you could definitely get wayyyy better sushi elsewhere.

This place is really for light snacks and heavy drinks. Great place for a social hour, not necessarily to wine and dine a special someone.

Still a cool spot with very nice and accomodating staff.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808fcca239a23525:0xd94b97e3b83d3cbd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Definitely a different experience when compared to the stereotypes Restaurants or Lounges.  This is kinda of a mix of the both world, where you get to eat comfort food in a Lounge like scenario.  More over, people are very friendly and the in my opinion the average age group is between 20s to early 30s.<//Text>

<userid>104265446396533455986< /userid><text>4 stars for the food, but 2 stars for the drinks. The drinks are for people who haven't put on their big boy/girl pants yet: candy-like flavors, and served like a slushie. We decided to try to get real drinks instead of alcoholic slurpees, and were rewarded with whiskey sours that used nasty-tasting sweet & sour mix and/or artificial lime flavor.

Liked the seared tuna "club sandwich" appetizer.< /text><Date>1460420354896<//Date><username>Tom O'Neill</username>< gmapID>

I indulged in their Happy Hour for the first time yesterday.  Fantastic!!!  Great prices, great food and great drinks.  I LOVE SUSHI and it is so hard to find Sushi restaurants with happy hour specials.  My brother introduced me to the Hamachi Spoons!  Yummy! I also had the California Roll, Tuna Roll, Poke and Mozzarella Caprese.  Everything tasted great and fresh. The BLUSHIE drinks are a MUST TRY. I had two Blushes and a Vanilla Sky.  Delicious!  The service was great and you will even see the owner walking around talking to customers and bringing out your dishes.< /Text>

Located in San Jose's new Public Market, Blush Raw Bar is part of an experiment in a new way to dine and socialize.  Tucked in the back corner, Blush has a high end feeling while still in the middle of all the fun of the Markets.  Went there to meet up with friends, have some drinks/apps and watch a Blues singer/band perform.  Starting with cocktails, I ordered the Blush Sangria "Blushie".  It seems to me to be a their take on an Aqui's Swirl (a local favorite) and only moderately successful.  Next were the small plates.  Coconut Tuna Tartare was good, feel like it was a little on the bland side but very fresh.  Carpaccio was good, I liked the presentation and flavor.  The Ahi Club was one of my favorite things, ahi tuna seared perfectly with an asian slaw in middle of parmesan crusted/grilled bread, served with wasabi aioli.  This is the one I'd order again!  The Cheese Fondue would go in the same category with the Ahi Club, yummy!  We ordered a dozen of their fresh oysters, they were very fresh but some of them were noticeabley smaller than the others.  Can't wait to go back and sample a bit more of their menu as well as the Market!<//text>

I wish I could give zero stars. We showed up 15 minutes early for our appointment and we’re told our tax preparer left for the day. My wife and I both took half days off work to be able to get this done. We did not receive a call  letting us know our appointment was cancelled.  They acted as if it wasn’t their fault and that we should just re schedule which is unacceptable. This location on Clay St in City Center has the the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced, and I have been getting my taxes done through H&R Block for close to twenty years. We own two houses and our tax Apointments usually run over an an hour. We were told we couldn’t reschedule because our tax preparer Denis Lynch could not accept Apointments over an hour and definitely not two hour. The older lady at the front, rude and uncaring, told us we can drop off our documents and they would do our taxes and call us when they were done. That’s laughable! Anyone who pays taxes in two different states and owns two houses in two different states needs to sit with the tax preparer and go through every document, or it will be done wrong. This place is a joke. I’m done with over priced preparer fees and I’m done with the terrible customer service for good. I know it doesn’t matter and Block doesn’t care but I’m hoping this will be seen by the right people and save them a terrible experience. Stay away from this place.<//text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Dennis Lynch has a very poor attitude and seemed burden by my visit. His responses to my questions between pauses and sighs felt awkward and unhelpful as I asked questions. After an hour's visit, he reminded me twice that he was ready to go home. H&R Block - please don't schedule 5pm appointments if your accountants will be annoyed by end of day customers. I sustained his poor attitude as long as I could before I mentioned that it seemed like I could do my taxes on my own for the level of service I was receiving. He proceeded to accuse me of suspicious behavior as I asked questions to understand what my deduction allowances are. All of my paperwork was in the system from the prior year and I brought with me all itemized deductions from my account registers. I decided to hire H&R Block for guidance and professionalism. Instead I received false accusations that my work was insufficient. This is insulting, unprofessional and has no basis in reality. Rude.</Text>< Pics>

In 2015, I had Fred Stevens prepare my taxes. Fred Stevens works in two offices, one at the City Center location, the other at Temescal (both in Oakland). It was the first time I’ve decided to use a professional service for my taxes. I’ve been doing my taxes via TurboTax for the past 10 years, never without a hiccup.

I decided to go to H&R block for my 2015 returns due to the complicated stock investments from my current employer. I figured, a professional will give me peace of mind. Boy was I wrong. It’s the exact opposite.

A few weeks ago, I received a letter from the IRS stating that my 2015 taxes were filed Incorrectly and that I now owe $8,885. I was completely shocked and appalled  given the fact that I knew that was the exact year I had Fred Stevens from H&R Block file my taxes.

I called back Fred Stevens with complete urgency. It took him a few days to call me back. I faxed over to him the necessary documents for him to “take a look at”. From there after 5 days of no response, I decided to track him down. He says “he was busy but needed more information”. So I faxed him again more documents… waited 5 more days of non response. Again I had to proactively track him down. This time he mentions, “It was his fault and he filed the taxes incorrectly but I would still have to pay the $8,885 to the IRS. Because I didn’t get the “Peace of Mind” Insurance Guarantee that H&R Block Offers”.

I don’t understand why I would have to spend extra money for “Peace of Mind” when these are professionals whom I initially went to for, Peace of Mind.

In the end, Fred Stevens said he will “try to make a claim” for me, but ultimately I don’t believe in his lies. Their website may say that Fred has 35+ Years of experience on there, but his professionalism is far from ideal. A true professional should be proactive in helping his clients. I feel that Fred is trying to avoid his mistakes. I have no faith in this company, nor would I ever have any faith in Fred.

Update.. it’s been day 3 since I last spoke to Fred and still no response or call back from him.

Please avoid this place at all costs.< /review>

<Review>My coworker and I came here with our Vaccine cards in hand, hearing that Staples was laminating them as a courtesy. Coming into the store you can’t help but feel a bit sad. The store, lighting and general feeling is tired, run down and burnt out. Frankly I’m not surprised after this past year I can understand why the employees didn’t seem particularly thrilled with being at work.

We made our way over to the faxing and print services where we were greeted by the lovely Val. Her sunny demeanor helped to brighten the space around us and she happily took our Vaccine cards to make copies of and laminate. We chatted while she worked and discussed our journeys to get an appointment for the Vaccine. Once she was finished we inquired about the custom stamps on display and she recommended we check out the website to see more options and varieties.

After making our way to the register we encountered Miles. Soft spoken and incredibly kind he took the time to help me fill out an application for their rewards card which saved me money on this transaction!

Val and Miles, thank you so much for your excellent customer service. We will be back especially because of you!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

It is a nice store. But if you do an online print document order and paid extra for express to get it done by 11am, don't expect the employee to alert you that your order is ready to pick up.</Text>

I did catch the employees name who helped me, but she was friendly and helpful. If she some how reads this...printing...up scaling black and white to color...people still need hugs.
It seems most people use COVID as an excuse to make other peoples day go south or to put someone else in a bad mood.
I’m telling you, it’s refreshing to walk into a place and have someone help you who seems like they actually want to help you, and to top it off, be friendly while helping you.
You want to know what that makes me think and want to believe? There is still hope for humanity.< /review>

Staff are very attentive and helpful. The place is organized well so easy to find any item in store, and online purchase pickup is pretty good as well. Prices are mostly cheaper than office depot or Amazon.< /Review>

<Text>My friends and I shopped frequently at this Staples to get materials for a supplies drive. Elizabeth and Brandon were very patient and helpful representatives, and several times they helped us find products in the store that were on sale or that we wanted to buy but could not find. Chris, the manager, was also very helpful to us and on one occasion where the weather was warm even distributed bottles of water to those of us in line.  If you're looking for good service and a wide range of office and school supplies, this is a great store.</Text><Date>1535056813789<//Date>< name>

The shop itself is not crowded with people which makes it pleasant to find the things you need without a constant crowd avoidance strategy in play. The only problem with that is that i hope they make enough to cover the rent :)
I do wish they would open the parking lot up between themselves and Home Depot as I would find myself going there a little more often if they did (I find myself driving to Home Depot and could do with going to Staples but getting from one shop to the other is a bit of a faff, so i dont.

<review>If your employees were very pleasant they tried to help as much as I could. But you don't offer the product that originally looking for. Avery Business cards. Or have them printed through your card center the way I want them printed. I was able to find the product online and ordered four boxes.<//review><rating>3< /rating>< name>

<text>I went into Staples to MacGyver some affordable business cards, but a friendly rep saw me and helped me find their printing center. It was easy and affordable.
I picked up 1000 cards for $20+tax.

I thought Staples was going out of business, but they've become kind of a boutique small business center. At least go to their website, they probably can help you.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808e34da3856bb47:0xdf2223b1de4d8f6d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

JAN 2018 updated review: while this store has always had slow cashiers at least they were never rude. That changed today with the cashier that "took care" of me.  I was bringing cartridges in to recycle. There is a limit based on whether you are a regular customer or a premier customer. She did not know which I was from my account information and was unwilling to figure it out. So rather than make two trips to return the cartridges that I had I would need to make four. She insisted so I asked for a manager who confirmed that I was a premier and allowed me to recycle the 20 that I wanted to. This lovely young lady then informed me after the manager left that "It's okay, you got your chirps in.". Yeah, after the manager left she disrespected me straight to my face. I will never again go into this store unless I'm desperate. Rating is changed to a one star from the original 3.   ORIGINAL REVIEW:I only stop in here when I absolutely cannot wait for a delivery.  The staff working the registers is super slow.  I always leave there more than a little frustrated.  Selection isn't so bad but they keep moving things around the store so it can be hard to find whatever it is you're looking for :/<//text>

When I come here to utilize the print department (and services) there's always a lonnng wait and it takes forever, and I hate it, but they do an excellent job and Stephanie is very knowledgeable and customer service oriented.
The prices are better than Office Max/Depot too!< /Text>

Called them in advance to check the inventory. Got a confirmation that that yes - they have that one item in stock. Asked them to reserve it under my name.
When I arrived in 30 min - I did not like place at all. It's hard to drive into the parking lot - only one entrance and it's fenced from nearby Home Depot parking lot.
When I walked in - I asked about the product and mentioned that called and reserved it.
Got a "I don't know what are you talking about" face in response.
Then talked to a manager on duty - she confirmed that they have that product in stock and disappeared in the back of the store with one of the CS guys.
About 10 minutes later that guy walked out and said that they don't have that product in stock. - "What????!!!"
When I asked to talk to a Manager - that guy disappeared.
After waiting for another 10 minutes - I called Stapes customer care and filed complaint. Lady on the phone put me on hold and called the store - then that guy walked out and stared to lie to me again that manager is trying to find me a product, blah-blah-blah.
In the end I waited for more than 30 min, but still was not able to talk to a store manager on duty.
Not sure what actually happened to that item I reserved. Whether they have issues with inventory system, or they just sold that product to someone and refused to acknowledge it.

My advice to everyone - don't call that store, don't buy from them - you will get a bad service, even if you will like to complain - you will not be able to talk to a manager, because he/she will hide in the back of the store.<//review>

<review>Very poor customer service. I waited at a register to check out while the associates where standing around talking. One associate saw me finally but then acted like it was a chore for him to ring me up. His name was Eric and he was very unpleasant. He even threw my chane down on the counter rather than handing it to me. I told him to have a good evening and he just rolled his eyes, and said whatever. I immediately returned my purchase, asked for a manager however he never came. I got my money back and left. I will not revisit this location ever again. The Staples in Fremont is more appreciative for my business.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

One of those places that spends all their time dealing with their internal processes and no time with customers. If someone has a return the entire staff seems to get consumed with sorting out the "right" way of handling it. If you're talking to someone and the phone rings get ready to wait - because phone calls are more important than you. Then after all these frustrations when you check out the hard sell on "insurance" kicks in, then the "Rewards Program" pitch.< /Text>

<user_name>Sean Hamamuratankersley</user_name><time>1460304797208<//time><rate>1</rate><review>Let me start out by say I lived a hard knocks life. I never had any one to trust or rely on. I started coming to staples and start up my own construction business. I’m collecting unemployment rite now because I have had a skin condition for 6 years and stress truly can kill someone, I was dying. So I’m trying to focus on my health. Try and use my money and time as wisely as possible. TOO REMINEND YOU ALL , THIS IS A POLITICOLY CORRECT STATE. So every complaint I’m saying I can and will sue staples for. There is a staples suck website for a reason and I’ll explain fully in how and why they do and how I should own staples. I have been coming in and out of the one in Campbell off Hamilton. I came in and went got a coin counting machine. I also plan on getting into the bar and club business, “sorry I like to have fun but not for how much it cost. I like to buy everyone rounds, and talk”. When I got home I plugged the unit in and it did not light up, I read a litlle up on it and pressed a couple of buttons, still nothing so I put maybe ten coins in the unit and it still did nothing I tried taking out the cleaner tray and that would not open I went back to the store a couple of days later and returned it the young white manager that just got out of high school and also has been picked on, I can see he has major insecurities. I’ll explain, he was looking up my receipt because the managers are the only ones that can, 5 minutes later he still could not find it. I already knew how smart the register clerk is and I basically told him that the kid behind him would be better at his job. Well I saw a bunch of smirk and grins so I knew he did not know  how to do his job at all. And that he lives a lie. That the car he drives was on a loan, when we went got the other unit on the shelf. He had that smirk again when I said I’m going to fire him if he don’t start managing it right. I REMEMBER BEING that young, He has his head so far stuck up his ass that he thinks he’s better and smarter then everyone because he knows how to abuse them mentally. And work for nothing to make him look good and also goes with the other white boy managers. I am just calling it as I see it, when it is all going on. They are working together like a pack of dogs. So they can grow together. That I say is racist they don’t know each other, only by color. I AM HALF WHITE AND ASAIN. I HAVE MORE WHITE FRIENDS THEN I DO ASAIN. I asked to plug it in and see if in before I leave again. TIME IS MONEY AND THEY ARE WAISTING MY TIME. I saw that this one also did not have a plastic bag covering it or even in the box. So then he tells me that its fine and good to go. So I said< /review>< pics>

I hired The Sewer Pros to scope the drains on a house as part of the home inspection process. They accommodated a short-notice appointment request, were friendly and professional, and quickly delivered a comprehensive report and video. I wouldn't hesitate to work with The Sewer Pros again and recommend them to others.</text>

I hired the SewerPros for a pre-purchase sewer drain inspection on recommendation from my real-estate agent. Pricing was competitive, they were able to be on-site within two days, and the online video report was provided the next day with clear and informative commentary from the inspector (Josh). PDF report was also included. No complaints whatsoever, I highly recommend their services.<//review>

Nate was on time and very professional. He answered our questions during and after the inspection, and provided a very clear and detailed report. This property required some further cleaning to get a complete and accurate inspection, and by the end we feel that we understood what needed to be done and why. All in all it was an easy and enjoyable experience, and we would work with SewerPros again anytime!< /text>< Pictures>

I was able to get an inspection setup at the last minute. Also, I loved the pricing. They were by far the most competitive contractor for this inspection. They arrived on time and performed a great inspection. The report was great also. Really happy with everything and will recommend them to all of my clients.<//text>

The SewerPros were recommended to us for sewer pipe inspection. We were booked on the next day and had the report ready soon after. The fee was reasonable and we are quite happy with the service.</Review>

Just had sewer pros out to scope sewer on a residential purchase. Called half an hour before and came right at the start of the inspection window. Very professional and understandable analysis and advice.<//Text>

<text>I am a REALTOR® and when we are in escrow, we need help fast for inspections. Sewer Pros were available quickly, on time, communicative, professional, and fairly priced. Would definitely use them again!< /text>< Pics>

I have used SewerPros for many years now and they always give very honest and relevant information. There are a lot of drain companies that will try to scare you with what they see. These guys are different and always give you the TRUTH about what they find. Good, bad or indifferent. Highly recommend!</Review>

Tech was polite, fast, and very professional. They communicated very well with the Buyers when they presented their Sewer Scope Report, answered questions professionally and honestly, and practiced CA state mandated social distancing guidelines for real estate. Would absolutely use this service again.</Review>

Nothing but positive feedback when dealing with SewerPros! I'm a local Realtor and do many sewer scopes on properties and SewerPros is always on time, professional and very knowledgeable. Josh is especially amazing and goes above and beyond to get the job done and make the client happy. Super easier to schedule service on their website and Jasmine is quick to follow up to get the appointment finalized. I wouldn't use or recommend anyone else< /Review>

<Review>I called around all morning to get pricing and they were the most affordable.  I booked them one day and they were here the next day doing a camera inspection of the main line.  They also did a hydrojet cleanse.  They were ontime, professional and did an awesome job.  Would highly recommend them.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Sewer pros are great! They are fast, reliable, and affordable. As a real estate professionals, My team and I insist that everyone of our clients utilize Sewer Pros' services. They have saved our clients thousands of dollars by revealing damages that were not discovered during a regular home inspection. If you haven't used Sewer Pros yet, you must give them a try!<//Text>

<Text>Originally had them come out to check out our lines when we were purchasing our home. Their report was informational and easy to follow. They even provided a video of their findings. They provided recommendations and were not pushy. After escrow closed had then cone out to perform a hydro blast. Easy to schedule amd work with my busy schedule. Came out did their work and everything seems great. I would definitely use this service again in the future.</Text>< user>

With the camera vision to what's going on the technician Cody was able to find and clear the line for good.  Cody was on-time, professional and problem-solving.  Well Done.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

As the buyer's agent, we had a sewer inspection done on an almost totally rebuilt home (torn down to studs and remodeled).  We were not expected to have any sewer problems since the pipes had been changed also. We were surprised that the inspection report showed a section of the sewer pipe was disconnected and forming a valley which is likely to cause clogs in the future. We requested the Seller to repair. Seller agreed. His contractor repaired. But when we did the re-inspection, the inspector said "no change" from the previous one. Seller refused to do further repair. Buyer stayed firm wanting seller to repair, and we could not move forward. I was able to reach Rick Coffman quickly to asked him to explain why such a situation might arise (repaired, but problem not really fixed).  He explained to me with such clarity that I could understand, and he suggested a way for us to move forward to get a third-party consultation. I gave his contact info to the listing agent and his seller, and it looks like we will get it resolved soon. This was a good learning experience for me as well, and once the problem is resolved, both seller and buyer will be happy!< /Review>

What a Church!  This community is on fire with the Holy Spirit!  The homilies are challenging, the confession lines are long, and the Adoration chapel is always open late.  This is a wonderful Catholic church, led by faithful shepherds.<//review>

<Text>After enjoying many tasty meals in the past year at the Holy Spirit Saturday brunch, I've been trying to make it back after a couple of months of missing out. So I was happy to find my way onto the 99 AC Transit bus that stops close to the church cafeteria and the sound of bells let  me know it was only 10 am. Arriving a little early is a good time to relax and enjoy being in an atmosphere of peace surrounding. The volunteers are always very friendly the times I've come for the communal meal and nobody has ever asked if I was Catholic or not, it seems they accept all.< /Text><time>1559499903984</time></record>

This church is beautiful ,people are very welcoming.I loved  the choirs .We came here today to visit our previous pastor father John Carillo.We missed him already. Just checking making sure he in good place and I knew that he is because  of  the large group of Filipino community present at this church will continue to visit  this church and father John whenever we have opportunity.We live in Alameda is not that far from us.<//text>

<Text>I am amazed at how well this church is run.  Everything they do is extremely well thought out and I have never been to another church that had this level of... thoughtfulness in everything the deliver during the mass.  High def projectors, higher end sound system, HD TVs and other technologies are integrated into the presentation in an unobtrusive and balanced way.  The crowd is also one of the most diverse I have seen with other parishes having a heavier lean towards a specific ethnic group, this one seems to carry a good mix of white, black, Asian and Indian.  The beginning of the mass always opens with welcoming visitors, and transitions into special sessions during mass for children in different age groups where they are led away in groups to get attention for the early part of the mass and return part way through.  In many ways, I feel the spirit and quality of the presentation here should be a model for other parishes but I recognize the uniqueness and culture that others may have on their own.  This one just resonates very well with me.<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I'm new in the community and am very devoted Catholic. I've been to this Church a couple of times.  Just wondering why the Deacon not the presiding Priest says what we call the "Sermon"  after the Homily. Is this allowed...Like the songs and very good spirit.<//Review>

{'time': 1467849710217, 'text': 'Julian,\n\nI apologize for the late response, as I just saw your post. Ordained Ministers, Priests and Deacons,  can give the Homily.  Occasionally a Lay person may give a "Reflection". Normally, the Priest or Deacon will introduce that person to the congregation.\n\nThanks for your comment, and please stop at the Gift Shop on a Sunday and we can talk about it more and I can introduce you to one of the Deacons and they will be able to give you additional information.\n\nRick Danko'}< /resp>

I was in town during Lent / Easter, and went to this Catholic Church.  It's very old, and very beautiful.  Built by the Portuguese immigrants and now heavily Philipino.  The priests are very, very friendly - especially Father Matt.

They have the usual mass services, but a lively community of supportive and wonderful folk.

Worth a visit if you are in town, or new to town and a Catholic.< /Text>

I love their mass at 5pm on Sundays. They have a childrens collection where they invite all children to come forward and bring their monetary offerings. In addition, they pray for the sick, welcome the new and have large projectors and flat screen Tvs where you can follow along in prayer and in song. Just as Jesus would want. Amen.<//text>

I go here for confirmation and I love it, everything is great. I like symmetrical objects so the asymmetrical shape of the church kinda bothers me but it's the mass that matters, and it is well done every time.<//review>

<Review>All of the masses I attend, usually at 11AM and sometimes at 12:30 PM masses are always asking you to give you their wallets. Literally. They are remodeling a church that is way above their budget and tell the people to donate so that God has a better view of them from heaven. They have an extreme focus to digitalize their church with unnecessary audio equipment. To be honest the audio in church was fine, although, the church did look pretty worn down, they decided to get some Kim Kardashian top rank furniture that looks like crap. They spent 100,000 dollars on a baptismal font. They aren't even wasting money, the people who attend church do.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>My son has lots of fun here and the instructors are really nice. The only thing is that place need some MAJOR repairs. The roof leaks on some of the fields and they do need to either heavily clean their turf or replace it. It's indoors and after class my son is covered in this black stuff. And this I've seen with all the other kids.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1612043431149, 'text': 'Thank Kevin for your feedback. We have addressed the roof leaks this week and will continue to do the necessary maintenance on the fields. That black residue is standard and it is coming from the anti microbial rubber fill that gives the field its softness. We are disinfecting the fields every single day, too. Our plan is to replace the turf in the next 15-20 months. Thank you so much for being a dedicated customer!'}< /Resp>

Great indoor soccer arena. Visited for a birthday party. Great vibe, cute birthday area. Kids had fun in the bounce house and running around. Small arcade but kids still enjoyed it.</review>

<Text>Staff and coaches are awesome!  We dropped in on a class yesterday and had such a blast watching our 3 year old son have SO MUCH FUN! We were impressed by how the coaches incorporated early childhood development skills into a fun 50 minutes of soccer.  Little Kickers rock and we are so grateful to have found you.Thank you Upland Arena for your annual membership to help us save money too❤️❤️!!!< /Text>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>We just found this place this summer. We live in Colorado during the year and in California in the summer.

I was looking for a place for my two daughters that both love soccer, one of which plays club in Colorado. We tried out the CB3 camp for both our girls. They LOVED it! The coaches were knowledgeable, and excellent with the kids. Their love of the game translated so well when teaching the kids to love it as well. They had such a good time, they also tried out the CB3 clinics and my 3.5 year old tried out Little Kickers. All the staff and coaches are fabulous and I highly recommend this place for everyone.

There are all kinds of players from beginners to more experienced. My son is a hockey player but wanted to go to the camp because my daughters loved it so much. He went, and although he isn’t a club player, he loved it as well and all my kids can’t wait until we return next summer so they can all attend the CB3 camps and clinics. Thank you Upland Sports Arena coaches, you were all AMAZING!< /Review>< Response>

<Review>A great facility for indoor soccer!  You can rent fields, and have a birthday party there also.  The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the party was a great success.  The kids had lots of fun, and the pizza was great.</Review>< rating>

I really like the sport s arena. When my son played which was a few years ago. The coach s had  spent a little extra time with the kids who was struggling in different. He was a people person and know how to deal with each kid different and believe me the kids even more confident.and success Ed and won the all-star game.</review>

<Review>I have two young children who enjoy playing in leagues here. We sign them up for classes to learn soccer skills. They also have a pretty decent bar and grill. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because one time my order of nachos was cold.</Review><user_id>115032590431210306661< /user_id><GmapID>0x80c3310ca09e1a77:0x51b54dba24527555< /GmapID><Date>1519933868630</Date></record>

<Text>Good facility, over priced and not a focus at all on the adult players. The facility knows that they have a product that is easy to sell, soccer, and they do. I am not sure they realize what a tiger they have by the tail and how much more they could do with the players that attend the facility. I am sure most of the players volunteer or coach in soccer organizations, meaning that they could provide feedback, build programs, and create a fantastic soccer venue. I understand businesses are in business to make money, just no harm in making profit not the only goal.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The staff is very knowledgeable and very good with children. The games are always exciting. The food is also very good, we usually go for the Supreme chicken nachos. The people working the food court have always gone out of their way to make sure we are happy.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I would not recommend lil kickers. My son has a processing disorder so while it may seem like he is ignoring someone its just that he doesn't process what you are saying. The coach treated my son like he was misbehaving and tried putting him in time out. I'm not going to pay for a coach that doesn't understand children to put my son in time out. She gave him no chances and treated him like all children are The same. She seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. I found a great place for him to play  that's cheaper, not in a smelly old building and the coach is amazing.</Review><Date>1542596278480</Date>< pictures>

I bring my children here for indoor soccer play. I really enjoy being indoors watching my kids play. Out of the rain in the winter and out of the sun in the summer. Staff is also friendly and beer is served. Giving this place 5 stars for sure.< /text>

I booked a party 2 months in advance and was not happy the day of the Celebration. We chose the restaurant area and while my party was going on they started setting up another event in my area. They said they had a corporate party that was going to take over the whole facility which I guess took priority over my sons Birthday Party. Over the phone they told me that they were just going to pass by with supplies for their setup. They also told me I could bring a piñata but then they said I couldn't because of another event going on.  I told them to at least give my guest more time on the field which they did but not after I had already shelled an additional $45 for another 30 minutes.  If you are planning to have party at the Upland Sports Arena make sure you get everything in writing because they will change those plans to fit their needs and anything you discuss in person or over the phone are empty promises. The only bright side was our host Kayla, she was really accomidating. I have been coming here for about a year and will continue to have my kids play but don't think I will have another party at this facility.< /Text>

Fun place to play indoor soccer. The staff is really friendly and the refs overall are pretty good. Just like anything there are some really bad calls but for the most part they control the games so it doesnt get out of hand with the fouls. Personally i find it a little expensive to play here but I also havent played in Los Angeles anywhere else. San Diego leagues were quite a bit cheaper but i have been told this is about the norm for up here. The fields could use some new turf in front of the goal areas as the oatches are not done very well and have a decent lip to them. As a goalie I notice it a lot when moving back and forth across the goal. Other than that its a good place to play and the players dont play cheap and try to injure you.</review>

It was a great place to play soccer and have fun. They have 5 fields, but when one is being used to train kids the politely ask us to move. It is inexpensive and legit.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>So I go there today to sign my 4 year old for soccer and I wanted to have her try out the first class on their 8 week program ( it would make no difference to them at all whatsoever)
And they said that she had to pay for the 8 weeks in full before attending and if she didn't like it "sorry but u loose ur
money"
I told him it didn't make much sense at all and I could pay for the class today and he was not willing to go for it at all
Then some younger lady got up and gave me another option of the similar classes for beginners but again their schedule looked good but most o the classes didn't have anyone signed up for it .... U wonder why....
Because we already have a pretty crazy schedule with the kids with art , gymnastics, music  and jj classes it was nearly impossible to accommodate the classes that were actually filled ( not that many at all)
He tells me he cannot make a decision and I asked who could
He said the owner could and that she wasn't nice at all and he was being a lot more patient then she would be.
WOW
I know that a place that does not have the urge to get new students like this one cannot be making any money and it makes sense why they seem so unhappy to be in business  : /
Wish then the best of luck cuz for sure they seem to need it
As for us I ended up calling ayso and I am signing both kids + 2 friends there ;)< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

They dont stay true to their original closing time. Me and some friends went at 6:30 and they were closed because they said they didn't wanna wait all the hours without customers. And she proceeded to blame us for not making a reservation. If they do this they should obviously say this in their closing time.<//Text>

<Review>Molly Maid of Playa Vista were amazing! Best service I have ever experienced. No need to look any further. I am moving out and they really helped me out to say the least. Everything is spotless and they were also great company as I was still packing. Bulce scheduled my appointment fast with no problem and everyone was extremely professional. Thanks again!< /Review>< pictures>

Jenny and Maria were so wonderful. They payed special attention to areas I was concerned with, and went above and beyond what I expected. I should have started scheduling regular cleanings a long time ago instead of trying to handle childcare and deep cleaning on my own.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><Review>The results didn’t match my expectations based on how professional the customer service representatives were on the phone.  I called a few times and spoke with different people and each of them was professional, courteous and very responsive.  The women who cleaned my vacant rental house (after it had been painted) were nice.  But it seems they rushed through and I was left to scrub an obvious sticky spot on the hardwood floors and wipe the dust off the fan-light.  They charge a 3 hour minimum but the cleaners were only there for two hours.  Surely they could’ve been more attentive given they had an additional hour left on the clock.  I would probably hire this company again for the peace of mind that I’m dealing with a licensed, bonded and insured professional company.  However, I would do a thorough walkthrough inspection BEFORE I let the cleaners leave.</Review>< Name>

<Text>Excellent service and results. I called for a move out cleaning and needed same day service. They were able to get people to my house within an hour and the apartment was spotless when they finished. The representative was really helpful and worked with me to get the service I needed in a very tight time frame.

< Review>
After a kitchen remodel and our previous house cleaner of 10+ years  getting out of the business, we were in dire need of help. I did my search with some neighbors, friends and through Yelp. Main issue... everyone was CRAZY expensive. Getting quoted an exorbitant amount of money for our not-so-big place in SF was making me angry. So I did a yelp search and requested a quote for another service and went through the Yelp wizard to extended requests to others to compare. That's when Alves House Cleaning came up. It was obviously a new service with not so many reviews, but I took leap of faith.< /Review>

Molly Maid's from Playa Vista/ Culver City - they are the best.  The ladies show up.  They clean.  They work hard.  No complaints.  Always super pleasant.  And the house looks great.  The front office helps you and are always professional.< /review>

< Review>
I should have looked at the reviews before booking with this scam of an organization. The Molly Maids representative quoted me $95/hour for a minimum of two hours for my 2 bedroom, one bath, and one kitchen apartment. I agreed and took time off of work to meet with the housekeepers and let them in, etc. Instead, I spent the remainder of my afternoon with a nightmare. The 2 housekeepers spent 1.5 hours in our extremely small bathroom (yet there was still hair in the tub and in the corners). They then spent the remainder of my contracted 2 hours wiping down the top of my refrigerator, cleaning a microwave, wiping down my glasses, and doing a peripheral wipe down of our vinyl floors. They never once plugged in a vacuum or even entered my bedrooms. Dusting? You must be joking. Who would expect their place to be vacuumed or dusted if they are spending $195 to have their small apartment cleaned. To top it off, I had to ask them to wipe down my tables before they left 10 minutes early. This story ends with a phone call with their owner who accused me of making these facts up and offered me a 20% refund. A 20% refund despite my place not being cleaned? What a joke! Save yourself the $ and clean yourself. I wish I did.</Review>

<review>Irene and her coworkers are excellent in taking care of my new home.  Twice a month they clean my 5 bedroom house with the occasional one-off requests (like sweep the deck).  Absolutely a great addition to keeping my life simple.< /review>< user_id>

**This review is for the management not for the cleaning service**

We were customers for 6 months with Molly Maid. The cleaning service we received from one particular crew (Yani and Maria) was absolutely exceptional. They consistently did an amazing job, however, we had to cancel our service due to poor management and customer service. The office managers who field phone calls, relay messages, and set up the appointments are very unprofessional to the point we had to cancel our contract.</text>

My same team has been cleaning my home for more than 8 years now.  They always do a great thorough job and are very consistent from week to week.  They even check with me if they see something different or out of place between visits.  The floors and carpets are always especially clean (and I have had dogs so i know they put in extra effort there).  Lisa, the owner, always tries to accommodate special requests also if I’m traveling or have a special event in my home.  I have also started using them in my boyfirend’s house because they have been so great.  Thanks Molly Maids!</Text>

As a real estate agent working in probates regularly, I use this type of service regularly, my first time with Molly Maid of Playa Vista. They were perfect for me to use on behalf of my client. They were on time, texted me on arrival, used the lock box, texted me on completion, returned the key, and did the job they were supposed to at a high level. They are my new go-to for move-in or move-out cleaning services.<//text>

I inquired online about there service and received a call over the weekend. Awesome that you’re responsive to inquiries like that.

However, $95 per hour, with a two hour minimum to clean a 700sqft apt with two people is ridiculous. A $180 cleaning is not needed. They would be done after 45 minutes at the longest. Additionally, they wouldn’t quote a rate for biweekly service until they have completed their first service.

Working in the hotel industry, I’ve managed housekeeping teams for 15 years.  This is poor management/business practices.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Love the girls that come. They do a nice job. And they're very honest which is important. Something broke by accident and they immediately told me (it was no big deal). If I want extra attention to something they're right on it. Thanks Molly Maids!</Text>< pictures>

These people are thieves! The maids went thorough our financial information and stole our credit card number and charged it! When we called the office to report it, they could care less.

<Text>They showed up on time, send the two maids for four hours like we agreed and we paid them $320 for four hours. Kind of expensive but they did as they promised. We were present to oversee all of their work so perhaps that is why we were satisfied and we would use them again under those circumstances.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I'm not from around the area so when i started hearing noises coming from under my car, it freaked me out.  Thankfully i pulled over next to this shop.  The shop was closed for the day already, but I'm so grateful Tony decided to check on my car anyway.  He was able to show and explain to me what had happened.  Tony didn't try to sell anything extra to me. Again thank you so much.  Please do try this shop, you won't be disappointed.<//Review>

Been my mechanic for almost 10 years, very professional. Tony knows what he's doing, talking about and has reasonable prices. Honest and always gives service with a smile. I've recommended him to everyone I know, now recommending to individuals I don't know. You will definently be satisfied with ANY/ALL work done to your car.<//text>

Recently came to this shop to get a tune up and oil change.  When I came back to get my car, they did not have a list of other things I needed to fix (like most places do).  They completed the job I came in for and the price was reasonable.  I will definitely be coming back here for all my other services.< /Review>

<text>Thank god for this autoshop.  Very honest and 5 start customer service.  In and out of the shop in a timely manner.  Tony does a very professional job and quoted me with very reasonable rates.  He told me exactly what I needed.  I was given all these jobs that needed to be fixed by another shop and took it to this shop for a 2nd opinion and Tony told me exactly what I needed and didnt need!!

Take your car to this shop.  You will not be disappointed!!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Went to get an oil change while I was there I had them do a  brake inspection cause other shop I was going to told me i needed brakes they were shot and I was gonna have to replace all of them and it was costly. Anyway they did the brake inspection and told me I needed front brake pads and they would resurface my disks for a fraction of the cost the other shop told me these guys are great excellent service and prices I'm gonna tell all my family and friends about this place.</Text>< pics>

<Review>My family members love this place, but I just found it so-so. I'm vegan, and I found their available options to be pretty limited. When I allowed the chef to just come up with something, I thought the results were just okay, but not great.

Aside from the food options, the space itself is huge, which makes it quite noisy. I was here with a group of about 8 people, and it was very difficult to hear even the people directly across the table. For me, I felt like I spent more effort trying to enjoy myself than actually enjoying myself.

This is probably a better location for people with kids, or perhaps if you can get a little nook hidden in a corner somewhere.

Bottom line: Food was okay, atmosphere was okay. Service was okay. Nothing horrible. Nothing great.< /Review>< Pics>

Great place to go for a Sunday brunch or a Saturday lunch. Sometimes it's a little crowded but it's a really big place so you'll usually get seated quickly. They have a neat little bar you can sit at if you want to but I suggest a table. It's right across from some construction but when the construction is done there's going to be a really cool park right outside so it will have that going for it<//Text>

You can spend a solid 100 dollars on a meal for two (if you order 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 3 drinks and a French press and dessert to share at the end) and it's worth every single penny. Get the Mary's chicken. Good American food</review>

Hidden gem of Sonoma County.  Well run restaurant that has little staff turnover.  Might mean little on the surface, but this allows for a consistently great meal only ever outdone by the friendly and ever attentive staff. Great wine and beer selection run by one of the 2 best bartenders in our area.< /Review>

<Text>We found this place through Yelp and went there to check it out. It was on a Wednesday night and there was a street fair next to it, so it was bit more difficult to park. The restaurant was very busy, but they were still able to serve us without delay. The menu has plenty of options and we ended up both having a risotto. It was very delicious. The best thing of this restaurant is the cost-benefit. Our final bill was around $70 (no alcohol) and we had a wonderful dinner. Very cheap compared to most places in the wine country.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Great meal; great service!  We held the rehearsal dinner for our son's wedding at Flavor last weekend.  They were prepared for 26 at the meal - but 38 showed up!  The staff accommodated us on a busy Saturday night without drama or complaint.

All the attendees were happy with their meals and the staff was able to handle the load with minimal disruption.

We are happy to report great food and great service for a very large party.  We have been to Flavor Bistro several times previously, and we have always enjoyed our meals and the great menu.  Lots of variety - there is something for everybody on their menu.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>Very pleasant atmosphere if you sit in the front near the patio; otherwise the restaurant is so loud you can't hear your table companions.The food was very disappointing; we waited 45 minutes and when we inquired, the dishes were promptly brought to the table, leading us to think they had been sitting around. The lamb chops - ordered rare - were overcooked and c old. The solar and shrimp was tasty but also cold. We shared an apple tart that was all over kneaded, tough pastry w/little apple. We have been to Flavors many times and the eggplant park is, to us, the best dish (if a bit too tomatoey. This is definitely not the place for foodies but it's relaxed and, as noted, extremely pleasant if you're seated upfront.<//Text>< Pictures>

I want to adore this place, but the food's inconsistency will not allow me.
Now, the atmosphere is fine, though it can get loud.
The hospitality is well above average and worth the visit.
They have the best wine program in Santa Rosa when you factor in value, selection and amount of choices, second in the county to LDV!
They are open late and a fine place for a half glass of wine and a bit after work anytime.</Review>

I loved the food that my girlfriend and I got. The only service issue we encountered was coming during slow hours and so when we were readu to get the check, the waitress was nowhere to be found. We waited for a long time until I asked the server to make sure the server brings out check.

Ending on a positive note, it was raining outside and we were sat next to the fireplacr which was a lovely experience.</text>

< review>
When we first walked in I felt that I had walked into a café in Paris.  The first impression was appealing, the music and the décor spoke French.  Then it took a wrong turn.  We were seated alongside a table of a very large group (there was just two of us) and they were quite loud and rambunctious.  Then we were given the menu and it wasn’t French inspired at all.   It all seemed confusing as I thought the description said it was French cuisine.  As we ordered our food and hoped for the best, it just continued to be an unfortunate experience. Both our meals were not prepared well at all.  The food was plated well and looked like it would be very tasty.   After taking a couple of bites, we discovered that neither of our selections were good, we left the rest on the plate.  I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am aware, that this is a favorite for many of their loyal customers as they were quite busy.  However, for me, I couldn’t understand why.</review>

Decent Italian food, with a few odd options such as spicy tofu and Singapore noodles. Eggplant parm was good, but only had two slices of unbreaded eggplant.< /review>

<date>1462746890903</date><rate>3</rate><review>Absolutely fine, nothing to write home about.

I found most of the food to be very one-dimensional, lacking the depth of flavor that takes food from okay to great. I had a caesar salad that lacked any rich, meaty anchovy flavor. The salad was small, despite being the "regular" size between small and large. I also had the pescatore, spaghetti with calamari, scallops, mussels, and shrimp. The sauce could have used more flavor, be it garlic, pepper, or literally anything. It was quite thin and tasted solely of tomato. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente, however, and the scallops were not a second overcooked. The shrimp was well flavored - I wish some of that had translated to the rest of the dish! The pasta could have used more seafood as well. While the mussels were plentiful, the shrimp, calamari, and scallop felt a bit stingy.

Overall, nothing special. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I'd come back with so many great places to eat in Wine Country.</review>< Pics>

Ehhh...been here a few times. Really nothing to rave about. The burgers are down right gross, the Singapore noodles are pretty good, salads are probably the most consistent item on the menu. I do like their Huevos Rancheros. Wine pours are ridiculously small. That about covers it.</review>

The iced coffee is normally good. Today it was like drinking straight creamer. It was so sweet I couldn’t drink it. Normally this location is good but the last few times I have come here I have been disappointed. Will most likely start going somewhere else.< /text>< pics>

I really didn't want to go into details, because I have decided NEVER to go again. My sister and I walked in to order to go.  Big mistake. We watched ad the person who took my order and money went back to prepare our food without washing his hands touching our tacos (cold, hard) my sister kept me from saying anything. I could not eat my food. Will not go back. Maybe no more fast food.</review>

<review>This Jack in the Box on mission gorge is terrible. I advise not to go there. I ordered two jumbo jacks and two fries and one drink. Waited in line an extremely long time. They gave me only one order of fries and one jumbo jack. I had to go back and ask for my food that I paid for. Terrible service. This is a big inconvenience when your order is not given to you. They had a bad attitude. No manners apology. They need better training.</review>< Pictures>

This place doesn't care for the well being of its customers. The cashier the same person who handles cash is the same person serving fries, drinks and opening paper bags. Ofcourse she has gloves she's protected but what about customers ? We're in the middle of a pandemic where is the common sense.</Text>

Order was placed in the first quarter of 7am and was not ready when arrived for pick up at 7:30 till 7:50am and they forgot to add an item. Had to go back for it and the cashier had the nerve to say I forgot the item. REALLY! You are putting the order together. Started handing it to me. When I arrived back the cashier was putting the missed item together after I arrived the second time.<//Review>

It's a bit above average. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I  could. They have one of the better variety of items compared to most fast food and they usually have OK deals going on. It won't blow you away but it's solid for what it is.< /Text>

< review>
This is the worst jack in the box I have ever been to. I have visted this location on multiple occasions over the past 2.5 years and I don’t recall ever having a positive experience. The workers are very rude and very lazy. My orders are almost always incorrect and the food is always cold, never fresh. I will no longer be visiting this location.
(Also the workers are not wearing masks during the COVID mandatory mask order!)</review>

I like this Jack in the Box. Personally I feel they take my order correctly more often than not.

I'm rating 4 stars because the drive thru exit location can be frustrating. And I haven't been inside to see what it looks like.<//review>

I go here a lot, my wife is obsessed with the tacos (so am I). I usually go late at night, and there is a gentleman who is usually there who goes above and beyond, great dude. However, sometimes there are some women there who have pretty crumby attitudes (they might've been having a bad day, I don't know, but that shouldn't affect your work ethic), and neglect the most simple requests. She asked if I wanted sauce, i replied "ranch and taco sauce, please", she then scoffed and didn't put any in (i didn't realize there were no sauces until i got home). Either way, it's jack in the box, so it's whatever. Good luck reading all that 😅<//Text>

Jack in the Box is awesome you don't feel like you're rushed into your order and even though they get the same pay as McDonald's because I just reviewed them just a minute ago for the a little breakfast sausage or breakfast bacon I have not tried breakfast at Jack In The Box in quite a while so I'm sure it was good I think a breakfast burrito oh yeah that was good. I would suggest these for breakfast biscuit with sausage would be a Chick-fil-A number 1 number two Carl's jr. Number three Jack in the Box breakfast burrito as I remember was good. This review that I gave McDonald's a little while back was because $8 for the freaking breakfast breeder piss me off it was just like this they had how many years to figure this out and when it still tastes like not the best thing in the world but I can eat anything but I'm still kind of disappointed cuz because I've been going to them for freaking over 40 years they have had plenty of time to Perfect food,.<//review>

Unfortunately I was so hungry I took a bite of this burger before taking a pic. This was the most beautiful and well-crafted burger I've ever seen. It was perfection. It tasted great as well. I really wish I would have gotten the name of the person who put the burger together..< /text>

My card declined Kuz I spend my daily limit and the employee took his own card out to pay for it.   He said “merry Christmas”.   I’m trying to find out his name so I can drop a Christmas present to him😊. God bless this man and his heart of gold.  💛< /review>

I like their chicken teriyaki bowl and it comes with 1 egg roll. Now if you've never had an egg roll from JitB, well its impressive. They cook them from order so they're never sitting underneath a heatlamp and usually too hot to bite into right away. Today we had to pull off to the side and wait just a little bit because for or order. Wooorth it.</Review>

For some reason I always hit a traffic jam whenever I use the drive thru. Doesn't matter the time. Don't expect a quick drive thru experience like chick fil a or even taco bell in the area. It's really easy to get to and from the 15 freeway so I guess that's what makes it popular.</review>

I love Jack in the Box as the go to late night food but this place has messed up my order at least 3-4 times. Once I ordered a burger with no meat at all and ended up with a burger that had bacon. The service itself is usually nice but sometimes the order can get messed up but they do help fix the order any way they can.< /review>

I was with a friend who doesn't frequent JiB but he tried one of the burgers and he was shocked how good it was. I have been telling him that I thought they had good burgers compared to their primary competition.<//Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>I have been coming to this Jack in the Box for the last 5 years or so and all of the staff are pleasant and hard working.  What is Marcela, Pancho, Nicole and the Manager Norma...they're great people...the problem there is that there is such great turnover of employees that at times it undermines the effort that they do to make the Customer happy....maybe because the owner of the Jack in the Box doesnt provide good benefits and so anyone that has potential to make that particular JIB a steller performing store. ...but i guess no one really cares about the employees.....so people leave....<//review>< Gmap_id>

Jack is usually my pick among local fast food. This one declined to honor a BOGO e-coupon I received on my smartphone from corporate Jack, saying I'd have to print it out. On National Cheeseburger Day, seems pretty lame.</Text>

<review>Either the owner, district manager, or corporate manager needs to make a visit during the late shift to witness how  unwelcoming and horrible the service is here.  Each time i have visited this location during the late shift I have experienced horrible service. I went through the 24-hour drive thru and had to wait nearly 5 minutes before someone finally took my order. The lady that took my order clearly had an attitude and if anyone should have an attitude that night it should have been me! For having to wait so long before I could get my order taken. Then when I get to the window I had to repeat my order because she had gotten my order wrong and all I asked for was an Ultimate Cheeseburger on sourdough bread with only EZ mustard. No fries or a drink. How complicated is that?? On top of that, some fat Asian kid at the window ALSO had an attitude! Here's a word of advice: If you don't like your job QUIT AND FIND ANOTHER ONE. Let's get it together Jack in the Crack!</review>< Pics>

<Review>I ordered a 4 piece chicken strip for $5.19 and they were the size of my 12 year old son pinky finger.  Not Good!  And to add insult to injury, I went imto the mens restroom and the air dryer to dry your hamds didn't work and they didn't have any paper towels.  The bathroom stinks as well.  I shared this with an employee at the cash register and he looked at me as if I had dog poop on my face.   So my son and I walked away and will never ever go back to a Jack In The Box!</Review></record></dataset><record>
