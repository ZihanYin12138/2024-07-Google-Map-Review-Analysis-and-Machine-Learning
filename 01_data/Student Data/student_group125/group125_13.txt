My best friend came over to see me from OC and we had late lunch here. The food was amazing, fresh, and yummy! Thanks to Susan. She was very caring and checking on us on time if we need anything. We absolutely enjoyed our food and had a great time. Thanks for your kindness with the beautiful smile!< /text>

<Review>For starters you get chips, beans, and red and green salsa.  Soooo good.

Chili Relleno was good but the flour torts were undercooked. So consistency and quality control need more emphasis.

But I will be back to give it another shot because the food is that good.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCzDlVLwh6Cr6AiN5kuC_cbmvrLUndj34Gx3DH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d760cb5b2aadfd:0xbca44f273e5f3703</GmapID></record>

One of my top locations for quality Mexican food. Came in on a Weds. Next time I'll be back with my relatives. The place has a cool atmosphere. Reminds me of a place in New York I liked to visit.<//Text>

Great Sea Food!
Chips with beans and salsa are some of the best in town.  Wish they would clean the shrimp though.< /Text>

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT. While I was taking in the art and ambience, I heard a patron ask their server about the regular menu. I didn't think much of the comment until I returned to my table and saw the menu. My travel companion and I were looking forward to tasting some of the seafood and other offerings that we found on a menu posted online when we searched for the restaurants near us.

Needless to say (see the photo of the new menu) the new owners are not offering the variety and tastes most Mexican restaurants provide. If we had wanted something like that, we would have gone to any number of chain fast food "Mexican" style restaurants in the area.

As I do not live in the area (I was visiting for an event), I have no stake in frequenting this place, but if I were in the area again, I would suggest updating the menu to accommodate the many who at one time quite enjoyed the food, drinks and music of the prior owners.

If you like Mexican fast food this might work for you, but I don't think it is a good choice, considering there are other better places - little more, but the food and service are good, too.<//review>

Chili Verde is Pork in a green chili sauce and is an excellent choice. Rice is delicious and has the right texture and moisture. The beans are bursting with flavor. The flour tortillas are hand made in the restaurant. The service is great. They also bring chips with beans to your table. They don't charge for seconds which is great too. They don't penny pinch the customer. You will enjoy this place.< /text>

The food is good, friendly people. I gave it a 3 stars. My wife and I had the chilaquiles plate, and the salsa for the chilaquiles tasted like salsa del monte which is very common for Enchiladas. If the salsa would've been homemade, i gave it 5 stars.<//review>

The food was great today for lunch.  I had carnitas tacos that were great, made with freshly made tortillas.  So good.  My husband had the barbacoa plate which he loved, also with fresh tortillas.  Refried beans are really good too.  Been in Colorado for a while and it's nice to get back to really good Mexican food.</review>

<review>Stopped by on our way home to Az. I loved the food, prices were what was expected. And the waitress was awesome, patient and friendly. Thank you Jezel.
My only complaint is that a party was going on while we were there and the music was SO loud I couldn't hear myself think. My daughter was even getting a lil nervous from it. But in all it was good eats< /review>< username>

Food was really good and brought to the table fairly quickly. Restaurant was clean. My server was very polite and attentive to my table. The prices were very reasonable. This is a very good place to go eat.</text>

<Review>Went there for dinner, 4 adults, they start with a bowl the size of a small soup bowl with chips, the pico looks n smells spoiled, carne asada tacos were burnt, meat almost black, Chile relleno, so salty you couldn’t eat it, when we complained we were told that the cook said it wasn’t salty, how did she/he know? Never tasted it! The sope was so hard you couldn’t eat it, ordered a chicken taco, got a beef burrito, never going back!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d760cb5b2aadfd:0xbca44f273e5f3703</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Co-workers and I came to Guadalajara’s due to their 4.2 stars. Let me tell you! I ordered the carnitas plate which was dry and hard, not to mention the tortillas, those also seemed to as if they had them in the fridge for quite some time. To top it off the waiter was nowhere to be found so I had to get up from the table to request refills.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>It was awful. We were the first people to  there and it took forever to get our food I asked for ground beef it was shredded beef didn't have time to exchange it because we were in a hurry the meat was tough and there was no flavor to the food it was very bland definitely not coming here again  and when I let her know that I didn't like the food it was like it was no big deal didn't try to make it right at all I had two tacos and a tostada rice and beans I barely ate one taco.< /Text>< pics>

Horrible place come, if you like to wait for your food for a very long time please come.  One particular waitress who looked as if a career change is in her near future. We calld in a day before to make a reservations for 20 ppl and we waited an hour and half to get our drinks. Only 1 waitress was appointed to our party AND the surrounding tables around us who weren't in our party. We were there for 3 hours and gave up and not everyone got there food.
2 other parties got up and walked out after constantly asking for service..
NO way would we ever come back! !< /text>

My wife and I went to Guadalajara's restaurant  for breakfast, we ordered​ menudo, waw is the worst menudo we have ever eaten, tortillas seemed old, onion smelled funky and the service was the worst too, we will never go back for breakfast.</Text>

Called was asked to hold... and was left on hold for almost 20 min. I drove there and no one was even trying to answer the phone. Doesn't seem like they really appreciate the customer.< /Review>

I bought a Medium pepperoni Pizza, 18 chicken wings and a 8 oz pepsi total was $44.00 pickup. Ive could've gotten a steak dinner for that price. I think I will no longer order there. Ive been ordering there for 20 years. Im done. No more.</text>

<text>Pizza was OK but you can tell they forgot to add toppings and added them after it was baked & didn't stick on.  so when we opened the box the toppings were everywhere except the pizza. It was carry out. When we reached the window the supervisor took a long time to come to the window.   For the 1st ever though I got the sauce for the breadsticks without asking for them.  No pepper or cheese given.  Been coming here for 22 yrs & i noticed Pizza hut has gotten down over the years.  Disappointing since their pizza is my favorite pizza< /text><Gmap_id>0x80db1d2c3a4fb82d:0xf76894ca09707d2a</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Horrible!! I ordered for delivery twice. First was my boyfriend then after an hr I did after another hour I call and they tell me that they came and call and no answer BOTH TIMES 😠😠😠😤 All they had to do is go to the door, we have been here for hours starving for nothing. And not only did they lie they got the nerve to tell me to pick it up after 2 1/2 hours. I was a good customer with them but after that. Never again not from this one!!!<//Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< username>

<text>Placed an online order for delivery, but had to call in to add an item unavailable on the website. Patricia answered to assist and was very polite. She took care of my request quickly and made sure I didn't need anything else before we hung up. My order arrived complete and hot. Can't seem to get this service and accuracy at some of the locations closer to home in Orange County.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<review>Paid 80 bucks for two large pizzas and wings which I guess is the average now to get that delivered including tips, but waited an hour and 30 minutes to get my order, called the store about the issue they apologized and explained they were short staffed and that’s it. Dominos from now on.< /review>< Pics>

I have always loved Pizza Hut pizza, but this particular restaurant gets a kudos and five stars from me. I had ordered for takeout and while it was cooking, I walked over to the store. I got to the cashier and realized I didn't have my wallet. I had left it on the counter at Pizza Hut! My girlfriend called the restaurant and was reassured that the cashier had seen it there and put it up. All the money I had was in there, I am very thankful to Stella 029205, she had my wallet safe until I returned. Thank you again STELLA. 🤗🤗</review>

Always inconsistent. Tonight I ordered a large super supreme cooked extra long for crispy crust and I got a barely cooked crust with dough practically raw on the top. We ordered blue cheese for the wings and got ranch.  I tried 3 times to order with my nearly 400 points and it wouldn’t go through - as soon as i order with no points it goes through. This has happened so many times I am officially done with this location and that means with Pizza Hut - too bad - very poor location<//Review>

Easy online ordering! Staff friendly. Pizza usually right on time if not a few minutes wait. The Date Palm Pizza Hut has drive thru pick up that's very convenient.  Only thing is food is usually too over done.< /Review>

< Review>
Tried the Pizzone's,. What can I say. Loved them when Pizza Hut had them 3 years ago   They are back again so I decided to go with them again.  What a disappointment. They were paper thin, one flat row of meats and cheese, about 1/8 inch thick.  Much smaller in size then 3 years ago.  Not worth the price of 6.99 each.   Shame on you Pizza Hut.  I haven't been to Pizza hut in 3 years, and after this, probably won't ever go back again.< /Review>

Used to love Pizza Hut..... But they no longer have the pretzel crust option. I really got spoiled to it and loved it! The regular options available now feel like it's missing something 😯😯 Just isn't the same anymore.< /Text>

Ordered online and used Verified by Visa to pay. Was still asked to see the card when I got there. Just happened to have that card with me,. Had I not, I guess I wouldn't have gotten my pizza. When I picked up the box (large 2 topping) I knew it wouldn't be good. It hardly weighed anything. Got home and I was right. Hand tossed crust was way thin, barely any sauce, light cheese and the toppings were sparse. Won't be going back.</text>

I was called stupid and treated badly when I was dinning in the restaurant and asked for packages of pepper, a man named Edward asked me what was wrong with the ones at the table?
When I said I just wanted to pay extra for packages so I know nothing was wrong with them he called me stupid and said it was for carryout people only. At first I thought he was just joking but he was serious and treated me rude after I then asked how can I buy them from you so me and my daughter can enjoy the pizza.
He threw them at me and then finally finished checking me out, he was extremely difficult and rude, I did not appreciate having to be called stupid in front of my daughter and treated like that.
I have never had a problem at any pizza hut until this and I would never go back to this one, that pepper packages are for paying customers not just carryout and him calling me stupid several times really upset me but I had my daughter with me and had to hold myself together.... It was hard.</text>

This pizza hut has rude employees because they argue and yell at customers when an innocent customer says, "Hey my pizza is burnt!" The manager yells/argues back saying it's not burnt< /Review>

Apparently the person taking phone orders is not up on what is or is not available. It wasn't until I got to the counter to pick up my order that I was told they did NOT have hand tossed pizza dough. Needless to say that meant they my hadn't even started my pizza. A phone call back to me from someone letting me know that would have been nice. Then to make this experience even nicer the wings were not started until the pizza was out of the oven. Yes my pizza is cold and no I will not be going back to the Cathedral City Pizza Hut.<//Text>< pictures>

I ordered 2 medium pizzas .  I asked for a pan pizza on both and on one I asked for mushrooms and sausage .They put sausage and onions and the crust was as thin as a cracker. The 2nd one the topping was right but it also was thin as a cracker when I asked for a pan crust . So I was very disapointed when normally I love pizza hut<//text>

<review>I went there not so long ago and everything was okay until they took my order. They we're really friendly, but they wasted so much of my time. I ordered a small size meal (16 hot wings). They took forever to bring my drinks, aprx 20 mins, and another 40 mins to get my hotwings to the table. To think of the time they spend "preparing the food", you would think that the food would be good quality, but unsurprisingly, it wasn't. I was very upset for the time wasted and the quality of the food. I would not recommend going to that pizza hut.</review>< pics>

My on-line order was cancelled because they only had thin crust. When I arrived I reordered and told it would be 15 min. My pizza was assembled in 15 min. They failed to start cooking my brownies until after my pizza was ready (30 min so far). My order cost $5 more than the on-line quote and it took 45 min longer.<//review>

Overall I was pleased with what I received. The service was extremely friendly, the food was clean and not heavy with oils. The spice was perfect! The only thing I didn't like was my dish had tofu and it didn't specify it on the menu. The dish tasted amazing, just took out the tofu. Definitely planning on another visit.
The lentil soup is AMAZING!< /Text>

Great lunch buffet. A few chicken dishes, authentic Vegetables, sauces and delicious Naan. Everything was delicious and flavorful. More people need to start going and support this local small business though or they will be out of business.<//Text>

It's a new flavor of food that this town needs. The lamb saag was perfectly tender. It was even better when combined with the cucumber sauce. Highly recommend eating there!</review>

I absolutely loved eating here! I stood in the corner and watched them make the noodles by hand, it was awesome! This place is cramped, gritty, and not fancy at all. However, if you want some amazing hand pulled noodles, you need to check this place out. Whenever I have friends visit from The South, I take them here.<//Review>

<review>They were worth 5 stars. But theyve changed owners since, added a lunch buffet, and the food has lost some of that quality. Everything is a bit blander and just doeant taste the same anymore.</review></record>

Love this place! Everything we try (tikka masala, tandori chicken, garlic tofu, chicken saag, samosas... so much more) has been soooo yummy!  I used to go to Himalaya on TO blvd but this place taste so much better.  The people are extremely friendly and we feel like family when we go.  The mango lassis are delicious and the staff are actually from the region of the cuisine they serve.  We try new dishes by asking for suggestions from the staff and have never been disappointed. The cheese naan is also a favorite.  Great food and friendly people what more could you ask for?</Text>

The food is just ok, but here, convenience is key. They have a carry-out option designed for students, open to everyone. I think it's around $5 for a couple slices of pizza and a drink. You can feed a large family for $22 with their Family Special--large pepperoni pizza, 2 spaghetti meat sauce, 2 mixed green salads with Italian dressing & 8 bread rolls.<//Text>

We just tried to eat here tonight. Was a long wait to get a table, and once we sat, the party of 2 next to us was still waiting 30 min. to order. We had to leave.< /Review>

So, over the course of an average year, I end up visiting and buying thousands of dollars in parts from PNP. I have to say, this one is the worst. The selection of vehicles and whats left on them is shameful for how big the yard is. Out if 3 cars I came to pick from, none if them were in the row indicated on the website. And one was completely burnt out, with literally zero salvageable parts. So I just go on my way, empty handed, and figure it was just bad timing? But the next day I had to return to retrieve a small part (bmw cam sensor) that i needed for a car i was picking up/ flipping from Merced, back to Oakland. And that, was my worst experience ever, by far, at any PNP, in 30 years, in going to every PNP in the state.  i will leave as another review to follow,. As it deserves its own disgraceful place in these reviews.</Text>

Bring water and snacks for the wait while he removes what he wants, and an umbrella to stay out of the sun. The yard is very hot. They can look up the cars on their computer and tell you where it is in the yard. There are some soda machines in the shop. They have running cars for sale for cheap, too. You have to pay to get into the yard, but you get your hand stamped and can go back in that day. Prices are good for used car parts.< /Review>

Easy access when coming from the freeway (if from out of town) Decent sized parking lot, HUGE yard full of automobiles, decent prices asked.
(Compared to dealerships/stores) the  only minor complaint would be the kind of material a person walks on (2-4 inch med. sized smooth rocks) when searching the selection of cars. if you have difficulty walking in general or specifically on uneven terrain it could be an issue to think of.
Also it's a little slippery if you are there during or after recent rainfall.<//review>

<text>I was a little upset but some of it was my fault. I pulled a part and couldn't pay. My bank had deemed that identity theft occurred. I went back immediately the next day n the part I pulled wasn't there. I also found out the the warranty is only valid if you have the receipt which they didn't tell me. I had left mine in a different car. Overall the the people and service are great and has a nice yard.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

You can ask for the type of car part and they will give you a list of what cars are compatible with yours. And tell you what row  it's on and color.< /Review>

Good if your trying to save a few bucks plus prices there are much cheaper than your local Auto parts store unless your ordering from Ebay. Only bad part is taking things off lol but other than that good selection of cars and you can go on their website beforehand to check if your vehicle is there or anything compatible<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I was referred to Dr. Rahn by my primary dental providers to seek
consultation and information on dental implants.  Dr. Rahn is both
professional and knows his craft! The office staff is welcoming and
friendly.  I'm in the first phase of my dental implant procedures and
so happy to finally feel confident in what the end results will be.  Finding Dr. Rahn is to say the least ....a prayer answered. I know it's a process
I know I'm in goods hands with Dr. Rahn and his staff.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Dr.Rahn’s office is great! My husband, oldest child and now youngest child have had/or having  their wisdom teeth removed there.

The office is relaxing and clean. All of the staff help the clients and support each other.

Dr. Rahn is very personable and really wants his clients comfortable. He took the time to do research & request medical info on my child’s condition so he could understand & come up with the best & safest way to treat her.
I appreciate the extra effort & care so much!

I recommend his office to anyone who asks me about needing an oral surgeon.<//Review>

<text>What a pleasant experience. This was my first time to see Dr. Rahn and was apprehensive going to an unfamiliar dentist. As it turned out, I didn't need to worry. I was greeted by name at the door, escorted to a seat. The receptionist was professional, friendly, and efficient. I signed the forms that she had prepared for me and was called for in only a few minutes. I was led back to an examination room where an assistant took my vitals and asked good questions about my medical history. Again, friendly, professional, and efficient. Dr. Rahn didn't keep me waiting either. He was very helpful. His manner was caring. And once again, friendly, professional, and efficient. It is sad to say that being treated with respect when seeking medical attention can be rare, but respect with a caring attitude is exactly what I found when I visited Dr. Rahn.</text><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

I went with to Dr. Rahn for a tooth extraction. I was nervous. The staff were friendly and professional. My experience was great. I had sedation. I was put at ease and felt no pain, before I knew it it was over. I would highly recommend this dental office! Thank you for helping me.</Review>

During my first consultation, Dr. Rahn explained the procedure in great detail and answered all the questions I had. The day of the procedure I was extremely nervous and anxious, however, the staff assisting Dr. Rahn, did an amazing job at making me feel at ease. It has been a week post surgery and I have not had any pain at all and was only swollen the day of the surgery. Dr. Rahn and his team did an amazing and flawless job. I am very pleased with the outcome and will be recommending this office to friends and family.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to dentists and oral surgery. Dr. Rahn and his staff were amazing and made every effort to help me feel as comfortable as possible, especially since I was coming in to have 3 wisdom teeth removed. They did an excellent job, and though I hope to never see them again, they will now be my first choice for anything in the future.<//text><Time>1601996109044< /Time><rating>5</rating><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>be very careful, staff seems friendly at first.  When setting up my appt, they said they took my insurance.  They didn't tell me until after my appointment that they were "out of network" for my insurance, then tried to charge me over $1000.  When I wouldn't use them, they sent me a bill for the first visit for almost $200.  very shady.<//Review></record>

DO NOT be treated by Dr. Andrew Rahn.  Terrible outcome and horrible service! The implant he did for me came out. Yes, it had to be removed.  Without seeing me or the X-ray from my dentist he had his staff call
me today and inform that he would charge me again to replace the implant.  This was after being told it would be replaced without charge and making an appointment 6 weeks ago. Other oral surgeons and the implant manufacturers typically guarantee their product and work.  Got the implant in my 40’s and I’m very healthy, so not a health or lifestyle issue. I rarely post reviews but felt compelled to share after having very positive experience at another Fresno Oral Surgeon.< /text>

<review>Alma Christianson :  My experience with Doctor Rahn was very good. My procedure was placing a dental implant. He explained in detail what he was going to do in a way I could understand . My anxiety level went down right away once he explained it to me. The staff was also great they were very friendly and treated you with respect.  I would recommend to all my family and friends his services if you need them.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80945d35c250a6c1:0x3b5cc41002bec8df<//gmap_id></record>

The extraction and implant procedures went smoothly, very little discomfort, I was very relaxed and comfortable. Rest of process well explained.  I just cannot help wondering why this is so expensive and not covered by my dental insurance.</text>

I went in for my wisdom teeth removal and they were friendly, fast, sweet, and all around amazing. I was in and the next minute out. They are always available when you need them and you can just call and they are so glad to help. They made me not feel nervous and they just relaxed you and made you ready to get your teeth removed. Then a couple days later they sent me a thank you note and it was just so sweet and cute. It was amazing and definitely recommend going here all around amazing.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
My dentist referred me here since I had to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed. I had my wisdom teeth surgery back in May from Dr. Rahn.  He even did a procedure on my father too.  He was very nice and definitely knows what he does.   I couldn't thank him enough,  and  I had a problem post op I would see him within a day after I called.  The staff is very friendly, answers my questions etc.
I recommend him for any kind of oral surgery.  Thank you so much Dr. Rahn!</Review>

Truly an AMAZING experience!  I went in for all 4 of my wisdom teeth to be pulled.  He was professional and very personable when it came to all my concerns and needs.  I had to schedule a couple of follow-ups due to dry socket.  He was there every step of the way, including the weekend when he was off!
Don’t mess around with this process.  You completely owe yourself the best and Dr. Rahn IS THE BEST!!!< /review>

I have had a couple procedures from Dr Rahn in the past.  I was put to sleep without incident.  I was previously a happy patient,  and had even referred a friend.  Today, however was not a good experience.  It was a horrible experience.  I was supposed to be put to sleep for a tooth extraction.  I was awake the majority of procedure,  trying to tell them how much pain I was in. It did not seem to matter. I wanted to be put to sleep so I wouldn't be aware of what was happening,  wouldn't feel pain. That did not happen.  It was a horrible experience and I'm never going back.</review>

Had tooth removed, was amazed that there was at no time any pain. Not during removal, or any time after. Never had to take any pain meds. Staff was great, and never waited more than 5 minutes after arrival to be seen. Dr. Rahn is very easy to talk to, will take the time to explain, in terms you can understand, any concerns that you might have. Was very impressed with experience.</review>

I have taken two of my children to Dr Rahn and have had pleasant experiences each time. Dr Rahn is very good with kids, to the point where they aren’t scared to go there for procedures. In fact, I am taking my youngest there today on the recommendation of her orthodontist and she isn’t a bit nervous, which is saying something with this kid. The staff is courteous and professional, and we have never experienced the never-ending wait in the waiting room which I appreciate. They also take take CareCredit which is nice.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>The overall experience I had with both Dr. Rahn and Dr. Curiel was amazing. They were straightforward in their instruction, and even better, after the surgery was completed, no pain! At all! They must've done something right! I highly recommend their services to any and all people needing any kind of oral surgery. I am very surprised that I didn't even feel soar. One of the surgeons before I went under (could've been one of the doctors, I forget who, I was nervous) told me that it was very common to to feel soar and sometimes even feel pain post op, but for some reason, it didn't apply to me. In summation, I had a very pleasant experience with this team, and I rate it 10/10!</review>< pics>

<Text>I came to Dr. Rahn to have my bottom two wisdom teeth removed after having my top two taken out by someone else a couple of years ago. I was terrified and never wanted to go back to any dentist again but then my bottom two wisdom teeth were causing me pain and I asked around and was given Dr. Rahn as the person to see. I had the best experience here, I called they got me in to see him with in the week especially because i was in pain. He was kind and very understanding that I was nervous. Everyone in his office is super nice and were willing to answer any questions I had. If any one is looking for a good, nice and caring dentist Dr. Rahn is the one you are looking for. They are the best!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I was referred to Dr. Rahn by my primary dentist in the US (Dr. Shawn Rusk), for the removal of a wisdom tooth that was in a strange position. My father is a dentist in Portugal and up until a few years ago he was the one always taking care of my dental needs. So it's always a bit awkward for me to have other people aside from my dad touching my mouth and teeth. However, I can honestly say that Dr. Rahn and his staff were wonderful. Dr. Rahn was very kind and patient explaining to me what needed to be done. The procedure went much faster and smoother than I had anticipated. I felt no pain and the recovery process is coming along very well. If I ever need a dental surgeon again this is where I will come. I highly recommend this dental office.<//Text>

<text>The staff is overly friendly, professional, knowledgeable and always eager to help.  When I had questions regarding my care, I got answers and they were fast to respond.  Prior to coming here I read up on other patients reviews, wanting to know what they had to say.  What I read I experienced.  These are truly great people, great staff and a good place to get work done.

The wait time was not long (10-15 minutes max!).  I had 2 extractions along with some other work done. The procedure was not long and very clean.  Again, if you are searching for a office, you've found it.

Dr. Rahn & staff-Thank You!<//text>< Name>

I was referred and seen by Dr. Curiel after a serious infection that would not let me eat or even open my mouth. The office was professional and welcoming. The doctor put me at ease and told me what needed to be done. The surgery went well and with lots of rest, as expected post op, i was back to normal.<//review>

Had 4 wisdom teeth extracted.  Couldn't have asked for better results.  OTC pain reliever required for same day post surgery and none other required afterward.  Clean and nice work as there was no bruising after procedure (which could happen).  Professional staff and nice personal followup call by Dr. Rahn.

Note:  Office located near a busy parking lot next to St. Agnes Hospital on the east side near ambulance parking.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I am absolutely terrified of dentist. I have had some really terrible experiences through the years.
I had to have a tooth extracted. Dr Rahn was very kind and gentle. He talks to you during the procedure. Couple of times he even talked to the tooth which was quite funny. He makes you feel comfortable from the very beginning. He talks very nice to his staff which is an indication that he is real. He is very personable. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
I would recommend him to anyone who needs any oral surgery done.< /Text>< pics>

I was very nervous to have my extractions done but Dr. Rahn made me feel very comfortable and made my short stay very pleasant. Him and his assistants answered each of my questions thoroughly and with care. I would recommend them for further dental work as well. Thank you!< /Review>

I was referred to Dr. Andrew Rahn by Dr. Moss of Fresno Dental Professionals...

Dr. Rahn and his amazing staff had their hands full with me. I had impacted wisdom teeth and a severe fear of surgery as I've never had any procedure done. They spent extra time consulting with me, worked with me on scheduling, and took excellent care of me. I was terrified the morning of the procedure and they were very patient with me, I actually didn't mind the procedure at all. I think I talked through most of it, further adding to the high maintenance job I was. I didn't follow the detailed post op instructions and wound up with dry socket and for two weeks after. They fit me in every day I had pain to fill the socket with a gel substance that alleviated my pain.

I wouldn't recommend anyone other than Dr. Rahn if you need to get your wisdom teeth extracted. I'm healing very well and I must say that my only regret is not having the procedure done sooner. I feel great now! Thank you, Dr. Rahn!</Review>

Our orthodontist referred us to Dr. Rahn for our daughters wisdom teeth, and for a 16 year old, this can be unnerving, but everything went great, they covered the procedure, answered questions. Everyone in the office is friendly, and Dr. Rahn has a great sense of humor! We'd recommend Dr. Rahn to anyone looking for a great oral surgeon.<//review>

A few months ago I had my wisdom teeth out, Dr. Curiel did my wisdom teeth removal and he was awesome. Everything went smoothly and post op when I had questions he was quick to respond. The office is clean and welcoming and they make sure you are comfortable during the whole procedure. Thank you again Dr. Curiel!</text>

<review>I was so afraid to have my wisdom teeth pulled I avoided it for 15 years. Dr Rahn and his staff were amazing and made the process very smooth. I tend to be a little bit over the top when it comes to pain. The office staff had no issue with me stopping in occasionally to make sure that my healing was going accordingly. I appreciate how nice they were and how caring they were as well. I would highly recommend Dr. Rahn and his staff to anyone.< /review>< resp>

I first had to visit Dr. Grady in January.  I had suffered a heart attack and then, nearly immediately afterward, got an abcessed tooth.  The doctor and her staff were kind, gentle, and helpful.  I could finally get the tooth extracted today.  To say things went smoothly would be an understatement.  I didn't even feel the extraction and, although I usually cringe when I get shots of Novocaine, this time I barely felt it.  The staff did a great job of getting me to relax, and I was in and out of the office in around an hour and a half, which I thought was fabulous.  I was impressed and I am grateful.<//Review>

My husband had sung the praises of Dr Rahn several yrs ago when he had a tooth pulled under general anesthesia.  Fast forward to this yr when   another tooth was beginning to cause pain.  Since our insurance had changed to an HMO, which the Dr doesn't accept, we tried another provider, but Don, who has heart problems and severe anxiety of pain,  realized he only trusted Dr Rahn with extractions.
After scrambling to find new insurance, which cost us $41 more on our already tight budget, then wait for an appointment, the day finally arrived.  Dr convinced Don that a local plus nitrous oxide would be all that was  needed for the by now broken off and absessed tooth.  Plus Kathy had given us a price that was now affordable without using general anesthsia.
The deed was done so quickly and painlessly that my husband was amazed and so relieved!
Needless to say, Don will be back to have several more teeth pulled.
We highly recommend this surgeon and his patient and efficient staff!!<//Text>

<Review>I was told I needed to have a molar pulled by an endodontist.   They suggested some doctors and I told them I wanted one in my network.  The first one they called did not accept my insurance and then they called Dr. Rahn's office.  They let me talk to their office, and I asked twice if they accepted my insurance.  I was told yes.  I made the appointment for the next day but then was told I had to pay the full amount since my insurance did not cover me in California.  I have lived here 7 years and never had a problem with any of my health insurance paying.   I paid the full amount and was told the insurance company would send me a check.  When checking online, I found out Dr. Rahn was paid over $300 for this procedure.  We called the office and asked for our money and was told it was being sent in the next 7 days.  It is now 14 days and we still have no money.  Although he did a great job, I do not like the way his office handles the billing.  I know I would not use him again since they lied on the first day when I asked about coverage.  If they had told me no, I would have looked for a surgeon who would have accepted my insurance.<//Review></record>

The assistant who prepped me was very sweet, and even gave me a blanket when she saw I was cold! Even in my delusional state post-surgery, I made sure to give her a hug goodbye and thanked both her and Dr. Curiel for their work.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Soooooo I've always had a DEATHLY strong fear of dentists. My fears include pain & waking up in the middle of a procedure.

When I found out I need extensive dental / oral surgery done I was so scared! I went for my consultation with Dr. Curiel and he seemed kind enough ....

Fast forward to 12/27/18, I arrived at my appointment right on time. The previous week at work all i could think about was what could go wrong, i cant believe i spent so much time thinking about that!
Why???
My procedure and recovery has been a breeze!!!!
1. Dr. Curiel was so gentle with me! No bruise after my IV insertion and removal.
2. With the exception of the 1st day (day of procedure), I havent needed any narcotic medication to manage my pain. Only Walmart brand ibuprofen!
3. My fiance, Diana, was treated with respect & was checked on while I was in office.
4. All the office staff & nurses have been so kind and sweet to me everytime I have came into the office.

I highly recommend Dr. Curiel & Dr. Rahn for all your oral surgical needs.< /Review>

<user>118023497807453837984</user><text>I was referred here by Dr. Youssef and I was in horrible pain. I was seen so quickly and had nothing but the best experience. When I went in the staff was very friendly and the Dentist, Dr. Curiel was more then awesome. He walked me though the whole procedure step by step and answered my questions. His staff also helped me out with any questions I had and were so welcoming. I was in and out before 12 pm. I would highly recommend this office.

Thank you Dr. Curiel and awesome team!!!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

I had been reffered here by my dentist but put off getting my wisdom teeth removed for a few years and for the last year they had been killing me to the point I couldn't take it anymore. I was able to make a consultation appointment fast. They take CT imaging of your teeth first thing, and then I met with Dr. Curiel who is incredibly nice, took his time, & explained everything very clearly. He prescribed pain meds and antibiotics way ahead of time so I wouldn't have to wait to pick them up after the procedure. The day of the surgery went super smooth. The staff was very attentive and constantly monitoring me and asking how I was doing. Dr. Curiel was able to extract the teeth in 15 minutes so I wasn't out for very long at all, and I went home feeling amazing! I've had minimal pain and swelling so far. I haven't even needed to take any of the prescription painkillers, just advil. He even called me on his cell phone a few hours after the surgery to check up on me, and the office gave me a gift card to Jamba Juice I think! Loved everything about my surgery, highly recommend this office and Dr. Curiel.</Text>< Pics>

<review>I was extremely impressed with the excellent work Dr. Rhan did with my son! My son needed bone grafting, an implant, and two wisdom teeth pulled.  Everything came out so good that my son didn't even need the pain killers.  My son had a very similar procedure done 4 years ago by supposedly one of the best in the field in Visalia but we were not impressed.  I can definitely say Dr. Rhan is the BEST in this field.  My son will not be going to anyone else but him from now on.  I wish someone would had referred Dr. Rhan to me 4 years ago! To all you particular parents who only want the best for your child, Dr. Rhan is the one to go to without a doubt.< /review>< pictures>

Let's start at the beginning of the experience.  We arrived at 6:20 and stood in line until we were able to order at 6:43.  We each ordered the Duo combo.  None of the tables had been wiped down, we found the least messy one we could and sat down for a 30 minute wait.  To be fair the cashier had warned us that our order would take 15-20 minutes.

The first of three meals arrived, the other two were a few minutes later.  The onion rings I paid extra for were cold and the sliders were right behind temperature wise.  The trays they were served on were ice cold, so that didn't help.

I ordered the Merguez and lamb patties.  I could not tell the difference between them, so I'm not sure I got what I ordered.  The sliders were good, though not as good as others like 5 Guys or Smash or...  My son ordered a regular beef patty and a chicken breast patty.  The chicken was huge and spiced with pepper.  He enjoyed the sandwich a lot.

Overall the food as just OK.  I will not be going back anytime soon though.  The wait is far too long and the food is not worth the $10/plate with that kind of wait This is not the place for a quick bite.  Though I did not purchase a beer you should expect to pay $6 on average for a glass.<//Review>

<text>The food is to expensive for what you get.the food in my picture costs $28+ on top of it they forgot to make us our food I waited 30 min for 2 burgers and 2 fries. The fries are just slices of small potatos you can see them in the pic as well. All in all I didnt have a bad experience but there is NO reason for me to return. 5 Guys is far better and Red Robbin is Far Far better. Red Robbin you get way more food bottomless fries for less money and a better atmosphere.</text>< date>

Best burgers in town without a doubt. On a scale from 1 through 10 I give it a 9.5. It was a nice environment with friendly people. Not fast food so don’t go in expecting your food to be served in minutes. Owner was engaging and polite. Had no problems except portion sizes were small.<//Review>

Just all right-- albeit the crew was new and pretty obviously not all the process kinks had been worked out (we waited over twenty minutes for our food).
The menu looks interesting, but we all chose ground  beef. It was way over cooked. Good beefy flavor, but tough and chewy.
In fairness, I'll go back in a couple of weeks and update my review.</review>

They have free kid Mondays, so your kids can order a kids' meal ($5.99) -3 oz burger or chicken strips, fries, and drink.

They also have vegetarian and gluten free options.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6O9pKsVBzsiKP-tZvezUUhgXcsS6AJEmUi7Ex=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Decided to give this place a try because it is a new restaurant close to work.

First as soon as I started ordering, I was told that they were out of their fries/chips, so they could only give us wedge fries. Fine, I begin to order a burger to be interrupted telling me they were out of beef. . . A burger place out of beef. Went ahead and ordered chicken wings instead and a drink.

Went to the soda machine and EVERYTHING was out except for diet drinks and Minute Maid stuff. I let the manager know, and she looked at me and said, “did you want something else?” I said any normal soda would be fine. She came around and looked at the machine, put in a new cartridge of coke, shut the machine and walked away. The coke on the machine was still out, she came back to look at it and said “oh, that’s strange” and walked away again. No offer for a refund on my nearly $4 drink, not even an apology. Better yet, when other customers came in, they kept offering them drinks without even telling everyone. After about 5 people complained, I saw them give one person a refund.

After about 40 minutes, my chicken came out, and it was ... decent? Definitely not bad, definitely not great, but definitely NOT worth the wait or price.

I coughed up the experience to the restaurant being new, but gave it one more shot last week. Soda machine worked fine, and they had all food options available. Still long wait and not great service, food was again... decent.< /Text>< pictures>

This new burger place was fantastic! The customer service was great. He was friendly and funny, helpful and patient too!  I dislike being rushed to order especially if I've never been there. So it was nice to not be rushed.  We took our food to go.  There was 5 of us and everybody really enjoyed the burgers (beef classics).  I hope this place continues to do well here Elk Grove!<//text>

I understand the staff is new, but this is absolutely ridiculous! I ordered two burgers and a shake to-go. Waited 40 minutes for my Burger's when there was only 2 other people in the location. When brought up to the staff all they had to say was we're new, sorry. No compensation, nothing for waiting close to an hour for a burger. I would not recommend this place. If your looking for good food and environment I would go elsewhere.<//Review>< pictures>

40 minute wait time.  Was not impressed with the burger.  Bc the vegetables were on the bottom and not on top of the party, the bottom bun was wet and soggy.  It was an unforgettable burger, but not in a good way.  The only thing that was good we're the fries and the soda.  I doubt I'll be coming back<//review>

One was a chicken burger with 2 regular burgers. Burgers are small and nothing exceptional. Fries are odd and not cooked well. $32 for 2 trios & 2 sodas. Not worth it.

<Text>First thing's first!! Do NOT go in there thinking this is some McDonalds! The food will never take 2 minutes to come out, and I noticed many people were angry even after waiting for 10 minutes. Good news is, if you are there when the owner (James) is there, he will keep you entertained as well as the ladies who work in the front. The food is absolutely amazing and totally worth the wait. They also have beer if you're impatient and decide to relax while you wait. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the rewards program (you earn points every single time you order there). I went there once, and then when I came back the next time, I was able to redeem $5.30 off my order but I saved my points to rack them up. I hate to see all these negative reviews on yelp and on google reviews because it sounds like people are just mostly impatient or just assuming the burgers are pre-made and warmed up for them. Try it for yourself! And when you go in, make sure you take a peak through the back window into the kitchen to see how hard these employees actually work! Stay optimistic people, they're still new and learning.<//Text>< name>

Tl;dr- visit occasionally, not going to be my main burger joint.

The burgers are small but yummy. Craft beer was $7. $15 for two burgers and a beer. Lots of customization options (for extra fees).<//Text>

<review>Went there today just to try the sides. It was busy, but there were only two people in line ahead of us, and plenty of available tables. It still took 40 minutes to get three orders of fries!  I cannot even imagine how long we would have been there if we had ordered burgers too. Also the BurgerIM fries would be much better if they were cooked longer - they were too cold and soggy. They are still new, and getting the hang of getting the food cooked and out. All of the employees were really friendly though! We'll be back for burgers after the kitchen staff gets the hang of things.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1559935997072, 'text': 'We appreciate your review, it helps us understand what we can improve on.

One person working the register even though the line was to the door.  Took 30 minutes to get to the register (and there were about 5-6 people in front of us) another 25 to get our food.  Napkin dispenser empty and didn't get refilled even after we asked for napkins and told them the dispenser was empty (we were brought 5 napkins for 6 people), someone spilled food on the floor by the trash can that didn't get cleaned up the whole time we sat there.  No management out and around overseeing and it is the official opening weekend! Not a good sign, too bad.< /text>< rate>

<review>I came to town from LA to visit my friends in Elk Grove and we all decided to go out to a restaurant nearby. I saw this place and decided to try this place out. OMG! The burgers are perfect portions in the party box to share. We got the Turkey Caliente with Fried Egg, Lettuce Wrapped Crispy Chicken Buffalo, Falafel Classic, and Dry Age cowboy style with an Onion ring and bacon inside. I simply love the fact that we can customize any burgers. I'm in heaven, so hard to get this much variety. My friend who asked for the Dry Age wanted it Rare which was cooked slightly on the outside. No other burger places would do this, that’s was amazing in itself. The owners of the restaurant came up to us and introduced themselves, I thought that was pretty cool and their super nice. This will be my to-go restaurant when I come back. The whole experience was awesome. I will have to try their famous sweet crunchy chili garlic wings and oreo shake.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Had to ask for the third ordrr twice.  It arrived after the two others finished their meal.  Took it to go as everyone else already finished.

<Text>Burgers and fries were ok, nothing to write home about. Biggest issues was how looooonnnnggggg everything took. The line, the food prep, so slow. The employees were apologizing to everyone they brought their order out to. The ambiance is also very blah, no music even.</Text>< pics>

Hopefully this location of Burger im has the halal meat. Hopefully they realize there are so many Muslims in Elk Grove that need halal, you guys will have way more customers. If it’s halal you guys have a guaranteed customer. :)< /Text>

Literally watched my food sit and wait on the counter for 15 minutes. And the lady instead of apologizing she tried to play dumb like which plate was sitting out I’m like the one you bagged up for me. They offered to make my meal agin but already been in there about 40 minutes just took my food and left. I honestly did not trust the kitchen workers with making my food agin.< /review>

Can’t tell you how good the burgers are. Walked in, no one in line, before I even got to the counter they said it was going to be an hour wait and it looked like most everyone was waiting for food. There was maybe 15 people, 75% full. Not sure why it was going to be a one hour wait.< /Text>

Great vibe in the store with a pretty deep variety. Went in to find a suit and was greated by Daniel immediately. Super helpful! I highly recommend asking for him if you need thorough help finding something your size and price. He was very professional and didn't make me feel rushed. Over-all a great experience but one flaw I noticed is a lack of mirrors. This store builds its reputation on the "way you look". It should have more areas for you to see how you "look".</Review>

My 2 sons and I went allthe way across town to get wedding tuxes for them and walked out with nothing but my anger and disappointment. The guy who i was talking didnt seem to know anything avout what was foing on in their store, they had no kid sizes like toddlers dont matter. I couldnt even order the sizes in the tux i wanted and i couldnt rent even what they had for the duration of time i needed!!! Like, what kind of place is this. A complete waste of time. I usually dont give bad reviews but for something this important as a wedding and they couldnt do a darn thing for me.

This company advertises for suit deals until you visit the store then the clerk tells you he never seen those special commercials and try to upsale you on more expensive suits. Seemed like a racket so I just left and bought something elsewhere. The clerks were not that attentive anyway and wouldn't even greet me. So why spend my hard earned money there.< /review>

When the person that greeted us heard we were interested in buying a suit, he got interested due to a potential sale. However when we said we weren't interested in the starting $700 price he named, he just walked off. Funny he stated that for a good suit, plus adding the shirt, shoes and tie, etc... It would be around $1000, come on be real. We went elsewhere, obviously, but when we walked back by the store it was funny that there is an advertisement on their window stating custom made suits starting at $395, yet somehow this employee wasn't aware of that or didn't want to settle for a sale that low.< /review>

Ammie and everyone are Great the only exception was the Lady doing the alterations , I ordered a Custom fit suit had the 1st fitting they made some alterations at the 2nd fitting the sleeves just had too much material I let them know everything was Great except the sleeves didnt , they accommodated and brought her over to measure for the alteration of the sleeves and she had an attitude " Isnt this the 2nd fitting " I said that is correct but the sleeves aren't right bid you this is supposed to be a custom suit
Aside from that everyone one was Great and attentive and offered me Great Customer Service . Thus the 4 star rating<//text>

I like that they let the wedding party come in at their own pace to get fitted and pay their bill. And they coordinate colors with David's bridal. There was quite a wait, but it is prom season so it's understandable.<//Text>

When it came time to get the color for the tie and such i told the lady that was helping us my dress was white and gold, she pointed me to an ugly brown color and when i said no and pointed to the color i wanted she rolled her eyes, not to mention she kept talking to me and looking at me like i was stupid...

My husband and I went there so he could purchase his wedding tux, and not only was the associate extremely friendly and helpful, he even remembered me 6 months later when I called him over the phone and asked him what size my husband was and what would be the best choices in clothing for a man who doesn’t dress up often. If you ever shop at the men’s wearhouse in MODESTO,CA ASK FOR ANTHONY. He’ll help you with anything you need no matter how long it may take!👍🏻< /Review>< name>

I went to this store to purchase a sport coat and some accessories - I've never really had nice clothes for formal occasions.  The staff were very courteous and helpful.  The individual who assisted me spent lots of time with me and was very patient, helping me understand what clothes could be worn together well, as I wasn't sure what colors to match up.  He helped me find the accessories I needed and I got them all on sale for half price.  The tailoring for the coats was very reasonably priced, and has a lifetime warranty with free adjustments.  Great experience!!</Text>

Ok so these guys are osm, very accommodating qnd proffesional! They are hands down the best around! I happened to sit on a chair that pulled the threads on my dress pants and they fixed it for free with no appointment!! I cannot rave enough about their freindliness and helpfulness: they totally have my business for the next forseeable future.</Review>

Super friendly and welcoming staff!! So glad I stopped in. It's a hidden little juice gem in the shopping plaza. Fresh juice was made to order and perfectly tasty.</Text>

Delicious and fresh juice!  Avocado Sandwich Yum!  They have a good selection of items. Unfortunately they do not have legitimate Acai (it's the ice cream version).</text>

<text>The place is great if you want to get a smoothie. My kids love the carrot one. It's pretty sweet. They don't have a changing table but it's a pretty nice sized bathroom.</text></record>

Delicious smoothies & the BEST tuna salad sandwich in town. The customer service is always friendly. I've been coming here for 18 years & hope there's many more to come!< /Text>

I ordered a turkey salad with avocado over the phone. They took my name, and it was ready in about ten minutes. They gave a lot of avocado for only a dollar extra, and the meal was tasty and filling. I'll definitely be going back!<//Review>

The food is great, wholesome sandwiches that will fill you up for moderate pricing. The smoothies are also equally good. You can get a nice deal on both if you go at their lunch special hours from 11-2pm. That being said, im rating this place 3 stars rather than 4 or 5 stars because of different issues mostly minor gripes but one big consistent problem. First the minors: the interior is very bland and unwelcoming, the tables and chairs are uncomfortable and generic, the bathroom looks like you'd go to it at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, and the service is lackluster. I would forgive these issues if it wasnt for this one thing that seems to always happen to me. I know, the suspense is killing you right now right, what could it be? Well its this, if you order big or happen to go while there are at least 2 or more people in the store then your order is very likely to be messed up or forgotten, ive had multiple times where they forgot my avocado that i generously pay for or the peanut butter in my drink or get my orders completely wrong and to only be helped about 15 minutes after. This place seems to always mess up orders or mix orders. Besides the inconsistency within the orders, the food is good, but i question why bother sometimes due to this , because, as you can imagine if you go often enough you'd get tired of not getting what you pay for. 3 stars. Average.</Text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>I'm addicted to their acai bowl and come here at least 3-4 time a week. The Sandwiches are made with fresh daily ingredients and large enough for wifey and I to share.

I'm a health nut and this by far is my favorite place to eat on the go. This is a family owned business and love how they know me by name.

The staff are kind hearted workers that actually provides genuine excellent customer service. My only suggestion is to call your order ahead, sometimes they are really busy and you may wait awhile. But either then that this place is highly recommended.<//text>< pics>

Juice Adventure has very exotic and sweet tasting smoothies. My favorite has to be Mango Sunset. Although their smoothies are pricey since the smallest fruit smoothie is $3.85.<//text>

I took my three parakeets in for their usual beak trimming. Claudia is the best and very knowledgeable about a variety of birds.. it is a great place to look for a new bird or a cage and they also have a big selection of bird toys... food for your pet birds or for wild birds in your back yard...</Review>

Seven years ago we had our very first bird picked from the store. Four months later we got our second bird from there too.. Now we have nine birds' family with us. Dad bird and mom bird with seven their baby birds are happily living together with us. We go to the Basic Bird store for bird food and toys often since our birds love everything from there. When we travel,  we let our birds hotel in the store with the good care from people working there. Love our birds and love the store too. The owner Claudia is a wonderful person who loves birds 🐦 ❤ 💕.<//review>

I came here to buy a kitten, and he was a wonderful kitten. The adoption process was a little bit rocky, but the reason for my review is because the lady I spoke to once I began buying cat necessities recommended some terrible products to me. Their litter boxes and food pans had a thick layer of grime on them and clearly had not seen maintenance or care in many weeks, the litter was terrible quality and heavily overcharged, and the food was smelly and extremely expensive as well. I get supporting small businesses, but there's no reason I should be spending twice the amount of money for 1/3 of the weight and 10% of the quality I get from a chain store.</review>

The people working here are not very friendly. A lot of the cages are overcrowded. I wanted to purchase/adopt an older parrot that was there, but was told they were keeping him for breeding. Why breed more birds when there are rescues FULL of birds waiting for a forever home? Clearly this lady only cares about sales and money and not about the actual birds.</text>

I purchased my amazon years ago from them and she was  amazingly smart and my sweetheart. Fast forward to now that I am retired and have more time for another bird, I chose a hand-raised conure who is the delight of my family: sassy, smart, and so willing to learn and do tricks.  We tried for a few years to adopt from rescue sites, but the process was incredibly difficult and discouraging.<//Text>< name>

I wish I can give them 0 star. Bad customer service. I went there ( not many peoples in the store, about 5 peoples including employees). One big guy came and ask me what are you looking here? Then I said I looking around to see stuff the get for my parrot. Then he say we don't have space for you to look around then he walked away. I'm understand that the crazy COVID out there , but I came to the store with the N95 face mask, and not many peoples in the store by the time I came.
I will not coming back here again to spend any cent to this store . and I don't recommend my friends co come here.</Review>

Great place for birds and other animals, just put deposit down on baby pineapple conure, third bird we buy from here. Claudia the owner is great you can see that she cares for her feathery creatures and the furry ones also. Her birds are always cared for very well, when you buy from here your buying a bird who has been handled with care from day one.< /text>

<date>1579402399001</date><text>While this place has great selection of toys and all THINGS for birds, visiting and seeing the conditions in which some of the birds there live (that are for sale) BROKE MY HEART. Some birds like conures had a one very small toy and some birds had no toys in the cages. What a sad situation  - there are bird toys everywhere and all over the store and one only or none where they are supposed to be, with the birds. They seem to treat the birds as goods to quickly sell, but not really caring of the conditions they live in.  Birds are very intelligent animals that need to be engaged and have toys, otherwise they will become depressed and sick. I am not rating the store offering because they have literally everything. I am rating it poorly because they must understand that birds are live animals who have emotions, and not just business. I left the store very sad and I don't know if I will go back.<//text></record>

<Text>Super disappointed. Drove over from SF to find them closed with a sign on the door and the phone ringing off the hook. They seem knowledgeable and they have the best selection of lead/zinc-safe cages in the bay area, but we can't drive back so we ended up picking a cage through the window and buying from Amazon. I like to support local bay area businesses, but I need them there to do it.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>I have been a customer of Your Basic Bird for decades. There aren't many of this exotic bird stores left,  but such stores are so much better than the big pet store chains! This store has a great selection of birds of all sizes and varieties. The owner, Claudia, is very knowledgeable about companion birds. It's clear that Claudia really cares about companion birds, and she will not sell a bird if she doesn't think it's going to a good home.If you are thinking about getting a parrot or smaller companion bird, I recommend that you talk to her. She will try to influence your decision;  she will give you facts based on her wealth of experience. The store also has a great selection of bird food;  pellets, treats, and seed mixes at competitive prices.  As well as bird cages and equipment. They offer grooming services, and twice a year Claudia hosts a travelling veterinarian who is very good. A great opportunity to get a health check up, micro chipped and groomed at a very affordable price. I highly recommend this store!< /review>< resp>

This is a great bird store. They have a variety of birds. A great selection of toys for your bird. All this at a incredible  price. We just bought a bird there and I looked for some extra things on line we would need for the bird and I found them all cheaper at their store.< /Review>

Claudia is very knowledgeable about birds in general and is always willing to answer any questions you have about raising your bird. They have toys, food, and offer adoptions for birds and other small animals as well. The shop is pretty small and crowded and they can get pretty busy so getting attention for whatever you need can be tricky sometimes.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We made the trek out to Your Basic Bird today, as part of my ongoing search for a feathered friend. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They answered questions from both me and my children, with patience. Although I did not ultimately find just the right bird today, we plan on coming back again at a later date.<//text>

The staff at Your Basic Bird are fantastic and really caring. I just bought two parakeets and they took the time to educate me on all aspects of proper bird care to ensure the birds were getting treated right. I would recommend this store to anyone who is interested in getting birds or if you already have a birds and just need great prices on food and supplies.<//review>

<review>We've bought three birds and all of them were healthy and excellently socialized. They also sell good quality pet supplies for any kind of pet and   truly care about the animals they own and sell. Some of the staff can be a little stand offish but I think they've been working to change that. We sadly had to give up two of the birds we had bought from them and a rescue bird we had and they were incredibly understanding, helpful and we knew they were in good hands. I wanted to thank your basic bird for everything they've done for us and helpful they've been in our time of need.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>After moving to the area, I brought my bird here for grooming a couple times and also once for boarding - I immediately felt uncomfortable when I walked in and I should have gone with my gut and found a new place right away.
The owner is the only person in the entire store who does grooming, so it's really hard to get an appointment, and the appointments that I was able to make were horrible. One time, she was 20 minutes late to my appt. So I just had to stand there in the teeny store and wait, while I was in everyone's way. Another time, she took so long doing the grooming, and held my bird so tightly that he was in extreme distress/overheated afterward. He was panting and holding his wings out and pacing - I've had my parrot for 15 years and I've never once seen him so poorly after being groomed.
The store is dirty and small and cluttered and they just do the grooming right there at the cash register. On top of that, all their parrots are tightly packed together, in relatively small cages, and they don't have a seperate space for boarded birds, so random people can just walk up and touch/mess with your parrot while they're boarded.
I knew it wasn't great, but my suspicions were confirmed yesterday when I finally found someplace else to take my bird for grooming - the other place I went was exceptionally clean and organized and open. They had an employees only boarding room (no public allowed in) and a seperate room for grooming, that looked like a proper vet room with clean tools and tables.
To top that all off, the groomer was horrified when she looked at my parrot's wings - she asked who had clipped him before, because his wings were cut waaaay too short. I felt absolutely awful knowing that I had brought him to your basic bird and allowed him to get mistreated there.

I don't know what's up with all these good reviews here - maybe people who have been coming to her for years and just don't realize how bad it is? Or people who think there aren't any other options?

Needless to say, I won't ever come back to this shop and I'm sorry that I ever gave them my business in the first place. If you're a parrot owner, please please take your baby somewhere else. Its worth the drive to go someplace with clean facilities and knowledgable, capable staff that can give your precious parrot the quality of care it deserves.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>This place is heaven for bird owners and enthusiasts. They know things like how popular pellet brands were formulated (research on cockstiels in the 90s), which size perches are best for birds at various ages, which birds can be kept outside, how to prevent egg-laying, which hamster toys are safe for birds (and which are not), how to choose a cage for a handicapped bird, etc, etc. You can't get that at a petco. Plus, their prices and selection are better. And they love their birds. There's no reason to go anywhere else.</Text>< Resp>

YBB is the best bird store I have ever visited! We got our adorable little male cockatiel from here and he was the sweetest, most affectionate little guy I've ever had. Unfortunately, he passed away (due to an infection, not because of YBB) but we will absolutely get our next feathered friend from YBB when they get in more cockatiels. I would recommend this shop over any other. The birds are happy, clean and loved and Claudia is incredibly knowledge about birds. She goes above and beyond to teach her customers and make sure they are making the right choice.<//review>

We were just discriminated by an employee, his name was Gareth. We are Latinos he said that we were there to steal a bird he denied us service. We didn't even do anything. We were there to purchase another bird and he hovered over us.</text>

(Translated by Google) If what you are looking for is a bird, believe me, they have all kinds of birds and they guide you a lot to take care of them, they have a lot of experience, that is, they are a bit expensive but for the knowledge it is worth it.

(Original)
Si lo que buscas es un ave creeme ahí tienen de todo tipo y te orientan mucho para cuidarlas tienen mucha experiencia, eso sí son un poco caras pero por el conocimiento vale la pena..< /Text>

All I ordered was 2 frozen cokes and 2 large fries. When I got to the pickup window and discovered they were giving me 2 regular cokes by mistake I offered to pay the difference. The manager was called over and said he would take care of it and asked me to pull around front. So I did. 20 minutes went by and a worker came outside and apologized but they were out of coke freeze supplies. I asked for my regular cokes and left.

I'd go on, but I think we can all see the frustrations.< /text>

I've never waited 30 mins in the drive thru. I'm not sure how this is even possible. Then they forgot one if the meals and immediately walked away and  never came back to the window. The lobby is closed so I had to walk back to the window. Absolutely terrible.<//Review>

Took my kids to go get some drinks so I can get a coffee. We were literally the only car there. It took them 15 minutes to give us a large soda and medium iced coffee. And not only that as I tried to get the attention of the employees, that were all walking around without masks, they seen me looked and went on talking with the others. Then when the shift manager finally came he told me that I couldn't even get the hot mocha I orders because the machine was down. Can't believe I waiting in like to be ignored for over 15 minutes<//Review>

Long story short: I ordered 2 doubles with extra ketchup and pickles. They gave me extra onions.
I call and tell them they messed up and I don't have a receipt to do their survey.
The employee responds with "oh I'm sorry, we don't have enough pickles."
It's ok to say you guys don't, just let a customer know.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Horrible service,  should replace management. Worst service i had ever had. Bunch of dummies work there. The current management just sits there and eats pies,drinks milkshakes and mcflurrys all day. That's why they are always out. I mean really look at them.<//Review>< Pics>

Worst service ever! I work for UBER EATS and my app instructions were to pick up in store as to enter through the main entrance but the main entrance was totally CLOSED as they made me go thru the drive-thru making me wait 20 mins for an order placed on the customer's phone. See attached two photos one is the app pick up instructions and the other is the actual restaurant's sign outside their door saying it was CLOSED!< /review>

Price is much too high,  portions are much too small (almost no meat on their burgers) and flavor has become nothing but a salty flavorless mess. Unexceptionable is the only way to what McDonald's has become.< /text>

I waited at curbside for 25 minutes. Cars in the drive thru were moving alot faster. The meat patties were overly salty. Got a notice about 10 min in saying visit us next time, like they cleared my order and I waited another 15 minutes.< /text>

I ordered 3 drinks, the wait time was over 40 minutes and the order was wrong. All we got was an incorrect order and an empty apology. Never going back to this place.</Review>

<name>Estefanie Fuentes</name><time>1596487442752<//time><Rate>2< /Rate><Review>I ordered single meals with no soda, a mocha frap. Two fries & a happy meal this early afternoon.  I actually wanted three fries I told the girl I wanted a quarter pounder #2 with just the fries. She said they don’t do that. Okay I understand but I told her give me the quarter pounder & fries. The girl on the speaker gasped rudely. I didn’t end up getting the three fries. But I did get the two sausage w. egg McMuffins. Be professional. And we can hear you!
Btw, The two egg sausage McMuffins were for my mother-in-law & brother-in-law. She recently lost her husband & my brother-in-law is sick. They had to share their fries. He has special needs.
I apologized to the cashier for ordering single meals & told him the girl who took my order sounded bothered for the way I ordered but he didn’t mind to care he just checked if my order was correct & had me pay which is totally understandable that’s his job that is all he had to do. But it disappointed me. My daughters birthday was yesterday. I hadn’t bought her a happy meal in a long time. I wasn’t asked what gender & she was sad she didn’t get a girl toy. 😕< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Have been there multiple times and they get my order right 2/10 times either wrong sauce, wrong drink, or a small order of fries in a large box. I order two kids meals and they give me juice boxes, I ordered orange soda,  I told her at the window before grabbing the drinks, she sighs and says okay. First a little rude, then she hands me two kid sodas COVERED in soda, how hard is it to fill a soda without over filling? I have alot of stories i could put on here for why they get one star but its not worth anymore of my time. Thanks for the wrong sized fries again McDonalds!</Review>

I couldn't really hear the girl on the drive thru and she ended up ordering a fanta orange for me but I'm sure it was just misunderstanding. I tried a big mac for the first time ever. I was very unimpressed. It was tinier than  expected and the sauce was gross but I didnt factor that into this rating. And I didnt get ketchup with my fries after asking for it.

Worst McDonald's in Bakersfield. The lobby is still closed, meaning everyone must use drive-thru = long waits. The drive-thru is double lane, but one of the speakers is usually broken = longer waits. Orders for Uber pickup are never ready on time. Overall, this McDonald's just wastes everyone's time.<//Review>

Horrible assistant manager. She spoke to me so rude when I told her my door dash order was wrong. She blamed door dash. How can it be them, they can’t open our bags and check. I’m out 2 cheeseburgers and 2 double cheeseburgers. Then she challenged me to come down there then hung up the phone on me. What a LOSER....</text>

< review>
When you going to this location, I went to the drive-through and sat behind a lady ordering for more than 5 minutes, and she showed no plans of moving. So, I backed up and went inside to get my order that I wanted. Upon going inside, all of the employees were Very young, except for the manager. When I walked in, nobody acknowledged my presence. The workers were behind the counter talking in a sort of half circle sort of stance. There was a person at the takeout window still taking the order of the lady I was behind in line outside. I counted to 10 out loud and nobody acknowledged me or looked up at the counter, so I said, “Well, this was a learning experience. I got poor service outside, came inside and there’s not one person at the counter to take my order, and nobody acknowledged me coming in. I’ll go elsewhere thank you.” I turned around to leave, and the manager said with urgency, “No, I’ll take your order.“ I replied, “No, I’m good thank you I’ll go elsewhere,” while waving my hand and left.</review>

Awful......clueless worker at the drive thru.  Waited 5 minutes to place order and 10+ to pay.  I  do not understand why they have the most inept person taking orders and money.  Had to correct order 3 times.< /Review>

<text>Drive thru can be quick most of the time. I find that the staff are talking and socializing at work more than working. The outside looks clean, but homeless do tend to congregate here because of the bus stop right out front. One time, i found a large piece of bone in s chicken nugget (which I will never eat again). When I returned to get a replacement meal because the nuggets were no longer desirable, the manager told me it was an onion and “what do you want?”. Clearly, I am more than able to tell the difference between a hard piece of bone between my teeth and a soft piece of dehydrated onion. My first job was working at McDonald’s and i was appalled at the way the manager was speaking to me.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Very hungry in the distance a big building near the intersection where the cars drive past you the car lights hitting the ground my stomache was growling.I approached a crosswalk and this is a story of what happens next as soon as I come face to face with a young lady standing behind a wall next to a kitchen behind a cash register machine she takes my order touching the pos she then hands me my receipt.This is a complaint I'd like to publicly discuss about. At 0500 hours I walked into a McDonald's. I received horrible service.  After the cashier takes my order I waited 45 minutes for 2 burgers and they messed onther people food in front of me.  The customers looked mad while waiting to show there receipt to the worker who can't even make a food right. They used to have good people but they all got replaced. The cashier who took my order wasn't even wearing the right uniform she looked so lost she messed up ppl food.  This was first time I actually had to wait so much usually I'm in then out in less than 10 which is ok but 45 minutes you lost a customer.</Review>

Chicken nuggets were fresh and delicious. Box brought to me popped open and then to go order of nuggets box was open too. Service was monotone and slow on all to go orders. Drive thru backed up waiting on orders. Disgruntled in drive thru,  threw bbq sauce into window at cashier then came inside complaining wrong sauce was given and drive thru service (cashier) was horrible.</Text>

This place always gets our order wrong!! No matter what time or day it is every single time we have gone they always seem to screw it up we have to drive back many times because there is something missing. One time we went near closing time and headed home than realized we were missing food when we went back they couldn't even fix it or give us what we ordered because they said everything was closed already!! Also the wait is always 20 to 30 min for FAST food.<//Text>

I would recommend every one to not eat this food it been shown to be very unhealthy and lead to unpleasant life instead i would recommend subway or even pollo loco better healthier choice. Try and stay away from animal products youll feel alot better more energy and longer life. God bless ⭐🌈🙏<//text>

Not anymore they have fixed whatever the problem was.   drive-thru is very quick and very accurate.  I'm happy to say they fix the problem?!  thank you McDonald's on Niles!!<//Review></record>

I feel like every time I come to this McDonald's I'm always waiting. Waiting to order, waiting to pay, and waiting to get my food. Sometimes the total amount of waiting can be up to 30 minutes. It's never any different. I dont come here a lot but you would think that at least once I wouldn't be waiting but no....always waiting.< /review>

<review>The drive thru is ALWAYS SO SLOW!  It always takes 20min to order & get food.  Defeats the purpose of "fast food" this particular trip after waiting 23 min I asked if there was bbq sauce in the bag.  The guy at the window asked & reassured me there was.  I looked and saw containers only to get home & have sweet &sour sauce & spicy buffalo sauce.  Neither which my children will eat 😠 I tried calling but no one answers.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Drive thru is horrible. Constantly have to wait 15-25 minutes just for a simple order. Longest I’ve had to wait was 30 minutes from the time I placed order to the time I got my food.</Text>

Absolutely horrible.  Pulled into the drive thru at 11:05. It was 11:35 when we got our food. 30 minutes is ridiculous.  Then when we got it home, we were shorted a burger. Will not be going to this store again!!!< /text>

Good service but they take no pride in the way they serve their food. Looks like they literally slapped my burger together. It was a special request burger. When I unwrapped my burger buns was folded in the wrap and ketchup was spit all over the wrapper.<//Text>

When this McDonald’s first opened everything was great, but now every time I visit this place my order is wrong. Employees seem unhappy and are not friendly, the drive thru line is always ridiculous.

Update

So I gave this place another try AND no one was there....literally! I was at the drive thru for almost 10 min couldn't back out or drive forward because there was cars in back and another in front of me, so I had to yell "HELLO...I'M READY TO ORDER!" Don't bother with this place< /review>

<review>Food is the McDonald's usual which is no problem, but when lunch break is 30 minutes, i wait 10 literal minutes in the drivethru, and a 3 min drive to and from work.....that left less than half my break to eat. Its been this way for almost a year now.< /review><rating>1< /rating><user_name>Cameron Freeborn< /user_name></record>

< Review>
Had to wait 10 minutes for a burger and chicken tenders. They brought our food out to the car (when they ask you to pull into the drive thru parking, it's never good) without so much as a "sorry for the wait".<//Review>

<text>So every Saturday morning I get my kids breakfast at this McDonalds drive thru. 3 Saturdays in a row my order was handed to me with missing food.🤬 and I had to walk back in the restaurant to tell them.. I try to keep my cool but today I had to let them know. With this said I want to say within the last year my order had missing iteams about 8-10 times.. so drive thru goers beware</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80ea4069daf88f5d:0x6aeef45bd029611c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I've gone thru this drive thru a few times hoping I'd have a better experience. This location USED
TO  be fast with good service. Today I was stuck in the drive thru for at least 20 min. I was cut off while placing my order and was told she'll be right back. I was there before the other 3 cars who showed up in the 2nd drive thru row. They were being helped and ended up in front of me while I was still waiting for the girl to come back to complete my order. The employees seemed really stressed and frustrated. I was frustrated but also felt bad for them. This location needs new and better management! The way this location is being operated is not fair to the customers or employees! GET IT TOGETHER!< /Review>< Time>

<review>Horrible service since " new owners" took over. It's 100 degrees today and the ice cream machine is not working. The manager there said they clean the machine every two weeks and she is busy with drive through today and cannot clean it. She said no one else is trained to clean it either.< /review><time>1499814455674</time><user_name>Donna Darling< /user_name><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

There were a few people waiting at an empty cash register. All the employees were busy...no biggie, until the girl walked up to the register after handing a guy his sundaes and tells all of us very rudely.
"You know you can order at the kiosks, but whatever." She then proceeds to ask the people at the register "What do you want?" No joke! I looked at my kid and said "Well we will be getting TacoBell" and walked out. Ridiculously horrible customer service!<//review>< pictures>

Used self service ordering machine. It took my money, but no order processed. Management said she can't do anything, to call my bank to dispute the charges. Will never go back !!!!!!!! Wish I could give negative stars !<//Review>

This place takes way too damn long. I pulled out of line after waiting 15 minutes and DIDNT EVEN MOVE! Once we moved and i was able to get out of line i sure as hell did. Ridiculous. If someone has a huge order that holds up your line you need to ask them to PULL FORWARD! I live right next to it and i have to go to the one on white lane because this one is always packed full of cars and not moving. No iced tea is worth waiting in that! I never complain about places but after experiencing over and over every single time i go there i had to write a review.</Text>

I don't understand why Customer service is never practiced. I would think a huge conpany like McDonalds would teach their employees to , if nothing else, say THANK YOU!!!!</Text>

<review>Been to most McDonald's in town and this is by far the worse in customer service and time. Decided to dine in but regret it. The drive thru was booming and the dine in folks were paying for it, the staff clearly could not handle it. This McDonald's is really mismanaged...< /review>< pictures>
