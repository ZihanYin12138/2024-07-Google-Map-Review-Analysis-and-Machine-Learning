Great spot to see a film. They have table service before the film, kick back chairs. Has an art house feel to it. They have 1st run films. Really worth driving over to Arcata for a movie.< /Text>

<text>A really old theatre with just a touch modern flare. A balcony section and turn of a century ago craftsmanship fully restored, this place could be like stepping into history. It is beautiful. The modern flare is the food fare, with beer & wine, and food served to your seat with a table, it is an experience to be sure. If you havent been there, it is definitely worth checking out</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>Quirky theater that puts every other movie experience to shame. Amazing movies, older classics to the newest blockbuster. They offer beer, popcorn options, and it's all handled by an excellent staff. Check this place out, even if you're just visiting the area! It really demonstrates the charm of Arcata.< /review><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

<Text>The Minor Theatre is a fantastic venue.  It's throwback vibe takes the movie goer right back to cinemas and how they were almost a 75 years ago.  I used to work for this company and if you ever get a chance to visit this theatre in the heart of Arcata, California you will not be disappointed!</Text>< userid>

<Text>I've watched three movies at this location now, and every time the food was good, especially for the price, and the service great. The theater is a beautiful historical one, yet comfortable, and you'll be close to the screen even if you sit at the back because the auditoriums are small. My only complaint is that you cannot access seats from both ends of rows; although, I understand that it's due to the limitations of the original design.< /Text><time>1575394442961<//time><gmapID>0x54d1570fb60da655:0x38e0e486b7ba0fbd< /gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>112429370117823674186<//userid>< username>

Excellent experience!  Great atmosphere (one of the main reasons to come here) as you get to experience film in an older style setting, but with updated seats and amenities.  The second reason to come here is... the beer.  If you love to watch movies, but love those movies even more with a tasty beverage on hand... this is the place to go.  Shoot -- they even still have a balcony!!  How many new theaters today have a balcony?  So... the location is great (sans parking), the staff is great, and being able to sip on a beverage is certainly an added plus and makes even the worst flicks tolerable.  The one gripe I have about this place is that they don't really have any automation built into their ordering system. You basically have to fill out a large card (in the dark) stating what you want, and how much you want... and then you have to calculate the cost and insert the correct cash or a credit card.  You fold the card and stick it in a slot and wait for one of the staff members to notice... and that's the problem.  One night my brother-in-law and I waited for a half hour without any staff coming by, so we just made the trip downstairs ourselves.  On another visit, the staff was right on top of things and spotted the cards right away.  If they had a wireless "ringer" system (where you just punch a "call button" and the staff knows exactly where to go) it would run much smoother.  Until then, I can handle a few hit-or-misses since this is such a great place to watch movies.  Prices are great as well, which I can't say for other theaters.< /text>

<Review>This place used to suck when it was just a corporate-owned place. It got local ownership and it became everything Humboldt needed and wanted in a local theatre. I saw Pulp Fiction here for the first time, and it was awesome, both the film and the theatre. Comfortable seats, great food, awesome atmosphere. The best place to see films anywhere. Simple as that.<//Review>< date>

<Text>Pretty cool experience. Definitely not your regular movie scene. This is a fun place to watch movies in a not so serious setting. People are usually a bit louder than normal theaters and food/drink is served at your seat. Don’t come here if you want to enjoy your movie in peace and quiet.</Text>< UserId.>

<text>Very fun place to see a movie! I love the Reuben hot dog, and the popcorn has actual butter on it. Bar to table service and cushy, reclining seats make the Minor a winner. I'd like the sound systems to be a bit louder, but you can't have it all!< /text>< Pics>

An old playhouse turned state of the art movie theater, it's hard to find a nicer cinema than Minor. The service is always friendly, the food and drink selections are a step above, and the plush seats round out the moviegoing experience. Minor Theatre is truly one of a kind.</Text>

Would be nice if it still felt like a movie theater instead of trying to be a hip college scene. Because of that the movies are an afterthought. "Drink beer, eat empanadas! And while you're at it, why not watch a movie?". An awesome old theater is done and gone. Sadly, they are often the only place around Humboldt showing lesser known movies. So sometimes I have to bite the bullet.

P.S. Don't sit near a door unless you want to hear it open and close endlessly throughout your movie.< /text>

Nostalgic in it's architecture and nicely upkept for being such an old building. Seating is simple and comfortable. Menu is very bare bones and $5 for a pizza slice? Staff doesn't seem to enforce the "no talking" policy like other dinner and a movie chains.  (Alamo Drafthouse)< /Text>

One of the best theatres I have ever been to. It has comfy seats, a unique design with a balcony, and excellent service. The minor theatre also has waiter services to bring concessions. The quality of this theater is something you would expect in a much larger city for a much higher price.</Review>

Seating is great. Projection is pretty good. Food is fine, I wish it was better but it's a theater not a restaurant.

Only gripe is that while some of the staff is great one guy wanted to confiscate my clear and empty water bottle and he wasn't nice about it. The interaction soured the theater experience for me. I usually buy beer/cider, popcorn and a hot dog but I like water too and an eco friendly environment shouldn't have a problem with me filling a small clear plastic bottle at the fountain. Oh well.<//review>

<Text>This is a amazing movie goer experience. Each seat on the ground floor has a table. Plenty of leg room. Balcony available. Limited seating so get there early or prepare for possible sold out. Food available. Drinks. Snacks. A amazing screen. Just amazing. And kid friendly to a degree. A must to see a movie in a very artsy style<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< time>

Love how they serve you while your watching the movie, the tables are amazing and the place is decorated very well. Didn't have to pay for my little brother as he would just sit on our laps which was a huge benefit!< /Text>

We visited the Minor Theater while on vacation. It is a great little theater with a ton of charm and very friendly staff. They have "table service" but I think it's best used for snacks, not meals.  I appreciate their commitment to the environment by using washable cups and bowls, not disposable ones. I highly recommend this fun little theater<//text>

Had our first experience here and it was fantastic! Charming and full of character, seats were comfortable and service was friendly. The spinach and ricotta empanada was lacking salt/flavor, but the crust was flaky and delicious. Popcorn didn't taste fresh, but was decent enough for the price. My spouse had the classic hotdog and said it was great. All in all a good first experience, we will be back!<//Text>

<username>Mira Serrill-Robins< /username><review>This was a very pleasant surprise during a brief visit to the area. It shows a few movies at a time and has a bunch of showings, with some overlap with the McKinleyville movie theater on the first run blockbusters. It has a sort of bar table in front of the seats, and it serves food and drink at the seats, but the offerings are minimal compared to other food-serving theaters I’m used to, specifically Alamo. The drink selections were impressive, with some good options across a variety of types, a coder, and even kombucha on tap. The food was limited—popcorn and packaged goods. The cookies are local. The candy is standard movie theater candy, but I’d think they could charge more for more interesting, local candy. The service seemed to be good and quick. The theater quality was good, not super stadium, but I could see we’ll enough. There were pillars in the main theater on the ground floors, so some seats in the side back would have an obstructed view. That theater had both orchestra and balcony seating. The staff were friendly and helpful. There were maybe 10 minutes or previews, so way better than big chain theaters with 25 minutes of commercials and previews. I had no issues with street parking on a weekday evening.</review><date>1572050990767<//date>< GmapID>

<Text>I wish I could live at the Minor! The seats are super comfy, soft, squishy leather and they recline! The staff serves you food to your seat while you watch the movie! They have adult beverages including local beers, cider and mimosas! They also make root beer floats. They have pizza, hot dogs, and stuff from Humboldt Pie Co. The popcorn is phenomenal as well! Way to go Minor Theatre; you have truly outdone yourself!<//Text>< GmapID>

I am person who regularly goes to shows and listens to loud music but those parts of a movie where the editors certain sounds a bit higher "in the mix" are straight up painful....

This is a minus one star!!!  I came w/ my 7year old grandson, I am always w/ my service dog, a 5 lb. Chihuahua, who has now been assisting me for 8 years.  We were not permitted in because I did not have her portfolio w/ me.    She had her tags on.  If I did not have my grandson w/ me I would of called the police.  I plan to go again soon and hope they deny me so I can close them down, or at least get them fined.< /review>

The movie theater in Humboldt County!  The remodel has breathed new life into this historic building.  I can remember seeing movies here thirty years ago, but the experience and  seating was never this good!      The theaters have large, comfortable chairs with a long counter in front of each row to place your food, which can be ordered from your seats!  Just fill out the order forms,  place them on the counter in front of you with your credit card and an attendant comes by and fills you order.  The prices are reasonable, if not cheaper than other theaters, and this is the only movie theater around that will deliver pizza and beer directly to you seats!  We will be back for our next movie night, and can't imagine going anywhere else!</text>

Advice: if you want to guarantee that you'll get tickets for you and your party, arrive early (not 15 minutes, but an hour or more) to buy tickets as they sell out quickly. You may be able to reserve over the phone, but I am not sure.

The food was mainly regular movie food, but bigger portions and more variety (beer, pizza, hot dogs, etc.). The staff that you order from (using a slip provided inside of the movie theatre) is quick and efficient. Definitely a fun experience, and will be coming back.< /Text>

I've been to the Minor a few times now, and every time has been a great experience! The staff is always friendly and helpful, the theatre is always gleaming, and you can't beat having a beer while watching a movie. I love the classic feel of an old movie theater that comes with the Minor. There are no ridiculous ads before the movie, but local content interested. A true gem of Arcata!< /text>

Perfect place to see a movie! Beautiful building, comfortable seating, friendly people and great food. I honestly think that the Minor Theatre experience can turn a widely reviewed "good" move (e.g. Shazam, Booksmart) into a great one. :)<//text>

<review>Back to the good ol’ days, the minor is the best spot in town to see movies. There are some issues still being worked out, for me the biggest one being that the tables are so high I can’t see part of the screen upstairs, and that the menus are disposable. But their recent efforts show they’re working on reducing waste - including using reusable bowls, cups and paper straws. Half the number of seats were removed to make room for tables and excellent food service. Honestly the food is half the experience as they feature tons of locally crafted food and drink. Get your tickets ahead of time though, they often sell out!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x54d1570fb60da655:0x38e0e486b7ba0fbd</Gmap_id></record>

Staff graciously handled situation w/a couple claiming they had reserved online an entire row of seats, not letting anyone sit in "their" row.   Staff was alerted by a man who had no where else to sit because every other seat was taken.  Staff dealt w/the couple politely  (the row was not theirs)  , "opening up" the row for others  w/out disturbance.< /Text>

I drive here from Eureka because it's authentic movie theater from an age when TV wasn't king.  They have a great staff doing their best and yummy selections for treats!  You get way more than just popcorn.  You can order wraps, and even kombucha!  Highly recommended.< /review>

Normally have a good experience here. Recently had to get up and walk to concessions to order food / drinks  one hour and 15 minutes into  the  film. Understandable when they are busy, but perplexing when there were only 4 customers at that particular screening.  I would have ordered more if someone had only asked.

Edit: been back several times. Had great experience</Text>

Wife kept  telling me again again what my options were for movies.

The movie was great as were all the other REAL people working there. But come on now,  can't you have another option??  Like for left coats or forgotten glasses??<//text>< response>

Perfect theater experience.  They hand-pick their movies, are friendly and the food service is really fun.  A locally owned theater with great pride.  Thank you for saving the Minor----- yet again.</text>

<text>Wish there a few more hot food items to choose from. Maybe nachos or baked pretzels would be good options to add. By far my favorite theatre though! The service is wonderful, the theater is very clean and smells nice, and the bathrooms are imaculate.<//text>< Pictures>

Movie with dinner and craft beer selections delivered to your seat. Fresh-popped popcorn with yeast and local hard cider are my favorites, but you can order a pizza slice, calzones, empanadas, gourmet hot dogs and more. Want a refill? Fill out your order card, put it in the slot on your table and a waitperson will be there almost instantly. Plus, the Minor Theatre is a little piece of Arcata history.<//Review>< name>

Nice theater and seating. Most expensive movie ticket in the area. Ordered a large popcorn, which was terrible. Not to mention being the size of a small popcorn in a chain theater. Ordered a candy bar for 5 bucks. Very overpriced but good. I would go back, but just not order anything.</Review>

This is the only place to see a movie in Humboldt. Tasty treats or fine brews swiftly brought to your table while you recline in the most comfortable theatre seats anywhere. New projection and sound equipment make this a cinephile's treat.</review>

Great theatre, and they bring snacks to you! Good ticket prices and the concessions are about the same price as anywhere, but usually of better quality. Keep an eye on their Facebook page for special run movies. We've seen a few Ghibli anime movies and older ones like Labyrinth.<//text>

<text>Love the new upgrades. It's not the best when you are in the smaller theater and a big movie is playing in the main theater because it could be some time before you get any food service.<//text><userid>104647951728494502837</userid>< name>

I love what they did with the place! It's a little annoying that servers walk past you during the movie, and that you hear everyone's food wrappers being handled, but the seats are spacious and they serve beer now :)< /Review>

<Text>I was sent a random text for an offer of 2 weeks free trial classes. When i accepted within 2 minutes of offer, i was directed to fill a questionnaire because spaces were limited. Part of the questionnaire was why i chose it's facilities, if i saw myself going a minimum of 2x a week, and if i saw myself spending $165 a month.
During this pandemic, not too many people can afford pricey memberships. So my current situation did not see myself enrolling after trials. But that did not mean i would not consider after.
After my responses, i was notified that the trials were not being offered and i would be placed on a wait list.
If that was an attempt to lure me in using a free trial offer, their plan not only failed, but it also cause an unpleasant welcoming.< /Text><userid>111965267625679338585</userid><Date>1605563008564<//Date>< rate>

<Text>10th Planet San Mateo is an awesome place to learn jiu jitsu, and is home to a great community of people.  It's a place where guys and girls from all walks of life come together to progress as grapplers and human beings.  I came in with no grappling experience, but quickly fell in love with jiu jitsu at this gym.  Training at 10th Planet San Mateo is now what I look forward to the most on a daily basis.  Beginners are eased in, and safety is a big priority.  Signing up for this gym was one of the best decisions I've ever made, and I'd highly recommend it to others.</Text>< Pictures>

TL;DR: 5 stars for community, -2 for management shadiness, -2 for safety (bjj + covid). For the full review, see yelp.

A strength of this gym is a large community of dedicated practitioners at a variety of belt levels. The instruction is also good. Alan Sanchez in particular is laid-back, clear, encouraging, and generally a great teacher on top of being an accomplished competitor. If you are focused on mid-peninsula competition no gi jiu jitsu, 10p SM is the place to go.

For my own part, I ended up reluctantly canceling my membership at 10p SM. This is for two main reasons: 1.) a major injury that I suffered, and how it was handled, and 2.) recurring difficulties with the owner, Adam Sachnoff. I wish I'd known about these issues before getting locked into a contract, so that's why I feel compelled to share my experience with you.

First, the story of my injury: about two months into training at 10p SM, my MCL popped so loud people could hear it across the room. I would not be fully healed for four months. That day, I had just submitted my fellow white belt training partner, and rather than slapping hands and rolling again, he got mad. He angrily flung my legs in an awkward, nonsensical direction, and my knee popped. The instructor, rather than setting the tone against such outbursts, had been on his phone the entire time (as was his habit) and did not raise his head even as the much of the class gathered in concern.

I approached the instructors afterwards to see if any good could come from debriefing the incident. Their attitude was, "Sorry, injuries happen in jiu jitsu". Of course that's true to some extent, but it doesn't mean that it's ok to have sloppy revenge injuries in an unsupervised class of white belts. Nevertheless, they didn't change anything, or even say a brief "let's try to be more careful" to the class. As a cherry on top, they went on to promote the perpetrator while I was still out injured.

The most significant issues I ran into with Adam revolved around COVID safety. I have a PhD in Epidemiology and wanted to help the gym, so I approached Adam about donating my time to improve our setup. Nothing that I suggested imposed costs on the gym. If we needed to buy something, I always offered to buy it myself and provide it to the gym for free.

Surprisingly, Adam was not willing to make any changes. He would not allow students to organize into a masks-only training pod. He would not ask the instructors to wear masks to decrease spread between pods. He would not deviate at all from his original plan, which included such knowledgeable attention to detail as "tempature checks" upon entering the gym's "loby". For good measure, he deleted my post on the team page about the benefit of masks.

Later on, I approached Adam again, hoping that a small group of us could train in the gym during off-hours. His conditions for this were that 1.) our masked group had to share the mat with an unmasked group, 2.) we could not bring in fans for ventilation or air filtration, 3.) we would have to pay the full membership price despite not having access to classes. When I said this wouldn't work for me, Adam suggested I train at a different gym.

At this point, I asked Adam for a refund of my remaining training balance so I could pay the fees at the new gym. At first, Adam told me that the money was non-refundable. There was no support for this in the contract. When I politely asked him to consider the many ways his rejection would not hold up, he abruptly agreed to write a check for the requested amount "ASAP". As a final and fitting note, Adam later asked that we chat for 5 minutes before he mailed the check. Rather than trying to end things on a positive note, it turns out that he was trying to negotiate me down on the amount that he had already willingly agreed to in writing. I had discounted over $500 already, so ultimately Adam agreed the requested amount was more than fair, and he issued the refund. He then quietly unfriended me on Facebook.</text>

The instructors teach their little students BJJ techniques, and also lessons important for life: focus, determination and hard work, though, the latter feels like playing games with Adam and crew!

The program is elaborate, with sessions ranging from drills to sparring for kids. It is a relaxed atmosphere and safe for kids.

Through hard work, and learning to challenge themselves, my kids are learning a lot and having fun!</Review><UserId.>117830550963492251732<//UserId.></record>

The number of positive reviews here speaks for itself! I’ve been with the gym a little over 2 years at the moment, and I can truly vouch for all of the praise. I came in with no sports or martial arts experience, but have now been able to walk around much lighter and healthier. Adam and his crew continue to cultivate highly skilled competitors while still prioritizing a very safe and supportive learning environment. His facility is also incredibly clean with tons of supplemental fitness equipment for kids as well as adults. The shower, changing rooms, easy parking, and variety of classes also makes it convenient for training around commute or work. The cheerful community always keeps me coming back. When you decide to come through, feel free to say hello!< /Text>

I’ve been training at 10p San Mateo for a year now and it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Adam and Alan are world class instructors and competitors. They’ve created an awesome environment for growth and development. There’s also many other great people to learn from at the gym, several I consider to be close friends. I’m very pleased with my experience at 10p SM and highly recommend.< /Text>

Amazing school that is like another home. Amazing instructors and teammates that are like family. When lifting weights became monotonous to me, I was seeking a supplemental activity to bolster my workouts. This place shattered expectations and not only elevated my physical fitness, but took me on a more important journey of growing spiritually and mentally. It's provided me with a more positive and forward-thinking mindset, stress inoculation, and increased confidence.

Whether you're looking to compete or simply get a good workout in, this place is for you. The school's curriculum and format caters to anyone who is interested in self-development and personal growth.< /Text>

<Review>I started training last September at 10th Planet San Mateo because I wanted to try something new. I never would have known I'd gain more than just the knowledge of Jiu Jitsu. This gym is like a family; Always welcoming and full of life! I've gained confidence, self-defense techniques, and a handful of friends as well. If you're debating on trying something new, all you need to do is take the first step and tryout a class, you won't regret it!</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Awesome school with very technical instructors. Adam is a world class black belt who is also a great teacher, which is super important because that is not always the case. What I like best about our school is that we are always trying out new types of drills, warm ups, situational sparring, etc. Consistent experimentation in figuring out the best way to learn and progress. Highly recommend!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>10th Planet San Mateo has great instructors (Adam and Allan) and a student base that is skilled and eager to get better (but not headhunting psychos).

This review is long overdue. ^_^  My son and daughter (mini-jitsu program) both train at 10th Planet JJ in San Mateo. They were brand new to BJJ when they started at 10th Planet. They have grown a lot over the year in terms of their confidence, discipline, and toughness.

Before I joined I was really worried about finding a place that had a good balance between being "good with kids" while not sacrificing the quality and rigor of teaching an effective martial art.  The instructors are hands down the absolute best you're going to find. Tony, Ian, Adam...the whole staff is caring, patient, and disciplined. They treat each kid with respect and adjust lessons to their levels so everyone feels included.  They're also all laid back and down to earth as well.

Overall an amazing place to learn, play, and improve yourself for all ages.  If you're looking for a place for your kids to learn BJJ - 10th Planet in San Mateo should be top of your list.</Text>

<Text>I checked out eight different schools when I moved to the Bay Area before finally settling on 10th Planet San Mateo.  I'm on the smaller side, and have typically chosen schools with smaller instructors in the past, but Adam, Saad, and the other teachers are great at showing moves that everyone can use, and providing modifications if necessary.  There are also a fair number of other girls that train here, and everyone is very welcoming.  The kickboxing classes are taught by a true fighter and are fantastic as well.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I am so fortunate to have this gym near my house.  Adam is a world class instructor (check out his resume) and has such a great attitude and gift for teaching.  Everyone is welcoming and the support and help from all belts is amazing.   Beware!  You will become an addict if you join this gym.  You won't want to miss class.</Review>

I began doing jiu jitsu here because I was overweight and I couldn't get excited to go to the gym anymore.  I'm also a big MMA nerd so it interested me.  It's been very fun learning all of the techniques and the coaches and students have all been friendly and welcoming.  I'm down about 12 pounds and look forward to losing even more.< /review>

When I first started my journey into Jiu Jitsu I had bounced around a few gyms trying to find the perfect fit. Within minutes of my first class at 10th Planet San Mateo I knew immediately that my search was over. From the time you start your intro with instructor and GM Ian Sulcer you get your first glimpse of how phenomenal the training and instruction is in this facility. Once you move into class, you're surrounded by so many others hungry to become stronger, better, and healthier versions of themselves as fighters and as people. Sensei and gym owner Adam Sachnoff goes above and beyond every day with the help of his team to ensure each student is not only learning but growing, whether you're a world class fighter or it's your first day, they're willing to break down every technique step by step to make sure you know what you're doing and more importantly WHY you're doing it, which was what I noticed and really appreciated from day 1. In only 6 months of training I've learned so much about myself and I've grown to love Jiu Jitsu so much that it's now one of the most important parts of my life and will continue to be in the future. I've gotten stronger, fitter, more flexible and confident, and my stress levels are at all-time lows, all thanks to the crew at 10th Planet San Mateo. I can honestly say now my training sessions at 10th Planet San Mateo are what I look forward to most every day! If you're curious about learning Jiu Jitsu, Kickboxing or wrestling I cannot recommend this facility enough. Come see for yourselves or in the words of Master Eddie Bravo..."Look into It".< /text>

<Review>I found 10p San Mateo after moving here from New York and looking for a new place to continue on my jiu-jitsu journey, and from the minute I walked in I felt like I was a part of the family. No matter the age or experience, I’ve gotten to know and train with so many great people, and my knowledge and technique has continued to improve with every class. Can’t thank Adam, Ian, Alan, and everyone else for providing such an awesome environment, and I hope anyone reading this decides to stop in and give 10p jiu-jitsu a shot!</Review><Name>Alex Baum<//Name>< GmapID>

<Name>Frank Chen<//Name><text>I've been coming to 10th Planet San Mateo for approximately 2.5 years.

Great community, quality instruction, and great learning experiences are a few of the reasons why I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. Hat tip to Adam, Alan, Gregor, Ian, and all of the other un-mentioned instructors at our school - they go the extra mile for the students.

Because of our community, jiujitsu has morphed from a casual curiosity into a lifetime obsession. Physically, it helped me build functional strength, flexibility, and cardio. Mentally, it's boosted my confidence, helped me reconnect with flow states, and trained me to solve complex problems under pressure. These are skills that are highly applicable in and outside of the mats.

If you're on the fence, give it a shot. You won't regret it.</text></record>

<text>Great coaching and instruction (sensei Tony and Ian are legit!). My daughter Ava has been attending ever since they started the 4-7 yr old kids class and she loves it! She has done bball, gymnastics, tap, ballet, karate, kuksoolwon, swimming, in additional to BJJ. By far BJJ (and gymnastics) is her favorite. She loves 10th planet so much that she always stays for the next class of older kids just to watch.</text><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Before I joined 10th Planet San Mateo I researched a couple of gyms. Most didn't offer a warm up, and dove right into the technique. The instructor stood around after not really doing much. Then I discovered 10th Planet. Not only do we have a warm up for the body, but we also have warm ups for the technique which are super important for a sport like jiujitsu. What impressed me the most is the level of instruction Adam provides. He breaks down techniques to their core, explain's why they work, and how to counter those same techniques! In other gyms you simply drill the technique and if you're lucky you'll get a little theory as to why they work. I think the most valuable aspect of Adam's teaching is how he builds on a technique. We spend an entire month on a technique so that it gets into our muscle memory. No we don't drill the same "move" all month long. What we do is build from that move, say back takes, we drill an aspect of the back take one week, and . then move to a different aspect the next. And unlike other gyms where the instructor does nothing, Adam and the other coaches go around and actually help you out with the  techniques. The give you instant feedback and instant correction. If you've never done any time of martial arts don't worry! At 10th Planet San Mateo, they break down the class into sections - intro, beginner, advance. You'll be well taken care of. No matter what your goal is, compete, get in shape, self-defense etc. 10th Planet San Mateo and the high quality instruction will help you meet them!

I have to say that as one of the smaller females in the gym, I have never felt so safe training. I've trained at other gyms before, but the physical safety and secure I've experience here keeps me coming back. That and the friendships I've built with everyone. Come give us a try!< /review></record>

<review>So, since I always end up thinking too much and rewrite my words until I end up with an blank page again, which isn't very helpful for reviews, I'll go with a stream of consciousness approach.  Get ready for words...

It's taken some time to recognize the different ways that jiu jitsu has impacted my life, and I think the main reason for that, and why it seems so difficult to put into words, is because of how much it changed.  I barely recognize the person I was before starting jiu jitsu.  It has made me feel comfortable being inside my own body, mentally and physically.

I started out at the recommendation of my wife after being frustrated with being unable to manage it through time at the gym alone (also, I hated going to the gym).  I was vaguely aware of what jiu jitsu was before attending my first class, but the main appeal was that it was something different, and that there was no striking involved.  I had never done a forward roll before, let alone a backwards one, and I had never even thought about learning how to break my fall, or how to then stand up in a technically correct way.  How did I get up from the floor before?  Probably pretty awkwardly.  It also made me realize just how completely helpless and incapable I was at defending myself, even in a controlled environment.  How are you supposed to escape from a person that is on top of you?

Practicing self defense was never the intention, but neither was meeting new people.  I had no idea of the extended community I was joining and how welcoming it would turn out to be.  While going to the gym I might be surrounded by random people, here didn't have that same uncomfortable feeling.  Not that I would be remembering many names for a while, but there was more of a sense of camaraderie in knowing that everyone was once where I was, and that they were there to help guide me through motions that I didn't yet know I was capable of making.  Learning how to do things less badly slowly over time, Adam and the other instructors were always there to make adjustments during training and offer support and feedback along the way.

I can't imagine not doing jiu jitsu at this point.  Now a few years later, having to scramble and move because otherwise I'm going to be trapped underneath the big guy has enabled me to surpass my physical fitness goals (dropping from 225 to 185), but more often it just helps as a form of stress relief and mental reset--which might seem strange, but when being choked with only a few seconds of consciousness left, things are put into a clearer perspective.<//review>< Pictures>

An uplifting and safe environment to learn A++ jiu jitsu and kickboxing. I started 2 years ago after NEVER having heard of it! I felt welcomed from day 1. I've learned so much about myself, about jiu jitsu, and lost 20+ lbs in the process.

Reasons why you should go:
+ safe environment (esp for women)
+ friendly and respectful training partners
+ no bs, no politics
+ get fit and have fun doing it
+ make life long friends/family
+ get humbled af

If you're on the fence, just take one intro class and then decide :)< /text>

<Text>I had been interested in trying Jiu Jitsu for a few years but wasn't sure if it would really be for me. I finally took the plunge and came to 10th Planet San Mateo because of their reputation for training/teaching No Gi BJJ. As is the case for many like me, I am now fully addicted! If anything I wish I had more time during the week to dedicate to training. My experience so far has been fantastic. I came to 10th planet with no significant martial arts background and for someone like me learning BJJ can be intimidating and overwhelming at first. But, the instructors and the students at 10th Planet have all been welcoming, patient, encouraging, and friendly. Each session I learn something new, improve, struggle, get humbled, gain confidence, gain fitness, gain flexibility, and leave wanting more! It might not be for everyone in the end, but if you are interested in BJJ and looking for a great place to train with great people I'd highly recommend 10th Planet San Mateo.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Text>This is my second BJJ school. It works good for me for different reasons. 1. Week long theme in technique. I have chance to remember and drill through details (I'm not a gifted grappler and it take time for me). 2. Techiques usually taught in pairs with counter. This is great for trying it in rolls. 3. Situational sparring from position being drilled to try apply it in practice. 4. Open mat with practically unlimited rolls after class. 5. No gi. I like no gi much better, because it is dynamic. 6. Adam has assistants, higher belts, that look after student and ready explain, answer question or fix you. Definitely worth checking out.</Text><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

Excellent grappling instruction for novice and advanced students. Adam is a world class  BJJ instructor, always providing sufficient attention to all students to ensure the techniques are taught correctly. Additionally, the culture of 10P San Mateo is welcoming and friendly to drop ins and novices, I immediately felt comfortable even though I had no prior athletic experience.<//Review>

Great school. Great instruction. I just wish they played music while rolling. I prefer some smooth jazz. Clarinet solos pair well with darse chokes, maybe some Chet Korea with my donkey guard. A little Kenny G would go a long way, so for that reason I am only giving 10th Planet San Mateo a rating of 4.6. Luckily for them, this rounds up to five stars. More smooth jazz please. And remember, the customer is always right.<//Review>

There are number of classes offered throughout the week to fit your schedule: morning classes for early risers and afternoon classes that are perfect during your lunch break, along with evening classes. Door is also open over the weekend and there's kickboxing as well! All levels are welcome so don't hesitate to call Adam.< /Text>

<review>I've been coming to Big Red's training center (10PSM) for nearly a year now. After separating from the military 2.5 years prior, I was as out of shape as I had ever been (207 lbs). Also, I was uninformed and inexperienced in the realm of the Jiu Jitsu world. Thankfully, I walked into this gym and the rest is history. After 11 months of training under Adam "Big Red" Sachnoff, morning instructor Alan Sanchez, Kickboxing coach Kenya Prach, and Thursday coach Adam Piccolotti,  I am in the best shape I have ever been (160 lbs).  The motto at 10PSM (taught by Big Red) is to train hard and stay consistent. No matter what your goals are (weight loss, competition, learning Jiu Jitsu, networking, making new friends etc.), this establishment provides the tools necessary to achieve them all. World Class instruction, Cleanliness, Organization, Friendliness, Diversity, Professionalism. I could go on for days, 10th Planet San Mateo is hands down the best gym in the bay area!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>I always considered myself an athletic person and wanted to get back into shape by combining a lot of different things (cardio, resistance training, and stretching my mental prowess) and doing any sort of martial arts can be a daunting task.  Combine that with being a woman in a male-dominated sport, and it was downright debilitating. But not 10th Planet San Mateo.

I was immediately accepted by everyone. I've taken early morning, afternoon, and evening classes and you will see a lot of familiar faces.

The atmosphere is always about pushing yourself to get better in technique and making sure to take care of yourself. If you're not feeling good, Adam is really understanding.

It really feels like the best kind of family to have.

Also, Kenya's kickboxing classes are 2nd to none!</Review>< userid>

I started training jiu jitsu with my 8yr old son two years ago and have become hooked on this sport. We were super fortunate to find Adam Sachnoff - a world class jiu jitsu competitor and coach in San Mateo. Adam has developed a superb team culture for kids and adults at his gym and I highly value and appreciate the friendships I’ve developed there. Jiu jitsu is by far the most challenging and rewarding sport I’ve ever tried (it develops coordination, balance, flexibility, cardio endurance, strength and mental stamina). Check out 10th Planet San Mateo and Red Training Center to meet and train with great people.</text>

10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu is HANDS DOWN the BEST gym in the Peninsula!!!!! Head Instructor, Adam "Big Red" Sachnoff, is a not only a highly decorated competitor (having one a gold medal at the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation's World Championship amongst many other prestigious tournament wins) but also a GREAT teacher. He is really nice, funny, approachable, and easy going so he is awesome with complete beginners as well as advanced jiu-jitsu students; he is also a really good instructor to children as the kids' program is doing very well. Adam has a way of communicating details to EVERYONE so that no one is lost during class.

You won't find a better training environment in any other gym as EVERYONE is very friendly and welcoming of all those who come in. It is a  perfect gym for literally ALL WALKS OF LIFE. It doesn't matter if you're old, over-weight, out of shape, or any combination of the 3; it doesn't matter if you're a collegiate athlete in phenomenal shape; it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman: this gym accommodates EVERYONE with all sorts of backgrounds.

No matter what you're looking for in jiu-jitsu you will find it here. If you want a fun and challenging way to get in shape rather than just running on a treadmill and/or lifting you should definitely try it out. If you're looking to compete in jiu-jitsu tournaments you should definitely check it out as the competition team is FIERCE.

Regardless of why you want to try jiu-jitsu and what you're looking to get out of it you will definitely find it at 10th Planet San Mateo!</Text>

I ordered for extra mean for my chicken bowl and they gave the normal size portion of chicken. I would like my money back. Also it was delivered by Uber eats. And the chicken is very chewy like gum. Pray I don’t get Salmonella.<//Review>

< Review>
It's a standard WaBa. The food is always fresh and full of their signature sauce. I like the WaBa bowl (chicken and beef) the best.

Thanks to Covid the indoor seating is unavailable, but there are tables you can eat at.

Parking is usually challenging in that little corner, so I would recommend parking a little further out by the back side of the Golden Corral and just walking a few aisles over.< /Review>

The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the costumer service is good but the meat, specifically the steak ugh ! It's more FAT THAN MEAT !!! I ordered a veggie bowl with steak and 70% of the meat was pure FAT. I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back.

Thank you wabagrill for replying to this post. This shows you guys look out for your costumers concerns and opinions.< /review>

<review>Buyer beware! I'm not sure why, but the person at the register was calculating the price on a calculator as opposed to the register, and then double charged me the tax. When I told her about it, she said "I wouldn't short you, I'm not like that". And I agree she wouldn't, but why overcharge me then? This place needs help. $10.50 for an $8.99 bowl is just not correct. And of course I get no receipt.<//review>< Pictures>

Try and find a healthier place to find fast food. Salmon with a kale salad is the way to go if you're looking for a fast service. Other than this the chicken bowls are pretty standard.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) VERY BAD EXPERIENCE THE CASHIER THAT OBIOUSLY COLLECTS AND HANDLES MONEY
SHE IS THE ONE THAT SERVES YOU THE FOOD AND I TOLD HER THAT THIS IS NOT VERY HYGIENIC AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE MANAGER OR THE DUENA AND INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING OR APPEALING, SAID TO ME THAT IN ALL WABAS THE CASE IS THE SAME THAT SERVES THE FOOD
X MY PART WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE

(Original)
MUY MALA EXPERIENCIA LA CAJERA QUE OBIAMENTE COBRA Y MANEJA DINERO
ES LA QUE TE SIEVE LA COMIDA Y LE DIJE QUE ESO NO ES MU HIGIENICO Y NO SE SI ERA LA MANAGER O LA DUENA Y EN LUGAR DE DISCULPARSE O APENARSE ME DIJO QUE EN TODOS LOS WABAS ES IGUAL LA CAJERA ES LA QUE SIRVE LA COMIDA
X MI PARTE JAMAS VUELVO A ESE LUGAR< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I feel to have truly been blessed to come into contact with Carrie and any others from Evans-Brown they were all so kind and helpful at any given time. Carrie did most of the care for my sweet baby boy and she did so with so much genuine love, care and respect. Through out the entire process she kept me up to date with every detail and made the planning so much less stressful for me. I could not have asked for a better team and I can not thank them enough.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Evans-Brown Mortuary was wonderful to our family! Carrie did an exceptional job in handling all of our needs. She was there day and night for us to answer any questions, or simply just to give comfort during a very sad time. I feel they went above and beyond during an especially busy time with the pandemic! Four months later they still check in with us, to see how we’re doing and give words of comfort. Truly an exceptional job.I would highly recommend them!</Review>< Gmap_id>

We couldn’t have asked for better. She and everyone we interacted with was warm, kind and helpful. Carrie told us my mother was now in her care, and would remain in her care. We were so comforted that my mom wouldn’t be passed around to random people. Mom was treated with respect and dignity. Carrie explained her role and made sure we understood what was going to happen every step of the way. When we called Evans-Brown, a human being always answered the phone. It’s just a small thing that makes a huge difference. I recommend them without reservation. We won’t hesitate to use their services again, hopefully not for a long time.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc9e3d9d30c8b1:0x3b26a70b4ca79de4</gmap_id></record>

< review>
The last thing you want to worry about when you lose a loved one is dealing with insurance companies, finances, burials, etc.  I called Evans-Brown Mortuary during some very tough times.  Carrie answered my call.  She was kind, answered all my concerns / questions and set up a meeting with me for the very next day.  During the meeting, she basically walked me through everything, taking her time, while making sure I was satisfied with the services they would be providing.  Their services were professionally done, on time and exactly as was described to me during the initial meeting. Days after, I received texts messages from Elizabeth and Carrie, simply to ask how I was doing and if there was anything else they could do.  With all the people they help on a daily, I thought sending a random text message just to check on how I was doing went far and beyond their job requirement.  I would recommend Evans-Brown Mortuary without hesitation.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>The Evans-Mortuary Team led by Justin has been extraordinary.  We lost our father in December of 2020.  His passing was unexpected and shocking for our family... to say the least.  As well, due to CV19 back log and his final wishes, the experience with our Dad is/was not ordinary.

Nonetheless, Evans Mortuary has proven to be patient, kind, understanding, and caring.  The team has proven to be everything we needed, though we didn't know what our needs were; initially.  It's hard to process the emotions of knowing your loved one is gone forever... yet, Evans Mortuary has aided us in moving forward in our next phase of life.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Evens-Brown Mortuary has handled my 2 Children that passed my 4 year old 26 years ago an recently my oldest.  Evans-Brown Mortuary is as compassionate and caring as they were 26 years ago.  Kimberly the funeral director is amazing.  She is so genuinely caring and all the staff.  When Kimberly was not available they were able to assist with same care.  I would highly recommend Evans-Brown Mortuary.  Also I really appreciated how I did not feel like I was being upcharged in any way.  They accommodated my financial situation the best they could.  Thier pricing is very competitive.</Review>

<review>I lost my Mother in early January 2021.  Everyone at Evans-Brown Mortuary was so compassionate and helpful during a difficult time.  They did the same when my Dad passed several years ago.  This past year has been extremely stressful and difficult for all working at the Mortuary but they never stopped doing everything possible to help eveyone who had lost a loved one.  They have remained in touch with me to assure that I am doing well and to see if there is anything way they can assist me.  I highly recommend them.<//review>< response>

< review>
I lost my Mother in early January 2021.  Everyone at Evans-Brown Mortuary was so compassionate and helpful during a difficult time.  They did the same when my Dad passed several years ago.  This past year has been extremely stressful and difficult for all working at the Mortuary but they never stopped doing everything possible to help eveyone who had lost a loved one.  They have remained in touch with me to assure that I am doing well and to see if there is anything way they can assist me.  I highly recommend them.< /review>

<review>Evens-Brown Mortuary has handled my 2 Children that passed my 4 year old 26 years ago an recently my oldest.  Evans-Brown Mortuary is as compassionate and caring as they were 26 years ago.  Kimberly the funeral director is amazing.  She is so genuinely caring and all the staff.  When Kimberly was not available they were able to assist with same care.  I would highly recommend Evans-Brown Mortuary.  Also I really appreciated how I did not feel like I was being upcharged in any way.  They accommodated my financial situation the best they could.  Thier pricing is very competitive.< /review>< pictures>

My very special thank you goes out to Justin and Elizabeth of Evans-Brown. Their professionalism and caring during this time made it very easy to take care of the important task at this sad time. My family and I are grateful for making it easier to do. We would recommend this company to any one needing their help.</Review>

At the unexpected and tragic loss of my husband, I had no idea what to do or who to turn to. A friend referred me to Evans Brown Mortuary. The compassion and consideration Desiree showed me when I was confused and sad helped me move forward to make the correct decisions for my family.
I was treated with respect in all interactions with the mortuary, and never felt as if they were trying to “upsell” me or convince me to purchase something I didn’t want.
While death isn’t  a topic most people want to talk about, I highly recommend Evans Brown and especially Desiree.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>After my mother passed (at 104) it’s the responsibility of the family and to make the correct decision for services.
After looking at other options we decided on Evans Brown in Sun City (Menifee).
From the our first visit it was evident we made the perfect choice.
Kim assisted us with everything.  During these times it can be confusing not knowing exactly where to start.
Kim sat with us and I was amazed at how efficiently this was handled. We gave her information and she would just put everything together.
Kim was out of town during the service and Desiree came to help us.  Again it was amazing how smooth everything went.
I cannot recommend a funeral home more highly than Evans Brown in Sun City.
A special thanks to father Bob for doing a great job speaking at the service.

<review>The gracious folks at Evans-Brown made making funeral arrangements much easier than it might have been. Carrie was at all times professional and extremely helpful and, at the same time, empathetic and loving. Carrie was always available to talk with me or help me in any way she could. Carlos represented Evans-Brown at my Dad’s graveside service. Carlos, at all times, conducted himself with dignity and respect. To Carrie, Carlos and the others at Evans-Brown, thank you so very much, from the family of C.B. Lewis!</review>< response>

A couple months ago my wife past away on the East Coast and I had her flown back to Evans-Brown Mortuary.

She also made herself available for us whenever we needed and was able entertain all requests. Thank you for your comfort and commitment to make sure everything was perfect.< /Text>

When my mom passed away on 10/10/2020 I was completely lost, I didn’t know what to do or who to call so that I could make arrangements for my mom. I reached out to my cousin and he made arrangements for Evans and Browns to pick up my mom, Carlos reached out to me and ensured me that my mom would be in great hands, they did just that, he handled everything for me and it’s weird to say but in a way it comfort me and I highly recommend that you use them for your loved ones. On 10/29/2020 I lost my sister and again Carlos was there for me and my family and we knew that she would be in good hands! Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts!!<//Text>

<text>After researching & visiting several mortuaries, prior to our loved one's death, we found Evans-Brown to be the most friendly and accommodating at a reasonable price.  Due to the pandemic, we were unable to be there, but it was nice to be able to trust them to do an excellent job.  There were out-of-state issues and they took care of all the details with professionalism and kindness.</text><GmapID>0x80dc9e3d9d30c8b1:0x3b26a70b4ca79de4</GmapID>< date>

Evans and Brown Mortuary provided excellent service during a difficult time. Justin helped me make decisions about my husband’s funeral and showed compassion, kindness, and was very professional from start to finish.

Everything was handled with the sensitivity and ease needed in the difficult area of death. The day we had to come and sign off on documents, select a casket, and complete everything was very difficult.  But I never felt rushed, prodded, or like it was business as usual.  All the logistical items were clear, and they took the time to explain everything in detail.  They definitely took our feelings and emotions seriously and that was very much appreciated.

Evans and Brown Mortuary Services showed great respect and care throughout. When I needed anything, Justin was there and very responsive and provided the information right away. No hoops to jump through, or multiple calls to make. I can’t even thank them enough.  If your wanting care and that white glove service then choose this funeral home, because they will go that extra mile.  I highly recommend them.

Thank you! You all truly made a difference during such a difficult time.

<Review>Nothing but care and professionalism. Losing a family member is difficult enough, but knowing that your family member is treated with care and respect after they die is a comforting thing. James and the entire staff at Evans-Brown Mortuary made this difficult process more manageable. Any question or concern I had was thoughtfully addressed, and after the process was over they reached out to me to check in how I was doing after some time had passed. Know that your loved one and you and your family will be well taken care of by the staff at Evans-Brown Mortuary.</Review>< UserId.>

On August 6, I went to a funeral for a family member, Ernest.  We were at the chapel early in the morning,  and a nice bald man opened the door for me and the guests who arrived at 8am. The mother of Ernest was in shock seeing her son, was so sad. The Evan's Brown employee was so nice to all of us. Opening the front doors as we walked in, walking us to the bathroom, even asking us if we needed anything to let him know. He was so nice and caring. I dont know his name, just was a bald white, younger man. Everyone who helped this day was nice too, at the chapel, and cemetery.
It's been hard without my uncle,  we miss him a lot, but wanted to write this to Evan's brown. Nice people there.

Thank you

In my time of sadness, with the loss of my aunt, Desiree, at Evans-Brown Mortuary, was just the person I needed. I was feeling very lonely, going through all of it by myself. Desiree was very patient, understanding, and helpful, as she respectfully steered me through the process that I was not ready to face. Looking back, Desiree was a bright light in a very dark time.< /Review>

They are all so professional and knowledgeable and great people too. The printed brochure got many compliments thanks to Desiree and Danette. The thank you card got many compliments too. Maurice directed the service perfectly. The space for dining was intimate and just what we needed for our service. I recommend this organization and would work with them again although I hope it's not necessary.<//text><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

< Review>
Carrie and staff were so pleasant and kind from the moment we walked in the door. They are all so professional, caring while they helped me through each decision that had to be made during one of the most difficult
incomprehensible times in my life that I was not ready for at all, the passing of my husband at the age of 58. I can not express in words how thankful to have such caring guidance during the planning and the weeks after that they continued to send a notes of concern and prayers as I needed.

Sincerely thank you,
Cindy Ebberts<//Review>

<review>Gary and the Staff at Evan's Brown are amazing. They all go above and beyond right from the beginning. Once you have entrusted your loved one into their care you will have no worries only peace of mind. The staff is very caring, compassionate and very professional. I would definitely recommend Evan's Brown for you funeral needs.<//review>< user>

When everything else around us seemed chaotic and out of control, Carrie simplified what we needed to focus on and showed us options we previously had no knowledge of.  It was comforting to know that everything was being handled professionally and all the proper documentation was being processed. At a time when we were not capable of learning all that was needed, Evans Brown took care of everything.<//Review><Response>None</Response></record>

<Review>My parents made their arrangements with Evans Brown when they lived in Sun City.  When they passed at separate times they lived in Orange County. From the very beginning everything was taken care of to make sure our concerns & experience was treated with the utmost care. Everyone was compassionate
& checked in with us to see how we were & if there was anything else they could do.  Thank you Kim
& Elizabeth, our family appreciates the special care,
we feel you gave us.< /Review>< pictures>

My mother passed unexpectedly while I was out of town.  The hospital transferred her to Evans Brown.  I met with Carrie and she was so kind and professional.  She listed with empathy to our story.  She explained, very calmly what they would be able to do for us.  Her peacefulness and kindness made a tough time very bearable.  She was not pushy with items to sell.  She gave me what I wanted, including ideas and tips to meet our wishes.  She was the person who groomed and readied my mom for her entombment out of the area.  She arranged for my mom to be transported to her final place of rest.  She followed up with communication--just to check on me.  My mom was driven in a beautiful limo and the drivers were so kind also.  It has not only been Carrie, but Kim who gave me final documents, again listened and cried with me.  I would highly recommend and thank them!!< /Review>< rating>

<Text>We accidentally went to Evans-Brown Mortuary for the service for our uncle's funeral because we initially were referred to another one nearby. However, this accident turned out to be a great experience and we decided to use Evans-Brown Mortuary instead. Carlos gave us a very good impression for his friendliness and honesty. The funeral service and the cremation ceremony were well and respectfully prepared. The chapel is nice even for us, a Buddhist family. Thank you Carlos for all of your help.</Text>< time>

They are efficient and caring, making sure all of my mother's last arrangements were handled seamlessly, with as little stress on us as possible. I could tell they are experienced. I'm so grateful for the care that my mother and the rest of my family received at Evans-Brown Mortuary. They helped us compile a beautiful slide show that I would never have been able to put together without their user friendly website. I highly recommend Evans-Brown.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>115160685517448403985< /user_id>< response>

<Review>My husband, age 71, died suddenly on Christmas Day.  It was a total shock as he’d had EKG & Cardiac Stress tests prior to cataract surgeries in September & October.  His heart was deemed fine and yet he died of cardiopulmonary arrest.  The good news is that he didn’t suffer at all.  The bad news is that he’d made no provisions for his demise.  My stepdaughter and I dealt with Carrie, at Evans Brown.  She could not possibly have been more considerate, patient or helpful.  It’s never a pleasant experience in having to deal with the death of a loved one but Carrie made it far less onerous than it could have been.  Mortuaries are not generally something that we go shopping for but if you’re faced with that awful situation, I guarantee that Carrie will make it far easier to deal with.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I found Evans Brown on the internet and called Justin in the middle of the night when my dad passed away. He answered all my questions and sent someone out to pick my dad up. He was helpful throughout the entire process. From planning the service to picking up my dad's ashes Evans Brown was there for us all the way. I have to also commend Pastor Bob who did the service for us. We met him at the mortuary the morning of the service and even though we had never met before he did a fantastic job.<//text>

I was very pleased with the funeral plan as discussed with your area sales representative, Nancy Lapointe. I would have given her 5⭐'s, but I would have really liked to have gotten a color brochure describing your Sun City mortuary. I received plenty of information otherwise on Homesteaders Life Insurance, the underwriters of my funeral policy. A color brochure of Evans-Brown Mortuary in Sun City seemed a vital link to the presentation.</text>

On behalf of the families, friends and relatives of the late Earl Velasco Guarnes, thank you for the dedicated professionalism and heartfelt compassion you extended to us throughout this grievous ordeal. You only get one chance to get it done right for a newly deceased loved one in need of your company's services and we are so blessed that your Carrie Bayer was so amazingly up to the challenge; each detail of every arrangement that needed doing was meticulously prepared and executed. Kudos also to Fr. Bob Rockwell whose compassionate words helped bring spiritual solace and closure to all present during the service.

I gladly offer you my sincere gratitude, my high recommendation, and my deep respect for the spot on job. You were exactly what we needed.

The pizza has a distinct flavor but that is what makes it special. It's my favorite pizza out of all pizzas in San Jose. Their pizzas don't make me bloated or feel tired like all other places. Their prices are a little on the higher side but it's worth paying for. If you want pizza to enjoy with a beer to celebrate or just because this is the place.<//text>

The best pizza, period. My parents were eating here before I was born, I'm over 50. It's very hearty pizza, i would consider it Sicilian style pizza. Not the best neighborhood, but always worth the trip. The attached pic shows a medium combo and a mini salami.<//review>

This pizza is the best. They are not greedy with the toppings or cheese. I always order the bull fighter which is spicy and delicious. I always recommend this place to everybody. Commercial places have nothing on this place!</Review>

< review>
Terrible Pizza!!! I notice a lot of the people who have given this place 4 or 5 stars have been acquainted with the location since childhood. It's possible that nostalgia has a lot to do with the rating because the pizza is horrendous. For the price, you should get a mainstream pizzeria pizza.
The pizza is very doughy and it has minimal sauce. The toppings don't mix! They look just like the pictures on the images tab and they run off and just leave a flavorless dough behind. I've eaten here twice and have been disappointed twice! The people who linger in the area are less than savory as well,  and I just recommend you avoid the spot...< /review>

I guess I go to Renatos Pizza because it brings back a lot of childhood memories!  Like when the Green parrot used to be next-door was some crazy fights back in the days in this pizza place!  The pizza quality  not the same like when Mr. Renato himself owned it.  Their customer service definitely needs help  nowadays they can be a little bit rude!!! I will  from time to time go grab something to eat there!  Not expecting too much with customer service  or quality of food the pizzas I guess just OK. Maybe if  they would work on their attitude  their food would  probably taste  a little  better!< /Text>

<Review>The service was the worst I have ever experienced. Had to ask if they were open. She checked the clock like she didn’t want to make the pizza. We walked in at 8:30 and they closed at 10. Just asked “what we wanted” with our giving us a menu. I asked for a beer and again, “what do you want.” I don’t know where’s your beer list, how do I know? It was terrible. The pizza however isn’t that bad. Little sweet for my taste. I have never felt so unwelcome and confused.< /Review>< pics>

My Parents used eat pizza here in the 70's. I've been coming here since the 80's. Ownership has changed however the recipe has been the same. In my opinion this is the best pizza in San Jose. Check these guys out you have never tasted pizza like this.<//Text>

I have been coming to Renato's since the early 70's when Renato himself made and served your pizza.  Simply put there is no comparison to this great pizza! Their crust has a sweet taste like no other. Most crust are pretty boring elsewhere, not at Renato's. I love the fact that all the ingredients are placed under the cheese. Our family comes all the way from South San Jose to eat pizza here, no other establishment compares.<//text>

Mr. Renato would complain to my dad about his cheap son in-law (49ers) I can't remember his name.

Good pizza. And looks pretty clean. But dayummm. Horrible. Service. All of them. On a horrible mood. You can't ask for anything. Because they'll bark at you. I can't say is the best pizza. It's pretty. Good. But before I eat. It is have to fight with the cooks. To be more polite.  The< /review>

CONS: No public restroom, Sub-par customer service, Steep price for the quality of pizza. Half the ingredients on the pie were ok, the other half was barely covered in any sauce whatsoever, overly spicy sausage that was fine, but didn't mesh at all with the other toppings, aaaaaaand last but not least OMG! WHY IS THE CRUST SWEET! As if shortening or something was in the actual dough itself. The texture was close to that of store-bought cookies. Bugs me that I paid 30+ dollars for mediocre pizza. Somebody put the pizzas on a leash, they're running wild.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>117651003900726803332</user></record></dataset><record>

It's one of the best local pizza joints around but it could be THE best. I've been eating this pizza since I was in the womb. Anyone remember when the Old Italian owner would hang out with patrons? Autographed 49er memorabilia on the wall. The Green Parrot was still open then. The place used to be packed. Music blasting, beer flowing, arcade room. Nostalgia. Combo was to die for!!! Juices soaked through the pizza box. Every bite was pure spicy chorizo bliss.
Then the owner passed and his daughter took over. You no longer saw the same faces baking. Renovations took place, flavor changed (price didn't). Corners were cut. Less sauce.
Yes, the dough is still sweet. The combo doesn't have that kick to it anymore. But I still consider it the King of Pizza.<//text>

Good food, good price. Nice San Jose interpretation of Italian favorite...chorizo, yum.

Restaurant is a little divey, but that doesn't stop us from going time and time again.

Enjoy.< /text>

The food was okay, slightly below average. The restaurant was clean, but outdated and somewhat worn. The staff was friendly.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The taste of pizza bread is delicious, just one detail, its charging system needs updating, it is slow and they do not have Google pay and if you forget to take a card, we can no longer pay with the cell phone

This place is absolutely gorgeous and has a hipster vibe. It's super original and not like any other coffee house. They play awesome music, have colorful bright lights, local college kids come here to do work. The locals donate board games! This place is built in an abandoned movie theater! Super cool.
The only downfall is the bathrooms aren't too clean and there are no locks on the bathroom doors.
Staff is friendly and will definitely help with recommendations.
MUCH BETTER THAN STARBUCKS. Try the Carmella frappe, a million times better than a Caramel frappe at Starbucks.<//text>

<Text>Yesterday was my first time at Empresso and I absolutely loved it! It has that sort of chill factor that makes you want to stay forever. Plus it's also quite if you ever needed to do homework. And they have an open mic night on Thursday and Friday! I'm sold! It's like Starbucks...but better.<//Text>< Time>

I've been going here since 2004, back when it was called java aroma. It's still the best coffee place I've ever been to. The drinks are amazing, the staff and owners are awesome, and the atmosphere is super cool. I love it, never go anywhere else. Plus, the croissants are killer. I keep trying to find out where they get them. :)<//Text>

Good coffee, super fun atmosphere, super eclectic crowd and staff. Not stuck up and no cookie cutter decorations. A very unique coffee shop, great for study our hanging out, but only if you're not even a little OCD. A-type personalities need not apply.</review>

<text>Very nice staff. Super cool atmosphere, has great music and I liked the diversity of people that were present. I had a beer there, really good. Lots of seating and plenty of outdoor seating. There little tables that looks like students study on. They had a great dessert selection and looked like they had grub. The area is wonderful to walk around and I was able to get Uber fairly easily.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Great coffee in Stockton with a large selection of brews and teas. Plenty of seating inside the old Royal theater, although it is a fairly popular place that can get full. They have various sweets to snack on as well. I usually partake in their cold brew nitro coffee.</text>

After having just one frap from Empresso Coffee House I HAVE NEVER been back to Starbucks.  Great individual personalities that work there. If they're busy you still get your drink or food quickly. I just love everything about Empresso Coffee House....<//text>

<Text>Respect for the business preserving what the city won't. Chill place to hang and do H.W. till midnight. Prices are better than Starbucks. Use to be a theater and it shows.< /Text>< Pics>

Great space to chill. Good wifi. Never rushed and computers for "rent". If you ever bought popcorn at the Stockton Royal it deserves a revisit to see a good use of space. Wished they had better food options.< /text>

Empresso Coffee House is not just a place to go get coffee but a place that serves local brewed beers, and great food. Being located in part of the old Empire Theater it stands out as one of Stockton historic icons. With free Wi-Fi, a great atmosphere, and awesome service. Why wouldn't any want to come here and relax. Empresso easily gets five stars!!</Review>

I'm not much of a coffee drinker but when I want one, they serve a great cup of dark roasted coffee.  A heck of alot better than Starbucks.     😎 Abracadabra</text>

<Gmap_id>0x80900d71bad2f289:0xdd621f51ee651b2b</Gmap_id><Review>Unfortunately, on the 1st day of my New Year, I had a pretty bad experience (once again mind you) at Empresso Coffeehouse. Let me first start off by saying I really think this place is cool. I like the array of events that happen there and the majority of people who frequent the spot seem to be artistic & peaceful. It's the customer service & attitude from certain staff members that is the problem. Not all of them....but certain ones for sure. I tend not to go to Empresso Coffeehouse so often anymore due to several other past incidents that happened there with staff but after a year or 2 hiatus from this place, I've recently tried to let bygones be bygones & started to visit the place once or twice a month again. But today's incident took the cake.....literally & just reenforced the reason why I stopped going there in the first place. I went in this place of business to purchase several pastries for me and my family to enjoy for New Year's. The cashier by the name of Tiffany was helping a white lady in front of me. The service she provided to the lady before me seemed to be pretty good & fair. But I immediately noticed a not so friendly vibe from Tiffany once it was my turn for assistance. Maybe she's having a bad day or a hang over from last night's New Year's festivities but whatever it is, she seemed to be not so friendly specifically towards me. I overlooked her unfriendly demeanor and waited....& waited for her to at least say hello or how can I help you. After about 30-45 uncomfortable seconds of me standing right in front of her while she acted as if she didn't see me there, she finally looked up and says "Do you need something?"  I brushed that off as well and told her yes while pointing to the piece of pastry that I wanted. She looked at the pastry as if she was frustrated, then asked, "Is that all you want?". I told her that I'd like to order several more pastries as well. After she sighed & acted like she was doing me a favor by dragging herself to the back room to get a box to place the pastries in, she came back and started picking pieces other than what I had asked for. I reiterated that I wanted the particular pieces that I asked for. She began to argue with me saying all the pieces were the same. Even though they were not all the same, I asked if all the pieces are the same, why can't I choose the piece that I want? She began to tell me how she can't choose one piece over another & how they have to pick a certain piece and blah blah blah.....it didn't make a bit of sense. I tried to brush it off again and asked her to please give me what I'm paying for and she was absolutely reluctant in providing me with what I asked for. I then asked for her manger and she informed that Empresso Coffeehouse does not have a manager. Found that strange as well. Then I asked who is the owner. She told me his name is Troy but he can not be contacted for blah blah blah reasons....once again....made no sense. I immediately turned and left the building. I have since obtained Troy's full name (Troy Burke), email, Facebook, etc....and messaged him about this incident. I truly hope he or someone who acts as some sort of management for this place responds or contacts me soon in regards to this extremely poor & unacceptable customer service being directed towards a paying customer that would actually like to frequent this place business. I'm not sure why she acted this way & I don't want to make any assumptions that seem to be part of the reason why because I don't want to believe in hate to that degree in a place of business like this but......until I am contacted, I have no choice but to go back to my previous sentiments about Empresso Coffeehouse & take my money elsewhere. Please learn how to treat all customers the same regardless of race, gender, if you're having a bad day, etc...etc.... Your paying customers deserve that. Happy New Year!

UPDATE: 1/6/2016
This is an update to my review since being contacted by the owner. He apologized & was extremely sincere & professional. I was informed all issues were addressed. Thank you!< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

This place has the best croissants!! I recommend the Dirty Chai (chai w/ espresso shot). The chai there is a bit on the sweet side for me but coupled with a shot of espresso it is simply perfection!< /Review>

<text>It's not Peets but it is Stockton and a reminder that as long as you don't give up on a city...good things can happen.

When I lived in Stockton in the 80s,  I often said that if the Royal went down, the place would make a great little coffee concept. My vision was a little more upscale, a little closer to Berkeleyesque but still maintaining a funk that few places could provide without being run by air cooled engine enthusiasts. Bravo Stockton for supporting such a place and bravo to ownership for providing the space.

As for the coffee, not bad. The house coffee is often just on the cusp of hitting the shelf life which is normal for indies......you'll know by the coffee having that initial hit immediately followed by thought of what if I simply add sugar. The finish is bitter...any fragrance beaten into submission. Still, it does accomplish it's task of hitting you over the head into consciousness. And while a pastry might soften the blow, it only makes the coffee that much more difficult, even with a little extra cream. Some would argue that intensity and bitterness go Mano a Mano. ...not so gentle readers. Other suggest using sugar....sorry....coffee should not require sugar to have a balanced experience while the mouth is processing the initial consumption. Perhaps the roaster took a few extra minutes taking that restroom break during the most critical period of the roasting process or perhaps not enough time was given to the mellowing of the beans after roasting. Personally I favor roasting beans on site if for no other reason that the aroma carries for miles and coffee freaks follow the scent to the source and statistically consume an extra cup per visit......important if you charge for refills. Still, simply brewing a new pot on a more established and consistent time table is often the simple solution.

Service meets expectations. Decora could stand less dust though not a complete sterilization as that would impinge on the funk factor. Outdoor seating is a nice touch. ....no bullet proof vests needed. Nice view of other nice establishments worthy of inspection. In fact the Miracle Mile is the gem of Stockton in my view. Parking is good enough during peak periods unless your longest stretch is from your bed to kitchen to toilet every day.

Yes....Stockton is good people.</text>< Pics>

Former movie cinema reinvented as a hipstery coffeehouse with indoor and outdoor seating, espresso drinks made with transfixing latte art, and a full munchies menu that includes sandwiches, pizzas, and alcohol.

Open late, composed of local art, bulletin boards and college lounge decor. Plenty of seating filled with conversations, writers scribbling into Moleskines, coders and laptop bound interweb denizens. Staff is friendly and relaxed. Great place to catch up with friends or wind down the weekend with a book or your Spotify playlists.<//Text>

Excellent organic locally roasted coffee. One of the best cappuccinos around, never burned like some of the other places.

Their baked goods are unique and delicious as well,   If you have a chance to try the blackberry bar do it! You won’t regret it.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1618419965903, 'text': 'Thank you Jena!

Great coffee, beautiful location. Baked goods are quite good with the exception of the scones which are bland. I ordered one of everything and I found the other baked selections wonderful. Including the raspberry pie bars and cheese cake.<//text>

We loved this little coffee shop and it was worth the drive from Fortuna in the morning to get ready for a day of touring around. Nice loose leaf green tea and great tasting coffee. Very friendly baristas and we really enjoyed the environment. Photos and art on the walls, a hand made kayak shop in the back, 1920's jazz playing, and lots of touches that give this place a lot of character and makes it one of the more memorable coffee shops we've visited. The town is beautiful to walk around on a soft morning.<//Text>

<Text>The ONLY coffee shop in town and it’s excellent.  The cat, Luna, is totally chill and falls asleep on your lap in front of the fireplace. Smooth coffee and great selection of tea.  Staff is super cool and groovy.  Pour overs, espresso, excellent coffee.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Went to get pastries and hot chocolates for the family, but left when none of the customers were wearing face masks. You can't expect much better from boomers, but bummed that employees weren't asking folks to follow the "wear a mask" sign on the door. Too bad, my family and I loved this place. 😔 This is why we can't have nice things I guess. #okayboomer<//review><response>{'time': 1609397190836, 'text': 'Hi, Jaxx.

An incredibly curated coffee shop & a perfect meeting place for creatives and community. Mind's Eye Manufactory not only serve delicious coffee, home made treats & great conversation, but they also facilitate woodworking classes and community events as well. This is the perfect destination in one of California's most picturesque towns!<//Review>

Really comfortable space. Would be a great place to work. The coffee and scones with local jelly are also wonderful. They have non-dairy alternatives and sometimes special syrups (eg lavender) to add to your coffee or tea.</Review>

Unique, fun setting with a piano and violin available for any musician to play.  I also had the best latte of my entire trip to the North coast, which included their homeade syrups, and the owner was really friendly, and willing to answer questions.   If you're looking for a locally owned coffee shop with excellent coffee this is your place!< /Text>

If this is the place I think it is, they had the yummiest muffins and the most unique restroom with goldfish in a porthole in the wall and other unique amenities!<//Review>

This was such a cute place. My husband and I really liked mind's eye. We each ordered a cafe mocha with extra whipped cream and we shared a cream scone with blackberry jam. We sat by the fireplace and read the newspaper.   Check out the restroom if you get a chance to. It was one of those that has the water tank with the pull chain up high. It's actually quite an interesting restroom. A lot going on and worth checking out it feels kind of haunted. Mine's eye is walking distance to everything downtown old Town. We will definitely visit the next time we are in Ferndale.<//Review>

Great place run by great people. The vibe they got going is one I have yet to find in any other shop, even my own. This is the shop where I first had that "AHA" moment with coffee. Great drinks, great baked goods.</Review>

I'm not sure if it is an actual menu item but I ordered something called Princess Jasmine...........THANK YOU!  I think I ordered it hot but it may also come iced? I love jasmine teas with alternative milk like almond or coconut that have a good jasmine flavor and a light level of sweetness. They are not easy to find. I thought this was FANTASTIC in flavor. Great stuff guys! Please keep it around! :)< /text>

<text>Really excellent coffee at a reasonable price.  This place is comfortable,  with a friendly feel.  The regulars are greeted by name entering and leaving.  While the brewed drinks are slow getting out,  they have an urn of pre- made coffee with instructions to leave your money in the tin. Essentially an Express lane. I prefer the brewed selections which are really superior to almost anywhere I've tried.< /text>< Resp>

When you go to Ferndale check out this historic building where you can sit and enjoy good coffee, homemade scones and cookies. It is a relaxing atmosphere in an old building where the back end of the building is a boat building and carpenter workshop.<//Text>

Stopped here while in town for a wedding. The coffee was fantastic and the staff friendly. Definitely a cool shop! Loved seeing the handmade boads from the workshop at the back of the store! The vintage cash register was a cool touch too. Be aware they have one size option for drinks so no venti large small grande craziness.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Superb little town very peaceful from another time.
We had a little coffee in mind's eye which was very good, handcrafted, the pastries are also very good, a great stop before hitting the road.

(Original)
Superbe petite ville très paisible d'un autre temps.
Nous avons pris un petit café au mind's eye qui été très bon, fabrication artisanale, est les pâtisserie sont très bonne également, un super stop avant de reprendre la route.<//Review>

One of the best auto shops I've come across in San Diego. I did a lot of research and asking around before my neighbor recommended this place.

I worked with both Jay and Brian regarding my 2007 Corolla. Because my car is older (and needed a thorough maintenance check) I was wary about which auto shop I went to because I didn't want to get unnecessary work done. Both guys were incredibly knowledgeable, honest, and realistic on what was worth getting fixed on my car, which I appreciated. I also think their prices are super reasonable.</review>

John's Automotive Care in La Mesa is truly a great resource for automobile owners who want the best for their car. We really needed help getting our 1978 Triumph Spitfire back on the road and the great mechanic, Robert, with years of specialized experience exceeded our expectations with solid repairs (battery, brakes, tune-up, radiator) and special parts, including finding a salvage rear axle in northern California that was necessary to get us back on the road! We passed smog tests when John fixed our car back in 2017, and today 2019 we just passed smog again! Thanks to Robert and to John's Automotive for solid work with a smile!< /review>

<Text>I took my car in at 8am on a Friday morning for engine code P0456 (Evap emissions). Brian and Jay were extremely professional and considerate of my time and offered to first change the gas cap and clear the code, which saved me from spending my day off at the mechanic and spending more $ than I may have needed to! Top notch customer service!</Text>< user_id>

My brakes went out on my work truck over the weekend and needed them fixed Monday as I need it for work. I looked up all the local shops near by that had the best ratings and reviews. Johns had the best reviews and Brian (manager) said he could get it done same day. He ball parked the price to be around $400.00 - $450.00. I was transparent with Brian about my situation and needed it done ASAP and that I’m strapped on money. He called me around 11:30 am and said it was going to cost $800.00+ for brakes and rotors which is insane.. I had to do it though because I wouldn’t have time to get it to a different shop and he knew that… Brian called me a couple hours later and said it would be ready 5:45 pm. I get to the shop with my roommate and grandma to pick the truck up and it wasn’t done. They said he (the mechanic mike) was just finishing up and need to drive it around the block to make sure it was driving fine. It’s suppose to be a mile around the block but he was gone for 15 min. He walks in and tells me that the brakes are over heating and the caliper is sticking and it’s not safe to drive. I called my boss who was a mechanic for 10 plus years and he said to ask if they put a temperature gage to it and they said they did and it was 20 degree difference.. my boss said to pay for it and drive home and he would look at it the next day. So, I told them this and the guy “helping” me got real wide eyed like he was worried and called brain (manager) and tried to tell me that I couldn’t have my truck because it wasn’t safe, then it turned into, “we want to make it right.” I told them I want my truck and want to leave. They didn’t let me pay for it and gave me my truck back. The truck is driving fine and the next day Brian called me apologizing and said, “it was a mistake.” How does a mechanic and a shop with a five star rating not know that the brakes would adjust them self? I told Brian if I was paying any money for their, “service” I would be leaving a review about my experience. Brian said he was going to push it up the later and about an hour later Bryan (higher up manager)calls me and says they could drop the price to what he originally quoted me $450.00 and that his mechanic should’ve known better and that they made a mistake. They acted like it was life and death if I drove it home. Come to find out my truck was fine and the temperature difference on the brake pads was normal, Of course the brakes were going to be hot when he drove it around for 15 min instead of a mile. This is the exact reason why people don’t trust mechanics. Sure didn’t seem like a mistake to me… be careful of this shop people<//Text>

This is the go-to place.   Professional, courteous, knowledgeable.  I’ve brought numerous vehicles them.  Cannot be happier with their service(s).   I feel additional repairs are never “forced” on me.  They give you a complete breakdown of what needs immediate attention down, to what can wait then to, later down the line this will need to get looked at.  Nothing compared to dealers where you go in for an oil change and next thing you know your walking out spending a couple hundred bucks.   I’m very meticulous about my cars (ranging from 2001-2018) and where I bring them.  I know I can call John or Brian, tell them what’s going on, drop it off and (like I always tell them, I’m in no rush just call me when it’s done) never have to worry about anything else.   Hard to find a reliable and trustworthy auto repair spot but this place is it.   I’ve already sent my roommates to John’s and they’ve also continued to bring their vehicles there and they’ve continued to be happy with their services.   Highly, highly recommend John’s Automotive Care.   Plus they have cold sodas and water 👍🏿 😄<//text>

This is our second time using John’s.  They are friendly, honest, and straightforward.  They did not attempt to pad the bill with unnecessary work, and the price was truly reasonable.</Review>

They replaced my alternator and made sure my car was safe to drive and taken care of. They really went the extra mile and repaired my car even when they were short-staffed.< /Review>

Brian was great to work with, he explained the process, sent me the estimate and we discuss it to my satisfaction. He said it would take 3-5 days depending if they found something that couldn't be seen. He called me the next day, expecting bad news, he actually let me know one of the items could actually be resolved under a KIA manufacturer recall saving me money. My car was ready on the 4th day, Jay his co-worker on the counter offered to put me in touch with someone at KIA of El Cajon, it will be there this Wednesday less than a week after picking it up. I didn't meet the mechanic\s that worked on my car but they must be not only good but honest. Thanks to all at John's!!!<//Text>

This is the second time I have taken my car in for service to JAC.  I wouldn’t take my car anywhere else.  Comparable prices, quality service, not to mention an amazing team , very respectful and honest.  If you don’t give them a try it’s definitely your loss. Oh I’m 61 and owned a lot of vehicles in my life and dealt with a lot of dealerships and automotive care centers ...  I think I’m a good judge.  They are AWESOME!<//review>

These guys have been so good to us. My wife and I  moved to California a little over a year ago and left behind a mechanic I had been with for 15 years. I was worried it would be difficult to find a mechanic I could trust to be honest with me, but then we found John's Automotive and Brian. Brian has been absolutely spectacular to work with. We've visited them twice with our car and both times Brian's personality, honesty and genuineness have shone through. We feel so comfortable coming in. Thanks for keeping us moving guys!< /review>

Great staff, well trained and honest. When I said I was moving out of state and that I wished there was another John's where im going, they promised to help my find a good mechanic (as they know people where I moved to) after I arrived. I use them all the time and will continue to do so if ever I'm back in San Diego.</text>

<review>Recently moved to the area from a different part of san diego and was looking for a new mechanic.  This shop had good reviews on Yelp so I chose them.  The shop was clean, customer service was friendly and professional.  The wheel alignment that they did fixed the thumping noise on a new car I bought that was starting to take the fun of driving it away.  So far, so good!< /review>< rate>

There was a problem with the vehicle about three weeks after it had been in the shop. I talked to Ray and he was very quick to offer to send out a tow. Three days later they were still unable to replicate the problem.

They did go above and beyond to ensure that the problem did not return. I expected to pay for the time, the parts and the tow. Because the problem if it returned could cause a major accident they refused any payment and stated that it was a public service they do for their customers.

I bought and maintain this vehicle for an elderly woman to help her be independent and get to her medical appointments, and store etc. I appreciated John's Auto helping me out with such good service.< /review>

Very honest/upfront. There are also some doves living in the potted plants out front. 10/10 in service and cuteness(for the doves).</text>

Got my car serviced for an A/C inspection. I don’t know much about cars so I tend to be nervous. I wasn’t sure what to expect and I was going off of the reviews here, and...everything good about this place is true. My car turned out to have a small problem and it was returned to me within hours. I most appreciate their professionalism, and customer service.< /text>

Probably the best mechanic I’ve been to. They took their time to figure out the problems with my vehicle even after two days of it passing tests and then gave me realistic advice about how to proceed once the problems were found. They break down the entire inspection and let you know item-by-item what the problem is and how it is caused/fixed. Brian was great about calling in and giving updates, and was a really nice guy to deal with in general. Definitely recommend their service!<//Review>

Had the chance to get my oil change done by these guys. I was surprised how cheap a full synthetic oil change was. 25 dollar discount for first time customers and the people are good people too. Very hard to find a honest mechanic shop.< /review>

This was my first time going here, but my husband has been here for oil changes. They were really professional and I very much appreciated the extra steps they took to communicate my cars needs with actual proof. They send you progress photos to your email and photos of items that need to be fixed and such. Made the whole process feel very open and honest and I appreciate that. I will be back!</Text>

Brian was very helpful and extremely polite. I got a great deal and they were 100% honest with me. I went in to you have my brakes serviced on my 2014 BMW 328i and they knew the ins and outs of my vehicle. I didn't tell them that I'm an automotive tech and that I had previously inspected my vehicle to see if they would try and sell me on a bunch of stuff that I did not need. I'm very happy to say that they passed the test with flying colors. They gave me a very fair price and even gave me a first-time discount as well as paid for my Uber home while waiting for my vehicle to be finished. I highly recommend John's automotive!</Text>

Yesterday was my first visit.  My brother has been a customer here for many years!  There are multiple vehicles in his family and they all are serviced here.  He is a happy customer!  I had a great experience and I met Brian, Bryan and John.  They are business-friendly, focused and very helpful.  They will explain everything to you and answer your questions.  I was shown patience and respect.  John is such a great guy.  He took me home and back- this is superior customer service!  I felt comfortable with everything and they are very well organized.  I fully trust this business!  Thank You guys!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>What can I say about this place. I'll start with I came in for service but I got a lot more. The people that work here genuinely care about the people and the job. They share great stories and are very engaging with their customers. While there I learned a lot about the business. They actively participate in the Boys and Girls club cash for cars, and it seems that they donate tons of time and cash to the program. They had many customers come in that as soon as they came in, knew thier name. Everyone laughs and jokes but they get the job done. I had an oil change, headlight, and TPMS system fixed. The cost was very reasonable and the quality of work was outstanding. My wife and I have decided to make this our auto shop of preference and will give them our business. Great shop, great people, and great work. Price was great!< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1602370272527, 'text': 'There is nothing better than finding a review like this one, Bryce.

John’s automotive did an excellent job on my truck. Customer service was amazing, their inspection and appraisal were accurate and affordable. I have used many different automotive shops in San Diego in the past. After this experience I will take all my vehicles to John’s and recommend them to all my friends.< /review>

Had to drop the car off after a flashing engine light. They ran the diagnostics first thing next day, then helped us get the car to the dealership where we actually had the car under warranty. This shop could have easily charged us several thousands for work, but opted to act above and beyond the expectation. I would definately return to this automotive repair shop in the future.</Text>

I was looking at buying a 4WD Lexus so I brought it here for a pre-purchase inspection.  I wanted to know if there were any mechanical issues before I bought it.  They put it up on the lift, had the wheels off, and completed a thorough inspection and identified issues and provided pictures of the trouble spots.  They only charged $89 and provided detailed assessments of the work that needed to be done.  Very happy with service.</review>

Seriously the best shop I've ever been to. I've had troubles with my truck for years, been to many shops, had a lot of work done and none of those shops compare to John's Automotive. They went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me out and make sure my truck was running great. Brian and John are genuinely great guys who want to help. They are very knowledgeable and even send an extensive email detailing your entire vehicle's maintenance, including pictures! I am blown away by this place. I left feeling so good about my choice to go there. They now have me as a customer for life. Thank you guys so much.<//Review>

I brought in my 2000 Jaguar to them after being referred by another shop that didn’t work on Jaguars.  I was so happy with the service, friendly, efficient and not trying to over charge the customer.   If you’ve a foreign car, please try them, wonderful shop!< /Review>

Brian was most helpful. He was genuinely concerned about helping me. He went above and beyond to make sure that I am  taken cared of. I could tell he wanted what was best for me and my car problem and not how much the company could profit from my problem. He’s a great example of customer service!< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< gmap_id>

I have had my Jeep at several shops in the last couple of years and spent lots of money. Still after all that it still had the Death Wabble. The Mechanics at John's greeted me and treated me like family and let me know I was in good hands. My Jeep is running and driving awesome. No Death Wabble. 5 Stars to John's Automotive.

<Text>I called for a quote regarding my a/c for a Honda CRV on Friday.  I was scheduled for an appointment to drop it off on Monday morning.  Probably the least painless process through and through from any mechanics shop I’ve experienced since living in San Diego.  Brian was awesome, funny, friendly, and reassuring.

<Text>Always a pleasure to work with the people at John's Auto Repair. They made me an appointment that was quick and perfect for my busy schedule. The work was done at a price as promised and exactly on time. They included a detailed inspection of the vehicle in addition to the work performed, and spoke knowledgeably about potential future problems and recommended preventative maintenance. All without a sales pitch. Their prices are very competitive, especially compared to the Big Name Places. The best part is that they treated me not only as a valued customer - I felt like a family member. It is very easy for me to trust the safety of my family to John's Auto Repair. Definitely 2 'Thumbs up!' and 5 stars, for sure.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1554164026029, 'text': 'Music to our ears!

Just recently they fixed a problem with my smog test that the dealer could not figure. The cost of that diagnosis and repair was about the same dealer charged for an unsuccessful diagnosis.  I give them my strongest recommendation. They are all very friendly  (personable) and professional.  I am so glad they there when we need them.

My experience with John's Automotive is always excellent customer satisfaction!!  Dave Carr always treat my car as if it were his own.  I will not trust the repairs to my vehicle with any other repair shop period.  Fore sure, I give John's Automotive - the highest rating of Five(5).  Women especially, can trust this shop, and not feel they will be taken advantage of.</Review>

I have had horrible experiences at other shops to where I have had to wait over a month to get my car back. So I dreaded to take my husbands car in. Johns automotive care completely put my mind to ease. Towed my husbands car Friday and they were done by Tuesday. Calling every chance they had to update me on my husbands car. They were also patient about payment and knew I couldn’t pay till following week. Thank you ☺️<//review>

These guys were great! My starter went out on my car & they got me in & out on the same day. They saved me money on the parts as well. I’ll definitely be going back to these guys when & if I need work done again. Dave was also very helpful, knowledgeable & funny. Give these guys a shot if you’re looking for quality/ hassle free work done.< /Review>

This is the best automative care that I have ever received. The staff is always nice and very helpful. Dave is always very informative when he tells you what maintenance needs to be done on the vehicle. They will not overcharge, or try to do something on the vehicle that is does not need. With that being said they will still tell you all that can be done to make the vehicle work to its fullest capacity. They also have a courtesy drop off, which helps A LOT. They put you as a customer first.<//text>

My Son in law insisted I go Ram Dealer to check my engine light. From past experience I didn't want to.  There had to be a place that could diagnose my truck.  I looked at quite a few,  checked there reviews and Fortunately found John's Automotive.  Made the appt on line.  Called later that same morning to confirm. Mentioned to me at that time they could provide a ride for me.  Couldn't have worked out better. Truck was fixed without having all these other Recommendations that were needed from Other place.  Also picked me up to get my truck within a few minutes. In today's fast paced world that goes a long way.  Thank you Dave.</Review>

Brian took care of us and the entire staff was great to work with. They frequently update you with detailed pictures and that have a shuttle driver named John who is very nice. My family couldn't be happier with their flawless service and not only will we go back again, but we highly recommend this place to everyone. Way to go and great job!!!< /text>< Pictures>

Dave assisted me at John's. He made sure ei understood everything that was wrong with my car and had it repaired in a little longer than a day. Great service. Very helpful staff. Prices are surely cheaper than the dealership but better maintenance.< /Review>

This is the second time I’ve used
this great company. They diagnose your
vehicle correctly the first time in a expediant manor and keep you informed
about the progress.
If you want it done right the first time
go to John’s Automotive Care.< /Review>

<Text>I own a Mercedes Benz convertible and I'm picky as to who works on my car. To find a good Mercedes mechanic is hard. I live in Spring Valley and my last mechanic was in Oceanside and when he retired I was at a loss. I was told by another mechanic to go to Harloff's in La Mesa. The day I went there was rth first day of it being John's automotive. I was pleased to find out they still had the same mechanic who knows the ins and outs of a Mercedes. Every time I take my car there I know I'm getting the best service and know the job is done right. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They even have a shuttle service. Wow! I can't say enough good things about them. If you take your car there no matter what make, you will not be disappointed!</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1568397254124, 'text': 'Thanks for the wonderful review, Timothy.

Once again, the team at John’s Automotive has exceeded all expectations in servicing my vehicle. I am treated as if I was part of the family every time. I thought I was due for new tires, but they let me know, I still had more wear on them. So now I’ll get more out of my tires. Can’t say enough good about them. Visit them!

<text>Brian and Dave were the two gentlemen who helped me . I must admit I was a little hesitant because the business changed ownership but my husband and I were very impressed by the pictures sent of all the parts that needed replacement even pictures of the tire tread  !!! Once I gave them the go ahead they quickly did the repairs and we definitely got our monies worth in labor , customer service .

<Review>I've been going to the John's automotive on Riverdale St since getting a different car over 2 years ago. However this one opened up closer to home somewhere near 6 or so months ago and it is showing the same quality of service from the other John's. Very professional, have a courtesy driver, and no complications after repairs. Now very important to me; unlike Midas, I don't see any evidence of sabotage to try to get more money out of you. I didn't know this till today but they have an after hours drop off box if you cannot bring it in the morning. Might be a little hard to do it right now with the construction going on since there is nowhere to park the car on the street, but still. Good to know for the future.

Also if you are coming in with construction during office hours and were confused like me since the main entrance was blocked off, they have a second entrance on Lowell St.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Brought in due to a noise from rear due to backing up over a concrete parking lot dividing.  Was told I needed front struts for $1500.  I paid them for  the diagnostic charge and took my car to a dealership.  Verdict: It was a loose bolt on the rear shock.  It was tightened free of charge .  There is no evidence that I needed new struts.  Either John’s Automotive care is extremely incompetent or extremely dishonest to single females.</Text>< response>

A bit disappointed with the outcome of my full set especially since it's been so long since I had them. I presented them with a picture and they acted as if it wouldn't be a problem to do the design which was marble and ombre. He made them shorter than I wanted and couldn't get the shape right either. The marble design looks more like clouds. I paid $68 and wish I would have just waited to go to a nail specialist that could have executed better. I was also directed to use used brushes to scrub my cuticles when washing my hands which I simply refused to do. I'm not sure that they sanitize their tools either. I will not be returning. Here's a pic of what I got on top vs what I wanted.<//Review>

Best techs and they speak English!! No waiting  and professional. Hand washing instructions as you enter shop.They used good products.
Foot and hand massage the best.
Highly recommend especially mink lashes that are not heavy or to loose your own lash that I have experienced in the past.< /text>

They made you feel right at home and matched the color that you wanted. Nails are perfect. First time for acrylic nails for me. Enjoyed my experience there.<//Review>

I definitely recommend! Owners are super friendly and easy to get along with. I love how Summer fixed my nails after my previous nail stop screwed them up.</Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>Needed to find a place that did matte style nails and wonderfully found this place by my house. It can be a long wait if you don't make and appointment but its worth the wait. I love the massage chairs which always work and are clean. I get gel matte acrylic nails for $30 and gel matte pedigree for $30. I've had my nails done by two different people and both did a fantastic job...remember to properly tip your technician.< /review>< rate>

<Review>Great customer service and great nail design. My nails are beautiful. I generally go to Laque Nail Bar and they are almost double the price for the same quality!  And the staff here are much more friendly.
Cleanliness was my only issue.</Review>< date>

<review>This place is great.
Mike is the best.
He does all my nails exactly how I want them.
The acrylics are thin and it looks like your nail. Prices are super fair!</review>< pictures>

These ladies are the best! This is my go to nail salon for a year now. Everyone is so nice and they all do excellent work. It's a small place, and it does get crowded sometimes, but they do their best to keep things moving along.< /Text>

So I will not visit this location anymore 😒 I live in the area, I shop at the other local business in the strip mall, recently my eye brow tech retired after 20 years, so iv been looking for a new person, so 2 months ago I decided to try this location she did a decent job, as I observed she can only do one shape, but they looked better then it was. I decided to go again, granted I was a walk in, and they where crowded, I sat down, no one acknowledged my arrival, i asked where the eye brow tec she was doing a pedi, I waited 20 min when she got done she sat another client down and prepped her for a mani, I thought she would at least update me on her schedule but nope, then I new client walked in for a color change and she preceded to work on her....I got up and walked out....not the best customer service so now I need to find another salon<//Text>

(Translated by Google) In Japan, the nail that costs about $ 50 is $ 15. . . I did it right away even though I had no reservation! I want to use it again!

Good pre-exam advice and preparation. Friendly, confident exam team. Prepare for a fairly long wait before a procedure, but once commenced, it is quick and painless. Very professional.<//Text>

< review>
the professionalism of every person on Dr. Shelby's staff from the appointment scheduler to the receptionist to each member of the medical team was outstanding. I came for an 11:30 procedure and was on my way home a little after 1 pm. Among other things that shows me they valued my time as much as their own.
I would rate this experience as 5* in all respects.</review>

Services provided were of high quality and efficient.  All procedures were provided timely.  Preparation activities were effective.  The office staff was sensitive, friendly, knowledgeable, and generous with information,  Followup activity was also provided very timely.  I am very satisfied with my experience with this firm.  I highly recommend this firm.</Text>

Dr. Shelby and his staff are very friendly and extremely professional.  I have been seeing him for more than 10 years. He explains everything in a clear and understandable manner.  I would highly recommend him.<//Text>

The facility was five star but my interaction with Dr. Shelby not so much. I only met him in the in the surgery room as he popped his head over to introduce himself seconds before I was sedated. Then I never saw him again. No update on how it went with the procedure after I woke up. The nurse had me get dressed and go to the waiting room to meet my ride. No wheelchair or escort out despite feeling wobbly after the sedation. Great facility, quick in and out, but the human component was a disappointment.</Text>

A++ in all aspects!  I had a colonoscopy and every person on his team from pre-op to post-op couldn’t have been nicer.  They were all very knowledgeable and informative as was Dr Shelby himself.  Excellent bedside manner and explained everything that went on during the procedure and answered all of my questions.</review>

Dr. Shelby is Wonderful and caring doctor who is well trained and up on all the latest info/tech in the GI speciality, terrific professional staff, and beautiful facility!  I have had 4 endoscopy procedures in my lifetime and by far this is the best compared to other physicians practices.<//review>

<text>Terrible GI doctor!!
No follow ups at all and he doesn't want to see you at all --only does video calls which he calls late.
My son had C DIFF and he did not even call us to prescribe any antibiotic!!
My son suffered and had a delayed in treatment and had to see another doctor.
I am a nurse do I know the medical field
I should have NEVER bought my son to see Dr Shelby!!!
Dr Shelby only wants your money and does not care about you as his patient!!!
Be warned!! Do not see Dr Shelby!!😠😰😱</text><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808ff28d821a2f19:0x4ff165c312f037e2<//GmapID>< Pics>

<date>1619222100686</date><rate>5</rate><Text>I had a colonoscopy this morning.  Dr. Shelby and his staff were fabulous.  The facilities were clean and orderly.

I was in and out in an hour and 15 minutes.

AND the anesthetic wore off very quickly so they have figured out how to use the correct dosage so I didn't have to waste any of my remaining day.

The pre-warmed blanket was a welcome and thoughtful touch.

Yes - I could not be happier with the service I received.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I was booked with Dr. Shelby for 2 procedures and both his office staff and Dr. Shelby were  punctual and professional when speaking with me.  They passed on information in a timely manner and I was always treated with care and concern, before and during the procedures. I will definitely use his services in the future.  Thank you.</Text>< Resp>

Excellent staff.  Intern promised I could play golf two days after procedure.  I couldn’t play before procedure so he might have been mistaken.  Timely service, comfortable atmosphere.  Third time with Dr. Shelby and I hope he’s always available.<//review>

No one looks forward to having a colonoscopy, but Dr. Shelby and his staff make the experience as easy as possible. When I was discussing the "prep" which is the most difficutl part with his staff, I mentioned that I did not like jello. The staff member advised me that many people found jello to be helpful during the prep, so I bought some and made it up. She was right. having something solid made the all liquid diet much easier.
Dr. Shelby's group is very efficient from the time I arrived for my colonoscopy until the time I left was only 45 minutes. The cleanout wasn't pleasant, but other than that it was not bad.<//Review>

Awesome communication. They did a virtual prep meeting to talk about details of the procedure. They were in contact with calls, texts and email.  Day of procedure was fast and very efficient. Dr. Shelby addressed my questions before and after with amazing bedside manners.  I would recommend him and his office staff!< /review>

I went in for my colonoscopy at 6:00 AM this morning and was treated with respect and kindness by everyone I came in contact with from the moment I entered the office.  I was so impressed with how well everyone in the surgery center worked together seamlessly.
I was made to feel very comfortable at all times and my experience was terrific.  Dr. Steve, the anesthesiologist, was exceptional!</Text>

<text>This office was unprofessional, and not clean.
I do not think his name was Shelby either.
His name is Ali Shahabi and cheats people. Beware. He overcharges you and will max out your insurance. Be careful to not be cheated.
There are much better doctors in Dan Ramon who care about medicine and not money.<//text>< pictures>

I have received treatment from Dr. Shelby last year 2019. The service itself was good. But I have objection regarding billing. I was not correctly told about the cost of the procedure properly. I clearly asked them about the whole cost of the procedure. They misinformed me about the bill which was ~$200. But I have already paid more than $600/$700. Also Since 2019, I have been receiving lots of medical bills from Labs associated with the procedure which I had no idea.

I really wish, I did not visited this facility and took a simple treatment whose bill is haunting me henceforth.< /text>

Dr. Shelby has consistently been very thorough and detailed in discussing my medical conditions.  He clearly conveys his medical findings in terms I can understand.  His follow up correspondence has been timely, and I have the utmost respect and confidence in his medical judgement.  I wish all my medical providers were so knowledgeable in their respective fields, and caring with respect to my health and physical well-being!

<Text>Terrible doctor. Scheduled an appt 1 week ago for today and didn’t receive a call from the doctor. When followed up with receptionist was told the doctor didn’t want to see me. Asked why? Said no reason and didn’t want to see me. I wouldn’t do this to my worst enemy. Especially when someone needs to be seen by a doctor for a condition.</Text>< GmapID>

The visit was organized and efficient. Possibly somewhat too efficient. There was a 20-30 minutes wait, followed by efficient set-up for the procedure. Very quick hello with anesthesiologist and out for the procedure. I was told it took about 15 minutes. Afterwards, told to see near exit door and Dr. Shelby made a very fast appearance and to quickly usher us out. As patient, felt pressured to leave quickly. As few more minutes to explain the results, possibly in a small office would have been better.< /Review>

Love Dr. Shelby and all his staff at the Surgery Center.   You are treated with dignity and kindness.  Quick and efficient service.  Would highly recommend.  Dr. Shelby has the kindest bed-side manner ever.  He genuinely cares about you and your health.  I have been using him for over 15 years!!  Wonderful man!!</Review>

Dr Shelby is the nicest and most professional doctor. That is though only the icing on the cake - as he is an extremely competent GI. The facility is top notch and as efficient as can be. Dont even think about anything else.</Text>

Dr. Shelby’s GI surgical suite is very comfortable, great staff and great location. I’ve had several procedures there and felt well taken care of and was finished in a very timely fashion. Dr. Shelby is a kind, understanding and very competent doctor. If you need to do procedures that he does this is the place to come!< /Review>

“I cannot begin to express my satisfaction with the staff at the Executive Surgery Center where I had an endoscopy procedure last June 8, 2017.  From the front desk, to the nurses, and the doctor; each and every one of them was courteous, professional, and made my visit as comfortable as they possibly could.
Dr Shelby is a very busy doctor
but still took the time to make me feel like I was the only patient there.
Adam, the gentleman who took my initial information was terrific, he too made me feel like I was the first patient of the day.
Glenda, a lovely lady who set me up in my cubicle was very professional, very comforting, patiently answered all my questions and made me feel really cared for.
Top- notch facility, very clean, and has a welcoming and positive atmosphere for patients.
What a wonderful group of caring and kindhearted professionals! I feel very blessed to have been served by all of you. May God bless you all with His kindness in return.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</review>

<Review>I just did a procedure done at Dr. Shelby's facility.
Definitely reminded me of the procedures done in 3rd world countries.
Like machine. With no human connection and Least explanations.
My feet was very uncomfortable and out of the bed. ( the surgery bed was too short that my feet was out and uncomfortable) no one asked me anything or checked on me to see if I am comfortable or not.
The explanation before procedure (the day before and preparation) was so insufficient that I started having so much problem after taking one bottle of liquid that they prescribed to make my stomach empty and not being able to finish it I was not aware if I actually am going to have the procedure done or not after all. No contact point to ask questions or if there was a problem.
I have done procedures before that they put me on sleep and I wake up all fresh and rested. Nothing close to that. I was  awake after procedure. (I was looking to have a bit of restful day, after all the diarrhea situation the day before, but it was not the case. And the last thing that was upsetting to me, my underwear was half way down and they didn't bother to put it back how it was before the procedure started. I felt uncomfortable waking up to half way down underwear. Unpleasant experience of the procedure. I do not know much about the doctor Shelby.
I did not like machine like, low service and low quality facility with not much caring staff.< /Review>< Pics>

I have seen Dr. Shelby numerous times and he is always very kind and good at his job. I don’t always feel that the communication is great with his office staff and that many times things are not explained well. But that is my only complaint.  I would continue to recommend this doctor as  he genuinely cares about his patients and their well-being, and goes above and beyond to achieve good customer service.</Text>

<Text>Staff day of procedure were great!  Unfortunately, dealing  with Dr Shelby and his schedule/insurance people prior to procedure was less than pleasant.  They were dismissive, didn't listen, and in the case of the woman scheduling, just plain rude.  When it came time to discuss my payment for the two procedures, they were very annoyed by my request to understand the cost breakdown between procedures.  Ironically, the "follow up" email(s) I've received was not to provide info on my procedure results, but to give a Google review. Fortunately, it doesn't appear there are any complications requiring me to return to Dr Shelby's practice - next time I need GI care, I will definitely go elsewhere.<//Text>< Name>

The colonoscopy procedure was quick and easy.  The nurses were very friendly and helpful, and answered all of my questions.  Everyone made me feel comfortable.  Dr. Shelby explained the results of the procedure very soon after.  This is the second time Dr. Shelby performed this procedure for me and I won't hesitate to use him again for my next one.</text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Shelby's for almost ten years. My experience with him and his staff have always been excellent. The scheduling staff has always been helpful in finding an open date for an appointment. The Surgery Center staff are always highly professional and courteous.

Dr. Shelby is not only and excellent surgeon but he has a wonderful 'beside" presence that has made me both comfortable and confident that I am getting the best possible advice and treatment.<//review>

Now on to Dr. Shelby he is excellent he took the time to thoroughly explain everything that was going on with me, in a way that i understood (this just doesn't happen with all doctors) I left Dr. Shelby's office feeling like i had someone in my corner that genuinely cared about me and was going to lookout for me.

Dr. Shelby is wonderful. His office was able to get me in for an appointment the day after I called, and then Dr. Shelby understood my circumstances and squeezed me in during his lunch, two days later, to do my procedure. I highly recommend Dr. Shelby. He's very knowledgeable and gets right to the point.  So happy I found him.<//Text>

Dr Shelby and his staff were awesome! Very caring,  professional and efficient. Their facility at Crow Canyon Medical Center was very nice. Much easier than having the procedure at the hospital. As s nurse I highly recommend their top notch care!< /review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Everyone and everything about my experience was the best I have experienced in this type of procedure. The only reason I gave a four star review, instead of five, was because of the lady who "helped" me when I first was shown to my room and when I saw her again to leave. I was not given, let alone explained, the discharge instructions. My pick-up driver, as well as I, was shocked when she pointed towards the exit door without offering any directions or alternatives when my driver said she was parked on the other side of the building. I sort of staggered out to the car without help. Everyone else in the process showed much concern and care.<//Review>< pictures>

My first impression of Dr. Shelby and his staff was great. His staff was courteous, and answered all my questions. My appointment for my procedure went flawless, and without incident. I recommend Dr. Shelby for any of your gastronomical medical concerns.</Text>

From first consultation to checking out after my procedure the experience was comfortable! I was treated with dignity and kindness from every person I encountered. If you are putting this off due to any fears, this organization will set you at ease! The peace of mind you have afterwards is well worth the small amount of discomfort while fasting! Call Dr Shelby's office now - you will be happy you did!!< /review>

Dr. Shelby is a consummate professional.  I was very impressed with his advice to decline a non-essential procedure and with the very professional staff he employs.  The procedure I did have went off on time with no difficulty of any kind.  My wife also is a patient of Dr. Shelby and she thinks very highly of him also.< /Review>

<review>Great professional, modern, comfortable and clean facility. Friendly, professional and attentive staff. Minimal to NO waiting. Dr. Shelby personally came in to see me after the exam and discussed his initial findings and explained the follow-up steps. Dr. Shelby is himself,  outgoing, and friendly, and coveys a very personal and professional interest in your issues and we'll being. I personally wouldn't consider any other gastroenterologist than Dr. Shelby.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Dr Shelby is by far the most competent and compassionate gastroenterologist I know. Meeting with him for an intake was excellent - he provided relevant and helpful guidance and support for my condition. The procedure I had performed went without a hitch, and I was in and out of the clinic in just about an hour, with no adverse effects (even no sedation from the anesthesia!). Post the procedure, he gave me my preliminary results and then scheduled a follow-up within the following fe weeks. Overall I feel great about the entire experience and his knowledge about my condition. I would highly recommend Dr. Shelby and his clinic for any of your GI problems!</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>Love Dr.Shelby he is always so kind and caring! The facility was nice and clean, the front desk lady was very pleasant, the nurse was very nice and very good with the IV one shot and he had it in no pain at all!  I  got there 20 minutes early so at 10:10 AM was taken in by 10:20 AM and was  dressed and out of there by 11:20 AM. That was with an endoscopy and a colonoscopy. I would definitely recommend this doctor and this facility!</Text><Time>1496695332467<//Time>< user_id>

The prep for this colonoscopy was extremely unpleasant again this time.  The colonoscopy however, with Dr.Shelby, was surprisingly easy.

<review>I had a colonoscopy done by Salim Shelby MD.  The whole process was extremely easy, painless and fast.  My appointment was at 6:30am and I was out of the building by 7:30am (includes checkin/checkout, before and after talk to a Dr and everything else in between). All personal works together extremely well and everybody is very professional.   I highly recommend Dr. Shelby and his office.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Dr. Shelby is delightful and caring about your healthcare.  Colonoscopy is still a horrible prep work but a very important screening to have.  His facility is a well oiled machine.  It is over before you know it.  This is my third colonoscopy with Dr. Shelby over the last decade.  I highly recommend Dr. Shelby and this facility.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< username>

The office staff is very efficent and made sure that I understood the prep.  The surgical center was well staffed and comfortable: Every medical professional introduced themselves , told me what they were going to do and asked if I had questions.  The procedure itself was like a very pleasant 20-minute nap. Soon after I awoke the doctor came in to tell me what he'd found.   All so much easier than I expected. 5 stars.</Review>< date>

Best I can say is that it is the second time I have utilized his services ... and of course no one goes out of their way to get a colonoscopy.   He is very personable and goes out of his way to give you a clear understanding of the procedure before and after, checking in with you.   Save that prep beforehand, was a good experience.<//review>

Then i asked them to please verify if this office or the further proceduers are covered they didnt respond properly and told me you should be covered its all good.
Later i called them again and asked them how much Endoscopy would be charged and they told me $500. After checking this couple of times, i went to get my endoscopy done but now im charged with $4000 bill and have been told i was out of network seriously! that is not acceptable.

This was my first colonoscopy. As a nurse, I wanted a provider that was thorough and considerate of any questions that I may have.  Dr. Shelby and his office staff exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend this practice.<//Text>

Dr. Shelby Salim has been my doctor for over ten years and I have been extremely satisfied with his professionalism in the way he treats his patients.  He listens and appropriately responds to any health issues that I may have.  Recently when I had a colonoscopy, I was very impressed that the procedure started on time and the overall experience wasn''t bad given what that procedure entails.  I feel bless having him as my doctor and I would recommend him to anyone without hesitation.< /text>

Doctor Shelby is probably the kindest most concerned GI I have ever encountered.  Always concerned.  Always quick to follow up.  He makes a very unpleasant procedure tolerable and painless.  Thank you Dr. Shelby.</review>

<text>I am a new patient and I am, so far, completely and totally satisfied with him and his office staff’s  competence. They don’t seem to waist time and bring you in for extra appointments “just to see how things go”. Dr Shelby got right to the point on my very first visit and had me in two days later for a colonoscopy. He is very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. He isn’t a “let’s sit around and chat about your private business” but he is a no bs kind of doctor and I appreciate that about him. You can’t find that anywhere these days. He doesn’t prescribe stuff you don’t need and that’s even better. My previous GI Dr’s PA sent me home with Miralax when it wasn’t even the problem. Dr Shelby knew right away that it was the wrong thing to give me. No matter what happens, I appreciate his honesty and expeditiousness with my health issues. I highly recommend him and already have to my friends and clients.<//text>< rating>

I liked dr shellby when I used to go in get a colonoscopy,endoscopy and things were good, but if you have a problem he never but never calls you back! You can be in horrible pain, I’ve called for days, he never called back,nor did his office. He just likes to do procedures get his money, but has absolutely no bedside manner and truthfully he is a horrible doctor,never talking to his patients!!! What a difference, I am now seeing Dr.Gil and he is incredible,calls back immediately with any questions, actually talking to you!!!! Dr. Shellby doesn’t care for his patients at all !!!!< /Review>

It was OK, but I thought they kind of rushed me in/out, even though they were late & made me wait for my few appointments with them. Mediocre overall, and didn't love feeling like I was on a manufacturing line.< /review>

I had a Upper GI  Endoscopy, at the Executive Surgery Centre in Danville on the 20th of Sept 2018 at 0630 AM.
The checking in procedure was very smooth as the staff at the checkin desk was very courteous and pleasant.
The nursing staff were very helpful in answering my doubts. Dr.Shelby explained the procedure and after the procedure told me that everything looked normal, and asked to see him in a weeks time to assess the next course of action. Dr.Shelby is a very kind and pleasant Doctor and I will not hesitate to recommend him to my other family members and friends.< /review>
