The floor mat I need was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.   But the quality of the floor mat was not the same as the original.<//Text>

Once I figured out the correct part numbers, the process was efficient and the shipping was very fast.  I'm sure I will use this service again.< /text>

Site easy to use and ordering was easy! Good thing I had the part numbers for these special length bolts. All four bolts shipped fast within 2 days.<//Review>

<Text>I wish I could give 0 stars. We were sold a Toyota 4Runner and I sold in my PT cruiser. I had left my PT cruiser license plate on the vehicle and they sold my car with the license on. Now I am getting all these traffic violations. We called to talk to someone and they told us to bring the traffic violation in and told us they would handle it. They never handled it and I got more traffic violations. I am considering suing. When they initially sold us the car they tried to scam us with all these extra products etc. Moving through the paperwork took such a long time. I will never buy here again.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I live in American Samoa, a US Territory in the South Pacific and the nearest genuine Toyota parts supplier was this one in San Francisco, CA. The website was user friendly and I was also very interested  in their promise of Fast Shipping. We have 3 flights a week to our remote island and I’m used to items taking over 2 weeks to arrive however David S. shipped it and I received it in 5 days! I was mind blown. Not to mention the discount on the product. I can’t tell you how pleased I am with their service. I will be ordering from them for now on for any further parts for my Corolla!<//review>

I'm an online customer, only.  The best part is they will sell you parts.  The worst part is there's no one to ask questions (online).  Then when you want to return it, they give you a 15 day window to submit your return request and then don't reply to the request within the time frame.  The only communication I've had since the purchase is this survey.</Text>

I ordered a complete set of interior mats and a TRD re-usable filter for my 2015 Toyota Tacoma.  I received the parts in less than a week and all parts were correct per my order!  I installed the parts and they work as expected.
Thank you for your great service!  I highly recommend this parts department!<//Text>

Really bad service from the parts department. I ordered a $130.00 decal for my Rav-4 and was not in the box with the other things I ordered. I sent an email about the situation the parts department never responded. When I called he blew me off saying that it was in the box and I was out of luck. I wouldn't trust them to so an oil change much less buy a car from them. I'm Very Unhappy!<//Review>

VERY fast shipping and the part was exactly as I hoped it would be, new in its box from Toyota.

I'd certainly buy from them again - great price, great service.< /review>

<Review>Garlic Fried Chicken Dinner with Potato wedges was great. It took an hour to get. But they let us know that it would, when we ordered it.  If you've been here before you know that if your whole table orders chicken it takes about an hour. The good thing is they have a good bar, with a great bartender to socialize while you wait.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>We have eaten here often since the 1970's! Owned by the same family the entire time. Good comfort food, quiet atmosphere, lots of locals. Really good food and one of the few places where you still get a cup of soup and a small salad with each meal.

<review>Lived in the immediate areas my entire life and always assumed this place was only a bar. Well now I live basically across the street and I had to go check out this bay famous garlic fried chicken I've been hearing about.

We decided to go with the small bucket of garlic fried chicken that comes with 8 potato wedges which are 2 large potatoes that have been qartered. We couldn't be more pleased with what we received. The flavors of the wedges are great and last. Not like other chicken chains where it seems like you're eating straight potatoes. The chicken was heavily seasoned with garlic but surprisingly it's not overpowering at all. The garlic goes with the fried flavor perfectly. The chicken was moist and juicy and very meaty. I will be back with out a doubt . It's a very home-style joint that serves up some great comfort food and with relatively good prices.  The small bucket with 8 wedges was 16 bucks and the regular chicken is 15 I believe .<//review>< Pics>

Ricky's corner is probably the best well-kept secret in rodeo. In my opinion they have the best fried chicken in the region. Their small bucket has eight pieces of chicken and wedge potatoes. I don't think they ever advertise.it's a local dive. Great customer service great food</review>

Ignore my rating. Only posting to note that they are on vacation from July 29 thru August 8, opening on Wednesday the ninth at 5 PM. So, I haven't ever dined here yet. Looks like a fine place though. Several people stopped by asking if it's closed, while I was checking it out.< /Text>

Very slow and somewhat rude service. However I havr lived in Rodeo my whole life and people keep going back...time and time again. It must be the amazing chicken they have.<//text>

<text>I felt completely discriminated against because of the color of my skin. I as a regular customer was told that a small bucket consists of 2 breast pieces, 2 thighs, 2 wings, and 2 drums. But yet I was given 3 thighs which are smaller than a breast piece so I in the end payed equal price for less than what was promised. And I only felt that way because of my skin in a whites only restaurant.</text>< name>

<pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Review>Johnny gave me a well detailed clean cut shave along with pointers on how to maintain my beard in order to maintain it. No barber shop is perfect but so far I've experienced the closest barber shop to perfection. They atmosphere here is really up to you and how you want to experience, if you don't feel like being talkative that's fine but they will greet you and make you feel at home. Thanks Johnny and the rest of Valley's finest barber shop for making my first time a pleasant experience, you gained a new happy customer. Good labor isn't cheap and cheap labor isn't good so don't come in expecting to get some coupon prices but I can assure you that you will come out with a well detailed cut that will make you feel good.</Review>< username>

<review>It was my second time here, But the first time I came here the owner cut me up but this time Ryan gave me an even cleaner and way better haircut. No offense to the other barbers, Like I literally got the haircut I asked for and I couldn’t be anymore happier. He is very detailed and professional and can keep up a conversation and make you feel welcome and comfortable. I’ll definitely be stopping by soon. Thanks again Ryan!<//review>< pictures>

I gotta fresh cut here yesterday and called about getting a haircut and walked in and Ryan took me in his chair right away, Very professional, courteous and good vibes all around the shop and good conversations as well. I’m from Whittier and it was first time getting a cut in the valley so I was a bit skeptical. But Ryan exceeded my expectations and hooked it up with a very detailed and precise cut. I’m going to the army in 2 weeks but as soon as I get back I’ll be coming back to get a cut from Ryan. Thanks again guys!! 5 stars< /text>

<Text>It was my first time here. What a great spot. Highly recommended.
Randomly found it because it was open late on sunday. Very good haircuts, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. Josh spent some time perfecting every detail. Will definitely come back again! Thank you!< /Text><username>Sargis<//username>< resp>

<Review>This place was recommended to me by a friend who has been getting cuts from Mike, who works here for over 20 years now. I have a 2 year old, who has been getting his hair cut since he could sit up. I hadn't felt comfortable with many other places. I tried Lollicut for about 6 months, but unfortunately they messed up my son's haircut once and it was so horrible that I never went back. I tried Mr. Scissors and I didn't have a great experience with the unwelcoming staff there. To be clear, my son doesn't cry at all nor does he move around constantly while his hair is cut. After purchasing my own clippers, trimmers, etc. and taking matters into my own hands for several months, I decided to give Mike a shot. I couldn't have been more pleased. The fading and lineup were exactly what I wanted for him. Mike made my son and I comfortable. We are extremely grateful to have been referred to him.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I usually don’t get my hair cut or  beard trimmed to often because I’m always busy at work but call and made an appointment with Ryan. Gave me a clean buzz cut and great beard line up/trim. This is a hidden gem in the valley. Def have to come back and see Ryan again. Thanks!< /Text>

I am glad this crew opened up just a couple blocks from my house. called to see if they had capacity and was told I could walk in as there was no wait, although they prefer appointments. Levon was kind and courteous and hooked me up with a great cut in a very decent amount of time. Price was reasonable, and they accept cash or card. The vibe in here is great. They were playing some 90s music bringing my nostalgia on but it wasn't loud or obnoxious at all. Everyone was chill. They seem to be closed on Mondays and open 10 to 8 the rest of the week. I am not a huge fan of the parking lot but the plaza is connected to the Big Lots parking so that is very helpful. This spot will definitely earn some more business from me.< /review>

Ryan is the MAN.  He was meticulous in his work and I certainly appreciated how hard he strived to make sure my cut was nothing less than perfect. And he did not disappoint - thank you Ryan, you gained a client in me.<//Text>

<review>Soo guys.... I called about making an appointment but they said that they only do walk ins on sundays and soo I came by and was greeted by Ryan and took me in his chair right away. It was my first time here and I really didn’t know what to expect but I was like super blow away dude by Ryan’s skills with the those clippers and scissors let me tell you. This is one the best haircuts I have ever had in a while. If anybody in the valley is looking for a good barber shop go to Valley’s finest and you won’t be disappointed. Ask for Ryan he will get you looking like a million bucks guaranteed. All the other barbers look like they are good as well but over all great experience. I’ll definitely be back here.</review><rating>5</rating></record>

Responding to owners question, I am now giving 1 star becuase the fade I requested was much higher than asked for and was done in such a way as to have no choice but to move forward with it. Also to respond further to the owners response I was very explicit as to what I wanted. And to answer your question, any establishment with one money sign typically is around 17 dollars.
I have had haircuts for around 15 or 17 dollars that were better than this, and actually post there prices.
My mistake for starting a haircut that implied cheap but to find out it was not. And recieved a terrible hair cut.
Will not return.<//review>

They were more than friendly, loaded the equipment (and unloaded when I returned) cheerfully.  Price was completely fair and of course I would recommend their business again in a heart beat.  If I ever need any other equipment again, I would certainly contact them first.  I felt like it was dealing with good neighbors which made the transaction all the more completely great.< /Review></record>

Very impressed by the staff and selection of equipment. At times as a woman when I try to purchase or rent construction items I am treated like I have no clue what I am doing. Not the case here! They were super helpful and gave me tips and ticks on using the two man auger with out making me feel like I was stupid. Highly recommend and will be coming  back for more rental items as we do our home improvement projects.<//review>

I rented a roto tiller from them. The kind gentlemen working the counter got me in and out within 15 minutes. He showed me how it worked and even helped me load it. I will be going back and I highly recommend this place for all your tool rental needs.</Review>

<text>I rented a large wood chipper. It was well worn (as one would expect with a rental) but in good condition and ran just fine.   Service was friendly and they helpfully walked me through how the equipment worked.  I would seriously consider All Star Rents for any equipment rentals I need in the future.<//text>< user_name>

I rented a 60 pound Jack Hammer to remove old fence post concrete. The service was great and I would have given 5 stars but they only provided me with a single bit rather than a compliment of bits. This really made my job tougher to accomplish.  I hope that they offer multiple bits to future renters. Other than that issue everything was great.<//review>

<review>Rented a sander (square buff) for redo diy 70 year old floors. Equipment in great shape and fair prices. Definitely recommend. Don't bother with bigbox store. Also, employees are super friendly and very helpful. Glad we found All Star Rents!<//review>< rate>

<review>JUST MAKE SURE YOU ASK SOMEONE TO GO OVER THE VEHICLE WITH YOU AND CHECK THE MILEAGE. BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I DROVE 81 MILE.AND IT ADDS UP WHEN ITS 99 CENTS A MILE BUT  I ONLY MADE 2 TRIPS A FEW BLOCKS AWAY. OTHER THEN THAT THEY WERE AVAILABLE RIGHT AWAY AND THE CHEAPEST PLACE AROUND<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

People friendly, equipment good shape.  Requested military discount, and had id to verify it, that I have received many times there.  Requested 4 times inckuding on return.  Was told discount was taken.  Verified normal rental cgarge that was exactly what I was,charged.  Disappointed on that matter.</text>

<text>Cant say much on prices because ive never really rented stuff like this before but great selection of tools from simple hand tools to serious mechanized equipment topped off with friendly helpful employees! Rented a power lift dolly that made moving a 700lb 5'x3'x2' gun safe a simple 2 man operation including in and out of the bed of a truck. I rented for the day but couldnt make it back before close and they let me return it when they opened the next day for no extra charge. Would definitly use them again!<//text>< pictures>

My mom and sister and I visited this place on a whim because it was close to our hotel. It's a tiny little restaurant so not a lot of seating if you're planning to stay but stay and eat or take out, the food is REALLY good. My mom and sister both had gyros and I had a salmon salad. The owners were very personable and kind. Great senses of humor and who doesn't love a good laugh? My sister, who is a former pastry chef, also said this was some of the best baklava she's ever had.< /Review>

Absolutely delightful! I've walked by and seen this place fairly bustling around lunch and decided I needed to try it for myself. It's demure middle eastern/Mediterranean cuisine calling belies the richness and depth of flavor some of its dishes actually possess. I got the Zereshk Polo with chicken kabob having literally no idea what I was getting, and I am ecstatic that I did. The rice was a saffron, sweet delicacy and the chicken complimented it nicely. When I spoke with the owner about what was in the rice,I discovered it's some unqiue Iranian berry (kind of tasted cranberry ish). Regardless and I digress. Go and enjoy 👍< /Text>

<review>I ordered home chicken kebab and beef kebab, the meat stinks rotten, terrible not fresh smell. called the restaurant, they did not explain, hung up!

I wrote my review before the order was brought to me the second time. at the same time they talked on the phone (until they hung up that they had everything fresh) when they just brought the chicken kebab for the second time, the host of the Tzhe spoke differently: “yesterday’s stuffing, not fresh onions and dt”. They brought the order for the second time, after my friend called them and tried to sort out the situation, and they also didn’t talk very eagerly with her. the food you have unfortunately is not the most delicious.</review>< pics>

<text>Hubby says he can tell if I like a place if I'm making mmmm sounds and doing my happy dance in my seat. There was plenty of that going around during our visit tonight.

We walked in about 30 minutes before closing. There was one customer ordering to go. The owner greeted us very warmly and invited us to choose a table. We all ended up ordering beef louleh (koubideh) and Ikra appetizer. While taking our order, the owner introduced himself and thanked us for coming. Upon learning it was our first time, he came out with some bombdiggity tzatziki for us to try with our naan bread as well as some pickled veggies. Dude that tzatziki was soooooooo good. He put crack in it because I was licking the bowl! The louleh was the best we've ever had. Portions were huge!

Everything was so lip smacking good! We wish we lived closer cuz we'd definitely be regulars here! The owner was so gracious and hospitable! Highly recommended!!!< /text>< user_id>

Honest workers :)  I bought a used tire from here a few months ago that was flat a few days later, even though I hadn't even driven it.  The guy who sold it to me said, at first, that it was a used tire and the sale was final.  But after looking at the tire, realized that I honestly hadn't driven on it, and agreed to take it back. I ended up buying a new tire and am pleased with the product and the service I received.  Thanks guys! 🙏😊< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I’ve been here 5 months now, and I love it! I needed a place within our budget that is pet friendly, clean, and safe, and Laurel Heights suits our needs perfectly! Christina and Jasmine are so friendly and professional, and maintenance is very responsive to requests and always does great work. What first impressed us are the grounds and landscaping (and our amazing patio!), but the best thing is that our apartment feels like home. Neighbors are respectful and friendly, and the common areas are always clean and presentable. I’m happy to call Laurel Heights home!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1616553573056, 'text': 'Robin,\n\nThank you so much for the amazing review.

<Review>Due to a job promotion I was informed I needed to relocate. I was given a two week window period to make the transition.🤕 Like many individuals. I went online and begun the daunting process of locating a place that could accommodate my needs, wants, and desires:: Reasonable and fair (Rent)monthly payments, Hardwood floors, a clean and well functioning gym and pool, onset parking and laundry room,  pet friendly, yet clean from debris and trash, safe for children and open to guests,  no headache or hurdles when a maintenance issues arise. After endless emails and phone calls. I came across Laurel Heights apartment webpage. I had the wonderful opportunity to speak with Ms. Jasmine Griffin, Laurel Heights consultant. She’s super respect, patience and truly committed to ensuring residents and potential-residents needs are clearly addressed. For three months now, I am genuinely pleased with my decision to select laurel Heights as my place of peace and comfort to call home. For those looking for a place to call home. Give Laurel Heights a call. You won’t be disappointed. Best wishes....<//Review></record>

Staff has been great overall since taking over management. Carlos is out cleaning ever morning . Christina has done a great job bringing the community together and caring about the needs of her residents. This management crew has been the best in my 4 years living here .<//text>

<Text>Well what can I say but from Drab to FAB!!! Love  my new apt!! Very modern, very AFFORDABLE, NO Pests and NO insects! Property is very CLEAN and POOL area is very well kept. Gym is always clean and has the newest state of the art equipment.  Plus the computer room is always a perk, whenever I need a quick print out. Play park for kids and basketball court are always clean for the kiddos. Love the newly remodeled laundry room, night Security officer and appreciate that the barbecue areas are well kept for entertaining. Im very happy to see the trash dumpster areas have seemingly improved and there is plenty of parking. Neighbors are quiet and politely friendly. I have been here going on 6 years and this is the best management team yet and all I can say is thank you to Jen and her staff for always going above and beyond for your residents and making this by far a very pleasant place to live.</Text>< pictures>

I had an issue with my water very early in the morning and I thought I wouldn't be helped for a while.Within 10 minutes Carlos Martinez from matinence showed up and helped me better than I could have asked for. I had other issues I didn't even know about and he was willing to do more than I asked for with a smile on his face. Thank you Carlos!<//text>

<Text>They took me to court and I won my case. The were trying to give me an unlawful detainer and I just had to pay for damages. Nice try though.
Imagine paying for rent at an apartment you don't live at and live 100+ miles from.
Never again. Steer clear!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Don't do it !! overpriced, this is the worse building ever to live in they let anyone move in, the parking lot is full of trash and beer bottles and cans tenants arguing early morning and night throughout the day every other day loud music playing everyday ,throughout the day and night washroom stay filthy you have to wash the washers yourself before you wash your clothes homeless people sleeping in back parking lot , all outside trash bens are on fire every other month, infested with water bugs I have a permanent scar on my forehead had to go to the dr. because I had something like a blister which started out like a little bump and Dr. said it was a spider bite had to take antibiotics for two weeks. I reported this to the office and know one cared. I called to ask for someone to spray a month before this happened till this day know one showed and this was 8 months ago I am a single mother and now grandmother been having financial difficulties such as garnishment wages  no help or consideration from them all they want is they rent. I lived here for 4 years and all she could say is pack your things, REALLY!!

<text>Talked to a lady over the phone and was told that they had a third floor one bedroom apartment available for just over $1,000. She said to come in and nobody was there. The next day was MLK Day so they were closed and the day after they claimed that all of them were leased and because of "supply and demand" the rest were suddenly bumped up to around $1,200 for a one bedroom. Funny how that works.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

If you are planning to rent here, please don't! Worse apartments I have ever lived in. Overpriced, roaches, we pay for trash & trash containers are always full and furniture everywhere on the floor. Poor customers service at the front office, management loosing & misplacing rent money orders. Laundry is always dirty & loud neighbors. I will  rather spend a lil more but have a better place to live.< /text>

<review>I’m an honest person and will share my experience for new possible tenants because it’s very important as a customer to know exactly what to expect before making a long term decision. Unfortunately, we moved in last month and we discovered roaches, the quality of the apartment sucks, everything falls apart. On top of that, THE WATER is always being turned off! It’s tough when you have children or your in the shower and it suddenly turns off. Half of the time they don’t give you a water shut off notice. It’s currently 8:27 pm and the water has been shut off for hours now. NO NOTICE. Rent is overpriced for sure considering all of these issues. If your okay with this, then Laurel Heights is the place for you.</review>< Pics>

Rent is over priced, people are loud late at night arguing and cars alarms always going off, no body knows how to throw garbage outside (unless it’s the homeless trying to recycle) WATER SHUTS OFF AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK! People in the office are inconsiderate!!! This place really is ghetto & they are upgrading all apartments BUT please don’t get fooled these apartments are not worth the money because even then the area is bad! Oh and laundry is expensive. The washing machines don’t work well! Been here 5 months and I cut the least so I’m glad I’m moving out!</Text>

Water outage with no notice! This seems to be an on going occurrence here and worst of all there is no Emergency contact or number to reach for any sort of emergency like this! I got home tonight at 8. 0 clock its now 2 am in the morning and still no water !!! This just recently happened less then a week ago for 3 days straight I had no running water  nor did I receive any sort of warning or explanation why the water is off I don't wish these conditions on anyone ! Does anyone know who I can reach out to for some sort of resolution because I rather move then be subjected to living in filth and not being able to flushy my toilet at free will  its been over 5 hours and the stench of the sewage and funk of feacies is lingering throughout my apartment can't sleep need to shower amd be up early for work ! It's very sad not knowing if this os going to be another 3 day water outage:( !!!<//text>

I am a current resident, Do not move in!!! I noticed 2-3 roaches a day on the first week of moving in. It needs a major update. The apartment looks like it is from the 80's. Its very loud every weekend  there is a lot of dog feces in the grass all the time and when I tried to complain about it they told me that there was nothing to do about it. Maintenance is a joke, they cut off our water on short notice and when you first move in it looks like they just painted over the old previous paint so you get walls that look like they dripped dried. It looks disgusting! After my lease is up I am leaving immediately.

Update: As of March 2015, this is the most accurate overall review I am going to give before my lease expires in May. The neighbors and the staff are horrible and messy. The staff does not exist, they are almost always closed, plus the rent is about to go up without no notification or at least no one told me. They have a gate code. which is good. Its really good when they change the code without telling you and you find out after work at 3am in the morning when there is no one available. My neighbors are a nightmare, I got weed smoke downstairs, constant parties upstairs with random guest that leaves trash EVERYWHERE. I have complained before but still no change. I am really encouraging all of you to not move in here regardless of that message below me. I was misled by a message like that when I was trying to move in. Lets try to complain enough for them to change this or lets get this place a new manager that cares for future residents. Thanks.< /text>

<review>Experience here wasn't too bad for the price. Big negatives was the parking situation, no assigned parking so first come first serve, and if you get home around 9-10 P.M., good luck. also, no washer/dryer in the unit. and expect, loud noise all day and all night, with thugs smoking weed and having a "drink up" in the parking lot with water shut off consistently. Was here for 1 year and water was down at least 8 times. Also, staff ( Especially Jessie ) is very unprofessional and rude. Very snobby and was no help to the residence at all.</review>< Pictures>

<review>This has to be the worst complex in riverside. First they bait and switch the apartment when you sign the contract.

The office hours are a joke. They take two hour lunches and leave early, so if you have a job you can try to get to the office on Saturday since they are closed on Sundays.

As for the on premises laundry room, good luck. you have to use a card and the only place to load it is in the office. So if it's after hours and you need to do a load and don't have your card filled...you're screwed.

Make sure you keep every piece of documentation , they change your rental info and if you didn't keep it or can't find it  too bad...

Over all if you don't live on welfare ..try somewhere else.</review><rate>1</rate>< userid>

<rating>1</rating><review>I have been living here for about 6 years .At first is was not that bad until slowly things started to change . First management got rid of the security guard which caused a lot of car brake ins to happen. you will see a lot of homeless people digging through the  trash on a daily basis and a huge bin out by the back gate that has been there for months full of trash and furniture. The back gate is chained and not accessible to us residents and if there were to be a disaster you would not be able to go out that gate only the front . For example , the trash cans were set on fire  early last  year 2017..Twice and management just pained over the damage this week The apartments are infested with cockroaches and now rats and all they will do is keep fumigating but will not pay to actually cover the building . If you rent on  bottom floor  ( like me )  you have a higher chance of your apartment flooding like mine did due  to the old piping in this facility . Even  one of the main maintenance guys told me that there is constant flooding ..especially on the bottom floor. On top of that you are not allowed to have any storage on the patio, AND WITH LIMITED SPACE  where do they think we can fit all of our things?point is that even if you tell the front office they will tell you that it I not there call but the owners and they cant do anything about it  .  I'm a very clean person and I have proved that to management but no matter what I do they will not do more than  fumigate and that can be bad for our health  . Last but not least there is mold .  I'm finally moving soon and thought I owed it to the people that are thinking of moving here to know how bad It really is .< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Do not be skeptical of the bad reviews. Roaches weren't a huge problem, but they were there. Here's a rundown of our issues. 1. Plumbing issues 2. Poor or no response to said plumbing issues. Our toilet kept oozing out nasty white sewer water and we lived with it for months, continuously asking for it to be fixed. The floors were peeling from it. It wasn't until I filled out a survey sent to me from them where I complained about it and they actually fixed it (took 3 times to get it right). 3. Never fixed the dishwasher properly. 4. There's still a hole in the ceiling outside the bathroom because it leaked and flooded our apartment twice. 5. They locked away their phone. They will never answer you. 6. We cut off our lease because we're moving out of state. The lady said we have to give a 30 day notice to cut off the lease. There's a fee and accelerated rent on top of it. Cool but on the contract ending the lease, it doesn't say or show us the calculations of those fees. She just gave us a pink sticky note and wrote our fee we have to pay. The worst part is, we planned to move 2 weeks before the 30 days were up, but plans changed and we wanted to move out on the 30th day.. this other lady was rude and said no, we are only paying for the 15 and we need to get out of there..? Worst part is, they probably won't give us our security $ back since the multiple floodings in our apartment messed with many things. Btw.. $1130 for a 400 sq. ft. studio apt? Ridiculous.<//text>< pictures>

there is a $35.00 a month sewage fee....then gas,electricity and home insurance..... they also have horrible maintenance and paint over everything.  Whole tub is old and painted over, moldy and brown underneath the already peeling paint..   There is ALOT of roaches outside, but not in my appartment...yet... *edit*  lease ended and the next year they increased it by !$300.00 a month for year lease.  They took most my deposit even though apartment was in great condition.... they want people in and out for the money I believe< /Text>

This place would not  be so bad if it wasn't for a few things, the real complaint i have are the neighbors are super rude. The people above us let their kids ride scooters in the apartment and after asking over and over to keep it down they continue to do so and look at you like you did something wrong. the stomping goes on all day and all night without end, and when I asked the management for help with the matter it just got worse. this is no way to live. Three times this week the upstairs neighbors shook my apartment with with music blasting until well after 11 P.M. or after I went and asked them to turn it down if you move here you will be trapped in these situations, plus people keep stealing from my porch. Its a nightmare here when you live with loud stomping all day and all night, people stealing, the washing machines not working, and the water being shut off all the time.</review>

I lived in these apartments 8 years ago. Yes that's a long time ago but it got brought up so I wanted to check the reviews. Seems like nothing has changed. Roaches EVEYWHERE. I complained so much they finally moved me to a different apartment. I had the same exact issue. The entire apartments are infested. The lady in the office told me "well they can't hurt you" the problem will not get fixed until they tent the entire complex. Not to mention my son's bikes were stolen from our patio. We were on the first floor. the day of my move In they called and said my aparatment wasnt ready. All my belongings were in a uhaul on it's way. They "found" me an open apartment to move into. They are very unprofessional.  I finally was able to move out thank God.  A friend of mine lived there last year and they moved because if the roaches too. DISGUSTING!!!! DO NOT MOVE IN!</review>

<Text>Very poor management. Lived there 10 months, no copy of rental agreement, paid for community trash, apartment was infested with roaches no matter what I did maintenance took weeks to fix anything. And when I left no bill and no security deposit returned on top of now being forced to pay nearly $500 for a cut in laminate they replace after you move regardless of damage. This place is horrible I know hole in the wall places managed better and cheaper< /Text>< GmapID>

<text>I have left multiple messages regarding a scheduled tour and have yet to get a call back from management. Being interested in leasing, I had a few questions regarding the apartments yet I cannot speak with a single person because apparently they have stepped away from the desk every second of the past two days. Management like this is something I cannot tolerate and will now be signing a lease elsewhere. My advice, if you're going to lease here (Which I wouldn't recommend in the slightest) call well ahead of time because you won't make any progress otherwise. Unfortunately I can't give less than a 1 star rating or I would. I can say one thing however, management is definitely good at losing incoming tenants with there shotty communication. I'm glad I didn't sign that lease. I can only imagine the number of problems I'd be encountering if I had.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb6c8f1e6b6c7:0x581624c67ac5b48c</Gmap_id></record>

If I could give ZERO STARS I would.... I have lived at these apts for 4 years now... And let me just say it has been an experience. If you want to move somewhere where the water gets shut off all hours, and I mean all hours ( 11pm, 12am, 6am 7am 9am 11am 2pm 4pm 6pm... You get the hint...) Then by all means move into these apts. Code enforcement has been out NUMEROUS times because management turns the water off with NO NOTICE to tenants. I can't even count on one hand how many times I have gotten up for work in the morning and I was unable to shower because the water was shut off... And of course ZERO notice was given. Reason for these water shut offs, is supposed emergencies... Emergencies are one thing, but when your whole community is effected by the water pumps in your septic tank not working correctly, and the pumps were supposedly replaced in December, then fix the issue and get on with it... Don't half ass fix it so your tenants are the ones who get stuck with the no water because of it. They also raise your rent EVERY SINGLE YEAR... upwards of ten to fifteen percent. Cars get broken into in the parking lot nightly, management just apologies for it... No security at night, regardless of what management says... They have a courtesy patrol but no onsite security. Pedestrian gates do not work so people can come and go as they please without a code. These apts are full of drug addicts and management is aware, they do not care... They choose to look the other way as long as they get their rent. I can go on and on... There is also a REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER who lives in these apts, when I brought it to managements attention 2 1/2 yrs ago I was told there was nothing they could do because the SEX OFFENDER was a VISITOR and not on the lease. He is not a VISITOR but is very much a tenant as he lived 2 doors down from me on the second floor and I saw him on a daily basis, but like I said management turns their head as long as they get their rent...  But this is just the tip of the iceberg... Renters beware!!!< /review>

Roaches, water shut offs with no notices, animals running through the complex with no leash or collars, unsupervised children running around in the parking lot ages from 3 years old and up, there is a missing bar around the pool gate and the apartment has fixed this pronlem by puttung a flower pot in front of it (a small child could still fit through this gate whole), there is poop all over the grass, play ground has graffiti/profanity all on the inside of the slides and walls, front desk women are rude, all the gates around the apartment are broken,  ive seen doze of small roaches in the laundry room, the homeless go through the trash at night Leaving unopened trash bags and trash all over the place, phone calls are rarely answered or returned, there are 100s of stray cats in the parking lot at night, no notices when a package goes to the front office, there is no assigned parking, broken down cars and people who don't live here fill up parking spaces. Not to mention cars getting broken into.
When you first move into the apartment there are so many things that are missing or broken. For us, our window was glued shut, a screen was missing from another window, drawers in the kitchen were broken, no light switches work, plugs are all very loose, we have a leaky sink and I've got a feeling they will try to pin this on us...
These are just really bad apartments. 😕😕😕< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) So annoying, with these new owners, they have us without water for 2 days, and the worst is not, they always warn us about the same, and not even to bathe. And not even an apology. It's disgusting, this has been followed by us. We saw the water till 2 or 3 times a month.

(Original)
Tan molesta, con estos nuevos dueños,  nos tienen sin agua ya por 2 días, y lo peor no , avisan  siempre nos hasen lo mismo, y ni para bañarme. Y ni siquiera una disculpa. Es un asco,   esto nos lo hasen seguido. Nos sierran el agua asta 2 ho 3 veses por mes.<//Review>< pics>

Went there on a Friday evening. Open indoors. Very spacious and welcoming. For the area, they had a good craft beer selection on draft and in cans. Beertender was nice and attentive. Bands are also playing there. Overall, I recommend going here.<//Text>

<text>Stopped by for a night cap after dinner at nearby restaurant. Bartender was friendly, beer selection was good and reasonably priced. Giving it a good review as it quenched the thirst and made for a great end of the evening. If you are looking for a cold beer on a Saturday night in Exeter, I say give this place a go.< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Been here a few times and I enjoy every time. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Not the biggest beer selection, but they do have a few different ones I haven't tried before. I think it's great that Exeter has a place like this.

Update 9/7/19: I am happy to say they have improved their beer selection 😁.< /Review>

Exeter's newest on sale beer and wine license. A friendly, open, little place. The proprietors here should have no trouble winning a popularity contest with their only downtown competition, The Stag. The Stag has recently been sold into new ownership and THAT guy has delivered a horrible ambiance to that bar.< /Text>

I went to Dr. Silberman for a root canal.  I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect, and I did have a bit of anxiety about the procedure.  The office was very upscale, and the staff was incredibly professional and very friendly.  I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in.

Dr. Silberman is one the nicest people you will ever meet, as well as being a true professional.  He performed a detailed analysis prior to my treatment to be sure it was necessary, then laid out the step by step plan of what I should expect.

I was told how long it would take, and the cost involved prior to committing to the procedure.  It’s great to know up front exactly what will be happening, as to not be surprised at the end.

The entire root canal took about 45 minutes, including some x-rays along the way to confirm it was done perfectly. I laid back and watched the tv on the ceiling, with headphones on, and wasn’t even really aware of what he was doing.  It was a walk in the park compared to what I was imagining!

I give Dr. Silberman and his staff the highest of accolades for their work, and for making a root canal visit a pleasant experience.  Well done guys!!!< /review>

Always a kind and helpful greeting from reception to nursing staff to the "man" himself. Dr Peterson has carefully, precisely and compassionately dealt with my English teeth for many years and I am profoundly grateful. There is no other choice in the Temecula Valley. Period.<//Text>

<Review>Wonderfully friendly staff and doctor (Dr. Roe) that made the experience of a root canal as pleasant as possible. Though I can think of a thousand things I would rather do than get a root canal it is the only place I will ever go but hope to never see again.  (5) stars all the way!!< /Review>< rate>

From the ladies at the front desk to the doctor’s assistants and especially to Dr. Whitworth, you are in the best hands possible. This is my second time having to engage their services and I have a total ‘no fear’ attitude.

I had to have a root canal done and my dentist recommended for me to go here. The staff is amazing and they make you feel so comfortable! It was my first root canal and Dr. Silberman made sure to walk me through the process and made me feel at ease! Christine was also very helpful and Lia at the front desk was very welcoming. Throughout the whole process, Dr. Silberman checked on me and let me know what he was doing in the procedure. It was quick and painless and even afterwards, I had no pain or soreness, which was nice! I highly recommend getting treated here if you want top tier service. I'm someone who hates getting dental work done, but they made it fun!! I will definitely be telling all my friends and family to go here :)< /review>

SIMPLY THE BEST!

I was in incredible pain and they saw me right away- going above and beyond to address my needs immediately.

They are kind and compassionate, it's clear their hearts are in their work! Dr. Petterson has the best bedside manner. He really made me feel safe and taken care of. He is so genuine and is there to make you feel better. His whole staff looked after me while I was in their care, making sure I was comfortable and without pain. I couldn't have expected the care I received. There are few people in the medical and dental industry who are this caring and passionate about their work! They are fast, professional, and thorough. I felt so taken care of.

Don't shop around- they are the best!< /text>

I saw Dr. Patterson for a root canal today and I must say I was very, very nervous initially due to my experience with a failed root canal attempt with another dentist at another location a couple weeks earlier.   However, after speaking with Dr. Patterson, I elected to move forward with the root canal.  He explained everything and allowed me the opportunity to process the information given and to decide on my options.

Dr. Patterson and his assistant, Christine were both very nice and professional.  Christine had such a calm and caring demeanor.

Christine put on the classical music I chose to listen to for my ear piece and the rest is history. No pain and it was over in less than 30 minutes.  I literally fell asleep during the entire procedure and was not under general anesthesia.

If you have a fear of dentist and not a fan of root canals, you must see Dr. Patterson and the dental staff at Rancho Endodontics.  They honestly know what they are doing.  Dr. Patterson is the guy.

Awesome experience!!!<//review>

Dental work is never pleasant or can be referred to as fantastic. From appointment to reception/check in to procedure, everything was handled with care. Dr. Roe and her tech assistant did a fantastic job. If you need dental work beyond what your GP dentist can do this is the place to go. They are professional, highly capable and patient focused. Could not have asked for a better experience.< /Text>

I was literally TERRIFIED of having my first root canal. I had no idea what to expect and had only heard horror stories. Dr. Silberman and his team were AMAZING! I felt totally calm the entire time as he walked me through the process. And most importantly, I felt absolutely NO PAIN! Getting a root canal at Rancho Endodontics was a more pleasant experience than getting my normal cleaning. Seriously. I highly recommend them!</Text>

< Review>
I have had a couple of root canals in the past. They are not the greatest experience. I ended up needing another one. My periodontist referred me to Rancho Endodontics. I was given an appointment the very next afternoon. My root canal was performed by Dr. Roe, and I am beyond impressed! The professionalism of Dr. Roe and staff was remarkable. Dr. Roe talked me through every option available to save my tooth. I have never had an endodontist explain to me exactly what the game plan was for my root canals. She was gentle, efficient, and knowledgeable. I know I will need another root canal in the near future. I am extremely confident to return to Rancho Endodontics.<//Review>

<Text>Highly recommend this dentist. Dr. Petterson took great care of me as did all of the staff. Very personable, very professional, and very compassionate for their patients. This was one of my best dental experiences ever and I would come back any time as I would encourage anyone I know who needs dental work to come to this location. I cannot speak enough praise as to the quality of the procedural work they just performed on me. Thank you Dr. Petterson for taking great care of me.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Prior to my appointment I looked up Rancho Endodontics  and found unusually high ratings on Yelp, Google and Healthgrades.  I can understand why as my experience was no different, five stars all around.  Lea was very helpful setting up the appointment.  Dr. Roe and Christine are a great team performing the work.  Dr. Roe explained in detail what was going on with the tooth and the options.  During the procedure they both made sure I was comfortable and that I knew what was taking place.  One other thing is that everyone I had contact with introduced themselves, treated you as a guest and took time to talk to you.  Something you don't experience in medical offices very often.  They do treat you like family.  I will not hesitate to go back if needed.< /text><rate>5< /rate><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc821218dfdb39:0x263215d5a733415d<//Gmap_id><time>1540080830847<//time></record>

<review>The customer service I received from Leah was amazing. Being in customer service for many years I can be a little more critical because now a days it is hard to find someone who answers the phone with a smile and does not sound like your bothering them. Leah was friendly and knowledgeable in answering all my questions, over the phone and in person. But it does not stop there, Dr. Roe and her assistant Christine were also amazing. They explained everthing step by step which made me feel comfortable and at ease through the whole procedure.  I highly recommend Rancho Endodontist.<//review>< pictures>

Scheduling, treatment, post-op and referral were professional, polite and caring individuals serve their patients well.
Dr. Roe communicated everything in a manner which is clear and easy to understand. She applied her expertise in a kind and gentle manner while performing my root canal v2. Trisia was also extremely attentive and answered all of my questions. She is a bright spirit that gives you comfort. Debra added a special, personal touch to my visit.

Beautifully brilliant beyond belief! Before blasted bane brought blistering bandages ; blessings beset bountifully bright boundary between.

In other words, the greatest dental experience I have ever had, my thanks to Dr. Petersen and his wonderful assistant Michelle for guiding me through the procedure. I can’t say enough and I will spare you another soliloquy, I believe my point has been expressed, thank you.<//review>

I recently had a root canal done in January & it was such a pleasant experience. Right when you walk in the office you are greeted by warm smiling faces. The office itself is absolutely beautiful, such a comforting environment. Leah & Debra are always available to answer all & any questions you have & are amazing at coordinating insurance benefits. Michelle is such a comfort to have around, her energy is so genuine & makes you forget you’re even at the dentist. Dr.Silberman is beyond amazing. On my consultation day he answered all of my questions & made sure I was informed of my treatment plan. The day of my treatment, like most people, I was quite anxious. Dr.Silberman put all my fears to rest & made me feel so relaxed as we chatted the whole time about family & hobbies, before I knew it my root canal was done! They made sure to follow up with me in the weeks following to make sure I was doing well & of course I was doing great. Can not say enough good things about the office & staff! Thank you everyone for taking such great care of me!!</text>

Very thankful for Rancho Endodontics!!! I recently had a crown put in and was still experiencing a lot of pain. My dentist wrote me a referral to another office, but after reading reviews, I knew I had to come to Rancho! I am so thankful I went with my gut! I called into the office and spoke with Debra. She was able to book me in for an appointment on the same day! After x-rays and testing it unfortunately confirmed I needed a root canal. I was in shock but fortunately I was in good hands with Penny & Dr. Pettersen. I suffer from anxiety and they were incredibly kind and patience with throughout the entire process. Dr. Pettersen explained each step as he was performing the root canal and it put me at ease! If I ever need another root canal I will gladly come back! Thank you so much Rancho Endodontics!</Text>

I always think that if you are following the standard then you don't need reviews about how good you are. But these guys were so friendly and curteous that I had to do it!!! I have had good service from many establishments, but from one where I have to get my teeth fixed is a new one. They listened to all my needs and concerns and thoroughly explained what needed to be done. It's so rare for me to be in an establishment where there is genuine curteousy and friendliness that I just couldn't help myself.<//Review>< Rating>

After completion of a Root Canal Treatment, i  notice  beneficence,  and veracity was performed. I believe that Rancho Endodontics dr. is 5 star and resonably price.  Dr. Roe DDS 5 star she is superb and  Ms. Christine strong leadership presence 5 star, Rancho Endodontics high-performing team staff 5 star,  solid patient relationship leadership styles. Staff very friendly and they strive to provide quality care dental care. Shout out to Dr. Roe and Christine you'll shown elements that make a good leadership. 5 star

Humor:  In closing a good dentist(dr. Roe) never gets on your nerves:) 5 star</review>

<review>Dr. Silberman did my root canal and it was the best dental experience that you could ask for, all things considering. The office is very relaxing and Dr. Silberman made sure that I felt no pain during the procedure, to which I am very grateful. He also drilled through my crown so I didn't need to get a new one. Overall an excellent experience and if I ever need another root canal, this is the only place I'm going.<//review>< Name>

AMAZING PEOPLE! GREAT CREW! SUPER FRIENDLY AND CARING! HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR HONESTY, INTEGRITY, AND HIGH QUALITY OF WORK. I had a root canal job and I was one of a kind because my mouth couldn’t get fully numbed even though they tried with different techniques but they had my come back after a week to give it another shot and what was amazing is that they thought about me and were ready to try a totally different method which finally worked with me, thanks to Dr. Pettersen!!! The root canal treatment went really well, no pain during process. Dr. Roe worked so hard on saving my crown so I don’t have to pay for a new one and she made me feel at ease. She also took the time to answer my questions on the phone the next day. I can’t thank you enough and I really appreciate you all.

Found out unexpectedly that I needed a root canal.  From making the appointment, to sitting in the chair, to having the work done, I had a great experience with Dr. Pettersen.  He explained what happened to my tooth and why I needed the root canal.  First class experience, and watching TV while he was working was pretty awesome too!< /Review>

I had the most amazing experience at this office!! I have been a fearful patient of any kind of dental work before now. The entire staff here made me more than comfortable and less fearful of getting the proper care I needed for my teeth. The front desk staff (Debra) was very friendly and knowledgeable about all information I needed for my visit. There wasn't a question I had that she couldn't answer, she even went out of her way to help me with what I needed for my follow up care visit with my primary dentist. I highly recommend this office for any root canal treatments!</review>

<text>I had to have the second root canal of my life.  This one was seriously the easiest dental procedure that I have ever had - and I have had plenty.  The staff at RE is friendly and takes the time to make you comfortable.  Dr. Pettersen was assisted by Trisia today and they both took very good care of me, explaining everything they were doing, giving me progress reports, and going over everything that was done at the end.  The whole procedure only took 45 minutes, just as promised.  If you need a root canal, go here!  They are the best!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc821218dfdb39:0x263215d5a733415d< /gmapID></record>

<text>UPDATE: Just had another root canal and some other dental work done this morning.  Again, the absolute best place to get dental work done. Prior to finding this office, my stress would start days in advance. I woke up this morning with zero stress. Leah and Dr. Roe are just the best there is. They are like the Batman and Robin of root canals. You will not be disappointed.

By far the very best dentist office in Riverside County. I have pretty bad dental anxiety and avoided going for almost 10 years. When I finally did go I was told I needed two root canals and was referred to Rancho Endodontics. Dr. Roe and her staff are amazing. They completely eased all the fear and anxiety I've had about the dentist for my entire life. The dental treatment took two visits, the first visit went so well that I had ZERO anxiety at the second appointment. You know you have a great dental specialist when you hope the toothache you have needs a root canal so your general dentist has to send you back. If Rancho Endodontics offered general dental services, I'd go every year. Dr. Roe and her staff...the best.</text>< response>

I am was very impressed with this Dentistry/Endodonics Office and the skills of Dr Pettersen. He is one of those Doctors that enjoys his work and it shows! Staff was great and without exaggeration the most organized and technically up-to-date facility I have ever seen. I am from Orange County (Newport  Beach) and am not used to such a patient oriented operation. They took their time with me and it was unlike the burnt out practices that I have experienced in the past. Highly recommended, Best Endodonics Murrieta/ California😀<//Text>

First time in my life I've had dental work done where they did only what was medically necessary and actually SAVED me money.  The staff is courteous & professional and Dr. Silberman is incredible.  I do believe he's the first DDS I've ever encountered that actually made me feel like he truly knew what he was talking about, actually cared and wasn't just out for a quick buck.  When the next root canal is needed, and, sadly, there will be a next, I won't hesitate to go back to Dr. Silberman.  Five Stars all the way.< /review>

<Review>We've had a great experiences with Dr. Silberman and staff. They really care about their patients and it shows. They fit me in whenever it fits my schedule best, office staff and dental staff is fabulous and Dr. Silberman is great with my 7 year old son. Definitely the best office that specializes in Endodontics in the Valley.</Review><gmapID>0x80dc821218dfdb39:0x263215d5a733415d<//gmapID>< Resp>

I had an amazing experience at Rancho Endodontics.  From the moment you walk into their gorgeous office suite, you are welcomed by a spectacular staff and an inviting treatment experience!  Debra, Christine, Michelle and Heather are so professional.  It is clear they care about taking care of their patients.  Their dental operatories are state-of-the-art and Dr. Pettersen's chair side manner put me at ease immediately.  He explained the procedure thoroughly and he did what he said he would do.  The next thing I knew I was done.  He was exceptionally professional, kind and caring.   You cannot go wrong with Dr. Silberman, Dr. Pettersen and Dr. Roe.  A big shout out to the entire team at Rancho Endodontics.  I'll never go anywhere else for treatment!< /Text>

I have been here for 2 root canals in the last 3 months.  I am really happy with the results, especially when they were able to get me in right away when I was suffering badly.  Dr. Silberman is outstanding when it comes to explaining what needs to be done and how he will do it, with an emphasis of relieving the pain as soon as possible.  I was shocked at how fast the root canal was done while at the same time very effective at eliminating the problem.  And I am probably one the most difficult because of a fourth root found in both teeth.  Yet, Dr. Silberman was able to adapt and adjust so effectively.  And thanks to his assistant Trisha for all of your help and patience.  I will one-hundred percent go back if I have any more problems</Text>

I had a partial Root Canal performed today and my Dentist sent me to Doctor Adrian Silberman (Endodontist) to complete the Root Canal because my Dentist couldn't get deep enough. Adrian Peterson performed some test and informed me that he would not advise doing the Root Canal because the tooth was cracked. He performed some tests with a microscope and light and actually showed me the crack that could no way be seen otherwise. He and his staff are very professional and knowledgeable  I would recommend Rancho Endodontics for anyone in need of a Root Canal. Great job Adrian Silberman.< /Text>

<date>1503510965138< /date><review>BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!!!!!  From the moment you walk in the door of Rancho Endodontics you feel welcomed with a beautiful, relaxing and clean customer area.  Not only is the customer area welcoming but the entire establishment is clean and friendly.  You are then welcomed by the staff at the front desk.  Amazingly, you feel as if you’ve known them your entire life, that’s how super friendly they are.  Everyone from Debra, Leah and Dr. Adrian Silberman are professional in every aspect and pleasurable to be around.  Although, I had the dreaded root canal done this morning, it was handled with extreme professionalism and care.  Dr. Silberman is nothing but “AWESOME”.  Every single step that he does is explained in detail to familiarize you with the procedure being done.
As an added bonus, the television on the ceiling with headphones (direct TV) was a wonderful addition to put you at ease.
In addition, DO NOT go here in a bad mood, because {I warn you}, that mood will be turned around to a happy one.  If you are looking for a great Endodontist this IS the place, and Dr. Silberman IS the Specialist that you will definitely want to see.  I guarantee that you will leave there one happy client.  This establishment and the folks who work there are “SECOND TO NONE”!!!!!  I Love this place so much, that I will be stopping in from time to time just to say hi.< /review><rate>5< /rate>< Resp>

Dr.Silberman and staff are great! I couldn't have asked for a better place to have my root canal.  Leah was awesome she made sure I was comfortable throughout the procedure. Dr. Silberman  is the BEST.  I must say I am very pleased with the services I received today.  I highly recommend Dr. Silberman for any Endodonitic services.< /Text>

If I could give more stars I would! Absolutely exceptional work done by Dr. Petterson and his assistant Michelle!! I'm a veteran and was referred by the VA to this place because the VA's Endodontist was unable to see me and I needed a root canal done ASAP. From the start I was comfortable after being greeted by the front desk. Once in the chair both Michelle and Dr. Petterson were both very kind, compassionate and most importantly professional! I did not feel a thing the entire time and I even got to watch ESPN while they did their thing. I highly recommend this establishment!!

Thank you Dr. Petterson and Michelle!<//review>

I highly recommend Dr. Akhil Sharma.  He is a very knowledgeable and informative pediatrician that has great bedside manner with infants, and is personable with adults.  He answered all of our questions, and relieved our fears.  He performed an in-office circumcision on our baby boy, which went well.  The procedure was uncomplicated and our boy healed as expected.  My wife and I were very happy to find him during our time in the area.</text>

Staff is either lazy or incompetent.

My daughter had an x-ray scheduled for this morning.  Dr said we were doing the morning appt so that results would be avail same day.  This was important because we need to know if the bone is broken to know how to proceed.

My wife called 3 times throughout the day to find out the results and if we were being referred to ortho.  She was told to call back at 4pm.  Upon calling at 4pm she was put on hold again for quite some time.  When the office personnel came back on the line she was told sorry did not receive the results.

Ok, so my wife then called the imaging facility directly and confirmed they were in fact sent at 1:50pm.  So, a fourth call yielded no information, still.  My wife was told sorry the Dr has left for the day.

Dr Sharma is a fantastic Dr but unfortunately, patients will be driven away by the rest of the staff.  We will be speaking with the Dr and/or office manager.

It really is not comforting when the staff does not seem to care much when dealing with the health of their patients.< /Text>

I just figure i put up with them for a moment and they will most likely be gone on my next visit because they know its not for them.

Dr Sharma is a wonderful Doctor, we've been taking our kids there for 15years. However in the more recent years the front desk staff is becoming a joke! There is no reason to keep anyone on hold for over 45 minutes or not return a call after 4 voicemails are left. I too work as an office assistant so I know they can do better.<//text>

Absolutely, love  Doctor. Dr. Akhil Sharma. He's kind, honest, and extremely professional. He always takes the time to listen to my concerns.In addition, he makes my kids feel welcomed and special. The staff has improved throughout the years. However, the wait time to speak to someone, can be frustrating. When I do speak to one of the receptionist, I am able to get an appointment.< /review>

Christina (receptionist) is very rude. She has so much attitude and rolls her eyes as you are speaking to her! I would not recommend this Drs office to ANYONE! It’s over a 2-3hr wait with an appointment!!! Also the phones are always busy! Your on hold for over 20-30min! Or the lines are just busy to Just schedule an appointment that will be 4-6 weeks of the day you call! They accept walk in but you will wait over 3 hours to be seen! This office is a joke! I’ve never been so disappointed!<//Text>

<text>We love Dr. sharma. Yes it is a bit of a wait but it is so worth it. He’s a wonderful doctor who takes the time to make my kids feel comfortable and answers all my questions or concerns. I would wait 3 hours for him. His office staff is wonderful as well. Always smiling and very courteous. Keep up the good work.<//text></record>

<text>We Love Dr.Sharma he's Awesome very friendly an he is ALWAYS makes my child with special needs comfortable. But It is very hard to get an appointment with Him. An his staff is more then unprofessional. From the min you walk in the door. In 6 years I could say there's been about "2" staff that were friendly. But Dr.Sharma is worth putting up with not so much great staff service</text><GmapID>0x80c366dc8748ba15:0x13679a4019c24bfe<//GmapID><Resp>None</Resp><username>M T< /username><Rate>5< /Rate><date>1534201409854< /date>< Pics>

They should open the doors here by 7:30 at the very least seeing as they start taking appointments by 7:45 or 8:00 instead they open doors after 8 leaving parents with their children outside!!! The staff is just terrible and although dr. Sharma is good this makes him look bad.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I give the doctor himself a good 50 star rating. But his office jack offs are something else. Never answer phones, they are never helpful. One more than one occasion have been rude to me and my wife. The untrained and undisciplined. But like I said once you get past the dumb*ss’s in the front you kind of forget about it once you see dr Sharma and the fact he won’t rush you and make sure your needs and wants to your child(s) is taken care of< /review>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Dr. Sharma is the best pediatrician in the High Desert, he has seen all three of my daughters (two from birth) and I couldn't be happier with the service and care that his staff provides.  My daughters all love him and my oldest daughter is upset that her time with him and his staff is almost done.  I only wish that he also saw adults that way the whole family could receive the excellent care that our little ones do.  His bedside manner with his patients is amazing, and he is always so helpful no matter how "stupid" a question you might have to him they are all valid and important.  I can't say enough good things, it all seems to fall short of how wonderful a doctor he is and his staff is always friendly!</review>< pics>

<review>Love the doctor, he is very personable with his patients (the kids) and parents. I'd give him 5 stars if it wasn't for his office staff. If you leave a voicemail, guaranteed you will not be called back. Referrals get lost in the shuffle (due to 'miscommunication'). When calling the front desk, expect to be on hold for at least 25 minutes (I am going on over 30 minutes right now..). I was warned when I was looking for a doctor that his office staff is bad, but the doctor himself makes it worth it. You'd think years of people complaining about the staff, changes would be made.. If you like a fast, friendly, communicative office staff in a doctor's office, then this may not be the doctor for you. However, if you don't mind, then I'd recommend him highly.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<rating>1</rating><Text>It's very difficult to put a call into this pediatrician office. Rated the #1 pediatrician for 4 years in a row, but they put blocks on their phones so the calls go to the message machine or they cut their phones off which give you a message saying the the Verizon wireless customer you are calling cannot be reached at this time. Just switched pediatricians thinking this would be a better fit for our family. Far from the truth! Dr. Valencia's office was much better at answering their phones and helping with any concerns for my child. I regret switching!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I absolutely love Dr. Sharma from the moment I met him at the hospital after my son being born and has been his doctor for 6 years. Unfortunately i have had to deal with the staff as well for 6 years and it's not always the best experience. Still recommend Dr. Sharma any chance i get.< /Text>

Dr. Sharma is amazing with my son. He's seen him for many years now and my son loves it when we walk in and he says, "Hellooo Prince (insert my son's name here)." He is great with the kids and always takes the time to listen to and answer our questions. The office can be really busy and the wait time in the lobby can be really long, but it's definitely a testament to how great he is as a pediatrician... everyone wants to see him.</text>

Wow looks like I'm not the only one having a problem with this office. Love love Dr. Sharma. He's amazing & been amazing with both demeanor & thoroughness with my kids. Unfortunately, his staff is inept, unprofessional & down right rude. Lied to today telling me they've had some office problems for a few days when apparently it's been going on for weeks. They won't return phone calls to confirm appointments. Won't return phone calls when your child has an emergency. Won't return calls when your child needs to be seen same day. While I was trying to explain my son needs to be seen he's very ill & had been on  hold for over 10 mins this ignorant immature uneducated little girl hung up on me. Sad & pathetic I need to find a new doctor for my kids after being with him for 6+ years. I think complaints need to be filed with my insurance company & whomever else deemed appropriate.</review>

Multiple calls not returned and I've been left on hold for LENGTHY periods. Today I was left on hold for 35 minutes. When I finally hung up and called back, they were closed, of course. Another time, my daughter was given additional, unnecessary shots because they had her MIXED UP with someone else. He's a wonderful doctor when you get to actually see him, but it's usually a P.A. or nurse practitioner. It's time for us to find someone else.<//Text><Time>1508456738272</Time><rate>1<//rate></record>

Wow you really can't get anyone to answer the phone. We have been with Sharma for 10 years now and it has only gotten worse. You have to make an appointment via a portal now? That information would have been nice to know whenever they changed it. This place is terrible at communication. Taking my business elsewhere. Wish there was a zero star option. I should say that Dr. Sharma is a super nice dude but you only experience that on the rare occasion that he sees your kid we've gotten the nurse practitioner most of the time.</review>

Have an appointment for 1030 get to triage room at 11 and then told to wait for an open room. Don’t understand what the point of making an appointment.

< Review>
if I could give 0 stars I would. Had to change doctors due to our pediatrician retiring. Read great reviews on this doctor so I decided to go here called and did everything I had to do for insurance. Called to make an appointment no answer for a week left numerous messages not one call back. finally got ahold of someone for my daughters shots that are now late. Went to the appointment only the PA wes there. I was told that day if your child needs to be seen you can go to the office early they only take the first 5 walk ins then it's urgent care. went early this morning because my daughter is coughing uncontrollably waiting in the cold to be one of the first 5. I was the first one in to be told that she can't be seen because the doctor is not in only the PA and she can't see walk ins. They sent me to an urgent care 15 min away to be told they don't take my insurance really that office needs some serious help. I never met Dr Sharma nor will I now time to change Doctors again.</Review>

<text>Dr.Sharma is an awesome pediatrician! The down fall and reason I only gave them one star?
His staff! His staff makes him look so bad!
Long story short: they submitted referrals to see a urologist. No one contacted me about it, didn't even tell me he needed to see a urologist! This was back in July and I just found out about that. On top of that when I called trying to find out about my sons ultrasound results I was told everything was fine. Ok... fast forward to months later at my sons 9 month appointment Dr.Sharma told me his results weren't ok and his staff should have notified me! Let's also get into insurance now! His staff notified me the day before they were no longer taking my sons insurance, ONE DAY NOTICE! I also wouldn't have known had I not called so they actually would of never notified me that they weren't taking his insurance anymore had I not called them!
Now? I've been on hold for 35 frikn minutes just to find out if the referral has been approved because ya know, they had to do that a second time!
These people are incompetent!<//text>< Pics>

Dr. Sharma is a great doctor and caring with his patients. We love going there due to our daughters medical issues. Unfortunately his staff is very rude and unprofessional. They do not answer phones, return phone calls, fax medical papers to wrong places or not at all. They also are not helpful at all with answering questions and lie to patients when trying to make appointments for sick children. I have brought this up to his staff a few times now, but nothing has changed. Looking into changing Doctors due to staff and filing a complaint again with the insurance company. Sad such a great doctor has the worst staff up in the High Desert for we have so few.<//text>

i have been taking my one year old and two year old here since they were born, and i have seen Dr. Sharma no more than three times. us, along with every other patient here deal with his nurse practitioner 98% of the time. My wife and i dont really mind, because she is absolutely amazing, but it would be nice to see the actual doctor once in a while. The staff could be better, but we go to this place for the doctor (that we dont even see) not the staff. Good luck actually getting in touch and speaking to someone when you call the office. If you get lucky and get to talk to someone, the women who you talk to are rude and make you feel dumb for asking basic questions. Be prepared to wait AT LEAST 30 mins on hold, and if you get sent to the voicemail after waiting 30 mins, it informs you "our mailbox is full and cannot take any messages, thank you, goodbye."< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Worst office staff. Can't do their job and fax or put in right codes for the ins. They have a ugly way of dealing with you. Never phone calls back. Can not ever get my kids in to see doctor anytime they need to be seen have to take them to urgent care always. I would not take my gold fish here.< /text>< pictures>

Been with doctor Sharma for 7 years now. Have 0 complaints and only great things to say about him. But I’m starting to think about switching ONLY because of his staff. Been calling 4 days straight multiple times throughout the day to make an app for my very sick child and not once have they not even answered the phone let alone call back. I go to school full time and work full time as well so i Can’t be going in person everytime I need to make an app with their doctor when they’re being paid to answer the phone. Not sure if anyone reads these reviews because i’m not the first nor will I  be the last who complains about this but I haven’t seen anything done it’s getting worse as a matter a fact because they used to at least answer after holding for an hour or so now there isn’t even an answer. I hope the doctor or someone in management sees these reviews and does something about it because it will reflect on him loosing pts thanks to this staff.<//Review>

My kids have been Dr. Sharma's patients  for the past 8 years, his a great doctor.. The only problem is his front desk receptionist whom apparently is unproffesional and has problems answering phones calls. For three weeks I been trying to make an appointment for my kids and no answer; once I finally  got through, the female employee told me to hold on and hung up on me. I called the doctor's office three more  times  and she finally answered; I asked her to please not to hang up on me because she was putting me on hold once again. She sounded upset and offended from what I told her and put me on hold for 20 minutes. Once she answered she was rude and tried to hang up on me when I wasn't done making my appointment for my second child..I have never in the 8 years I been with Dr. Sharma had problems with his front desk staff; his the only reason I still have my kids as his patients but his front desk secretary needs to be talked to...</Text>

5 stars for dr sharma NEGATIVE STARS for his staff including the lady that helps him.. I hate that I have to specific that I want an appointment w the dr like no duh that's why I chose this doctor. He's the only reason I deal with the rude incompetent lazy staff. Today was the last straw, I walk in cos it's 9 am and instead of going to emergency for my son who's going on his 3rd day w a fever she didn't care...she said it would b a few hours..I said ok can u ask doctor what he would like for me to do...and the girl Janice I think her name was (she looks African or Puerto Rican idk) she just says "well he's busy and I can't leave my seat to go ask him" like really??!!!! Ru serious !? I better stop writing before I get myself in trouble ...either hire more help or BETTER help!</Text>

<Text>We had a delicious 3 course meal and drinks to-go to top it off! The fried calamari was light and delicious alone or with a sauce. The steak was cooked to well-done perfection, husband approved! The salmon was sooo amazing. I'm getting that next time! I made believers of my two best friends tonight. Well done, Macaroni Grill!!  👏🏼😁< /Text>< Pictures>

Service was good as best it can for only one waitress on staff for 6 tables. Pasta was over cooked as well as the shrimp. It has been better. Room for improvement.< /Text>

This restaurant is a disgrace the food was served to me raw on mothers day and took over an hour to come to my table. The manager simply said the most he could do was give me a free desert. The service was terrible and the manager simply has no customer service skills and does not know how to run a successful restaurant.<//Review>

Ordered curbside. The Lasagna Bolognese is $18.00 and that's all you get, a sliver of greasy/oily lasagna. No bread that Macaroni Grill usually gave at each meal, no soup or salad? (Well you could for another $2.50) I understand we all have adjusted because of covid living, but If this is a result of that at least make the adjustment to the pricing as well.  Definitely NOT worth the money.  This is a rip off. Don't think we'll be coming back here.< /text>

My husband started to order his drinks 2 at a time since the wait was so long. The food was cold and also took a long time. The waitress was nice, but hardly checked on us. The place was not crowded, but I am guessing they are under staffed. Also, it did not help that she was new.<//review>< Pictures>

One hour wait and got no food. Waiters chatting with each other without even bringing bread to our table. Place was not full, even accounting for empty tables due to social distancing. Dirty plates. Left after staff said it'd take at least another 20 mins to get our food. Unprofessional staff that didn't address any of the issues.< /review>

The order I placed for delivery was missing a salad and the macaroni and cheese bites appetizers.  I had to call 3 times and was placed on hold for over 10 minutes each time.  When I finally spoke to Katherine to explain the missing items from the order, she only offered a complimentary appetizer on the next visit.  The items I paid for, and missing, were more then 1 complimentary appetizer.  Only after insisting I get a refund for the items I did NOT receive, rather than a "complimentary appetizer" did Katherine agree.  Not to mention I tipped on the total order , including the items I never received.  Terrible customer service!< /review>

I'm going to give this particular Romano's Mac Grill a 5 star bordering on 4 tbh. 5 only bc the wait staff was very nice and extremely hard working. This particular night was semi busy. The staff worked off of each other making sure the customers were well taken care of even if they were passing by another staff's table. Very friendly and warming from all of them. And considering it was outdoors, the staff did thier best to keep our cups full.

I found it unusual that they didn't have menus and we had to look at our phones to look at thier website to see the menu. I don't particularly care for this system.

The food was pretty good for a chain restaurant. I opted for the Trio Plate and the Bisque as a starter. The Bisque was a tad salty. I was offered another bowl but felt I already had to much sodium for the night. The Trio which consisted of Fettuccine Alfredo 8/10, Lasagna7/10, and a Chicken Marsala was decent 6/10 (it was kinda burnt). I was happy my plate came out nice and hot. My daughter had the Spaghetti and meatballs. It tasted decently good as well. 8/10.

I'd probably go back again. If I do I'll give it another review update</text>

<review>Food delicious, but overpriced.  I ordered a build my own pasta, with fettuccini noodles, alfredo sauce, garlic, broccolini, and tomatoes.  My bowl was only sealed on one side, and came with the wrong noodles! It was not full.  So I waited for 30 minutes (10 mins on hold) for a tiny bowl of pasta that was not even right.<//review><gmap_id>0x80dcb8e572fe65c1:0xd449daf3d68fbd40<//gmap_id><Rate>3< /Rate></record>

Like most chain Italian restaurants it's ok,  nothing special.  A solid B-, but if you know what real Italian food is like then a B is a decent grade. Like mexican and other ethnic food restaurants, the "hole in the wall type places are the best, with a few exceptions of course.</review>

I was doubled charged for the entire meal!!!  My wife and I dined there in the patio area on 8/21/2020 and all was fine until the next day when I noticed on my bank statement that I was doubled charged, one charge was with tip, the other fraudulent charge was without tip. After many phone calls to the restaurant and many conversations with the manager (Ruben), he assured me that they would take care of it.  Nearly two weeks later I spoke with Ruben again and he said they processed the refund but the reason I don't see the money returned is because my bank is withholding it for some unknown reason.  Long story short, I contacted my bank and filed a dispute.  Currently waiting up to 30 days for this to be resolved.  Anyone reading this, be careful and review your charges after dining at this restaurant!< /text>

I love the unique style, food flavorings and varied entree choices this place offers. The bread is unique and delicious. The dishes are all full of flavor, far from bland. The best richest soups ever.  The ambience is lovely and the service is always friendly and fun.</Text>

Chrissy, our waitress, was truly amazing. She was personable, kind and very helpful. The food on the other hand was not that great 🙄. They changed their yummy old recipes to something that's is obviously cost effective but unfortunately that compromised the taste. They also made the portions much smaller now . Not a good move as loyal clients who choose to come to Romano's over any other Italian restaurant will be able to tell.
The kitchen was out of a couple ingredients which affected their appetizers and dinner selections.
It was an ok experience because of our waitress. She was awesome. We probably will not go back again as the food is not as we were expecting and used to. 😒</Text>

Really bad experience here order online to pick it up at the restaurant, so i arrive at the restaurant 5 minutes later the order should be ready, but the order wasn't ready and i had to wait 15 more minutes.
Make sure before you came if you order is ready cause if your hungry and kids waiting for dinner at home.<//Review>

<review>Our experience tonight was horrible. I used to love Macaroni Grill, but I will never go there again. We ordered calamari. When the waitress brought it, she apologized for it taking so long, but they had burned it. The cooks intended for it to be served, but our waitress made them redo it. It was still pretty bad. My Chicken Parm was charred on the bottom, but it was served. Our waitress spent 20 minutes chit chatting with customers a couple of booths away. During this conversation, we couldn't get any service. Tonight was the first time in 25 years that I tipped less than 20%. I keep thinking I should have tipped less than I did. The place was nearly empty and now I know why. Hopefully it will fail soon and be replaced by something good. It's a beautiful restaurant.</review><user_name>Frank Johnson</user_name>< Resp>

My wife and I ate at the Corona Calf. location
this afternoon. Our first time eating at a Macaroni Grill. We chose it because we had
Christmas gift cards to use. What a delight!
They had a Valentines Special going on. I had the Salmon and my wife had the steak. Long
story short, the food was fantastic, the place nice and clean and “Jordan”, our server was
best we ever had! She was very nice, attentive and genuinely friendly. If you’ve never been there, do yourself a favor and go! We will return for sure.</Text>

<text>Used to love coming here for an Italian meal since it's close but this last time made that completely change... got there kinda late (around 8) and there was maybe 5 other tables were seated, there were 4 of us and instead of seating us at a booth when about 90% of them were open, we got a table and asked to be switched to the booth right behind myself. We got seated and the first thing I realized was they need new booth seats because I had a spring was up my a** the entire time. We ordered our drinks, I personally got a glass of wine and water and I wasnt carded when I still look like a 19 year old (I just turned 21 a few months ago) but I didnt really care and my brother brought it up lol. Then looked at the menu and was suprised how expensive it's gotten,  about $16(If I remember correctly) for a plain fettuccine alfredo which made me feel uneasy afterwards and no small salad or soup with your entree anymore? When my brother asked about and the waitress argued with him over it. Never got a refill or asked if I wanted one throughout the entire meal start to finish. The portions are much smaller now than in the past and lower quality in my opinion. The only good thing I can say is the tiramisu is still good. I'd rather drive the 30-45 minutes to Newport and eat on the water since it's only about 10-15% more expensive than here with drinks. Hopefully it can get better but I, nor my family will go back until its recommended by someone I trust.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dcb8e572fe65c1:0xd449daf3d68fbd40<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

We have been going to romano macaroni grill for quite some time. They have a really nice staff, but our waitress Hailey was absolutely amazing. So kind and she was constantly checking in on us. Positive attitude and big smile. We believe she did an amazing job. Thank you!<//Review>

< review>
I was craving pasta last night and I first called Chili’s and got put on hold for over 5 mins, so I called this place, Romanos, instead and promptly got put on hold again. This time, instead of elevator music playing in the phone while I waited, I could hear the woman who answered the phone and her male coworker talking about how she should be in the adult film industry. I brushed it off as something I misinterpreted over the phone, but a few moments later they continued the conversation and it was unmistakable that that’s what they were talking about. Apparently they didn’t know I was able to hear every word they were saying. I hung up and just went somewhere else and ordered in person. I thought a classy, expensive restaurant like this would have service to reflect their high prices, but I guess not.<//review>

I feel like the food isn't as good as it used to be. Our service was great though. Everything we asked for she took care of right away. She took great care of us. If they change their menu I would come back.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Thanks for ruining our valentine's day- We waited for almost an hour, although we had a reservation. They are clearly not set up to handle days like these. I went and checked with the front door waitress a couple of times to see if our turn came. She would say" no not yet, no not yet. We are still seating earlier reservations ".But, I started seeing walkins and people with reservations later than us getting seated and I went and asked her. She unapologetically said" yea, we missed to seat you as we are extremely busy and have so many people in the list". I was like, what?? I wasn't upset that she messed up and didn't seat us when our turn arrrived. But, her behaviour was unapologetic and rude. This is just unacceptable. We felt humiliated infront of tens of people. We didnt want to make a scene and so we went and got seated. Even the food wasn't great and totally not worth the wait. No thank you.

First time we came here for Thanksgiving it was amazing so we came back today for Christmas not such a great time . My mom's pasta had hardly any sauce or seafood. My fish was just ok and on top of a bowl of gneoki no tamatos and drowning in olive oil . The gneoki was so hard and dry could not even get a fork through it .  By the time everyone was done eating my stomach started cramping . Horrible food . The server hardly came to our table . Didn't get refills or a Togo box. F she never returned with it .85 dollars it was a waste . We will never be trying this place again .<//Review>

We always give this restaurant a chance. Our first bad experience here was when we asked for a take out box because we over ordered and there were a lot of left overs, but the waiter threw them out. They gave us a slice of cake for the trouble. 😖😖😖

Second bad experience was when we ordered steak and got a meat that's tough as leather...
We vowed to never come back. I don't know why we did the third time.🤔🤔🤔

We arrived for dinner, thinking maybe the place improved. We were given a table behind the reception. We waited for about 15 minutes. That is way too long not even a soul came to ask us for drinks... I was wondering why when there weren't a lot of people inside the restaurant on a Sunday night. My husband and I said that's enough, we're not coming back ever.</Review>

It was a disappointing experience. We came Sunday evening. It was not busy at all. We were a party of three. The person in the front led us to a table only two setup. She did not add one more. So I asked the server to give me a set.   After we finished the bread, I asked again. It was not particular busy. I would say the service is lack of attention. Ok the food: soup is lukewarm, salty. We ordered the signatures mac'n cheese. After 5 minutes, they said they ran out of mac and need to change to use rigatoni, fine. Three dishes came. The rigantoni was not hot enough even it was in a skillet. I ordered a side dish of fries. It did not come. I need to ask the server and it came finally after we almost finished the main dish. But at least it is hot!  Well I have been to at least two other Macaroni Grill  Either have no problem in service or food was not bad in my memory. This time, the food and service was quite disappointing. I wish I did not go. There is s Chilli right next to it. They do have better busy for "some" reasons</Text>

Horrible service, and the food was even worse. My steak was as salty as the Pacific and as tough as a shoe. They also said they "didn't have the ingredients" to make a drink they had on the menu but when I looked at the bar, they were fully stocked with said ingredients.<//text>

I’m here on Valentines Day and I have to say the service was terrible, long waits which I was expecting considering it is Valentines Day but all that followed, I really don’t think I’ll ever come back! The waiter forgot my wine, the appetizer I ordered was wrong and we waited 3 hours and no acknowledgment or a proper apology or approach.  We had to ask repeatedly for our water, t seemed we were a forgotten customer! Not good not good at all two thumbs down< /text>

The people are friendly., supposed to be a upscale family restaurant, but they use tap water high in chlorine content for their fountain drink machine. I could also taste the chlorine in the pasta that got boiled in it. I suggest they invest in a kangen water machine to cook with and a reverse osmosis for the fountain machine. Most likely, I will not return.<//text>

Very DISAPPOINTED . They placed my family and I in a short kid table with generic folded chairs. The chairs were very UNCOMFORTABLE. Our backs hurtl. We mentioned this to the manner. He did not cared.
The wine was served in a small glass like a kid glass, instead of wine glass. What happened to wine glass?
The food has a queen taste. My dish was shrimp scampi with angle hair noodles. However there was hardly noodles any in my dish.
Pricey food not worth it at all.
NEVER  will go back again.😤☹</Text>

Really friendly, quick service, good parking, and a nice atmosphere. My 7 and 10 year boys and myself are vegetarian and this is one of our favorite restaurants. I love the Ratatouille over crispy bricks of polenta (under 600 calories and some serious comfort food). My carnivorous husband loves it here too!<//Review>

Went here on Christmas Day and was extremely disappointed. My build your own pasta had an overwhelming amount of penne, and not nearly as much shrimp, grilled mozzarella or vegetables. So, I complained to the manager. He even admitted it didn’t look like it should and he noticed before the entree was brought to the table. Still, he allowed it to be served. He said he would speak with the kitchen. He didn’t offer to remake it or compensate in any way. The server was nice, so she gets the one star. She did offer to send it back to the kitchen, but I’m not a fan of sending food back to the kitchen for fear what may be added to the entree.  I also didn’t feel like waiting any longer, it took long enough to receive the entree. I will not return any time soon.</Text>

We came expecting the REALLY good experience we had several years ago. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Our server told us he was going to bring our balsamic vinegar and disappeared. I had to go search it out from another server. When he finally came with the vinegar, he also had two drinks for another table. Then we asked for more bread and again he disappeared. When a third server brought our food, we asked him for the bread. Our original server never returned except to bring our bill. The bread was not as we recalled either. We won't be back. This was the one in Corona.< /Review>

<review>I felt like it was worth what they were charging, it felt like Olive garden but pricier.
Also mixed checks up, which didn't look good.

< review>
This lunch special was more than enough at a great price. The chips and salsa are excellent and freshly prepared. The service is good but it could be improved since some customers seem to get more attention than others as far as checking on refills, if the food is good, etc. I will definitely continue to go.< /review>

The booth seats need replacing. The springs had fallen and our guest kept sliding backwards. It was humorous bc we are silly but on any other day, in a packed restaurant it would have been a big inconvenience. Also. In between the plates given to us for bread. Someone wrote a note and stick it in between the plates. Either It was a disgruntled dishwasher employee or the staff. Either way not cool! The food tasted good. That is the only reason this location got 2 stars.<//Text>

Dinner is why you go to this place.  Avoid the Sunday Brunch and stick with the tried and true menu that has sustained this chain restaurant.  I provided feedback with the staff and the corporate website.  nada.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>The worst service I have ever experienced.
We came with  my family  to the one in Corona. I called them 30 mins prior to reserve a table, when we came in it wasn’t ready, but they got it fixed fast. After we set, we started with drinks: water and sodas, we got them 40 mins after. Then 15 mins after that they brought the bread. So imagine to be an hour in the EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT and they didn’t even placed our order yet!
When we walked in, the place was nearly dead, only 2-3 tables were occupied on Friday night. At first we thought it was weird, but now we know why! I am pretty sure nobody comes back after the first visit!!!
So, we finally ordered our food after being there for an hour. 40 mins after that, they brought like a garden salad, then they let us know, some of the dish we ordered was not available, then the other 20 mins a soup showed up, and they informed there is no salmon, but they can get any other fish, after waiting for mahi mahi 20 mins, they came and said there is no fish at all.
We also got steaks, they brought them COLD, potatoes on the side were FROZEN!!!! We were really disappointed, but asked them to at least warm it up, they bring the steaks back after 10-15 mins, nothing was fixed, they were the same cold as before!!!
So we spend there more than 2,5 hrs, we were really patient and tried to understand the situation but it all was horrible!!! And obviously manager wasn’t even there.
They should definitely improve so many things!
I am really disappointed!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1559944004745, 'text': 'Thank you for your honest feedback on your recent visit to Macaroni Grill.

My family and I came here for a bday dinner. Everyone seem to enjoy their meals but my mushroom ravioli with wine sauce tasted like alcohol. Unfortunately for me they didn't burn off the alcohol. If I could describe it to something it seemed like someone poured a glass of wine and served it to me. Not exaggerating. It was unedible.</Text>

She was noticeably nicer to the people in the tables around us.  Seemed to be racially motivated. It was not busy in there at all either. We are not difficult people, we are good tippers, but it was too much even for us. Im very disappointed because it was my birthday and she made it uncomfortable with her dry demeanor and her obvious bias. I dont want to say her name because I wouldn't want to jeopardize someone's job.  We will not be going back for a long time if at all.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Rude , disgusting, overpriced, mediocre food at best. It was seriously one of the worst and scariest restaurant experiences I've had in years it made me question where I live. The tables are nasty the seats are ripped and weathered. The staff is really rude and unorganized. Clearly a lack of management or pride in ownership. I would recommend this place to somebody I do not like</Review>

Terrible service left me waiting over an hour for delivery and never even got my food!? When I called after asking them if they had even prepared my food the answer was no. Then they told me my order was cancled ? terrible service! They didn’t even offer to replace my order! Absolutely the worst and whoever I spoke to on the phone was no help at all<//text>

The service was poor and food was served at several different intervals with a long time in between.  The food was not prepared properly.
I would not recommend this particular resteraunt to anyone.< /Review>

Food is okay. They don't seem to know how to make a pizza very well.  They need a bubble popper.  My pizza had bubbles which, when they rose, caused all of my toppings including the cheese to settle in the center of the pizza and to one side.  The result was that only one slice had all of the toppings on it and yet no-one caught this and corrected it before serving.  The waitress took 5.00 off of the bill.</review>

<Review>December 25th 2017.
You can't make this up.

I wanted to take my family and friends to have a  nice dinner for Christmas but it really was a horrible experience.
First I was told 15 minutes at 1 hr and 5 minutes later finally we were seated
But guess what the waiting was far from over.  We ordered after  sitting a short while. We ordered fettuccine Alfredo. 1 plate with chicken and shrimp 2 plates with broccoli.
Well after a while they came back and said they were out of fettuccine noodle and suggested angel hair noodles we said ok that's fine. Next we waited and waited and the waitress came and took my wife's coffee cup to fill it up  at this thinking my food has got to coming soon we waited some more. During this time the waitress had come back to the table to tell us our food was coming in had to tell her that it has been 20 minutes since she took the coffee cup to refill it and we're told that the  coffee maker was broke but was now fixed. 10 minutes later my wife had coffee. The waitress ask me if I would like a refill of my drink I had to tell her that at this point I just want my dinner she said it's coming up. Now finally after now 2 hrs. And 20 minutes I got my plate and was told that they ran out of chicken and now I am sitting here with spaghetti noodles and shrimp.
We eat quickly because we are really hungry and then the bill comes and I ask to speak to the manager and I tell her that this is by far the worst experience that I have ever had. And what makes it worse is they act as if they don't  care. I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody.</Review><rating>1<//rating>< pics>

< review>
The food was below average  and over priced, not much of selection that appealed to us.  The service was okay.  We were placed near where the kiosk where the waitresses place orders, overhearing ALL gossip  made to each other.    We are not likely to return.<//review>

Everything was awful, the food tasted like they just popped in the microwave, even though I waited 2 and a half hours to get it... The service was horrible!!! If there was a 0 star option I would do that...</Text>

On the other hand, the food was not so good. The bread had a good flavor but it was overwhelmingly salty. I ordered the butternut tortellacci. Honestly, with a small fraction of the salt this would probably be pretty good. It has prosciutto in it, which is already salty, so it really wasn't necessary to load it up. It totally smothered the flavor of everything else and left me with that heavy, bloated, sodium overload feeling like I just ate at Macdonald's.

My husband ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo. It's hard to mess that up. The pasta was alright, but the chicken was both sparse and extremely poor in quality. He regretted eating it and didn't feel well afterward. So about $4 to add that gross chicken to a $13 plate of plain pasta. Not a huge plate.

So the environment was nice, and the staff, but the food was not worth it even at a cheaper price. We decided not to return before we were even out the door. Now I understand why the place was not too busy on a Saturday evening. Our loss.< /Review><Rate>3< /Rate>< user_name>

My pasta was a bit undercooked and stuck together. Then as I am still eating our servor brings my bill to the table saying I had asked for it, which I hadn't, with someone else's debit card inside the bill. Sad for this experience since we chose to eat here after not having a meal out in weeks.

Brunch was good, quantity of bacon given was skimpy.   My complaint is that the women's restroom was filthy and out of seat protectors.  I was there at 11 am and it was obviously not cleaned from the night before.  I am very concerned that if the restroom is not cleaned what about their kitchen.</text>

<Text>I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Problem is that they didn't have any meatballs so they gave me pasta with maybe spaghetti sauce (too watery to tell). Of course they charged me the full price of spaghetti and meatballs. An Italian place that doesn't have meatballs is like going to a burger place and they have no meat patties.< /Text>< userid>

I drive UberEats regularly and pickup from this Macaroni Grill pretty often. It always has alot of customers inside, but my wait for the takeout has always been just a couple of minutes until last nite. Took about 20 minutes as they were slammed. There was another UberEats driver in addition to the other delivery service drivers there, HubGrub & ? and there were also 4 customers that called in their orders for carry out.  The staff moved things along as quickly as they could to get each of us taken care of and on our way throwing in an extra something here and there or reducing the prices slightly to make up for the wait. It wasn't necessary as anyone that has ever eaten here should be aware that a busy restaurant means some amount of wait time due to the quality of food. The woman handling the orders (Yvonne) kept her composure as did the Manager (Can't remember his name). He gave me 2 different plates, a Chicken Alfredo and Lasagne for my wait. As I  said. they do see me as I said, quite often and maybe this was the reason. Both were very tasty and it was a nice gesture on his part. Now having tasted their food, I understand why the place always has alot of customers every time I'm sent there to pick up an order and I'll be taking my wife out to dinner here having sampled a very small portion of their menu. Tasty & Much appreciated.< /Text>

One of the few remaining Macaroni Grills. The inexpensive lunches are not good. You would be better off with the regular lunch items.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>We arrived and we're seated promptly. After ten minutes, we asked if we could get drinks and if our server was assigned to our table yet. We were brought drinks by a second server who told us that our waiter was coming shortly. We were told our server's name was ****. Bread was brought after we requested it twice. It was brought by another server. I requested a  build your own pasta sheet, and **** walked away after saying, "Yeah." Approximately ten more minutes passed, and **** returned. He asked to take our order, and I reminded him I had asked for a build your own pasta sheet.  He said, "Oh, yeah. Hold on." He came back with the sheet and we ordered. We also asked for drink refills. Included in what we ordered were two tomato soups. After fifteen minutes, our entrees came. It was brought by different servers. I inquired about our soups. The female server said she would check. She came back a few minutes later with the rest of our main dishes. She asked if we needed anything else. I asked for our tomato soups. She said she would check with ****, our server. He came by our table to offer cheese. I asked for our tomato soups. He left and returned with one soup. I looked at it, and asked, "Is that tomato soup?" He said, "No. It looks like minestrone." He returned to the kitchen and brought back another bowl of soup. This time it was tomato. I reminded him again how we had ordered two soups, but to please take the second soup off the check. When I took the first spoonful of soup, it was cold. I ate my main dish, and we asked for refills again on our drinks. **** returned and we asked for to-go containers and the check. He said, "OK" and walked away. He returned with the containers and the check, set them on the table and walked away. I asked another server to speak to the manager. I NEVER complain to a manager at restaurants.  I know food service is a difficult job. **** came back over and picked up two of our empty plates, and said, "Yeah, the manager will be over in a second." He walked away without taking any of the other plates. The manager came over and I told him I never complain at restaurants, but the service was terrible. He was apologetic and took the check to take some items off. I was facing where the wait staff works to input items into the system and print up the checks, and watched our server **** throw a wadded up piece of napkin or paper over the manager's shoulder while he smirked and shook his head. The manager,  brought the check back. I told him his server was the rudest server I had ever experienced. The manager again apologized and said he would address it.

I understand the manager addressed the issue, but this was terrible. The worst I have ever experienced.

Please never ever go to Romano Macaroni grill.<//review>< pics>

The Macaroni Grill on Grand Oaks, Corona Ca has the WORST customer service ever. Unfortunately for us, we gave them a second chance and went there tonight. Big mistake.

My family and I (2 adults, 2 kids) were seated in the bar area, not our choice. We arrived at 7PM and waited 25 minutes, not too bad. The restaurant was extremely busy for a Friday night, first week in November.

We waited several minutes for someone to take our drink/appetizer order. Appetizers came out quick, but no silverware to eat with. By the time we got silverware, the appetizers were cold.

Eventually the bartender (cause he was the only one handling the entire bar and tables within) came to take our order, and immediately realized we never got our drinks. He took our order and returned with our drinks.

Once the food was delivered, our table was never visited again except to drop off the bill. No drink refills, no parmesan cheese to top our entre's, nothing. My wife had to visit the hostess counter on two different occasions to inquire about drink refills and bread.

There appeared to be two managers on staff tonight. We tried to get their attention as they passed by our table, (walking together deep in a conversation) it was as if what they were talking about was much more important than a paying customer who's bill was north of $80 for 4 people.

Ideally we would like our money back, but it's our fault for not leaving during the drink/appetizer debacle.

The irony is, out of all the other restaurants we frequent in (or near) the Corona Crossings Shopping center, (Kings Fish House, Wood Ranch, Miguels, Chilis, BJ's Pizza...etc), they all seem to handle a busy crowd, but for some odd reason, Macaroni Grill fails every time.

We wont be back. (Unless they read this and comp our meal, we did save our receipt)<//review>

We can sum it up 3 words, OVERPRICED AND UNDERWHELMING. I had the Carmena Chicken with a house salad, ok so what they should have put in the description is" a bowl full of greasy sauceless rigatoni that a heavy dose of salt and parmesan could not fix. Hubby had the 3 course dinner with the mac and cheese bites, pork shank and chocolate cake which translates into 4 squares of flavorless noodles deep fried with some tasteless sauce which we could not figure out what the flavor was supposed to be, a pan of overcooked potatoes, some carrots for color and a hunk of bone with some meat on the outside oh and the marsala sauce that tasted like it came out of a healthy choice box, now lets not forget the dessert that said chocolate cake but looked more like a flat cupcake with some stuff on it that tasted like oil and sugar frosting. The ultimate bellini drink was not named properly as it was more like syrup under a slushi and the always hot out of the oven bread which the waitress forgot to bring until we asked for it was just salty coated bread with olive oil that was turning sour. Overall definitely not worth the 80 dollar total with tip and when the manager in the prince purple shirt asked how was everything and we said OK you would think he would inquire as to what could have made it better but no he just walked away. Good luck to those who go there after reading this, you will need it.</Review>

<review>It was OK, not too impressed with the quality of the plate. Thought the Alfredo sauce was from yesterday and just microwaved. The chicken parm was dry. Not a good visit. It will be sometime before we return.<//review><Date>1502942042774<//Date><pics>None<//pics>< resp>
