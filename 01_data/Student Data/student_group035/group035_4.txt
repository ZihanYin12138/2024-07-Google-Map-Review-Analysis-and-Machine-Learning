<Text>It all comes down to who got money. Our community is being demoted by this services who's more concerned on their personal interest. I've been robbed 5 times this year and my neighbors too. All they say is " we got bigger problems " . Now how do I deal with this, cops don't help and my neighborhood being a target for robbers. I'm not upset or angry but troubled. We got families here and we all pay taxes for what reason?< /Text>< Gmap_id>

You do not at all do what your motto says "To proctect and serve"  Instead you let a creeper run loose in your city and streets. Taking people hostage and hurting them. Shame on you El Monte PD.  Your dispatchers are a joke to no help and all they do is stuff their faces with food and donuts.</Text>

Their good "manners" seems like a facade, I was ushered and hushed multiple times while explaining the problem that I needed help with and they just kept on jumping in and finishing my sentences for me... It was like they didn't really care and just wanted me to leave them alone.< /Text>

I would like to express my heartfelt thank you and commend officier erique and his partner for retrieving my stolen phone today. They were extremely professional and efficient. iPhone’s “Lost Mode” definitely was a plus.

I would like to share my story this all happened a few hours ago in Elmonte major street Gravey dated 4/2/18. I got pulled over by 6 cop cars all tactical formation had their semi automatics guns pointed at my vehicle. At that moment I felt the world for me has come to end scared coz any slit mistake I do put my hand down would be shot at.  I did all they asked me to do handcuffed put me in the back of their cruiser. Reason they kept saying someone has been reported to have guns in the area so gave them go head to search my vehicle found NOTHING. They got me out their cruiser sat at the curb side told them reason why I was in that area to see my girlfriend. All in that at the moment alot is circling in my mind if nothing is found why can't they let me go, is it the car that I'm driving or what is an African American doing in this particular area. Here is what I don't understand at the curb side I was told stand face one of their vehicles with flash light "on their radio didn't match description who they were looking for coz they used a code." They put back in vehicle again to search in the data base if I had any pending arrest warrants. Nothing was was on my record for 25min stand off  I believe the minute they sensed didn't have any wopeans they should have immidately let me go and go with their search.I respect police officers in what they do for communites after this whole incident I felt in certain type of way but it's the world we live in..<//review>

Now I'm left with a totaled car because of these stupid officers that did not want to arrest the woman that crashed my car and left the scene. I Pay taxes  and therefore I should feel save in my own city and have hope that they could keep me save but now I know that am not save they don't know how to do their job. I guess is up to me to do the investigation.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Being 29 weeks pregnant is the worse way to get stop by cops. Me personally i was just sitting on the curve on my phone. I just saw my bf and his friend being search by the cops so i stood up to see what was going on and sure enough a undercover shows up and starts yelling at me. I just couldn't process what was happening so i sat on the curve like he said at that moment more cops showed up i just let them know i was pregnant. Thanks to those 2 officers for treating me nice and calming me down because i was getting emotional but to that "undercover cop" he needs to calm down i felt like he took his power way to far while the other cops stood their ground but treated us professional still. They did arrest my bf but they said he'll be out in like 3 hours so they told me i didn't have to follow him to the station. The only thing is they said they will call me when my bf was out but they never did i found him walking as i was driving. Why did they get my Name, Address, and phone # for if they weren't even gonna bother to let me know when he was out. Nonsense.<//Review>

<review>The review is for the POS that answered my call.  Condescending jerk was putting words in my mouth and yelling when the idiot kept interrupting me and asking me questions.  HOW THE HELL CAN I ANSWER if you keep interrupting me?  Very disrespectful and questioning my judgment as a parent.  I hope he's only a dispatcher because I would hate for someone to have to deal with such a POS who takes his position and manipulates it. This idiot talking about X-ray vision!  The stupidity of his words and disrespectful ways is was makes people so angry with police.  However the actual police officer I spoke to was helpful and I appreciate the effort they provided in helping with my situation.  That was all I was asking for.</review>< Rating>

The police are always good when we need their help. I'm leaving one star because I called today about a drunk man making nasty sexual comments to myself and a couple employees and the women customers making everyone extremely uncomfortable. He was very unstable and extremely rude sitting with a giant bottle of tequila and when I called they ask if it was an emergency and it wasn't yet but that's why I called the police department number and not 911... my boss had me hang up and call the other number we had and the dispatcher yelled at me for hanging up and saying that they were dealing with more important things then what I was dealing with right now.. then proceeded to tell me there is a gun men and what we had wasn't important... I get it but she was extremely rude and yelled at me. I think the situation could have been handled way more professionally and just told me that they would send someone when they handle a situation before ours because I'm also at work and don't need to be waiting on the phone when they could send someone when they had more time. I'm extremely upset about how the whole thing was handled very unprofessional.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I went to the Police Station to denounce a disabled person who is cheating women from the immigrant community. He offers us work, mistreats us and does not pay us, when we demand payment he does not say he will send the migra, police, or he will take you out his weapon, I was terrified, I was terrified, but I went but both in El Monte and in Temple city they did not listen to me.
He lives at 2717 Dequine Ave.
Rosemead CA, 91770
He puts letter-size leaves on the corner of this street in winichzer restaurant. Please, if you see them ignore them, Carlos, Miguel, your alias is a scammer and I was his victim, pass this information so that he does not deceive more people.

Yo 😭acudí a la Estación de Policía para denunciar a un discapacitado que está engañando a mujeres de la comunidad inmigrante😭nos ofrece trabajo, maltrata y no nos paga, cuando exigimos el pago no dice mandará a la migra, policía, o que te sacará su arma, tenía terror, mucho terror, pero fui pero tanto en El Monte como en Temple city no me hicieron caso.
El vive en 2717 Dequine Ave.
Rosemead CA, 91770
El pone hojas tamaño carta en la esquina de esta calle en restaurante winichzer por favor si los ven ignorenlos, Carlos, Miguel, sus alias es un estafador y fui su víctima, pasen esta información para que no engañe a más personas.<//Text>

Dr. Cole did an amazing job fixing my tooth to make the filling look like one natural tooth! I was so excited I took photos to send to my friends (and now will share with internet strangers)! Her assistant Heather was also incredible.
Dr. Cole is also incredibly gentle and I did not feel a thing. If anyone is nervous about pain, needles, or the dentist in general, she is the dentist you need to see! Thank you Dr. Cole!!!</review>< pictures>

Good service with quality and care. I had two crowns in one visit and  I don’t feel anything uncomfortable. In addition to the almost perfect job, they also follow up double check the status which I feel being taken care of and safe.<//Text>

<text>Dr. Chase was incredible!!!! 5 stars for him and 5 stars for Dr. Hada and his entire team. They were super friendly and thoughtful. My dental Assistant Chris was always looking to make me more comfortable. Dr. Chase squeezed me in to his busy schedule because I had a broken filling and he wanted to make sure it was addressed quickly. This was my first time using Dr. Chase. In the past I had problems staying numb. I told him this and he assured me I wouldn’t feel anything. His goal was my well-being—always making sure I wasn’t in pain and going above and beyond to do-so. I was at peace the entire time, and they even have Netflix to watch and listen to during the procedure.</text>< Pictures>

BEST DENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER! Today I had my first phase appointment for veneers. Dr Hada and his assistants Anna and April made sure my experience was comfortable the entire time. I never felt the shot either!! My temporaries look and feel AMAZING. If you want an exceptional dental experience or are afraid of the dentist, you must go to Hada Family Dental. If you want a beautiful smile, go to Hada Family Dental.</Text>

Dr. Carlston is currently doing my ortho treatment and I couldn’t be happier!! My teeth are moving faster than I anticipated and I’m seeing amazing results just 15 weeks in. He’s been there every step of the way and checks in frequently to see how it’s going which I appreciate. I’ve never felt so comfortable in a dental office before. He’s the best!< /text>

<Review>Absolutely impressed with Hada Family Dental and Kelley!!! Wonderful experience from the start. Took my 3 year old daughter for her very first dentist visit and Kelley couldn't have been more perfect! She made my daughter feel comfortable and happy right away and had zero issues hopping on the chair to get her teeth cleaned and first check up! Kelley explained everything in a very toddler friendly way! So please by the office environment as well. Very clean and front desk assistants were excellent! Looking forward to.cpming back in a couple of weeks for my first visit!</Review>< response>

The office is very clean and welcoming. Also, I was able to watch Netflix while getting my teeth cleaned!! I felt so relaxed and refreshed after Cori cleaned my teeth. I would definitely recommend and will definitely be coming back. Thanks Cori! :)< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>We love Hada Family Dental! We’ve been going there for 7+ years now. I love the new office. It’s beautiful! The location is also great. There is a flat courtyard outside where my kids can ride scooters while waiting, plus a Starbucks next door for me. My kids love the TV and headphones while getting worked on. They love the prize bin at the end even more. Dr. Hada  is the nicest and most trustworthy person you will ever meet, plus you can tell he’s dedicated to his work. We always feel important and cared for by all the staff. Our favorite hygienist is Cori. She has a beautiful smile that will motivate you to floss more and is great with kids.< /text><Resp>None</Resp><name>Joy Lee</name></record></dataset><record>

The atmosphere is peaceful and the dental hygienist and dentists are friendly, comforting, and encouraging.  I was completely comfortable my entire visit.  The front office was hospitable and efficient.  I could not be more thankful for the entire experience!</Review>

The BEST Dentist experience.  I've visited many dental offices growing up in the past but by far the staff at Dr. Hada's office has been truly amazing.  Carol and Tori go above and beyond to make sure you feel cared for and make you feel like your apart of their family.  I can't say more about how great they are and how much I enjoy seeing Dr. Hada.  If you're a new patient and never had a positive experience at a dentist, you will 100% here!<//text>

<Review>Was referred to Hada Family Dental by friends when I broke a molar (never mooch the last handful of popcorn, you'll surely pay)...
Dr Cole and Sarah took amazing care of me. Highly professional, yet warm and kind enough to ease the anxiety of a genuine dental-chicken like me. From the front office staff through all the clinicians, this practice is top notch. I'm an operating room RN locally, so cleanliness and technique are paramount to me. Hada Family Dental has a spotless office and treatment areas, and I am very impressed by the quality of the patient care they deliver. I cannot recommend them highly enough. ..Thanks for taking such great care of me.< /Review>< name>

Had the most wonderful dental experience I've ever had with Dr Carlston. Zero painful moments and was so helpful in my dental care options designed for me. The Hada Family dental facility and staff will actually make you excited for your next appointment!<//review>

Been looking for a dentist I could trust. Was recommended Hada Family Dental with Dr. Chase Carlston. I have had a new patient exam, two cleanings and had three teeth worked on. I have brought my kids and wife to Dr. Carlston because my experience has been hands down the best dental experience I have ever had.

If you are looking  for a place for your kids this is the guy.

If you are looking for someone for your wife because she might be embarrassed, this is the man.

If you need someone who knows what they are doing and want someone you trust. I have one person I would recommend. Dr. Chase Carlson and his v whole staff of amazing, nice, helpful, and friendly.

I love the text reminder of appointments and the affordable pricing.< /text>

I do not like going to the dentist, and have avoided it for some time. I recently went to @hadafamilydental in Mission Viejo and had an amazing experience. Not only was the office clean and organized, everyone was super nice and helpful. I unfortunately had some cavities after so long away but they all made the experience as easy as possible. Cori Salazar was my dental hygienist and did an incredible job. She was patient, and kind as she educated me on how to create better habits at home. I could not recommend a better dental hygienist or dentist!</Text>

Love love love Hada Family Dental! Each of the staff members greets you with a smile, from front to back office. The office is clean, modern, and beautifully decorated.

My hygienist, Kelley, is so sweet and funny and cleans my teeth so well. As a hygienist myself, I can attest to what a good, thorough, yet comfortable cleaning is, and she is the absolute best. No one else cleans my teeth!<//review>

<text>After avoiding the dentist for roughly 3 years Hada Family Dental welcomed me with open arms. It was my first experience with them and I ended up having to return multiple times. Dr. Cole was very informative and ensured that I knew what was happening every step of the process. Lizzie, her assistant was an absolute DOLL and was so sweet. She remembered me when I returned for a visit and I was so impressed with her continuously sunny disposition. Dental work is never fun, but since hygiene is important I can't recommend Hada Dental enough.</text></record>

<Review>My Hada Family Dental experience is always great. Their staff are professional yet down to earth and super nice. Especially, Amber, she is by far the absolute best dental assistant I have ever come across. She explains everything clearly and makes sure you understand the next step, she has a beautiful personality and is easy on the eyes if you know what I mean. Dr. Cole and Amber make a great team. I highly recommend Hada Family Dental!</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1495752577434, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time and leaving your positive feedback.

I love these people! Their positive energy radiates throughout the office. Besides their energy, the doctors and dental assistants are up to date on the latest techniques and use the latest technology to treat their patients. I felt like I was treated with so much respect and professionalism. I had some treatment planned and they were so understanding. This is the most important take away. They never push for the most profitable treatment. They really understand that you are a patient, not just a customer and plan your treatment accordingly.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Hada is very skilled and extremely talented when it comes to making your teeth look and feel good. I knocked my teeth out snowboarding, and got composite veneers by another dentist 15 years ago. While they held up as good as they could, I decided I needed to get my teeth fixed. I've lived in 8 different states  and I had previously had a consultation with at a well known cosmetic dentist in Utah, as well as other dentists in other states. I was referred to Dr Hada by my friend after seeing her flawless smile, and I decided to get a flight from Utah to California to get a consultation with Dr. Hada. Not only is Dr Hada very personable but he has an attention to detail and knows what will look good and how to achieve it. I decided to fly back down to California and get my teeth fixed! Dr Hada was the one I felt would do the best job and he did. I Needed 2 crowns and 4 veneers on my front top teeth. I am extremely pleased with the results! I'm also extremely picky, so I drag my feet making decisions but hands down I would recommend Hada Family Dental to anyone and everyone! In or out of state. Plus the procedure was nearly painless. Dr. Hada and his staff especially Amanda who was his assistant during my appointment were very good about making sure I was comfortable. He's very particular about making sure the color is correct, the shape, and your bite lining up. As well as making sure your other teeth and gums stay healthy.  I was nervous but looking back realizing I probably should not have been nervous. I just can't say enough good things about this dental practice! I believe my before and after photos might be on the website soon. He will also go out of his way to check on you if you had any major dental work. He works with kids and is great with them. He truly has passion in what he does! His dental assistants are so kind. I will continue to fly down to California to use Hada Family Dental for our dental needs! Thank you guys so much!!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I love Hada dental!  The staff is so friendly. Dr. Hada is friendly, knowledgeable, and honest. He let me know of any issues, and what I need to do to prevent things from getting worse. Kelley is such a wonderful hygienist. She is friendly, and efficient. I overloaded her with questions, and she had answers and advice to help me with my teeth sensitivity among other things. I will look no further for a dentist or hygienist.< /text>

Every time I come here the staff is amazing. Really friendly and genuinely care about how you are and what's going on in your life. Going to the dentist isn't necessarily a "fun" experience but Dr. Hada and his staff make it the best experience it can be. All the assistants, especially Amanda, are great. I needed a lot of work done in the back of my teeth, from crowns to fillings, and they made it seem easy and  smooth. Dr. Hada knows what he is doing and knows how to treat his patients. Not to mention my teeth feel 100 times better. I look forward to getting my teeth to be amazing with Dr. Hada and Hada Family Dental.</text>

I recently had my teeth cleaned by Kelley, my dental hygienist, and had an amazing experience! She is so gentle and caring. I also had work done by Dr. Cole who did an outstanding job and gave me the best treatment. Amber, her dental assistant, is so sweet and thorough with her explanations. My experience there was 5 stars to say the least! Dr. Hada, I felt the great energy of your office staff and will surely recommend it to all of my family and friends!< /text>

Dr. Hada and his staff always provide a great dental experience (if there is such a thing!).  His staff are extremely friendly and always try to accommodate special circumstances and requests.  Dr. Hada takes the time to clearly explain what is going on and what he thinks the best treatment will be.  Best thing is, you feel like you are getting the straight story from him - that he cars about your dental health and that he is only suggesting care that will make you feel better. Trust is super important (I have to admit I have had a few questions with other dentists I have seen) and I have always felt secure that he is concerned first and foremost on what is best for me.<//text>

I have been coming to Hada Family Dental since I was a child and have always had a great experience. I had a cleaning with Kelley and Katie today and they were great! Kelley made sure to explain and demonstrate why flossing was important and it finally made sense. Dr. Hada is always great- very personable and friendly and takes the time to get to know his patients. The office staff are always friendly as well. I highly recommend Hada Family Dental.< /text>

Everyone at Hada Family Dental was friendly and professional. The ladies at the front desk, our hygienist Julie, assistant Eber, and dentist Dr Cole were all super nice and took great care of my teeth.
I brought my 3 year old for his first visit and they made him feel right at home. He loved watching cartoons with the headphones and getting his bag of treats at the end. Julie was great about showing him the tools and counting his teeth. He can't wait to go back.< /text>

I absolutely love this office! My experience at Hada Family Dental has exceeded all expectations. Dr. Hada and Dr. Cole are amazing dentists who truly care about their patients. I recently had my teeth straightened by Dr. Hada with braces for my upcoming wedding and I am so thrilled with how straight and perfect they look! He was able to perfect my smile in such a short period of time and made sure to have them off just in time for my bridal shower!
Dr. Cole has done a few fillings on me which were completely painless procedures! She has also done some dental work on my mom, who has very high dental anxiety, and made her feel so comfortable the entire time. That was the first time I have ever seen my mom leave a dentist office smiling!
The assistants always go above and beyond to make you feel extremely comfortable and the front office staff make you feel like family when you walk in the door.
If you are in search of a great dentist office, Hada Family Dental will not disappoint!<//text>

<Review>Had a great experience here! I woke up constantly for multiple nights with a bad toothache! Like serious dizzying pain... I decided to go in to see Cori (my dental hygienist. Go see her, she’s amazing) to see if an old cavity was to blame.  I expected some long expensive procedure. To my amazement Dr Carlston said he would have me fixed in about 5 minutes!  Apparently the last dentist I had, didn’t level out a crown and when I chew it puts kore pressure on my gums where that crown is. A little fine sanding down later and I was all good!  I can’t believe I have had that issue for years!  So happy! Thank you Cori and thank you Dr Carlston.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

< review>
What an outstanding office!
Jill, (hygienist) is amazing!!
So gentle and professional, with a wonderful personality! Rita, (front desk) was a doll in helping us with our dental insurance.
Oh, and the office was was
beautiful, spotless and well organized!
And finally there’s Dr. Hada, without a doubt the very best! He was a joy of a Dr., and the greatest as a person. Really easy to connect with and gave us a very enjoyable dental experience. Dr. Hada has very professional dental ethics and caring towards our dental health. He pointed out some concerns, that needed to be watchful of. Not once did he push or rushed anything that didn’t need to be done. Dentistry can be so foreign and confusing, especially if you don’t know what really is true. Not to mention terrifying.
From the moment I walked in till the very last goodbye, my husband and I were treated so wonderful!
I’m so happy to have found the perfect dental office!
Thanks everyone at Hada Family Dental!
See you soon.<//review>

<user_id>100185427566974830291< /user_id><text>I needed an urgent appointment to get begin my treatment before May 14. The front desk staff, Rita and team, are very cordial and did everything necessary to fit me in and secured a May 11 early morning appointment with Dr Cole. Dr Cole was phenomenal. She made sure that everything is done with utmost care and close to perfection. Sarah, the assistant,has just the right touch. She made sure also that the impressions and temporary crowns done were perfectly! Sarah has just the perfect touch and i told her she would be a very good dentist herself.  My entire family have been going to Hada Dentistry since we moved to the area in late 2013. Our experience has been great ever since.  The funny part was with Dr Hada and my husband. My husband told me that he fell asleep - literally probably close to snoring - while Dr Hada was working on his teeth. That's how much we trust these folks.< /text><Response>None<//Response>< time>

My Dentist Dr Cole was amazing, I have always been a little afraid to go to the Dentist and she went out of way to make me feel comfortable. She and her assistant Amber  are amazing, they don't make you feel like your a number but they go out of there way to let you know they see you as a person. The thing I loved the most is that Dr Cole and Amber explained everything they were doing step by step because they knew I was scared. I will be returning and feel very comfortable doing so. Thanks Dr Cole and Amber You guys are the best and make a great team.</review>

I am currently 5 months pregnant and was extremely worried about a dentist still pushing X-rays so was very careful in where I chose to go. After reading many, many reviews and asking for recommendations on the local Facebook group, Hada Family Dental was recommended and I decided to schedule. In addition to me being pregnant, I am also diagnosed with Hyperemesis gravidarum. HG is a pregnancy complication that is characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and possibly dehydration. Feeling faint may also occur so I was very worried about a simple teeth cleaning as I cannot even hold water down at this moment. Upon checking in, I threw up 3 times in the bathroom and was worried I might have to reschedule. The staff advised me that ironically, 5 of the staff are pregnant including my dental hygienist, Cori Salazar, RDH. It made me feel more comfortable regarding my care so I moved forward with the appointment and it was truly the best experience I could've had given my situation. I think I was a hard patient as my nausea was constant and I had to keep getting up to take a minute so I don't throw up, but Cori was absolutely nothing less than exemplary. She was so professional, so courteous and so understanding that I was in utter disbelief. She took her time cleaning my teeth and let me take as many breaks as possible, even if that meant keeping me after they close. She even offered to split the cleaning appointment into two if it was too much for me to handle at once. I have never received such amazing service as this in my life. Not to mention, I was provided with a business card to call at any time I needed to, even after hours, in case I had any concerns at all. Now that is service that I will keep coming back for. My husband and son will be coming in for an appointment soon and I am very confident that we will be lifetime clients of Hada Family Dental. Superb experience!</Review>

Tori and Brianne have both cleaned my teeth at this practice and they are excellent! Thorough, patient, and kind. Dr. Hada re-did an implant crown that I had completed over 12 years ago and I am thrilled with the results! This is a very kind dental office, they explain everything very well and you don't feel like a stranger when you come back through the door. Definitely recommend this office to people of all ages!!</Text>

I have been to a few dentists in the area after my long time dentist retired. I am so glad that I was referred to Dr. Hada from someone at my gym who heard me complaining about trying to find a good dentist. Not only did I find a good one, I am pretty sure that I have found the best. I can go into great detail on this. However, let me just say that these guys are on the forefront of technology and are super friendly. I actually love going to this office which I have NEVER said about any dentist. I really like Amber who is his assistant. She is so attentive to her patients needs. She is a great gal that is on top of her profession. She really works well in conjunction with supporting Dr. Hada to make sure that they deliver a great experience. Just like magic! Yes, I did just say that about a dentist office!? Go check them out. Just don't book them up too much! I still need to get in! : )</Text>

<Review>What a great experience! Carol greeted us so warmly as soon as we walked in the door. Julie took such care reassessing our young son who was told by another office that he needed an excessive amount of dental work. She and Dr. Hada agreed that was not the case. How refreshing to come to a practice and receive traditional, honest and friendly dental care instead of the aggressive "you need a ton of work" type.
Thank you!<//Review>< user>

I recently visited the office for the first time and the facility is beautiful, clean, and very well run. My hygienist Kelley was extremely gentle, but very thorough and my teeth have felt great since my visit. Kelley, as well as the rest of the staff, made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I will absolutely go back to Kelley and I am excited to make this my family office!</text>

The major self-induced side effects including persistent Mt. Dew rinses, Skoal Bandits, and shouting at those of a different skin-tone have done their toll on my mouth. After doing a genealogy report based on my DNA I learned my ancestors played a game called “who can inbreed the most” which also didn’t help how my teeth formed. Seriously. If there was reality TV back then they easily could have started a new show called Wife/Sister and lasted multiply seasons. The only royalty my family line has ever experienced are the 4 crowns I have in my mouth. Frankly, these teeth are a joke. If not for Dr. Cole at Hada Family Dental and her patience, skill and psychological prowess, I’m sure I’d be gumming my way through another bag of hot Cheetos or yelling at more Irishmen. She and her staff were confident in their ability to tackle this travesty of a mouth and I came out looking like a million bucks. I can’t fix the rest of the garbage dump that is my family, but at least Hada Family Dental could fix my teeth!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I was referred to Dr. Hada by a family member when I complained about having to get a root canal. I visited Dr. Hada and was impressed by his professionalism and his kindness. His staff got me in right away and were easy to work with. I went back in for the root canal being pretty nervous as anyone should be for this procedure. Hada took great care of me. The worst part for me is the numbing shot and he walked me through it and I didn't feel a thing. During the entire time I could tell he was making sure I was happy and comfortable. He did a quality job and I didn't have to spend my whole day there. Very impressed. Afterward he explained everything that he did and told me how to prevent it. His assistant took great care of me as well and I actually enjoyed going to the dentist. I definitely would refer anybody I talk to Hada Family Dental!

Love Hada Family Dental. Dr. Rich Hada is brilliant with mad dental skills.  Dr. Hada and Amber made my root canal a  totally pain free experience.  The entire Hada dental crew was impressive. Hard to find a good honest dentist these days. Hada family dental is legit.<//text>

This is the best dental office I have ever been to, without a doubt.  I went in for a simple cleaning and will definitely go back for any future dental needs.  The hygienist was incredibly gentle to the point that I almost didn't realize my teeth were being cleaned, but the before and after pictures I saw were amazing and showed how thorough of a cleaning I received!  Dr. Hada goes to great lengths to ensure everyone feels comfortable in his office, he even has TVs in each room so patients can watch the news or the game so they can relax.  This is the place I would take my family based upon the quality of work and the way Dr. Hada and his staff treat their patients.  You can bet I'll be back in 6 months for my next cleaning!<//text>

What a caring team, my whole family has been coming for years and we actually enjoy a visit to the dentist. They are conservative with my treatments and expenditures and often have recommended less expensive alternatives that make sense.  We are very lucky to have been recommended to them long ago.<//review>

Wow!!! What staff and awesome dentist! I was treated so well from the moment they called to confirm my appointment, to the time I walked through the front door, from the time I sat down to get my dental work and they even followed up with a phone call later that day to make sure I was doing well. It is so nice to have a dentist in our community who cares. Thank you Dr. Hada and team for a great experience.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Wow!! I am so grateful for Hada family dental. They really went above and beyond to take care of my daughter!!!

Our little girl came hole from school complaining of some pain near one of her bacK teeth. We inspected the area and noticed a small bump on her gum. We didn’t think much of it, until later when we were out at dinner. She stated to complain more and more and the pain became so unbearable that she could not eat. By this time, it was just past 7:00 pm and my wife and I were worried that we would have to wait until the morning to be seen by a dentist. I reached out to the team at Hada Family Dental who immediately informed us to come down to their office.

We were greeted by the front office staff who were prepared for our arrival. Dr. Hada had called his team and informed them that we were on our way into the office. We were immediately brought back and greeted by the dental assistant. She took some x-rays and went and got Dr. Carlston.

Dr. Carlston was amazing! He took the time to talk with our little girl and was so incredibly perfect with her. Our little girl was nervous that she was going to be in more pain. Dr. Carlston could tell by our little girl’s body language that she was nervous. He got down on her level and told her that if she felt anything, she could punch him in the arm. This simple little joke lightened her anxiety and made her much more comfortable. He was phenomenal.

The whole team at Hada Family Dental knew exactly what our little girl needed. They took the time and showed how much they cared. They even put some Chapstick on her little chapped lips to help her be more comfortable. I was so impressed that they stayed after hours to help our little girl get out of pain. I cannot say enough about Hada Family Dental and would highly recommend them to anyone needing dental services.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Dr. Hada is personal, professional and excellent at what he does. Our entire family loves going to the dentist because of him. Just last week our 5 year old needed two fillings and sat relaxed and comfortable while Dr. Hada took care of it.  We have all had great experiences and will continue going to him in the years to come.<//text>

<Date>1503514916892< /Date><Text>I have known Dr. Hada for almost 5 years. We have mutual patients and I have always heard great things about his practice and staff. I went for the first time to have some major work done this past month.  I had seven fillings redone and a crown placed. Dr. Hada is a perfectionist and was extremely thorough throughout the 3 visits I had with him to complete the work. He has a great personality, makes you feel comfortable and is a very honest person. It is really difficult to find a dentist who isn't a salesperson but genuinely cares about providing quality care in an ethical manner.

Julie, his dental hygienist, was very thorough, pleasant and did a great job on my cleaning. Dr. Hada's staff is very knowledgeable, well trained and very friendly. The office itself is very clean.

I highly recommend Dr. Hada!</Text></record>

Wonderfully staff. I hadn't been to this dentist in over a year but when I walked in they knew me by name! That put me at ease immediately.
The xray was easy and so was the time w the dentist.
I highly recommend this place they are great with kids from what I saw w the kids that were there.< /review>

Describe my experience? I don't know that I've ever felt less pain and more overall comfort at the dentist in my entire life. I have been told that I have pretty rock solid teeth, so a root canal seemed more scary than getting all 4 wisdom teeth out at the same time. Dr. Hada has a steady and skilled hand, and his ability to explain and carry out the procedure, gave me a comfort that I didn't know I could feel. I certainly enjoyed watching whatever I wanted during the whole process as well. If there was a sixth star, I would have given him another. Thanks Doc!<//Review>

For me: Dr. Cole and her team are awesome! Full disclosure, I am not the greatest patient, in fact I'm a wreck in the chair and Dr. Cole and her team have been supportive and patient. I chose to start seeing Dr. Cole after I took my son in for a dental emergency. Dr. Cole has made sitting in the chair manageable. All of the work I've had done is excellent. Julie is my hygienist and she is also patient and caring and I'm so grateful for her. Julie is a pro! Rita, Carol, and Lynne are the amazing front office staff. They are all very pleasant and are extremely knowledgeable about insurance billing.  I give Dr. Cole and her team the highest recommendation.
For my son: Dr. Cole was able to work with my son, who has heightened anxiety & other medical issues, during a dental emergency. She referred us to the best Endo and got the plan in motion to get him out of pain. Carol and Rita were able to provide coordination between three doctors! My son is now out of pain and he loves Dr. Cole.  He went from being terrified of the dentist to loving his dentist...highest recommendation.< /Review>

I was referred here by my friend Kelley and had a great experience at my first visit.  The staff were all very kind and helpful. Plus, my chair was ready for me at my appointment time (no wait!). Dr. Cole showed me my X-rays and gave me a thorough explanation of why treatment was needed.  She then explained to me the types of treatment options that were available, their pros and cons, and gave her recommendation. I felt confident trusting in her expertise, especially when she had taken the time to go over my options so I could make an informed decision. Having been to dentists that don't explain the problem and jump right into scheduling for treatment, this was a really pleasant experience.  Thank you Hada Family Dental!< /review>

I'm not a huge fan of the dentist, but this office always makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. Brianne is a great hygienist who makes me almost forget what I'm there for. I've seen both Dr Cole and Dr Hada and they are equally caring and personable. Love this office!< /Text>

I hated going to the dentist and would undoubtedly put it off as long as I could. That was until I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Hada and the talented staff there. Not only is the office pleasant, the staff from every aspect has made what was once a burden an enjoyable experience. Can not thank them enough for all they do.< /Review>

This was my first experience seeing Dr. Cole since I am a regular patient of Dr. Hada. Dr. Cole was very nice and easy to talk with about some issues which were being watched per my chart notes made by Dr. Hada. I needed to have a few fillings redone, and Dr. Cole amd Amber were able to fit me in later that day to return for the dental work. Speaking with Dr. Cole put me at ease like I was speaking with Dr. Hada - they are very similar and put you at ease with your concerns. I am so glad that my concerns were taken care of by Dr. Cole and Amber who were very gentle and spoke to me through the entire procedure. I recommend going to Dr. Cole and Dr. Hada since I have been a patient for at least 5 years to date.</review>< Pictures>

<review>I have been going to Hada Family Dental and seeing Dr. Hada and his amazing staff for the last few years. I needed a ton of work done in preparation for braces. In my life I have had surgeries, root canals, fillings, deep cleanings, you name it, I've had it done to my teeth and have had not so many great experiences in the past.

Dr. Hada came into my life and changed my entire perspective on the dental industry and experience. He is so thorough and detailed in his explanations without being medical so that I understand just what he is doing both before and after procedures. He is compassionate in his work and respects both mine and his time. He has gained my complete trust and I have recommended people to his practice as I would you. And might I add the most important part....I have never once felt any of the injections he has given, lol. Honest.<//review>< resp>

Such a great experience here. This practice is beautiful and the people are so kind. I was so nervous about my tooth problem because I felt like it was my fault and I would get shamed by the dentist, but I never once felt this way when I was with Dr. Cole. They got me out of pain fast and they came up with a plan that worked for my mouth and my budget. I highly recommend this practice.< /review>

Dr. Hada and his team are prolific and make every visit a great experience with their friendly, and impeccable service coupled with genuine enthusiasm. Dr. Hada will give you the thorough run through on the procedures that will be done during your appointment which then guides you to the whats, whys and wheres of the dental procedure. Again he and his team are the best at what they do.< /text>

You can tell that Dr. Hada loves what he does because he goes out of his way to help his patients. I have really bad TMJ and he helped me get a mouth guard. He let me come back as many times as I needed to adjust my mouth guard. Also, he is very honest. I have had other dentists tell me I needed work done when I really didn't. Dr. Hada has said that I can just keep an eye on things instead of jumping to do work. The rest of his team is awesome as well! Everyone is super friendly. I give this practice 5 stars!</Review>< userid>

This is my second review. Dr. Hada and his staff are amazing. Please see my other review. This review is for Dr. Cole and her assistant Sarah. I had a crown prep done today and the both of them were amazing. They worked very well together. I was blown away. You cannot go wrong here. Dr. Cole is amazing. Sarah is amazing.<//Review>

I had a great experience at the office today. The staff, and Dr. Hada were very welcoming. I had a portion of my lingual bar replaced, and everything feels back to normal. Throughout the procedure, they discussed the work they would do, prior to carrying it out. I feel he is a very knowledgable Doctor, and feel I would refer my close friends and family to his office.<//text>

I went in recently to have my semi-annual cleaning and was thoroughly pleased as I have been in the past.  All of the staff were warm and welcoming, competent and thorough.

We've recommended many friends and neighbors and they have all expressed their gratitude for the referral.< /Text>

The entire staff is so welcoming. Julie has been our hygienist for 20+ years! Dr. Hada is truly talented, always having the patient's best interest in mind. Going to the dentist is like spending time with family who have more than earned our trust.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Having moved around alot and not having inherited the best teeth, I've had a lot of experience with dentists over the years. It's not my favorite thing to go to the dentist. But Dr. Hada and his staff are so easy to work with. I don't wait too long and the dentistry is excellent. Dr. Hada is a warm, kind, detail-oriented dentist. He is the most gentle dentist I've ever been to. And I feel very confident about his skills. He has made a sub-par smile into a spectacular smile. He is honest and very skilled. What more could you ask for? I don't dread going to the dentist anymore!</review>< name>

<review>I heartily recommmend Dr. Hada and his family practice for the care and attention given to every patient. All the staff make one feel at home with care and attention which help with nervousness which many of us have at times!. In this practice, a patient is part of the family and not a number. The front office staff make great efforts to accommodate busy schedules in a pleasant and professional manner, and as the first point of contact, are an excellent reflection of the practice.<//review><user_id>114555435717578842186<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Dr Hada is absolutely without a doubt hands down the best dentist!
I used to see my local family dentist twice a year. Then it was sold & bought by another company. The last dentist, (before Dr Hada) I had a very, very bad experience. Swelling on right side, not able to chew, nothing hot/cold allowed on right side. Sharpe shooting pains. My husband knowing the pain I was in, told me about Dr Hada and asked that I just give Dr Hada a chance and for me to make my own opinion and judge for myself.  Hubby made the appointment (as I was stubborn and just done with dentist). Our (Dr Hada & Me) first meet-n-greet...I explained to Dr Hada about what happened to me with my last dentist. He was understanding, caring, patient and kind; but, more importantly he listened!  He Answered all my questions and concerns. He knew I was scared, nervous and I had major issues with eating on the right side and wasn't to fond of dentists.  Dr Hada sat down with me and took his time and explained everything in detail the step-by-step procedures until I felt comfortable. Appointment time 😳 ... I was extremely nervous (sorta shaking) when appointment time arrived (normal feeling). What took my last dentist (3) failed attempts to fix, to include a possible recommended tooth extraction (from last dentists 😳😡).
Dr Hada fixed it in less than an hour without a tooth extraction.😍 (The issue was merely a cap not sealed properly by last dentist.🙄)
I was extremely happy with the results. Let's just say for the first time in almost 1 1/2years I was able to actually eat on the right side without pain and/or discomfort. I have been going to Dr Hada ever since.
I highly, HIGHLY recommend Dr Hada to all my family and friends. He loves his patients, the staff are absolutely amazing, fun loving and make you feel wanted and welcomed. 😊
Dr Hada enjoys what he does. You see it not only in his work but also through his patients.
If you don't want to take my word; make an appointment with Dr Hada's office and make your own observation and judge for yourself - 😊  you will be happy- thank you again Dr Hada and staff...you guys are awesome and made it a lot more pleasant and trusting for me to go back to a dentist again 😍<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_id>

I've had cleanings and fillings as well as cosmetic work done and the outcome is always awesome.  Ive had problems with previous dentists over-diagnosing, but Dr. Hada always walks me through my options and I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

I can't say enough about how amazing my experiences to Hada Family Dental have been. The office is impeccably clean and welcoming, and the staff could not be nicer. Everyone, from the front desk to the dental staff were so pleasant and it was like visiting friends. Dr. Hada was very clear about what the steps were during the visit so that I could anticipate what to expect which was very nice. And, while having dental work done, I was able to relax and watch HGTV which was truly awesome. I actually end up looking forward to my next dentist visit.</Review>

<Text>WOW, Five Stars! I had a problem tooth and like many people I procrastinated until  the pain was too much.  I scheduled an appointment to have my tooth pulled.  I had had it.  Dr. Cole was able to save my tooth and at far less the cost than I expected. Dr. Cole and her associate Amber were AMAZING.  Super professional, super skilled, super easy to talk to.  I can't wait to go back. The two ladies at the front desk were amazing too. I'm sorry I forgot to get their names. The first time I went one of them stood up, welcomed me, and shook my hand. What's going on?  They're bending over backwards to provide a very positive experience, that's what's going on.  I told my wife and daughter and they'll be going soon. WOW., Five Stars!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Have never been to a dental practice this welcoming. From the front desk staff through the hygienists to Dr. Hada, these guys know customer service. Referred here by a friend, and I'm so glad I gave them a look. I'm a pediatrician, and I'm so impressed with the gentle way I watched everyone interact with their patients. I don't love going to the dentist, but I'm almost looking forward to my next visit to Hada Family Dental.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

We had a great experience at Hada Family dental.  Their office staff thoroughly explained the follow up treatment, including the billing prior to setting up the appointment. The  front office staff, hygienists and Dr. Hada  are are professional and personable. A great experience!!< /text>

Dr. Hada and his team are the ultimate professionals. Great service from the phone call all the way to checking out at the end of my appointment. A big thank you to the care and detail you guys take to make the experience so nice!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Cullen has been my dentist since I was 3 years old. My whole family has been seeing him for 20 plus years. He has become not only our dentist, but seems like a part of our family now. I have had both Aubrey and Brianne clean my teeth. They are both extremely gentle and do an amazing job. If you are looking for a new dentist, give the doctors and staff at Hada Family Dental a chance to be a part of your family!</text><Date>1410457257961</Date><Name>Dana Aaron</Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>102898988889132029919<//user_id>< gmapID>

I was referred to Hada Family Dental from a dear friend of mine a little over a month ago. Friend referrals are the best -- super honest and extremely trustworthy. I am very particular with my overall dental health care and had yet to find a practice in OC that I genuinely liked. Personally, a dental hygienist makes or breaks my experience (they do all of the important work!) My friend couldn't stop raving about her dental hygienist, KELLEY!!! I knew I was overdue for a cleaning, so I booked an appointment with her immediately. When I scheduled my appointment I learned that Kelley's first available was a little over a month out. I was completely fine with that, in fact, I took it as a great sign. I want someone who is popular and busy.

This morning was my first appointment...The office is absolutely beautiful, immaculate, and state of the art. The front office personnel was warm and welcoming upon arrival (despite my tardiness). I had my new patient paper work and insurance information filled out in advance. The new patient forms are easily accessible on their website. So convenient!

My actual teeth cleaning with Kelley was a breeze. During my cleaning I watched television on a flat screen mounted to the ceiling (amazing) and kicked back in the comfortable oversized chair. Not only did Kelley make me feel extremely comfortable, but she thoroughly explained every single move she was making. She gave suggestions to improve gum health without lecturing and provided suggestions for preventative care. Kelley is a real gem and I could not be more grateful for the referral.
Her cleaning was meticulous and my teeth feel great. I HIGHLY recommend Kelley!! She's well worth the wait!</Review>

I used to be super anxious about going to the dentist, but that changed once I started going to Hada Family Dental. All of the associates are extremely friendly and make you feel right at home which was different from a lot of other offices I've been to. I am so happy to have found Hada Family Dental!< /Review>

<text>OMG, ok I love going to the dentist...said no one ever!  Well, I can't say that I LOVE going to the dentist but I love this dental office staff and no longer fear going, now that I found Hada family dental office and just FYI I drive about 65 miles one way, I honestly look forward to going.  Let me just say that the staff there is AMAZING from the front office to the back office.  I recently had to have a bridge and it took a few visits and from the first visit to the last I had the pleasure of having the amazing duo of Dr. Cole, simply amazing dentist  and the awesome assistant Kimberly Jones, Kimberly has the ability to just make you calm and comfortable from start to finish and her knowledge and experience and the love for what she does just shines!  I am a forever patient of Hada Family Dental, thank you to all of you for providing and pleasant atmosphere and experience, I will recommend your office any chance I get<//text>< pictures>

Dr. Hada and his team are incredible. I have been to many different dentists over the years and Dr. Hada is hands down the BEST dentist that I have been to. From the moment you walk into their office, you are greeted by their warm and friendly office staff. Dr. Hada is always smiling and ready to help you in any way he can.
I am someone who NEEDS a good dentist because I have a lot of work that needs to be done. Dr. Hada was very pragmatic and practical about approaching my most pressing issues first. He let me know honestly what needs to be done and what could wait. I respect and appreciate his openness and honesty in making his professional recommendations. In addition, his WORK is top notch. The work he has done has been the best that I have received (and I have had a lot of work done over the years).
Dr. Hada’s office staff are very friendly and helpful. I had a question about Dental Insurance and Dr. Hada had me sit down with Rita to go over various options. Rita was very thorough and extremely helpful in helping me understand what would be best for me regarding dental insurance coverages. I was grateful for the help in navigating something that can be very confusing.
I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Hada’s office and have nothing but great things to say about his team and his office.<//Text>

I, like most people get anxiety going to the dentist, especially when the drill is involved. Dr. Hada was as smooth as butter, and my anxiety was gone within the first five minutes of the procedure, and yes, the dreaded drill was involved. I had two fillings replaced, which required two numbing shots, for that fun drill. I never felt pain, and Dr. Hada's assistant Kim was awesome. She talked me through the entire procedure explaining what Dr. Hada was doing. Great experience! Great Dr., great staff, great office!!< /Text>

The whole office couldn't be more professional.  Dr. Hada is a master at administering local anesthesia.  He keeps apologizing for pain I never feel!!   I am always very comfortable with his diagnosis, recommendations, and treatment plan. I've been going to this office for years, and they treat me like family! I could not recommend this dental practice any higher than i do!!</Text>

Dr. Hada is one of the most honest and up front individuals I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and doing business with. He'll let you know if he thinks you don't need any work done, instead of other dentists who perform repair work when not needed.  I will never go to a different Dentist again. The day Dr. Hada retires, i'm getting wooden teeth as I'm not sure I trust any dentist like I trust him.  If you're on the fence about finding a new Dentist, you HAVE to give Hada Family Dental a shot. You won't be disappointed.

I recently went to Dr. Hada for a cleaning and while I was there it was discovered that I needed a filling replaced. When I came back for the replacement filling, some numbing was required. I was a little worried since injections aren't the most fun you can have at the dentist, but I didn't feel a thing! Dr. Hada and his staff were very careful about having topical numbing before the injection and Dr. Hada took his time administering the injections so that I didn't feel anything. The procedure also went perfectly! Would recommend to anyone looking for a dentist.<//Text>

<Text>Dr. Carlston and his staff took such good care of me and I had a great experience at Hada Family Dental. I had a lot of work done and was fairly nervous, but Dr Carlston was very professional and helped me feel comfortable through the whole experience. Dr Carlston also followed up with me the next day to make sure I was doing well and he really went the extra mile to make my experience as pleasant as it could be. I will be returning and recommending this practice family and friends.<//Text>< rating>

< Review>
I have been a patient of Dr. Hada's for the last year following my former dentist's retirement. During the last 12 months I have had general cleanings done as well as 3 crowns needed to be made recently. I continue to experience excellent service from Dr. Hada, as well as his staff from dental assistants Kim and Amanda, to front office staff Lynn, Rita and Carol. Dr. Hada and his dental assistants have shown great 'chair side manners' and keep you appropriately informed along the way on any major procedures that you are having done. There followup is also excellent with Dr. Hada available by phone after hours if the need arises. Dental work is not fun, but these individuals and others in Dr. Hada's office provide a calming and welcoming atmosphere, not to mention very good results. Jim M< /Review>

<Text>I have always dreaded seeing the dentist.
But after a nagging tooth ache and some embarrassing discolration and cavity. I decided to go. Hada family dental is the only place i will be seen. The staff is warm and welcoming but what really made the trip bearable is Dr. Cole she is professional and personable which is a great combination. Dr. Cole eased my stress with her demeanor and personality. She was able to save my tooth from a a root canal. Most importantly she filled the cavity in my front teeth. Now i can smile without hesitation. Thank you Dr. Cole and everyone at Hada family dental.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Dr. Hada is the best dentist I've ever dealt with. I have acid reflux that can sometimes do a number on my teeth so I've seen a few dentists. After having several bad experiences elsewhere Rich has restored my trust in dentists. He is a master of his art from dental work to making sure you are 100% compfortable. All the staff is super friendly and accomodating.</text>

If you want to go to a dental practice that takes care of you from the moment you walk through the door this is your place. All the staff (front office, RDA's, RDH's) are all so friendly and have ample experience so you know you're in good hands. Of course the owner, Dr. Hada, who is a family friend, is an exceptional Dentist!

Today for example I got an old silver filling taken out and it was replaced with white composite. Eber, the RDA, was very nice and numbed my gums prior to the maxillary nerve block shot. When Dr. Hada went in with the shot I didn't feel a thing! This is mostly due to the fact that he took his time to slowly release the numbing agent. I appreciated him putting my comfort level as a priority, most dentists probably wouldn't have taken the time to do that since they have many patients to see. He also walked me through what he was doing and made sure I was comfortable during the whole procedure. Its little things like that that make a huge difference in a dental visit. I am already looking forward to my next cleaning.

Call and make an appointment today, you will not regret it!<//text>

< review>
This review is long overdue!  We have been going to Dr. Hada for many years, first at OC Dental Specialists then when we followed him to Hada Family Dental.

He is the most gentle, caring and patient dentist I have ever been to, and I have him to thank for restoring my smile and my sense of dignity.  I have had a lot of major work done, some of which was fixing what other dentists had done improperly, and I have to say he has been a godsend.

Everyone in the office is just as nice, and you feel like they are genuinely happy to see you.  While this office isn't as aesthetically pleasing as his old office, I gladly drive the extra distance just to be seen at this new office.

I know this sounds all gushy, but having been through so many other dentists, it is a huge relief to find one that cares, is proficient, and where you don't feel fleeced at the end of the visit.<//review>

It's awesome to have someone who is as detail oriented as Dr. Hada.  It seems like a lot of dentists just pump you in and out of their office––but Rich makes you feel like you're his only patient.</text>

<name>Elwood J. Hullinger</name>< review>
Huge fan of Dr. Hada and his staff. He replaced some silver fillings of mine that were long overdue for replacement. What I especially appreciated was that there was one tooth that possibly needed a root canal, but he wasn't eagerly looking to do the more costly procedure (I automatically think that everyone is like a bad auto mechanic and will do everything to upsell and make a buck) and given that the tooth looked healthy, we did the "wait and see" approach, and the pain subsided eventually -- as he had predicted. That kind of honesty and expertise goes a long way with me. He's also been great with my 6 and 4 year olds, so it's nice to have a 1 stop shop.

UPDATE: I've been a patient of Dr. Hada's for a long time and I try to see him still even though I now live in Salt Lake City. This week I was in town for work and tried to get in to see Dr. Hada but he wasn't able to accommodate on such short notice, but luckily Dr. Chase Carlston was able to see me and I was able to get the work done during my short trip to California. Thanks Dr. Carlston, and good job Hada Family Dental for bringing in another solid dds.< /review>

Sorry, but not a great experience. Ordered two burritos, two separate orders. Each order in the burrito was the bottom portion was a clump of refried beans rather than spread out.</review>

<text>It is the worst customer service ever.. They would not sell me food because I had my vitamin drink with me..The owner must be starving for money. Even if i brought my own drink i was getting it to go.. I would of bough the drink there, but they dont have it.. The guy taking the order was rude and didnt even let me talk.. He is a rude SOB...Never again!! They are not the only restaurant in town!! Hahaha found something better on slason and Holmes by the metro station.!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Their menrlitas are amazing and a little spicy, but ohh they are so worth it. I love their cemitas, they come with plenty of meat, they however are always kind of lacking on their papalo. The huaraches are also great just make sure if you get Cesina tell them to cut it up for you if not it gets a little messy to cut your big peice of meat on top of your hurache.</Text>

Try the quesadilla, the tortilla is made of fresh flour when you order and is super delicious, their salsa is amazing, and the overall platter is delectable!</text>

The Best place ever for cemitas poblanas authentic. been to other places but does not compare. I also recommend Tacos Arabes its different from ordinary tacos. they're so delicious they use a special sauce that gives it that explosion of flavors in your  taste buds.</Review>

The typical garnachas of the DF are the best, it is one of my favorite places.

(Translated by Google) The food is very rich but the attention of the staff is arrogant and rude! From the owner who does not allow them to give extra sauce to the one who makes the orders! I do not recommend it at all! Our money is worth we are paying and they serve you as if you were alms. They do not specify their menus and then make you keep what you have not asked for. Do not support these places. Ay better places.

(Original)
La comida es muy rica pero la atención del personal es con prepotencia y grosera! Desde el dueño que no permite que den salsa extra hasta la que hace las órdenes ! No lo recomiendo en lo absoluto ! Nuestro dinero vale estamos pagando y te atienden como si fueras limosnero . No especifican sus menús y después hacen que te quedes con lo que no has pedido . No apoyen estos lugares . Ay lugares mejores .<//review>

< review>
John is a such an great, honest mechanic and I wish I could give his shop 10 stars. We were on a road trip last week from San Francisco to San Diego to take our kids to Legoland when road debris punched a hole in our air conditioning condenser leaving us with no ac in 90 degree heat. After visiting/calling every shop between Buellton and Santa Barbara I found John at EZ Automotive. They were busy but he wanted to help us out and man was he a life saver. He kept me in the loop on the status, shuttled me to the hotel we had to stay in, and even brought the car to us so we could get back on the road faster. Big thanks to John and his crew for the best mechanic service ive ever encountered.< /review>

John is the best Mechanic of all in Santa Barbara. He helped me a many times with my Dodge Ram B 1500 1996.
Everytime I pick my van up she is just back to perfect again, and I roll smothly with a big smile out again.
Thank's John you are the best and a guy with the biggest heart I have known.
I really appreciate you John a lot.
Wish you the best in your future.</Text>

John and Chris were excellent. Very courteous and knowledgeable. I’ve been through four other mechanics in Santa Barbara who either didn’t know enough about cars or offered unfair prices for repairs. I will be going to EZ as long as I live in Santa Barbara.<//review>

<text>John and his team are amazing. I've had a hard time finding a mechanic in town that I really like and trust and I definitely found that here. Great work at a more than fair price! Will come back for any other issues in the future, in addition to routine maintenance. Thanks John!< /text>< pictures>

John and Dennis are top quality.  They really listen and give off very genuine qualities with their communication and work ethic.  This is a small shop and it can get busy, especially in the beginning of the week.  Do yourself a favor and call ahead before going.< /Text>

<Review>John and the EZ Automotive team did a great job of fixing up the car I brought in.  There was an issue with the lane-assistance sensors and they persisted until they were able to sort it out!  Highly professional, friendly, and got the job done!</Review><Date>1583354277160</Date>< pictures>

They are professional, fast, thorough and honest!
and on top of that will not break the bank!
I have been there now for a couple of things happening with my 2015 Jeep, such as car overheating, air conditioning not working and general check on breaks and oil. They are amazing!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

A friend told me about EZ Automotive as a good choice for honest quality at a fair price. So I went and met John who turned out to be just that! The shop, the crew, and the service all complimented the great price & his approach to fixing what is needed, not spending unnecessary dollars. Stand up guy, lots of skill and knowledge. Thanks John<//Review>

John has provided multiple services for our vehicles and has been great at diagnosing and repairing at a very good price. He is also extremely nice and was very prompt in finishing the work. I highly recommend him.

Update 7/10/17
A front strut went out on our Lexus just as we were about to sell it. John got it fixed very quickly so that we wouldn't lose the out-of-town buyer. And he did it under his warranty as an added bonus. The best and most trustworthy mechanic we've dealt with.</Review>

<Review>As a lifelong Santa Barbara resident, I've been very lucky to keep my list of auto mechanics pretty short.  Just a handful of trusted friends and family have really ever had to get under the hood.  I'm happy to say that John is no exception to that rule!  He brings an element of personal touch and good nature to his profession and what a pro he is!  From personally giving you a ride when you're in a jam to keeping you informed throughout every step of the repair, John is the man.  Quick yet thorough and competitively priced.  I can't recommend him enough!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80e913845aa97c5d:0x21983089bf0dca97< /GmapID></record>

They always get me in and out as quickly as possible which is very much appreciated. I just wanted to say thanks guys, your doing a great job.  See you in 5000 miles!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

After a friend recommended EZ Automotive to me, I called and spoke with John about coolant in my oil. He quickly texted me with a quote much lower than anywhere else and believe me, I did my research. I called just about every auto repair shop in Santa Barbara. John's quote was the lowest and he was also a pleasure to work with.

We thoroughly weighed my options and he contacted me just about every day on the progress on my new engine. Not once did I feel like he was trying to squeeze money out of me or pressure me into a more expensive repair like some other shops do.

At the end, I mentioned to John that the inside of my car was dirty from sitting there with the windows down on a windy day at the shop and he had the interior wiped up and had the exterior washed for free. Also, he waived the extra labor involved due to some unforeseen problems with a part that I had supplied to him for the job.

John and his only other mechanic, Sebastian, are great guys and perform honest work. I'll be bringing my car only here for future work.

To sum it up: Low prices and unbeatable service. There isn't much more you can ask for. Their 5 star rating you see on here and Yelp isn't a fluke either. They really are the best shop in town.</Review>

John is an awesome guy! Not only does he know his stuff and has reasonable rates but he runs a great place - Even his employee that he had there toward the end of the day was in a good mood. In my opinion that is a sign of a great place to work. A+!< /Text>

Given the holiday weekend, we thought we'd be stuck there until Monday. John actually called us back on Thanksgiving when our car was towed to his shop to let us know he'd received it and would begin working on it first thing in the morning. He got us up and running by Friday evening and saved our trip. Very reasonable prices and great customer service!<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>I found EZ Automotive and John via referral from a friend. As a new resident of Santa Barbara it was great to find EZ. John has fixed a slow leak in my tire and I've had an oil change. I hope my car doesn't need any major work but I know I can trust John and EZ Automotive if anything comes up.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I went to John because other mechanics were not willing to help me solve my problem. John was willing to help me rebuild some shocks for my vintage honda which required the kind of ethic and creative thinking that other mechanics didn't have. Because of his problem solving tenacity, I get to keep my little honda on the road.

John is by far one of the best mechanics in town. He can quickly identify problems and seem them through, from A to Z.</Text>< gmapID>

John is a great mechanic with a great deal of experience, and in my opinion very honest and trustworthy. He has serviced our Priuses and RX450h for a couple years now, and we have always been happy. When we brought the 450h in for a pre-purchase inspection, he spent over an hour looking all around and under the car, brought up several issues that we were happy to know about and were able to use as negotiating points, and then refused to take payment for the inspection. He provides such good service that he knew we'd be back to him to service the car for years. Which we will.</Text>

<Text>Further to my earlier review of John Birchall and EZ Automotive, Santa Barbara (below), I have being going to him now for four years with three different vehicles. He has never let me down on the work or a very fair price even when major complications set in. He has just (Aug 2020) helped me get money back on a radiator replacement at a DIFFERENT repair shop when the item was arguably out of warranty. I can't say enough about him or his staff for their excellence.

****

Excellent experience and I will definitely do business here again. I hoped new rear shock absorbers would stop a rattle from the back of my Nissan truck. Owner John, a really good guy, gave me a great quote, spent extra time checking the whole underside of my truck in case it wasn't the shox, re-tightened bolts and removed the wheels for possible problems. We didn't cure the rattle but I had no regrets at having the work done.

It seems so hard to get an estimate or arrange work for almost anything these days. You either get a voicemail or are passed from one person to another. John answered the phone himself, texted me a written quote and arranged an appointment for the next morning with no playing phone tag. All done before some other companies ever responded. I couldn't ask for better service.<//Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is a place where you can trust, because they explain that you have your car, that they will do it and they will fix it, they also do not charge you more and are very friendly.

(Original)
Es un lugar en donde tu puedes confiar , por que te explican que tiene tu auto, que le van hacer y te lo arreglan, ademas no te cobran de mas y son muy amables.</review>

Obviously we love Big Bear! The village has made a lot of improvements over the years (like heated sidewalks) despite the amount of shops that have gone out of business. 😔 We’d really love for the historical society to put up plaques telling visitors about the local history.< /Text>

A quaint little shopping village with a nice rustic atmosphere. You can shop anything from rustic, to modern, art to dining. I nice leisurely stroll will avail you of much to see and more to do. Plus between the backdrop of the mountains and the lake you can't much beat the scenery</Text>

This is one of the most beautiful areas in Southern California. It’s definitely a tourist area and a little pricey but I go for the skiing, beautiful views, and hiking trails.</Review>

Hot and ready is supposed to mean just that, not wait and get a cold pizza. No direction from a manager telling employees what to do they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Usually its ok, idk whats happened.<//text>

< review>
As of 2020, this location sells pizzas for 7$ to compensate for minimum wage, the only place I've seen to actually raise prices. They used to sell them for 6$, even though advertised for 5$ on television. I will no longer give the greedy owner of this establishment my business.

I rate this 2 stars instead of one only because the associates here are so kind. Otherwise, people like the owner here are the problem with this county being so expensive.< /review>

Staff at this location, is always polite and friendly! The store is always clean, and the pizza is good, for the price. It's a bit hot and miss, but I recommend ordering it " well done" therefore, you'll always get a fresh pizza, right out of the oven and it's cooked so much better when you order it this way!<//Text>

I got a pepperoni pizza and some bread sticks and enjoyed them very much. Both were hot and fresh. I didn't have to wait I was the only one there. The place was clean and the people working was very nice and polite. I will go back anytime soon.</review>

Great job! Hot, fresh, fast, quality is better than the other pizza takeout chains. Wish they had fresh garlic as a topping choice. Staff is friendly and well-trained. And the price is the cheapest around... how could you go wrong?</Text>

Every time I go into a Little Caesars I am greeted immediately by the staff my order is taking quickly and they let you know before you order if their debit card machine is down in some Sacramento areas I have heard that they accept EBT cards but don't quote me on that if you ask for a fresh pizza to be made it will be made fast although the staff will try to sell you a hot and ready stick to your guns if you like fresh pizza as much as I do your be willing to wait an extra 5 minutes to get gooey hot cheese</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

If you want cheap pizza I recommend Pizza Express instead, but when it's closed you have to go here. If you ask for a pizza fresh they don't mind at all, and the staff is pretty nice.< /Text>

I had a wisdom tooth that came in alone that was causing serious pain and headaches that was so hard to bear. I got a referral for this oral surgeon and when I called not only were the receptionists extremely friendly and knowledgeable, they were able to get me in the next day! When I arrived every single one of the staff members working were so friendly and efficient I couldn’t have been more pleased. Once it came time for the tooth removal a staff member let me know that the Dr. is amazing and I wouldn’t feel a thing. She was not lying!! Dr. A had the tooth removed in what felt like a minute. (Was probably 5 minutes and that’s only because I needed more numbing!!) totally painless, he talked me through it while doing it and was done. Couldn’t be more impressed with the effective friendly service they provided me with. 10/10 definitely recommend!!!<//Review>

I had a good experience. I was called into the office right on time and went straight to the chair after Covid check-in. There was an issue with a disk that I brought from my dentist. They couldn't open it, but kept trying and kept me informed all the time. Dr. Alijanian came in, and after seeing my scan, explained what needed to be done. The fees were then explained and I left feeling like I knew what my options were.< /review>

Dr. Alijanian's office has been very easy to work with even through: our own delays due to person health concerns, COVID, and then a scramble to try to get wisdom teeth removed before school started. They have been very reassuring and listen to our concerns, they have given clear instructions, and my daughter had an excellent outcome. I highly recommend them if you need an oral surgeon.< /Text>

Dr Alijanian and his staff are wonderful - so friendly, professional and on top of all the details!! Oral surgery at any level is a stressful event but they take out all the stress and put everyone at ease! My 2nd child is getting his wisdom teeth removed and I have confidence it will go as smoothly as the first child’s experience … with amazing professionalism and bedside manner AND consideration towards the stressed mom. :)<//Text>

I went in for a consultation and the doctor said he could pull the tooth right away if I wanted. He explained the procedure and said there would be a lot of pressure and some noise but no pain this procedure took after I was administered the novacain less than three minutes. I almost feel I didn’t get my money’s worth. They explained to me what I needed to do after the extraction and it’s now been a week and everything is just fine. This was a real easy procedure and I’m now after a long time pain free. This tooth was imbeded for over 30 years before it finally came out. I had another tooth pulled out to get this tooth to surface it took 5 years and it came in jagged a back molor that was imbedded. Thank you doctor I’m now pain free and you made it easy every step of the way.</review>

<text>I do not remember ever having a doctor do any kind of work on me in whom I have had more confidence than I had in Dr. Alijanian. To say he is THE BEST is quite an understatement.

< review>
Dr. Alijanian is a terrific oral surgeon. He removed a large implant post/anchor with minimal pain that had been screwed into my lower jawbone, since 2016.  And 4 days later I have not experienced any residual pain since the operation. He is obviously very experienced and the whole procedure lasted only 20 minutes. This implant had been causing substantial bone loss as well as gum tissue deterioration due to incorrect placement 4 years ago. He and his staff are all very cordial and professional. A great team..!</review>

Today, I finished my consultation, x-rays and scan. The staff is friendly, welcoming and resourceful. They made sure I was well-informed with critical information and prep instructions. My first implant, from Ali Alijanian, DDS, was successful and this will be my 2nd implant that he will perform next month.</Text>

I came in to have 4 wisdom teeth removed. The staff was extremely friendly. The procedure was very quick. The staff and DR walked me through the treatment plan and was very consistent with following up and ensuring that I was prepared for surgery. Post procedure the staffed called and check on me frequently and answered all of my questions.

I would definitely recommend a friend!< /Text>

I was treated with such care and respect from the moment I came through the doors .
Dr. Alijanian was so personable and caring, explaining every aspect of what needed to be done and the complete procedure. He was patient and thorough inviting all my questions.
Elaina, the coordinator then spent as much time as I needed, making me feel comfortable and reassured, taking even more time. I can’t thank them enough for their making me feel like I was the guest of honor at an event to look forward to. And I do!</Text>

<date>1488562593757<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I was a bit nervous.   Many people told me I might be sick for days.. that it was painful... that it took a while to get the teeth removed.  Not the case for me.  An amazing experience.  In and out in about 30 minutes total, no ibuprofen needed 24 hours later, and back to work the next day.  Eating normally 4 days later.

Not only was the dental experience positive, but the staff and doctor were by far some of the friendliest people I had ever met.  On time, extremely friendly, and extremely hospitable.  I wish they did routine dentist work!  If I ever need any kind of work done on my teeth again, I will definitely make sure to come here.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Alijanian is the best oral surgeon so if you need anything I would recommend you contact Dr. Alijanian for a consultation. You see by the website all he offers and how complicated the surgeries can be. I had full top mouth implants almost a rear ago and just did the lower mouth last week. You are not afraid when you see his website and read all his patient reviews. People have the best experiences! Oh, and you won’t be disappointed when you see the office decor. Dr. Alijanian has the best fish tank ever!!!<//Review>

< Review>
I saw Dr. Alijanian today for extraction of my bottom right back molar, tooth #31. Dr. Alijanian was very pleasant and reassuring. He was extremely competent and worked amazingly, almost unbelievably fast. From the time he said "open wide" and the assistant inserted the mouth guard, Dr. Alijanian extracted the tooth, cleaned out the infection, sutured the gums, and announced we were done in what seemed like less than two minutes. I would highly recommend him to anyone.< /Review>

<text>Suffering with extreme pain caused by a broken tooth, I contacted Dr. Alijanian's office the morning after New Year's Day. I had no referral but was aware of their office because it is close to where I live. When I called and explained my situation, the woman I spoke with could not have been more friendly and accommodating. After checking their appointment schedule for the day, she arranged an appointment for me for noon on that day! When I arrived, I was welcomed by a friendly, caring staff, and felt as though I had been a long-time patient, even though this was my first time there. A staff member explained the procedure and made me feel at ease, then Dr. Alijanian and his surgical assistant, Alyssa, further eased any anxiety I was feeling and performed the procedure. Their skill and professionalism was obvious, as I felt comfortable and relaxed, and was amazed at how quickly they completed the procedure! I had virtually no pain or discomfort during my recovery either; something I consider another testament to the Dr. Alijanian's extraordinary skill.</text><name>ALIVEEASTBAY<//name></record>

Thank you to Dr. Alijanian, Alyssa, and Paula. I am grateful the office was able to squeeze me into a busy Monday schedule for a painful tooth that needed to come out. I can appreciate the efficiency and professionalism of this office greatly. Alyssa was wonderful in preparing for all I needed to know. Dr. Alijanian is obviously a pro, greatly skilled, and gracious. Thank you so very much for everything. I highly recommend the office of Dr. Ali Alijanian, DDS. Merci!</text>

<Text>Arrived early, checked in, and didnt have to wait long until Marissa came to get me.  I had a tooth extracted a couple of months ago and this was a check up to see where we go from here.
From the minute you walk in the door the staff treats you so well.  After my consultation with the doctor I had an xray taken to check where the tooth had been.  Their equipment is state of the art.  They are thorough and professional and run the most efficient office I have ever seen.  After I talked with Paula about finances I was able to pay her in the room.  I was in and out of there in nothing flat without ever feeling rushed.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Amazing experience.  Dr. Knows his stuff!  Quick in and out surgery.  Super sweet nurses and office staff.  So welcoming and warm!  Patient tentative knowledgeable kind.  Gave us all the time we wanted to ask questions.  Followed up with a call later that night.  My sons had another doctor.  This time my daughter had a SUPER EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE with this doctor!!!  Highly recommend.  Incision, stitches, surgery site impeccable!  Quick recovery from 4 impacted wisdom teeth in a flash of time.  Very little swelling.  Between boys doctor and this doctor DAYLIGHT AND DARK.  Recommend  recommend recommend!

Went back a year later and had my wisdom tooth which was wrapped around a nerve pulled  and again this doctor is BY FAR the best!  I’m 58 and lived in this area all my life.  I know what I’m talking about when I say the best!</text>< rate>

<Text>Was recommended to go to Dr Alijanian to pull out a few wisdom teeth. Dr. Ali was too harsh and made the procedure painful. When I brought the pain to his attention he was rude and didn’t do anything about it. To top it all off I later found out I could have gone elsewhere for a lot cheaper.

<review>Dr. Alijanian and his staff are great.  Over a span of months, he removed a tooth, implanted bone in my jaw and also placed an implant to serve as a mount for a replacement tooth..  I am no stranger to the dentist chair and I could not ask for better comfort during the procedures or better results.  I highly recommend Dr. Alijanian and his staff.</review>< Time>

Dr. Alijanian's office is amazing. Both the Doctor and his staff are extremely helpful and accommodating. Everyone at the office made me extremely comfortable with the procedure and what it would entail. From billing to scheduling to the actual procedure it was a fluid process. Dr. Alijanian is an artist and I would unequivocally recommend anyone to him and his office.</Text>

Very Nice Experience
Had an evaluation appointment for some extractions and implants. Front desk was awesome as was Dr. Alijanian and his staff. They explained everything, made me feel at ease (which is not easy for me in a dentist chair), and even provided me with some financial options and procedure planning. They got me a very quick appointment to have the work done. I will provide another review after my procedures but I am confident everything will be fine.

How do you equate a 'pleasant experience' with oral surgery? See Dr. Alijanian!
Seeing an oral surgeon is certainly not something people look forward to. I was really nervous when I went to see him for an extraction. His amazing staff made me feel at ease and made sure I understood every step of the process. Dr. Alijanian was cordial and professional, and provided a very comfortable (and quick!) extraction. I highly recommend him - and his staff!

Everyone in the office is friendly and helpful and Dr. Alijanian is a great man who really puts in the extra effort and care for his patients. He looked at my teeth and explained everything to me clearly and concisely. I went in a week later for my wisdom teeth removal, the whole surgery was quick and painless and I was fully recovered a few days later. Would recomend him to anyone.<//text>

<text>I had a loose tooth that needed to be extracted - something I was dreading.  My dentist referred me to Dr. Alijanian.  When I  went for the consultation, I was impressed by the professional friendliness of the staff and the stylish office.  Dr. Alijanian is very approachable and described the procedure to me, which put me at ease.

On the day of the procedure, I was promptly whisked into the room, where the Dr. and his assistants were waiting for me.  I sat down in the very comfortable chair and within seconds, I was breathing the laughing gas and...the next thing I remember the procedure was over and I was off to the recovery room, with no pain.  I was in and out of the office in less than an hour!

Recovery went much faster than I had expected and with no post-procedure pain.

I can’t recommend Dr. Alijanian and his office highly enough!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I had heard nothing but fabulous remarks of Dr. Alijanian & his team which is why I chose to come to him for a surgical extraction of my upper molar...& Im so happy I did! He extracted my tooth yesterday & I am still in awe of my experience.  From the ease of making the appointment, to the pleasant decor, the contagious smiles of his remarkable staff, affordable price, along with his unrivaled expertise and professionalism...I am more than happy to share my experience with anyone in need of his services :)

Thank you Dr. Alijanian & team for all your compassion & care!

I'm never happy going to the dentist but Dr Alijanian and his staff go out of thier way to make one feel as comfortable as possible. I highly recommend Dr Alijanian. My experience was for implants. I'm absolutely thrilled with my implants. This technology is remarkable.  Now off to my dentist for the finishing touches. Thank you, Dr Alijanian and staff.</review>

It's been a year. Was back for another project and they had everything I needed. Been back a few times in between. Once again, great service. Thank you!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Great customer service and they made my patio cover possible. Super friendly every time I go in there and someone is always available to help me find what I need. Great little store and it's easy to find things. Good selection on lumber and fast loaders. Nothing bad to say. Their location is only a few minutes from the freeway and I've never hit traffic getting there.< /text>< pics>

Great customer service, friendly helpful staff. Was able to find some redwood fence pickets that are hard to find currently at a fair market price, it wasn't the lowest price but everyone else is out so I am happy to have found it even at the highest price.< /review>

<review>Placed an online order for store pick up. Never received confirmation that it was available. 2 weeks later I called to inquire, only to find out that it had arrived earlier in the week. Then, when trying to pick up, it took forever to find my order. Beyond that, it is very hard to find any help in the lumber yard.< /review><UserId.>102311353641276748099<//UserId.></record>

<text>Love Meek's!

EDIT:  Today I went in, walked around, and left without buying anything because I couldn't find what I needed.   I saw at least 4 employees (and no other customers) while I walked around. Not a single person said hello or asked if I needed help.  Now I'm going to Home Depot 🙁<//text>< userid>

<review>They were amazingly helpful with my Eagle Scout Project. It was wonderful to work with staff on making sure I got everything I needed for the project and delivering it to the site in a timely fashion. The redwood they sold me was perfect for the job and posts were exactly what I had wanted! Thank you Meeks for Everything!!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Have used these folks for over 15 years.  Just great to work with.  Very experienced and knowledgeable staff.  Often much lower on prices than Home Depot or Lowe's.
Highly recommended.</text>

Actually went to order a front door because Therma-Pro said this was their 'gallery' store. Ummm well they had 5 doors not really what you can or should call a gallery store. The person who helped me took all my information was going to check on the availability of the door I wanted to order, she never called me back. I called her and I'm still waiting for that call back.... finally went to Lowes and ordered the door. Lacking customer service for sure.< /Review>

Let me start off by saying that freeway insurance has had the best quotes. And outstanding customer service Leslie Rubio help me out through the whole process step by step. Which made it fast and easy. Definitely my go-to person if you want to get it done stress free. Big thanks for all the help!<//text>

<Review>I went to Freeway after being frustrated by the whole online quote experience. I literally was bombarded by text and telephone by lead representatives who were relentless. It was a huge turn off.

After searching for a local agency I found Freeway. The hours were great, location nearby and the website was super informative and full of resources a person might need. I was sold. I went down to the office at 6 pm and was greeted and asked to sign in. Within a few minutes a young man named Christian approached me to let me know he would be assisting me. After I completed a few fields on a form we sat at a COVID safe counter and discussed my car insurance needs. He listened carefully and I gave him my id  and car registration. After about 5 minutes, he returned with an amazing quote, full coverage, good deductible and a premium I could afford. Not only was he professional and efficient, he also caught on that money was tight. I was there for less than 45 minutes. When I left I couldn’t believe how easy the process was and how quickly I was in and out, but also how great the service was. Now I have the piece of mind of a good policy and a go to person at Freeway. My friend who was with me was so impressed that she is considering changing her insurance to Freeway (and she has several cars). Thank you Christian Martinez for a job well done!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Bad place they are not helpful and when you want to add a vehicle they want you to change insurance company so they can charge you. They give you a lie saying they don't work with your current insurance provider. Jose is the one who helped me be aware.<//text>

<Text>I went online to get a quote from Southern California and within seconds I received a call from an assistant at Freeway Insurance that connected me to David Castillo in Northern California. From the first second until the last David was super friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. He quoted me the best price and within a short period of time walked me through my policy via email and I couldn't be more satisfied with his exceptional service.

< Review>
I feel disgusted walking in here. The manager told me, He couldnt help since, i didnt purchase policy at this branch. 3 agents were available and i was only customer present.
This is the worst branch in the  entire Bay Area. A cooperation with a big name and advertise ments. Not a franchise.
Customer service shouldnt be an issue!</Review>

Melissa was so professional and helpful, I couldn't have asked for a better agent. She was very knowledgeable and exceeded my expectations by far. I was dreading the process of getting car insurance but she actually made it pleasurable and fun.</Review>

I found this absurd. I called freeway and was forwarded over to Melissa Archer and Ralph Martinez who were both polite professional and searched across the board for better options for me. After doing research they offered me a quote for $58 monthly and beat all of their competitors. The process was quick and easy and only took 15 minutes total. I will be referring all of my friends and family to them and suggest you all give them a chance. They are great people with even better insurance quotes. Thanks so much for the help!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I was hesitant of coming into this location since the reviews stated that their was a long wait time. But when I came in I was greeted immediately by an agent named Melissa Archer. She was very inviting and we could relate over both having baby girls. She was able to help get me set up in a speedy time on my lunch break before I had to go back into work.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I went into the Freeway office in the Greenhouse shopping center and I was greeted by Melissa, Vanessa, and Diego who were all currently working on things. They still managed to take the time to make me feel welcomed and were very fast and efficient and detailed. Great customer service ! Highly recommend< /review>

< Review>
Wow at first I thought I made the right decision... i definitely regret it now. Came in on Friday to get non owners insurance. I have already put over $200 to start my policy. I specifically asked if I purchased a vehicle, could I upgrade my coverage. They said yes.

Today I called trying to get my car insured. They told me I have to start a new policy for full coverage and pay $381. That $200 that I put down is now gone. Doesn't carry over at all. They wanted me to keep both policies opened. That makes no sense at all.

I'm going to keep my insurance for now but will call that $200 a loss and go somewhere else. Would not recommend them at all. I  never try to blast anyone online but this highly upsetting.

I probably won't get a response back but I hope this will change the way you guys do business.</Review>

If it wasn't for him ,I would have went somewhere else.  I trusted him to get me the right policy for me and he did.  the other staff were friendly as well and willingly to help me anytime I came in.

I had the pleasure of buying my insurance from a young man named Robert.  He was honest and patient with me and ALLLLLLL of my questions. He made sure I understood everything in my policy anny's was completely satisfied with everything before I left. I felt comfortable investing my time and money with him. I'll be referring all of my friends and family in to see him. Good to experience wholesome, honest and quality sales professionals in this day and age. My hats off to such a great guy with good values. Thank you Mr. Robert!!!!!! You're amazing</review>

I have heard a few things about Freeway Insurance that made me a little weary of coming in but i was blown away by the amount of customer service i had received. I was immediately greeted by the manager who offered me water or coffee while we waited for an agent to be available. A young lady named Melissa Archer put my information in the system and was patient with me while going over the coverages and tailored a plan that worked for me. I was thinking about looking around still. I am new to insurance and wasnt sure what i should do. I was getting ready to head out when another agent named Robert Perez sat down with me and together they made me feel extreamly comfortable with this whole thing and they were able to work with me on the payment and set me up with an appointment. I will be coming back within a few days to complete this process. These two worked so well together and deserve all the recognition they could get. I highly recommend this office and these agents to anyone.< /text>

I was blown away by the great customer service from Diego Romero and Melissa Archer. I spent all day looking for insurance quotes and Diego was able to save me money with not only the initial down payment, but the monthly payment as well. Thanks a lot!< /Review>

<Text>Today I worked with Robert Perez.
I was desprately in need of insurance due to some unfortunate events that have happened recently. He was able to work with my budget and was extreamly understanding. I didnt expect this young man to carry himself the way he did. I have dealt with people way older who lacked the professionalism he had. For 19 years old and only being in this industry for the amount he has this kid is going places. I wouldnt be suprised if I call in and he is in charge.

I also dealt with his coworker Melissa and she guided me through all the paperwork efficiently! Great team, great experience!< /Text>< Date>

<Review>when I 1st got my insurance the young lady who helped me rushed my paperwork or something. I went back and forth over the phone with my insurance agency for weeks and nothing was done. I came into the san leandro branch and from the time i walked in Diego greeted me and made me feel like i was gonna get it all figured out. he heard my story and agreed 100% with me (which is uncommon) and was overly willing to help me out. Ralph stepped in heard my story and i was reinstated within about a hour. So I STRONGLY RECOMMED going in and talking with Diego Romero and Ralph Martinez. They went above and beyond and their customer service was EXCELLENT.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< username>

Never will I go through freeway insurance they give you great service during the opening policy but after that your on your own.  I don't know how many times I called and I got hung up on then they say talk to the person who opened your policy which his name was Emmanuel.  DMV never was able to confirm the insurance then the company that they said the policy was through said there was no policy got charged a fee from DMV because of them. Then they got mad when I cancelled the policy and tried to charge me again</text>

they say there are the cheapest
i hate this insurance they charged my like $450 non refundable sign up fee than they prorated me
The only reason why i am using it is because of my son who is under 25 who still has to pay $200

One time i call to add someones name to my insurance policy over the phone which took my whole lunch hour got hung up 3 times. they added the name said additional $115 would be added. They said to call back when i want to remove the name and they would remove it and take the charges off
So i call today to get it removed after they told me to call that they would refund me the $115 for adding a name now they said i have to go into the office and be charged $40 for removing the name i bet there will be more surprises< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Hello friends, I recommend that you get out of this fraudulent agency as soon as possible. They are going to get you in a lot of trouble AND stress. when they have a claim what to do. They charge me $ 107 per month ful Cover. For a car with a value of $ 2,500. Two weeks after I hired them, they bandalized my car. I made the claim hai was' when the worst experience of my life began. They accused me of fraud. They made me feel like a criminal. By then they had already withdrawn $ 327 from my bank account in just two weeks. They made me call like 10 different phone numbers each call it took me like 1 hour for them to tell me they couldn't do anything. Meanwhile they kept taking money out of my account. I told them to please cancel my policy. Hai started back nightmare. They made me send a signed paper canceling the policy. Two weeks later what we do not find send it again. After I had to go to an office in person, the charges keep piling up. To the point of having to change the bank card number. 😌

(Translated by Google) I wanted to add one more vehicle to my policy and I called customer service where they told me they could help me and that I had to go personally to the closest office; Unfortunately I had been busy and for a month I could not do the procedure; Well, the day came and I went to the closest office and due to the pandemic they had closed it permanently, I called customer service again to find another office and they contacted me at an office very far from my location, fortunately Deisy Iniguez a very kind person and patiently he did the procedure over the phone in 20 minutes, which made someone wait so long. Thank you Deisy, your attention was the best and that is why I decided to rate you with 5 stars

(Original)
Quería agregar un vehículo más a mi póliza y llamé a servicio al cliente donde me dijeron que me podían ayudar y que tenía que ir personalmente a la oficina más cercana; lamentablemente había estado ocupado y por un mes no pude hacer el trámite; pues llegó el día y fuí a la oficina más cercana y por la pandemia la habían cerrado permanentemente, volví a llamar a servicio al cliente para encontrar otra oficina y me contactaron a una oficina muy lejos de mí ubicación, afortunadamente Deisy Iniguez una persona muy amable y paciente me hizo el trámite por teléfono en 20 minutos , lo que alguien más hizo esperar tanto tiempo. Gracias Deisy tu atención fue de lo mejor y por eso decidí calificarte con 5 estrellas</text>

Well I  need some work done on my mouth and I first heard of Mira Mesa Dental from Instagram advertisement.  I really don't like going to the dentist but at my age I know it's necessary.  So I made my initial decision to go and I have to say that my experience thus far has been wonderful! Dr. Faris and the other clinicians are very knowledgeable! I had some questions and they answered them astutely! I have work to be done and I know that I've found a Dental office I can always come back to with my family!< /review>

I had a dental emergency from bad dental work done by another dentist.  I found Mira Mesa dental and called to see if they could see me. The front desk was so nice and kind and she got me an appointment super early the next day. I went in, was seen promptly and I feel like it was my best first visit to a dentist. Dr. Faris was so nice and kind. He was very attentive and genuinely cared about my problem and how I felt. And he took care of me and my issue immediately. I feel a lot better now. The office is super nice and clean and it just feels so great walking in. From the very first time I walked in until I left, I felt great and taken care of. I will have ALL of my dental work done here from now on. No need to look anywhere else. Thank you so much Mira Mesa Dental!! Highly recommended anyone to come and see them.<//Text>

Mira Mesa Dental & Orthodontic has distinguished itself for me over the past 15 years as the most consistently professional dentist I have dealt with. The office staff from the doctors, to the receptionists attend my every need for my dental  need. I have only the highest praise for the organization.< /Text>

FANTASTIC dental office!! I cannot sing enough praises about this place. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the dentists are thorough and informative.

I'm not a big fan of dentists, but I felt completely at ease and comfortable the whole time. I had to get a filling fixed and wasn't looking forward to the shots that numb. I didn't even feel them! No slight pinch, NOTHING!!!

When I informed them that my salivary glands tend to go on overdrive when I'm at the dentist, they actually made me feel better about that by saying that's a great thing to have! The assistant also made sure to suction frequently so I was comfortable the whole time.

I HIGHLY recommend this office, you will not be disappointed.< /Text>

They were all so kind and so helpful! They Made my girls feel so comfortable (3 And 1 years Old) they were fun and interactive showing them the tools they were using and explained everything to them as they were doing their cleaning. After the girls had their check ups it was my turn and they were so gentle the dentist even asked me several if I was comfortable. They explained further appointments with me and even happily filled out extra paperwork needed for my husband work! They were so great and I wish we went to them a lot sooner!<//Review></record>

I’ve been a patient of Mira Mesa dental for over 25 years now and I’ve always been so impressed and pleased with their care.  Although I personally don’t enjoy the dentist (who does?), the staff here makes for the best experience I could ask for.  Very professional and pleasant.  I highly recommend!</review>

Great customer service. I've been going here for years. I just moved out of state and I still plan my cleanings with when I go back home to Mira Mesa. They were really quick and their work was pretty painless.< /Text>

<text>Dr Faris was awesome and he is really good. Few weeks ago, I had a tooth extracted and bone graft. Today, I had a root canal. I was really impress with Dr Faris and the technology was great. At first, I was scared because I remembered my first root canal when I was young and the spike like needles was scary. Now, I’m not even afraid anymore if I need to do another root canal(hope not😀) especially if Dr Faris will do it. Also, thanks to assistant Sam. She was great and friendly.  Again, Thanks Doctor and the staff! I will definitely recommend this dental office. Oh, Thanks Janice😃<//text></record>

<text>Very professional doctors/staff and services provided. Very friendly and inviting atmosphere, if you ever had any fears of going to the dentist, the staff will ensure all is forgotten, even down to a very nice message chair to get you relaxed as possible.

The staff/doctors explained each step of the procedures to ease the fears and made the entire experience a successful process. Thank you for a positive experience and looking forward to the next visit.

I highly recommend Mira Mesa Dental and Orthodontist. Very pleased and still SMILING. 😎 Mr. “A”<//text></record></dataset><record>

I rarely write bad reviews but in this particular case I do feel like it is important for people NOT to visit this dental practice as they did me a huge disservice and tarnished my trust in dentists.  This was my first dental visit in 8 months in a new city.  They refused to do a routine cleaning due to the fact that they believed I needed a deep cleaning but diagnosed me with no cavities.  I found it hard to believe that as a routine dentist go-er (religiously every 6 months) that all of my numbers were so bad that a routine cleaning would be dangerous/ineffective.  I'm proactive about my dental health and generally know my gum numbers.  I (3 months later) went to another dentist that came highly recommended by a friend- they did the routine cleaning and diagnosed me with 5 cavities.  I ended up getting 2 crowns and filled the other 3.  I moved and ended up with a 3rd opinion- who also said that a deep cleaning was not necessary and that indeed from the XRay's they would have diagnosed the same cavities.  I'm not sure what this office's motivation was for refusing to do a general cleaning- if it was money, they sure missed out because I ended up getting $2k+ worth of dental work done else where.  I was especially upset as I took time away from my newborn to get this done.  Awful experience and I hope no one experiences the same.  I was seen by Haider Farris.</text>

Ugh, so it happened.  After many years of being cavity free, I was told I had the start of a couple (sad face).  It's been awhile since I had any dental work outside of a standard cleaning so I was a little nervous.  Today was my first experience with Dr. Lina who was very gentle and got my work done in under an hour.  Anything done was being explained and Dr. Lina and her assistant were always making sure I was okay.  I was very sad to hear that Dr. Johnson retired but I am very glad they found some very good people to step into the practice.  If you're looking for a gentle dentist, consider coming here.  Very clean office, nice view from your chair, good music in the background, and massage chair in the waiting room in case you're early.  Front desk also friendly and professional. Take care of your teeth and maintenance here (big smile).< /Review>

The moment I stepped into the office, I felt the good vibes of people who work there, from the reception area to the spot where I got treated.

Best dentist experience of my life, I can say that with the greatest confidence.

I’m a new patient; the start of my appointment was perfect, they knew who I was right away and make the  new patient application easy and seamless. I waited a total of 10 minutes in the lobby which is the expected amount of time, and was offered a beverage while I waited! The lobby was well kept and super clean, decorations are spot on as well.

The dentist experience was better than I expected, and that’s a positive! The first assistant did my xrays and made sure I was comfortable the entire time (those biting things can be a pain), the second assistant Melissa kept me informed of all dental options for my concerns and kept my budget in mind. Melissa also gave me GREAT advice on how to care for my teeth, with care that was tailored and specific to my mouth and my problem areas.

Dr Faris was amazing, I love being informed of everything they do and he was the absolute best at this! He not only informed me but educated me on how to really care for my teeth in the long term; I appreciate his care so much. He was gentle with my teeth and made sure I was comfortable the entire time of my visit.

So if this experience doesn’t convince you to come to this high quality, high service dentists office then nothing will.

A+/ Five Star/ two thumbs up for this office!!< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Unfortunately this review makes you give at least 1 star. Dr. Buffington and Jill are amazing but the office manager Cindy is horrible. I have been going to this dentist since 2013 and spent thousands of dollars here. I have always had my account on auto draft. Cindy took funds on unauthorized dates and never returned calls. I told them to disconnect my auto draft and waited for her call to set up a new plan. She never called but instead turned my account to collections. I have never been less appreciated as a client or treated so rudely in my life. I do not recommend this place of business solely on her actions. Very sad for a dentist who works so hard to have an office girl ruin his reputation.< /review>< resp>

<Review>Quick words to describe Mira Mesa Dental: Accommodating, Caring, Friendly. Let's start with the office, modern amenities. I mean cmon now they have a complimentary massage chair! They've got a keurig, they have magazines galore, your friends are going to want to take you to the dentist just so they can hang out in the lobby. While the dentists are drillin' the waiting room is Netflix and chillin' on the big screen. Located on the second floor so you can check yourself out in the elevator mirrors or if you're in then new year new me hype you can take the stairs for a quick workout. Next, the front desk, they always check insurance and verify your coverage. They send reminders. (They actually call you back when you leave a message, believe it!) Text message reminder? Check. Don't have a cell phone cause big brother is watching? They'll send you a postcard! I routinely get my cleanings from Dr. Martinez. She is passionate about her profession and it reflects in her care for your dental health. I recently had to get my crown replaced by Dr. Faris. I had an accident with a starburst that resulted in a cracked crown. As you can imagine the sensitivity was unbearable. Mira Mesa Dental was able to squeeze me in for an assessment and a temporary same day! This team rocks, I cannot recommend a better place for all your dental needs.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Went in to have a crown rechecked as after 2 months I still couldn't chew on that side or drink hot or cold liquids. Before Dr buffington even looked in my mouth he said I'm "just a junkie looking for pain pills" and there's nothing wrong with his work. When he finally did look at the crown he said "it's infected you need antibiotics" and I was quickly and rudely shown the door. This would have been my third adjustment needed for this crown and 6 months of ongoing pain with a severe weight loss because I can't eat. I hope my costly and painful experience will save others from going to him< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1568921582612, 'text': 'Hi Kaitlyn,\nI am sorry for that past experience that you have had here.\nI am the new owner of Mira Mesa Dental & Ortho, I apologize for what you have experienced here before.\nplease give us a call at your convenience ask to speak to the owner so that we can discuss it more.\nBest regards.\nDr. Faris'}< /response>< gmapID>

<text>Sinister Diesel does an excellent job at both providing extremely high quality diesel parts and ensuring customer service is their top priority. Their service team is incredibly fast to respond to questions/concerns. When you buy from this company you can rest assured that you are going to receive high quality parts while supporting American business, and I will be a returning customer without question.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP18no8str5P9I06cngIPKEPV2OpiZYsaM03e-5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

Awesome products! I purchased a coolant filtration kit for a 2003 f350 6.0 and a bunch of random stuff to go with it. I was amazed at the stuff that filter collected. The product packaging was very impressive as well. Will definitely be buying more goodies in the future!!< /Text>

Sinister Diesel is the place for do it yourselfers. I have ordered most of my parts from them and have always had a pleasurable experience. In fact I plan to order much more in the future. They always have their "Sinister Diesel" brand parts on sale which is a nice touch and the parts come in a timely manner. I would recommend sinister diesel to any one who wants to do it themselves and save on quality parts.<//review>

Great parts. My EGR cooler and blue spring kit are holding up great. Recently ordered some more items and look forward to completing my build with Sinister. I had a bad run in with customer service recently but all around they have been good to me.<//review>

I purchased the master solutions kit with the edge evolution cs2 tuner and a charge pipe kit from sinister diesel. Had a few issues and contacted the customer service dept. They were amazing and extremely helpful and professional. Still waiting on my charge pipes but that's fine because they are hand made and quality is worth the wait. Would definitely recommend them to anybody.<//Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Very easy ordering process, very well designed website and a good selection of aftermarket parts. The only issue I had is the exhaust I ordered is a month and a half out on backorder. You know the availability is not the fault of sinister Diesel, however, never during the order process did it warn me there was a back order nor are there any statuses about availability with any products. Would have been good to know in advance if what I was ordering was actually there. The other half of my order was set to ship 5 days ago but I have not received a tracking number or confirmation of shipment.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I took my truck into the Ford dealership to get my truck looked at. I was told it would cost me $5,000+ for them to do injectors and pump on my truck. Sinister Diesel had a deal on injectors and a pump. All the parts I received are packed excellent and of high quality. They saved me a lot of money in parts doing it myself. I placed an order and paid for the return postage for the core on the injectors when I placed my order. I didn’t notice at the time but the system charged me postage for each injector. I placed the order on a Friday night and Monday morning I received a phone call from Sinister Diesel explaining the problem and letting me know that the money for the extra postage would be returned to my card right away. They easily could not have done anything and waited to see if I would call and say something. That to me shows that they care about the customer and will take care of them. I will go with them anytime I can and would recommend them to everyone!<//review>< pictures>

<review>They sold me BD injectors which 1 failed within 7000 miles. The advertisement did not state they were remanufactured. When I asked for my money back they told me I should have known they were remanufactured. Becareful what you buy. Their listings are disingenuous.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Love the blue color and the wide selection of tailored products.  Haven't installed my cone filter yet but it arrived quickly enough and I did get shipping and order confirmation emails.  Timing was a bit slow bit nothing major.  Looking forward to getting the parts in...but I have to get my Excursion back from the mechanic first 🤣</text>< Pictures>

The price is awesome and the overall look is pretty cool blue spring kit for anyone wanting a little more out of your 6.0 powerstroke I would highly recommend these to excellent up grades from the guys at Sinister diesel.  Well priced, high quality materials, professional work, simple to install, that screams BLUE <3.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The directions were some of the best I've ever used with very clear color pictures on the thick paper so if oil or coolant got on them you could just wipe it off. The only issue I had was that quite a few items were missing from the kit, all the hose clamps, 2 bolts for the filter housing block and a hose retaining clamp. Luckily I have a shop and had all these things anyway but just make sure to check before you install this!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Bought two fuel caps for my new truck. Really liked the looks of the Sinister ones. Shipping and communication was great especially since everything is going a little unpredictable with Covid. Once I unboxed one of them and put it on I was very satisfied. Hopefully they make a DEF replacement for the 2020 Rams soon, will definitely purchase that as well.</Review>

Always have great selection of a variety of product to choose from. If you need to contact Sinister Diesel their sales staff is very knowledgeable, respectful & professional. I've made several purchases from Sinister because of their accessibility, professionalism & all around great pricing.</review></record>

I called Sinister to get the "O" Ring size for a commonly known failure part in the their 6.7 Cummins EGR Delete Kit.  I was told that the "EPA" took all of their "manuals and knowledge".  What a joke, they couldn't even tell me the size of the O Ring that I needed to purchase for their product that failed.  Disappointed.< /Review>

Recently purchased the intake elbow for my 06 dodge 2500 5.9L, easy install and can tell a difference in throttle response. Only thing that set me back on the install was that I received one intake gasket instead of two, thank god I didn’t rip any of the stock ones. Other than that it’s a great product and would highly recommend purchasing it.</Text>

<Text>Ordered a cold air intake for a 2019 F350 6.7 and fits perfectly. Beautiful color on the piping. After I received my cold air intake and installed then I received an e-mail saying if you ordered a cold air intake you get a cleaning kit for free. I called the customer service and they were willing to send me one for free since it was the very next week after I ordered mine. . Highly recommend. .

I looked everywhere for shocks that wouldn’t break the bank to put on my 2017 Cummins with a 6” lift. Purchased a pair of Bilstein shocks and they were delivered quickly. Even called customer service to get an update, and the young woman was very courteous and helpful.<//text>

Was on the fence about buying a bypass oil kit, but with 10% off the other weekend, I decided to pull the trigger. Sinister products might get a bad rap based on the past (never on quality), but I’ve had nothing but good experiences with them. The bypass oil and coolant filter kit is of excellent quality and a very clean setup. The blue aluminum looks great and the mount keeps everything clean.< /text>

I later found that one of the items ordered was still going through manufacturing, and that was all okay. The only problem was that I wasn’t informed so until I called to figure out what was going on with the other part of my order.

Would be 0 if possible. Wont support their products, and customer service is a joke. Talk down on you for owning an "illegal"  product, they JUST sold you 10 months ago. All I needed was a replacement O ring, would not even provide the size of O ring. Also, tried to up sell to another product, without providing any relief that the product I just bought is now illegal. Will not be in business long.</text>

<Review>I received my product fairly quick. But I received the wrong mounting bracket. Customer Service wasn’t the best in sending me the right bracket. It took me over a week for them to approve it to send the new bracket. I called several times and they kept saying the representative that’s working on that is out but I’ll call you tomorrow when I find something out. Never got a call and had to call back. They finally shipped the new bracket and expedited it so I’m happy about that. But I just thought it could have been done quicker. I never got an email back from my first message about getting a new bracket sent to me.< /Review><Rating>3<//Rating>< username>

<Text>Outstanding service and quality! I ordered an injector driver module for my 7.3, it came with extremely detailed instructions as well as a form telling you how to test your electronics/harness for faults before installing so you don't risk damaging your new product! Did the testing and installed and she runs like a dream! Will only shop Sinister Diesel for all of my diesel needs!< /Text>< Pics>

Sinister Diesel never disappoints, I own a 2004 excursion with the early 6.0 and I have invested in the oil and coolant bypass filters as well as the blue spring upgrade with the billet housing and the billet oil filter cap and oil fill cap, all working like a charm and no dislikes about any of it, delivered on time as well.< /text>

<text>Steering box support made a huge difference in our Dodge 3500. The float you would feel when we went over bumps is so much better with this on. Highly recommend this steering stabilizer.</text>< Pictures>

They make a really solid product. I bought the blue spring fuel pressure regulator kit with billet cover from them for my 6.0. Works flawlessly and the billet cover looks great under the hood. I will be going back to them for a few more things over the next couple months. I have many friends running all kinds of different sinister parts on there diesels and I haven't heard one bad thing. Would highly recommend them< /Text>

Sinister Diesel had everything I needed in a one stop shop.   Website was easy to use and finding what I wanted was a breeze.  When the 5" stainless steel system came in,  it arrived in good condition and all parts were there. Assembly was flawless and the sound it produced is amazing.<//Review>

This was my third order from Sinister. This purchase was for a 5" Turbo back exhaust system for my 2006 Ram 2500. Perfect fit and finish. System doesn't have instructions but if you can't figure it out you probably shouldn't be working on your truck in the first place. Shipping and customer service has always been first rate from Sinister.< /Review>

Ordered the cold air intake for my 2018 F-250 6.7L Turbo Diesel. It was delivered in just a few days, installed in under 30 mins, and it looks and performs great! Gives my truck a nice deeper sound and you can really hear the turbo whistling during acceleration and decelerations. Great product and service!< /text>

Sinister Diesel always seems to have the parts I need and want for my truck. A good buddy of mine turned me on to them and it’s been great ever since. I have a few different parts from them on my truck. Everything is great. Wish I had found out about them years ago!</review>

Never really shopped with Sinister Diesel but I don’t have any complaints from my past two purchases. Shipping has been fairly fast and the products I received were OEM and they were cheaper than most other online sites.</Text>

<text>By far the best customer service, also fastest shipping in hard times with covid going on. Definitely would recommend this company for any diesel supporters. I have a 07 powerstroke and will definitely be buying all my parts from sinister, also have a 99 5.4 f250 that will be getting an upgrade to a 7.3 so more parts will be purchased for that as well.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The service and shipping were great and the parts looked excellent. I had an issue with fitment on the turbo up pipes I bought for my 6.0 power stroke, but I was able to get them installed after some fighting.< /Review>

I ordered an exhaust system from Sinister Diesel, I got an order confirmation e-mail from them right away. I heard nothing further for a week, I was expecting to get a shipping confirmation e-mail within seven days. It was an in stock item, their site mentioned nothing about back order. So I called them, they told me that they sent me an email saying that my exhaust would ship in one or two weeks. I never got that e-mail, but I was fine with a week or two. I heard nothing for three weeks, so I called again. Then they said the soonest it could ship would be in another three to five weeks. I just wanted to buy what seemed to be a high quality exhaust system. I wanted to give them my money for a product, they ended up keeping my money for three weeks and I got no exhaust. I just wish they had been honest from the beginning, honesty goes a long way. They wasted my time.<//Review>

The quality and the details in this product are extremely impressive, I ordered 4“ to 6” chrome exhaust tips and they blew me away on the craftsmanship and there definitely not made cheaply there strong and I believe they’ll be on the truck for a very long time, i would highly recommend sinister diesel to anyone<//Review>

I love the sinister diesel cold air intake that I bought.  But when I chatted online with tech which was helpful come to find out that it is an oiled air filter.  The oiled air filter is fine but I spent $399 on the intake which comes with the filter but after spending that much for for that setup one would think that they would give you the oil for the air filter.<//review>

Ordered parts for a 2009 Cummins through sinister just a couple weeks ago. After having parts from a competitor on another diesel truck we own, I wanted to try some of theirs. Difference in quality isn't even close. Very high quality, well made parts. Shipped the day after I ordered and arrived at my door in 5 days. I will be using Sinister again in the future.<//Text>

Great service, from the parts to the time they get to you in. I had worked with a few other diesel part dealers, wasn’t real impressed, but Sinister diesel was definitely different I was all around very pleased. Prices to shipping to returns, well rounded. Had to return a gasket kit, wanted to keep the head studs, they were more than happy to help!</Text>

<Review>What I was looking for was easy to find and the info spot on. Shipping was fast and on time even thought two items shipped differently, not sure why. Parts fit perfect and instructions where included, and I plan on buying more from them.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Fast shipping and amazing company, exhaust looks great, and was very easy to install (Took maybe 45 minutes including cutting the first piece to correct size). Does not change the sound much, but it’s also just a DPF back exhaust. Piece that connects to the DPF has to be cut according to your truck model.</Text>< pics>

Quality parts, and great customer service. I purchased an oil bypass kit for my 6.0 about 2 years ago. I ended up blowing one of the lines to my oil fill cap and called that day to see if they could get me a new one. They stand behind their parts and overnighted me two lines instead of just the one that blew. That kind of customer service is not often found anymore and I can attest to that. I do not shop anywhere else for my diesel needs.</text>

<text>I have a 2016 GMC Denali HD. I ordered the CAT fuel filter replacement kit. The screws did not have clearance from the engine to install the kit. I called the tech support and was just told that they’ve never heard of the screws not working. The follow up email was somewhat insulting saying there are two sets of screws. Use the one that works. Not impressed with their customer service at all.<//text><name>Jethro M< /name><rate>1< /rate><userid>104147657726343274363< /userid><GmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8<//GmapID>< pics>

Bought the EGR delete for my F350. Super reasonably priced with very quick shipping. Very high quality and everything in the kit fit perfectly. Will definitely be buying more goodies from Sinister.< /text>

<Text>I appreciate the prompt delivery and completion of my order. I needed the specific piece right then and there. But I find it hard to believe that shipping costs 30-40$ on a 9$ part that you could fit in an envelope. The majority of the box was packaging material. I didnt even get a sticker in there...</Text><name>Dylan Tinsley<//name></record>

<review>Had been on other sites trying to get a grille for my hubby F350 super duty truck for a Christmas present they were either too big or too tall. Sinister had me to send a picture of the number inside the door, they told me I needed a modified grille, I ordered it and it fit perfectly. It arrived in time for Christmas and my hubby is happy as can be. Thanks guys you made his Christmas special.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I have a small mechanic shop in Southeast Texas, in my opinion Sinister has put together a perfect kit for fixing the 6.0l powerstroke. The products in the kit are top quality in the industry, and has everything you need for the job. Thank E</Review>

<Text>Ordered sinister diesel 4” turbo back exhaust for my 2001 Ford F-250 7.3L! Package showed up 2 days after ordering before scheduled time! All parts where packaged nice and neat and in great shape! System installed in about 2 hour with no modification to anything all hanger fit into place as if factory! Started truck up and WOW! What a difference in sound. No need for straight pipe that comes with kit! Muffler has a nice low rumble at idle then wakes right up when you put your foot into it! Plus the really nice part not so loud it rattle your ear drums while cruising down freeway at 80 mph! All in all great experience with SINISTER DIESEL! Will be using them again and again got more items in shopping cart now it’s just trying to get wife onboard to spend the money bahahahahaha!<//Text>< rating>

<Text>I have a very blue 6.0 Excursion thanks to Sinister Diesel! I have been impressed by all the parts I have. My latest purchase is a Bulldog Series 2 Turbo. I definitely feel a difference in my mid range power! It would have been nice to have some directions, but the install was straight forward enough.</Text>< Pictures>

Excellent pricing, great products, easy to navigate site and fairly quick shipping given the current circumstances we are living in right now. When you need your truck to be on point with looks and functionality there's only one place I look to and thats sinisterdiesel.com. The only downfall I see is that there seems to be less choices for custom sinster diesel parts for LB7 Dmax<//text>

Love the look and the sound of the cold air intake on my LML. Sounds like a jet on a cold Michigan morning when warming up. Would have been 5 stars but dang. You spend that much $ and ya don’t even get a sticker in the box!</text>

I'm not putting down Bullet proof Diesel products , but I think that those guys are over priced .That is why I give Sinister Diesel a 5 star rating , as I am a very satisfied customer . The only thing that I wish , is that they would send the buyer some Decals ( Sinister Diesel ) with your order , that's my only disappointment , ( I like Decals ) that show , and advertise who and what I am putting in my Truck . I would recommend these guys to an enemy , and that's saying ALOT . Thank You guys for your service and your performance parts that you offer . Sincerely Mr. Pat Paterson           Satisfied Customer and will be buying all of my parts from them .             A-1 in my BOOK .</Review>< Pictures>

These guys are great. My orders always come in a couple days, and they are always quick to help. They respond to my e-mail questions at all hours of the night. Great service and prices, and some pretty cool parts they make themselves. I will definitely be getting more gear from them!</Review>

I ordered an intercooler pipe for my 6.0 powerstroke and the original eta was 2 weeks out. I emailed them and told them I had to stay under 10 psi boost and they shipped it quicker because I needed it desperately.</Review>

Called after I placed an order to have the finish changed on a part I ordered. They were upfront about possible time delays due to the change and corrected the order right then and there for me. Item shipped out 2 days later and had no issues.</text>

Hands down the best diesel truck parts! I’ll never buy diesel parts elsewhere. Super fast shipping, no damaged shipping boxes and the parts are exactly what I needed. Sure beats going to the local Ford house! Thank you Sinister Diesel for your awesome diesel truck parts and upgrades and stellar customer service!< /review>

<text>Every product i’ve got from sinister has been exact fit as oem, just as durable, and has far outlasted any of the other “just as oem” products. My orders have always been processed and shipped, even through the covid-19 pandemic, in a very timely manner. I’ve always had great responses with great help when asking questions about the product or simply what i need. Great company with great products, that will continue to have my business for the years to come.< /text>< UserId.>

Great company. From the user friendly website, high quality parts, constant offers, and points system for account holders. One of the best ways you know attention to detail is a must every box is labeled with who assembled and inspected the product. You can’t go wrong with Sinister Diesel.<//text>

I ordered an exhaust system from Sinister Diesel two weeks ago it was my first time ordering from them. After ordering I seen I had an issue so I thought, so I emailed them I got a quick response from them I was amazed at the customer service that I received. I was so impressed that within the same week I actually placed my second order with them a cold intake, I was gonna order it from somewhere else but because of the customer service I received it made me order from SD. Yup, my hubby is lucky he gets Father’s Day and our wedding Anniversary all in the same week! I will definitely be ordering again! I definitely give them ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /text>

<Review>Best quality EGR Cooler, Oil Cooler, and Coolant Filter kit. My truck runs like new and Sinister Diesel helped me get exactly what I needed. Top notch customer service and the highest quality parts available.

Will only shop at Sinister Diesel for my parts for now on.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8</Gmap_id>< Name>

It's been a pleasure doing business with sinister, Julien at sales was knowledgeable and respectful. He was willing to work with me in a pinch, got the part to me in a hurry. The affirm payment option for a seperate purchase was great option and I'm quite happy to have made that deal. I cant wait to get my new alternator and cold air intake installed! Thank you sinister for being awesome!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I had to replace Intercooler pipes, and I am by no means a mechanic. Sinister had great reviews so I ordered new pipes. They had videos to help me, not that it is a hard project but it helped. I had also called to ask questions about other upgrades, my experience was great from how quickly the parts shipped to the customer service over the phone to the quality and look. I will definitely continue to do business with sinister diesel.< /Review>

My 2nd high quality part from Sinister.  Shipping has been a tick slow but I am happy to wait a bit for super parts.  I just wish they offered everything in the grey color option.  The Blue is I little loud for my taste.<//text>

Ordered multiple parts from Sinister Diesel for my truck. Everything is always on time and their customer service is always helpful and willing to answer any and all questions, no matter how many. Never have to worry whether or not all the parts will be there when it arrives. Only downside is the pricing, some stuff seems a bit overpriced, like you’re paying for the name sometimes (especially on smaller items). As for the big stuff, the pricing is fair and the quality of the parts will never disappoint. I will be ordering from Sinister for as long as I have a diesel!</Review>

I ordered a part for my husband for Father's Day. It wasn't until after I placed the order that I realized I added something on he didn't need. I emailed them immediately and they fixed it for me quickly and with no hassle. It arrived on time and the hubby was happy with the quality.<//Review>

Quality parts! Way better over OEM. Great customer service. Not to many places now will just answer some questions for you & go right to the back to confirm something is in stock. If I need anything else & Sinister offers it, I will be getting it from them.</text>

<Text>Awesome product! I ordered the blue spring upgrade for my 6.0 powerstroke. You can tell its a quality product from the moment you open the package and it looks great on the truck! It was very easy to install and came through with quality you can depend on. As soon as I started my truck I noticed the difference in idle quality and power. When driving I noticed the turbo spools quicker too. This product is a must have to protect your injectors with the higher fuel pressure.< /Text><response>None< /response>< rating>

<text>Purchased injectors, a lift pump and a sump kit for my 01 dodge 2500. Everything came on time and showed up in good condition.  Didnt receive a tracking number for the injectors because they shipped straight from dynamite diesel. But sinister sent me tracking info with no issues. Will consider them in my future diesel parts purchases.<//text></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Ordered a fuel pressure regulator from sinister. I was very happy with the product it looked good and worked good. the only complaint I had was with the style of cover that came with the regulator was shaped differently from my stock cover and they should have an option for an extension on your fuel pressure sensor because of this I had to get an adapter at the local auto parts store but all in all everything turned out good.< /Review>

Have been installing these parts for some time as a mechanic. Now I own a diesel, I can reap the benefits. Sinister is well made, high quality and the extra money it costs is well worth keeping the USA in business.</Text>

Quality is great and very reliable.  I Work at ford truck shop and we use Sinister diesel products frequently to upgrade the factory parts that frequently fail and have no complaints on reliability. I use sinister diesel products on my own personal truck and have had no issues recommend using there parts to everyone and anyone looking to repair or upgrade the trucks.< /Text>

First time ordering stuff from them. My parts were on backorder. Well i was moving and needed to give them my business address to make sure id get them. Their customer was spot on and polite. I was actually mind blown how professional they were. After they emailed me to confirm they switched to the right address and i got them no issues. Their signature finish in the parts is actually mind blowing. Its sexy as hell.< /Text>

<text>I ordered the blue spring upgrade for my 6.0 powerstroke. You can tell its a quality product from the moment you open the package and it looks great on the truck! It was very easy to install and came through with quality you can depend on. As soon as I started my truck I noticed the difference in idle quality and power. When driving I noticed the turbo spools quicker too. This product is a must have to protect your injectors with the higher fuel pressure.</text><user_id>108385921836997032213< /user_id><response>None</response>< name>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Just installed the Sinister Diesel Coolant Filtration System on my 2003 Dodge 3500. Great package with everything I needed for the installation. Instructions, packaging and parts are all professionally done. Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to run a coolant filtration system on their vehicle. I also ordered 2 extra filters so I can do the recommend initial filter changes for the system. Lastly, working with Sinister Diesel to get a bypass oil filter system for the 2003-04 5.9l dodge. They have helped me out and hopefully keep coming out with more products.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Only thing I can knock is the instructions were kinda lacking. Just a detailed pic of where each pipe and hanger goes would be nice. Luckily there are videos on YouTube installing this exhaust so not too hard to figure it out. Oh and you think they would include one sticker, but nah. Oh well.</review>< Date>

So far so good.  First time ordering and although the delivery was delayed,  they called me personally to let me know.   I appreciated the personal call vs an email or no notice at all like most companies.   Intake system  was well packaged and looks awesome.<//Text>

First and last time I will ever deal with sinister diesel. I called to get information on parts I was wanting to order was told they were in stock and would ship out . 3 days later I called back because parts had not shipped I was told oh parts with people that do are powder coating it should ship Monday which is  5 days away. So they did upgrade me to second delivery. Now Wednesday still no email confirmation of order being shipped so I called back again. I was told this time  they did not have the part it was back ordered and would be at least a week or two before it shipped. At this point I asked for a full refund and was told the refund would be issued that day.  I called back 3 days later just to make sure refund had been done not seeing anything with the bank. I was told no the refund had not been done yet , I was then told they would issue refund that day again.  5 hrs later I get an email confirmation of refund and two days later today I finally have my refund.  I see sinister as a joke. If you don’t have the parts just say so up front don’t lie to your customers and play games.
I went to Banks ordered my parts no problems and had them two days ago .< /Text>

<Review>Recently ordered new up pipes and a down pipe for my 6.4 powerstroke which is my main work truck. Had a short window to do the work and i give kudos to Sinister Diesel  for making it happen. Being a pipefitter/rig welder type person for over 30 yrs other people's work gets picked at pretty hard and i have to say it was beautiful work and couldn't ask for a better fit on the flanges. Great job y'all and Thank you</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I recently picked up a powerstroke. Sinister deseil has a lot of popularity in powerstroke searches. I started to look at their products yes prices are high but look at the quality. The welds are beautiful the material is top notch. That blue isn't to bad either lol. I decided to go with a blue spring upgrade with their billet housing. So during installation one of my threads stripped on my powerstroke. The housing is so well built  by sinister diesel it doesn't leak and or matter. I plan to get it fixed but its a oat to quality. However decide for yourself.<//text>

Have ordered twice from Sinister. Products arrive in a reasonable amount of time and items were well packaged. I had an issue with a small piece out of my blue spring kit. Customer service took care of me without hassle and sent a replacement quickly. I think the products look great and I have had nothing but positive experience with customer service. Would recommend to friends.<//text>

<Review>Every time I need something for my 6.0 I always turn to Sinister first. I have almost every product available from turbo to caps and EVERY part is awesome. the craftsmanship is over the top. I see alot of people on pages bashing Sinister due to a bad experience and price. Well cheaper is usually never better and every manufacturer out there has bad apples. You pay for what you get and here you get quality!!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I bought a outletpipe for my intercooler and It came without the hardware. I called and without any problems they mailed the hardware out. Issues happen, we can’t prevent them all, it’s how the issues are handled when they arise. Great job guys!</text>

Good product, pipe sounds nice on my truck. Installation instructions were lacking details and illustrations, so you need to just figure it out yourself or pay to have it installed. No extras, not even a sticker.< /Text>

Great fast customer service. I ordered an intake and a shirt. They forgot to send the shirt and that day they sent one out immediately with some free goodies inside. I don’t rate a company on their mistakes but I rate them on how they correct them. So I give them a 5star rating.</review>

<review>Poor online explanation of items added with your purchase, such as the ultra torque lube, they state "do you want to add ultra torque to your order for $9.99" i said yes, but when it showed up it was just a little 1oz tube not the 10oz bottle I expected like other performance part companies add, when you buy a arp head stud kit don't waist $9.99 for something that comes included already with every arp head stud kit.  What a rip off! Never going thru sinister again and stay away from the blue devil!  But hey they send ya another 1oz bottle. What a joke!<//review>< gmapID>

I bought a Redhead steering gear for my 2008 Ram 2500 had it installed and love it. A little tight but expected it I know it will loosen in time. Sent the core back to Redhead, and hoping I get the core charge back as fast as they shipped it to me.</text>

The parts I received were exactly what I ordered and delivered on time.  I would only ask that the instructions were a little more detailed in where certain hangers went on the exhaust system.  With that I will definitely buy from them again!!!</Review>

When another vendor who sells Sinisters parts, took my money and ran. I reached out to one of the sales reps Eric. Eric went well and beyond what customer service, he set bar. And had my parts out the next day. You've certainly  got a happy customer for life!! 🤘</review>

<review>Ordered the 6.4 Powerstroke coolant filtration system. System components exceeded my expectations for quality. Unfortunately my Amp Reshearch retractable steps interfered with the filter. Called Sinister Diesel and ordered longer hoses and move the filter farther back from original mounting point. System works great and I will order more parts from Sinister Diesel.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Pretty easy to find what you need on the site. I had an issue with the heads up kit I ordered because the head studs that came with it were supposedly on back order. I called them to rectify it, took a couple phone tags but we got it done, and they quickly and efficiently got what I needed on the way and without any pain so cudoes to sinister diesel. Y’all are so doing a fine job!!!< /text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><time>1573482485569</time><review>I purchased an exhaust system for my 2001 F350 crew cab long bed. The ad said it would fit any configuration truck up to 172 inch wheelbase and was a direct bolt in. For some reason the system is about 6 inch too short so I had to cut a chunk from the muffler delete pipe. only one of the hangars matched up with my Factory exhaust hanger points. The directions are mediocre-at-best telling you how to install it. For some who may have installed systems before it might be better. I was very disappointed that I still had to have professional work done to complete the system. I also think it would be nice if they would offer an exhaust system for trucks with a lift on it due to the fact that the piece that goes over the rear axle would not need to be bent at all. Quality of the product was decent for the price the welds did not look too bad but the clamps are pretty cheap. It's possible on the more expensive kits may be everything would have been better.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< user_name>

The plan was to attach a CAT high efficiency fuel filter. Well, the adapter threads were wrong. So, I decided to order it from Sinister Diesel. When I received it, I compared it to the other adapter. Sinister Diesel has a great product! It’s large and very durable. It was very easy to install and looks great!! Thank you all for a great product!! His is my second purchase from you all. Both products are fantastic!!

I ordered their 5 inch exhaust for my 2006 dodge 2500. Their price for a stainless exhaust is definitely hard to beat. My only issue so far is that the exhaust is back ordered for 6-8 weeks. I just hope the wait is worth it.</review>

< Review>
I have purchased the Blue Spring Kit & the Coolant Bypass System for my Ford. Ordering was easy. The coolant system arrived as promised, easy to understand directions. The Blue Spring became back ordered 10 days. I received an email informing me of the delay.

When I called customer service, Sean was very apologetic. He offered to help locate a shop that had it, if I needed before their delivery date.

The equipment was high quality machined & everything fit perfectly! The Blue Kit delivers the added fuel psi & the throttle response is great! The coolant system is also high quality parts & gives me the confidence that the Wix filter is keeping my engine free of contaminates.

I have friends who have purchased other items with great outcomes as well! Superb quality parts & great customer service equals a happy customer!<//Review>

I have purchased twice from Sinister Diesel. The staff doesnt just sell you parts they use their knowledge to guide you on how to build your vehicle up. They also have a great paying feature using Afirm. It allows convienant low monthly payments.< /text>

I had purchased a EGR cooler for my 2006 f450 6.0 and its great. Great quality products. Fast shipping to Hawaii. Will definitely purchase more items from Sinister Diesel. Next I will buy the coolant filtration kit.< /review>

I have had multiple orders with Sinister Diesel. I appreciate the staff for always taking the time to answer my questions and giving me helpful advice on my 2007 Ford F250 Super Duty Powerstroke 6.0L. I currently have orders on there way and cant wait to install the parts on my truck. Great job!< /Review>

Great company providing great products. I ordered a part and chose overnight shipping only to get a phone call from their office to tell me they are in the same town as I am. I picked up my part locally and was refunded my shipping costs. I will buy from them again!!< /review>

Had a slight issue with my order after package was delivered. Being a time difference I elected to email instead of call. Got a response and a fix the same day. Products are great and customer service is even better. Will be a repeat customer, I mean I do own a 6.0 lol.</Review>

They said it couldn't be done

Actually putting the Sinister oil bypass kit on a ram 6.7 with dual radiators it's pretty simple. All it took was putting a shim under the third bolt position and tipping the filter down far enough so that it didn't distort the hoses going to the radiator it works fine but it would be a lot better if they add two or three inches to the discharge line because I could have tipped it more and still had room to get the canister on from the bottom except I was starting to stretch the discharge line like a guitar string so I had to tip it back up thus somewhat distorting the radiator hoses.

I didn't really care what it was going to take to put the kit in ... it was going to go in because I don't really want to run soot though my bearings and as it turned out it was very simple to do .

So hopefully they'll figure out that all they have to do is lower the point of contact with the hoses and extend the discharge line to make it just as easy to put on a dual radiator system as a standard radiator system<//text>

Products look well made.  Instructions/inventory didn't exactly match the   product I bought,  luckily I did my research and know what I need to do.  Communication was poor.  The product was on backorder and I didn't know until I called to check on why it hadnt shipped a week after the order was placed.< /Text>

We were very happy that Sinister Diesel had a 4-6 inch drop pitman arm. Not many companies had this in stock. My husband builds custom trucks and Sinister will be our go-to from here on out. We would like to see faster shipping, but all in all very good quality and easy to use website!<//review>

<review>I've purchased the sinister coolant filtration system with oil filter bypass, blue spring kit with adjustable fuel pressure, billet fuel filter cap for running a fuel pressure guage, and a blue spring kit and thermostat housing for my brother. All for 6.0s. The quality of the parts and the speed at which we received them have been absolutely top notch. The fit is perfect, the finish is flawless, and the instructions that come with it are great. I will continue to use Sinister as I work my way through the bulletproofing process on my truck.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /gmap_id></record>

I have bought multiple items from sinister, egr delete, oil cooler, gasket kit, coolant filtration, 4” exhaust, new grill, all were delivered quickly, only had one problem with the oil cooler which was next day flown to me and installed. Great Customer service system, lady sounded hot on the phone dunno maybe she was. I’ll keep ordering for sure.< /review>

<Review>Sinister diesel service...I have been a diesel owner for years and ordered hundreds of parts from companies. I recently purchased the HSP Y bridge from sinister. There prices are great but there customer service is outstanding. I never waited to speak with a representative they were always polite, professional and knew about the product they sold. Best diesel company out there and will definitely use sinister in the future< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8</gmapID></record>

I ordered a fuel pressure regulator through sinister diesel. The product works great and really helped with the trucks performance. Delivery was fast and very well packaged with installer friendly instruction.< /text>

After installing 3 rebuilt alternators, best one lasted 5 months. I ordered a 200 amp from Sinister Diesel and was pleasantly surprised .  Quality product;  Great looks;  Solid 14 volt output.  Time will tell.< /Text>

I purchased an SCT live wire, AFE intake and blue spring fuel upgrade kit for my 6.0 and I couldn’t be happier. The day after the parts were installed, I drove to the truck for 12 hours in 2 days and towed 10k pounds for 4 of it and everything performed flawlessly!<//Review>

<review>Was looking for some parts for my 2000 f350 powerstroke and wanted something quick. Ordered up my parts and had them at my house in about 48 hours. Website was super easy to navigate and check out was a breeze. Made me not hate my life shopping online that day. Thanks sinister I’ll be buying more I am sure.</review><username>keith pratt</username>< Gmap_id>

I ordered parts for my 6.7 liter Cummings an received the parts in a timely manner.  When I called about a missing Banks Intake System they were able to track it down to the manufacturer.  Good communication skills and customer service.<//review>

<Review>The best aftermarket company to deal with for all your Duramax & Powerstroke needs. Only saying these two because I own both platforms and have been using Sinister for a while now. They have me as a repeat customer for life. Friendly employees to deal with, reasonable prices and decent shipping.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Sinister Diesel is top shelf for sure. They even sent the exact star but to take off the electrical and the stainless nuts for the cold air intake. I emailed them and got a phone call in less than 5 minutes. Will continue to order from them as long as I own a diesel.< /review>< Pics>

Ordered the Cat fuel filter adapter kit for duramax, only dislike is the removal of the water in fuel sensor, other than that the product was clean, had a made and inspected by card, and has worked very well thus far. Product will pay for itself in the long run. Better filter for 45 dollars cheaper and the adapter looks great</Text>

Top notch diesel performance parts and accessories! The quality of parts we’ve purchased and installed have greatly exceeded my expectation! Wow!
Scott Maranda in sales has taken care of us, making sure the correct parts are ordered for my Excursion! Yet again Sinister exceeded my expectations of what customer service should be!

Great product. I ordered the cold air intake for my 6.7 powerstroke. Really happy with the results and the way it fits. Quality parts, clamps, boots. However, reason for being a 4 and not a 5 is this, mine shipped about a week after I ordered it and when I received it, there were no instructions for installation anywhere. Luckily, I know what I’m doing a bit but there was nothing to reference at all. Other than that, I’m really happy with it.<//Text>

<Text>Shipping time was pretty fast for vehicle parts(4 business days). Parts were of great quality for my 6.4 work truck. Fixed a broken part, cost 5$ more than the OEM replacement piece and looks better too. The instruction needed a tiny bit more detail but anyone who is slightly mechanically inclined should be able to figure it out.<//Text><user>114574347292721461709<//user><name>Brandon Jones< /name>< resp>

I have purchased a number of items from Sinister Diesel. The most major purchase I made was a complete solutions package for my 07 6.0 Powerstroke. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive to take this route rather than OEM, but in hindsight I couldn’t be any more pleased. All the parts were of great quality and they have held up great. About a year after replacing the head gaskets and other major parts included with the kit, I had a small problem with the o-ring seals on one standpipe. I contacted Sinister Diesel and their customer service took the care to replace the parts as quickly as they were able. The parts are great, the customer service is great, and the knowledge that these parts are made right in here the USA all help me to feel that I will go through Sinister Diesel for all of my truck’s needs. I couldn’t be any more pleased with the experiences I have had with them so far. They are a little more expensive compared to the knockoff items other companies offer, but in my opinion, it is well worth the extra money.<//Text>

< Review>
The sell great products at a fair price. I have bought items that are cheaper, from elsewhere. I can honestly say “You get what you pay for.” Sinister Diesel sells more expensive products but they fit like an OEM replacement. Will definitely be buying more from them in the future.</Review>

Just installed the cold air intake on 2016 gmc duramax.  Product looks really nice but my check engine has come on twice and had to clear at dealer   While on my mileage is awful. Have tried to contact via email twice and have not received a response.but when the engine light is off products seems to sound and does a great job</Review>

<Review>Ordered the blue spring upgrade, my truck was leaking fuel pretty bad. I love the way this looks! It’s my first mod, so kinda like a first tattoo. My truck just got it’s first tattoo. Looking forward to more Sinister products! And what’s even better, Sinister is American made! Love that blue!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Sinister Diesel provided me with a LLY Race EGR full Delete. It was a quality product at a fair price. The instructions were very easy to follow too. They also included everything I needed for the job and what tools to use also before I tore into and found out I needed something special. The pipe had a slight fitment issue but was easily bent into place and tightened down. They also powder coated the piece Sinister blue so it didn’t only work good but looked good which I find equally important.

I would personally recommend my friends to buy Sinister products the four out of five stars was due to fitment and that it is hard to extremely please me.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE-BLgmgheCZBV9jQgXbuWRX9DKAQ_-O-NdO5T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>After hearing horror stories of cheaply made products my friends have purchased and ultimately regretted from eBay and Amazon, I decided to make sure that I buy quality products. I purchased the caterpillar fuel filter adapter from sinister diesel, and I am completely satisfied. The craftsmanship and quality maching of the product exceeded my expectations %100! I am pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend. Thanks again guys.... A+++</review><time>1551732691183</time>< rate>

<user_name>Ted Gifford< /user_name><Text>Do not use the web chat/email service.  They will not respond to that.  You will need to call, wait up to 10 minutes for a live helpful response to your questions.  If you need mike from the fab shop, wait another 10 minutes after the initial wait.  Have your cell phone fully charged.

All but one of my orders had fast delivery and quality parts.  Either made by sinister diesel or by others.

My only concern is of the weld integrity of their headers.  However, I was reassured after sending pictures and another phone call, that there have been no header cracking or other failures.  That these were full penetration welds and that they have a life time warranty.  We may find out more with this product.  I do not have that comfy feeling on the header quality.  The lack of fillet welds worries me.

Otherwise, no issues yet.  Thanks for the help guys<//Text>< Date>

<UserId.>106216951616783192363</UserId.>< Review>
I purchased a bypass oil filter kit for a 2018 Ram 2500 6.7 Cummins.  Parts seem to be very high quality and the kit installed fairly easily in a couple of hours.  The instructions came with color photos.  When they say “you may” have to move a coolant line to instal the oil line on top of the oil filter .... you do.  So I wouldn’t remove the NPT plug on top of the oil filter housing until all of that coolant drains out.  I also modified the factory bracket that they said needed to be removed for the upper radiator hose so that it could still be used.  All in all I’m impressed with the quality. I did an oil analysis before installation so time will tell in a year when I do another one what the results will be.< /Review>

I like the products, but the sales team could use some work. Not very knowledgeable. I asked about a military discount. They told me they did do one , but had no idea how to apply it. So I received no discount. But like I said good product.<//review>

The only problem I had ordering was waiting on hold for so long, but once I got through to a sales person, the order process went quickly and smoothly.  My order didn't ship out right away, but when it did I received it in the 3 days it was promised.  I do believe that yes the customer service could use some improvement, but seems to me they must be doing a good business if you have to wait so long on the phone to talk to someone.</Review>

I've ordered from these guys a few times, but it's been a few years since my last purchase. I came back to sinister because their customer service, prices, and response times were always good in the past. This time was no different, and I'll continue to use sinister in the future. The quality, fit, and finish are always excellent on their brand parts.< /review>

The most outstanding performance parts on the market the S&D filter system for the 6.0 is better than they give it credit for, the shipping time and tracking was accurate and the customer service is excellent. If you want performance with high quality confidence in your dealer go SINISTER and you’ll never shop elsewhere!!!!!!!!<//review>

Nothing else was done by the previous owner. So I got their kit for the egr delete, oil cooler update, and the coolant relocation. I haven’t installed them yet but they got here in good time, price seems fair for eliminating the issues this motor has.< /review>< pictures>

I paid for second day shipping but I didn’t receive the intake in 2 days and Sinister refunded my monkey for the shipping! Wasn’t their fault it was the suppliers fault. All in all they’re a good company and very user friendly!< /text>

I've purchased several products from Sinister.  On my last order there were some issues that required me to return some products.  Their customer service was outstanding.  They communicate very well in a professional manner and ensured my issue was resolved to my satisfaction.  I will definitely be back.</text>

Sinister Diesel has been a great resource for my F-250  parts.  The staff has always been very helpful with all my questions and any of my returns.

My only suggestion to them is to offer more items in a black or grey. I don't like to be flashy, so the blue is a little much for me.</text>

I ordered the wrong color on an oversized item and they were able to stop the delivery midway and send me the right part right away. It was my mistake but they went above and beyond to make sure I got what I wanted.< /Review>

I purchased the Sinister Diesel Blue Spring Kit with Billet Spring Housing for my  2007 Ford F 250 6.0  Powerstroke.
Quality product at a fair price. Installation was easy and didn't take long at all. This was my first Sinister Diesel purchase for Prohect Plain Jane.  I can guarantee you it won't be my last. Thanks Sinister for the great product and awesome customer service!</Review>

Bought an exhaust and it fit perfectly with no troubles. The only thing I could suggest is a diagram, if I didn’t know any better I could’ve very easily put it together wrong.<//text>

<Review>Sinister Diesel’s IDM module was the fix for a ODB P1670 code on my 2002 Ford Excursion 7.3L (It was a shame to have to tuck this beauty inside where no one will see it). I don’t think you can beat the price or the quality of this product. They sent an excellent trouble-shooting guide to ensure that the problem is getting fixed and the core return was easy. I’ll be using Sinister Diesel for future fixes and upgrades!</Review>< pics>

<text>Very efficient with getting the part delivered. The part discription and specific to my truck was on point. The ficm was plug and play no programming needed. Returning the core was a little confusing had to call customer service and have them send me a link to the UPS return link should be mailed in the box with the item if a core charge is applied to the order. I will use sinister from now on for all diesel parts.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I talked to a parts specialist and they were able to answer all my questions and when they didn't have an answer they transferred me to someone that could could. Fast shipping and the quality of the up pipe and high flow intake pipe were really great quality, well worth the money, I will definitely be doing business again with Sinister Diesel< /text>

I have ordered from Sinister twice. Both times, no problems. Both were web orders, and both shipped quickly (items delivered inside of a week, but I am in CA.). I've never dealt with anyone in person, or on the phone. Maybe they are jerks in person, but I would never know. They've had what I needed, so I'll continue to be a customer until there's a reason not to be.
Being in the retail business myself, I see a lot of these 1 star reviews among a sea 5 star reviews and there is always more to the story than the complainer let's on. Usually the customer is just a pain in the a$$ and will never be happy. Many times the customer is just flat out wrong, but the internet has given every whiner a voice, so there you go. Frequently it is actually the distributor or manufacturer that is the reason parts are delayed. No company is perfect, and sometimes problems occur. That doesn't mean a company is bad or dishonest. You'll just have to give them a shot and find out for yourself. I'm happy with them, if that makes any difference.</review>

The parts work great performance wise,definitely woke my 7.3 up, and very freindly customer service. The only complaints I have is that 1. they had to send my kit separatly parts because they didn’t have them in stock (I’m still waiting on an exhaust ) but they did contact me informing me they would have to do so. 2. Is that  it almost seems like they sent the wrong support for my air intake because it’s about 5 inches shorter than it would need to be to mount to the truck. So this left me having to make a support bracket for the part but after this it worked perfectly.< /text>

I was looking for a kit to bulletproof my 04 Ford 6.0. The online chat person sent me a direct link to all of the parts that I needed to purchase. Pricing was good, parts arrived quickly, I live in N California. Everything was as described and works perfectly. Very Happy.< /text>

I love you Sinister Diesel I've been using them for almost 10 years and their products are far more superior they've put a lot of effort into it especially if your own power strokes they are one of the best or use their parts on my personal trucks and on my work trucks I own a construction company and have a quite a few vehicles and they're blue which for me is awesome my favorite part about them is probably their customer service more in reference to the technical support side and troubleshooting they have no problem talking to you all day long if you need some help working on something I love Sinister Diesel.<//Text>

<Response>None</Response><text>By far the best quality parts on the market. So far i have purchased the Blue Spring kit with Plate, EGR delete, Oil bypass kit, Sinister badging kit, and most recently purchase of the coolant filter kit. All the Sinister products are made to perfection and you can tell are over engineered for long term life and attention to detail in even the packaging of their products.

Every time i call i get a person i can talk to and a friendly voice, and was even offered a military discount once they found out i was a Marine.

GREAT JOB SINISTER TEAM!! Almost done with my Excursion and will be sending you guys pictures!!< /text>< user_id>

<review>Great experience with Sinister Diesel!
I ordered a an AMSOIL By-Pass filter kit for my 2006 Dodge Ram 3500 5.9L Cummins. My oil is as clean as ever. Have not conducted an Oil Analysis yet but plan to soon. This kit is amazing and looks real good under the hood. Only point of concern I had was the vibration and what effects it will eventually have on the filter but, the bracket is welded with quality!
When I did initially received the order it did heave the wrong filter head. It had the coolant filter head instead. I called Sinister Diesel up told them the issue and they mailed the right filter head overnight!
Thank you Sinister diesel!<//review>< Time>

I purchased a CAT coolant filter from Sinister Diesel and it’s been a high quality product and works perfect with their coolant aftermarket upgrade kit, I would suggest buying a Sinister Diesel coolant kit any day of the year I’ve been very happy with the products I’ve purchased.< /review>

<Review>They had the part I needed for $15 cheaper than my Ford dealer could get it for. The part came quick and one YouTube video and an hour later the part was installed without a hitch. I think I saved myself about $300 installing the part myself.  I only wish I had the bucks to purchase some of the cool items for my truck.  I would recommend them to anyone.</Review>< Pics>

I have dealt with this company many times and will continue to do business with them in the future. Everything I have purchased from them not only looked great but it fit exactly the way it was described. The bypass coolant and oil kit I purchased from them looks great and does a great job. Needless to say I recommend them to any body looking for diesel pick up parts.</Text>

2000 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel, needed a new clutch master/slave cylinder. Sinister Diesel had the South Bend HD set up for a good price. Ordered it and received it no problems. Quick and fairly painless installation. Clutch pedal and shifting feels much better now.<//text>

I was very pleased with how easy it is to navigate on the website & I am very pleased with the parts that purchased from sinister diesel but...... I am very disappointed with the fact that I spent over $1000 & didn't even receive a sticker for my truck. $1000 dollars is worth a hat, t-shirt, and sticker in my opinion. How can you advertise for a company without any advertisements?</Text>

<Text>Bought the Sinister headers for my 6.0 diesel. Was told it would be a delay due to the fact they are made to order. Customer service kept me posted by email on its progress. Even sent me a complimentary t-shirt when I inquired about order. Customer service stays on top and is very friendly and professional in handling inquiries. Will definitely do business with again.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>I can't really complain about Sinister Diesel. Their tech support helped get my first gen Cummins back on the road and running better than ever. Shipping was an issue and that I mean my truck was down an extra week but it all worked out. I plan on doing future business with them to keep my first gen happy and their great support</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I have ordered a few things from sinister, intercooler tubes,coolant filtration system, billet caps and this last purchase I ordered icp sensor and pip tale. I say the best quality parts by far. I just got tired of wasting money buy junk from other places that talked there parts up just to find out that it was junk</review>

I bought several parts from sinister diesel. They have always fit and looked great. If I do have a problem the service department is on it. The one problem I had was the adjustable blue spring kit. It didn’t come preset to the pressure it was supposed to be set at. It was very high. I’m glad I had a gauge installed or I could have ruined my injectors. I called the service department and they guided me on how to adjust it properly.</review>

<Time>1554343029518< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I ordered an injection pump for my Duramax after mine went up. I ordered a pump they said they had in stock online and paid extra for overnight shipping. They not only didn’t notify me that the pump I ordered was not actually in stock, but also had the nerve to charge me the extra 55 dollars for a pump they did have in stock, 3 days after I was supposed to receive the first pump. They also stated that they would refund my initial shipping cost since I didn’t get a pump for about a week after the initial order, but that never happened. I also had to get a shipping label sent from them for the core return because they were going to make me pay shipping to send the core back! And I inquired about the shipping cost being refunded to me in the same email chain and have yet to here back from them after 5 days. I will never recommend them or buy from them again. Very disappointed in the customer service, system, and just general business practice. I’m convinced the only reason the pump wasn’t junk is because they didn’t make it!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I ordered my egr delete and air intake from sinister. The intake was back ordered so we emailed them and they instantly replied and told us when it would be shipped and arrival date. They produce great products and have good customer service. They also send free sinister stickers and sometimes shirts with orders which is nice.< /review>

<Review>Great company and great productsI have ordered through Sinister Diesel four times in the past and recently ordered a new air filter and charge pipe kit. I have not installed yet but the kit looks great. Can't wait to get it on. Great service, shipping was good, and customer service was excellent. Everything comes to my door quickly and everything arrived undamaged. Thank you, will be a repeat customer.

In the picture, there were packing peanuts in the box when the charge pipe kit was shipped. When they arrived I took them out.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I have a notorious ford 6.0 and I've bought everything sinister to bulletproof my engine and I definitely made the right decision. Yes it's more pricey than other brands but you also get what you pay for. Best to do it right the first time!<//text>

< Review>
Ordered a Red Head steering gear for my 2001 Dodge 2500, 5.9 Cummins from Sinister Diesel, process was easy, steering gear arrived when and as stated. I had my mechanic install steering gear, pack up core and I shipped it back to Red Head. I received my core refund in two days and was extremely pleased with the ease of doing business with Sinister Diesel. I would certainly recommend them for anyone needing parts for their diesel truck..< /Review>

I  searched the Web and found looking for some parts and found Sinister Diesel.  They had the type of locks I wanted for my truck hitches,  and for the best price.  Not only was their price the lowest, but in addition, Sinister provided me with a a $10 off coupon  as a first time purchaser!  The locks came quickly and they were packed well and in perfect shape.  I have already recommended Sinister to my friends and I will definitely order from Sinister again.  It was a very good experience.< /review>

I,have used Sinister Diesel on several different occasions to purchase parts to upgrade my 05 Powerstroke and i have been extremely happy with their service, parts have arrived quickly and without damage.  They have a wide selection of parts and kits to get the job done. And the one time that i did need to return some items it was hassle free.
I,would highly recommend Sinister Diesel, and i will continue to use them as i continue to  keep my truck on the road for many years to come.</review>

By 5 stars for SD and Aaron in ordering.  I received a wrong alternator, but Aaron researched it and got me the correct part.  Second issue was with the SD motor mounts for the duramax.  The mounts arrived timely but two fastening nuts for the mount bushings were missing.  Again, I turned to Aaron and the missing parts were over nighted so that the project could be completed.

Sinister is not a innovative company at all. Most of what they sell is ripped off from Other companies and made in China. Poor quality and horrible consistency in parts.

Not to mention they ise fear tactics and lies to attempt to bully anyone they see as a threat.

I wouldn’t recommend doing business with this sorry excuse of a company.< /Text>

It showed up a few days later. The steering damper for my Ram 2500 was a good fit and easy install. Can't vouch for the customer service as others are complaining about because they got my order right and I didn't need to call them. That alone says I'll come back again.</text>< pics>

Very fast shipping, the stuff I ordered was built way better than I expected at a reasonable price. One of the t-shirts I ordered was out of stock in my size so they threw in some cool stuff and an extra shirt for my wife,,and an actual hand written note which you don't get now days. Great company, great people!! Hope I don't need any parts lol but if I do they have my business< /text>

< Review>
We've used sinister for my wife's Ford 6.0 power stroke, the sales reps have always been very helpful and have gone way beyond to make sure we have the right parts fast and at a great price.  There office staff is great also, we've dropped in to the office with our three boys, ages 8-10 and they are always giving them something cool, top notch customer service and we are very happy with the quality.</Review>

Needed a new set of heads for my 6.0 and Sinister had it in stock and shipped it quickly.  We got all the bulletproofing parts from here.  Great customer service as well.< /review>

Ordered a part that did not work as described and was incomplete to allow for normal operation of the vehicle after install. Even after chatting with two "technical advisers" before ordering to ensure the part wouldn't cause a CEL it was obvious these two had no idea what they were talking about despite their assurances to me. Took them a month to respond to numerous calls and emails about the issue and even now more than FIVE WEEKS after the original email they still haven't answered the question as to whether or not I can return it. Garbage product, garbage customer service. Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere, this company is useless from start to finish.<//review>

I frequently purchase products from Sinister Diesel not only because of the quality of merchandise they produce & sell, but also because their stuff makes my truck perfom better and looks great when I pop the hood on my Duramax!

I keep my engine blue all day, everyday the Sinister way!

I have ordered multiple items from Sinister Diesel and always had a good experience.  The last item that I purchased from them was their brand 4" exhaust for my 6.0 L Powerstroke.  I had my brother help me put it on and he was skeptical since it was after market.  We were both impressed with the quality and how well it fit.  I would not hesitate buying more from Sinister Diesel in the future.<//text>

Our independant repair shop has used Sinister Diesel for years. They provide a top notch quality product that has great brand recognition. Our customers request their parts by name and know they are getting what they pay for!</Review>

I bought Sinister Diesels coolant filter kit. It installed correctly for my 2004 Ford F250 6.0. I've had it for approximately one month now and am about to change the first filter. Hopefully it's doing its job, I expect to see quite a bit of debris unfortunately. I'll try and repost, or update my post after my findings!</text>

Sinister Diesel is great to work with and their products are just what my truck needs.  I have a Ford 6.0L and these products allow it to run to its full potential.< /Review>

I ordered an EGR delete kit for my 2006 Duramax and could not be happier with the install.  The kit came with everything I needed for the install.  The quality of the part is second to none, love the color and the sinister decal on the piping, it adds to the look of the engine bay.  I am 100% satisfied with the customer service I received from Sinister Diesel, receiving email notifications when the part shipped as well as emails asking if I received everything I ordered on-time and undamaged.  Great Company to deal with, will order again from Sinister Diesel.< /Text>

Bought a 2003 f250 Superduty and my mechanic purchased everything I would need from sinister diesel to fully bullet proof my 6.0. It's been about two years now and havnt had any issues what's so ever. Ordered some sinister diesel apparel for a couple of christmas gifts this year. Had a little trouble with my order when it arrived. Emailed them that day and got a response that very day. Costumer service was great. Thank you. Looking forward to doing business with sinister diesel again.</Text>

<text>Very fast and very affordable. Sinister had exactly what I needed for replacing the head gaskets on my 05 LLY. The kit with the ARP head studs was the best-priced one around and I saved literally hundreds of dollars. Fantastic company and I will continue to do business with them.< /text><user>110569360531112965850</user><Time>1493736327974<//Time><username>Tyler Davis</username><rating>5</rating><response>None</response>< pictures>

I had never ordered from Sinister before and I defiantly don't regret it, the parts I ordered are working great but the best part is I didn't have to wait forever on my order, only took 2 days to get here and that is amazing.<//Review>

I've been trying to get ahold of someone for over a week to order a $5,000 BD transmission and torque converter. I don't know why I keep trying with this company. Today the receptionist told me that if I desire faster service, call someone else. Will do, thank you for the advice!< /Text>

<review>Order a $1000.00 Hpop and they don't send the Hpop cover gasket?  WOW.  I also tried to order an exhaust that I was told on the phone would ship in a day or two only to get an email 3 days later that it was back ordered for 8 to 10 weeks.  Spent a lot of money and wish I would have taken my money else where.  I would recommend using a local shop to order parts not these guys.  HORRIBLE if ask me....</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I have nothing but great things to say about Sinister Diesel! I was in the middle of doing the 6.0 bulletproof and received a part that got damaged during shipping. Called Sinister and they overnighted a new oil cooler and threw in a free hat and some stickers! Best customer service and support I have ever worked with.< /text>

2007 F350 4X4 had installed 50hp boost on injectors and 100hp on FICM. I then was not breathing enough so installed SINISTER intake all pipes and a stainless racing exhaust 5" from turbo back. She runs like a banshee Indian on fire. My exhaust has muffler so much quieter than most (wife likes dat). I love all that blue under the hood. Told my wife I may take the hood off, LOL. It's lots of fun to drive.< /Text>

<review>Bought my egr delete kit and sct tuner couple years back for my 2015 f250. Parts were shipped quickly. Egr delete kit had no instructions couldn't find any on the website had to install without. I do get a large amount of emails with suggested parts.. That are never the right part for my year model. But overall  happy with them.</review><Date>1493767066745<//Date><gmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8<//gmapID>< Name>

< Review>
I had a major melt down with my12 year old 2005 6.0 Power Stroke Diesel Excursion. Oil Cooler ruptured internally and pumped 4 quarts of oil into my radiator. I went to the Web site for Sinister Diesel and did some initial research and then contacted Eric by Phone. He was most helpful and I ordered a package deal. It had an updated Oil Cooler, new design EGR Cooler, upgraded Stand Pipes, Dummy Plugs, HPOP update kit, upgraded Turbo Oil Feed Line, Drain Tube, Blue Spring kit, Bypass Oil filter kit, Bypass Coolant filter kit and all the necessary filters, gaskets and hardware to get the job done right the first time. I had looked elsewhere for most of this stuff, but the packaging and completeness of there kits are second to none and the price was right. I feel my 6.0 PSD should last me a long time now.< /Review>

The first time I heard about Sinister Diesel is going to a NHDA show in Phoenix, Az. Then I called to ask a couple questions about my cousins dodge and they answered my questions right away and was very helpful. I would definitely recommend them to others.< /Review>

<review>Ordered a redesigned, Stainless steel EGR Cooler for my Duramax, web site and ordering process was all very straight forward and professional. Unfortunately for me Sinister is very professional and had to cancel my order because I live in California and their EGR Coolers are not yet CARB approved. The next day I confirmed that my money was refunded. In the end, I cant really complain about anything other than the Govt got in my way. I found a work around later on down the road so - I would recommend Sinister.</review>< pictures>

Intake bridge on my GMC sierra works great. Sinister Diesel answered all my technical questions. They were addressed in a professional & user specific manner. My Duramax has been a complete nightmare  since new. Trying to get the OEM side to work was impossible with normal driving, that included long runs empty.(50 miles+)  Towing heavy loads is mandatory to keep the exhaust system open. Trying to manage intake air on a diesel engine is stupid and asking for operational problems. You can measure & record parameters on any engine, but trying do what the Auto Industry has tried do to on a diesel engine ridiculous.<//Text>

So the fixed heads and pushrods and gave it back saying all fix now enjoy soon as I started it it felt funny so I called my mechanic he put a snap on machine on it and it said a injector was bad but there brand new high performance 1 sinister sold me also they re flashed and lost my tune and said I need to purchase a new 1 I told him u lost it so he gave me a tunner next my performance fuel pump didn't work so they factory 1 back up and gave me a new hp 1 and said u hook it up also I got my truck back with masking tape holding the mass air meter on RIGGED finally I got it going and the fuel pump went out last night and had to get towed home only 50 miles on Motor and sinister parts this is the biggest waste of 20k ever 15 in parts and 5 k in labor so far so buyer be ware not strait up people</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
This place is a joke of a company that uses bait and switch pricing/tactics to get your personal information and then harass you with 10 dollar off emails,( fix the unsubscribe button) don’t waste your money with this company there are plenty of diesel companies out there with the same products.< /Review>
