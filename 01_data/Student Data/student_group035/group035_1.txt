I'm writing an addendum to say that I got my first haircut by Tonia and it's the best one I've ever gotten! She intuitively understood how to add stylish layers to my particular hair texture and wave. The real test is that it looks great without blow drying it! She also continues to cover every strand of gray. Grateful for her talents and considerate, caring personality!</review>

Being in the hospital for a week I wasn’t able to brush my curly hair, so I came in looking like a matted poodle. Suny was SO amazing; She reassured me we wouldn’t have to shave it and took THREE hours to untangle my mess. I’ve been here multiple times before too and always loved the results.< /text>

Got a recommendation from my boyfriend to go see Logan (he has longer hair and his hair looks fantastic all the time). She is an amazing stylist! I'm always nervous about haircuts and she made me feel comfortable, asked lots of questions, and absolutely nailed my cut.<//Text>

Had a great experience at this salon. I have been loving my cut and very grateful to the stylist for recommending their conditioning treatment. Since my visit, my hair feels soft, healthy and looks great!  They were very quick at getting me in for an appointment and the stylist listened to my concerns and answered all of my questions.< /review>

<text>I had an amazing experience! Highly recommended place. Just moved to San Diego and was afraid to try a new hairdresser. I booked an appointment at the same day and was lucky enough to have "Louise" as my hairdresser. She gave me an amazing haircut, just like I wanted it and my girlfriend loves it! The prices are reasonable as well; $25 for a short haircut. Thank you for being so professional.</text>< Pics>

<text>I wanted to try going somewhere where they would not mess up my hair. I have this anxiety when it comes to getting my hair cut. Stylist will always mess it up because it is a complicated hairstyle. Which is why i only cut my hair about once every year and a half.  I visited there last year and they did a great job! I loved my hairstyle that i have been wanting for so long that no other hairstylist were able to accomplish. Since then i have gone to get it cut about 3 times. Which is more than i ever would in a span of a year. They wash your hair before every hair cut and once they are done they also style it. And it was only $20 it is amazing!! I always go here and nowhere else! They also offer their clients complimentary coffee or water while waiting.<//text>< username>

I like this place a lot. I go to Nicole all the time. She has a great eye for balance and consistency. I recommend this place and definitely recommend her for your next hair cut.

The environment is nice, when you go in they provide you with beverage options. Coffee, tea, water or beer and wine i think. I may need to double check that beer and wine.

If you're in the area, pay them a visit.< /text>

Very friendly, very willing to work with you and take the time needed to make you happy. I had exactly what I wanted in my head and described it to Danielle and showed her a picture, and she cut it to the exact image, but I wasn't happy with it, even after styling. It wasn't the cut, it was just how it looked on me, so I asked her if she would help me figure out a cut that I liked more and she helped me with no hesitation. Great experience, will be returning to have her cut my hair again.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I had high hopes for this place because I saw all the positive reviews, but to say the least I was very disappointed. I went in for a cut & color, my stylist was Paulette. I should’ve known when I showed her the picture of what I wanted and she seemed unsure and asked for a second opinion from the other stylists, that it wasn’t going to be what I wanted. She spent 6 hours on my hair only for it to come out terrible. My highlights were choppy at the roots not blended at all. I had 3 different tones of blonde in my hair. Part of it was brassy, part of it was ash blonde(almost gray), and a dirty blonde. I could tell towards the end she wasn’t confident in her work, as she asked the other girl closing with her to cut my bangs after she had already blow dried my hair. I paid $235 for what looked like amateur work from a school salon. I came back to have it fixed by another stylist, Thomas. He did a great job making me feel comfortable and addressing my concerns. Although my hair did not turn out exactly how I wanted, which it should have for the price I paid, it was suffice enough that I could walk around without being embarrassed of my hair. The owner was also very polite, however after my experience with Paulette I would not recommend this salon.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

After moving to San Diego, finding a place that took the time an care for your hair took some time. But eventually found this place and have been coming back ever since. Decent prices and the service is great. I go to see Nora every time. She's a champ! Highly recommend.</review>

I have long blond hair and needed to get my hairline colored. They did a great job! The owner is from Germany and very friendly, just like the staff. They are very professional and the result even looks better than in Germany. A cut (women and men) costs 20$, the color 40$ and an intensive hair treatment 30$. I took something with me to put into my hair once or twice a week which also costs 30$. Yes, beauty got its price, but I can really recommend this hairdresser.< /Text>

<Text>They raised their prices, and charged $10 extra for long hair... $35 for a 1/2 inch trim from my barely chest length hair. Rip off! Stylist failed to understand my concern about removing the split ends, where they were, and gave me a run of the mill trim. My upper layer (with the most damage) wasn't cut at all. She explained that I could come back if I wasn't happy for free if it was roughly within a week. I'll just go elsewhere.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>While I was at a conference in San Diego, I needed a haircut.  Found Gio & Gio and was thrilled.  Within walking distance of my hotel, got in immediately without an appointment, and only paid $20 for a fabulous haircut.  Yay!  The staff was talented and friendly.  What more can you ask for?</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80d954a77908d69f:0x2034e2ced7f3eb7f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Arrived in the city with hair looking like a 5 year old cut it, went along to Gio and Gio and they sorted me right out! No appointment, no hassle and made me feel very welcome. Not one of your smart, glossy, fancy places but you get a good cut band blow dry without paying a fortune and you are kind sat in a glass box with people watching you. Heartily recommend them.

Sadly I wrote the above before washing my hair the next day! My fringe (bangs) is wonky with long strands strands coming down over my face! With a bit of placement and pushing about I can just about get away with it, the rest of my hair (I am told as I can't see it) is good. Since arriving back in the UK I have had it trimmed again and the strands are gone but I need it to grow before I can have it cut straight.

Still stand by the nice people  and bug thanks for fitting me in, maybe a one off error and maybe my hair being dried before cutting the fringe (bangs) was not such a good idea!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80d954a77908d69f:0x2034e2ced7f3eb7f</gmapID></record>

Normally i do not make comments as long as i do not really love the place but this was my worst hair salon experience and i decided to to let people know because most of the time at least for a month you have to live with an ugly hair. So normally i have a hair stylist but this place was closer and i heard good thinks about it so i went there to have new highlights, i already had platinum ends but roots my roots came out then i showed them a picture of a hair that i want. She told me it wont be the same, i said that's ok it can never be the same but similar to this and i told her maybe more than 10 time i really do not want 2 things, one of it reddish blond the other one is ashy blond. I was even thinking I'm being rude and bothering her by repeating this too many times. She first did root color then highlight and it came out dart on the roots and ashy on the ends of my hair. The other girl tried to fix it but it did not change much, i was really upset because it was not just they could not do what i want they also ruined what i had. As a plus when she was trying to fix my hair, my scalp was burning a lot because they used a lot of stuffs, i know when you color your hair it burns but this was a lot more than normal. I don't even know how she could get all ashy on my ends. I did not let her dry my hair and just left. I got more angry when she told me that she already said it won't be the same with the picture but it was not even close and it turned out what i really hate and told many time times that i don't want.When i wanted to pay the owner said that i don't need to pay but i paid the half of it plus tip because they spend 6 hours to ruin my hair.<//Text>

$20 Haircut for women in a high end Salon is genius, the cuts are extremely professional and beautiful. 3 of my friends also tried this place once I told them about it and we are all now regular customers. Bye bye $60-$80 haircuts.
Now I can afford to cut my hair more frequently.</Review>

Don't give these people your business.  I asked for a 4-inch haircut, and the woman cut 8+ inches off my hair. I MEASURED IT after taking what was left off the floor. This was NOT what I asked for. It took me 10 years to grow my hair that long.  I am upset beyond belief.  I can barely braid my hair anymore.</review>

<date>1532986876949< /date><rating>1<//rating><review>I got my hair cut from Louise and I'd like to think what happened was a fluke.  She seemed very knowledgable but what I ended walking away with didnt reflect that.  At one point during my haircut Louise needed to pull in a second stylist because she was having trouble with blending my hair in the back.  I've never had that happen to me before.  When the haircut was done my hair, she had cut one section in the back super short.  I thought maybe it was just that section I didnt like but over time I realized the entire haircut was not blended and hair lengths in the front didnt match.  My new stylist called it a "reverse mullet."  Worst haircut ever.  This was three months ago and Im going to need another three months to grow it out.< /review>< Pics>

Unfortunately. The woman 'Nicole' cutting my hair wasn't really paying much attention and some what sarcastic. I guess she doesn't like British people but no way to treat a paying customer. Gio the owner was great.< /text>

< review>
Tried this place a few days ago, got one of the best fades ever.
Highly recommend this place, looks like a super expensive salon but it was only $20 including shampoo ; )<//review>

The wine selection and authentic food, like chocolate from all the world, is incredible. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful. I came in looking for a bottle of wine for dinner and left with a great choice and a Lithuanian chocolate bar to go along with it.<//text>

One of the best - limited and well selected stock of cheese, charcuterie, wine and other deli items. Service is always outstanding, the staff know what they're selling and are are able to make good suggestions. It's actually the great staff that sets this place apart - I'll pay a little more but always get great value.<//Review>

Awesome little shop selling wines and other goodies. But, I come here for their delicious sandwiches ($10 on weekdays and $12 on Saturday).

[9/13/17] it's back as my go-to sandwich place.

[2/12/16] while the sandwiches are still very good here, I have been getting mine at Central Station Deli.< /Review>

I almost don't want to post a review and keep this place to myself! Killer wine and cheese selection with an incredibly knowledgeable staff to back it up. Small and well curated selection of snacks, jams, sauces, and accoutrements. Will be back to try the huge sandwich selection soon. Love this place!!< /text>

a great local spot to purchase wine or cheese.  At every price point.  If you're grabbing cheese to go to an outing, picnic or a party, amazing options.  They do free tastings on Thursdays of some great local wines.  Overall - a great local spot.<//text>

Excellent selection of local and European wines and cheeses.  Also has specialty pastas, chocolates, almonds, cookies and more.  Everything is well laid out in not only an attractive manner but also in a way that makes it easy to peruse.  I wanted to purchase everything in the store!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>This shop is a real treasure with each wine carefully selected and clearly deserving of a place among its collection. Owner Jay Esopenko, equipped with a rolodex memory of tasting notes, truly enjoys discussing and answering questions about his  impressive collection of varietals, inc. some truly key buys, making it virtually impossible to leave without a well chosen wine to suit any need or desire.

The same can be said for Little Vine's cheese selection, its fragrance hitting you the moment upon entering with a heady aroma coming off an equally impressive variety, similarly chosen with great care.

So too, the chocolate made by local craftspersons working with the finest sourced ingredients, adding to the wonder of everything there is to discover at Little Vine.

Oh...and the coffee! Not a better cup in North Beach; it's roasted in small batches and ground per order,  brewed by the cup, and ready to drink immediately. No over roasted, over heated mud served at this place.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Had tooth extracted without any issue's.  My old dentist didn't charge anything out of pocket with insurance but he died.  Been dentist shopping ever since for the same kind of dealio.  And Blanco dental care has come the closest out of 3 dentists I've tried so far.<//Text>

I've been to other dentist, and let me tell you that this dentist really cares at a personal level for his patients. My gums are so sensitive, that I dread having to be numbed. I was sooo happy, I was shaking from the thought of the needle piercing through my gums. Low and behold, the dentist was so gental, I didn't feel anything. The way the doctor talked me through everything that he was doing, put me at ease.  It calmed my nerves, and made this visit so pleasant. I'm absolutely his patient for life. Patient for life.< /Review>

<Review>I had been looking for a dentist for a while, “perhaps I was procrastinating just a little”. I chipped my tooth on Sunday and I was totally freaking out thinking it was going to take me a week or 2 to get it looked at and or fixed. I called blanco circle dental Monday morning and they took me later that same day! The girls at the front desk are absolute darlings, they are welcoming and attentive. I was quickly taken back and I was in and out with a fixed tooth within 30 minutes! Emily was great, as was the doctor!

I recommend Blanco Circle Dental Care! They have a really nice, clean office. Everyone was super friendly. My hygienist, Nadine, took her time to make sure I was comfortable throughout the entire process. Lizbeth, her assistant, made sure I was taken back to the room quickly and with a smile.<//Review>

I was fairly nervous with the transition from a pediatric dentist to a general dentist, but Monica and Yesenia have made the transition so welcoming! They are always so sweet and quick to offer juice or water. It’s clear that they always want to ensure that the patients are as comfortable as possible! Really appreciate it.<//review>

<review>I had my first check-up/cleaning in a long time, and they were very friendly, professional, and quick.  The lady dentist who cleaned my teeth even gave me advice about college.
I went back for a filling and they did an excellent job with no pain.  They were very professional and answered all my questions.  The only reason there’s not 5 stars is because I prefer to be told before being given numbing agent—especially when it’s injected via syringe in my mouth.  If I didn’t know about numbing agent being injected via syringe beforehand, as I’ve had a tooth removed before, I would’ve likely panicked just because it was so sudden.  It doesn’t look like a typical plastic syringe either, so if you’re not paying super close attention, you won’t notice until if pierces you.  However, I’m the type of person who hates surprises and doesn’t get too freaked out about needles, so maybe they can’t tell you because that would make it impossible with some people.
Overall, great work and great customer service experience.</review>< Pics>

<text>Dr. Hajdari is absolutely amazing: sincere, informative, & very professional, letting me know at each step what to expect, what to do, attentive to my comfort & checking as to level of pain, if any (none for me!). Dental assistants Janelle & Jose were perfect complements to Dr. Hajdari's expertise. It was easy to put my absolute trust in all of them!

I have been going to Blanco Circle Dental Care for a few years now.  I look forward to my checkups.  I enjoy the relaxing, painless, and fun visits each time I go. My Hygienist, Candy always has a smile, and is very personable. Dr. Hajdari (Dr. Ed) is professional, always responds to my questions, and most importantly funny, sometimes I think I don't need nitrous oxide when Dr. Ed shares his wisdom.  Keep up the great work:)</text>

<review>UPDATE from my last review after some minor treatment - You could say "First Class Customer Service Demonstration, FREE with each visit". The Dentistry is very good too. 5 STARS in my book.

My first visit to this practice! My overall impression is that Blanco Circle Dental Care is going to be a good experience. Kind, courteous, informative, thorough and professional are words that comes to mind when I reflect on all the staff and my overall experience. With some minor treatment on the horizon I have no hesitation in returning. Well done all!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

I have had the good fortune of have found Blanco Dental Circle to care for all my dental needs. I was once terrified of going to the dentist which made me avoid it completely. My first visit changed everything I ever knew about a dentist, Mikayla made sure I had everything I needed and that I was comfortable every step of the way. Rosie made my cleaning an enjoyable visit listening to all my concerns and informing me on how to take better care of my teeth. Everyone in the office is warm, welcoming and you will never feel judgment. Overall I would recommend anyone to take a visit and experience a different kind of dentist.< /text>

<Text>Found this place by luck, since my first visit have had great experiences with front desk being very helpful, funny and nice. Mostly being helped by Antonio making sure I’m always comfortable and set up nicely even helping me start my teeth whitening.  Dr. Hajdari is great, being very commutative about steps he takes during my visits, along with making sure I am as comfortable as can be. Whole staff makes best effort to help you have the best, most comfortable experience while being very understanding if you’re little nervous about being at the dentist.</Text>< Gmap_id>

After a very bad experience, it took me 25 years before I was forced to return for dental care.  I really appreciate that the office was nonjudgmental when I did seek service.  They were able to schedule more than one procedure per visit so that the bulk of my needs were met in three visits.  I chose conscious sedation for these first three visits.  After the third visit, Dr. Partridge talked to me about saving my money; I really did not need sedation.  He told me that he was known as Dr. "Painless" Partridge.  I took his challenge.  I must commend him for keeping his word.  I wish to thank Antonio for his pleasant demeanor in assisting.  Thank you Vanessa for keeping the most painful part (payment) professional and congenial.  Thank you to all the staff for an overall doable experience.  A+ grade to you, Dr. Partridge.< /review>

My experience at Blanco Dental Care was life changing. I was immediately greeted by Leslie at the front desk. Ysenia made sure I was 100% comfortable by providing me with leg pillows, warm blankets, blacked out glasses, and headphones while she cleaned my teeth. (I experienced little to no pain throughout the entire process. I was actually really surprised because I hate going into the dentist.) At the end, Monica carefully explained my next steps, set my future appointments, and addressed my concerns. All three of these ladies were extremely helpful and respectful. If I could give them 10 stars I would. (:< /Text>

I would give it a negative Star if I could. All these reviews are fake! This place is one big scam. Be very careful of whom you see and their advice. I had a terrible visit there which led to days of agony and their office Manager is just after money, due or not. Be carfull of giving them your credit card as well. I was chrged for amounts that the insurance said I had no responsibility for. Avoid this place if you can is my strongest recommendation.<//Review>

This place is FANTASTIC. I worked with an incredible staff team. I met Yesenia the front desk representative who was helpful and in high spirits ! Waiting area was pleasant with coffee and interesting pictures to look at. Antonio was the dentist assistant whom I also had the pleasure of meeting, he has so much respect and great conversations and is very attentive, he made sure I felt safe and confortable with every step of the process and let me know what he was doing before he did it as I put down on my checklist when I initially came in that I would prefer which means these professionals actually read charts and follow through with why the client needs ! Dr Raissi did my fillings (before my crowns) stable and was very professional throughout the whole process!! Dr Raissi did a GREAT JOB and last but not leastttt was the fabulous Dr Hajdari who was SO knowledgeable and discussed everything properly and perfectly and went over the process of my crowns with visuals as well. There was no question he wasn’t able to answer and the outcome of Dr Hajdari’s job on my two front teeth was PHENOMENAL I’ve never felt more confident with my teeth and to make it even better for the first time in 10 years I have no sensitivity or pain with my teeth!!! So grateful for everybody at Blanco Circle Dental 😊<//text>

Although I’ve been a patient here for years, I recently had sedation dentistry.  Dr Klugman and staff were wonderful.  I would definitely have sedation again for any major work.
Regular visits are just as great too.
It’s a very comfortable office.   None like I have ever been and I’m here to stay.< /Text>

<Text>Usually I'm terrified of the dentist, but for the first time I wasn't they're are very polite and gentle with any work that has to be done on your teeth. As soon as I walked in the ladies in the front greeted me. My appointment was on time, and I appreciated the tour around the office. I want to thank Monica up in front for letting me know I'll be in great hands; and I was. I seen Rosie for my cleaning and she was very nice and she made me feel better after telling her I was terrified. For my exam I seen Dr. Partridge and his assistant Antonio and what A great pair I felt the care and concern. Thank you to the Blanco Circle team!<//Text></record>

Nothing but crooks! Check Yelp reviews.I have to say I was treated like a VIP on my first yearly exam visit at Blanco Circle Dental Care, they give you a warm blanket and the T.V Remote, but when I got my bill for 456 dollars for a 20 minutes visit,  it's a scam. I have the same dental  insurance for 15 years and I never had to pay anything out of my pocket for a simple exam. I go to the dentist yearly, but I decided to try this place for the reviews, S T A Y  A W A Y FROM THIS PLACE. On my exam this doctor wanted to redo some of my fillings and fix new cavities that don't exist, get a second opinion before you trust this place, it's a scam. I was lucky to know one of the dental assistant, she told me to go somewhere else because this place will do unnecessary dental work.< /review>

The dental assistant instructructed me to keep product on for 1-4 hours per day until i got the results i wanted. The first time i used the product, i ended up only leaving it on for an hour because my teeth were sensitive. The second time i tried it, i left it on for 2 hours and though it did whiten my teeth it also made one of my teeth (that already had a stain on it) look worse then before.

<review>My husband was in extreme pain over the weekend.  We called first thing Monday morning to try to get him in to deal with the tooth ache.  The staff and the dentist were truly amazing; the cream of the crop!!!  We were able to make all of the necessary arrangements for my husband's sedation and treatment that same day!  Talk about service.  I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a beautiful office full of talented, warm and caring individuals.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I had a terrible experience.  My tooth broke in half and the root was exposed , I am in a tremendous amount of pain. I can't drink or allow air to hit my tooth. I called the office and spoke to the receptionist,  I told her I needed a surgical extraction could she please check with the dentist, She assured me the dentist are capable of performing  "All types of extractions". When I got there the dentist said he couldn't extract the tooth I need to see a oral surgeon.  Than a RDA brought me a prescription and went over the medications with me incorrectly,  Mind you I'm a RN. I asked to speak with the dentist again,  He rushed me and didn't properly answer my questions . I am livid it was a waste of time and money.</Review>

The booking process was easy and efficient. I had all the forms filled out prior to the appointment and the check in was quick and easy thanks to Sara. There was absolutely no waiting time in the lobby and before I knew it, I was sitting in Drs. chair. I came in for a check up but walked away with so much more than that. The doctor and Veronica really take there time to assess your dental needs and most importantly, to educate you in the process. Unlike my previous experiences, with other  doctors I truly felt empowered and confident that what he recommended was exactly what I needed. The doctor is also extremely gentle and really takes his time with his work. Thank you Dr. and the entire team at Blaco Circle Dental Care for such a positive experience.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808df87b6253605d:0xe98d5d0f1f37452a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Let me start by giving huge kudos to, Mikayla, Vanessa, Jenny, Dr. Raissi and the rest of the staff. When I first started coming here, I was literally quite phobic of dentists. As you can see, I have 20+ check-ins at BCD. (I had tried many different dentists, throughout the years). I’ve stuck with Blanco Circle Dentist because they are the best! The staff is excellent, the office is inviting and they truly listen and address, each and every concern that you could possibly have. I confidently recommend Blanco Circle Dentist.</Text>< Response>

I was suffering deep  dental pain .  I called Blanco circle dental care, and they were Great from the first moment I spoke with the receptionist. She was very concerned about my pain and was able to get me in to see what was bothering me right away. When I arrived I was greeted with full attention and care II downloaded the paperwork ahead of time from their website which made it so easy to fill it out at home. I was taken in the back by the dental assistant. She was so nice and gentle took a few exrays made me feel at ease. Then the Doc came in and gave me an exam. Gave me like 4 options.  Did not force any of them. we actually discussed the differences Money seemed  not a problem with him. They wainted me to have what made feel  better. Not whether my insurance would pay for it.  I felt so grateful for not having to worry about how i was going to pay.. Doc said the girls will take care of me with a payment plan. A little worried oh no I won't be able to make affordable paynents. BUT NO she totally understood my finances and made it work. And squuezed me in during a very busy schedule the next morning. They had a cleaning, exam/whitiing speciall going on. Can't wait for mine I need to heal first. (Check their specials  very reasonable) My procedure was totally comfortable and painless. Doc even ran into some unexpected root problem.  doc called me later that evening to see how I was doing gave me his cell phone number and told me not to hesitate to call him if there is any concerns. I was well taken care of. Thank You So Much for your Care . Blanco circle Dental care 😊<//Text>

Patient First Attitude! Dr. Gondora is an excellent dentist whose main priority is making sure her patients are comfortable and get the best dentistry she can offer. I never really like dentist, but she is the best that i have been encountered.

What an amazing dentist! Dr. Gondora and her staff are very friendly and passionate about their work and greeted me the second I walked in. The office is beautiful and CLEAN! Very modern and updated.
Loved to talk to Sara, she was very helpful, she help me with my insurance, thank you so much.

(Translated by Google) My husband and I received a consultation, x-ray, and dental cleaning. From the entrance everyone was very kind and cordial with us. The office is clean and the atmosphere is familiar and comfortable. The person who cleaned us was very careful about our comfort, even offering me a blanket for the cold as well as making sure to constantly use the saliva extractor so I didn't spend it :) The bathroom was clean and had a system air filtration :) The dentist was very friendly too ... The best dental experience we have ever had. We have not done dental work yet apart from cleaning but later we plan to return to do dental work 🦷. Thanks to the entire team for showing that you care about your patients.

Mi esposo y yo recibimos una consulta, rayos x y limpieza dental.  Desde la entrada todos fueron muy amables y cordiales con nosotros.  La oficina está limpia y se percibe un ambiente familiar y cómodo.  La persona que nos hizo la limpieza dental fue muy cuidadosa de nuestra comodidad que asta me ofreció una cobijita para el frío además de asegurarse de usar constantemente el extractor de saliva y así no me la estuve pasado :)  El baño estaba limpio y tenía un sistema de filtración de aire :) El dentista fue muy amable también...La mejor experiencia dental que hemos tenido.  Aún no nos hemos hecho trabajo dental aparte de la limpieza pero más adelante pensamos regresar a hacernos trabajos dentales 🦷. Gracias a todo el equipo por mostrar que le les importan sus pacientes.<//text>

The dolma was so old and dry it was inedible. Please have someone at the front who has some knowledge of the food or what’s in it. The saving grace (why I didn’t leave 1 star) was when I asked for warm pita, after receiving it cold, it came warmed from the grill and not the microwave as I expected given the quality of the other food. It’s like a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch... it never looks as good as the pictures.< /text>

Ali Baba has all the makings for a great restaurant experience. The owners have really taken the time to decorate ever inch of the place. From the great flooring to the matching colors thru out. The right music playing, even the bathrooms are really done nicely. So what happened to the food and the service? Why is the place empty?

My wife and I were really shocked to discover that the food was bland and some of it old. The plating is done fairly well, with the portion sizes fair. (See photos) The meat in the kebob combo was cook great, but was bland. No flavor at all. The garlic potatoes were old and dried out. The garlic sauce was bland. The Kebbeh was excellent! The hummas was ok. And the fatoush salad was just over season sumac no flavor of mint, lemon or parsley.

The waitress was cold and distant, but she was cleaning and doing side work. Maybe she just shes defeated by an empty place. She only came to our table to drop off the food. We even had to put our order thru a machine on the table. Where is the hospitality?  When it was time to pay she never thanked us or asked us how everything was.

Its really sad that Ali Baba wasnt what we wanted it to be. We wont be back sadly as we still search for the great Lebanese restaurant.</Review>

This place is off the beaten path but within easy walking distance of where I was staying. I liked the lamb kabob wrap and baklava. Service was good. Restroom was clean. No complaints.< /review>

First of all it's not mediterranean cuisine second all workers latino,  third food nasty and it's not fresh also food tables not clean and its smell like...., workers not friendly, careless, no welcoming and no good buy .

I spend like 17 $ and I left the dish with full of food , i had bad experience in this place and I recommend to find another restaurant to enjoy your time and spend money.<//Text>

LOVE the food here.  The chicken kabob is so well seasoned and tender.  The tabbouleh is so good too, a bit tarte for me, but very good.  I love adding some olive oil and quinoa.  The reason I took one star off is the service.  Every time I go there the people are rude.  Almost feel like they would prefer not to deal with customers.  I take out now.  Food is delicious!< /Review>

Overall taste is good and the portions are generous; however, all the meats are dry to me. Lentil rice is good and I love the eggplant salad yet again, meat is hard to swallow.</review>

I have eaten at Ali Baba dozens of times and have never been disappointed.  Their hummus is by far the best I’ve ever eaten.  Everything is always fresh.  It is really outstanding Middle Eastern food.  Give it a try; you won’t regret it!<//text>

<Review>The food is the real reason to come here, and to keep coming back.

Regular rotation for Mediterranean lunch. Falafel, roast chicken are faves. Consistency sometimes falters - roast chicken is sometimes too dry for my taste. Baklava varieties are evil here, can't resist.....Ample parking, with overflow lot across the street. It's a regular lunch place for everyone working in the area, so it can packed. Great, friendly service.</Text>

Was different from other Mediterranean places I've been. Fast service and unique tastes. Not the best location for a restaurant but, that's probably a good thing the wait and line for this place would be much longer if it had a good location.<//review>

Consistency sometimes falters - roast chicken is sometimes too dry for my taste. Baklava varieties are evil here, can't resist.....Ample parking, with overflow lot across the street. It's a regular lunch place for everyone working in the area, so it can packed. Great, friendly service.< /Review><Rate>4< /Rate><Name>Ed Chavez< /Name><Time>1472534016922<//Time></record></dataset><record>

It is a good place to have Mediterranean food. You have to order and pay for the food, they will you a numbe, take it and choose a table to sit. They will bring the food to your table.

The food taste is very good. If you want a little spicy or sour  or whatever they have different sauces available.

The price is also good enough and it is worth paying for the quality of the food.

They have a parking space available but limited to about 12 to 15 cars.

Over all it is a good place have some Mediterranean style food.</Text>

Food was mostly tasty, but pita and baba ganoush was stale.  This place is probably good in the morning when the food is made but our visit around 5 PM had much room for improvement.<//Text>

I ordered chicken kebab and it was dry and tough.  Also,  the meat was like less than quarter size while other pieces of kebab meat was a little larger.  The babaganoush- egg plant sip was tasty but no roasted and charred flavor.   Service is non existent.  They seem to make some people order at register while providing table service to others.   I guess they service friends or people in their same ethnic group. I mentioned my displeasure with the food and was dismissed.  I will never return to this restaurant.  Very disappointed.</Review>

<text>I came here for lunch with my friend, we ordered lentil soup, chicken with rice and kebab and besides ayran nothing was good. When l complain about the orders to the person who works there, she told me that “everybody loves our food” l m really wondering how they survive because it’s a terrible food, after one bite l couldn’t eat and just left... the food has nothing to do with Mediterranean cuisine, don’t take risk so don’t even try!!!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< gmapID>

<Review>Pretty ordinary middle eastern food in the middle of nowhere in South San Francisco. Only saving grace is it's proximity to SFO car rentals and some hotels. Overpriced for the portion sizes; the service was just okay, although the ambience, feel and decor would hint otherwise.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I've eaten here before and typically looked forward to it with excitement. it used to be good but unfortunately, not this time. I ate a late breakfast/lunch at an off hour about 3 pm so I inquired which shawarma was fresh.  The hostess answered that both are. I said but the chicken isn't on the rotisserie. She said they take it off so it doesn't spoil. I thought it made sense. I went with the chicken shawarma sandwitch to have there and ordered hummus and baba ghanooj to-go. Total bill $39.90.  The sandwitch tasted nothing like chicken shawarma should, was stale, and flavorless. It actually tasted old and like the meat was boiled in water. Not the usual char-rotisseried or at least grilled it is supposed to be. Even the bread was falling apart and didn't hold together. I was also very disappointed the hummus and baba ghanooj tasted sour the next day and not because of the lemon but because they're old and spoiled. I basically had to throw them both away.  Very disappointing! Not sure what happened to this place!<//Text><GmapID>0x808f79b0d8b9628b:0xb2cacbf7af974c8f<//GmapID>< Time>

<Review>One word.... kebba!!!! OMG they were amazing, little footballs of ground beef. I wish they were bigger!!

The pies were yummy, I especially liked the spinach and meat ones.

I could go on and on...this is now my favorite go to place for Mediterranean. The girl who took my order over the phone was very nice and answered all of my questions. I did have quite a few as I was placing a larger order.

Can't wait to go back!!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>The worst middle eastern food I have had in a long time.   Skimpy portions, dried out meat.  Despite nice people, it was truly awful.< /Review>< time>

Very nice flavours, good courteous service.  I particularly recommend the baba ghanouj, hummus, lentil (mujaddara) rice, kibbe, and chicken shawarma.  It's nice that they have wheelchair access, good for lunch or dinner, eat in or take out.</text>

Only their lamb is Halal. The wrap wasn't very seasoned and it had too much yogurt in it. It's a restaurant that doesn't have people from that region as cooks. No wonder it's off<//Text>

<Time>1621546511197</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Love this place! I ordered the pink matcha that has rose and beet juice in it and it was perfectly delicious and not overly sweet. I also had the tomato mozzarella flatbread pastry and thought it was tasty and a great savory snack. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and even a little dog bed for your BFF who wants to lounge with you. It’s kinda tucked into an alley, so park wherever and then make your way down Miller Alley rather than going on union etc.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0HOK7UNloPjmoBovWe2M3o0Oor9HADDSePfxZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEfuEU22jT4lRST_RW0ihAOrL7GbrsXPcyC_Jx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTqV5rxQgOkkkJ2GA0l5O3nyKn8_cfMEGbI9lH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1621829716591, 'text': 'You’re making us blush, Katherine!

The place is very cute and the coffee is good but your staff need to drop the attitude. I went Saturday afternoon and there were only 2 other customers waiting. The cashier was very sweet and helpful as it was my first time there. I paid for my drink and moved to the side/back to wait for it to be ready. Another staff says “can i help you with something?” I replied I was waiting to which says “she (the cashier) told you to wait outside”. Luckily, my drink was ready so I left. Sorry Im partially deaf and didnt know I was supposed to wait outside. Between  the partition, masks and music playing its a wonder anyone can hear anything. I won’t be going back.</text>

<user_name>Davina Dawson< /user_name><Time>1585337502815< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My husband and I wanted to try a few new places in the Pasadena area, and while walking around, we came across a sign on the Main Street, saying there were coffee and plants in the back. We followed the sign a little back patio, and came across hands-down the cutest coffee shop I have ever seen. We are both crazy coffee nuts, and we have travelled the world (Germany, Armenia, Dubai, Greece, several states) looking for great coffee shops. This place easily makes the top 5 list. Easily.

I’m not a fan of non dairy options, so when the owner, AC, told us everything was dairy free, I was worried I wouldn’t like the taste. He recommended trying oat milk, because it’s the closest to dairy options. My husband got a cappuccino with almond milk, and I got myself an oat milk 24k chocolate latte.

The drinks are delicious. Seriously delicious. I could not tell that my drink was missing dairy.

We also bought a cute little Coffee & Plants pin, something to take home, and I wanted to spend more money in the cafe.

I cannot begin to explain how cute this place is. It’s a little tight, and finding parking is a pain, but once you’re inside it’s hard to want to leave. Highly recommend and I’ll definitely be back.

< review>
Good coffee spot that's probably way better when itt's not covid. The drinks were great but the atmosphere of the shop and the instagrammableness of the drinks are probably much more appealing than the flavors of the drinks themselves.

They had some pretty unique coffee drinks with gold, lavendar, and other flavors but they seemed a bit overpriced for a take out drink. Came to support the business during the hard time and try something new but can't wait to be able to sit down outside in the patio and hang out with friends.

Parking really isn't great in the area, but there's a garage with one hour free near the apple store around the corner and metered street parking on side streets.

Can't wait to try this place again soon!< /review>

I've really enjoyed my visits to Coffee+Plants.  The specialty drinks are really fun. My favorite is the Lavender Latte (blue one in the pic).   As a coffee lover, I also appreciate a really great cup of black coffee too.  Their blend is one of the best I've tried and should not be missed.<//text>

<review>This is the sort of cafe where you'll spend the first 30 seconds deciding whether to look around or order first.
Definitely order first. The plants will still be there.

I hadn't actually intended to go here. I was on my way to somewhere else.
But... coffee? Plus plants? And everything is plant based?
Delicious cappuccinos and lattes.
'Pretty fly for a cacti.'
Drinkable gold.

This place is amazing. I had entirely too much caffeine.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583962733601, 'text': 'We will make sure they will!!!

This place is amazing, such unique lattes I've never heard of!  I tried the superfood latte and not exaggerating it was the best thing I've ever tasted.  I'll definitely be coming back to try the Rose and Lavender lattes.  Amazing decor inside, very cozy and the staff was really nice.  Would for sure recommend.</text>

<date>1582683101088</date><resp>None< /resp><user>105743509428982635180< /user><Review>This place was aesthetically pleasing. I was really excited to try their blue latte based on pictures of other reviews. I ordered it with oat milk and even though it was really pretty to look at, taste wise it disappointed me. The taste was really bland and not worth my money. Beware this drink is non-caffeniated so that is also another strike for me. I would have rated this place higher if it wasn't for the owner's sarcasm. My order had already been placed and he approached us asking if we were from Pasadena etc. As we were talking I noticed they had stamp cards at my reach, which are usually offered to the customer when they make a purchase. I simply asked if he could stamp a card so I could come back and he replied very rude "No" in a very sassy way....I was shocked and replied why not? In my head I thought am I missing something? It took him a few seconds for him to say "I mean I could have refused you know?" Then he went on saying imagine if I had refused? And I understood he was probably joking but I don't understand why an owner of a new small business would joke around like that with new customers on their first interaction with the place....I could have definitely felt very offended and ask for my money back. Which I didn't but that's the reason I won't be returning to this place. Even aside from the whole owner to customer interaction, the taste of the latte is not worth me going back. I would much rather go to other coffee places like Jameson Brown  Coffee Roasters or Copa Vida their lattes are perfection.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Went here last week and the woman that was working here was so rude and no personality. I even called ahead of time to see what matcha they used and she was even rude on the phone. The matcha is good quality but I will not be going here if I'm gonna get bad service.< /review>< Time>

<review>Good family dining.  Casual , cheaper steak. Kids menu is pretty good.  Kids chicken is tasty.  Service is always friendly.  I don't know if I just come at good times,  but I've never had to wait for seating.  The restaurant could use a make over,  but it kind if goes with the theme of the place.  All ages crowd.  I'd say it's a step or 2 above sizzles lol</review>< Pictures>

Steaks here are great. Absolutely wonderful customer service too. Our server was really nice and she was always asking if we needed anything else. Absolutely recommend it 👌< /Review>

First off  this is a family type restaurant, not a fancy joint. But the food is fantastic. We split a Plank Steak with baked potato, and salad. It was tender and juicy. We both loved it. The baked tater with all the trimmings was the best I have had in years. You will love this place. We will be going back this weekend.</text><gmapID>0x80dcb45cbaed4e8d:0x5399168e4fa5cc15< /gmapID></record>

I wasn't able to go often, only five to six times in the 12 years between when I first moved to Jurupa Valley and the restaurant's closure. But I will miss it. I honestly hope El Corral moves into Spunky Steer when the lease is up, and something not Mexican moves into El Corral, but we will see.</text>< user_name>

<Text>AWFUL SERVICE. I went to this steak house with my family because they swore by it saying it was a good hole in the wall steak house. Long story short we ordered and our salads were coming out and my sister in law had asked for a side of cheese.. she didn't know if the waiter knew to bring the cheese out with the salads, so when he dropped off our salads she nicely asked for the side of cheese again.. and our lovely waiter Jeremiah stated " God only gave me 2 hands so I'll go get the cheese now" first off rude... so then our food was coming out and the waiter hands me my plate of chicken strips (pictured) don't mind the bite taken out of the chicken strip from my son. I thought for $11 the chicken strips would be presented a little nicer than 4 little bites that were smaller than my steak fries. I  am not one to complain but I thought come on now this is pathetic. So I called the waiter over and I said "I'm not trying to be mean but these chicken strips are pathetic" and he stated well I'm not the one who made them. I said yes I know you did not make them but these chicken strips for one are nasty and two are tiny and pathetic looking... I was planning on still eating them but I wanted a discount beings how disappointing they were... Well according to Jeremiah he was unable to give me a discount on them. So I asked for a manager which he insisted there were no managers in at the time. So because he was so rude I told him to take the chicken strips off of the bill and I handed him back my pathetic plate.</Text>< pics>

My brothers love this place because of the steak but me not so much. I only eat halal, so can’t eat the meat here. But it’s good to gather with the fam and eat a simple salad or baked potato. Love the bread they serve here too.</Text>

< Review>
Service was impeccable. We had a party of 15 and they had over 3 servers handling our group which made ordering a breeze. Everything in the sampler was delicious with the exception of the loaded potatoes which were okay. I had the bacon wrapped filet dinner with salad. The first bites were delicious then the over-seasoning hit me, I recommend ordering it lightly seasoned if that's possible and probably medium rare since mine was medium and there was no pink in the center. Overall, I give this dish 3.5 stars. Ask for the dressing on the side for your salad because again it's doused with dressing. Staff was friendly and attentive which made experience overall 4 stars.<//Review>

<Review>I've been attend events at CBBA for 10 years. First 8 years were under different management.  Last 2 years were under different management. It got worse the last 2 years.
Prices at concession stands went up, and choices went down. As a handicapped person, I've been pushed around inside men's restroom, from father's with children, pushing me aside, to get into the handicapped stall. No security or usher helped that situation.
Parking lot attendants put cones away before all cars are out of the lot. I have almost been hit twice getting out or there.
There's more. But why bother.</Review>< pictures>

<review>We were very happy with the food, the portion sizes, and the service. We went in there on a busy Friday night, were seated promptly, and treated well. My steak and my girlfriend's steak were cooked right, and everything was very good.

It is quite a value for what you get!</review>< pictures>

Very disappointing. Nothing is homemade, all box prepared. Doesn't matter what type of steak ordered, it is all the same. Cut from a larger cheap cut of meat. I order a petite fillet, my partner order tritip. We actually matched up the cut from his. Nice atmosphere. Will not revisit.< /Text>

I used to frequent the Spunky Steer in Temecula many years ago, and loved it. I just found the Spunky Steer here in Norco this week. It still has a very tender steak selection huge potatoes with cheese butter and anything else you want on them and a great salad! It's very family-friendly and I'll be coming back frequently!</Review>

I just dont know where to start. EVERYTHING is ALWAYS so good when we {My Husband and I} go here, about 2-3 times a month. From the salad to the steak. The Salads are just the right size, so your not to full for your steak. The Baked Potatoes are HUGE and the steaks MELT in your mouth. They come to the table still cooking and you have to flip the steak a few times so it dont stick. We order our steaks Med. Rare and they are PERFECT. They are perfectly seasoned {no sauce needed} and like I said they melt in your mouth. WE LOVE THIS PLACE <3  EVERYONE has always been so nice also.</review>

The steak has a lot more fat than it use to have. The clam chowder has one or two pieces of clam. Lastly, I don't eat steak that often, but when I do I like it with original A1. My server claimed they were all out, I waited and asked her to bring some over when one was available. My server walked by me a few times and I could see  tables with guest who were done eating and just chatting. I never received my A1 and was unable to enjoy my steak to its fullest potential.<//Text>< name>

The service is okay, but the food is just awful. The stakes never come out how you ask, the bell peppers taist as if they've gone bad, the only thing that is good is the bread.<//Text>

Boy did we go wrong: sat for a long time and finally flagged down the hostess to give our drink order, who by the way was the only bright moment during a miserable experience. Ordered steaks; the filet was pure fat, the sirloin was pure gristle and inedible and my wife's was ok. Will NEVER go back !!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

My family has been coming here for about 10 years, today we got there at 1pm the host looked very tired yet we were seated quickly, the service was very slow they were extrememly short staffed, the food was perfect we waited half an hour to get refills on our water, the server was nice but seemed very stressed because they were short staffed!! We waited another 45 minutes for our ticket.. There was a 15% tip already added to our ticket we usually leave a $12-$15 tip just from my husband and I .. I don't feel that it should of been added to our ticket... I love this place but I honestly doubt we will return!!</text>

<Review>I ordered a filet bacon wrapped (Med) when it came the bacon was almost raw, the steak was rare/raw, I complained, they offered to bring a Hibachi to my table, I took the meat home and cooked it.

Another time I went after Church for Sunday breakfast, only scrambled eggs, I believe that is because they use powdered eggs. This was quite a few years ago and things may have changed, but I will never go back. Sorry.< /Review><name>Robert Curran< /name></record>

This place is great! I tried Himalayan tea, a smoked chicken dish, and chili momos. Everything was amazing. The owner also threw in the lamb tacos, which are a really smart dish. Basically everything we tried was fantastic.</Text>

I celebrated my PhD yesterday in this excellent restaurant. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a enjoyable evening and the place was surely the reason for that outstanding event. The team  participated in a sweet way, the cooking was great and my friends were so  glad. We shall definitely return for more joyful events. Thank you very much.< /Review>

The chilli momo was the best. As a Nepali I can confidently say that the momo I had here had great taste. (Typical Nepali Flavor)< /review>

Food from there was amazing. They are keeping up their high food standards even during this trying time. Other restaurants cant say the same. We picked up the food and it was still hot and delicious by the time we got home. Excited to keep ordering from there!< /Review>

<Review>Too quality food. I love their couples dinner deal, good food and a great price with a bottle of wine. The wine I felt tasted good. We've done the deal a few times, my husband only drinks whites and all have been decent wine. I haven't tried the reds.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><user>101336019980880173364< /user><GmapID>0x809b21176e326537:0x108a77448217bcba<//GmapID><user_name>Sarah Garland< /user_name><rating>5<//rating><resp>None< /resp><date>1583360392329<//date></record></dataset><record>

I had fish curry on the lunch and took home an order of Mulligatawny soup. Both excellent. Will definitely return and take family and friends. Glad they offer delivery.<//Text>

First time for us tonight and definitely won’t be the last. Our neighbor highly recommended this restaurant and we will be passing the word to others.  Food is fresh and flavorful, best Indian I’ve had in quite a while, and has the bonus of a selection of dishes from Nepal.< /Review>

<text>Love, love, love the food! We ordered a variety of dishes in order to have a sampling of flavors. I am absolutely in love with the fish curry and the Saag dish from the lunch menu. Good size portions and excellent quality. Raj, the owner, brought out a few other small items for us to try. Must say, I am completely impressed with my first meal here and plan to be back soon and often.<//text>< pictures>

Wonderful food. Everything is made fresh and you can tell. Its Indian with a twist which is done right. If you are looking for food from Napal then this is your spot. Mo-mo a few different ways and all are great.</Review>

Especially good food. We enjoyed talking to the waiter about their preparation. They just need to spruce up the decor a bit to match the quality of the food.< /Review>

You check in with a receptionist, and your name goes into the queue. When it’s your turn, one of the staff members behind the counter will call you up to purchase/ ask any questions about the product. Added bonus: as long as you have your debit card, you don’t need to have cash to pay. Great experience here!<//review></record>

Friendly staff that are happy to discuss the options on their menu with you. The staff always has suggestions to offer if you don’t know what you want exactly. Usually not a wait to get in. Require a valid ID to enter, so make sure you have one! Cash and Debit accepted<//review>

<time>1575751870408<//time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I was in SF visiting from Toronto, Canada recently and had the chance to visit The Apothecarium. What a great experience! We were buzzed in and greeted warmly - then given clear directions on the process and how to proceed. I registered by giving my name and ID, then we went in and waited to be called by one of the staff. Actually it happened so quickly that we didn't sit down, no long wait. I am a bit familiar with CBD products, but I have to say I learned so much more in this visit. The person we dealt with was extremely knowledgeable and very patient in answering all of our questions, and guiding us to the best products based on our needs. Such a huge selection of options to choose from. Appreciate the ATM available in store too. I bought a few things and have tried them all - great quality! The environment and service is very comfortable and approachable with no judgement - I felt comfortable asking anything and exploring options. I wish I'd asked the name of the person who helped us - he made the entire experience very positive! Definitely worth a visit and we will be back the next time we're in town. Thank you! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /Text>< Pics>

Highly recommend this dispensary. I’m big on customer care and knowledge of the products sold and this place exceeded my expectations. My wife and I had the pleasure of being served by Cesar who was very helpful, personable and understanding of the products we were looking for. I have ptsd and severe anxiety and he knew exactly the products that would be good for me and my wife who loves to get giggly high. We spent more than we expected too but we don’t regret it at all because this dispensary and Cesar deserve every penny. Haven’t had the chance to try everything we bought what we have tried is amazing. If you like a good Indica live resin cart you gotta try the Blueberry Cookies carts they are on point! 🔥 😌< /review>

If you’re coming here for the first time, you are required to make a profile so bring your ID! Also, if you’re new you probably will have questions. So DO NOT COME AFTER 8:45! The same people giving you excellent service are the same people that have to go home to learn more, tend to their families, feed themselves, and get rest.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1614131620578, 'text': 'Thanks Darien!

<Review>Awesome experience. Very ok prices and good buds.
First time in a US dispensary and really not disapointed. Fast onboarding , kind staff and a seller who really tried to get me the most appropriate bud (not even trying to sell me an expensive one).

As a european , i was used to Netherland coffeeshop and the experience here is way better<//Review>< pictures>

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\nBests,\nDerek Hunter\nGeneral Manager\ndhunter@apothecarium.com"}<//Response>< rate>

<Text>Horribly mannered staff. Do not go here. The staff at the front door is incredibly rude. Better prices and treatment by staff down the road at the Green Door.

Edit: Response by the owner is inaccurate. No attempt was made by management to resolve this issue.< /Text>< Time>

Great prices. Friendly staff.

I highly recommend this place. It's what other dispensaries should strive to be like.< /Text>

Very clean, professional and run like a regular nice, friendly neighborhood store. I wanted to try CBD for my chronic neck and back pain, and the woman who assisted me explained the options I had. Very nice!<//review>

<review>You need to become a member and provide written personal information. When the Fed's come looking for that info don't expect this outfit to do mire than roll over like a puppy.</review>< Resp>

Member's profiles are also how we manage returns, exchanges and our rewards program.\n\nHowever, the minimum for entry is just a valid government issued ID, if you don't want to provide written personal information you don't have to.

Sean is professional and friendly. I was referred to him after asking a friend about his window tint and wrap. The tint has a lifetime warranty too so you can't go wrong with Sun Dimmers.</review>

<text>It was my first time getting my windows tinted and they look great. I had the factory tint on my back windows and nothing on the front. They tinted the front as I wanted and they also put another tint over the factory to match the front. It was done quickly and for a reasonable price. Very satisfied with the quality of work they did< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
I requested a quote on Christmas Eve in the evening. I wasn't expecting a response until the 26th, but Shawn got back to me in a matter of minutes. He quoted me and we set an appointment. I went in early on Saturday and he already had 4-6 vehicles, he recommended a few styles of tint, told me when to come back to pick up my car.
He finished a bit earlier than promised and I'm really happy with how my car turned out. The tint looks really well done, and I will be back later to get some racing stripes on my car since they do that as well!

Definitely recommend going here, I will make sure to recommend this place to my family and friends.

*UPDATE*

I decided to reach back out to SunDimmers so I can add some stripes to my car. Shawn remembered who I was and we made an appointment to get the repairs done on Saturday.
Shawn called me on Thursday to see if I would be interested in getting the stripes done early. I was at work and didn't have time to drive there. Shawn came down picked up my car did the work and brought it back before my shift was even over. I definitely recommend coming here as they left my car looking amazing. Thanks for the help Shawn, I appreciate it!< /review>

Tinted my windows. Did it in roughly the amount of time they said it would. Tint isn't peeling, no streaks after 1 month. Great job!< /review>

< Review>
I had my windows tinted more than 10 years ago with Formula One tint that they had applied. Took this time to wear down the tint a little bit on the edges of my windows the way the window goes up and down. I asked Sean if he could do a warranty claim to retint my windows. He said he would check and did, with no questions asked, now I'm good for another 10 plus years.  I would highly recommend this company for quality product and above-average customer service.</Review>

Needed to tint my passenger and driver's side windows and these guys did an excellent job.  I'm very happy with the tint. It eliminated my arms getting fried all the time.  Also, they took me as a walk in and got right on it while I waited. Pleasant waiting area with air conditioning and comfortable leather chairs. Friendly staff!<//Text>

<text>SUN DIMMERS are THE BEST!!! Customer Service, Quality of Craftsmanship/Products, and Price went above and beyond to exceed my expectations and now I am a customer for life! I have always heard great things about this company from friends and a week before our neighbors got their car done and also raved about how great they are. It was getting warmer out so we called them up and got a price over the phone. They had a few cars ahead of us for the day so we called to their competitor who we went to before. This other company had no wait and said it was a great price and would match it. We arrive to this other company and the owner Junior was very rude and disrespectful to my wife and I telling us it would be a lot more because he misquoted the type of vehicle and the amount of windows. Junior's poor communication and lack of integrity was very disappointing because it wasted our time. I can understand one miscommunication, but not twice with two important details. Because of this issue and his attitude we walked out and went to Sun Dimmers and we couldn't have been happier! The car looked great and was even done sooner than expected! Thanks Sun Dimmers!!!</text>< pics>

<Review>I brought my Mercedes CLA 250 here to have my front windows tinted. The entire process took less than an hour. Elizabeth was friendly and broke down all the options available and they had me back on the road within the morning. The film held up nicely to the rain and no bubbles. I decided to go back to get my headlights and taillight smokes. Shawn was very professional and knowledgeable and helped me get exactly the look that I wanted. No bubbles on the  lights at all and looks amazing. The first week of driving the car after I got the smoke I noticed some minor damage to the gasket around the headlight. The damage was hardly noticeable and everything worked fine, but I am a bit of a perfectionist with my car, so I called them back. After calling them back Shawn insisted that I bring in the car so he could have the part replaced. If I had brought my car to any body shop to have the gasket replaced I would have paid a lot more than the gasket just in the labor. For the Mercedes CLA in order to remove the headlight you have to remove the bumper, so I could appreciate Sun Dimmers being willing to own this solution. This kind of professionalism is why I return to them and appreciate they quality of work. They really took care of me.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Wonderful job & great service! I had my first experience today with Sun Dimmers. The first thing that impressed me was their friendly, professional customer service and also how clean their shop is! My particular tinting needs included removing "old" tint (not a fun project!) and then re-applying fresh, new tint. I am extremely satisfied with the great job they did...as well as the competitive pricing! I highly recommend checking out Sun Dimmers for your window tinting needs.

< review>
I've been looking for a local tint shop for my 2008 Smart car to have it tinted and the service rep Rob was very friendly and awesome. Car was done in 2 hours as he promised and the work done to it was very good! When I saw it I had a HUGE smile on my face. I was shocked on how it looked on my car and what a difference a tint to the windows would do. The customer service is #1 at this place for sure. I highly recommend Rob and his crew to this place. Thanks guys!!!

*The one who came in with the '08 Smart car with Hello Kitty all over the place haha =D<//review>

We have been Kitzman's Culligan customers for about 10 years now, utilizing their water-softening service. We enjoy the ease of the service - since they take care of it for you by replacing the tanks as needed. Their customer service is fantastic! They are always so friendly and ready to help or answer any questions that I have. Thank you Kitzman's Culligan!< /review>

It was easy to set up a visit with your technician. He explained very well the water problem and made good recommendations. The installation went smoothly and deliveries of the filtration tank come on time as scheduled. I get a text message from Kitzman a couple of days before the next tank delivery giving me the option to go ahead or skip the delivery. Every month I get an email with the invoice with at least a 3 week due date. Great company!</text>

We’ve been customers for 5 years or so and have both the water softener system and the water filtration. We are very happy with the services. The techs that come out are helpful and courteous. We had a leaky sink that caused the auto shut-off to kick in on the under sink water filtration (as it should work) and I called for assistance. They were out later that day, quickly fixed the problem. I highly recommend Kitzman’s.<//Review>

The reverse water tastes so much better than tap water and I have often had guests tell me how much better my water tasted than theirs.
Also I have Culligan soft water in my house which makes my laundry softer, especially bedding and towels, and my cloths come out of the dryer mostly wrinkle free! I would highly recommend getting Kitzman Culligan in your home.< /review>< pictures>

Cheaper than most other places. Their machines take $5 bills which is great when you have 10 or more gallons to get. You can feed the machine for the next bottle while it fills, which saves time. Filling bottles isn't a great experience, but Culligan make it as painless as possible.< /text>

Living in Cambria where we know the water quality is not that good we knew we had to do something. We put in the reverse osmosis system along with the soft water and could not be more pleased. Water tastes great and our ice cubes are now perfectly clear as opposed to how they were before. Very pleased!< /Text>

We recently changed from Ready Fresh to Culligan after numerous problems and terrible customer service with Ready Fresh after changing ownership. We were so thrilled to call Kitzman Culligan who had a “real person” answering the phone and responding right away!   They cane the following week and installed the RO under the sink and water taste so good! There customer service is top notch!<//review>

Best customer service in the area. A live person answers your call and they are very knowledgeable and helpful. The tech called to confirm the day of the appointment and was on time. They are fair priced and pleasant to deal with. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

As long time customers of this service, we are never disappointed. Today we had to have a service person come to the house to deal with the reverse osmosis system. He replaced it, cleaned up his mess, and discovered the system was functioning poorly, after all that work. He tested our water pressure and it was low. We have reported that problem and will deal with it. Our thanks to Kitzman's Water for their service.<//text>

<Time>1595615292368<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>We've been using Kitzman's Culligan service for about a year now and couldn't be happier with it! Culligan has improved our lives in so many ways. First, to clarify: this is not salt softened water! It is highly filtered water, a big difference. We ordered it right after we installed new dishwasher (3rd in 6 years) and washing machines. Water here in Cambria is extremely hard, so we called Culligan to help our new appliances work better and longer. Aced that! Next, my skin. Dry, flakey, itchy and unhappy. We had installed shower filters already, which helped some, but Culligan's whole house filtered water system is worlds better and my hair is way softer and cleaner. Add to that the high quality, double filtered drinking water, and the now spot free stainless steel sink and faucets and life is good in our little domicle! Oh, i can't forget the service - Kitz-men are polite, efficient and excellent installers. No problem at all. Thank you Kitzman's Culligan!< /review>< Pictures>

All your specifics about your dishwasher, washing machine, sinks and faucets being cleaner and better are what we continually talk to people about in the community.  Culligan Water really makes a  night and day difference!  To be honest, I don\'t believe anyone would go without conditioned soft and drinking water if they knew what they were missing.\nThen your comment about how amazing the skin and hair improvement is so important.  Last and definitely not least is the water you put IN your body.  Great drinking water has too many quality of life and health benefits to list here.\nI will share your note with our staff.  Our Kitzman\'s Culligan company vision is "Improving lives through better water."  I am so pleased, and they will be too, that we are accomplishing that aim and improving your life!

< Review>
I was really pleased with how quickly Kitzman responded to the problem we had with our RO system that had developed a leak.  The RO system had been  installed by another contractor several years ago.  Dan arrived the same day as my call and expertly repaired the leak and tested the quality of the water which was in the right range.  All for a very reasonable price.  Dan also let me know that I could bring water samples into Kitzman in MB for future testing at no cost.  I could not be more pleased with the service call.< /Review>

Very soon after the request to get help getting salt into our storage tank, we noticed 2 more bags of salt left near the spa by our back stairs!  This has happened more than twice.  We have been unable to get them into the tank as it is too full and they will have to stay there until we find someone to help lift the bags up to the top of our water softner tank inside the laundry after it is low on salt.</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1501277393542, 'text': 'George,\nThat soft water shower is pretty great!  Many people assume a squeaky feel after bathing in hard water is clean skin, but it is really the opposite.  That sticky feeling (or squeaky) is a film of soap scum or curd that is left on the skin from the hard water and soap combination.\nWith soft water, the lack of hardness particles allows soap to suds up quickly with much less soap or shampoo and then and leaves no soap scum on your skin or hair.  So enjoy that great Culligan soft water, and we appreciate you choosing Culligan.\nRob'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>One of the better Oakland restaurants. Very straight forward. High quality. Beautiful restaurant. I don't think you could go wrong here. I'm not super familiar with Afghan food but it reminds me very much of Uzbek and Tajik cuisine<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I hadn't had Afghani food in a minute and we just moved, so I had no idea what's good here. This place did not disappoint. The lamb was tender, the rice was cooked perfectly and the sabzi was hit the spot. To top it off, the customer service was so kind and pleasant. I mistakenly ordered sabzi challow instead of sabzi challow with lamb 🤦🏻‍♀️ and they were totally fine fixing it on the fly and still kind when I dropped in to pick it up. I'll be back for sure!</Text>< Response>

First time I visited this restaurant but ordered takeout and food was horrible. No taste in the food at all and it definitely does not taste anything like Afghan Food I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone who would want to taste real Afghan food. Worst place i have been to for Afghan food. Poor Food Quality, Horrible Customer Service and Longer the usual wait times. For the price you pay it is not worth it.</review>

First time visiting this restaurant with the hubby. Very enjoyable date spot. Such a beautiful culture and great customer service experience from a sweet young waitress. The food was beyond my expectations. Great portions for the price. Very well made and great temperatures on the food as well. I had the lamb and brown rice (amazing combination) hubby had the kamdesh chicken special was terrific as well. Definitely loved the green tea and the doogh is a must! We will be back to try more of the menu. Great atmosphere and big area for group dining.</Review>

<text>Authentic Afghan food in a casual, airy space. Great for groups. Lamb shank is delicious, tender meat and savory rice with raisins and carrots. Prices run $12-15 for a plate. Try the green and orange colored sauces, the orange one has a strong kick!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_ZOv5nRyKsQ0dZ4Gv8PxHlwRYWSTIflenUdI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<text>Nice afghan place in Oakland. It was my first time in Oakland and found this spot. I was gonna try this place or the Maya taqueria place next to it.

The seating is nice. I love there is a musallah so u can pray salah (we prayed Isha here post iftar) that is worth 2 stars on it's own.

The food was okay. The brown rice tastes like basmati with color. Not much zing to the flavor of the rice. I ordered the beef chapli kabob plate

The chapli kabob was kind of small which was dissapointing (other places give you 2 big chapli kabobs). And they gave u a lemon slice and one grilled tomato(good steamed but no flavor in it)

For $14-15 a plate it wasn't worth it but I had to try it once and it was my only spot to eat at. But I wouldn't come back probably.< /text><Rate>3<//Rate>< time>

Great food and friendly service. In downtown Oakland, which might scare off a few timid travelers, but, all in all, I recommend visiting.

I ordered to go, and the host told me 20 minutes for the chicken breast kabab entree. It probably took 15, and I did not mind waiting. There was a big screen TV playing music video hits from the 90s (hello, BSB!), but I suppose that's better than nothing at all.

The space is large, and if you are dining in, there's an option to sit in a special area which appears to give a more authentic Afghan dining experience (no shoes, low table).

The food was cooked to perfection, of a good portion, and the spicy cilantro (?) sauce was heaven.

Room for improvement: Men's bathroom. Things were clean enough, in appearance, but there was an unpleasant odor. Be prepared.<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><text>The flavor of the lamb-fat brown rice is delightful also with the crispy cucumber salad. However, the pieces of meat are fewer the expected, given the price. I easily felt like there should have been double the portion, especially given the amount of rice that accompanied it, which was kind of comical.

The service could be better. I was surprised that a server couldn’t explain two items of their menu. I would also highlight that they don’t serve alcohol, and I wanted their beverage menu to have more options.< /text></record>

<review>Everything was extremely oily, and tasted like really cheap vegetable oil. We ordered a mix of dishes-- eggplant, squash, spinach, lentils, the bread stuffed with potato, and salad. Everything was overcooked. They forgot to bring the salad and when we realized this at the end we asked them to remove the cost from the bill and they put up a huge fuss. At any other restaurant they'd correct the situation immediately. The Afghani bolani sold at the farmers markets around the bay are much healthier, tastier, and cheaper.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

The lamb shank with raisin and carrot rice is my husband's favorite and the salmon kabob and mantoo are mine (with brown rice). The baklava and firni desserts are both really delicious.  The baklava are a little bit smaller than some other places but this case is definitely quality over quantity. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. Give this place a shot and you'll probably have a new favorite.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Not recommended at all!
They said food will take 5-10 minutes  it take 45 minutes not suitable for a lunch hour at all.
Service is slow and bad.
Every other khabab plate will come with 2 sides with bread, here they only bring a small salad plate to share between 3 peoples
And at the end the food didn’t even taste good!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Was referred to this restaurant by someone we talked to on the street, and was glad we followed through. We were very pleased with our meals. I got the eggplant, and my wife the lamb kabobs. The eggplant was slightly soupy (not sure if that's the style, or just leaving more to be desired), and the lamb kabobs didn't provide you that much in terms of the portion. As always with middle-eastern food, the rice is awesome and they give you plenty!

One meal I would love to have them do is a baked pumpkin with mint sauce on it. That would be really good.<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

< Review>
I stumbled onto this jem few years ago when it was a small hole in the wall restaurant. So happy to see it's growth without compromising the authentic food. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the beef kabob and lamb shank are among my favorites. The green sauce on every table is made in house and is absolutely delicious.

My only complaint is the slow service. Be sure to give yourself some extra time.< /Review>

If I want my friends to try Afghan food, I bring them to Kamdesh.

The decoration, the service, the food, all were great.

I suggest you all to try it out and see for yourself.

Be patient, the meal does take time to prepare.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x808f80b46356fa6d:0x6460a16c00d4ca1b<//gmap_id>< date>

I came here for a friend's birthday party. This was a completely new experience for me. I could not have been HAPPIER with the food. The meat was beautifully moist and there was so much flavor packed into each and every dish. I recommend their desserts and the lamb! I could eat that lamb for the rest of my life and be a happy person!< /Text>

Had a very enjoyable meal with several colleagues.  We came early for lunch since there were eight of us and were promptly seated.  Not being familiar with the cuisine, we had questions and the man who sat us did not understand our questions and went to get help.  That seemed to take a while. Eventually a woman came by and answered some of our questions as she took our orders. We then waited a long time for the food. While we were waiting the place filled up and we saw parties lining up.

Eventually, our food arrived.  There was only a choice of white or brown rice as a side. All the meats were grilled. Flavors were fantsstic and all of us enjoyed it. Prices are moderate. The length of time everything took is the major downfall.</Review>

I love the food here! The wraps are really good. The sauces are tasty. The new space, which is right down the street from their old place is really nice and airy. Went there a few weeks ago and it doesn't seem like they have as many customers for some reason. Their old place was always packed.<//text>

Tasty food. Can get authentic Afgan taste in their food. Only complaint is that they waiters checked on you way less frequently. They don't accept American Express. Overall experience was good. Keep it up.

I visited again for second time. Service was very slow. Had to wait long time for food to come out. No refills. Had to ask for sauce 3 times.< /Text>

Quabili Pallow is our go to here. A lamb shank that is braised to falling off the bone with two tone rice. One is a white rice that is covered with a saffron or turmeric colored rice then sprinkled generously with marinated carrot shreds and raisins. We share this dish.< /Review>

Afghan food is as variable as Afghanistan.  Restaurant has a variety pf authentic tasting food.  I went with a friend who was in that country and found it to his liking as I did.  Worth going back and just enjoying the food without any time pressures.<//Text>

Really great Kabab in downtown Oakland. A great place for large groups, I’d recommend doing family style to try a little of everything. I don’t know what it was, but we had a awesome Cardimon Pastachio pudding for desert. All in all, highly recommend.<//review>

<Review>I love this place. This is the first time I've ever been and I have to say the food was delicious!! The menu states that everything is made in house and is made to order which results in food taking longer to come out. The wait can be from 20 to 30 minutes so if your really hungry I'd suggest you order ahead of time.

The restaurant is quite big and open. Lots of tables, capable for large parties as well as more intimate meals. It is in downtown oakland so parking can be difficult, but there is a parking lot at the end of the block.

Lastly, the pricing is fair. Meals on average run from about $11-$15 which usually includes rice and salad.< /Review>< date>

Place is huge Nd feels like your in a huge hall. Good friendly and fast service.
Food was good. Can't complain much. Visit and enjoy some good Afghani dish.
Reasonable prices everything in the pictures with 1 tea came out to under $36.< /Text>

<Text>Love the service, the people are very kind and out-going. My favourite  dinner plate would have to be the kabili palow. Full of flavor and the salad on the side completes the piece. I like the handsome boy with the marines hat very nice and has a great smile. Overall great food and a nice lighting. Got to love it!<//Text>< date>

<text>Bad Service. The food does not justify the price. I ordered to go (brown rice with lamb shank) and they chopped almost the whole meat and left me with big bone and little meat (just a quarter)  plus small portion of rice for the price of almost $18. I believe the owner was not there and those people think they are smart bad they harm the business.<//text>< pics>

< review>
I ordered the kabob that came with rice and afghan salad. Im also an afghani who has been making these dishes since I was old enough to fold Mantu, but I found this plate disappointing. I asked them not to cook it well done preferring juicier kabobs, but it was so tough I, as well as my partner and son couldn't even take a bite from I without fearing broken teeth. Literally, it was even hard cutting it with a steak knife. The afghan salad was made cheaply because it just tasted like chopped onions with maybe three pieces of cucumber, no tomatoes, mint, lemon, salt, nothing. I ordered afghan bread naan and clarified I didn't want some pita bread you can buy at Safeway. But I still paid 3 dollars for tough pita bread and when I told her they made a mistake rather then exchanging it she handed me a bag with a tiny piece which was a rip off because I told her I was only interested in the naan. I mean I didn't tell her way later but immediately so I don't know why she did it like that. Mantu was pretty good but the serving was so tiny it was only enough for my 4 year old. I was really bummed and hope to find a good afghan restaurant around here. This was a waste of 27 dollars for 1 kabob plate and mantu. I get some white people may think this is a god send but I asure you, its not that great.</review>

<Review>It was an accident that we ended up here, we had planned to go to a restaurant around the corner that had shut down. Finding this was a real treat, the food was excellent. Portions are huge, two of us shared an appetizer, an entree, and an extra order of bread and it was plenty.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been a customer for three to four years and I have good experiences with them there food is really good but today I experienced an issue with the food...I order lamb chane* and they gave me old lamb chane* it tasted terrible no raisin in the rice like it usually would have! So I ate one bite and threw the rest away because it was terrible as said before:(</Review>

new and clean restaurant, slow pace service. Waiters will take very long to come to you, get your order, bring you anything during your stay but they will be quick to bring you the bill haha! they have very good food and icecream for example the orange blossom is a good ice cream.</text>

<Review>Delicious and wonderful service.  The room is really big and probably great for large events.  The Kadu was really good and the Mansion, was good.  I liked the spice on it as it was the first spicy version I have ever had.  Only downside was that used wonton skins that were just a bit too thin.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Excellent food. Family and friends go here often. Note that acoustics in the large space are such that it can sometimes be very loud, and difficult to hear members of your party if you’re at s large table. Not a place for conversation.< /review>

Delicious! We had the cubed chicken it comes with rice and cucumbered salad, and the Tutsi deal was very good (but they don't provide enough naan) but it's delicious on top of rice.</Text>

I've visited the place twice, the first when it was on the corner back in 2013 and it was amazing, this time wasn't. The waiter wasn't so nice for some reason and  the food was below average, but the rice was good. Order an Afghan nan but it turned out to be a plain thick piece of bread. I was disappointed bc my expectations was so high and I will never go there again.<//text>

Didn't get recognized for 15 minutes. The waiter would only fill my wife and I cups' halfway. Took another 25 minutes to get our entree and the Lamb Korma Chaloo was bland and mostly fat. I'm trying to figure out if I dined at the same place as the 5 start rating folks. :/<//review>

My favorite restaurant in Oakland, without a doubt. The quabili pallow is probably the best single dish in Oakland. Kabobs are bursting with flavor, great with the eggplant and bolani bread. Do yourself a favor and just try it.< /Review>

<text>This places is open, clean and welcoming. Our party arrived on the street that had 2 Afghan restaurants on the same street. We walked past the other one (which was dark and wasn't welcoming) vs this one here, Kamdesh. The menu items at the other place were a bit cheaper than Kamdesh. We were seated immediately and the waiter arrived a few mins later. She explained the menu items. We ordered the Qubali Pulai, Chicken Kabob and Beef dish. We also ordered an extrea skewer for $3.5. The food was plenty to eat for us and we took the extra home. The dishes were delicious and flavorful. This place was a clean restaurant to eat.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

If you've never had Afghan food, you need to try it! The flavors remind me of Indian mixed with Mediterranean. My go to meal is the mantoo (almost like dumplings), quabili pallow (lamb shank and sweet-ish rice, trust me on this), and beef kabab or kubideh. The food is always good here! Service can be hit or miss, but they will always try to accommodate you.< /Text>

Great experience. The restaurant was clean everywhere. Very courteous staff. Had the Mantoo, Turai Daal, eggplant borani, and quabili pallow. They even gave us a cucumber and tomato salad on the house. Food was excellent. Bread was slightly stale is my only knock.</review>

We're persian and Afghani food is one of the closest food to ours, so we tried different afghani foods in several states in the U.S. and I can say that this is definitely one of the best afghani food we've ever had.
The koubideh was particularly awesome, they made it even better than many persian restaurants, it was very well-done, juicy and delicious.<//Text>

<date>1500692372350< /date><Rating>5</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) The restaurant was spacious and organized and when I asked for food the waiter told me that my order was more than I needed and with me and I asked for less food as it was very tasty and unforgettable, I strongly recommend it.

المطعم وسيع ومنظم وعندما طلبت الطعام أخبرني النادل بان طلبي اكثر من حاجتي ومن معي وطلبت طعام اقل حيث كان لذيذاً جداً ولاينسى، انصح به وبقوة.< /review>< Pics>
