<text>Started going to help relieve lower back pain associated with/caused by pregnancy. I wish I would have gone sooner than 32weeks! After a few short weeks, my range of motion is getting better, I’m in less pain than I was, and I am not having to limit my usually activities as much. I’m grateful to have some normalcy to my activities again. At the end of every day, I couldn’t move my leg without significant pain in my back, making walking, twisting, or bending impossible. The adjustments and massages are working for me and making the end of my pregnancy more manageable and my quality of life better.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rating>

The Perrys are not only awesome but make it ever so easy and comfortable to receive care which is so important to us! When we first started seeing them we were an absolute mess. Now we are both avid travelers and have recently been able to hike our way right up the coast and into Oregon! It was amazing and we owe it all to the Perrys! Loving life again! We love u Perrys!!</Text>

<Text>The results are AMAZING. When I came to this office by back was in a lot of pain and now I have not experienced that pain I used to get. I am extremely happy that I decided to go to this office. The entire staff is so nice, since you walk into the office with the ladies taking care of check in through the entire adjustment process. They are very caring since they get to know you by your name. The office has a very positive atmosphere and I feel like they are always encouraging when it comes to the exercises that you have to follow up with. They take their time making sure that you know what to do when you get home so that your progress continues.< /Text>< Name>

I went in today to get chiropractic care, when first going in and filling out all the new patient forms I felt very welcomed and I felt like I was going to get help. I went into the back office to so see the doctor. And the moment the chiropractic doctor came in I did not feel as if I was accepted or felt as if they did not want to help. I could not afford the X-rays and that’s when I felt really judged. While walking walking me out, I could already feel unwanted, and the interaction of me leaving felt very awkward. Even when I have funds available I will not be returning.< /Review>

They provide excellence service. The girls at front always greet you as soon as you walk in. Dr. William and Stephanie helped get better after my car accident. I had a lot of pain on my lower and upper back, and also my neck. They also gave me some home exercises to recover faster. As an today I feel great!!! I feel like I have a new body!!! Good bless them all ❤️❤️❤️!!!< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Words cannot really express how grateful I am because of this place! When I first went to see them, I was in a bad position (literally). I could barely walk so I had to use a walker to lean on and even then it was painful for me. I was hunched over and towards the left and just in an awkward way. It was bad and painful.

Prior to my first adjustment, I was referred to PT for a mild scoliosis that my doctor noticed from an x-ray. I go to PT and there is where I find out I have diastasis recti so the pain I had been feeling were likely resulting from that. Let's just say that the couple of months following led to me being bedridden and in massive constant pain. Everything hurt all of the time - standing, sitting, laying, kneeling, etc.. so you can just imagine how much I dreaded having to use the restroom, to shower, to sleep (which I hardly did due to the pain), and was barely able to tend to my toddler (so thankful for family!). Enough was enough.

It was not my doctor who had finally referred me to a chiropractor (she was actually upset that the PT told me I had diastasis recti and that they could only do so much and recommended I see a specialist to really get to the source of my pain), but a nurse who works in her office who had been seeing a chiropractor. I'm so glad I listened to him!

I am months into my recovery plan and the improvements have been major. After a couple of weeks of adjustments I no longer needed the use of a walker. Maybe around a month or so I no longer dreaded moving around. I'm not fully recovered but I'm a helluva lot closer to it than when I started. I cannot thank you guys enough!

PS the staff is awesome. They're super friendly and nice. Very knowledgeable and understanding.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><user>105277262669210804215</user><gmap_id>0x80ea69935efa7fdb:0x8c65d6c2e7c2682</gmap_id>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I have been a patient for 2 years now. I initially went in for shoulder pain and getting regular adjustment has helped out immensely. What helped was getting my X-rays to see how what was truly going on in my body.

As I have been going regularly, my X-rays have been showing improvement.

When I do not go in and get my regular adjustments I can feel the difference.

I would highly recommend BFC. Great doctors and staff. And the new office is fantastic!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I have been suffering from neck and shoulder pain for years. I’ve been to several Chiropractors but it always made it worse. A friend talked me into going to BFC. I wasn’t too excited to try more chiropractic care, but I went. It was the only place that did X-rays before they did any adjustments. We came up with a treatment plan and within a couple weeks I had major results. I also get massages there and they are amazing. I haven’t had any pain. This has been life changing for me. Even if you’ve tried a chiropractor before and didn’t have good results, try BFC! You won’t be disappointed. Plus the people who work there are so nice. They remember your name and treat you like family.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Where to start? I originally called a week prior to my appointment to verify that they accepted my insurance. At that time the receptionist told me the first appointment was free and if any additional appointments were needed it would go through my insurance but any co pays would be covered by me. Figured out this was a lie after my initial consultation. I went in for my appointment on time and nobody was at the front desk. The sign at the desk stated they were in a team huddle yet I saw employees walking around, look at me and still not check me in. Receptionist did not come out for about 15 mins after my scheduled appointment. Both came out without masks while the majority of their clients were also without masks. Seeing as I am immune compromised I would have loved to be told about their anti mask policy before I went in. The receptionist that signed me in was a 20 something year old girl who thought it was appropriate to call me babe and hun. I am clearly around her age and seeing as I actually have experience in a professional setting I would never talk to a client the way she addressed me. I signed paperwork and was not told about any additional costs until I was already in the back going through the appointment. When told about these fees the lady said that this charge was only placed until they were able to verify insurance. I then get checked out by another woman who was nice at first but after pressing on my back and telling her about where I felt the pain she said “well yeah it is all attached” (In regards to my spine). Thank you so much for letting me know that my spine is connected. I certainly didn’t know that before you pointed it out. Like what?? The man that did the x ray was the friendliest there and I appreciate his help. That was all that happened in the appointment and I was told I would have to come back the next day to review and go over treatment steps. So they charged $125 (that I was told would be free) for literally nothing? And I have to come back for another fee that could have been covered in this initial appointment. I would have had no problem with these fees if I would not have been lied to. I called afterwards to verify if I would be refunded after my insurance was verified and the girl told me no. Apparently it was a new patient fee and they only charge insurance for additional appointments. Get your story straight! It’s ridiculous to be told the appointment is free, then told it will be covered once my insurance is verified just to be lied to again! Please for the love of god get an accurate line of communication going for your whole staff. On top of their blatant disregard for public safety and not letting me (an immune compromised young adult) know beforehand that they were anti mask; the scams are just too much. I would never come back and support a business this low quality! Fair warning and I will be reporting this.< /text>< Pictures>

My family loves Drs. Perry!!! We have been going to them for over a year for wellness and they have been great. I saw them before pregnancy, during pregnancy and postpartum. After giving birth I was having a little bit of jaw pain and after getting adjusted, I no longer have any pain in my jaw.

They serve people of all ages and adjusted my baby when he was only a few hours old. Their new office is open concept and their staff is so friendly and they go above and beyond!!<//text>

I have had back pain and problems from a young age.  I finally decided a chiropractor was the right choice.  The second session with the Perry's was painful but when I stood up I felt different.  I apparently had forgotten what it was like to have more lung room, see there had been a horrible pressure in my mid back for around 15 years and all of a sudden it wasn't there anymore.  It was amazing, I will be honest I was close to tears the whole drive home.  I am now 3 months into my correction and yes sometimes it still hurts to get realigned but afterwards I feel so much better.  My posture is improving, which means my confidence is improving, I don't have constant all day & night pain anymore, I can sleep, and do physical things that were harder before for me.  I still have a road ahead of me but thank goodness I found the Perrys.  They are fantastic.  Kind, quick, and friendly; really their whole team is great!!< /Text>

I literally do not have enough good things to say about this place. I seriously messed my back/neck up at work this morning and was in excruciating pain and could barely move or function. I work out at Edwards and the closest chiropractor office wouldn’t help me. I got ahold of the most friendly, personable and helpful front desk girl i have ever had the pleasure of speaking with. She got me in just in time for my hour and a half drive and explained the whole process to me. On the phone and in person she helped me as much as she possibly could due to the pain I was in. I got taken back quickly and examined/xrays and adjusted. All of the people that helped me from start to finish were beyond amazing. They were extremely helpful and very empathetic about the pain I was in. They we’re all extremely knowledgeable and explained everything they were doing and what they saw. I already feel a lot better and have way more range of motion from whatever I injured this morning  They are working with my schedule for future appointments and I am so looking forward to my future encounters with these amazing people! I am new to the area and so glad there’s awesome and helpful places like this one!</Review>

<Review>I originally brought my son (3 years old) in for flat feet. I’d previously asked two pediatricians for advice and both said to use insoles and nothing else could be done. We’re a few months in and I see a drastic change in my sons structure when he stands. His feet cave in much less.

The best result was unexpected. My son was having uncontrollable pee accidents and could only go in very small amounts, very frequently. With the pediatrician, we tested for everything possible even had an ultrasound done. Everything was normal and she told me he would just outgrow it. After the first week of adjustments I realized my sons accidents were now huge amounts. Whatever was adjusted fixed his problem.

Dr. Perry is great. He always makes my son feel comfortable and goes out of his way to do my sons adjustments how he feels most comfortable (sometimes on the table, mostly on the floor). I highly recommend Bakersfield Family Chiropractic.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Dr. William Perry is a truly amazing chiropractor!!!!! I was in Bakersfield from out of town and was desperate to get my back and neck adjusted. I googled local chiropractic care and went on a search and several practitioners were out of business. I called Dr. Perry’s office and they gave me a new patient appointment at a convenient time the same day. I have to say that Dr. Perry was refreshingly down to earth, warm, and personable. He gave me, without a doubt, one of the most impressive chiropractic adjustments I’ve ever had anywhere. I strongly recommend him to anyone looking for spectacular care. Heidi Taylor, PhD< /review>

I first went to my orthodontist and they recommended me this place. I had woken up with my jaw misplaced. It was open and I couldn’t close it what’s so ever. Once I came into the building I had to sign a couple of papers and within 5 minutes they had me take X-Rays after they took the X-Rays, they came in the room and popped my jaw back into place. Within less then 20 minutes of being there these people took really good care of me. Highly recommend this place for people. Thank you Perry for taking care of me when I really needed it.<//Text>

First of all I don’t know why someone would give this place a 1 star ignore that!

Second, this place is amazing!!!! I came and brought my son who was 1 month old (yes 1 month) to get him realigned I never knew about the benefits of chiropractic care until my friend who also had a baby told me about it. Growing up I never heard of it and especially not for my young son my family would say “O HECK NO”. However, I gave it a try! My son had Colic the doctor said and if looked up on google there is not a cause but servers and it’s hard to know exactly why? So, I took a chance to try to get some results because him crying for hours and hours was doing us both no good! I took him in and the first visit I noticed a change! It’s not like regular aligns for adults however, different it looks like a baby massage! Your baby will pass gas and feel relieved after! I have been coming for about 3 weeks now and I must say the results are amazing!!!! He has not been crying for those hours and he is calm! Now my little guy had some problems due to C-section. This was because I could not dilate more. That is the reasons for his tightness on the right.

I am very pleased with this outcome so I decided to come too!! And I am happy all of those hours burping are causing my back to hurt and that epidural!!!

My doctor is very nice and comforting. She listens and she is a good person! She has a family it’s is a nice setting you can bring the kids they have toys for them! I mean it’s sweet the people get to know you in the front office. I really enjoy this place:D</review>

Besides their professionalism, they truly want their patients to feel better and thrive. When I experienced a concussion it was their care that actually helped me heal. After the concussion, the adjustment I received helped me be able to focus and process thoughts again. The Drs Perry also care for my husband and helped him after his hip surgery. My children benefit e most as they are here for checkups due to falls and head bumps as well. We recommend Bakersfield Family Chiropractic to anyone who is in need of holistic health care, not just chiropractic care.< /Review>< rate>

<review>When I first met Dr. Perry, I was very impressed with his enthusiasm and professionalism.  When I described my lower back pain, he went the extra mile to test my hypotheses.  He took additional X-Rays, and explained my condition (a short leg syndrome) in detail.  Dr. Perry really made it his mission to find a cure for me.  After discovering that my left leg was 18 mm shorter than my right, he contacted multiple local cobblers who could make me appropriate shoes to correct my balance.  He did it in a timely fashion.  My health and my posture have vastly improved since meeting him.  I've had this condition for over 10 years and without Dr. Perry's help, I don't think I would have been able to beat it.  I highly recommend him.  He's very personable and in tune with your needs.  He's solution-oriented too.  Best doctoral care I've ever had.<//review>< pictures>

Bakersfield Family Chiropractic is the answer to my prayers.  During a time of desperation and uncertainty for the wellbeing of my 6-year-old daughter, I found Bakersfield Family Chiropractic by recommendation.  At our first visit, Dr. William Perry (The Kid Whisperer) examined my daughter and explained to the both of us, visually and thoroughly, the chiropractic approach to our problem and once reviewing the x-ray report, Dr. W. Perry, presented his plan. After only a month of chiropractic care, we began to see improvements in my daughter’s health.  I am truly grateful and blessed to have placed my daughter in the expertise-care of Bakersfield Family Chiropractic. Dr. William and Dr. Stephanie Perry are amazing chiropractors and people. They are knowledgeable chiropractors who are making a difference in the health of my daughter and through their intentional kid-friendly conversations, they make my little girl, Gracie, feel comfortable at each visit. We look forward to each visit as we know that it will always be a pleasant one.  Thank you, Dr. William and Dr. Stephanie, for helping my little girl on her journey to wellness . . . and also thank you for always listening to all the stories my “chatterbox” Gracie has to tell. (They can be quite interesting. =) )<//review>

<review>Mr. and Mrs. Dr. Perry are both amazing. I started going to them when I was 7-8 months pregnant. Getting adjusted helped with back and hip/pelvic pain so much. I went the day I went into labor and it helped increase the strength and closeness of my contractions. My new born daughter got adjusted when she was 2 days old-and every week since (now 3 months old). It helps keep her bowels regular and really helps her with her acid reflux. My husband, our daughter, and I get adjusted weekly. We love it. They keep our bodies functioning like they are meant to.</review><time>1521230473882< /time><UserId.>101442577012471257860< /UserId.>< Rate>

I literally look forward to my visits to the chiropractor. Both my 15 week old and I feel so much better after our visits. Dr. Will Perry is so great with our son! He talks to him and soothes him during his adjustments and I feel  very comfortable when my son is in his care. The staff are so friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Bakersfield Family Chiropractic to anyone looking not only for good chiropractic care, but for a chiropractor that will take the time to listen to your issues and concerns and address them with knowledge and professionalism. Dr Will and Dr. Steph are just great.<//review>

My experience with the Perry Family was amazing!
They are always very caring and optimistic.
I used to have problems with my back and neck, along with allergy and digestive issues due to pinched nerves, but visiting perry a couple times a week has really opened my eyes to the many benefits that come along with chiropractic care. Thank you!!!<//review>

I came to them with concerns of my son's neck and tendency to favor one side while nursing. After a few adjustments I noticed longer feedings on the side he did not favor. They are great with kids and I credit our health to their work. None of us have gotten any cold/flu since we have been patients(almost 2 years now).

I have struggling with vertigo for close to 17 years with many medical tests and meds but with little relief. I averaged about 3 to 4 bouts per year lasting close to a month. I told Dr Perry about this and he started to work on atlas/axis alignment while I was in a vertigo bout. His treatment reversed my vertigo effects and I was able to fly out on vacation!  I now visit him frequent to insure alignment. He is a fantastic man who cares for his patients. What a blessing.  😁<//Review>

<time>1458687331362</time><rate>5< /rate><review>I have been a patient of Dr. Stephanie Perry and her husband Dr. William Perry since October 2015. I had awful siatica pain during my pregnancy. They took absolutely the best care of me. I was seeing them 4 times a week towards the end of pregnancy due to the pain and every time they made me feel comfortable and listened. They also started adjusting my son who is 6. I have seen several chiropractors due to scoliosis and not once has my son allowed a chiropractor to touch him until we saw Dr. Stephanie Perry.  Now he looks forward to seeing her and being adjusted. His asthma has improved tremendously since he has been getting adjusted.

The day I had my baby Dr. Stephanie Perry made a house call to make sure me and my daughter were both in alignment after labor.

I can't recommend this family chiropractic team enough.  They are caring, thorough, and are very knowledgeable.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Personalized care with the "human element." I've been to countless Chiropractors seeking relief and Dr. Perry is by far the best one Ive been to.

Dr. Perry and Dr. Stephanie are amazing! They really pay attention to what is going on with you and are so warm and helpful. My whole family has improved health because of them! My youngest child , who loves to climb and therefore falls a lot, has been helped tremendously by their chiropractic knowledge. Dr. Perry has found a way to help my oldest child, who has seen numerous chiros in the past, that no one else saw needed help. And my middle child is very shy about getting touched and is finally allowing Dr Perry to check her. Thank you Drs. Perry! You are both so wonderful!</text>

<text>The day I brought my son Evan to see Dr Perry will be one I will always remember and be thankful for.

Evan is on the Autism spectrum. At the time we saw Dr Perry, Evan was in 3rd grade and on a few different medications for anxiety and ADHD. The side effects were way worse than the behavior they were trying to help.

As I sat and spoke with Dr Perry, Evan bounced all over the office, at times hitting his head against the wall. After getting an insight on what Dr Perry was going to focus on to help Evan, we started treatment. Evan felt more and more comfortable each time we went. He would even walk in alone sometimes!! It took a few months of regularly going 3 times/week and Evan has been off medication ever since!!

Evan is now in 7th grade. He is very smart, funny and is so full of life. My husband and I are forever thankful for Dr Perry!!</text></record></dataset><record>

Dr Perry and Dr Stephanie my Chiropractors are Amazing. I came in with incredible pain and a severely whacked out neck (my neck was curving the wrong way: it looked like a train reck on the extrays). In less than 6 months my neck has improved over 70%. Along with the rehab tools and amazing care there is hope for even more improvement!!!
So very excited!!!
Thank you
Doctors and Staff You are all Great!

My daughter has been on Miralax since she was 1. She is now 7. I have tried everything to get her off of it. Upt her fiber, more water, etc. Well,  I had the pleasure of meeting both Dr. Perrys'. We talked about the benefits of chiropractic for constipation. Dr. Perry did an assessment and told me her tailbone was shifted more to left.  He did an adjustment. This was a Friday. I had already taken my daughter off Miralax on  that Wednesday prior.  That Friday after two hours of seeing Dr. Perry, she had a bowel movement.  Again we went Tuesday and seen Dr. Stephanie Perry. She did an adjustment. This has been well over a month and a half and my daughter has had a bowel movement everyday without Miralax!! I've done the happy dance over and over again! I would have never thought in a million year's that a chiropractor would have helped my daughter's chronic constipation!  I'm a firm believer now! I will forever be thankful for them!< /review>

<Text>I've been to several chiropractors. I've been receiving in and off chiropractic care since high school. I have never had anyone as thorough as Dr. Perry and his wife Dr. Stephanie. They're great!!! I have my family of 4 under thei care and I probably will never switch chiro's again. They are absolutely AMAZING with my two kids. I love that they are a member of the icpa and I definitely trust and recommend them, especially for children. They also do amazing things for our community!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1490247006983, 'text': 'It is an honor to have the opportunity to serve you and your family!

Good service but overpriced. Great empanadas. For the cakes Mango is our favorite then Black Forest. Pitily dislike the Ube as they use heavily artificial color and flavoring. Butter slices cake are good too.</Review>

Almost always grab the mango cake here for a friend or family birthday. Needless to say, they are almost always delighted. There's a lot of different pastries here and though I haven't tried every single one of them the quality of the cake must hold some ground to the quality of everything else. Very tasty!<//Review>

The devil's food pre wrapped cakes, I think they are about 1.29 each are delicious.  They are very plain, taste great, and are moist.  Also, they do not have frosting for people who do not like really sweet, but they are really good.  I highly recommend trying them.< /Review>

<rate>3</rate><Text>Seems like it became very busy now this year. I am wondering why exactly but there was not a new meal but a few new cakes. I saw a new face. Many people were lining up to that cashier instead of the other one. The cashier seems very genuine and humble. Three stars for now until we get something new on the menu. We need the diniguan, lumpia, and more Filipino foods on the board.
What is happening? my google keeps refreshing. I already sent a review from my other account. I forgot, I'm too old for this.</Text>< GmapID>

I am very disappointed on my last visit. At Irvine Red Ribbon there is usually no employee or unattended then I came here to buy empanadas. The cashier made a mistake and punched in a wrong one. They don't know how to change my order and made me pay for both. Red Ribbon employees got to be kidding me.<//Review>

The menu prices are too expensive for a small proportion of food. The pancit palabok are usually dry. They need more noodles and more sauce. But the sauce has a charge besides Jollibee sometimes gives an extra gravy sauce without any charge. Red Ribbon is not a fancy bakeshop co-restaurant so why should the menu be too much.</text>

Lack of friendly and kind employees. There is an employee that I really like cause I always see her do her best and get as much done as possible. She would be cleaning the dining room and hurrying back to the cashier when a new customer comes in before they head over to the counter. We need more people like that. She cares about her customer by giving suggestions and she puts importance to us talaga. I saw her last week and today. She was taking my order and I believe it was her manager that just pulled her out of nowhere while assisting me to tell her something. She looked hurt. I saw the way she pulled her but she kept quiet. After, her manager stopped talking to her. I quietly asked, "Are you okay iha?" She didn't reply na lang and took my order. She's always so kind and humble. Na hurt ako noong na kita ko yun. Gosh ayaw ko lang yari yun sa anak ko. Iba nang usapan na yun!!< /Text>

Needs more employees
There can not be only one employee at the cashier taking over 12 people's order. There will be a long wait for many customers. I have seen such a fast work from one of the employee doing their best to get everyone's order and preparing food. She was trying to reach out to the other employee but I guess they were on break or something. You can not just let one employee do everything out in front. Cooking food in the kitchen is not that hard. I have worked in the kitchen before and i helped my coemployees out to prepare the food for them. It took me almost 25 minutes to get my two orders because they did not cook my food yet and the cashier had been waiting on my food after she had kept taking orders and preparing the utinsels even answering many customers' questions on the cakes.<//Text>

<text>Not the best environment. Lonely and sad vibes in this store. Needs more energy with the employees. The greetings are not energetic from most of the employees. It makes the store have negative vibes or lazy employees. There's a guy that works here always sounds lazy and doesn't even smile to his customers.< /text><response>None< /response>< userid>

<review>I was waitin in line and there was only one cashier but she was quick. A customer ahead of me that had her order taken was waiting for her last order. The supervisur o manager seemed very mean. The cashier got all her orders ready and was waiting on the palabuk party tray. The one cooking pala is the supervisur o manager bayun. Angtagal niya iluto. Took very long. Then another supervisur o manager came out and blamed the cashier. What the heck, bastos. Sabi eh, "Kanina pa ang palabuk doon!" Eh nakita naman lahat na kakalabas lang. sus aah loco mga head dito The palabuk just came out, poor employee being bullied here! Not good branch< /review>< user_id>

< review>
Incorrect opening hours on Google. They open at 9am and closes at 9pm. 2-3 times a week my lolo and tiya go to Jollibee for breakfast and my tiya always wants to go to Red Ribbon but it's still closed. They should open at 8am. Some people work by then or is tired to drive all the way back to Red Ribbon for breads, empanadas, cakes, or others. Bakeries should be open earlier than mid-morning.
I also had the same problem with the cashew brownies Patrisia. It tasted weird and did had a metallic flavor in it.</review>

(Translated by Google) In this place it snows and the cakes are delicious and I have been buying there for more than 30 years. And it follows the same delicious flavor and they grill many different things but always the same quality. 100 delicious

They're nice people, they charge less than Romeo's for bait, however they don't carry my preferred blend of cigarettes that I smoke and they don't ever have birthday candles.  If that changes I'll give them another star.<//Text>

Toni! Toni! Toni! Toni helped facilitate a rush order for my wedding. After a last minute fiasco with my tuxedo and shirt, I had to buy a new shirt and HAD to have it cleaned, starched and pressed in 24 hours. Toni was able to get it done just as she said. She’s also funny, caring and a joker. Mulberry’s Dry Cleaner has been my dry cleaner for years and I am now a loyal customer thanks to Toni. Thanks, Toni!!</text>

Mulberrys is so much more than a dry cleaning business, it is a warm & welcoming neighborhood shop that lets you know you're in good hands. Toni is an absolute stand-out as a business owner - she really cares, has a great sense of humor and ensures your needs are take care of. The alterations I had done were amazing. I am so glad to find this place in my new neighborhood!</Text>

Toni and Fernando were wonderfully kind and accommodating. Went here for the first time recently and felt like the process was smooth and easy. Appreciated the small business/family-owned "feel" that they had; will certainly be coming back.< /Text>

Their dry cleaning and alterations are top notch. They always ready when stated or earlier. Friendly staff. I haven't used pick up and delivery because I work down the street from them.</review>

<review>For the great service, I want to thank the dry cleaning store. I was dry cleaning a suit here, and it looked fantastic. I brought some silk shirts that needed some extra cleaning with some stains, and they repeated and brought them back to life. All the way to 10 ratings! Keep up with the good job!</review>< rating>

<review>I got the monthly laundry service thinking its a good deal to get pick up and delivery laundry service for 30 pounds of clothes for $60. It has happened twice that after I schedule the pick up, no one comes to pick it up and I have to keep calling them to ask about the status of my order. this time, no one is even picking up the calls, have tried so many times, the order was placed for pickup for yesterday. I have left messages on Instagram, emails, voice mails - no reply anywhere.
I know its getting hard for businesses because of the virus, but even when the virus wasn't here, it was the same deal, the only difference was that they at least picked up the calls.<//review>< response>

<Text>Toni is great. She is super conscientious, so that even when small spots get this she will give you a credit and put a rush on that you get your garments back in perfect condition.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I would give this place zero stars if it was an option.
After this place bought laundry locker everything fell apart. They completely lost my clothes and it's been 2 months of my constant following up, but hearing nothing. At one point the lady at the store sent out and email to the delivery team and the response that came back was "I have no clue. I SOLD the order the other week when clearing out overdues." VERBATIM. I still have the email to prove it. This was coming from Ryan Herran the "Director of Operations", he obviously know I was copied on the email. But clearly they don't take customer care seriously, and doesn't seem to be doing anything to solve this issue.
Do NOT use this service if you hope to have your clothing returned!< /Text>

Awesome service! I ask them to use bleach but they say bleach will damage most of the items so they don't use it at all but try other natural alternatives. Highly recommend because they truly care!< /review>

They deliver good service and the items I've brought there have all come back as clean as expected. For the value, however, their prices are outrageous. I dropped off a dress yesterday morning then picked it up today after 5pm; the cost was $25 for "quick" dress dryclean. I've used the regular turnaround time for other items and had similar frustrations over such a high cost. I will not go back again unless I have no other option.< /review>

Expensive prices even for SF,
-Lost a few articles of clothing so i called them which lead to a conversation saying the clothing had been returned to me based off their data. (which as previously stated it had not been)

They found it in the same day (after saying they didnt have them and it was already picked up) and relayed the message to me that it was the delivery driver at fault...</Text>

<text>I placed a second order with mulberry’s and they lost a blouse. No one responds to email support and the 800 number says wrong extension.

Many people in my building have complained of the same issue.

I am still waiting to hear a response.

Do not use mulberry’s.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The vintage shirts I brought you were in critical condition, and I was not confident anyone could undo the damage done by the second rate cleaners I had previously entrusted them to. However, when I picked them up from your storefront two days later, I was amazed to see my favorite shirts fully restored and reconditioned.

Following this very satisfying first experience, I brought you my 45 year old Harris Tweed coat. As I had previously been concerned about the process necessary to clean a garment as special as this classic tweed, It had not been done in quite awhile and the wool was sorely in need of both cleaning and reconditioning. Yesterday, I returned to Townsend Street to pick up my tweed and found it looked as great as the first day I put it on. Your staff not only cleaned, but fully conditioned my coat as well. I am truly grateful for the care and professionalism I found at Greenstreets Cleaners, and will trust my clothes to no one else.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>GreenStreets is the BEST dry cleaning service I've ever used! The first time I used them, I was blown away by their customer service. I signed up online and received a personal email from them (not a stock email)...a personal email from one of their employees, welcoming me. In addition, they made the first pick-up delivery so easy and gave me such peace of mind that my clothes would be taken care of. Customer service, peace of mind, and 5 STAR quality work, is what makes GreenStreets the best dry cleaning service in San Francisco.</Text><resp>None</resp><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

This is one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had with a dry cleaner. They stretched a pair of jeans of mine, I took them back, all they did was clean them again- that didn’t take care of the stretching. Now my pants have been under “investigation” for over a week and a half with no update. Everytime I call, they say they will call me back and it never happens. Worst customer service experience ever!

Update - they refused to take responsibility for the pants and blamed it on the “fabric”. Funny thing is that I had three of the exact same pairs, just in different colors and 2 were just fine. Lose a customer that would spend 200+ a month over a $220 pair of pants. Idiots.</text>

<Text>I was charged incorrectly for 2/4 items.  I had 3 (wool) sweaters and one dress and was charged $60.  Upon further inspection I realized I was overcharged $3 per sweater.  When I discovered this, the front desk staff seemed more annoyed than apologetic.  Will not be returning and would not recommend.</Text>< Response>

Best experience here. The staff were overly helpful and friendly when my rental car had a flat tire. Did an amazing job, very quick turn around, and did it all with a smile. Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Thank you!!< /Text>

Great place to get your maintenance done or new tires. The Goodyear nearby hikes their prices up and close suspiciously early.<//Text>

<Review>I recently bought work van to start a business for myself. The van did not pass smog and needed some smog repairs. After failing the smog test, I immediately drove it to Midas, because I am still rather new to the West Side, and I haven't used any other mechanics in this area. I assumed that Midas was qualified to do the repairs...

I explained my situation to David at the front desk, and he reassured me multiple times that everything would be taken care of. I was very clear that I needed the vehicle to pass smog, and that smog repairs were my only reason for coming to the shop.

The following day I received a call from David informing me that the van had a couple check engine lights, one for a MAF sensor and another for misfires. He explained that the vehicle had not received new spark plugs in a long time and was probably misfiring due to needing a tune up. He convinced me to spend a few hundred bucks on a tune up and said I would be good to go. They also replaced a MAF and something else... After it was all said and done the repairs were just under $700.

I take the vehicle to get the smog test done and it fails again. I immediately call Midas and they assure me that I have not driven the van enough to reset the monitors, and to drive the van 60 miles, then I will be good to go. So I do this, then take it back to Midas and have them check it again, and it is still showing check engine lights. They tell me that I still have not driven the van enough, after I drove it close it 100 miles. So I drove it another 75-100 miles and brought it back again. The check it again and the check engine light still wont go away.

David recommends me to LARSENS AUTOMOTIVE (best thing that came out of this whole experience, highly recommend LARSEN AUTOMOTIVE)

I go to Larsen's and wow, what a breath of fresh air. I cannot even begin to explain the difference in quality of mechanics, service, and expertise. The guys at Larsen's really know what they are talking about. The first thing that they told me at Larsen's is that only CALIFORNIA CERTIFIED SMOG REPAIR STATIONS should be doing the work. Because if it does not pass, which it did not, the repairs must have been done at a certified shop in order to have the Smog waivered.....

WOW. Thanks a lot Midas. Now the $700 I spent is worthless to the DMV because you are NOT CERTIFIED to do smog repairs. I must spend another $650 at a CERTIFIED smog repair station...Larsen's informs me that because I already spent the money, my best option would be to see if Midas can complete the repairs and get the vehicle to pass smog.

Larsen's preforms their own diagnostic test and explains that the problems causing the vehicle to fail the smog test were NEVER properly diagnosed or addressed, and that all they did was do a tune up and call it a day. Larsen's had a very clear understanding of the problems and what steps needed to be taken to resolve them.

I went back to Midas with this information and they agreed to look at the vehicle further. After several days they called me to explain that they had given up. They were unable to solve the issues and were not going to continue working on the vehicle.

They then returned the van to me with less than 1 quart of oil in the engine. When I asked about this the mechanic explain that he checked the oil, so it must have all leaked out. So I asked him if he had a puddle of oil anywhere with 4 quarts of oil on the ground, but he said no. So I am not sure where he thinks 4 quarts of oil disappeared to between the time he claims to have checked it and the time they gave it back to me. (Grade A mechanic)

So here I am now stuck with a van that will not pass smog. It still needs over $1k in repairs, and the DMV will not waiver the test because the repairs were not preformed at a certified repair station.

Thanks a lot Midas. I will be pursuing this is court for misrepresentation.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Woke up to the fun surprise of my battery being dead. With a Mercedes, these things can easily be costly - called around for quotes. These guys had what I needed in stock, with a great attitude and great price! AAA recommended them and it was absolutely a great reference.< /text>

I came here about 2 weeks ago for an oil change. They were very nice and showed me how much oil I had before and the clarity of it . They they showed me how it looked after. There wasnt much of a wait when I got there. I like how I didnt even have to get out of my car. In 20 mins I was out the door. I really like this place. I think I would come back.</Text>

<Text>I stumbled on this place by accident, and after my second visit I can say that I'm lucky I did.  They explain exactly what you need and why, for example they repaired rust on my wheels so that my tires wouldn't lose air rather than trying to sell me a whole new set of expensive tires.  They know that like any neighborhood business, the return customer beats the rip off.</Text>< pictures>

<text>This place does a whole lot more than just brakes, I took my car here and ended up needing more than what I had come in for and the team took care of everything and when they said they needed to keep my car for an extra day longer than they had told me at first they offered to rent me a car for the extra day and pay for it completely out of their pocket. Amazing service never heard or another mechanic doing something like that for a customer< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

They did their job and did it quickly. Got the tires rotated and the oil changed during one of their sales but wouldn’t go back to get work done unless it was an emergency and I was broken down, they are way to expensive for maintenance. They quoted me $200 to change the spark plugs, something I can do for $40-50 myself. But for the oil change and tires being rotated on a sale this place was a-okay.<//Text>

They took care of me at the very end of the evening. I had a wood screw in my front left tire. They were reasonable and thorough as they checked all my tires for nails. I recommend them! All I needed was a patch and they didn't try to sell me a new tire.<//text>

These guys know what they're doing! seriously. I have had the brakes done multiple times ( at other various places ) and didn't realize the subpar job they did until now.  My brakes have never felt so tight and smooth.  The brakes used to rattle over bumps, other places told me I just have to get used to it or it wasn't the brakes at all ( which I knew it was ). Feels like they re-did my suspension now, no rattling, zero squeak, seems like less brakes dust too. Pleasure to drive! Thanks Midas MDR/Culver! 2006 Scion Xb<//Text>

I made an appointment on Line 9:30-11:30 I get there because no body call on send email i get ther the guys say he call I see a 1800 number on my phone but he leave no message.the tire I need is not Instock. If I want the tire I have  the option of later that day or tomorrow. I told him why he didn’t leave a message . His answer I don’t have time for that. How was I supposed to know all this information if he doesn’t leave a message. I moved things around because I supposedly I had an appointment on line it said the tire was in stock. If would of just leave a message I could have know made the time for later. Not only that on line they give me quoted he is tarting to rise the price but the worst is his attitude he was like take it or leave it.<//Text>

Highly recommend this shop. Braulio was professional, knowledgeable, and KIND. We arrived after the shop was closed in desperate need of help (our car started breaking down on the drive home to San Diego and no other shop would help us (everyone told us they were closing soon, or wouldn’t help. Costco down the street was the worst). Braulio immediately and kindly helped us, diagnosing the problem, and getting us on the road again in no time. THANK YOU!</text>

< review>
I went to this location with a coupon hoping for an oil change. They quoted me $89.99 for an oil change -reason: because my car uses synthetic oil. I was never going to pay that amount! We negotiated down to 59.99 but who knows if they put some regular oil in my car or the correct oil. It seemed sketchy to me, and a little sexist as I was a lone female walking into an automobile shop. I felt like he tried to take advantage of me and tried to make me pay a higher amount. Not okay and would NOT go back!<//review>

BRAULIO SEPULVEDA. I applaud you!!
I was just told my estimate. It was much more than  could afford. Instead of just shrugging his shoulders at me, this wonderful gentleman took the time to go on Amazon Prime to see if he could get the parts at a discount. Believe it or not, HE DID!! The total cost, almost half !
Thank you again, Braulio  from a grateful Senior Citizen.</text>

You are lier. You guys are posting your time on google map that you open at  7:30. Its 8:10 now and nobody is here. I just see one staff here arrived and I asked him about timing and he, without apologizing me for beeing late or aporoaching me with greetings, said upsetly, we open 8:30. I drove all the way from inglewood about 30 minutes but nobody is here and store is still close. Its such a terrible experience I have ever had.
Please improve your service.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>dont trust these crooks. while getting an estimate for my shocks and struts the guy with green eyes attempted to fool me. He did the oldest trick in the book of trying to tell me that I needed an oil change because I had no oil in my vehicle. thats a straight out lie because I do my own oil changes. He proceeded to act like he was putting the dipstick into the hole and back out to show me that it was empty. He told me to stay back so I wouldn't see him put or not put the dipstick into the hole. I decided to get the work done somewhere else where I got it $300 cheaper from a Japanese guy who's Better Business Bureau plaque seems the more comforting since he wasn't trying to just do an oil change. beware of the guy with the green eyes. I still have the estimate papers as proof. stay away from these crooks< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I liked the ease of useing a kiosk and rrally love the option to save my key digitally.

Only thing i would say is that the cost per key is kinda high and the copies i got felt like they were made from a very lightweight material.< /Text>< Pictures>

So far, only one of the three keys I made had a bit of trouble on its first use but worked fine when I tried using it again.
I love the almost contactless operation, no face to face encounter in a crowded hardware store. It was just me at your kiosk in a wide open area.
On a side note, my partner whom played in a rock band long ago, loves the Fender Stratocaster shaped key, it is her second favorite guitar after the Wes Paul.</review>

So the overall experience was very fast however there’s Any scooter or motorcycle keysAvailable hopefully soon you guys will get the motorcycle keys in there if possible because that would be awesome little pricey for two fobs I think I paid $40 but I got them right away only in the plastic white key though that you guys I guess only stock at the kiosk it be nice to have the other ones available so it will be more to choose from but all in all great experience they both work<//Review>

I would have rated it 5 stars if it wasn't for the price of the keys. It was real convenient and actually went relatively smooth get my house keys copied.  The location was hard to find too but after speaking with there operators they assisted me very swiftly and respectfully. Just a little expensive 17 dollars for 2 copies I'd still utilize and recommend there kiosk<//text>

<text>The key cutting was relatively quick, definitely easy, but the keys didn’t actually work on my lock.

After a closer look, the peaks and troughs of the cuts slightly off.

I called customer service, and they offered me a coupon to get new keys, but I just asked for a refund and they said sure. They were very easy to deal with.</text>< Pictures>

Quick and painless. The correct entrance to Bed, Beth, & Beyond was a little hard to find since there is one on both sides of the parking lot. When coming in from the street, it's the entrance to the far left.< /Text>

Like some other reviewers have mentioned, this kiosk is faulty. I had 2 keys duplicated and neither work - the duplicates are slightly off and won’t work for my locks. Hoping to get a refund, but surprised they haven’t fixed this!</Text>

They keep changing their prices. This time they wanted $8 for the first key! That is INSANE!

Went to professional locksmith, down the street, at 7th (Mainline Security) and they knocked it out for $3.80< /review>

I've been here about 4 times now and this place has become my go to bike shop due to friendliness, nice vibes, and helpfulness. I actually bike ride a few extra miles and pass by 3 or 4 other bike shops just to get to this one. They've helped me with everything from full repairs, small bike checkups, taught me little tips to improve bike maintenance,  and suggested great accessories that has made riding safer and more enjoyable. Definitely will be coming here throughout future years.</review>

<Name>Brandy Mendoza< /Name><Text>The customer service we received from Sheema, and the rest of the crew, should be the idea blue print for what customer service should be. Although we showed up at 5:15 pm, they close at 5:30, they were more than gracious and willing to fulfill our order as we bought three cruisers. I got a sea foam green, my brother in-law got a sweet silver, and my husband wanted a specific bike not yet on the floor, or even existed, yet they made it happen. At this point, they had already closed and were still willing to go above and beyond to make their customers happy. I truly appreciate the service we received from this one of kind establishment.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< user>

<Review>We had a big group of 9 rental bikes for one day. They only gave us 5 bike locks and one did not unlock and we waited an hour for someone to come unlock it. Then we barely had any time left to actually bike on the beach. When we got back they did not do anything to make up for their mistake. This was especially disappointing since it was my little sister's Bachelorette party and we would not be returning any time soon. There was not even a single apology from a single employee.

They will get the job done eventually but not without some brain damage along the way and it still may need some fine tuning elsewhere.  Specifically, I called and asked about the status of my bike, and they said they couldn't find it and reminded me there is a similar shop on grand.  Well need I say more?  Repairs seem ok.  But I need a new chain still, they won't help me, they are done.<//review>

Unfortunately some parts have been out of stock and on backorder for 6 months. We have over 50 bikes in for service and have 2 full time mechanics trying to get everything done in a timely matter. Keep in mind we've worked every day since the shut down and some of us even contracted Covid at the shop trying to serve our community. There's a lot of hurdles we've had to jump over the last year and those continue today. Thanks for your business."}<//response>< GmapID>

Popped in, knew what I wanted and bought an electric bike on the spot. Jay was knowledgeable and helpful. A year warranty and lifetime "tune ups" for  free, those were just extra perks for the price I paid.</review>

I stopped in to have some minor repairs done on my bicycle chain, and learned that I needed to replace the entire freewheel and the chain to make it work right, more work than I first thought.  Then while my bike was on the repair stand so Dustin could check it out properly,  the back tire spontaneously blew. Nice!
Luckily they had all the right parts at the shop, many have no parts at all right now.

Dustin was kind enough to drop what he was doing and make all the repairs in just a few minutes. I was able to ride it home after all.
My bike has never ridden so well, it feels like it’s brand new. Shima was also working and she too was extremely helpful in getting me out the door in a timely manner and in the most economical way possible. I can’t say enough about this shop, I will be back for any and all of my bicycle needs moving forward. Dustin and Shima saved the day.

That said, if you stick around long enough to get seen and helped, the people here are nice and the services are fairly priced. Scott helped me today, and I appreciate the time he took to answer my questions. The work they did on my bike was nice and fast, too.</Text>< UserId.>

<Text>I brought my 8 year old road bike in for a tune up as it needed one badly since I neglected to properly care for the bike. A lot of work nee+to be done and Chris handled everything, there were problems with the chain and he did a bunch of extra stuff to get everything working properly, I can tell he is the kind of guy that refuses to deliver anything but a great service. Now my bike is riding like a dream after all the years without any maintenance, highly recommend and I'll be back for sure. Thanks, Chris! 🚴<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

As I'm riding away, the gears already aren't spot on!
So I go back, they give it a quick adjustment, and I'm off again.
Before I get home, the bike's gears are already not working correctly, now worse than when I brought it in to begin with!?

Rented some cruiser bikes from here recently.  Fair pricing for all day and flexible policy if we decided to keep overnight.  If you decide to rent cruisers make sure the chain is tight.  One of our bike's was not and the chain kept falling off which made for a frustrating time.</Review>

Love these folks, and the way they operate, unlike some of the other shops in the area- Clean, nice, honest, fair, and such a delight to have those business ethics in Pacific Beach.  Beware some of the other operators in the area are kinda lame. They have good service and skilled technicians and go the extra mile for the clientele, there are many choices in Pacific Beach and this is my favorite in the area hands down, I would go as far as to say look no further, if they have what you want.< /review>

Was very impressed by their bikes and the especially the staff. Everything was top notch and professional. The best we came across while we were in town for vacation. I couldnt imagine doing SD with the family without stopping by here. A GREAT way to end our vacation!  Thanks again Pacific Beach Bike Shop!<//text>

Great and honest service from everyone on the team. Very helpful in getting you up and running, and not pushy or sales-y in any way. The staff stands behind a fun lifestyle and great product, and are great at just treating you like a human being, and not just a customer. Roger was awesome to work with, and I happened to see him around town the other day as well! Instantly remembered me even though I hadn't been in for a few weeks, asked me how the bike was riding, if I had any issues; all that jazz. Being told you guys are there to support riders is one thing; actually living up to that inside (and outside!) the workplace is certainly another. Glad to have such an awesome shop in the community.<//Text>

Let me start this off by saying my first visit there was absolutely amazing. Very friendly very knowledgeable very helpful. Bought a brand new bike and a basket. Got to ride it two times and had for a total of 4 days and one of the tires went bad. Brought it back in to get it fixed and they still charged me for replacing a tire. Stressed to the point that I just got this bike and it was nothing we did to the tire. But still had to spend the money to get it replace. The right thing would of just replaced it for free. He knew I was not happy about. Was very unhappy leaving and annoyed.<//review>

I've been coming here for years. They're always friendly, super helpful (usually take care of stuff right on the spot) and reasonably priced. I also happen to like their low to medium end cruiser options compared to the other shops in the area.< /Review>

I looked at the bikes they had built in the shop and they had a great selections of different colors.  I wanted something different and after speaking with Tess she said that she could customize it.  Once the bike was finished I came back to pick it up and was in LOVE!!  It is better than I ever imagined!  I brought it back up to the bay area and get compliments on it all the time!

If you are looking to either rent a bike for the day and cruise around PB or looking to purchase a new bike you are a fool if you don't check out this bike shop!!

They did a perfect job at a price that was so reasonable I felt a little guilty paying the bill.

On the way home I realized the bike also received an overall tune-up.
That's the sign of a professional mechanic who cares about his customers and takes pride in doing a super job.

This is the 3rd time I've used this shop. Needless to say I'll be coming back if the need arises.< /Text></record>

My older road bike had a few issues needing repair, so I stopped in on a weekend morning with the intention of dropping it off and renting a bike to use for my ride later that day. I was pleasantly surprised when Tony said he could take a look at my bike right away. An hour later it was tuned up and ready for me to take on my afternoon ride!

Tony also recommended some additional repairs which would improve my bike in the long term, so I brought it back the following week for these to be completed as well. Now my bike is running better than when I initially purchased it!

Everyone in the shop is friendly and the service can't be beat. I'll definitely be returning here for anything I need in the future!< /review>

Awesome shop with a great owner and excellent staff. I live in Texas and I contacted Pacific Beach Bike Shop late last summer because I was going to be out in California for Ironman Superfrog in September. Right out of the gate, Scott was eager to help me make it a successful trip and even better race. He set an appointment and then followed up several times prior to my arrival. Once the bike landed, his tech had it assembled within a few hours at very little cost to me. When I get there to pick it up, bike tech tells me he tuned it up at no charge. Had a solid race and dropped the bike back off that afternoon. Tony's team disassembled the bike and got it back to Texas within days of my return. My bike is the most expensive piece of race equipment I own and Tony's team really put my mind at ease.These guys saved me a ton of money and treated me well even though there not my "LBS". Five months later, Tony the owner tags me in a social media post and we've exchanged a message or two. I've dealt with multiple bike shops and its rare to find one so engaged with their customers. Top Notch shop. Thanks Tony, Scott, and everyone else out there for taking care of me.< /Text>

I bought a 3-speed Beach Cruiser here in October and I gotta say that this Bike shop is awesome. The main selling point for me was their policy of free tune-ups when you purchase a bike there. Being so close to the ocean with the sand and salty air, really messes with a bicycle so it is awesome to be able to go into the shop and get everything lubed up and tightened without having to spend cash every time.

The service is outstanding. Scott, Tony, Kristy and Roger (I'm sure there are more, but these are the employees who I've dealt with) are really helpful, know what they are talking about and always professional. I had an issue with a tire they got me in and out super quick and they stood by there product with absolutely no hassle.

I've purchased a couple cheap bikes at other shops here in PB and they've all fallen apart.  The chains and wheels rust out really quick. I'm happy I found a place that is interested in building a solid clientele that keeps customers coming back with good service rather than nickle and dime-ing their customers every time the bike needs an adjustment.<//review>

Looking for a beach cruiser in PB can be a pain. Pacific Beach Bike Shop made my experience so easy. This is the best place to buy a bicycle in San Diego hands down! I got a custom beach cruiser and might come back for a fixie. The guy that helped said they could do service on my road bike for cheap and got bike rentals for only 15 bucks a day.</review>

< review>
Awful. I picked out 2 bikes for my wife and I for Christmas and went today to purchase. I also needed an infant seat I purchased online to be installed on one of them. Christy and Brandon were working. They both have blah personalities but I can deal with that. They told me it would take about 30 min to install the infant seat and swap out the wheels and adult seat for the colors I requested. It took an hour but, again, I can deal with that.

When I came back and looked at the bikes I noticed the one the infant seat was installed on had a scratch and dent. I pointed it out to Christy and asked if they had another white bike to swap it out for. She said yes and stated, "I guess we should have looked at the bike before we installed the seat." I agree. But she said it as though it was my fault. Then she walked off to help another customer. And I was just standing there. Cause you know, its my fault the bike they were about to sell to me was damaged. Totally my fault.

As Christy was off helping another customer, Brandon was busy on the computer right next to me. When I say busy, I mean very busy. Too busy to acknowledge me standing there with my thumb up my ass waiting for someone to do their cussing job. So I reached out for help and asked if they could swap out the infant seat onto the other white bike (the NON-damaged one, cause you know, that's what I'm paying for). He said it would take about 30 min. But because he was SO busy on the computer he didn't look up to actually engage in a conversation with a customer spending $500 on their SERVICE. So I walked outside to take a breath. When I came back in Christy wasn't busy anymore so I asked if she could swap out the seat. She said, "oh, I didn't know you wanted to swap it out." Seriously? I'm not buying a brand new bike with scratches and dents. I can go to walmart for that.

I asked if she preferred I could just take my business elsewhere. She said no, and wheeled the bike away to swap it out. Then she said she'd call me.

I drove home and sent my wife to pick them up. Because I honestly have never in my life felt so disregarded while patiently waiting to drop $500 of my hard earned money. My wife was also super disappointed with their customer service. Christy had the nerve to say "it was just a small dent." Seriously? When my wife got pissed, Christy tried to make up for the attitude by stating how she swapped out the color of the tires for us. Ummmmm, pretty sure that's your job. Still doesn't make up for your piss poor customer service. So we chose not to support this business.

The reviews all seemed so awesome. I was stoked to take my business here. You know what's sad though? They still got my business because they forced me to pay for the installation of my infant seat. Which I took home NOT installed on a bike.

The sad part? We LOVED those bikes and they aren't easy to find. The super sad part? We won't have bikes for our son for Christmas because we wasted our only day off dealing with this shop. Sad face.< /review>

Well stocked student bookstore great prices on some of the products. Profesional staff courteous, and efficient.... The stock of paper and cardboard for art projects was messy and the prices and descriptions were missing. I'll rate them 5 stars after they correct that situation.....< /Review>

<Text>Predatory book rental program designed to make its students pay FULL PRICE for inflated textbooks--text books that are hundreds of dollars. it's packaged information that is otherwise freely available online. Their staff is very condescending toward students and student complaints. Don't give your money to them. GET YOUR BOOKS ELSEWHERE, don't support this predatory business!</Text>< pics>

<Review>The staff were absolutely lovely and kind, but unfortunately, the doctor wasn't. I'm not sure if he was having an off day or what, but his bedside manner wasn't very understanding or welcoming. Will be finding a new vet to go to.

Edit:
(Disclaimer: This was originally a 3 star review)
Upon contacting another vet, they asked me to get all of my dog's current medical and shots records from Summer Hills. I called them 4 days before the new vet visit to ask to be emailed said paperwork, to which the lady on the phone agreed to do, but never did. This was all after she asked to know the reason for why I needed the information and if I was going to a new vet... I explained the events from the visit with Dr. Davis and how the visit made both my dog and me very upset. The lady then said she would need to tell Dr. Davis the reason, but would send the information to me. It almost came across like they were punishing me for having an issue with the vet, so they figured they'd make me sit on pins and needles waiting for them.
The day before the new vet visit, my husband called and asked for the paperwork again, but was met with rudeness from the lady on the phone. She eventually sent the email, but I just don't understand why it needed to be this much of a circus act in the first place. This was such a disappointing experience.</Review>< Pics>

Awesome folks that are very polite and professional. I enjoy bringing my little loved ones here. They're very good at helping to calm both you and your pet's anxiety. I always feel comforted when I bring them in for a check up. No one likes going to the doctor. But they make it easy and enjoyable. The head vet is very calm and patient.<//Text>

<Review>We initially got blood work done here and paid the visit fee, plus blood work fee, and was told we could get the extractions done within 6 months. We drove 3 hours to this vet because this is where I use to take my dogs prior to moving out of the area. Received a call 5 days before my dog's scheduled teeth extractions, they were asking to reschedule and then said they would not honor their original quote because it was only good for 30 days. We are changing vets.... paid them almost $200 and afterwards they raised the quote several hundred dollars just 5 days before the scheduled surgery!</Review></record>

In my 12 years of being a pet owner and using various vet practices around Sydney I have never come across a more caring and dedicated team. The kindness and consideration they have shown my fur babies just blows my mind. Each and every member of staff have been nothing but kind and generous with their time. They treat every one of their patients and owners as a member of family. I cannot articulate how grateful I am to this team of hard-working professionals.Thank you so much for the time and effort you put into your work. You are a wonderful bunch of humans. Juicy and Harley love you guys.</review>

<review>This is my first and probably last review. If you are looking for a vet with compassion, this is not your place. If you are looking for a vet to talk to you in a very condescending way, this is your place. The customer service here is not friendly except for Eslinn. The lesson I learned is convenience is not always the best way to go. One last warning, do not ever question the great and powerful Dr. Davis.</review><Gmap_id>0x809adf7c06e22b91:0xbb8f7c1c82861d7f<//Gmap_id>< user_name>

I almost never write a negative review, but this place has given me one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.

We "inherited" an elderly dog, Bella, from friends of ours who could no longer keep her.  We mostly took her to make sure she was looked after and had a good home.  She came with some medical conditions we didn't expect.  One of which is she accidentally pees while she sleeps and has difficulty with urination while awake.  Our previous vet was able to help our dog with some prescription medicine we give her twice a day.  About once a year she needed a $50 check up to make sure there weren't any complications.

After we moved we needed a new vet.  Summer Hills was right down the street and had okay reviews.  My first experience with Summer Hills was them pressuring my wife into over $500 in other expenses when she took her in for a $50 check up with heavy handed scare tactics.  Expensive (not the normal) blood test, heart worm medication, urinalysis, etc.  They implied that if she didn't purchase these the dog could die, and pushed the guilt pretty hard.

I called and told them that was not what we wanted and they needed to cancel all the test the reception was very passive aggressive and rude and had an attitude of "well i guess if you don't care about your dog I can cancel the test"

Last week we noticed that Bella's medication hadn't arrived in the mail like it typically does.  Summer Hills denied the prescription refill without notifying us it was time for our Bella to get her check up.  Mildly irritating but fine so far, we scheduled an appointment for a week later.

When I arrive a week later the reception told me that they have no appointment scheduled for Bella and we would have to bring her back another time.  I tried to talk to her, to see if we could somehow get her in today, that I would be willing to wait.  She was incredibly rude, passive aggressive, and belittling.  After being polite but assistant she checked with the vet if Bella could be seen today because we were nearly out of her medication and didn't want her going longer without it.  The vet sent her back to ask if we had collected Bella's urine sample.  When we first scheduled her appointment there was no mention of collecting a urine sample.

I told her I don't want to run any additional test, I just want her to get her medication so she can be taken care of.  She claimed it was the law that they give her a urinalysis, to which I replied "You guys consistently try to pressure me into additional test and preventative treatments, I just want my dog to get a check up so I can get her medication.  You renewed her prescription last time without urinalysis, and her previous vet renewed it for years without urinalysis.  Does a law really requires urinalysis for this?"  At this point she got angry and told me that the vet wouldn't be seeing Bella without a urine sample.

I said fine, how do I collect this sample.  At this point I just wanted to get my dog her medication.  She responded in voice like she was talking to a small child, "I'll be happy to tell you how to collect urine, as soon as you change your tone of voice".  I at no point yelled, raised my voice, or was anything but polite and courteous to this lady whom had been very rude to me.  I told her that this is a frustrating situation, my appointment got canceled somehow, and asked her if she could please just tell me how to collect my dogs urine so I can get her her medication ASAP.  She said "I'd be happy to as soon you're ready to let me do my job."  Again I didn't interrupt her, speak rudely to her, raise my voice, or do anything that could be construed as aggressive in any way.

At that point I told her no thank you, I'll be looking for another vet.  Honestly I'm still kind of blown away by this whole thing.  This is some of the worst customer service i've ever had.  And now I need to try and find another vet to get my dog her medication.<//review>

Each time we have used their services the pricing has changed and they pick and choose when you can do an 6 month, 12 month or 18 month plan with care credit... I work with care credit and know that you shouldn't pick and choose. Not only did we have a huge issue with financing with this office with no resolution from the office manager, but from start to finish we had a bad experience. First visit the front office gal walked out of the office and never returned. Weird right? guess she was having a bad day. Second bad experience was after our pup had services done she developed a huge knot on the side of belly. We took her back the next day (which we were charged for?) to see why this happened. They said it could be from the vet tech giving her to many shots in the same spot and it should go down. Nope never went down! Last straw was trying to get a hold of the office manager, she was always rude, never in the office and would take weeks to get back to us. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt but at this point I'm warning people. If you want someone to take advantage of your money and not help with any concerns, this is the place to come!< /review>

I called at 8am on a day the vet only did procedures and was able to get my cat in by 10.  He got a minor surgery as a new patient and was home happy and healing by 5.  The Doctor was straight forward and asked many questions before looking at my cat.  I am very happy and will keep my cat here.  My dog will be joining the summer hills family soon.<//review>

I went to San Juan veterinary hospital for many many years, slowly but surely the vets  we're not available or had moved on, didn't like the new one they had hired so I started going to this wonderful veterinarian David Davis DVM. He's a very compassionate and kind man, very knowledgeable and his staff treat you like family, can't say enough good about these folks, love them.</text>

Dr. Davis has been my Veterinarian for over 30 years. I recommend him to everyone and cannot imagine trusting anyone else with my kitties. He even takes the time to call me personally to explain what is going on with my kitty. When one of my kitties was near the end of her life, he gave me his personal cell phone number in case I needed him. If you want a DVM who can deal with and figure out complex issues or just an all around amazing Veternarian, Dr. Davis is you man. His reputation in the community is beyond reproach.<//Review>

<Review>When no one else could figure out what was wrong with my Maltese, Dr. Davis figured it out.  She is doing well now, but before, her skin was always breaking out.  I had even taken her to a specialist in dermatology and even that didn't help.

If you love your pet, take him/her to Dr. Davis!<//Review><time>1376063127882</time><username>Linda Baxter</username><gmap_id>0x809adf7c06e22b91:0xbb8f7c1c82861d7f< /gmap_id>< response>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>The lemon pepper wings were DELICIOUS... We showed up when they had just opened so had the advantage of no crowd... What I disliked was that their drink machine was completely out of anything that was NOT soda and I didn't want soda!! Everything this early in the day should be well stocked!! Also the music they had blaring was so NOT customer friendly...<//Review>< pictures>

I really don't know what all the hate is about. I just picked up my order that's ALREADY PAID for and everything checked out perfectly and food was warm after arriving maybe 15 to 20 minutes after placing my order. Idk maybe it just works for the locals? All im saying this place gets an A+ from me<//Review>

Had placed an order a for 30 boneless wings combo that came with fries. They gave me all bone in and even left out the fries. I called immediately and spoke with a manager named Patty. She told me she was able to give me a whole new order to make up for their mistake. I get there about a month later to redeem it only for Patty to tell me that she never spoke to me on the phone and didn’t write my name anywhere. I was very upset and she didn’t seem to care one bit for the customer. Wing Stop did a terrible job in assigning their management roles in the Compton location. I urge everyone not to visit this wing stop because any of you could easily be in my position with the way Patty is running the store. Truly disappointed.<//text>

Chicken is ok. Due to covid you cannot eat inside. Better to call in your order so you dont have to wait. Alittle expensive for a combo.<//Text>

The only reason I give it a 4 star is because it's kinda small on the inside. The service?? Great! The wait is about 15 minutes for every time I visited and the staff is friendly. Parking is plentiful. They tend to go light on the lemon and pepper,I don't know why. 3 times I ordered lemon pepper wings they're light. I don't know about you,but I like a strong lemon and plenty of pepper on mine.<//Text>

<review>This Wingstop is the only Wingstop that doesn't pour drinks. During covid-19 times, they're making everyone coming in touch the machine. Very unsanitary. And disappointed.< /review></record>

<Review>Usually we don't have any problems when eating at this Wingstop, but today, we got there and the only table available had a tray left behind by a previous customer. We had to walk the tray to the counter and clean off the table ourselves. The staff kept calling out orders for people who weren't even there yet. It took us 30 minutes to get our food, and even then, the staff took back our bag because we were dining in and it took her about another 10 minutes for her to bring back our food on a tray. The food was good, but I did notice our order of regular fries did have more fries than our order of voodoo fries. Also, my order of Spicy Korean Q wings hardly had any sauce on them. I did see it was a busy night, just hope we won't have to wait 40 minutes for our order the next time around.</Review>< username>

They are very slow. Even when you call ahead of time they are still slow. The first time I went I ordered online around 1pm I didn’t get my food until almost 230. They even had to issue refunds because people been there longer than an hour. But I decided to come back again because last time I gave them the benefit of the doubt because they were supposedly training someone. But anyway I go back again and I ordered my food online again at 2:57pm and it was suppose to be done by 315pm. I didn’t receive my food until 348pm. I knew it wasn’t ready because when I got there employees was playing and talking like they were on break or something. I would never go to that location again. Unless they hire more serious workers.</text>

Cashier would rather talk to a fellow employee than to take my order, when a big line started to form. I honestly felt bad for the one cashier actually doing his work. Being a restaurant for wing, the wings were really bad.  I asked for hot and mild, both came out very dry. They had little to no sauce, which gave the wing no taste. I had such a hard time eating the wings that couldn’t finish. Would not recommend.<//Review>

They asked for my id and then gave me a bag filled with sauce that broke in my car. The bag was literally filled with sauce and stained my car seat when i put it down. Disrespectful workers. Horrible cashier and horribles service. Highly not recommended. The cashier that carded me was briana. The chicken they game me was old. If i could give them negative stars were only possible.</Review>

<review>Went it and 10 50pm their chairs were already up. I placed my order they had me wait over 20 minutes and I thought it would be ok since I would think the wings would be good. They told me my order and I left thinking it was as the employee recited to me. I get home my wings were under cooked, and they gave me one original hot and 5 lemon pepper when I specifically asked for half and half. They also over cooked the fries and didn't add lemon pepper like I asked. I was so overwhelmed I would have rather have them tell me they didn't want to take my order and save me time and money.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
Second time here in a long time ..Last night 12/17/17 I purchased the 30 wing deal with fries to go for the fam... while i was eating I tasted some was off and Man ooh man!.20-30 minutes later every single person in the house got sick...my kids started vomiting I rushed into nearest pharmacy with a stomachache asked what's good for like a bad meal..
A curious person asked me "what happened"
I told him I had some "Wingstop"..never knew what this person told me ...THAT PLACE WAS SHUT DOWN AMONG 3 OTHER RESTAURANTS FOR A MONTH! DUE TO SOME DRAIN PROBLEMS...i got Sicker after that .so I'm thinking did they used old food that was stored for that long or reuse the same old oils..i say this because my 2 year old boy got sick and he only eat the fries...whatever it was not cool they should double check inventory Very very disappointing...negative star's if possible< /Review>

I’m actually here still waiting for my food . Host Maria was extremely rude . I was standing in line with no one behind me , when she decided to answer a phone call after I’ve been standing there infront of her for 2 minutes & she decides to , take their order . Then she takes mine . I mean she could of put the phone call on hold or ask me to bear with her . Then she’s very quick to talk and hard to understand . I hope my wings aren’t dry . Let me see what’s up with my order .< /Text>

<Text>This was an incredibly enjoyable place to get a great meal. Everything we had was excellent! Certainly a fantastic steak, the sides and sauce were delicious as well. Service was attentive while not intrusive. Highly recommended 👌< /Text>< Pictures>

Took our older parents out for Mothers Day.  They wanted your typical chain restaurant; but  we wanted to elevate their meal! The waitress was fun and made our parents feel like celebrities!   Food portions were huge,  amazing and so very tasty! Black bean soup is a meal in itself and our dad loved his Kobe steak~ cleaned the plate!   Everyone enjoyed our Moms Day meal! Thank you!!</Text>

<review>Absolutely amazing. Food was perfect. Hot when it came out and so good. The waiter was very knowledgeable and very on top of everything. The atmosphere was a little on the warm side. Not sure if the air conditioner was broken but overall a great experience. We will be back!</review><user>107432787580548698407<//user><username>Jessica A<//username>< Rate>

<Gmap_id>0x809ada561433f66d:0xdd4b7deee2bc684e< /Gmap_id><Review>Our waitress Erin rocked!!!

Everyone was happy with their food. My lamb was not medium rare; but, it was more medium to medium well. However, I am not a sender backer or one to request a new dish. To my surprise it was still delish! I'd still personally prefer a more evenly cooked med rare lamb chop; but, it was still good. We had 2 oven baked pizza orders which both guests were estatic about. The main man ordered the  ravioli. There was not a drop of sauce left as he mopped it up with bread and pizza crust his wife shared.

The crowd was definitely older. We are more middle aged. I would definitely go back again because Erin was amazing!!!

I would not recommend it for my 22 year old who finds chicks on tinder.  The vibe was more mature.

Sorry I have no pics. My plate looked great though!!!</Review><user_name>Karen Russell</user_name><userid>104725608976902837824<//userid>< time>

Then to top it off, the food is equally 5 star worthy!  I recently took my mom out for lunch (the first time in over a year, due to Covid) and unfortunately our lunch plans didn't go the way we hoped at all.  As we were walking into the restaurant, my father collapsed (medical circumstances) and before I even had a chance to turn my head to ask for help, 2 servers and the banquet manager rushed out of the restaurant and helped my father back up.  They quickly helped him and my mother into the restaurant, sat them down, and got them some water.  They were so busy in the restaurant, but they dropped everything they were doing and immediately came to help.  My father and mother wanted to stay and try to order something, but given the circumstances we thought it would be better to go home.  The incredible staff quickly prepared our order and bagged everything securely so we could get back on the road and get my parents home.

Their kindness and service are truly things to be praised.  Thank you for going above and beyond to help my family during a crazy time in our lives.  We appreciate you so much!!</review>< Pics>

For her  93rd birthday we made the decision to eat outside on the patio. We so enjoyed it! Superb meals, great service and many wonderful memories of meals at this restaurant with more to come.

DO NOT HESITATE to eat here. Cleanliness and social distancing is in full force!

We've also ordered take out (FROM THEM DIRECTLY!) and will continue to do so. Eating meals from Zinfandel Grille is a big highlight for us this year! PLEASE SUPPORT THEM!!!</review>< UserId.>

We had a delightful dinner on the spacious outdoor patio at Zinfandel Grille. Our server went out of his way to make sure that we had an enjoyable experience.  From the cocktails to our main courses—we had rack of lamb and grilled salmon—everything was perfect. We look forward to returning soon.</text>

We are fans of Zinfandel Grille. The food and service are great. We continue to support one of our favorite Sacramento restaurants during these challenging times by taking advantage of take out via curbside service. The menu is extensive.  Looking forward to the good old days when we can regularly dine inside again. Support Zinfandel Grille and enjoy take out.<//text>

It was my first visit. Everything was better than expected. The crab cakes with slaw was a meal in itself. The grilled salmon with vegetables was a perfect balance. The nicoise salad was enough for two. I highly recommend this restaurant.</text>

This is one of the best restaurants in Sacramento. Been here several times but finally decided to leave a review. Excellent staff that's courteous and very professional. Delicious food!! Recently took their offer of dining outdoors under a tent that's located behind their restaurant in the parking lot...They did not skip a beat. Just as great as they were indoors.< /review>

We went here for the first time. What an outstanding food experience we had! I ordered the seafood angel hair pasta and it was delicious. There were large gulf shrimp, lobster, and other seafood that were not overcooked and it had just the right amount of seasoning. My boyfriend had the pappardelle Bolognese noodles that had ground filet mignon, and pork which was amazing. The service was on the outdoor  patio with a heater next to us which made it a cozy experience. The waiter gave out outstanding service. We had a wonderful cozy experience with excellent food, good service in a cozy setting. Happy to go back</Review>

We celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary last night at Zinfandel Grille and had a great experience. My husband has not been out to a restaurant since Covid started and is very anxious about being in public and we felt very safe.
Our food was delicious, the patio was beautiful and our server was wonderful and more than accommodating. We made a bad choice with our wine selection and she was very kind when we decided to exchange the bottle for a different one.
Thank you for a lovely meal and night out!< /Review>

Funny story, my boyfriendand I were looking for a place that was open for dine in so that we could have a good dinner date, and this place popped up in the search bar, so I was like "why not lol". Neither of us have been here before and we wanted to try something new so be both decided to come! No regrets whatsoever!

This is an absolutely fantastic restaurant! The atmosphere was gorgeous and welcoming, customer service was top notch, friendly, and inviting, and the food was phenomenal! Sure, it's a little pricey, but it was absolutely worth it! Definitely coming back here again sometime :)< /review>

<text>We had our company holiday luncheon here. They have valet parking as it is difficult to find a place to park due to the close proximity to other businesses nearby.  Plan accordingly so you can find a parking spot.
We had an 11:45 a.m. reservation and the restaurant was already packed and hopping with other couples and small groups having lunch.  There is not much room inside for a large party (we had nine in our party) to wait to be seated.
It appeared chaotic with wait staff walking back and forth along with the busboys bring bread and water to the tables. It was quite noisy, and cramped (tables close together) that we had a hard time hearing each other talk.
We were seated and given menus, water was poured and bread delivered. No one told us the daily specials or what the soup of the day was. Our waiter never told us his name.
We started off with two orders of friend calamari. Cooked to perfection. Tender morsels of goodness.  Served with aioli sauce and what appeared to be sweetened ketchup. It would have been better had there been horseradish in it to give it zip.
We ordered the Kobe Steak. Who serves Kobe steak with sauce poured over it? It came with a handful of raw baby spinach and mashed potatoes.
The Cannelloni was just that. Two freshly made crepe-like pastas and sauce. No side salad, no vegetable saute. Just the pasta. Very unfinished. It would have benefited from some freshly grated parmesan.
The French Dip was okay. Sparse on the meat. Served with French fries and au jus.
The Grilled Prawn Salad would have been great had the prawns been freshly grilled. Everything on the salad was delicious. We think that the prawns were what gave us issues later that afternoon.
We had the Pasta special which had one asparagus spear sliced in a delicious tomato sauce and freshly cooked prawns.
We ordered some desserts and had a rude woman, not our waiter, serve them to us. She was like a slap-in-the-face when she spoke to our group. To top it off she also delivered dirty spoons to us.
Banana Fosters Bread Pudding. It was popping hot served with a melting scoop of vanilla ice cream. Definitely enough for two to share.
The Chocolate Lava Cake was dry and the ice cream had slipped off and was melting on the plate. Not a favorite.
It's the holiday season and we will not be returning to Zinfandel Grille for future company gatherings. They will not miss our business as the restaurant was packed on a Tuesday for lunch.< /text><UserId.>101761588418388535261< /UserId.>< gmapID>

Another GREAT lunch at Zinfandel Grille.  The fresh pasta special was fabulous.  This being Friday, the clam chowder is a must as well.</Text>

<Review>My wife and I had forgotten that our 13th anniversary was that day--until around 3pm. What to do to celebrate? We usually make reservations at Zinfandel Grille for special occasions. But with COVID-19, restaurants are not offering dine-in service. The solution? Order our dinner online and have it delivered. Two hours later, our dinner arrived at the front door. We set the table, transferred our dinner from the boxes to our plates, and had a lovely time.< /Review>< Rating>

First time eating at Zinfandel Grille and it was absolutely delicious! The cocktails were on point, service was great, and the food?! Get the short ribs and filet (with gorgonzola...). Divine. We'll be back soon...probably every Saturday night. :)</review>

One of Sacramento's top restaurants for many reasons! The Zinfandel Grille is perfect for business or pleasure. Picked the most flavorful entree: Perfectly cooked Kobe steak atop a bed of mashed potatoes and spinach, and overflowing with porcini mushroom sauce. In addition to the vast wine selection and excellent service, the tomato bisque soup is a notable and perfect starter. Wine, unwind, and fine dine at Zinfandel Grille.</review>

First time in there, everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. But I was there to try the food and I forgot the name of the dish I ate Cannelloni maybe(thanks spelling helper), it was so good! I wish I took a picture of it. Texture and taste were all there. This place was really pack during lunch, so I'd advise to get there ASAP.</text>

Very upset with our experience here. We made reservations for the patio over the phone and when we came in to eat they said that they put it in wrong and had us on the curbside. I couldn’t bring myself to eat filet mignon 6 inches from a road on the sidewalk.
Hoping I get an opportunity to eat here eventually, and next time they put in our reservation correctly.<//Review>

My husband, bff and I came here after my wedding on Friday. My bff called ahead (but we had no idea). When we arrived, we were greeted by the catering manager- I really wish I could remember her name. She was amazing! The food was absolutely delicious. Then they brought us a bread pudding, with a special congrats for us, on a white chocolate bar. It was such a special surprise! I loved the food, the atmosphere and the employees. We’ll definitely be back.

Thanks again for making our wedding lunch so special!<//Text>

<Review>Quick seating without reservation at 6pm was appreciated.  The dinner was tasty, fresh, in just the right portions. Wine recommendation was good after we ruled out our preferred choice based on the cost of the bottle. Parking in the rear was easy. Have also sat at bar previously and received prompt friendly service from the bartender. Worth returning.<//Review><gmapID>0x809ada561433f66d:0xdd4b7deee2bc684e</gmapID>< Name>

Why we have never been to this fine establishment before - dont ask me why because i dont know! We had a celebratory dinner planned with another couple and they suggested it as they had heard it was top notch. First of all the service was as good as it gets. We were a little early so we had a glass of wine, bread on the table with oil, and water before the other couple even arrived maybe five minutes later. The wine selection was good and we drank a nice Pinot throughout the dinner.<//review>

I bought the meals as a gift to my family, who live in another home.  I sent the receipt to the family, though that is not what I usually do when it’s a surprise.  I just found out the salmon dinner was not included.  I was charged $30 and the tip was based upon the total price.</review>

<Date>1569298249503</Date><Text>Server provided poor service unless unfriendly is the desired atmosphere. Admittedly, we were there unexpectedly after the gym and were in less than optimal attire, but service definitely appeared to be adjusted well downward. Wife's burger was ordered medium well but came out medium rare. My gumbo was not brought out, I did not mention it until the end when I was no longer hungry and simply wanted it removed from the bill, but the waiter just stood around for a minute silently judging before acknowledging it. We may give it a second chance in the future but it certainly won't be a first choice.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Excellent, both food and service. We were a group of 8. I ordered a prime rib french dip to take home. Lunch was carnitas tacos with a mushroom salad. The tacos were outstanding. Nice menu so you can try different items each visit. Prices seem reasonable and they are having a promotion  offering free corkage on Mondays and Wednesdays. Corkage is usually$15, so this was a nice bonus. Not sure how long this runs. Check when you make reservations.</text></record>

Very standard American / Italian food. Pizza, pasta, salad, and some hot protein mains. Customers are mostly the elderly, and that is who they cater to. Older menu, lots of Sun-dried tomatoes in their dishes. It's a totally ok restaurant, but for the price and quality there are many better options.<//review>

Jammed on a Wednesday night! The service was good, but the kitchen was backed up. Our server did a fine job, and the Mustard Chicken was tasty. My Lamb was okay, I was served one double chop and one single chop. 3 chops - $30 bucks a tad over priced and the double chop was blue! The single was perfect.<//text>

My close friend got the Shelf of Lamb and also she was really happy with her dish. I on the other hand bought the Kobe Beef, I have actually consumed Kobe beef before and enjoyed it, primarily because it is regularly tender and also a pleasing cut of meat. I was really disappointed!I really did not make a fuss or send it back since it was my pals birthday celebration, but needless to say I did not appreciate my dish.</text>

The food here is excellent, and the ambience is nice. The only drawback we experienced was the service was a bit slow. Hubby had leg of lamb, our son had the grilled pork chop and I had a Cobb salad. We started with calamari, which was very nicely done. Lightly crisp. Our meals were all very good, with interesting sides. This is not an inexpensive place to eat, but a nice place for a celebratory meal or special occasion.</Text>

The Zinfandel Grille has always been on the family restaurants list. The pizzas are delicious with the finest ingredients for the break. The pizzas are scrumptious and they are a very good dish. The crust is not too thin and not to thick. It is a perfect place for a date. The staff is the most attentive staff I have ever seen and ordered from. This is the finest American Fusion Restaurant and I recommend this highly. The decor is up-to-date, and the colors are the most soothing and refreshing. The desserts are delicious, and I recommend the lava cake or the creme-brulet. The meat is fully cooked, and I love the polenta. The restaurant is also good for rootbeer, and the wines are a wide selection. Bar or table is very comfortable.</Review>

The New England style clam chowder is always delicious.  The fresh bread with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil (with herbs and fresh garlic is also always delicious. My wife had the pork chop(wonderfully tender)with polenta cake and green beans. She was duly pleased.  I ordered the filet and substituted mashed potatoes and spinach for the offered fingerling potatoes and asparagus. Sadly my steak was very fatty and overcooked.  I sent it back.  It took the entire meal to get the replacement which I had boxed to go at that point.  This is not the first time they have served an overcooked steak.  The GM brought the box to our table and said "sorry you didn't like the first one" I let him know the chef agreed that it was not cooked properly and was inordinately fatty.  He did not offer to take anything off the bill or even offer a dessert on the house for the error.  The food is generally very good and the service good, although the entrees frequently are slow to arrive. Really not impressed with the customer service after they screwed up our meal however and they did the same thing last time I had to send my food back.  Not my idea of the way a patron should be treated in this situation.</Review>

Your Filet absolutely should have been prepared correctly the first time, but unfortunately, cooking a new Filet takes almost 15 minutes on the grill from start to finish.  When this happens we get a new Filet on the grill immediately and offer a soup or salad on us so one person isn't sitting without food at the table.  We will bring up your feedback at our weekly management meeting as we are always trying to improve our customer experience.\n\nAllen"}< /Response><UserId.>106587144377496555299< /UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

we loved this place and plan to go back. the food was outrageously delicious--yes, i just used those words. service was great. the parking is free if you can find it. they have 2 handicap parking spaces in the back but the place was packed. hubby dropped me at the door to park the car. accessible entrance. good seating too, although somewhat tight for a walker/wheelchair, I wouldn't want to try a scooter in this place. did i mention delicious? wish i could get a jar of that mushroom sauce that was on hubby's stake!<//review>

<review>The salmon with the teriyaki glaze was fantastic. I'm not usually much of a teriyaki fan, but it was just the right amount of flavor, and seared so it had a crispy crust. So flavorful!! Cooked perfectly and very tender on the inside. Paired with parmesan mashed potatoes and fresh squash and zucchini. Delicious! Highly recommend this dish. It's pricey, but definitely an excellent meal!<//review>< rate>

I was there for a work function. The staff was attentive and friendly. Never was I without a drink. The appetizers were amazingly good. The salmon pizza, or bruchetta, I'm not sure which, was incredible. The only detraction is that when I first walked in I was hit with the smell of fish and dishwater.</review>

I had the salmon and risotto (not on the everyday menu) and it was cooked to perfection! The chef was a bit heavy-handed with the finishing salt (I love sodium, so for me to say it was salty; means it was pretty salty), but my dates plate wasn't salty; so my guess is that it was a one-off mistake. But even with the extra salt; my plate was SO good. Their tea was a bit disappointing, but the service was excellent!

Always a good experience. Had swordfish with papaya and fried risotto cake. Came out moist and  delicious.
Service is spot on with a decent selection of wine.
Tonight was a live "jazz" type band which added a nice touch to the ambience. The crowd is for the most part well retired people in 65+ with a sprinkle of mid 40's. A treat for my wife and I.

The food was excellent!  I had the shrimp salad. Shrimp grilled to perfection!  Kinda pricey but worth it.   Ambience was great!<//review>

< Review>
The Zinfandel Grille has excellent variety (new specials every day), impeccable wood-fired pizzas, delicious entrees and deserts, an endless beverage list, and excellent, attentive service. All served in a beautifully-designed interior with live music on certain evenings. What more can one ask for?

Edit: Unfortunately, the Early Bird discount is no more, so I cannot come as often, but the new ownership has keep the experience just as great as always.< /Review>

<text>The Zinfandel Grille is a classic in Sacramento. They live their mission -- Grape Vines grow out front, and people openly sneak a nibble of the ripening fruit. Handsome, traditional, decor  and consistently excellent food. They do an especially good job with lamb and beef dishes. The wood burning oven, visible from the dining area, adds a cozy ambience and mouth-watering fragrance that draws diners in of the street. Get on their mailing list and get their monthly discount coupons. It's made me a regular!<//text>< userid>

<review>It was my very first time right here with my entire workplace. We were below commemorating our hygienists birthday. Such a beautiful, tidy, as well as welcoming environment. I'm offering this location 3 stars due to the fact that the solution we obtained was doing not have in listening. At the time we came in for a party of 7 the dining establishment was not busy. Our server was extremely absent-minded, and also throughout our dish he determined to start windexing the door and also while splashing I could see the bits simply wandering our method ... Anyways, the food tasted terrific! My mustard chicken was a little on the charred side in some areas. The spinach salad was delicious.My doctor calzone was cold in the center.All in all, would certainly attempt this place once more. Hopefully next time there will certainly be far better service.</review>< Pictures>

I did not get the requested table in front room.

We were located in  rear of the back room.

Service was slow because we were so far away.

PS: And no mushroom salad :(<//Text>

I apologize that we weren't able to get you the requested table in the front room on your visit and the slower than normal service.  We do our best to accomodate all seating requests; however, due to limited capacity and social distancing restrictions there are times when we unfortunately cannot accomodate specific seating requests.\n\nSince the COVID19 situation began we have not been able to reliably source fresh, high quality mushrooms from our local purveyors.  Therefore, our chef decided to temporarily remove the mushroom salad from the menu.  It is a delicious salad and a customer favorite so we will bring it back as soon as possible!\n\nI will pass on your feedback to our management team as we are always striving to improve our restaurant.

<UserId.>100652832779409916567<//UserId.><text>Went for a lunch get together, the service was really good, the drinks were strong, but the food was okay. I had the mustard chicken. It was a little on the greasy side, was fried for just a little too long, and was kind of heavy. The bacon in the spinach and carrots was a little too much for me since it was also cooked in sherry vinaigrette. I would recommend the restaurant, but maybe a different dish would be better.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Perfect Mother’s Day dinner.  Attentive and well spoken server, food came appropriately timed, and nice coffee.  Steaks were cooked perfectly rare and my pork chop was satisfying and delicious.  The restaurant was full and bustling  but we never felt rushed and our server wished the mother of the table a very sweet happy mother’s day On the way out.< /Review><GmapID>0x809ada561433f66d:0xdd4b7deee2bc684e<//GmapID><username>Everett wong<//username>< Pics>

We have come here many times. It's one of my mother-in-law's favorite restaurants. The service and food is usually excellent. It loses a star for their portion size/price. I always feel underwhelmed when the $20 dish comes and I can tell it won't even fill me up. If you want something that will fill you up for the most bang for your buck, get the burger. But clearly their target market is not those concerned about price.<//Text>

< Review>
My family and I had an absolutely warm and enjoyable pre-Christmas dinner at Zinfandel Grille.  The meal included two steak and two salmon dinners, each of which were prepared exactly as ordered.  We felt cared for by the wait staff and we never had to ask for anything as our server anticipated all of our needs.  We have visited many times and Zinfandel is our "go to" restaurant for good food, good service and good times.   Mercedes Gay.</Review>

Z Grill has been our go-to spot for years for special events and/or date night time. Great wine list, mushroom salad, calzone, salmon and on and on make for a great meal. Service is always excellent.</text>

My gal pal and I went here tonight.  She treated me for my birthday.  We were greeted by a wonderful maitre d, were seated at a nice table, and had a great waitress, Amy.  We had a great glass of wine and were allowed to relax and chat until we were ready to order.  We ordered the special, which was Swordfish.  Everything was perfect, as always.< /Text>

I hadn't been here for awhile and found out they stopped serving their yummy meat loaf - how disappointing!  I opted for one of their pizzas instead which was very good, but I sure missed the meat loaf!  Our server was outstanding and made sure everything was to our satisfaction.<//Text>

The crew over here know how to get it done! Hands down the best pork chop I've ever had and awesome service. Any of their dishes are great and I would suggest them to anyone!

The  Mustard chicken was the boom.
The  Kobe steak with average at best
I would have gave 4 stars if the  Service was just a little bit better.

<Text>Had Thanksgiving here. Unfortunately, it was quite disappointing. Salmon was undercooked, other food too salty. Felt like we were eating at a cheap cafe with no choices. I understand the limited menu but not having a way to cook fish more was crazy. Felt rushed and we were there less than an hour.< /Text>< Pictures>

I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with the Thanksgiving dinner.  Our reservation was for 6:30 and we were seated(at the last table by the back door and next to the kitchen!) right after we got there.  We then waited at least 15 minutes for anyone to notice we were there.  After we finally ordered, the salads took forever to be served.By the time we were served our dinner, my iced tea glass was empty.  Well, guess what, it was still empty when we left.  No one had bothered to ask if I wanted more. When we finally got our dinner, mine turkey, my husbands prime rib, my potatoes, sweet potatoes and gravy were all cold.  I asked for some hot gravy and the waiter was happy to serve it.  While my husband worked on a prime rib that had grizzle throughout, I asked the waiter to please bring me a cup of coffee and my dessert.  "you don't want to wait until he is done?" the waiter asked, I said "no, I'd like it now."  He said "oh, if that's the way you guys want to do it."  About halfway through my coffee I asked the waiter if I might have my dessert "oh" he exclaimed, "I thought  you already had it".  By this time my husband had finished fighting with his prime rib and I asked the waiter to box my remaining turkey and bring my husbands dessert.  He left and when he returned he had boxed my turkey and all the way around it he had put the portion of the prime rib that my husband tried to chew but could not.  He also informed my husband that they were out of tiramisu which was what my husband had ordered. All in all a horrible Thanksgiving experience.</Text>

< Review>
Took my brother for a birthday dinner.  Ordered the spinach "pasta special" .  My wife and I agreed, it tasted like they made it with Elmer's glue.  The spinach pasta stuck together in one blob, the prawns were sticky with what seemed like a flour paste. The 4 or 5 squares of chicken and the three prawns was all we could salvage from the dish.  Left hungry and the 2 star rating is for the service.</Review>

<Text>Was really excited to go here because it's supposed to be an upscale kind of restaurant but as soon as we were seated it was apparently clear this was NOT going to be the nice lunch I had imagined. There was only a few groups in the entire place yet the waiter still placed us next to 2 loudly chatting groups of elderly people(horrible). Then when I ordered a grapefruit paloma and had a taste, it was more like a tequila and ice sort of deal, our waiter who was also the stand in bartender had to remake it 3 times before it was drinkable, and it still wasnt that great! The food was also very lame, my boyfriend ordered the caesar salad which is one of his favorite dishes, and he couldn't even finish it because it was so underwhelming! I ordered the ham calzone which was worth the price because it was big, but still I've had better calzones from winco's deli section. Will not be returning and definitely will not recommend EVER.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Went for mothers day brunch.  On the recommendation of a friend. Was not impressed.  They did not make mothers feel special.
Adequate food. Nothing special, salmon, ham and desserts dry.< /review>

<review>The wait is very long if you do not have a reservation. And people will grab your seats if you are not in attack mode. What they will make you do for food.
The food is good but the hype is too much. Its expensive too. With tip we paid hundred dollars.<//review><user>101224050540643973897<//user>< Resp>

<review>Came for Happy Hour. Enjoyed the food and drinks. A bit pricey for happy hour. I have to do eat gluten-free (GF) and dairy free (DF), but they dont have alternate options for GF except to just take it away.  I was hoping for a GF hamburger bun but their GF solution was abstinence rather than making their own buns.  Zinfandel grill has the kind of kitchen I"d expect to have caught up with the GF reality by now.</review>< Gmap_id>

The wait is very long if you do not have a reservation. And people will grab your seats if you are not in attack mode. What they will make you do for food.
The food is good but the hype is too much. Its expensive too. With tip we paid hundred dollars.< /review>

Great local place to eat for a treat!

Popular so make a reservation or prepare to either eat outside or wait. For the same reason be patient when parking. There are many tasty selections and specials, live music, and newcomer discounts (hint: email list) so it's a low-risk venture to try.

The Friday night we dined we were spared a 20 minute wait and seated immediately outside since we had no reservations, passing by fresh food preparation on the way. Staff was friendly, attentive without being overbearing, and quite accommodating. Lots of good teamwork noted with service.

The atmosphere is fresh and light despite activity, unpretentious but stylish, and in true California mode is appropriate for the casual dresser to the gussied up romantic date. Not really a kid place, unless you're with a big party but they also do banquets.

The manager let us know there are 22 different kinds of (mostly non-vocalist) musical groups there on Friday and Saturdays. The volume was just right as backdrop music. On Wednesdays they have a myriad of specials and shenanigans offered.

Our dishes were superbly done, with clear but subtle flavors and gently sauced. They make nearly everything from scratch and are more than happy to customize your meal. I had Salmon with Polenta cake and mixed squash. It was delicious! (And I don't usually like squash) My friend had beautifully done Pork Chops served with a creamy butternut squash. Kinda made me wish we could trade. Or eat both :] Plus they made me a killer Old Fashioned with my favorite Woodford Bourbon, thanks to our fabulous server, Amy!!

If the prices were a little lower here it'd become dangerous for me! LOL
Even after just one visit, I declare this one a total win!< /review>

Attended a birthday celebration at this site. This is a very popular and a very busy place thereby having to endure much noise despite the area of the celebration was separate. The service was excellent. It would have been great if the party's noise was the only noise.</text>

<Text>Decent food but overpriced for what you get, I spent $100 for dinner on two people. The staff is friendly and attentive, very upscale dining and they have live music on Friday and Saturday night. Be aware that it can be loud when they are busy and have live music. I highly recommend making reservations on the weekend, otherwise you will be waiting a while for a table.</Text><date>1494261395090< /date><Name>Jeff Lebowski</Name><response>None< /response>< user>

<Review>Went for Easter brunch, they stuck us in the back room which we had to pass thru the restroom hallway to access. When we went to get our food (passing by the restrooms again) the line was out the door. By the time we got to the bar (too high up for us short people and kids) the food was just ok, nothing special. The bacon was under cooked, the prime rib was so under cooked even the die hard sushi lovers in our group would not even try. They had french toast but nothing to put your syrup in so if you wanted any you had to have it run into your eggs. No omnlet bar and the desserts were just ok, not even an Easter egg in sight. Called the manager afterwards to complain and he said that's just the way is was. Needless to say our family will never go back for any breakfast , lunch or dinner again and I would suggest you don't either.<//Review>< username>
