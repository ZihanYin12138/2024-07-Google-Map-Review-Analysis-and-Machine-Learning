<Response>None</Response><Text>A terrific pleasure having dinner here with my wife and son last week. The meal was perfect and the owner of the restaurant was a congenial host. Our food was freshly prepared and very, very, very good.

The owner treated us to a free serving of rice pudding that was absolutely terrific. Wow.

Prices were very fare and the entire experience was perfect.

Well done.<//Text><pics>None<//pics></record>

<review>I was a little disappointed this visit. The food was not up to their usual standard.

Lukewarm Mary's Lemon Chicken Soup. Failed to get our order correct. They did make up for it and not charge for the forgotten item when they brought it. The turkish coffee was not hot and not as strong as normal.

My 10 year old grandson always gets the grilled salmon platter. He even commented that the fish was not very warm and the veggies were soggy.

We drove up from San Jose to go to Coyote Point and to especially have lunch at the Mediterranean.  We will more than likely not be returning. It is difficult finding places my grandsons, who travel extensively,  they find to their liking. I was hoping, after our first visit a month ago, this would be that 'go to' place. Unfortunately,  second time around was a miserable experience.</review>< pictures>

Delicious food that leaves you feeling full yet light at the end of the meal. And I could (and have) eat their hummus by the spoonful! Definitely priced appropriately for the quality ingredients and meals they offer.</review>

<Review>There has been several restaurants at this location recently.  As I drove by, noticed that there was a new restaurant so we gave it a shot.  Food was tasty, service was very good, promises were clean, prices were very reasonable given the large portions.  Definitely will come back because meal portions and ambiance makes the experience worth it.  I cant say that for many other restaurants in downtown Burlingame. Hope others feel the same.  Give them a shot!<//Review><rating>5</rating>< pictures>

Excellent customer service.  Portions were decent.  I'd suggest a little bit more of the lamb/beef in the gyro plate. Hummus was delicious.  Hubby had salmon- good portion, at least 6 oz.
Covid precautions were right on, compared to other restaurants on Burlingame Ave which were sketchy (other restaurants the patrons were all too close together). Great experience.  They were even very kind to our two dogs who were with us on their patio.<//text>

They're open for indoor and outdoor dining! The portions are a bit small, but the staff are super friendly so it makes up for it. I loved sitting in their semi outdoor section where you can people watch as well as enjoy the weather without being in the sun! I got the mixed grill combo which was quite flavorful<//review>

<Review>Newly opened Mediterranean cuisine place surprised me with their delicious meat kebabs, gyros and tons of salad! Fattoush salad was amazing and portion was so big that you can, definitely, share. I tried their chicken lemon soup and loved it. Chicken gyro plate is yummy and you can ask them to substitute with other stuff jow you like. Well done chef!<//Review>< Time>

Great find here in Burlingame! The appetizer plate is excellent as is the Greek salad. Portion size is big and filling. The hosts are very welcoming!
Perfect spot if you have kids, are on a date or looking for a quick bite. The heated patio area is a bonus.
Highly recommend.< /Text>

New restaurant took over this location. Nice mediterranean-like menu plus a ton of options for salads. I’ve had chicken souvlaki plate, my bf had kofta plate, both were good. I really liked the chicken — grilled and moist cubes of grilled chicken plus grilled bell peppers. yum!
their hummus tastes and looks a little unusual but my bf liked it. Will be back to try their salads.</text>

Erkan was very polite and helpful. He made the whole experience lovely! All the staff was very helpful and kind. The greek salad was large and even shareable, but delicious so you may want your own. The falafels were great as well. If ever in the area again, I'd definitely visit. Thanks Erkan!</Text>

Have never been to the actual restaurant but love ordering from here on Uber Eats. Lamb & beef gyro is delicious and it comes with the best spicy sauce<//text>

The Greek salad with gyro is huge, easily a meal for two people. It's really reasonably priced given the size, I just wish it had been more flavorful.</Text>

Great place.  Kevin and Bobby always busy, but treat everyone like your the only person tbere.  Been doing business with Kevin, I think for twenty plus years.  When I was down, he got me good used tires.  Now that things are better, I'm buying 3 or more sets of new a year< /Text>

I went there looking for tires, i asked the man what kind of brands they got? He immediately told me in rude tone "go get it yourself and look for yourself.." I can't believe anyone would treat a customer this way. Never going there ever again.</Text>

<Review>They provided wonderful service experience. I have initially failed the test, so i had to go back after fixing the issue. I went back and there was a mysterious code stuck in the computer. They checked the code every weekend for free until I figured out what it was for over a month. They never gave me a hard time for keep on checking and it was pleasant experience the whole time.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I was able to speak with the manager over the phone and make an appointment that same day. I got in, was immediately greeted by the technician, and the whole smog test took less than 20 minutes. The service was courteous and very quick!<//Review>< Pictures>

With the coupon that I got in a mailer, they were one of the best deals in the county. They got me in without an appointment the same day. Took care of me quickly. And I'd be happy to recommend them. They even had great tunes in the bay while I was there.<//review>

I have been going to 101 Express smog for 5 years. They've always treated me very well. The best thing to do is always make an appointment you won't have to wait so long.< /Review>

Friendly and super fast, effective service. My friend recommended 101 Express Smog, and I'm glad she did. I was pleasantly surprised to find the experience quite painless. I've had my cars smogged a few times before, at places in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, and the experience has always been a hassle. 101 Express Smog made it easy - clear pricing and super fast service. I definitely will recommend 101 Express Smog to others!<//Review>

I'm not usually one to write a review but every once in a while I feel compelled to share my good experience. I walked in the other day to 101 Smog rushed, frantic, and generally irritated that I needed to take time out of my day to get a smog check. Let's be honest - who actually enjoys getting this done!

From the moment I got there, the technician was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient as he walked me through the necessary steps. Once he got to work, it took only about 15 minutes for the whole thing to be completed!. What's even better - now I know where I'm going the next time I need a smog. Thanks 101 Express!< /Text>

Decided to stop in and take care of my smog check last time I was in town. Heard about 101 Express Smog from a friend, and I had a great experience. Service was fast, effective and very reasonably priced! I usually dread taking my car in for a smog check every few years since it can be such a hassle, but I can't say enough good things about 101 Express Smog. Will definitely recommend to all my friends in the Bay Area.<//Text>

I had an appointment at noon I called a half hour early because I was having my smog check done on my lunch time to make sure that they were not busy. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. The technician was friendly and efficient. I would recommend this station to friends.< /Text>

Very good experience overall. Fairly easy to get to off the 101, and especially convenient if you are traveling from Cotati or Santa Rosa. Service was pretty fast from check-in to getting all of the documents back.< /Text>

<Text>Brought my car in for a smog test on Saturday morning, no appointment. After filling out appropriate paperwork, I was told the car would be ready in about 30 minutes. I took a walk over to Starbucks and returned to the shop about 20 minutes later, just as they were finishing up. Was told that my car passed and the certificate was sent to DMV, paid my $58.20 (with a coupon) and was on my way. My whole family has been bringing their cars here for smog tests for several years and we've always had positive experiences.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>I disagree with many of the reviews I've read about this SMOG station. I have an automotive background and I'm particular about my cars. That being said, I have taken all three of my cars to this location. They get the job done without any unnecessary discomfort and the employees are personable. They are not the cheapest ($75ish for a pre 1996 vehicle) but not the most expensive.</review>< gmap_id>

<review>Terrible. Don’t go here. $30 off coupon brought the price down to $65. Either they charge $95 for a smog or they lied to me. Either way it is ridiculous. Retest was almost the same price which is more expensive than a new test from a great shop down the street.

Had a car smogged here, didnt pass, scheduled a retest, then they told they couldnt do it because the same mechanic wasnt in that day and it wouldve taken longer for a different mechanic to do it all but 15 minutes before my appointment. Im sorry but thats laziness right there.</Text>

Performed a smog on a vehicle we subsequently sold. Turns out they incorrectly entered the VIN number into the DMV system with only 11 digits, not the full 13, so the new owner was not able to register the vehicle. Apparently the only way to fix the error was to perform another smog test at the same location, which required the new owner to drive 50 miles out of his way to correct. Manager was generally unhelpful and unsympathetic.< /text>

I had my smog test here two years ago and the price was around $40. I went in the other day and I had a $20 coupon. They charged me $71 dollars and took off the coupon so the bill was $60. That's $20 more than anyone else. I called around. You are getting the worst deal if you go here.<//Review>

This place is a complete rip off. Told me my care didn’t pass and charged me anyway. In addition to all the up selling, the technician and manager were very inexperienced and unprofessional. Horrible place, so definitely avoid.</review>

<Name>Kim Kemp</Name><Text>This shop is unreliable and the owner has no clue how to run his business or care for customers.
Today I had an appointment here which has been scheduled for a week.  I show up today for my appointment and this guy is standing out front.  He lets me know that he has no technicians available and would not be open for business.  The dude is there, why cant he run the test?  It is simple process to perform, but he can do nothing for me despite my reservation.
Upon asking for discounted return visit he hands me the same coupon I already had and intended to use.  And of course he declines to double the discount.
Informed him that my registration is due in 2 days and ask what he can do later, he shruggs.
Mentioned that a phone call would have been nice and he fires back, "We dont take phone numbers, sir."  As if that were my fault.

Why even take reservations?

Anyhow I found another shop a couple miles away that matched his price.

2 thumbs down for 101 Express Smog Petaluma.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>BEWARE, the coupon on the website is a fake and its there to only draw your attention here. There is a "coupon" price for $72 and the normal for $70+. I will avoid here as much as possible for the wrongful business advertising as others are $10-15 cheaper in Petaluma after calling around to 6 other places.<//text><date>1307492715844< /date>< rate>

<text>employee was most unhelpful ~ their "coupon " ends up costing you the same as without one! ~ entirely unprofessional  ~ avoid this place ~ go elsewhere and save your money ~ i couldnt find anyplace that charged as nuch as 101 smog express Petaluma  ~ Boooo!!! And the first two reveiws in my opinion are fakes ~ also not sure how this dump is still getting a 3 star rating ~ the numbers say 2 star which is closer to the one star reveiw this business deserves ~ i feel mislead and will tell NOT to go this place theyre crooks!!!< /text><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

They are very fast and easy.  My only complaint is they do not have a waiting area, but there's a Starbucks that's right in the same area.</Review>

<Text>If your in the Kings Canyon/Clovis ave quadrant, and paying cash for fuel and don't feel like dealing with the lack of space to wait at the Arco down KC, Ricks Sinclair usually has a great price on gas.

Wasn't busy. Staff was friendly. Minus one star due to as soon as I walk into the door, there is a rainbow of balloons that I had to duck under. I hate the smell and feel of latex balloons. There are several people allergic to latex and to walk right into it as you go through the door can cause some issues. Wish I took a pic.</review>

This is my favorite location of all. I live pretty much across the street from them. Drinks are always well done and very good. But, today we got new straw made of cardboard, instead of the regular orange plastic ones. I get they want to help the environment, but, I couldn't drink from it. My drink taste it like cardboard. I was very disappointed since, I couldn't drink it comfortable. So, I was going to go do my errands and decided to go home instead to get a plastic straw from my plastic cups at home. I think they should have both kinds and give the customer the option to choose.<//Text>

Sorry I did not catch your name but shout out to the cashier who understood my pain when I told her my previous visits drink was “watered down/melted”, so she had them make it thick.

My alternator went bad on my 91 Toyota I was expecting it to be a five or six hundred dollar fix went to O'Reilly with the broken one they've bought it from me and then charge me a hundred and fifty bucks for the new one saving me a lot of money that I didn't have other dealerships quoted me at about 400 + installation my dad has been going to O'Reilly since the early 70s and swears it's the best one out there</Review>

I dropped it off at 9am snd was told someone will get to in in 1 or 2 hours. 3 hours later, nothing. 4 hours later and a phone call, nothing. It took three visits and 6 hours to get brakes resurfaced.  There were a few boxes in front of the machine. Work finally got done when I stated I would take it to another O'Reilly down the road that stated it would take about an hour or less. It disappoints me because these guy are closest to my home and I run a home motorcycle repair shop along with some car repairs from time to time so I go to this O'Reilly a lot more than even the home mechanic.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
This place was quick and easy, couldn't have been more happier, Jose there greeted me after working with another customer and I just told him what I needed looked it all up grabbed it from the shelves and I paid and was out of there within about 5-7 minutes, I myself don't know much about cars and he saved me what it would have taken me which would be about 10-15 minutes finding everything I needed. Thanks Jose!< /Review>

A real pity that this store is losing business because of condescending Millenials like her.....sure wish I'd have gotten her name, but I was so disgusted that I just left without buying anything.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Pretty chill spot to get car parts, the employees usually have their hands tied by customers but they still make sure you leave the store with exactly what you came for.<//Text>

Visited here for the VetTV event, A Grunt's Life, and had an awesome time. The post commander and I had a long chat, then I got t to meet the Saluting Marine, Donny O'Malley, the commander of all vfw and his staff and even had a few beers. Wonderful service, great volunteers, and even better events!</Review>

This is a awesome location as well as property. The patio is nice, it has a huge t.v. outside so you can enjoy sports outside holding a cold one. The bartenders all have cool personalities, and they make the drinks taste delicious. Plenty of room inside, nice bar, good beer on draft, even a little dance floor and stage. Active, retired, everyone is welcomed.< /Text>

<Text>Went to the pig roast back on April 21 2013 and had a blast.  The band was putting on an awesome show for everyone.  Everyone was so friendly, just a great place to go and be with friends and family....

I have been back many, many times and this post has become my home away from home and will miss it now that I'm moving away.  There are no better people in the North County area then the men and women who come through the doors of Legion Post 365.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

Great private club for veterans to eat delicious food and enjoy cocktails for way less than mainstream. Nice atmosphere. If you know a veteran who has served over seas, ask to accompany them on a Saturday morning for breakfast.<//text>

Went last night. Had a really good time. I really think I found a new watering hole that my liver will love.  People were friendly and very experienced riders giving a noob much needed pointers in riding. Definitely coming back.</Text>

Great American Legion Post in North County for taking family along or going with friends. Not as many Marines as you'd think in this neck of the woods. Excellent social quarters and bartender staff. Wonderful charities supported from this Post</text>

<Text>I promised some friends that I would pick up food, and although i put in a pretty large order the two gentlemen got to work instantly and had me out of there several minutes before I planned on. The food was delicious and everyone was very happy at the party, I happily recommend the garlic crust, and the stuffed crust for that matter! The pan pizza pack with cheesy bread is a great idea incase someone may not like the specialty pizzas!< /Text>< Pics>

When I called they didnt ask me about what flavor crust I would like. So  I forgot to order the one I wanted. The guy was rushing me when I had questions!  The heart shaped pizzas were a joke for the price the picture in ad was misleading in size!<//text>

<Review>Super rude! As I placed my order over the phone the man cussed to hurry the F up thinking I couldn't hear then when I picked up my order I had my husband's debit card to use for payment and because it was my husband's card obviously I knew the pin but he wouldn't let me use that as payment. So I went to my car to get my debit card and when I came back he told the other cashier to "deal" with me. Horrible customer service! I will order from here again!< /Review>< Pictures>

VERY PLEASED when I first picked up the pizza box I was like what the heck is there bricks in this box seriously it was very heavy so on the way out to the parking lot I dropped my ranch dressing they had given me for my wings they had noticed that it happened and ran out picked up the mess and gave me new ones great service great people clean restaurant. Great people nice bunch of people that work their highly recommended and by the way that pizza was loaded with toppings that's why it was so heavy. Good job gentlemen thank you so much<//review>

Prices are high, and when the food did get here the pizza was stuck to the top of the box and the cinnamon sticks were half burnt and had almost no topping on them, The Howie rolls are ok at best and do not include pizza sauce like the picture shows, you have to pay extra for that, all in all it will be the last time we order from hungry howie, and it also happened to be my wife's birthday as well. Edit: Got a new pizza in place of the messed up one and it looks almost as bad as the original, half the pizza had slid to one side, this is unacceptable as I stated before this is the last time we order from here and suggest nobody else subject themselves to this food.< /Review>

I placed an order online and they gave me a call 10 mins later to let me know they receive my order and will be ready the day I wanted. I got two edible arrangements for teachers day and they looked amazing and delicious. I had my boyfriend curbside pick up and worked out great.<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>This place is a joke. I ordered a Christmas fruit  bouquet for my grandmother online on the 23rd and paid for the delivery fee to make sure that she received her gift on Christmas Eve. She never received it. I called and I kept getting put on hold and then finally someone was able to assist me but was clueless and had told me it wasn’t their problem and to contact Door dash because that is who they have delivering the gift. This is a big disappointment and a waste of time. I would not recommend ordering from this place.< /text>< pics>

What a joke, ordered my stuff online for pick up at the Taylor since i live in a nearby city that they don’t deliver to. I received a call that the order was going to be delayed from morning to afternoon. I was fine with that. When i went to pick up the order the rep said it wasn’t ready if I could come in half hour ok. Then they called to say they didn’t have everything to complete my order that 2 of the 4 would be ready the rest i would have to have ship because they offered  me to pick up from another location in San Jose but I didn’t want to drive all over for this already being inconvenient. The guy gave me apology box took a relatives address to ship local and scheduled for Saturday delivery. Come 3 pm that weekend still no call or delivery so decided to follow up. They didn’t have anything documented and said my order was ready for pick up, smh i had to explain the whole thing the person at the store and she assured my order would be delivered. Close to 5 that Saturday they called saying they needed the delivery address. At that point I was beyond frustrated with the whole situation being a first time buyer on the website and with the edible arrangements I was very irritated and disappointed. My order didn’t arrive until Saturday 10:20 PM and didn’t include two balloons and some popcorn that I ordered so I guess they got over on me after everything is said and done.</Review>

My mom has sent me an arrangement for my birthday that arrived a mess. Edible Arrangements claimed the driver must have dropped it, which could very well be the case  - it looked shook haha. My mom called and they were very apologetic and sent me out a replacement. I am giving 5 stars because they went above and beyond to make this right and the replacement arrangement  was on point. It was adorable and looked like the picture and the fruit was fresh and tasty as well.</Text>

<Text>If your a corporation or business and looking to use this store, think twice and beware!!

I wanted an arrangement for my employee who was having his 20th anniversary working for the company. I asked for a specific arrangement and a nice thank you card, simple enough right??

My arrangement promptly arrived to our business 45 minutes later with no TY card at all. Guess what I received!! An “I Love You” arrangement with chocolate hearts all over it and heart shaped fruits. How inappropriate for a Manager to give to their employee.

So I send it back and asked for this to be fixed. The employee starts telling me that she never received my order etc. etc. If I’ve already received/rejected an arrangement, how is it that you never got my order??

Was any solutions offered?! Absolutely NOT. Now my team is assembled and I have nothing to give on this momentous occasion. So I had to order an additional arrangement and go pick it up myself! That’s right I paid twice but only received 1 arrangement (over $200) and had to get it myself and rush back in-time to present it.

Of coarse I asked for a call back from the store manager... Two days later, I haven’t heard a peep out of them, so now I’m just out of $100 bucks with no solution offered.

Again if you are a business/corporation, I suggest you find another company or use a different EA store because this one doesn’t care about getting orders right or fixing their mistakes.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fcc8406bb5c41:0xff689c5d136d54d8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Placed an order for pickup, and when I arrived at the pickup time they informed me they lost the arrangement for my order and told me to wait while they remade it. I was waiting around the store for nearly 30 min for my scheduled pickup.

Worst part was the complete lack of remorse or empathy for the situation, with only a curt (almost condescending) remark to the effect of "we have a lot of orders right now".</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fcc8406bb5c41:0xff689c5d136d54d8<//Gmap_id><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< user>

DONT ORDER FROM HERE

Would give 0 stars if I could. Basically, tried calling the bulk of the day since I purchased something from them for the holiday.  The phone line was dead all day.  I called at 9pm at night. They said the item won’t be delivered today.

So, with egg on my face I’m forced to say my gift won’t arrive.  Now just want my money back which seems like another chore.<//text>

<Text>Great Customer Service!  I called and spoke with Somella (sp?) and told her I'd had a failed delivery from a competitor and she was able to deliver an order for me within a couple of hours.  Edible Arrangements saved the day and the bouquet was gorgeous.  Thank you!</Text>< time>

A lady on the phone told me oh ma’am your supposed to tell us what time to deliver it. So I said 7pm, I called them at 7pm again after 10 unanswered calls they answered and said oh they haven’t delivered it and will try to make it there close to 7. Needless to say I asked for a manager and was placed on hold for 40 minutes, finally hung up and called back .. after 20 minutes I managed to get a manager on the line ...manager said there’s no guaranteed time slot to when the delivery can be made! I was furious and asked why I was asked
To select a time frame and was told the delivery was on its way. It is now almost 9 my husband still hasn’t received the delivery, no one is answering the phone and no tracking or apology! The worst company ever ! Oh and on the phone I was told if the delivery doesn’t get made they will refund my money ?! Why waste my time and play with my emotions then ? Never ordering from this place again!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fcc8406bb5c41:0xff689c5d136d54d8</gmap_id></record>

It would take too much energy to detail how horrible this business is managed...or should I say, not managed. Plenty of employees, but utter disorganization. Worst of all is they won't acknowledge how disorganized and inefficient they are . They believe everyone should have patience for their lack of timeliness...<//review>

If i could give no stars i would. Worst store I have ever encountered and I've ordered a lot from this company I don't know who runs the store or who owns the store but it was the worst experience I've had with Edible Arrangements ever I ordered on a Wednesday to have delivered on a Monday the next week and get a call 3 hours before delivery that they don't have what I need or delivery driver to deliver it it's my wedding anniversary I did it a week in advance and get a call the same day what kind of customer service is that what kind of business is that but made sure they got my money horrible will never order anything from the store ever again.<//review>

I am from Indiana. I ordered for mom son on Valentine's Day. I called that morning to make sure they got order and it would be delivered. Worker told me yes. My son did not get. I called next day (Friday) she was not sympathetic ...said, "yep what you want me to do". I asked if it was going to be delivered today and refunding $20 delivery fee. She said it would be delivered but they are not refunding delivery. Policy is they would call they never did. Staff said strawberries arrived late and no deliveries went out...so shouldn't you have called per policy? She said nothing.  Guess what? So did not get delivery next day either. So at this moment we are on day three no strawberries but my credit card was charged three days ago. Customer service just has you on hold...I tried three seperate time waiting a total of hour. I am frustrated. I am about to have son go get from store!!!<//text>

I ordered online 12 chocolate covered strawberries for Valentine's day.
They happily took my money. On the day of, they did not deliver the order nor did they post updates to my order online. I spent 1h on the phone on hold to get an update on my order before giving up. I decided to go to the store to get a refund. When I got there, I noticed that some orders where marked 2 days late!
I understand that Valentine's day is a busy day for them, but the service I received was simply unacceptable.< /Text>

I went in to make a change to an order I had placed. Tried to call but the person on the phone couldn't update my order and said to call back  I had to after 1pm. I decided to go in instead. While there I ordered a few cups of fruit to go. Was told 10-15 mins. 40 mins later after having to ask what is going on they come out and say an additional 10-15 mins. Bad customer service and way too long of a wait especially when given a 10-15 time frame when order was placed. Left with no fruit a wasted lunch hour and just upset with the customer service.</text>

I went here today to pick out a arrangement for my boyfriend for his birthday. The only thing that sucked is that they didnt have any birthday cards in stop but the man that helped me this morning was great and nice. He was a lot of help and I couldn't decide what to get so I bought a box of chocolate covered strawberries and a arrangement of fruit. You can say I had pregnancy cravings. :) sorry I ment the one on Monterey and curtner.</review>

<Review>I ordered an arrangement for my wife for Valentine's Day and it didnt arrive, i tried calling during buisness hours and the phone was disconnected, I checked my confirmation email and it said that on holidays orders can arrive as late as 9pm, so when i got home from work at 915 pm i checked and they still didn't arrive. I didnt get an email or a phone call. Worst service ever. I will never order from here again.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Someone told me that Tuolumne means stone houses in native American language,  I guess Tuolumne Meadows means a meadow with stone houses.

However besides the wood lodge built by sierra club in memory of its member Edward Taylor Parsons, I do not find any stone house.

The Soda Springs and Parson's Lodge are the most famous attractions in the Meadows. There is a 1.5 miles trail connected two attractions together.

Soda Spring is just a bubbling soda spring covered by a wood cabin. Till these days animals still drink from the spring to get minerals supplement. So this is warning sign that people shall not drink the water directly

The Lodge is not open to public. and there is really not much to see. Nearby the Lodge is private residence. Just wonder who still live here, considering the Tiago Road is open only several month a year.

The famous pacific crest trail and John Muir Trail meet in the meadow. Personally, I think the  Tuolumne River is the best part of the Meadows.< /Text>

<Text>7/17/2020 It’s lucky to get reservations and come to this place. Just several visitors over there and hiking. I drove this place times but never found a place to parking and always crowd in usual time. Enjoy this peaceful Yosemite time.< /Text>< Pictures>

Simply breathtaking!! I would like to come back time and time again. Nice cool weather (on labor day weekend) when the valley was 100°f. Beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and there are streams cutting the meadows.  We got our kids Park Passports to start recording their times at National Parks.< /Text>

<Text>High country Yosemite! Just about as special, but a bit less crowded and a lot more temperamental. It’s wonderful through the summer, and if you know where to go it can really beat the crowds that stay in the valley.
Great climbing, great hiking, great hanging out on great weather.</Text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Tuolumne Meadows is a gorgeous place, just 6.9 miles from the Tioga Road Yosemite Entrance.

Not far inside Yosemite National Park, after climbing the steep Tioga Pass, you'll notice a massive granite dome, Lembert Dome on your right, which people climb to the top of.  You'll then drive over a bridge that spans the Tuolumne River.  We've parked here, and walked along the sparkling Tuolumne River.  It's definitely worth a stop.

Drive a bit further, and you'll see a store just north of Lembert Dome with a fairly sizable parking lot on the left, where you can buy snacks and drinks, hiking gear, plus any conceivable kind of souvenir- hats, key chains, shirts, post cards, etc.  I once bought a nice Tuolumne Meadows hat here.

Just past the store, you'll notice multitudes of cars parked on both sides of the road, and a vast grassy meadow on the right. You're here!  You can see Lembert Dome, off to the southeast, in the distance.  I've seen lots of deer in the meadow, ground squirrels, and also lots of pretty wildflowers growing along the Tuolumne River.  Be sure and put on some good insect repellant, because the nearer you get to the river, the more ferocious these small black mosquitos get.</review>

Amazing place. Available mostly for camping, so don't expect extra comfort - but definitely worth it.</text>

Words cannot describe.  Unfortunately, more people are here.  Also the campsite nearby creates some haze at times in the area.  It's beyond me why they allow campfires in such a prestine environment.< /text>

< Review>
Absolutely breathtaking. Stunning does not describe it. Toomaloom meadows is the place to be. Chestnut chester and I spent all day bathing myself in lotion trying to become one with nature. Onlookers didn't look very pleased. But I convinced them. Eventually managed to get squishy with a deer. Would come back.<//Review>

Gorgeous Alpine meadow, almost untouched by the tourist masses in the valley.  It’s a bit of a drive and has almost no facilities, so keep that in mind when visiting.  Weather is cool, even in summer when the valley is roasting.  Pacific Crest Trail comes down near here, so you may encounter hikers at the general store. If you’re looking for a short hike, a trip to the soda springs is recommended.  The meadow sits over 8,000 feet in elevation and won’t be open until the snow melts. Ask before you start driving.
Keep in mind that some members of your party may be sensitive to high elevation.  We ended up leaving early due to one person feeling really miserable.</Text>

A welcome respite from the hordes in Yosemite Valley. Flee from the other tourists, and explore the backcountry! Spectacular day hikes (Lembert Dome, Cathedral Peak, Lyell Canyon), overnights (Glen Aulin, Upper and Lower Cathedral Lakes) and weekend (Miller Lake) trips in all directions.

Tip for John Muir Trail hikers: permitting from Tuolomne is much easier than Yosemite Valley. Hike northbound to YV (20 miles, all downhill), return to Tuolomne via YARTS bus, then continue southbound to Mt. Whitney.<//Text>

A plateau located about an hour and a half drive up the mountain road from Yosemite Village. Whereas Yosemite Village is at the bottom of the Yosemite Valley and is overgrown with trees, it is located above the valley and has a vast plateau. It's perfect for a stroll, and it's about 30 minutes one way from the visitor center of Tuor Mimidu to the soda spring where carbonated water springs. There is also a small hut where you can sit down and take a break or eat your lunch.

2017年8月に訪問。ヨセミテビレッジから車で一時間半ほど山道を上ってきた場所にある高原地帯。ヨセミテビレッジがヨセミテバレー(谷間)の底にあり木々が生い茂るのに対して、ここは谷の上にあたり広々とした高原が広がる。てくてく散策するのに最適で、炭酸水が湧き出るソーダスプリングまでトゥオルミミドゥのビジターセンターから片道30分ぐらい。小さな小屋もあり、そこで腰を下ろして休憩したりお弁当を食べたりできる。</Text><gmap_id>0x809659c81b685a59:0xaf3fa8fab18840ab<//gmap_id><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

<review>(Translated by Google) The Tuolumne Meadows are a plateau in Yosemite National Park, north of the valley. It is located directly on CA 120 (Tioga Road) and it is much quieter here than in the valley. You are at an altitude of approx. 2600 m and can take beautiful walks.

(Translated by Google) this is the most suggestive place to admire the sunset, in silence and relaxation. Contemplating the beauty of nature and the sun that disappears between the park peaks. Great for those with a passion for photography

<text>This is such a great park! Lots of grass, lots of big beautiful trees, a toddler playground as well as a larger playground for bigger kids, a small but beautiful rose garden, very nice bathrooms for a public park, picnic tables as well as Street parking on all four sides of the park. Here's some photos of the beautiful roses we saw today.</text>< GmapID>

Wonderful playground for different age groups. My 18 month old loved the area for the little ones and my 6,5 and 4 year old loved the older kids equipment. The bathrooms were clean and they had bathrooms for little kids with the toilets being short enough for them to get on themselves. They enjoyed the kid potty's. A beautiful rose garden to enjoy and plenty of picnic tables.< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>This is definitely a large, well maintained and beautiful park with something to do for all ages. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because when they recently altered the playground all they basically did was remove equipment and shrink the size. Can't say I understand the reason for the change given that the park is huge and kids will always appreciate parks more than adults.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><time>1611683577369</time><Name>Da Boat<//Name></record>

Wide open spaces with tall beautiful trees, wild flowers, and lots of green grass. Great for natural reflection or a pot-luck!<//text>

<Review>Had been years since last at Fuller Park. Used to be kinda unkept looking. Grounds very nice. Decent restroom facilities. Waste cans readily available. Will return again Soon. By the way, I have lived in Napa 67 years out of 71. So familiar with the park:)!!!</Review>< Pics>

<text>Big park in the middle of town. Lots of big redwoods for tons of shade. A great big, fenced in, play area in the middle for kids of all park play ages that has both squishy ground and a sand box, some shade there depending on the hour of the day. A handful of baby swings and a handful of bigger kid swings in opposite sides of the play area. Picnic tables, clean bathrooms that flush and a hand washing area as well as a drinking fountain for all sizes. A few bbqs in the picnic areas and a horse shoe pit.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I loved it because I laid on the ground, napped, was in the shade and in the sun.  That afternoon and the night and the next day I felt entirely rejuvenated, healthy and very light and happy.  Quite a nice experience connecting with the earth.  I highly recommend it, whereever you are.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Nestled in the quaint old neighborhoods of south Napa, this park is open and full of green beauty. The mixture of open space and trees along with a great kids play area make this park family friendly and a draw to the entire community.

This summer the city started third Tuesdays in Fuller Park. Every third Tuesday of each month live music was played from a bandstand. The unique green open space drew a large crowd who felt the magic of the music in the fresh air as it sailed through the green trees. The effect was what makes this park magical.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I haven't been here since I was a kid. A lot has changed since then. The playground is great and maintained pretty good. Bathrooms also. I love how they have signs for people NOT to wear their high heels or cleats on the rubber cement.</Text>

Great park to hike! Hills are challenging and once you get to the top (not even a mile) there are fantastic views. I took my children and we found a wonderful tree to play under, complete with a swing. I could easily spend every day at this park, it's beautiful!<//Text>

Nice City Park, lots of trees and picnic areas. Rose garden is beautiful with the different varieties marked as are a lot of the trees. Only problem is that most of the slides get the direct afternoon sun, so they get really hot.<//text>

< review>
Located in the center of town, this park is a great place for a family picnic or bbq. It has a nice, large play center. Safety is of great concern but not so much here. Fenced in playground and state of the art ground protection is perfect for supervising the young ones. So take a daycation and come hang in the shade!</review>

One of the nicest parks that I have seen for kids, they even have little pottys for toddlers.

Lots of old growth exotic trees and plants, a good stop for a botanist.

The playground has lot of good things for kids and is very clean.

There are picnic areas that can be reserved for partys and BBQ etc.</Review>

Gorgeous park with beautiful playground,  trees and setting. Lots of people walking the perimeter with & without dogs. Dog Owners just need to be a bit more curtious with their animals. If they poop, it must be picked up & disposed in a trash can. Not left on the ground for others to step around.< /Review>

It's the place to take the grand kids to play with other kiddos, preschool age range.  Or reserve an area for a party, or see what's not reserved.  Has that old timey, big tree park feel.  Bathrooms available is a plus.< /Text>

I've never done a review for any hiking parks before..

All I can say it's the views around this place are so breath taking! There are some spots where you can see a whole field of wine vineyards and a cute barn and home. Another side, you'll see an over view of Napa.

We low key got lost while going back down because we wanted to be "adventurous" and we came across a tree that was a part of Calvin Klein panties hanging... pretty fun! (Wonder if it's still there LOL)

We will be hiking here again soon!</Text>

Lovely park situated near downtown in the old residential area. Well maintained with a great playground for kids, picnic areas that can be reserved, and plenty of grass and trees for shade. The city keeps making improvements. The latest is a new bocce ball court.< /Review>

This park is fairly popular. It is great for families, kids, dogs, and adults. It's playground is kept clean and friendly; the sidewalk around it marked with 1/4 mile markings makes it perfect for those wishing to take a quick mile walk at lunch or in the morning; it's very dog friendly, providing plenty of open grass space as well as doggie bags and trash cans to keep things clean; public bathrooms are also provided; and picnic tables are both shaded and sunny, with spots to grill nearby.< /review>

Come see the squirrels, they come right up to you and will eat from your hand. I've been comming to this park my whole life I absolutely love it. It's clean, the grass is fluffy it has bathrooms, and a great play area for the kids. Also great place for B.B.Q's and outdoor get togethers.<//review>

Great little park. You can run laps around the perimeter which is a 1/4 mile. There's a nice playground and plenty of seating. You can reserve group spots. The bathrooms aren't always the cleanest but what can you expect for a public park?</review>

This is a big neighborhood park. It very old and has the trees to prove it. Squirrels are native and plenty of them. Big gated play area for the kids. Lots of BBQ pits and park tables. Markers around the perimeter for the runners.</Text>

Fuller Park has been there since at least the 60s. At my mom used to take me there and they had music in the Parks every weekend was whomever played music! You can rent the tables out for a party or just kick it on a blanket and watch the traffic go by or check out the Beautiful victorians on every side of the block. It has nice clean restrooms, but sometimes it can get dirty. Lots of people go there to play and the playground is nice and big for little kids or big kids. The folks are nice and talkative which makes it nice for parents. I hope this helps</Text>

Beautiful spot in Napa town to take kids for a play break or picnic. The play structures are diverse, good for kids in a range of ages. Also, lots of shade available on hit days.<//Text>

Fuller park is awesome. Swings, slides for kids and great spots for having small parties. Just make sure you reserve your spot or come in before 7 in the morning. There are 4-5 spots with benches, there's a place to bbq at each of them too.<//Text>

Good variety of equipment for kids of all ages and plenty of open area to serve as a buffer between the streets and the play area. The public restrooms appear to be closed part of the year.< /Review>
