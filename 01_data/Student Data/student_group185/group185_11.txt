I believe Dr. Hernandez found his replacement in Dr. Ashizawa: he listened as I described my complaint & after results of lab work, consulted with another physician for a final diagnosis.  Thorough & caring doctor.<//review>

Dr. Ashizawa is just The Best. He continues to earn my respect with his professional yet personable manner. He doesn't just look at you and write a prescription. He asks questions and makes suggestions on how to improve your health. Always a pleasant and informative visit.< /Review>

Dr. Ashizawa is always very personable and very thorough.  He wants to know how or why the injury/sickness happened so that he can treat the cause and not just treat the symptoms.  He truly cares that I am living my healthiest life.</Review>

Love Doctor Ashizawa and Estella.    They are always so helpful.    About 2 years ago if it wasn’t Estella intuitions,  I could have passed away.    She notice that time I looked different than my regular sick look and made an appointment during urgent care ours for me to go see doctor Ashizawa the next morning.      If I would have paid attention to just the urgent care doctor and not Estella.    I probably be dead.     Every time I change insurance I do my best to pay for the ones that allow me to see my doctor.<//review>

It took a month to get a test ordered for a sleep study I needed for my job and I had to call every day for two weeks. The dr is unempowered to do anything and the staff is either lazy or incompetent. I will never go there again. The don't listen to a word you say and never do what they say they will.find another medical group.< /text>

< Review>
Got some painting supplies here and was surprised to see that the prices were not much higher than LowES &HOME DEPOT.Cashier was very friendly and helpful.
Unfortunately I had to park around the corner and drove on a freshly sprayed USA underground utilities locators markings.nowy tires have paint on them .
If your gonna mark the road with spray paint @ least wait untill it dries before you leave it still wet someone can drive on it ASS.----</Review>

<review>Not just the best but the only place to buy hardware and anything else you might need... The staff is very very knowledgeable.
We are a little town Fillmore, California....
Ace hardware store carries everything for us.  This is not a joke!  EVERYTHING!!
Everything you need at a ridiculously low price.  You can buy one screw and two nails and four washers... That's the kind of place this is.  BEST OF THE BEST....

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>They're not the best, but not the worst.  The staff is incredibly helpful, but a majority of their wares are old stock meant to replace very old pieces of household hardware from 30-50 years ago.  They definitely will have screws, bolts, nuts, plumbing, paints, tools, etc, but be careful not to buy a 20-30 year old tool for tree trimming, it will snap.

They honestly need to go through most of their tools stock and mark everything older than 20yrs at 75% off and get some new stock in place.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80e9cc4e66fd0f73:0xe410fc8a01020da5<//Gmap_id><username>Dreph Elatio</username>< Response>

Great place, although they didn't carry the item I needed the day I visited Patterson Hardware they did have a good variety of supplies and found other stuff I needed. This saved me a trip to the nearest major home improvement store. One is 11 miles over the hills and the other is 23 miles down the highway and both have the same travel time, and gas consumption. But Patterson Hardware is doing pretty good in keeping the townsfolk down in Fillmore well supplied.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I’ve researched multiple pet daycares/resorts for my dog and found Red Rover to be the best fit for my dog Spud. They do a temperament test and makes sure your pup is up to date on all its shots. The check in process was quick and easy, and my dog had a specific diet that they were able to accommodate and followed the directions I had given. Everyone at Red Rover are all super nice and professional and are always willing to give me an update on how my dog is doing. I appreciate the access to the viewing cameras they give. I got to see Spud everyday playing with the other dogs! Thanks so much for taking care of Spud!! You guys are awesome!</Review>< pics>

We brought our 2 dogs to Red Rover Pet Resort for a  boarding stay of 10 days. We called a few times to check on them and Red Rover was always very responsive, courteous and helpful. When we picked up the dogs they were clean, happy and very well fed. I would definitely recommend Red Rover.< /Review>

<text>Love these guy. Was so worried about my Shilohs (both Rescues) having a good place to stay when we travel or need some day care. But the good folks at the Red Rover Pet Resort took them in and helped them get socialized with their other guests.  Have been using them for over 9 months now. Love em! Love em! Love em!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoETLS9CGb35AOQJ-YqNVZS7WphPXrKHqJd3hr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHAxn8akX_FhiUertdWMLBzP2N26fetsRnPSnq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ1lGrAeag-ShIuRtJdgc7AilUFJWuT4FC_CAi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Rating>5<//Rating>< user>

BLACKMAILED TO TAKE DOWN MY NEGATIVE REVIEW!!!

First, I want to start by saying I wonder how many other people they have done this to, and that’s probably why you don’t see the bad reviews. What a totally shady company! A couple weeks after writing my negative review, I had to leave town last minute, and unfortunately didn’t have a choice but to book my dog back here for boarding. When I called to make the reservation, everything was fine, they didn’t mention anything to me about not wanting me as a customer anymore. Fast forward to the DAY OF my boarding reservation, TWO HOURS before I was supposed to drop my dog off, I get a phone call from not even the owner, one of his employees Daniel (owner clearly making employees do his dirty work), basically blackmailing me to take down my review or they won’t board my dog. TWO HOURS BEFORE I WAS SUPPOSED TO DROP HIM OFF!!! My reservation had been in the system for a week at this point, so it was clear this was manipulatively planned! I took it down in a panic because I was leaving in the morning and thought I wouldn’t have time to get my dog in somewhere else. But at this point, I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable leaving my dog here, since I was just blackmailed and that is such a shady thing to do. I felt that they would treat my dog badly or worse - hurt him, so I thankfully found another place last minute. But what this company did is extremely unprofessional and the owner is clearly a snake, making others do his dirty work, and using blackmail to fix the reviews for his business. That’s not how you run a business at all. Glad I will never be boarding here again! And to other dog owners - please be careful who you do business with!!!</text>

I'm a few weeks late in my review, but better late than never.  My 2 labs love going to Red Rover Pet Resort. We've been bringing them to Red Rover since they were pups, and are now 7 and 5 years old. We can check in on them via video cam while they play.  There were there in June for a week long stay and had a great time. They were definitely tired when we picked them up, which was great!  Happy Labs = happy parents!<//review>

<review>My pitbull puppy loves it here and goes for daycare a couple times a week. As soon as we pull into the driveway his tail starts wagging with puppy joy. When I look on the cameras from my cell phone from time to time he is having the time of his life, and the staff are taking good care of all the dogs in the play area.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I use Red Rover for both my dog walking and overnight care needs. When my dog needs to get boarded I trust that he is happy and well taken care of at the Red Rover pet resort. The pricing is reasonable for the bay area and my dog always seems content upon return. Would recommend this place!</Text>< userid>

<review>I can't say enough about how fantastic Red Rover Pet Resort is.  I moved to San Jose in somewhat of a rush because I had to start a job within a week, and my biggest concern was finding a place for my 16-yr old dog for 11-12 hrs/day.  I visited a few places and immediately loved Red Rover.< /review><Response>None</Response></record>

I absolutely love Red Rover! My two huskies are excited to go every time, the employees are super nice and helpful, their pet spa left my husky looking fresh and clean for weeks afterwards. My favorite part is that I get to check in and watch my dogs on their remote access camera's. Big love for Red Rover Pet Resort <3< /Review>

<Review>I started bringing my dogs here when I stumbled upon their Instagram page.  I saw nothing but happy doggy faces and I wanted the same experience for my furry beasts.  My dogs are up in age now but as we approach Red Rover it’s like they just jumped out of a hot tub time machine.  I notice a spring in their step and a smile on their face.  I don’t know what all they do inside that place but whatever it is it’s like chicken soup for my old souls.  If your wondering what place to choose I say look no further, you’ve found the right place!< /Review><date>1602085223377< /date>< username>

Expect an interview if you are a first time customer and request for a bath after their stay<//Text>< rate>

Max practically flips for Red Rover pet resort.  His whole body wags when we enter the place.  I’m actually a little jealous because I think he might choose to stay there over coming home with me.  I really enjoy interacting with all the staff especially Renee and Tatyana.  The owner Jeremy seems to be such a great guy and it’s obvious that he has a passion for dogs.   You never even see the owner at most of the other places and I’m proud of the fact that I get to support a family owned business.  I suggest that you hop on the band wagon too, you’ll be glad that you did.</Review>

< Review>
I have used Red Rover several times. I use to leave my dog at Petsmart Hotel. The first few times he went in happy and came out happy. Then the last time I left him, he did not want to go in and stayed by my side. Red flag! I picked him up 2 days later. He smelled like pee, his bed was soaked in pee, his food and toy, were still in his bag the way I packed them and he was lethargic. It took him 2 days to recover and he would never get in a crate again. I don't think they ever took him out of the crate. I paid extra for all day doggie play. I never wanted to board him again. Who knows what they did to him. We had a wedding to go to, out of town. I was so upset I had to find a place to board him. After checking out Red Rover, I was excited to see the huge place they sleep. They are not put in small crates at night. I learned my lesson. I left Toby there on a trial run. He loved it and I was able to watch him on the web cam. He goes in happy, comes out extremely happy and then sleeps for a while. He has been there several times since. I took him to Red Rover for New Year's because he's afraid of fireworks. I was upset and sent an email because I thought I was over charged. They charged me 2 Holiday fees. One for New Years Eve and one for New Year's Day. The owner got RIGHT back to me and explained it to me. It made total sense. He said there was also a sign posted on the  front door which I must have missed. I am one happy fur baby mommy! Thank you, Red Rover for providing a place we feel secure leaving our fur baby.</Review>

<text>Always a wonderful experience with Red Rover. Not only do their friendly dog walkers come by our home during the work week, we rest easy during our annual vacations using their boarding services.

During the shelter-in-place situation, we continue using their services since our work from home situation has resulted in even longer workdays than when we’re in the office. Also, all pet stores with self-service dog wash stations have closed the wash areas. Even our vet stopped providing spa services. Fortunately, Red Rover provides spa days during this time. With all the rain and the muddy trails, our dog really needs a bath to alleviate her skin allergies and prevent the smelly, wet dog odor in our home.

I strongly recommend using Red Rover for your own peace of mind when researching who should care for your furry family member.< /text>< pics>

By far the best dog boarding we've found in the bay area. Just check-out their webcam feed all the dogs are happy, with tons of space to roam around.

Dogs are never caged, with large group sleeping spaces.
Their prices are great, and incredibly flexible with pickup time.

My go-to place for dog boarding during all my multi-day trips. I get a vacation while the dog gets theirs!</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Just like many dog owners, I did research on where I should board my lab for a weeks stay. I was really skeptical of others and just leaving him in general but Red Rover Pet Resort was probably the best decision I've made! They were able to take him in on such short notice and were flexible on pick up days. If you haven't been here before, you are required to bring in immunization records and come in for a tour/interview which shouldn't take too long. Upon pick up, I can tell my dog enjoyed his stay! I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this place!</Review>< Pictures>

<Name>Bubet Tan<//Name><Review>My dogs Ardy and Lendy have been boarding with Red Rover Pet Resort for many years.  The faculty is big and clean with lots of other friends (fur and human) to play with.  The resort has a doggie cam where you can see them make friends, play on the structures, splash in the doggie pool and more.  The play areas, structures, and pools are cleaned daily.  Ardy and Lendy always come home well-cared and ready to rest from all the fun they had.  I haven’t left them for day care, but I would imagine the experience would be just as great. The employees know their guest very well and and show that they enjoy working with these dogs.  Thank you Red Rover Pet Resort for giving my fur babies a place to vacay!</Review>< rate>

Today was first day of doggy day care the AM staff seemed very nice and professional and was able to answer my questions. How ever some of the info was misconstrued I was informed that they spend their day outside unless they need a time out in which they will be removed from play group for 10-15 min. Since clients have access to the camera I noticed there wasn't any play groups outside for aprox 45 mins. I went to pick my dog up and asked oh are the dogs inside and that is when I was informed they take a 2.5 hr nap time. Which is half of the time my dog was there . Then I asked how did she do since it was her first day and the afternoon staff said I don't know. No report card was left , or notes for me to know how she did is upsetting. Then I was proceeded to ask to pay which I paid at the time of drop off. Seems to be a lack of communication and I do not reccommned this doggy day care if you expect your dog to be playing or getting exercise while they are in day care.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I picked up my dog in the afternoon of Dec 25th, 2019. He was completely wet on one side of his body and on the backside in the cold weather. The excuse I got from the front desk was that he probably got wet from the rain earlier in the day. This doesn’t make sense, as there is no way he would have gotten so wet only on one side of his body. Furthermore, I have personally witnessed from the video camera where a worker sprayed water at the dogs with the hose in order to separate them. It’s highly likely that this is how they treated my dog and got him so soaked. This is unacceptable behavior and I won’t ever visit this place again.</review>< pics>

My dog is my daughter. She owns me more then I own her. It's rare to place her in a kennel because she looks at me with those sorrowful eyes saying...."PLEASE don't leave me".
So I have to place her in nothing but the very best kennel so she is as happy as she can be, well cared for and room to move around and meet new furry friends.
I personally went to Red Rover to see how good this operation was and it was a clean, big, beautiful place with lots of space, well thought out with large rooms for nighttime and huge dog runs with artificial carpets, water misters for hot days and even a bathtub for the dogs that like to jump in and play in the water a bit. There are live cameras for worry warts like me to make sure my "baby" is OK and doing well.
The staff is incredible and very loving with all the animals. Even when I came to pick my dog up, she was still going over to them which is unheard of with other past experiences. Once I'm there she wants OUT but obviously she was so well treated and loved that she also was saying that she would miss them too.
Want the very best in a kennel for your dog?
Red Rover IS THE BEST!
Check it out. They are the cutting edge in loving caring treatment of your best friend.
Anytime I require to place her in a kennel it would only be Red Rover.</Text>

Side note-- these dogs are my world, and I try to give them only the best!... this place was not it. First, I paid for a suite so that my dogs would be allowed to board together as well as have their belongings with them (beds, toys, bones, etc.)- none of which were placed in their rooms as directed. Then on the second day, I called to check in on them; I was told they were doing great, eating well, getting along with other dogs, etc. and quickly brushed off the phone. When I picked them up, ALL of their treats and the food I cooked and sent with them, was still in the tupperwares! They only gave them the kibble, which I know they didn't eat without anything mixed in it. :( (spoiled, I know, but it is what it is)  I checked the cameras a few times throughout the day and could see them when they were in the outdoor area. There's a lot of dogs on each side, but they looked fine.. the third day, I kept checking for them to be outdoors during their activity time, and they were NEVER let outside. I called, and they told me they were still sleeping the first time I checked and that they had  late feeding time the second time.  I had my husband call, for a different voice, and they were then honest with him- said they were "short staffed" and that they didn't have anyone to watch them outside-- this is unacceptable!  With the rates we paid, i expected my dogs to have a much better experience- for my dogs to be FED what i bring for them, for them to be accomodated with the BELONGINGS THEY ARE SENT WITH, to get adequate exercise/activity/ BATHROOM BREAKS and to not be blantently LIED to, with no apologies or offer for any form of discount. Will not be a returning.<//Text>< Pictures>

They feed our pups as instructed and respect all animals. They have camera access to watch your pups online also . The business also makes sure animals are up to date on shots etc to insure a healthy environment and keep big dogs and mid to little ones separated. Big pups only if older and mellow.

My dog can be a bit of a loner with other dogs, doesn't really like playing with other dogs.  Red Rover  seems to agree with him though, they make sure no rough housing gets going in the communal play area, they allow some interactions but keep the the wrestling  down to a minimum.   You can check up on the cameras to insure everything is going well.

He was just there again (3/5/2921) for 5 days of boarding and he did fine, checked up on him a few times with the cameras and saw he was happy and getting his exercise. Came home tired as expected. He goes willingly, so he doesn't seem to be bothered by anything that goes on off camera.</Text>

Our dogs are always so excited to go inside when we arrive, they don’t even look back at us! The staff are all lovely, very nice and helpful.

Such a relief that this place exists. It’s great to have found a place where you can see kind, supportive dog-lovers taking care of your pup. The place is clean, spacious, safe. And you can watch your pooch on their outdoor webcams! My dog always comes home happy and nice-n-tired.<//review>

<text>My pup, Gary, LOVES going to Red Rover and always comes out happy, healthy and tired (in the best way). The staff is very friendly and accommodating and it feels like they really love what they do. I've used a few different day care spots in the Bay Area over the years and Red Rover is at the top of the list for being easy to use, fairly priced and well run. Thank you, Red Rover!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><date>1520881001350</date><Rate>5</Rate><Name>David Bottini<//Name></record>

<Text>Great place for daycare and boarding. Nice faux grass dog run with cameras to check in on your pup. Friendly and understanding staff. Dogs seem to get along well and are relaxed in their environment. Daycare is great; no appointment necessary and great rates ($25/half day, $35/whole day).</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We were very nervous about sending our dog to day care, since she doesn't spend much time with other dogs, but the staff at Red Rover in Milpitas made us feel much more at ease. They clearly love dogs and there is always someone with the group of dogs outside. Plus, having the cameras was a HUGE perk, because we could check in throughout the day to make sure our dog was doing well. We definitely will be bringing her on a regular basis!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808fced3b6834bbb:0x8edca5463bfaa9bf<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

There are cameras you can view on the web or through a mobile app so you can check in on your dog throughout the day. Rates are reasonable, I believe, for the service and care provided for your dog.</text>< pics>

<Review>My dog Blue, a very opinionated Border Collie, has been coming to Red Rover Pet Resort’s daycare on weekdays since he was only 6 months old. He is now almost two years old. He loves coming to Red Rover. Every morning he races toward the red door that allows him to join the other dogs in the back. He doesn’t even look back at me. The owner and staff are very attentive and knowledgeable. We also board Blue at Red Rover when we go on vacations. It really is great knowing that you fuzzy family member is safe, happy, and cared for.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

Our 15 month old Ridgeback Luca comes home tired from playing all day and just hangs out, but if we keep him at home he's all fired up by the end of the day when we're ready to wind down.  The best part is that it's very clear all the folks working there are dog lovers and it shows in everything they do as well as in Luca's reaction to them when we drop him off or pick him up.  They know me, know his leash, know to get his lunch container, and some of his habits and personality.  They're also flexible if we need to keep him overnight for a getaway or quick business trip.  They're the perfect solution to our needs as working professionals!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fced3b6834bbb:0x8edca5463bfaa9bf<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Kimchi wags his tail and barks with excitement as soon as we pull up to Red Rover.  The staff seem to really care about keeping our pets happy and healthy unlike a lot of other places that are all about the money.  Red Rover is also a lot cleaner and more pleasant than any other pet resort or Doggy daycare that I've visited.  I'm so thankful that I found Red Rover :-).< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>I will NOT recommend Red Rover Pet Resort to anyone! We brought our dog to Red Rover pet resort for dog boarding. We've been told they will let the dog stay outside for the most of day, but as we seen on their camera they only let my dog out twice a day and less than 5 minutes each time. My dog passed their test before we brought him in for stay which means he can get along with other dogs, but they still separated him from other dogs during the actual stay. They said he got the same amount of the time indoor which I can't see from the camera. I don't think he got enough exercise during the stay because he's still looking for place to do his business after I picked him up. The dog was still wet when I was picking up from the resort, they gave him a bath but didn't dry him off. I took him for bath at several other places before and turned out great each time. After all, I don't think Red Rover is professional at taking care of the dogs and I will not go back there again. Again, I will not recommend this place to other pet owners!<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
We brought our dog here to board for 5 nights while we went on a trip, our first time ever boarding her. The staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions and tried to ease our anxiety about the situation. They showed us how to access the webcams on our phones and told us we could call to check on her whenever we needed too. We never felt the need to because we could see on the webcam that she had a blast! She was always out playing. She came home exhausted from having non-stop fun for 5 days! We had so much peace of mind boarding her at Red Rover and we will definitely continue to board her there and start utilizing their day care services.< /Review>

Update:  I recently changed jobs and had to change day care for Fyona.
That day care closed and I am back at Red Rover because I trust that they will take care of Fyona and she is familiar with everyone.  I drive 20 minutes in the morning and 40 minutes in the evening to drop/pick her off/up.

This is a great place for dogs.  I've been bringing Fyona to this doggie day care for about 2 years.  Fyona is generally a shy and reserved dog but she enjoys coming here.  She loves the staff and I really like the webcams.  I can check in on her throughout the day.< /text>

Katie is an amazing stylist. I only let her cut my hair for the last 10yrs. She is soft spoken and a beautiful person to look at.<//review>

I didn’t think that anyone would be able to do highlights how I want it. And then here comes Jennifer!! She is so awesome! I couldn’t believe it! She takes so much pride in her work and she takes her time. I absolutely love my hair! Thank you so much Jennifer!<//Text>

<Text>Loan cut my hair and she did a great job! It was everything I asked for and I had a coupon for 5 dollars off so my hair cut was only 15 bucks + tip! I would definitely come back again. Call ahead to get your nail on the list so you don't have to wait!< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Went to get a trim and was lucky to get the manager Michelle. My first time visiting and such great service she was even cleaning when I got there! It’s great to see a manager who is not afraid of getting their hands dirty, I will definitely recommend my friends and family, Thank you sooo much Michelle for giving me the cut I asked for!< /Review>

Went to this location and got a great haircut, just what I wanted.
To the guy Greg's comment 2 down.. Going and getting a haircut and not getting enough off is like going to a buffet and leaving hungry, its your own fault.<//text>

Use to come here every 2 weeks when I lived near by. Always on point. Always happy with great conversations. I was sad to leave them behind. I still haven't found a salon that takes care of me like them.<//text>

<text>Got a trim here with Alexa and she did a fabulous job. Cleaned up my layers really nicely, made my bangs look even better, and gave me a great blow dry on my fine hair. She also gives good head massages during hair washing. Ask for Alexa, she cuts great!<//text><user>103668436985596083697<//user>< user_name>

<Text>Supercuts STILL leaving more hair to get you to come back sooner.
I've known that Supercuts leaves more hair on the top and back of your head to make you come back sooner for well over a year.  But I foolishly went to this different Supercuts yesterday and was again disappointed at their unwillingness to provide an adequate haircut.  Honestly, I blame myself for coming here after I should have absolutely known better.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dcdf5e98a93373:0xa9983e48939a50cd<//GmapID></record>

This was my first time going to Supercuts and it was a great experience. I usually go to 18/8 and pay twice as much. I will not go back to 18/8 after getting a better haircut and color at Supercuts. My stylist was ViVi and I would highly recommend her to anyone. Thank you<//Review>

5 stars ! Really cheap pricing and honestly one of the best haircuts I've had in a while . Last time I went to a " luxury salon " the lady had no idea how to cut or use a machine on the sides . Here they did a fantastic job . Rather than 40 dollars a hair cut it was 19.25 . Great price .</Text>

Black underneath and yellow on top...and if I don't use conditioner it wadded up in a rats nest.  I specially told her the last thing I want is dark highlights and she gave me black....

Maybe she's color blind......and I actually had to pay for this ugly mess....< /Review>< pictures>

I would leave a zero if i could this place is horriable. Went to get mys sons hair cut they said 5 minute wait well that turned into 20 and the dirty looks was everywhere. Needless to say after 20 minutes we left and went across the street to floyds. OMG such a better place they took us in right away smiles and good vibes all around.<//Review>

The lady that works there is always so nice. They give you a to go box stuffed with whatever you order for about $10 each. Everything I tried is so good except the Mongolian beef but I only like it from a couple places so might just be my taste buds. Also the broccoli beef is mostly broccoli so I don’t get that anymore but everything else is great and good portions.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Food is very fresh and very good. Cooked just right and tasty.  Sauces on different dishes are distinct, which is great.  Prices are very reasonable. The best Chinese food I have had in a long time.< /review>< pictures>

It’s been more than a year go over there and never had a problem or any disappointment & lots of menu choices if u like to eat different kinds of foods.

Walnut prawns were more batter than prawn,  General Tsos chicken was doughy, and mu shu duck was really gross and served with FLOUR TORTILLAS instead of mandarin pancakes.  The fried rice was edible but bland and the rice was mushy and lumpy.   A truly horrible meal.  Be nice to yourself and go anywhere else.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>1</Rate>< Resp>

True the restaurant is quiet, it's because no one wants to go there.My husband and I went there with my sister who seems to frequent it, so they know her, food was good BUT when my husband and I went alone the food and service was a minus 10. They were rude, we felt like they just wanted us out, we were interfering with there rest, talking among-st themselves. This last time we thought we would give them another chance, NO, it was worse then the last, food was no different then a generic Chinese fast food. UGH. No flavor, no feeling of -Hey, Let us make you feel welcome, you are in our home so we will cook like you are family, if that was the case i'm sure things would be different, especially the food and atmosphere. I would NEVER recommend this place, and believe me there are places and services that are horrible, yet there food is great and in those cases I cal in and order food to go. BUT  New Ocean's service and especially the food is worse than worse. Please DO NOT go to

I went there tonight for the first time and I absolutely love it.Everything was delicious and the service was great as well.Contrary to a previous comment,I didn't have any language barrier issues. And the Egg Foo Yung was just right,with just the right amount of beans sprouts.It's convenient and definitely a do over.< /Review>

Chinese food is there specialty and they do a great job at it, however the portions are not big enough for the prices you are paying.<//Text>

We had some pan-fried noodles and egg fu yong. The sauce for both were really starchy and not recommended. The noodles was crispy and nice but oddly the egg fu yong was mixed and cooked together with bean sprouts, which we were not used to. It was quite affordable though.< /Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The owner of this restaurant is probably Taiwanese. The dishes are mainly from Guangdong province outside the mainland. There is also a small amount of Cantonese food and very spicy food. There are not many guests and parking is convenient.

(Original)
這店老闆大概是台灣人，菜是大陸廣東省外的菜為主，也有少量粵菜，還有很辣的食物。客人不多，停車很方便。</Review><gmapID>0x808fbf1dfba70cf9:0xa453b83ba3709e1c</gmapID><username>XianMin Tang< /username>< date>

<name>Gertrude Vaughn< /name><pictures>None</pictures><text>This place is so adorable!! It's decorated nicely (very cutesy and aesthetic) and feels homey. This is definitely a great place to sit and chat with friends or get some work done. There is not a ton of seating inside, but there is a generous amount of seating outside. The store is clean and the employees are kind and helpful. I ordered their white peach oolong tea with agar pearls which was a very nice drink. I am typically iffy about ordering agar pearls, but SHARP,s agar pearls were delicious. The tea itself was refreshing and flavorful. To me, this cafe is a bit pricier (my drink was $5.37 including tax) considering the size of my cup was on the smaller side. Nonetheless, this place is definitely worth a try and I would want to pay a visit here again.< /text>< user>

Hands down the most amazing customer service. This team does good on boba, and the fact that they have air pancakes is an extra delight, as sweet as they are with their customers. A must visit for boba whenever you are in Weller Court.< /Text>

I have been waiting for a place near me that has Japanese soufflé pancakes and I seriously hit the jackpot moving here. They recently just opened and was sent here after asking a couple of people in little Tokyo if they existed around town. Seriously though I was so emotional it was the BEST thing ever. Lots of vids and pics and tears. I love this place. FINALLY JIGGLY PANCAKES!!!< /Text>

<review>for a place w a sign that says boba and air pancakes, youre more likely get boba unless ur willing to wait two hours for the next round of cakes. they don’t even sell you a single cake if they have one more from the last batch you’ll still have to wait. i would have appreciated a better explanation then two teenage workers trying to muffle their method for making pancakes efficiently then just reading it on the door outside. honestly just a lame experience especially when the lady who already called my order, calls it twice and screams in my ear after she knew i was waiting for my second drink.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Small boba shop in Little Tokyo in the same plaza as Marukai.
The drinks we got were very refreshing and came with plenty of ice! Perfect for the 90 degree day we were out there.
The mixed fruit tea and dragon tea were sooo good! We weren't expecting much tbh since I honestly don't think the boba game is strong out in Little Tokyo but this place makes it to the top out here!
The not so good: The mixed berry tea was really disappointing. Light in flavor but tasted like medicine. Skip this one!
Sweetness: We adjusted to 75% sweet and they were perfect. The tea flavor is strong but not overpowering and bitter.< /review>

Very unique drink menu with specialty drinks! Their match toffee with boba was good and went well with the third culture bakery match mocha muffin. The ear grey tea was a miss and tasted more like chocolate, but wasn't terrible. I had asked for it to come with no ice but had ice in it.</Review>

Tried their Green Tea Lemonade & completely fell in love with it. Its not overwhelmingly sweet as I had thought it would be which made me enjoy it. The long cups are interesting & they do add boba to all their drinks when you ask. The service is kind & prices for a place in little Tokyo are friendly!

I got a boba milk tea and pancake. The lid to the pancake wasn't on and I accidentally dropped it. My friend asked if they would make another one and they responded very short and cold saying if we wanted another one, we had to be charged for a whole other pancake which is 11$ by the way. Poor customer service.</Review>

<Review>We got the Match Toffee with oat milk and Creme Brûlée with regular milk and both were super delicious. I couldn't stop taking a sip of the Creme Brûlée- I think it's officially my favorite drink.

My Wife normally goes to Boba Guys but I think this is going to be his new favorite spot. Hoping to try the House Milk Tea next!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Definitely a hole in the wall type of place,  but it's worth the hunt! The boba flavors are standard but executed well.  The air pancake was a 20 minute wait but so worth it.  They're so light and airy! They're served in a tall paper bowl/cup so taking a picture of their true altitude is kinda tough.  I'll definitely be back for more.<//text>< Pics>

Amazing service and quality of drink. Only problem is that I found a aluminum string when I was halfway in the drink. I'm surprise the string was there, since the place is clean and organized. I've been a local for SHARP TEA and I'm kinda disappointed in the aluminum string. Only recommendation is for them to clean and check their stations for anything that's not normal.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>This place is fine but after all its just a diner without any spectacular decor/vibe/food.  We came here after visiting Descanso Gardens and had zero problem finding parking behind the buildings.  We were seated immediately because it was lunch time and apparently this place is known for breakfast.  I scanned the menu and found everything to be ordinary (sandwiches, panini, basic salads, soups).  Ended up getting their salmon salad which was good but not very large and I was hungry 1 hour later despite spending $14.  The zucchini bread that came with the salad was worth 4 stars in itself.  Service was very good but the food is just ok.  I would come back here to try their breakfast but I think I am good with lunch and dinner.</Review>< pics>

Came in on a weekday in the evening for hot chocolate and WiFi, the guy at the front was super chill and the place was playing awesome music. Awesome as in, it's not just piano, but it was some playlist of cool songs in relaxing-versions. That's the best I can describe it.
The WiFi was good connection.
And the hot chocolate was  tasty! Maybe because I don't usually eat or drink sweets but this was good.

Ample parking and no wait in line.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This isn't the best SHARP TEA place I've ever tried, but it's also never disappointed me!
I usually stick to my thai tea with SHARP , but this time I decided to try the strawberry matcha and I'm so glad that I did. The flavor of the strawberry was perfectly sweet and not fake tasting at all. You couldn't taste the matcha as much, but I feel like that's expected from a chain.
Like I said, I always get their thai tea and I love it. It might be a little too sweet sometimes, but still very refreshing. I've also tried their strawberry and banana smoothie with lychee and ohmy that was amazing too!
I like this place because none of their flavors are overpowering but yet they still give you a solid SHARP TEA option if you're in the area and looking for a drink.</Text>

A hidden gem ✨ I really liked their Brown Sugar & Pink Panther series. Pure fresh milk plus brown sugar, fresh taro, or what have you - that’s way better than ordinary bobas! Check them out. P.S. The staff I met were very nice.</Text>

So for a time - there was TeaShot, and it mixed the standard Milk Tea concept with some other desserts like cookie shots and I think maybe some pastries and the like. It was okay, but it didn't make it, as seems to often be the case in Weller Court. TeaShot has now been replaced with Sharp Tea which is, also, just okay.

The below are points of reference for this review given the prevalence of Milk Tea in Little Tokyo:

Twinkle Brown Sugar: Five Stars
Gong Cha: Four Stars
Little Fluffy Head: Four Stars
Boteaga: Four Stars
Milk+T: Three Stars
TeaShot: Three Stars

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

They're simplified the concept here at Sharp Tea, which I think is an improvement over TeaShot. You've got Milk Tea and a few other specialty beverages, and then fluffy air pancakes that they whip up as a dessert. The service is fast and friendly. Star.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$5.00 got me a standard Sharp Milk Tea, which is a fair price. Star.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

First and foremost, I love the customization that's available at Sharp Tea. It baffles me that some Milk Tea shops don't allow you to customize the sugar or ice content, so kudos to Sharp Tea.

Having said that, this Milk Tea was just okay. You should know that their Milk Tea's default temperature is pretty warm, so I wouldn't advise going below the standard quantity of ice. They go heavy on the sugar, so my 75% was just right. As for the boba? It was fine. Better than say Milk+T in my opinion but not as good as Boteaga or Twinkle Brown Sugar. Single Star.

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

Sharp Tea is good, but I just don't think it's as good as some of the endless competitors nearby. No Star.<//review>

I had the best level of service and storage at a very reasonable price. After searching multiple places this was the best. Most importantly  no issues with security and a very  convenient place and time that was best fit for me. I would highly recommend Extra Space Storage<//text>

I performed  HVAC work at this site and the staff was very friendly, very knowledgeable,  maintained  a clean environment,  practiced  social distancing, everyone  wore masks and made me fee safe at their facility.  I was offered cold water as it was very hot today.  This type of hospitality is rare to find these days. I would recommend friends  and family members to patronize this extra space storage  location.  It is a large facility  and offer lots of options for all your storage needs. Two thumbs up for sure...<//Text>

<Text>Quick and painless. Clean and easy to access storage readily available.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff.

Update:
Checking out... 5 months later...oh man! Nothing but good stuff.  It was really easy for the movers to get in and pick up all my things since the lanes are so wide and everything is all on the ground level.  I had to fly out ASAP and wasn’t able to stop by the office to check out, but they were already tracking and took the initiative to close out my account and email me the confirmation.  Having that peace of mind clear across the country while still having to conduct military virtual training, homeschooling, civilian job responsibilities, Single-mom duties... I can’t thank them enough.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
This move got to be so stressful for me that I couldn't think and was in tears. When I first saw Melissa I thot, oh no I don't think I can handle it if she gets short with me. But then she made eye contact and was so sweet. She kept being sweet to. I was a wreck and she kept telling me that I was ok. She made a difference to me and that's a big deal. I'm very thankful and very glad I landed here where I feel safe. Thank you Melissa and thank you extra space storage!
Sincerely,

Carley Ravicchio< /Review>

Great customer service came in on Friday and Stacy was a great help with showing units, then there computers had issues which is not her fault, Stacy tried her best to fix the computer issues but we needed to come back the next day. Stay assured us that the unit we wanted would be held for us and come back the next day and Melissa Mattis help us with the finishing of us retaining the unit space. All in all great customer service and very helpful. Will highly recommend this place to all that ask.</text>

I have absolutely nothing bad to say. They are great. Always friendly and helpful.  I love the main manager as she's always friendly and remembers my name. Place is well kept and secure. Totally recommend them.  And I just bought a house and moved out so I have no incentive to leave them a good review except to be honest that they are cool.</Text>

I had reserved a unit online after office hours and the next day I met with Melissa, who was so helpful, friendly and extremely knowledgeable, and she has a fantastic personality!
The location of this facility is
perfect for me.  2101 Sylvan Avenue, Modesto, CA. The property is very clean and secure.  My experience here has been a wonderful one.< /Text>

We are currently in between houses and have a spot here. A month back I had let the woman working know that there is a BAD wasp problem in our area of the storage. I have gone back a few times since then and there is still a bad wasp problem.. that seems like it’s gotten worse. Hopefully we won’t have to deal with this storage for too much longer.<//review>

I cannot express enough how wonderful the folks at Extra Space are. Melissa & Abby don't just work there, they are people that have become friends over the years. They are consistent, professional, supportive, & friendly. Thanks ladies, I appreciate all that you do!

It is worth every penny to have your storage grounds clean (I've seen Melissa taking down wasp nests herself!), safe, and with reliable people that are always on site. If you are looking for a storage spot you can trust, this is it folks.< /Text>

I have used storage units for the last ten years all over California and Nevada. The professional and personable demeanor the ladies showed was always noticed and impressive. The area was clean and inspected at all times. The ease and flexibility of moving units or paying kept me there longer than needed. The truck was a nice touch that helped keep money in my pocket. I will not hesitate to use them again for my storage needs.</Text>

Excellent experience renting a storage unit at this facility. Josh was extremely helpful and friendly and took the time to help me decide the correct size unit I needed and gave me a really great deal. The facility is very clean and very user friendly. I love the convenience of the location, the hours of accessibility, and the free use of the moving truck for moving in. Would definitely recommend!< /Review>

<Review>Abbie & Melissa are absolutely amazing. I have a horrible time making my payments on time & the girls make sure to give me a courtesy call before I am charged a late fee. They are always very friendly and helpful when it comes to my questions or concerns. I recommend Extra Space storage to anyone who doesn't have the extra space at their home. Best customer service, hands down!!!! 👐👍<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Melissa has been such an amazing help to me in my moving process.  I've had to delay, change and adjust my reservation and coming in today was so easy.  Melissa is an asset to the customer, especially with her quick knowledge base of the units.

<Text>Close and clean and when we walked into the facility it smelled great. Melissa helped my bestie with just the right space and was very professional and helpful. Unless you have had issues or have rented space from bad places you never know how good it feels to have a clean safe and helpful facility so don't take it for granted because some places are not as nice<//Text>< rating>

Josh didn't have a unit available for us, but he set us up with the riverbank location and got us a great price! He is very helpful and the site was nice and clean. Wish they had a unit for us, but it's ok. We stayed with ESS and he helped us out! Thanks Josh!</Review>

Paid for $55 gasoline and they were not allowed me to use the restroom  👎🏼 . I was expecting a quick bathroom break on my delivery route. Anyway, folks who want to take your break I would recommend you guys use 76 gas station which is nearby and Staff is more friendly in Seven11.</Text>

The pump attendant working in this gas station has been doing an excellent job in providing oil services to people! They are always prompt and reliable when it comes to gas refills or any vehicle issues. Highly recommended service!</Review>

<username>Matthew Ott</username>< Review>
Got gas and a car wash, which left my car covered in streaks of dirt and water, which I had to wipe off with a paper towel. I went inside to use the bathroom, after spending $50+ and they said that the bathroom was “out of order” due to COVID-19. I went to use the air pump, and someone had parked in the spot and was nowhere to be seen. I’d use this gas station as the last possible resort.< /Review>

<text>I am rating this based on their car wash service. Even the premium wash did not clean the simple dirt off my hood, and the top. Also I noticed that it does not have clear signal as to when to enter the car wash zone after you pay.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>For a quick automatic car wash in a convenient location, easily accessible this is the first place that comes to mind for the SF local driver. The site is always clean, and there is a self service vacuum station. Usually it is not busy, longest car wash wait is less than 10, if that. I usually go here for a quick wash, not for more involved detailing.</Review><Time>1358209433263< /Time><UserId.>101470643786024398871< /UserId.><gmapID>0x808f7e5d7b8eedc1:0x68e42f86124b886a<//gmapID>< name>

All the employees were so kind and helpful, it was my first time there and I been going ever since. I love the car wash AND coffee loyalty cards after certain amount purchased,  you get a free car wash/coffee..also lots of supplies and snacks for sale...Good amount of space to park or manuver cars. Oh yeah..great coffee with plenty selections of creamers and clean location all around, including the restroom.<//Review>

<review>Easier than it looks to get into - AT LEAST IN A CAR - during construction. Sure is expensive and I say it is one of the least sketchy gas stations in San Francisco. It sure does suck to go to San Francisco low on gas.< /review>< Pics>

it’s 4am and it’s most definitely NOT OPEN 24 HOURS. i tried paying inside since my card wasn’t read by the machine and it was locked with the clerk cleaning inside. he saw me too so i’m confused about this being “open 24 hours”</review>

This car wash is the best I have ever used. The cheapest choice, "express,"  gets the car very clean.

Other automatic washes skimp on detergent, and don't get all the dirt off.< /Text>

Decent prices, lots of pumping stations (seldom  congested like the lower priced stations) plus a care wash make visiting this station stress free and convenient, wildly rare in SF.</Text>

<review>Its clean.  If you get a car wash you can pay for gas and get it for $6 or have to get $1 in gas to get car wash for $6. If you just buy a carwash its $7. Why pay them an extra $1. Its not like the car wash is a better 1.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>Martin provides excellent service. Even during a pandemic he humbly speaks to his customers about what to expect such as wait time and seating. He knows hair and will advise you on what YOUR hair is capable of. Price is also very reasonable. Support your local business.<//Text>< Date>

Walked in to see my usual Lady (Ana) that cuts my kids hair.  She wasn't there and the staff wouldn't give any information.    Someone other lady cut my kids hair, I was not happy at all!  She wasn't friendly, service was bad and the cut was bad as well.   To bad to see a shop go downhill.  Bad Service, I wont go back!   Don't waste your time</review>

<review>My husband called for an opening, Martin took him right away. Came home with an excellent hair and beard cut. We have tried so many local places. Martin is definitely the best. We will be returning!< /review>< pics>

My husband went in for a hair cut today 10 minutes before they closed and Martin took him in right away. My husband was very pleased with the job that was done, he has always has issues finding someone that does a good job and Martin is his new barber.</review>

<Review>My boyfriend went to another local barber shop and the barber was new and messed up his hair. He then went to Friendly Barber and said the barber there fixed his messed up hair cut. And did a really good job. He will now be going back there from now on  and taking our sons there for haircuts too.<//Review><Date>1571103750168<//Date><Name>Korina Janelle</Name><userid>114256491448443204674</userid><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

I came in into this public storage asking a variety of questions, and the employee named Adri was able to help me with said questions and made the option of renting a space very easy, I would have been confused and lost if it were not for her help. thank you Adri!</text>

Easy move-in and great customer service. Julio (public storage rep) was very friendly and super helpful. Considering I had to change my appointment he found the time and patience to help me rent the space. The facility is very clean.</review>

I really needed a storage today. Raquel went above and beyond to look for the right size for me. She checked other locations and because of her excellent customer service I decide to go with the larger storage in her facility. In the midst of all the stress that I'm moving this was a very pleasant experience she provided....< /Text>

The property manager Myrna was very helpful with my move-in. I had an appointment for later that day, and called I called her hours before that time asking if I could change it to an earlier time. She was very pleasant and paperwork was done very fast and efficient. Her skills and customer interaction is superb.< /Text>

My wife and I just moved from another state and we ended up needing a storage unit so I called Public storage and they suggested this location. We met Myrna and she was so AWESOME! She was so nice and professional. We got the impression that she really cared about her customers and took pride in her service. Definitely a wonderful experience getting us set up with everything. I would HIGHLY suggest this location for a unit because of her being the property manager. Thank You Miss Myrna!!! You Rawk!< /review>

Myrna helped me beyond my expectations...
Now a days,customer service people are in such a rush,  but Myrna really had the patience and answered all my questions profesionaly and eloquently.
My hat off to Myrna, you made my decision to come back and do business with you!< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>The crazy lady there has a very rude, bad attitude. We complained to her manager but never received a call back with a formal apology or even to say he's spoken to her. Her rudeness is/was inexcusable.
She needs a class in customer service like "now". Because of her attitude, I'm done with public storage. I've been using them for 3 years but I'm taking my business elsewhere. I'm not recommending you or anyone to utilize this place. It's not worth it.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

They accept reservations for indoor and outdoor seating. Their outdoor, rooftop patio is gorgeous and equipped with heaters. The customer service is excellent, along with the atmosphere. The food was savory and well-seasoned. One of our friends is a bread-a-holic and rated their bread one of the best he's ever had. Even the clam chowder was delicious! This is a must go. It's a little on the pricey side, but 100% worth it. Try the Salmon and lasagna. Enjoy!</review>

Outdoor seating feels like you’re in a treehouse with the elevated balcony. We were told to wait 20 minutes for a table but were seated almost immediately. Nice bathroom!

COVID wise: servers wore their masks but didn’t enforce guests at all. Tables were very close together with little to no distancing.

Menu was only 2 pages long but had a variety of cuisines such as burgers, thai curry, pastas, and spanish paella.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

He helped us get our stroller up the stairs, and was very accommodating to our family. He stopped by our table to ask how the food was even though he was not our waiter. He was kind, happy, polite, professional, and extremely hospitable. We will go back just because this guy was great. Great service and great food.

The ambiance, outdoor seating, heaters, and lights were great. All around a 5-star place to dine.<//Review>< date>

We also had pasta and red thai curry, which were both just okay. The garlic bread was a pleasant surprise and I'd totally recommend it.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Amazing outdoor dining.  The Seafood Paella was a very large portion - perhaps meant for sharing.  The shrimp were giant!  Baklava was delicious and DH says they have the best Clam Chowder.  We came on a Friday late afternoon around 4pm and we were seated right away.  All employees were smiling under their masks (I could see it in their eyes)  It was perfect!< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Excellent restaurant, unfortunately only takeout at present. Our take out dinner a couple of nights ago was very good. Probably the best lamb I have eaten in a very long time. The owner ws very pleasant and helpful. It's slightly on the pricier side, but typical of Carmel pricing, however the food was absolutely worth it. We will order again from them before we leave Carmel in a few days.

4/10/21 update.

Had the opportunity to visit this restaurant again, but this time for indoor dining.

My review thoughts have not changed. This is a very very good restaurant. The menu is quite eclectic, from Thai curry to steak to kebabs. I once again had the lamb kebabs, and once again they were outstanding.

The wait staff service was also very good.

Should be very high on any Carmel visitors restaurant dining list<//Text>

Treehouse was recommended by the sommelier at one of the wine tastings we went to. It was a great rec - small family-owned restaurant with a wide variety of food options. The family is consistently checking in on guests.

I got the lamb stroganoff and my partner got the shrimp pasta. Both were good, but would probably try something new off the menu next time! The sommelier highly recommended their curries. One of the best parts was oil mixture they served with bread and no corkage fee if you bring Scheid wine!</review>

We ordered grilled sea bass and grilled salmon. Both served piping hot. Both very good. We also ordered a Greek salad which was good. We had mango raspberry cheese cake and baklava for dessert. Both were good. Overall, great service, great food but very expensive. But I guess, in Carmel, that may be expected.</review>

<Review>I’m not going out on a limb by recommending the Tree House Cafe in Carmel. The staff are nice, friendly and very attentive. The food delicious, heavily portioned with nice pricing.
Ambiance, inside or out is perfect. Try it.< /Review>< pictures>

Ordered the sea bass but they served mahi mahi. I figured that was an acceptable swap and ate it. Mistake. The fish was past its prime and I had food poisoning for a day and a half. Staff was very nice though.< /Text>

Great location. Beautiful trees and the front garden is great. Came in only for a glasses wine on a Saturday night at 7:00. Obviously very busy. Friendly service and a good wine by the glass selection. Loved this place, will definitely be back.< /Review>

<text>Perfect cozy atmosphere, off the main streets of carmel-by-the-sea. Their pasta is made fresh from a lil pasta spot right next door. The Spanish Paella was delicious! Finger-licking good. Perfectly paired with the dreaming tree wine. Also, we were lucky to be given free dessert. (Thank you, treehouse!) The baklava was beautiful! Loved our girls trip here. We'll definitely be coming back!</text>< Time>

Food ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Service ⭐⭐⭐
Personal Touch ⭐⭐

Restaurants are like love affairs. It doesn't have to be perfect, but some things will make it last.

We came from a far to visit this restaurant. We waited about 40 minutes for a table. Met Fadi, the Jordanian entrepreneur who owns the restaurant. Very pleasant.

The food was absolutely delicious. The sauces were just perfectly done, not overly creamy, just the right consistency. The food combinations were awesome.

The server didn't recommend any appetizers. Went from drinks to main course. When asked about the Ravioli special vs. the seafood pasta, he said he liked both but couldn't recommend one over the other. So I ordered both. Though the owner knew we came from a far and it was to celebrate a birthday, there was no effort to make the birthday girl's evening special.

The server only visited the table just once since the order. The owner didn't visit any tables while we were there.

We would have ordered dessert and wine had the service was better. This is where the relationship part come in. We would have gladly spent a lot more money, but went elsewhere for dessert and wine.

There was a table of 4 next to us who just had water, no dessert, but was googling where to go from there. Missed opportunity.

There are many great restaurants in Carmel. We come to Carmel often. We come for that special Carmel experience and service. I hope Fadi realizes that it's a privilege to have customers, not a privilege to eat at his restaurant. Make the customers feel amazing and they will return even if the food missed a beat that day or on that dish.

Great potential at this location and at this restaurant. Keep the kitchen staff, but change the attitude, spend more time taking care of your customers. Get to know them. They will come back. They will spend more money per check. They will be more forgiving.<//review>

We celebrated my birthday here. Daniel - our server has given us 5 stars service. He made us feel so welcomed. Excellent Mediterranean food, Greek salad was freshly made with care. The grilled calamari was so delicate( although I wished they actually would grilled it instead of battered it). Very delicious though.
The chicken kabobs was tender, juicy and very flavorful( I’m very picky when it comes to chicken kabobs). Treehouse Cafe got this down.I would come back again on my next trip.<//text>

Lovely little roof top oasis. My only complaint is that some seats are directly in the sun and everything is crammed in a little tight on the balcony, but I'd absolutely go back - with sunscreen.</Review>

The Treehouse Cafe has exceptional chowder and the Thai sausage is delicious, too. We scored a bottle of fantastic red wine as well for a great discount. Service was great.< /Text>

<Review>Small and cute with lots of food options! They manage expectations with realistic waiting times. They'll also give you take out options instead of waiting about 30-45 min on a weekend (even a rainy weekend).</Review></record></dataset><record>

What a darling little restaurant with amazing food! I didn't have high expectations and they blew me away. The bread is phenomenal. And the pasta bolognese and beef stroganoff were the best we've ever had!

Just as important as food was the ambience. You fill like you are sitting on a little rooftop in Europe. The service was friendly, quaint, and intimate.

Will definitely be back!< /Text>

<Review>This place made our night! We had a great experience. Beautiful and cozy balcony. Very friendly and helpful stuff. Food was delicious! I ordered Lamb kebab, it did not disappoint. Just like the rest of the food that our group ordered. Very pleased, definitely coming here again on our next trip to Carmel. Thank you Treehouse Cafe for a warm welcome and memorable experience.< /Review>< date>

Treehouse Cafe is fantastic. The terrace is beautiful with the sound of a fountain in the background, La Vie en Rose on the surround sound, mimosa in hand with a prawns cessar salad for brunch. Doesn’t get much better than this on a sunny day in Carmel! Service, atmosphere, and food were wonderful.</text>

<Review>Great food. They are working under their social distancing rules, and obviously trying hard. All the servers and bussers wear masks.

I recommend making a reservation earlier as they are very popular in weekends.

The Calamari is really good. It's not your classic small rings. In stead it is a slab of high quality squid that is breaded and cooked. My wife doesn't like calamari, and she loved this. It was not chewy at all.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Absolutely loved the location and charm of this place - very cool patio and indoor area also. Did not love the food, unfortunately. Our dishes were very bland with flavor, although they were well-presented and filling.
Staff was completely lovely, but our server seemed a little disappointed that I ordered a soda instead of wine.
Bear in mind I’m a simple man of simple tastes, so upscale places aren’t my forte, but hopefully this review can help another in my situation.
Overall, I’d 100% recommend this place to a trendy, spendy friend looking for a new experience because it’s really neat. But I would not go back myself because I prefer taste and value to atmosphere.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Loved their wine (heavy pours) and had a great appetizer and bread! But unfortunately when my friend went inside to go to the bathroom she overheard one of the managers talking about very controversial political opinions! While we had different political stances, I'm okay with it but try not to talk about it in front of paying customers. Especially when she was saying some offensive stuff :(<//text>< Pictures>

Loved the ambiance. Cute and intimate seating indoors as well as outdoors. The staff was very attentive. Their Mediterranean with Italian options went very well. The flavors were authentic to their respective cuisines. They have a good collection of alcoholic beverages including non alcoholics beers as well.< /Text>

My husband and I have been here twice. Last time I had the smoked salmon sandwich- it was everything you would want out of a salmon sandwich. We also had the dolma appetizer, which was pretty up there with some of my favorite dolma. This time we had the goat cheese and honey with crostini and my husband had the chicken pesto sandwich and I had mussels as an entree (I scarfed them down before I remembered to take a pic. Whoops!) also the patio is the best seating in Carmel. It does fill up very quickly, because it’s a pretty small place!</Text>

Amazing ambiance, intimate setting with a great vibe.  Food was fresh, good portions, nice presentation, from the time we ordered until our food arrived was unbelievably fast, food was tasty.  Server was attentive and checked in frequently, support staff picked up empty plates without asking or getting in the way.  Overall a highly enjoyable experience, highly recommend.< /Review>

Fab cute little restaurant minutes away from the beach at Caramel. Cozy outside sitting with heating lamps at twilight adds a lot of romance and warmth, no matter the occasion ( not to mention a dog friendly place). The menu is more than satisfying with a rich assortment of Italian, Thai and Mediterranean options. I am going again (worth the 2 hours drive from Mountain View).</text>

After having read such great reviews online about the Treehouse Café we decided to try it for dinner. Unfortunately, we left very unsatisfied.
We ordered the bolognese pasta and the sauce tasted undone and like the sofrito base didn’t cook down enough. The special was a creamy tomato seafood pasta and it lacked flavor. We’re not too big on adding a ton of salt to food but the sauce needed it. We also ordered the cheese burger medium rare and it was brought to the table well done.
I will say that the wine pour was generous and good and the ambience was quaint and cute. However, the food did not meet our expectations. We’ve had our share of pastas in Italy and nonna’s cooking but this did not taste authentic. In fact, it stung when we received the bill and saw how much we were charged.
Being that Carmel attracts many tourists year round I hope that the Treehouse Café makes some improvements to the food.< /Review>

The food at Treehouse Cafe was very delicious. I ordered the Gyros for lunch and it was excellent, the beef was moist and not dry. It was too bad I didn't have room for the Greek burgers my companions ordered as well because they looked very very good and I wanted some too. The wait staff were very friendly and polite and very accommodating for our water requests on a hot day. I loved the decor and ambiance in the restaurant too. There was a queue for the single bathroom but that was no biggie the food and service were great!< /review>

The food is amazing here. The host, waiters, bussers and cooks all worked amazing together last night as a team. The restaurant was so busy and the wait was long. I highly recommend making reservations in advance... Just don't be too upset when your reservation becomes delayed because a large group doesn't want to finish their wine. I got to give it to this restaurant last night. I made reservations for 8 pm last night.. we probably were seated around 8:30pm maybe later it was definitely crowded. The staff all were wearing masks perfectly like you would hope. Tables are spaced apart. Only con is they only have one restroom... But what can you do.

I had the calamari for an appetizer and yellow curry for dinner. My spouse has the Greek burger with salad. Both were mouth watering. I don't normally like calamari but it was a steak and cooked to perfection.
This place has a wonderful romantic atmosphere and is dog and family friendly. If you are willing to wait for a seat on the deck I think it is worth it.
Thank you staff for our best night in Carmel. A great way to end a small vacation post covid.<//review>

Had a great quiet meal in a quaint restaurant. We had lamb kebabs with saffron rice and a prawn pasta dish in a garlic cream sauce. Scrumptious bread. Eclectic menu . Great service. No wait and meal came within like 15 minutes.< /Text>

It’s our go-to place to eat when we are in the area. We usually have our dogs & kids, and we love how welcoming they are every time!! The food is fantastic and the price is reasonable. Pleasant Ambience indoor & on the deck. Always super friendly and customer-service oriented.<//review>

The ambience and setting is amazing. I called for the fish ($27) which was undercooked and tasted off. I called for extra sauce twice, it never came. The bread served with the roasted garlic does not pair well at all. The staff is friendly but no one came to check how the meal was. Other stuff we ordered was decent.</Review>

<text>Treehouse was across the street from hotel so we decided to try it out. Food and service were great! Menu is eclectic with leaning to Mediterranean. Wife had lamb kabobs, I had Paella. Lamb was extremely tender and was delicious! Pasole was fantastic! Clams and mussels were tender, chicken melt in your mouth and just enough sausage to give it some spice and flavor. We both had wine which was a large pour for the price. Will definitely go back!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The lamb kebab was yummy! Perfectly cooked. The ravioli sauce was great but you couldn't really find much crab in the ravioli itself. My husband still finished all of it.</review>

If you take anything away from this review please remember that the food was awesome and we will be back! We enjoyed our gyro salad, platter, and lamb kabobs tremendously! The reason my review slipped from 4 to 3 stars were some logistical issues we had with our experience. First the bathroom situation is a bit limited with only one toilet for the entire restaurant and it was a bit messy and without paper towels. Second there seemed to be a lack of silver ware as we were provided set ups in waves, so first forks, then knives and napkins. Can’t wait to check back with Tree House once these two things are resolved!< /text>

Excellent food;  very nice and friendly staff; and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  We had the gyro platter, the chicken kabob platter, the hummus and the bruschetta. I honestly can't say which dish was best, because they were all so good! The restaurant itself is fun and the music they play is so welcome. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin. ..oldies galore! Definitely go if you visit Carmel.<//Text>

Great Mediterranean food with outstanding service! We sat outside on the 2nd story patio & loved the atmosphere! The gyros are really good & my husband said the pork sausage appetizer is the best sausage he's ever had! We went to lunch at 11:15 & had no problem getting a table. They are kid friendly (and dog friendly too!). We'd go back!<//text>

<Review>We were looking for a nice, quiet place to have a date night. This place was perfect for my husband and I to get some quality time without the kids. We went on a Friday evening in early April and almost had the place to ourselves. Ambiance was romantic and relaxing and the wine and food we're wonderful. We will definitely be back. Service was top notch too.<//Review>< pictures>

The place is amasing, amasing food and atmosphere but carmel.expansive, not one $ price mark.like it is said on google.maps.and yelp, between $$$ and $$$$ main courses start from.20$ to 35$ burgers from 15 to 18 salads from 12 to 22, firsts fro 6 to 17

Great music design.and.people

<Review>Stumbled across this place while strolling through Carmel. I was a little hesitant given the diverse menu, but what a great find. Staff were not just friendly but entertaining. I had the Green Curry with Chicken and would dare say most Thai restaurants could not achieve it’s fine taste. My wife had the Chicken Kabobs and was cooked to perfection and had a freshness to the meat and salad. Wonderful setting out on the patio overlooking the street with heat lamps adding to quite a cozy atmosphere.<//Review>< Pics>

Love this place. The food is wonderful and so are the staff. They really should have a lunch menu instead of same prices for lunch and dinner. 15 for a tuna sandwich just doesn't seem right. Prices are great for evening but a little too much for a quick bite!  Overall great ambiance and people and food</review>

<review>We stopped at this beautiful town and found this restaurant. The rooftop plays Mediterranean music with a cozy environment. We ordered the Greek Burgers that come with a salad. Both were great! The burger was on point and super tasty. The grilled onions was amazing. The stuff was super friendly as well. Highly recommend.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My Sister & family visited...we had a beautiful sunny patio lunch for 4.
Calamari appetizer
The Greek burger w carmelized onion..the best w Greek side salad.
Topped off w a Lime pie & Chocolate cake for the table ..delicious.
My niece was impressed that the waiter didn't write anything down.
We all laughed & talked how professional customer service they have in Carmel by the Sea.  Very top notched food experience.
Tremendous wine selection...
Owner & manager checked in w us ..made us feel very special.</Review>

<Text>I rarely say a restaurant is perfect but I’m sayin it now! First of all we were super late for our Sat night reservation and they just giggled and seated us immediately- even giving us a choice of tables. The waiters are so friendly and warm and appropriately attentive and so flippin’ handsome (not that that matters). Oh yes, the food...we are vegetarians so had the Caesar salad- delish, lentil soup- the perfect blend of flavors and the veggie pasta with an incredible sauce to slide the soft yet crunchy cooked to perfection bread in. To seal the deal we had key lime pie for dessert and I know my KLPs and it was excellent. I wish I lived here so I could eat her all the time. Thanks for a delightful dining experience and comfy ambience.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005</gmap_id></record>

<review>We sat at the outside patio. It was nice weather, but noticed they do have heaters when needed. We had the Salmon dish, Sea Bass, Beef Stroganoff, Yellow Curry and the Ribeye special. All were delicious. Fyi, the curry was considered more spicy (than mild as stated by menu) by someone who loves spicy hot foods, so it was fine. This place is a local favorite of 2 people in our group. Was the first time for the others, but all agreed we would come back.< /review>< user_name>

Food here was good, and service was excellent. We came in for a quick bite before we left on a long drive back home. We sat outside, which was very pleasant. They didn't have a kids menu, but made a small plate for my baby from one of the menu items. Nice experience overall.< /Review>

One of the Hidden Gems of Carmel by the Sea, superb service amd ambient atmosphere. Ordered Lamb Kebab and Gyro Sandwich for 2 of us. Lamb meat was delicious without any extra fat and tasted awesome. Greek Salad was fresh and held to the flavor.
Certainly will havr to come back and try other great looking delicacies.
Keep up the good work.< /Text>

Favorite restaurant in Carmel these days. Especially when dining with our dog Winston, who the staff remembers from year to year.  Great food, personalized service.  They make a great olive oil-parmesan cheese dip for bread.  Probably the best outdoor seating in Carmel.< /text>

<text>I was expecting at least a solid 3 in dining experience, based on the overall 4.6 rating (restaurant ratings in and around Monterey seem to be artificially inflated, for some reason).

The servers were friendly, but did forget to put our appetizer order in. We got the chicken pesto pasta and the beef stroganoff. Both dishes were severely lacking in meat portions, so we ended up paying about $22 - $24 for a bowl of noodles. The meals were relatively bland and tasteless. I think this restaurant uses its location, rather than food quality, to attract customers.

The chicken pesto pasta was greasy and oily for some reason. The chicken was not great.

The beef stroganoff was the saddest thing we received. There were 5 tiny pieces of beef in a huge bowl of noodles. They advertised mushrooms in this recipe, but we found no mushrooms in the bowl. They advertise this as Russian beef stroganoff. What they neglect to mention is this is the wartime rationed meat version of Russian beef stroganoff.

Overall, we were extremely disappointed and will not be back. I don't know what's up with the 5 star reviews, but we certainly did not have a great experience. I believe just about any restaurant in the Barnyard shopping center is superior, so I recommend you go there instead.</text>< pictures>

Pretty place for sure, but without being treated right, it's hard to appreciate it.

We were seated by an uncomfortable corner of the patio right next to where the waiters constantly walk past. That was okay, since we could've chosen to change. Once our waiter appeared, he asks us 3 questions stereotyping us, mechanically and unthinkingly. After his "revealing questions", it is soon exposed within seconds of being seated that we are vegetarians. Again, too soon and too mechanically, he gives us 3 quick options that are the only ones available to us and to let him know. Waiter quickly exits the scene.

We wonder for a few minutes on what that was and decide that this is not the experience we want to give our money for. And thus we make our exit too.<//text>

Average for the area but the area is very very good.

Atmosphere- 4 stars. Even though the rooftop deck in on the street, traffic sounds were low and trees in the area aw well as the building itself create a relaxing atmosphere. Dog friendly even though you have to walk through he restaurant to get to the deck.

Food. 3.5 stars.   The food was good.  We had Chicken Pesto Pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the chicken was tender.  The pesto cream sauce was rich but not oily.    They let us split the plate which was about perfect for lunch.

Service: 0 stars.  Servers were attentive and kind but I had an issue with my glass of wine.  I had an expensive glass of nice wine which I was nursing through dinner and had only had a couple of sips.

Near the end of dinner, a gust of wind flipped the table cloth up spilling my mostly full glass of wine.  I got a servers attention and told him what had happened and asked for some new napkins since ours were drenched in wine.  They  mopped up the wine with  the napkins but left a damp table and    didn't come back with new napkins.  They also didn't offer to comp or top off my glass.  That was a major fail.</text>

<text>Great menu and lovely outdoor seating on a second level patio surrounded by trees. The lamb shank curry was perfection! A family member had suggested a visit to Carmel when we were visiting the Monteray Bay Aquarium, and everything closer to the aquarium seemed more touristy and overpriced for the quality. I am SO glad we found this little gem a short drive south. I might visit the area again solely for another meal at the Treehouse Cafe!</text>< gmapID>

This is our favorite place in Carmel and we always come visit. It has Italian, Thai, and Greek options (I know right?) And it does all of them amazingly! You can't go wrong with any dish here. The wine glasses also have generous pours hehe< /Review>

<Review>Totally exceeded all of my expectations. The owner is very friendly and personable and they have the best wait staff I've ever seen in a restaurant. We got there on Saturday night without a reservation and a party of 6. We were told 10 minute wait but when it took a little longer they opened up the private wine room in the back for us. Alberto was our waiter and he was fantastic. He went above and beyond. We will most definitely be coming back every time we're in town.< /Review><GmapID>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005</GmapID><time>1437289551712</time>< user>

Beautiful candle and snifters, ornaments, and other beautiful things for yourself or to give as gifts. They are connected to Sock Shop with many differant socks for the whole family, many differant materials like wool, cotton, and synthetic mixes, many styles and fun socks.  They also have a few special slippers for all, one pair softer than a bunny and very comfortable, baby socks for Christmas, running socks and fancy support socks.< /review>

<review>Great food, hats off to chef.

We got a feeling that the waiter was rude, most probably because we ordered fewer foods than usual.

But the food is so awesome I didn't want to give them four.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005< /Gmap_id></record>

The food was mediocre. I ordered Thai Chicken Curry and send it back b/c it was overly sweet and overly spicy with a huge chunks of veggies. They did not charged us for that but later the charge showed up. The lamb chops were too thin to turn out medium rare and not so good. Mashed potatoes looked gray and starchy, Chicken Pesto Pasta was greasy in a pool of olive oil. Baklava was like from the store pastry dough. Service was excellent though and the ambience. Wish we never have gone there. :(< /review>

Lovely little restaurant in Carmel. If you love a British kebab then the Pita sandwich is pretty close. Otherwise, everything is top notch, gyros, lasagne, stroganoff, pasta etc.< /review>

I first visited Treehouse Cafe because they were dog friendly. I return time and again for the unbelievable service. The staff treats you as family, is always happy to see you, and will do everything to make sure you have a great meal and a great time. Oh, and the food's good, too. Whether it's ribeye, paella, dolmas, or chocolate cake, I've always been happy.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Very confusing restaurant. My family came as a party to eat up by the balcony and it was chaotic. Smoked salmon was raw without a description in the menus,meat wasn’t cooked, and servers weren’t helping and taking way to long to help, and way to pricey for something that shouldn’t be. And their paying system is too confusing and over exaggerated. I do not refer this place to you.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) Location is very nice, good service, good food. Too expensive, like everything else in Carmel. We were there at noon, it was very busy, but the staff had everything under control. Highly recommended, even if it was not quite enough for me with five stars.

(Original)
Location ist sehr nett, guter Service, gutes Essen. Bisschen zu teuer, wie alles in Carmel. Wir waren mittags dort, es war sehr trubelig, das Personal hatte aber alles gut im Griff. Durchaus zu empfehlen, auch wenn es bei mir nicht ganz für fünf Sterne reichte.</review>< response>
