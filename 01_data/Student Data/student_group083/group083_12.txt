Exceptional customer service from helpful employee Erika! She was patient while allowing us to figure which font would stand out and contrast best on translucent invitations. Beyond what was asked for, she even made professional recommendations that we did not take into account, helping the final outcome of the format look much more fitted and proportioned! From printing packing photo services and invitations whether it be a wedding birthday or formal event highly recommend Consulting first with a FedEx employee because they were not only able to save us money but time & headache! Very grateful for the staff at FedEx!</text>

This is the place where whatever needs to get done it’s done with first class service and ease , it was a Sunday and I was greeted as I stood in line and I would be helped immediately right after  she was finished helping the customer in front of me , that was truly made few minutes feel like a few seconds , great eye contact and a meaningful smile of thoughtfulness  I had called prior to going and spoke to Anna over the phone , she came straight to me and said how may I help you and her expertise, professionalism, and service was by far done with simplicity and grace. She informed me of all different types of services they provided , with confidence that they were here to make sure whatever it is I need to have shipped , printed , wrapped , copied , all under one roof , and we can do all of that today , I was stressed out all day and it was all lifted off my shoulders , she opened me a shipping account . She explained my different options  with clarity and confidence for exactly what I needed to have done , educating me , So I can make the right decision the first time , I can’t thank her enough for her time and experience of doing what she does is never the less I can’t give her 6 stars but 5 is not enough , she is above and beyond a experience like no other !!<//Text>

Really disappointed today with Fed Ex Kinko’s pricing. In September, I had them spiral bind a book for me so it would lay flat. I needed that as I have an issue with pain in my hand. The cost was around $9.00. It was a little high in price , but I paid it.

Today, I went back to spiral bind another book. It is 60 pages thinner (120), but the same size, otherwise. The price was over $13.00. Really, $4.00 more in FIVE MONTHS? So disappointed. I had hoped to recommend spiral binding to forty others who are also studying this book. Not a chance now.  Does anyone else in Ventura spiral bind books? Hoping so....</text>

Love this place.. They are open 24/7 to print, copy, work, etc... also desktop pc's for customers to use around the clock.. They also have work stations with scissors, cutting boards, glue, rulers, white out, pens, staplers, and paper clips available for your project at no extra cost.  The employees are friendly and helpful when asked.  They have great clearance items around the store.  The store is organized and clean, the restrooms are also clean.  They have everything needed for shipping... this is a great place for night owls like myself...

Add on:
Thanks Orlando and Sean for your help shipping a very large package tonight.. Again FedEx has great helpful Employees and I needed help with this package.</Review>

<Review>The New photo printing computers they have are Soooo Slow! The first one I was using for about a half hour then froze. I started all over on another computer and it took forever to crop 1 photo. You touch the screen and it takes about 30 seconds to move the photo a tiny bit. It was the most frustrating experience. It took me almost an hour and a half to print 2 photos! And the quality wasn't even that great. Never again will I go there!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The experience. I walk in start attempting to print a document on one of the automated machines. The machine hangs. I walk over to another one and it says my session needs to be complete on the one hanged.
Now, I look for help. A guy walks across me and says he's on a break and he'll ask someone to help me. So he walks into the break room and doesn't inform anyone. I wait for him for 5 minutes. Then stand in line. When my turn comes the girl closes the counter without ANY INDICATION and walks away! I give her the stink eye and ask her for help. She asks another person and he comes over in 10 mins.
He tells me that he has asked for a transfer since this store really sucks.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Ordered a package and after receiving a confirmation that the package had arrived,  called twenty minutes later to inform them it hadn't.

After being told they would call back,  which took four hours,  the rep asked if there was anyway the driver would've been able to recognize the address.  Ummm,  yes how about the door number!!

Instead of telling the driver to double back and make sure he delivered it to the right address they told us it would take 2 business days for them to follow up again.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80e852aaf39e311b:0xb8705a0f4eeb753e< /gmap_id><rating>1</rating><user_name>R.

Had to struggle to get and keep the attention of any staff. Seemed to be actively ignoring customers. I. Finally found the boxes I wanted. 10 minutes later still had not checked out and couldn't figure out why. No one in line. Staff just looked in other direction. Horrible service< /review>

Disappointed - I wanted to have 10 pages scanned to sent to my email as a PDF.  Service representative said we don't do that - - you can use the design computers and figure it out yourself.  I went to Office Max, and they completed it for 50 Cents, and I was finished in 3 min< /Text>

Terrible service!!!!! I had to find a place close by to print a PDF document. I got there, just to find that not a single printer was working, Ann's the "staff" was rude and very unhelpful. After nearly one hour there, and having my card charged almost $10, I was able to print the two pages I needed. Had I known what a horrible experience I would have, I would have gone home instead and printed out there.
Stay away at all costs!!!< /review>

Just left this place. Probably the biggest waste of printing equipment in the world. If they actually knew how to use it they would probably make a lot of money but Instead they have untrained idiots on staff. Took 3 people and they still couldn't handle a simple enlargement of a blue print. Permanently lost business from me!< /text>

Just like others have stated - refuse perfectly good packages and attempt to up sell packaging services - please call 800 go fedex and report this location through customer service for their fraudulent business practices.

Also as others have stated - the worst possible customer.</Review>

<Text>Please save yourself $$$ and take your shipping elsewhere.  This Fedex location has the worst business practices I've encountered in my 10 years of shipping 1,000's of products a year.  The employees here hum and haw about the condition of your box, the condition of your packaging, the inner packaging and declare its not up to their standards.  Its no surprise they can repack or sell you additional supplies for X more dollars.

There are plenty of honest shipping centers in Ventura.  The Ventura Business Center is on Telegraph, if possible ship there and save yourself money and heartache.

If its not clear already, I hate this store with a passion.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80e852aaf39e311b:0xb8705a0f4eeb753e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Please pack and ship your items somewhere else, save yourself time and money, this is by far the worst fedex location I've ever worked with.  Support a local company like Ventura Business Center, where they dont nit pick your packages, looking for any reason to "sell" you additional packing materials or supplies because your box or pack job does not meet their standards.</review>

My wife and I love this place. The neighborhood is a great area to live and raise your children. Since we’ve lived here— only a few months now— Jane Lanning, of the front office has been superb, and a blessing. She went out of her way to find a unit suitable for my wife and I.

If there’s one downside I’d have to say, it would be all of the maintenance issues we’ve had the short time living here. But even then, Jane and the maintenance team have been on top of their game.< /Text>

Living here for almost a year already we moved in the middle on the pandemic, loved how simple and easy it was! Everyone at the office are so kind and friendly to answer all kinds of questions! Love Jane so much, was so helpful when we moved in and when we were in search of a new location. 😁< /text>

<review>My family and I recently moved in here, and so far we love it. The move-in process was swift, easy and simple as everything was conveniently done online. Jane, the assistant manager, was very kind and made us feel good about our new home in a new city! We have moved A LOT, and thanks to Jane this experience has by far been the best.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1621384446984, 'text': "Hi Alejandra, thanks for recognizing Canyon Villa Apartment Homes and giving one of our awesome teammates a shout-out!

I just signed my third lease here. As a single mom it’s not easy to find a community where I can feel safe and comfortable. This complex is well kept, the staff is lovely and always helpful and try to come up with activities every month. We haven’t had any issues in the last 2.5 years. I highly recommend it!< /Text>

Darya is really nice and helpful. I do recommend asking for her if you’re planning to move in.
But there are some things about the apartments that we don’t like.
The apartments do need more maintenance and are on the old side. I highly recommend taking a lot of pictures of the apartment and inspect the inside before moving all your stuff.
Something that people don’t talk about is the Internet, they still use DSL that’s how old these apartments are so the most you can get is 25MB and they only work with AT&T.  The parking is a HUGE problem, besides not been enough people don’t respect, once you move in they gave you a sticker so you can park inside but other people with no sticker park here and not just that people park everywhere, red zone, handicap zone and on the curb. When I get home from work is really annoying  to find NO parking but seen all these cars with no sticker taking all the spaces.<//text>

We are goin on our 2nd year living here. Despite of a crazy pregnancy with COVID, and not being able to work/ & family catching covid twice we had a horrible first year financially and Canyon Villa was able to help us through those months, and we totally appreciate it. Ever since we moved in Jane has always been sooo sooo  sweet, professional and knowledgeable with the availability of either the  parking or units. She is always informative about upcoming contests and she will even call to remind me of these cute contests they put together. :-)( Wow! who has prop management that does this !?) Parking isn't as bad now that we actually pay for a parking spot on the property. This past year we donated to Voices for Children and even won a whole huge TURKEY. It's really the little things like this that keep us wanting to stay here. The only complaint I have is that the internet isn't the best here. They say its the best network and nooo noo its not at all true..  I was not able to work remotely without internet always cutting out. I had to go a week without working try to figure out the issues. When we have new residents move in our little area once they get internet someone's is bound to shut off and we have to always call AT&T to fix it. Hoping they allow another company to come in for cable/internet to refrain from this happening
. Other than that great place to live. :)

Thanks Jane for making this a pleasant place to live.< /Text>

<Text>If I could give this place negative stars I definitely would! This is by far the WORST place I have EVER lived. They’re CROOKS. They have a bad case of mold. And if you report the mold they bring in someone to cut the mold out THEN bring in someone a few days later to “Test” for mold. So they can put in their reports no evidence of mold. They inconvenience you then still expect you to pay your rent in full. They’re very unprofessional when speaking to you whether it’s on the phone or in an email. If you prove they owe you money they want you to sign a non disclosure saying you can’t write a review about your experience living in the apartments. I definitely wouldn’t recommend these apartments to anyone. They need better management and staff, and really need to FIX they’re apartments so they’re livable because they’re not worth what they’re charging.<//Text>< rating>

<text>I normally do not post negative reviews. But DO NOT rent here. I lived here for 2 years. In two different apartments. Just like everyone else, I loved the layout and the look of the apartments, I originally moved into a 2/2 with the gray scheme. We loved it until we moved out and they charged us $1300 for cleaning and repairs?!!? I had gone out of my way to repaint the walls, clean the apartment and clean the carpet before move-out. When I moved out they charged me $700 because they had to repaint ALL the walls, apart from carpet and cleaning costs?!?

By the time I got the bill I had already downgraded into a 2 bedroom 1 bath (brown scheme) because of financial issues. As soon as we got the 2/1, we noticed the walls were painted two different colors, the carpet was stained, and the floors had blotches of paint on them. (Not to mention the cockroaches)

Now we’re ready to move out of here, our renters insurance was expiring on the 8th, take mind, and our lease ended on the ELEVENTH. I didn’t see a reason as to why I should renew my renters insurance if we would be moving in 3 days, and they charged my family $50 DOLLARS for those three days!! And then claimed that I would be charged those $50 monthly, for an apartment I won’t be living in anymore! Why in the world would they do this?! We’re in hard times, where people are loosing their jobs, and I’ve been seeing other residents complaining and moving out because Canyon Villa showed no remorse towards their hardship. And honestly... I see it too now. Please, do not move here if you would like to save your money.< /text></record>

The leasing staff professional and tends to get things done efficiently and in a time sensitive manner. As with most things it doesn't come perfect-parking is a mess, I have witnessed and have been towed away without warning. The community gives residents 2 stickers that go on vehicles. The challenge with that is the stickers are not reusable. So multiple visitors will be a challenge. There isn't much street parking especially the afternoon. The maintenance staff is excellent-Mr. Frank is one of the friendliest individuals you will meet. As a whole Canyon Villa Apartment Homes are affordable, decent living and in short distances to food, entertainment and more.< /Text>

<name>Tyler's Playtime< /name><Date>1572220272665<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>We relocated to these apartments from across the country so we never got to see them before we got there.  They were nice apartments and the office staff were friendly.  And that was all that was nice.  Absolutely no parking ever.  Small lot with free spaces but if you get there after 2pm (I work til 4) you park on street because no spaces left.  This railroads you into spending money for the carports or garage.  The garages are so tiny that my SUV would NEVER fit comfortably! So we paid for a carport across the complex due to too many nights walking from the street.  Maintenance takes FOREVER!!! The staff is friendly enough but you wait WEEEKS for anything.  They say they will call and that only happens half of the time. The pool is nice but gets over crowded with people throwing parties EVERY WEEKEND.  This means public grills are blocked and there is always loud music.  We had people drop trash at our door, throw our stuff on the ground and when I called office all I got was well you shouldn’t leave your stuff hanging outside.  We had a rack for our towels for crying out loud cuz the balcony/patio had NO SPACE! Also someone stole my bathing suit....GROSS!!!!!!!!!! Kids run around and voice balls off the walls.  This means dogs go crazy.  There were people fighting at all hours of the night all the time. It was the worst experience we have ever lived.  We left after a couple months and broke our lease it was so bad.  No security or office hours on sundays so people don’t follow rules.  Parking stickers mean nothing.  It’s managed so poorly it’s not worth the $$$$< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
I moved in about 2 weeks ago and my experience has been great. I read some of the reviews myself and I'm glad I made my own decision. My apartment is great and for the price with a washer and dryer I can't complain. I see a lot of changes happening everyday including the landscaping and I can't wait to see the complete outcome. I was moving from the east coast and Paige was the 1st person I spoke to over the phone and was very helpful. She put my mind at ease and moving in was a breeze. My neighbors are great and it's been very quiet. Maintenence has been timely when I needed assistance figuring something out but I've had no problems with anything being broken or not working.  The only thing I would recommend about moving here is making sure you purchase a garage or a carport.</review>

It has had 3 owners in the past 4 years.  I was given a carport due to me being handicapped, second owner/mgmt took that away.  They started to upgrade the units,  they have changed the common areas a couple of times.  They raised our rent 3 time's as well.  Our unit was very dated we did like it, however they wanted to raise our rent again.  We gave our 30 day written notice, and packed our belongings and cleaned the apartment.  The apartment was cleaner then when we got it, we got a carpet cleaner and cleaned the carpets, patched nail holes and touched up the paint as well as cleaned.  We knew that the unit was going to be upgraded, New floors, new carpet, new cabinets and new blinds.  I believe that they would have been fine with the unit.  We received a notice that they want us to pay for paint, new blinds, and carpet.  I do not know how old the carpet was when we moved in,  it was not new.

Worst customer service you will ever receive in your life. The office blatantly ignores any maintenance request.

< review>
I been at Canyon Villa for over three years. After reading alot of the complaints I can understand the loud music horns honking etc: Just a reminder this is an apartment complex with close proximety to other neighbors so yes you are going to hear other people alot more than lets say a housing complex. The only thing I can complain about is the parking other than that it's been a pretty good experiance here. I never had a problem with the Maintenance and I realize i am not the only resident here with complaints and neither or you!!.<//review>

The people in the office only care about taking your money every month and don't give any thought to the issues you are having while living here. The office staff is lacking professionalism and are extremely rude when you have just a simple question or concern.  I have been a great tenant and ALWAYS pay rent early and this is how they treat me. I have never been one to complain online but this just needed to be herd. This is just the tip of the ice burg and I'm not going to go into detail with the rest as there is much much more. I just warn you to use caution when thinking about moving into this place. They will say or do what's needed to sale you on the place. PLEASE message me if you have any questions or want my honest opinion. I will gladly give you my phone number< /text><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Management at this place consists of bad people and liars. This place has changed the management 3 times while I had a lease over there. First management promised me a storage until my lease starts to store my stuff that I moved from Chicago, IL. They lied to me and didn't end up giving me any storage. I had to keep a Uhaul truck for additional week and pay for it. Then they said they will pay me back for the extended time of having the truck. They never did.
I had no problems with second management besides maintenance, it always took them too long to come and fix things that already didn't work.
Third management however was the worst. They started doing remodeling of all apartments around ours making so much noice. They were replacing the old looks and upgrading some amenities, adding granite kitchen counters, etc. When our lease ended we left and expected to receive a portion of our $1200 security deposit back. For couple of months we didn't receive nothing even tho I left the new address on the form for the security deposit. I ended up calling them just to find out that we now owe them $1800 more. They basically charged us $3000 for new paint job for walls and a carpet that my wife has been maintaining and left cleaner than what it ever was. Today my wife, friend who lived with us and I have a collection on our credit scores for $1900 that we will never pay but will do a lawsuit to get it removed. They can't do a remodeling and charge residents for it, saying it was a carpet (which was clean and looked better than it was looking when we moved in). And even if it was it couldn't cost that much even if it was made of golden fibers...

Please don't tell me to contact management because I did contact the corporate office and they were as equally unprofessional as their employees at the residence. They never even sent me the receipt, they just claimed that their employees were right... MG Properties has the worst customer service and protection. The entire point of giving deposit up front is to cover any potential damages created while using your property. Charging even more than that after we left and for nothing we did is just a ripoff and very unprofessional. That's why all the reviews over here are the way they are, negative...< /Review>

People here are inconsiderate  and nasty. Loud music at night and constant horn honking throughout the day and night. Maintenance sucks, I moved in and first day I noticed a broken knob on my washer and put in numerous requests and was not fixed and my bedroom door knob was just falling off. When I tried to get ahold of the office I waited 30 minutes past their lunchtime on their window. Just poor service and not a good experience. Don't move here.</Text>

<text>This is literally the worst place I've ever dealt with while in the military. Don't live here!!! So many rules and parking sucks. Why should a resident who is already paying so much in rent have to pay extra for a parking spot or garage? To all my military brothers and sisters find housing elsewhere! Wouldn't even let me fly  my American flag!< /text>< Pictures>

I moved from this place with my husband less than a year ago. The Management here was very rude, literally every agent was very rude and impolite. When i lived there, it was 2 female agents working there by the names of Stephanie and Michelle and honestly, i don't know who is worse between them. The entire time of living there was a complete disaster. We had to wait days before a Maintence man would come to repair a light or something that was already not working. They accused us of leaving the carpet dirty with stains, and used that as an excuse to hold our security deposit. Also, they sent us a bill after we moved out stating that they kept the deposit due to the damage. Which is all a lie because we have no kids or pets at all and i am a housewife. I always cleaned the house on a daily basis. Vaccumn and wash walls. Etc. I seriously don't understand why all of this has happened, they reported my information to the credit bereau and now my credit score is completely low. These people are complete rip offs. I seriously recommend not living here.</text>

Over-priced. Terrible policies regarding reserved parking and garages. Unable to use BigBox or PODS even if it's in a space you are paying for.

Say goodbye to choosing your own ISP and Cable, due to some almost shady deal/situation, AT&T is the only authorized service provider allowed on the grounds.<//Review>

Don't let the remodeled signs outside fool you. Ive lived hete 11 months and had issues with a broken heater, broken air conditioner, and broken washer before I even moved In and each took 1-2 months to fix. I had an electrical issue then water leak and everything is so slow with the maintenance and poor customer service from the new manager of the month- Monei. The management has changed 3 times in less than a year and nothing is consistent. This is the worst place I've ever lived and in surprised there hasn't been a lawsuit. Oh and the elevators have been down 3 months and the jacuzzi was broken and dirty all summer. The excuse from the manager is that the elevators are expensive to fix. $50k each. If youre thinking of living here, run away. There's better places and once my lease is up in out of here too.< /Text>

It looks nice...but its all a gimmick. Husband (active military) was told we are getting a remodeled apartment, a pet free and smoke free unit with new blinds, new appliances. We moved in Oct, and the first thing that hits you in the face is the stench of dog/cat urine. The wood floors would make your feet black. The microwave was broken, fridge shelves were broken. THANK GOODNESS I got the carpet replaced after headbutting the office. One of the bedroom windows leaks water when rains. The maintenance is terrible takes forever to get something done. Kitchen light went out on a Thursday evening, went to office before closed told maintenance wasn't on scene (THEY LIVE IN THE COMPLEX) and did not get fixed till the next week after going to office monday and tuesday. WINDOW still isnt fixed (went to office in NOVEMBER) ....Parking is terrible i pay 1625 for rent 120 for utilities (its just 2 adults and 1 baby) and then 50$ for parking, because I dont feel like walking a mile to my apartment from my car parked on the street with a baby. Most definitely getting screwed over here.

I Can keep going on and on and on. Location is great though.but the management here is terrible neighbors are rude. traffic noises well are annoying.

OH AND WHEN ASKED TO VIEW AN APARTMENT they will not let you see an empty unit only model ones and will ask you not to take pictures.<//text>

This is truly my second home and everyone in this academy are my second family. Never a bad day after I roll on the mats of Gracie Barra Upland. It provides classes for all level and all types of physical activities levels. Whether you're looking for self- defense, better physical endurance, healthier lifestyle, competitions, or just staying active this is the place you have to try at least once and most likely, it won't be your only visit. Great world champions professors and coaches. High caliber competitors and always providing training with the best jiujitsu practitioners. Family like atmosphere and involved with the community. Please do yourself a favor, try it at least once and you will be hooked. I love this place with a passion</Text>

<Text>I’ve been to 18 states in 6.5 months. I trained at multiple locations all over the United States. Gracie Barra Upland California is by far the best place I’ve trained at. This place here I call home, I made friends who turned into family. The atmosphere here is very welcoming as soon as you walk in. The professors and coaches here are on it. When your learning the steps to become someone who need to be. They show you step by step until moves become muscle memory. I started 2 years ago in my journey in Brazilian jujitsu. Since then I lost 40-45 pounds and feel great better than ever before. I give it all to GBU for changing my life, and saving me. Thank you professors and coaches.< /Text>< userid>

My home away from home! I know Professors before since they first arrived in the USA. Professor Ana have always been a huge inspiration to me of determination, willpower and strength.... I was amazed to see a female achieve the titles she had achieved in such a young age. They are the true role models you want to have around your kids. I send my now 15 year old daughter for jiu jitsu camps at GB Upland at least once a year so she can be around such a positive leader within our community! If you live in the area, don’t hesitate to go check it out, it will be life changing !<//text>

Gracie Barra Upland is the best Jiu jitsu academy out there, the training here never disappoints and it is an amazing investment. Regardless of your experience level the Professors and Coaches do an astounding job at progressing everyone through the ranks, and they are always there for their students. Whether it be needing help with handling an injury, dealing with nerves for a competition or just simple questions, they always know exactly what to say. I highly recommended training at Gracie Barra Upland, it is a friendly-family oriented environment, welcomes all ages with open arms, and is a highly clean-organized facility. There are so many positive influences here, and it will easily become home for anyone who walks through their doors.<//Text>

<Review>I have been training for over 15 years.  Gracie Barra Upland is one of the premier Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academies in California.  There is something for everyone.  They have many levels of classes for kids, adults and competitors.  Prof Ana and Prof Rafael are great teachers.  They care about their students and their progress.  Come by and try a free class.  You will never leave.<//Review>< pictures>

Growing up I was around many different martial arts. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was the one that I gravitated to for many reasons: the family, confidence building  and discipline it instilled in me.
Professor Ana and Rafael are extremely knowledgeable and technical teachers that care about their students and their progress.
If you're looking to start Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or need a form of physical activity this is the place to check out. With multiple classes available, they have something for everyone.</Text>

The School atmosphere  is very familiar and everyone helps each other. Teachers and coaches are trained to give attention to everyone. Children have fun while learning self Defense, discipline and build their confidence. I'm very happy to be part of this team.</Review>< Resp>

If you are looking for an academy to train BJJ in, please look no further. Prof Anna & Rafael are excellent teachers. Always smiling, friendly, helpful and very supportive. The curriculum and techniques that are taught are excellent. The atmosphere is always upbeat and positive, classes are always fun and the facilities are great. An awesome place to train jiu-jitsu. Gracie Barra Upland is Highly recommended!!!< /Text>

A very family oriented Brazilian jiu-jitsu school where people of all ages can learn and train. The world champion professors are always happy to teach with positive energy and will teach a variety of techniques. Kids or adults alike are tought both for fun or at competition level. I have trained for almost 6 years and I would recommend this school to anybody looking to train!< /Review>

<text>I've never done jiu jitsu in my life. Starting to train that kind of activity might be scary at first, but within the first 2 weeks I knew that was the right place to start. The professors and coaches are extremely patient and they will help you a lot with Brazilian jiu-jitsu. It has been 3 months since I've been going to classes and sparring rounds and it's amazing how much they've helped me to improve.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
As far as martial arts go, you really cant beat Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and as far as training with some of the best practitioners of BJJ, you cant beat Professors AnaLaura and Rafael. They are an inspiring couple who came to this country with little financial means, but pursued a dream to be the best in the world in their field. Professor Ana is a multiple-time world champion and her proficiency on the mat is matched by her dedication to the students. Not only are they champions on the mat, but in their mentality and approach to life. Every parent should want their kids to have mentors that help incubate the confidence and strength of character that is desperately needed in today's culture.

GB Upland is a family friendly environment where kids develop life-skills on the mat that will sustain them throughout life, but the Academy also offers high-level competition training where students from all over are looking to test their skills on the competition circuit.

Whether you are wanting to shed some extra pounds, develop confidence and self-discipline, train with world champions, or just love rolling on the mat and practicing the art, you will not be disappointed at GB Upland.< /Review>

I’ve been training here since I was 6 years old and now I have the privilege of being a coach. With this, I can say there is no other place I would want to be at to train, learn, or work. I love being part of this fun, positive, and healthy environment and would highly recommend it💙</text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>Unfortunately, not such a great experience with Dr. Franklin this week. We felt she didn’t give our family the proper attention, instead she rushed to give us a treatment plan without an opportunity to discuss options or questions. It was a busy day, so we could sense the urgency to move on to the next patient, which is exactly what happened. Dr Franklin gave us 5 min of her time at max. She quickly completed her evaluation with minimal parent involvement or understanding and instructed her staff to “schedule the next visit”. Definitely not what was expected from other reviews. I decided to return to the clinic to get a second opinion, with a different doctor next week. thanks to the efficient and well informed administrative staff who actually answers many of our questions. So, in sum my opinion is that if you’re looking for an empathetic and caring dentist, from my experience I say, Dr Franklin is not for you.<//review></record>

<review>I have gone take my 4year old to other locations and I didn’t like the treatment . Nor my child or me weren’t calm when came to checking up his teeth, he had so much anxiety. This is third time we come to this location, Dr. Yazdi has been absolutely amazing when comes to talking to kids and his experience. My child is not afraid to come back.

Tongue tie center: our fourth child was born with a serious tongue tie and we've never dealt with that issue before, Dr yazdi provided ample information and gave me confidence to proceed with the tongue revision, and confidence that I could deal with the aftercare. The office will give you a booklet that has all the information for aftercare that a stressed exhaustive parent will need. (You don't need to google everything as you go!) The waiting rooms for the nervous parents are designed to be a soothing as possible 😊</Review>

I have been bringing my daughter Ariel to this office for about two years now and the entire staff have been the same since day one! They are very welcoming, and professional.  Dr Franklin and her assistants have been working with my daughter and I can’t thank them enough!! I appreciate the talks they have with Ariel to make her feel comfortable (which is not an easy task). I appreciate the affirmations before and during the process and most of all I appreciate the patience!  Ariel had her first filling today which was not an easy visit (due to her fears) and about two hours after the visit we received a call from Dr Franklin, checking on my baby to see how she was doing! When I hung up Ariel says “she’s the best doctor ever.” She really is and I wouldn’t dare take my baby anywhere else! This Dentist Office is the best!

Thank you ❤️< /Text>

Wow. Where do I start...? It was an amazing experience. After learning my daughter was indeed tongue, lip tied and cheek tied, he suggested moving forward with the procedure with absolutely no pressure. Amazingly, he was able to hear my baby struggling nursing from across the room. After taking photos and explaining everything, he was back in about two minutes with my daughter in his hands and the procedure was done. It was amazing.

The most intense personal moment for me was when he heard me speaking and asked me to safely lower my mask so he could see my tongue and he immediately said, “Yes, you have a severe case of tongue tie.” He noticed my speech impediment with my “S” sound (lateral lisp) that I’ve lived with for 39 years. Just to know that this may have been the cause, or that correction was even a hope, was enough for me to feel like I was in the twilight zone. I’m in awe of his expertise.

His staff was extremely kind and safe. They are highly aware of being safe with the pandemic. I highly recommend this man and his team. We drove two hours to him cause we researched and decided he was the best idea for our family. I’m so grateful we met him and his team of professionals.< /review>

<Text>Wow, Dr. Yazdie is an angel! Our toddler has a language delay and some sensory processing issues (including strongly disliking his mouth to be touched). Dr. Yazdi has deep knowledge and experience with kids with special needs. She and her team were gentle and understanding.

Took my almost 1 year old to see Dr. Yazdi, he was so patient, professional and thorough. I especially appreciated his honesty related to all the ties he had in his mouth and how to best proceed. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<time>1611790507579< /time><Text>We have been to this dentist office twice. Both times, I was super impressed with how they handled my four year old. He wasn’t nervous with the assistants or the dentists. They are so so fantastic with kids!
Our most recent visit was for a dental emergency. The on call doc and an assistant came in on a Saturday to help my little boy and they were incredibly kind. They put him at ease, kept him distracted with the hard stuff, and were really communicative with me and him throughout the whole process. I was honestly afraid to visit a dentist in Covid times, but the extent to which they clean, I have no more fear of that.
Every surface is disinfected, I was allowed to be present and sit in a chair nearby while giving the staff distance.
Highly recommend this office for your kiddos. Bonus when they are able to re-open fully, their play area is super fun!!!<//Text>< UserId.>

As another doctor I have high expectations for other providers, and Dr. yazdi does not disappoint. He is incredibly personable and articulate. And his skills were top notch on my sons procedure. In the follow up his staff was always available and he was even willing to review updated pictures via text to monitor healing. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for someone to give advice on or perform a frenectomy.< /review>

We love love Dr. Franklin. Been sending my oldest here since she was 1.5 years and now my youngest just started seeing her too. We've had a few procedures done here....a tooth removal due to an accident, some issues with crowding and the subsequent iffy spots, and Dr. Franklin has been a dream in her ability to make my girls feel comfortable while making sure their dental needs are well taken care of.</text>

Dr. Yazdi was very informativeabout the pros of releasing my son’s tongue and lip tie. He did not pressure us at any time during the consult and stepped out so my husband and I could discuss if we wanted to proceed. We decided to proceed, we heard our son cry for a minute and then he was brought back to us swaddled and sleeping. He extensively reviewed how to perform the wound card to ensure the procedure was successful. We were given the option to come back in a week in person for evaluation or send photos. I chose to return back to the office. Dr. Yazdi stated that we had been performing the wound care well and reviewed how well our son was doing and how he had improved from prior to his procedure. If your baby needs their lip or tongue tie done, we highly recommend Dr. Yazdi.<//Review>

<Review>I highly recommend this dentist, especially for children with sensory disorders. Dr. Franklin is amazing and seems to be very knowledgeable as far as working with children like my son. He’s moderately autistic and scared of getting his teeth cleaned, yet  Dr. Franklin is very patient, gentle, kind and understanding with him. I am blessed to have found this dentist because finding a dentist willing to work with Autistic children is not easy. Also, I felt very safe taking my son there to have his teeth cleaned during Covid as they take all the necessary precautions. Five Stars!<//Review>< pics>

Expensive practice and promote too aggressive treatments.
The hygienist is less than mediocre.  Barely scraped any plague of my child, only check 1-2 teeth, and said it looks great. Spend time only brushing.  The doctor did scrape off the plague on every tooth which why I give 3 stars.
Dr. recommends too many unnecessary treatments. SDF costs $35 per tooth instead of per treatment compared to other dentists. Good for a single tooth but if you have more than 1 cavity, this gets expensive.
Staffs are not very competent. Mistakes on records and billings.< /Review>

<text>My now 6 and 8 year old have been seeing Dr. Niekia Franklin, who is amazing. I appreciate her warmth and her enthusiasm for dental health. She supports me as a parent in encouraging the kids with praise for what they are doing well and education for the boys when they need improvement. She hears my concerns and gives me options, but I really trust her judgment and experience. The hygienists are also so kind and work well with young children. Love the front desk staff - always a friendly way of coming into and departing the appointment. Thanks!<//text>< pics>

Dr. Yazdi did an amazing job with my sons lip and tongue tie revisions. He is worth the 2 hour drive we made to see him. He is gentle kind and caring. I don’t have any negative feedback whatsoever. From the very clean and lovely office to making me feel comfortable with my decision it was a flawless experience. If you are wondering if he will be the right fit or if it’s worth a long drive to be seen at his office, just do it! You will not be disappointed.< /review>

I went to see Dr Yazdi when my son was almost 9 months old. Breastfeeding had been tough since the beginning and every problem we had circle back to possible tongue-tie. The lactation consultants dismissed my concern while confirming that he may have one. After a lot of research, I found out that dr Yazdi was the pediatric dentist I should see to have my son checked. The process to make an appointment is well explained on their website, their clinic is modern, clean and welcoming. All the staff is sweet and professional and dr Yazdi is amazingly calm, professional and nice. He diagnosed my son, explained what he recommended and the aftercare to be done and the procedure lasted less than 5 minutes. I highly recommend seeing dr Yazdi and his staff<//text>

Dr Yazdi and his team were wonderful. We had my 4.5 month old son’s ties revised and chose Dr Yazdi after seeing him referred to as the best pediatric dentist in California, particularly for ties. If you are a part of any supportive tongue tie group on Facebook then you have seen his name hundreds (maybe thousands) of times with parents singing his praises! It’s all true! Dr Yazdi and his team were kind, gentle, and thorough. We are 4 days post op and the stretches are getting a bit easier. We are so grateful for Dr Yazdi and his team. Our guy was severely tied in four places. I wish I would have sought him out sooner but grateful to be on track now. If you’re on the fence and reading this, just make an appointment, I wish I would have! Also recommend going to the Walgreens near his office and picking up more arnica (they carry it), it was our first introduction to it and it really seemed to help and was harder to find in our area!<//text>

<review>As an IBCLC, I’ve had a lot of clients use Dr. Yazdi and love him, so when my own baby had issues, I knew who I wanted to use. His bed side manor is very comforting when you are in such a vulnerable stressful time. Also his office is absolutely adorable which no one else told me about, so it was a present surprise. It didn’t feel like a standard medical office. The procedure was unbelievably fast. Faster than I thought was possible and so far the results have been a breath of fresh air. My baby couldn’t transfer more than 0.5 oz at a time, so I was having to pump, finger feed with an SNS. No matter how much I burped her she was also projectile vomiting 80% of her feeds and I was having to refeed her. My life was seriously pumping, feeding, burping and washing everything getting ready to start all over again. Right now it is only 1day post op and she hasn’t spit up at all and is already transferring 1.5oz at the breast. This experience was exactly what I was hoping it would be and I would continue to recommend Dr Yazdi to anyone!!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I am very disappointed with our last appointment. I called to make an appointment for my daughter on a Friday. I let the receptionist know my daughter had chipped her tooth while biting a fork and needed it filed. She told me the office had appointments open all day on Monday. So I choose 9am. My husband took the day off work to take her in since we have 4 kids and only those with appointments are allowed in the office. Well, after being “evaluated” the Dr told my husband he’d need to bring my daughter back later that day to have it filed because they didn’t have time to do it. He asked why and was told her appointment was only an “evaluation” and they don’t perform services during “evaluations”. That would have been nice to know WHEN I BOOKED HER APPOINTMENT!! My husband said the receptionist couldn’t care less and just told him “that’s how we do things here”. I feel it’s wrong to conduct business like this. What parent has time to come back twice for a simple procedure?! Especially during Covid when you have to find childcare for your other kids. My only assumption as to why they didn’t tell me about this 2 appointment policy  is because that way they can bill insurance twice for 2 visits. Needless to say, we will be taking all 4 of our kids somewhere else for dental services.</Review>< Pics>

I have two young adults and a kindergartner who all have seen Dr. Yazdi and his colleagues. I have NEVER had a bad experience. Most recently my youngest son needed a procedure requiring a filling and nitrous. I was nervous. Dr. Franklin was outstanding with him, she is perfect for her chosen profession. I am overall so impressed with this office that I felt compelled to write this review.<//review>

<Text>Dr. Yazdi and staff were friendly and professional. Dr. Yazdi answered all of our questions in depth and we felt no pressure to make a decision. The procedure was surprisingly quick and the results were effective and immediate. At 3.5 months my daughter was still struggling to latch but within a minute of the tongue and lip ties being released I was able to nurse her and it was like night and day. I could finally hear her taking big gulps of milk and the latch was nearly pain free for myself which is something I had not experienced until that moment.

Just four days after the procedure I have already begun to notice an increase in my milk supply which was has always been struggling. I would recommend Dr. Yazdi to anyone who needs to have their child's tongue tie released. My only regret is that I did not contact him sooner.< /Text>< username>

Dr Franklin is my 6-year old daughter’s Dentist. She is kind, patient, and wonderful when it comes to caring for my daughter. She is very in tune with the likes and interests of my daughter and is able to chat (and distract) her with talk of all things Disney. She is quick and efficient and gives specific feedback to me on how we can improve the overall health of her mouth. :) We really like her a lot and would recommend her to other families.<//Review>

My family and I love this place. Everyone is super kid friendly and makes going to the dentist an easy, non -scary thing, unlike when I was growing up. My son has an extreme fear of needles and I was worried when he had to get a cavity filled but because of the way they handle everything my son didn't even know he was getting a numbing shot. They have movies on the ceiling and kids sunglasses to make the bright lights easier to take - lots of care is taken to help kids feel comfortable and happy at the dentist. Their entire staff is kind, confident and knowledgeable. Their customer service is very reliable and warm. We have been very happy with our experience every time.< /review>

Our newborn had a tongue and lip tie. We were referred to Dr Yazdi’s office and he was incredible. He made us feel confident in the procedure! When we need to take our kid to the dentist in the future, we will be choosing Dr Yazdi!< /text>

<Text>The BEST dental office in the Bay Area for children and teens!!

My now 14 and 16 year old children have been Dr. Yazdi’s patients since they were  18-months old. I’m grateful to have received that referral so long ago, and have been very pleased with the service and professionalism of the doctors and staff. They’re now Dr. Franklin’s patients and she’s very welcoming, attentive and professional.

I would recommend Dr. Yazdi for specialty needs (frenectomy), Dr. Niekia Franklin for dental wellness and Dr. Kim for Orthodontics.
You can’t go wrong with this team of doctors!!!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808f918906f7cba1:0x46b6d951c28f7de< /Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><user_name>S Braziel<//user_name><Date>1610073460328<//Date>< UserId.>

My girls and I absolutely love Dr. Franklin and her dental assistants! We have always had positive experiences at this dental office. My 1 year old doesn’t even cry and it’s her second time going. Dr. Franklin does a great job with distracting her by singing her songs. My 5 year old loves going to the dentist as well. Super sweet and friendly staff!<//review>

<Review>Shervin Yazdi was very knowledgeable, patient, and gentle with my baby. All his staff were wonderful from our first phone call through to the follow up after our appointment. It was easy to schedule a time for the following week, fill out all the forms online, and do a quick COVID-19 questionnaire through text.

Best doctor to consult in Bay Area if your baby has tongue tie and struggling to breast feed. My son had hard time first 4 weeks with breast feeding and Dr. Yazdi helped with it. My son has been exclusively breast feeding since then and I recommend this anyone with similar problem.<//review>

Honestly, Dr. YAZDI was amazing with our daughter. She was a week old when we had to go to him to correct her tongues tie, one buccal tie and upper lip tie. They thoroughly explained to us everything that was going to happen before the exam and how beneficial the procedure was to not only help her with breastfeeding but later on in life to help her with her speech. We are so grateful to have found him through our midwife and breastfeeding consultant, bc a lot of people don't know about the effect that strong ties in the mouth can have on feeding. For us it wasn't night and day like some other people, she is still too small to be able to latch well. But the entire office and team were so sweet and caring. The entire procedure took less than 2 minutes and she came back still sleeping. It's better to do anything like this while they are still very young. Dr. Yazdi himself was very educating and soft spoken and even did one of the procedures foe free cause it was necessary. Would definitely come back in the future if we need to!!< /text>

<text>Dr. Yazdi and his staff are absolutely amazing. They were so great with our whole experience. They explained the whole procedure to us in detail and made sure to answer any questions we had. Everyone was very sweet with our little guy and made sure his needs were met. We recommend Dr. Yazdi 100%</text><date>1597615545332<//date>< Resp>

<text>I’ve been to Dr. Yazdi with now two of my babies for the frenectomy procedure. I appreciate so much the service he provides as I would not have been able breastfeed my two youngest children had it not be for him. Both babies had tongue ties and were unable to latch successfully weeks after their births. This procedure allowed us to breastfeed successfully. In the last six years Dr. Yazdi has continued to research this procedure and improve his technique and the healing procedure. We are very pleased with the outcome and the new wound care method. As an added luxury he now has an office primarily for his frenectomy patients with patient rooms that are a comfortable, nursery type setting for consultation and nursing after the procedure. Lastly, they are making good effort to keep everyone safe from Covid, we felt very comfortable and appreciate their practices!<//text>< time>

<Review>Dr Yazdi explained everything so thoroughly and was so good with our little girl. At 9 months old, she’s considered an “older” patient and somewhat harder to deal with being that she’s already on the move. He and his staff were so kind and patient with her and we are so glad we made the drive to his office for her frenectomy.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I took my 2 month old with Dr. Yazdi for a frenectomy because she had a lip and tongue tie and he was very detailed about both the procedure and the after-care.
He made us well informed of everything so that we didn't leave all confused! It's a lot of info but he provides a folder with everything you need to know!
I'm so happy we went to him and would recommend to anyone!</text>

Dr. Phi is a very nice and caring dentist, one of the best!!! Their place of business and facility is top notch. They really thought of the well being of the kids with the tv’s setup on the ceiling facing down for the kids to see when they lay down on the dental seat, and not only that, they were very thoughtful to give free tokens/coins (x2) for the mini arcade room they have provided. A pleasure and an overall great experience!!!< /text>

This was my second time visiting Dr. Yazdi's office for infant Frenectomy. He did my sons back in 2017 and I brought my daughter in recently. I can't begin to even describe all the reasons you should feel comfortable bringing your child here, but to begin you should know, Dr. Shervin Yazdi is the best in the business, he's widely recognized as one of the most respected doctors for infant Frenectomy in the United States. I actually found his office through a national lip & tongue tie group and thankfully his office was near my home. He's extremely knowledgeable And thorough in explaining the procedure. Also, don't think he has something to "sell" neither of my children had tongue ties along with their lip tie (which is rare) and he was honest that they did not need the procedure. He could have easily told me they did, how would I know? But that's not the kind of person he is. Your care doesn't just end after your procedure either, he always follows up with a call. The actual office space itself is immaculate! Overall, I trust My Dr. Yazdi to care for my children which I think says it all. I wish I could give 10 stars.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Yazdi was knowledgeable, thorough, patient and personable. Making the decision to reverse our infant’s tongue and lip tie felt much better with the level of expertise and advice that we received from Dr. Yazdi. He came highly recommended by many friends and strangers alike, which is why we decided to see him. Highly recommend seeking his service if you have any issues with ties.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808f918906f7cba1:0x46b6d951c28f7de<//gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

We had a wonderful experience here with Dr. Yazdi. We came for a consultation and actually did not end up going through with the procedure; however, Dr. Yazdi spent plenty of time with us to made sure that we understood everything and was very helpful. He was very kind and friendly, as was the staff working there.</text>

Our doctor’s, nurses and lactation consultants all tools is that our baby girl did not “seem” to have a lip tie, even though there is family history. I finally had enough and when our girl was 5 months I contacted Dr Yazdi whom I was referred to by family. I should have done it when she was a newborn! She has a significant lip tie and moderate tongue tie which was inhibiting proper and successful nursing. Long term it can also affect speech and teeth. The whole staff was amazing and made arraignments for us immediately, even during the Shelter in Place.. The procedure was quick and our daughter wasn’t even crying by the time she was done. The dr went over the very important aftercare. The through website made sure we were prepared before going to our appointment with immediate aftercare needs So we didn’t need to visit a store after our appointment. Dr Yazdi was very patient and informative. Great experience!< /text>

Dr. Luong is by far one of the best doctors I have come across. I work in the dental field myself and I just love everything about her. She’s the only doctor I know that can keep my crazy child in a calm state of mind. She’s very to the point, and I love that. Great doctor! 5 stars all the way. I can’t thank her enough for her time and patience.<//Review>

<text>Everyone there seems really friendly! We had Dr. Franklin, and she sang to my frightened two year old while we both held her, and she did her exam. They even gave my baby a toy to play with, and a book to read, while we were waiting. They also gave her a token to use in their game room! I'm a gamer, so I geeked out. She used her token to get a toy, and she's still playing with it. ♥️<//text>< Pics>

My boys love this place! Everyone is a bit apprehensive about going to the dentist... with this place my boys have never felt that way. My boys love this place because everyone that works here is friendly and sincere. We saw Dr. Franklin  and she is amazing!! She has incredible energy, is positive, optimistic, she is really lovely. My boys were smiling most of the time. Dr. Mullen is also fantastic! If my dentists were as sweet as these two women then I wouldn’t be so terrified of the dentist today, lol.</Text>

<text>Dr. Yazdi and the team are friendly, welcoming and professional. After having our consultation with Dr. Yazdi and his assistant regarding our 3month old daughter lip & tongue ties we felt well informed and zero pressure to have the procedure performed. They gave us time to decide if we wanted to move forward and when we decided to go ahead and do the procedure they were very comforting to us and our daughter as they took her and brought her back. They were also extremely patient as we attempted breastfeeding in the office. Would highly recommend them! Also, their office was absolutely beautiful & clean! The exam room was very comfortable and didn’t feel like an exam room at all.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

My first time bringing my daughter to this office was a great experience! From when we first walked in the door everyone spoke and was very welcoming. My daughter Ariel is only two and is very scared of any doctors office. Prior to the doctor coming out to examine her teeth the nurse played with Ariel trying to get her to be comfortable. She was fine until it was time for her to lay back and open her mouth.. even though she cried and screamed they sang songs to her while they were examining and kept reassuring her that she was ok. As a mom I really appreciated everything and everyone from the first step into this office. This will definitely be her dentist home until she moves on from pediatrics. Thank you!< /text>

<review>Very nice facility and wonderful staff! Dr. Luong was amazing! She was extremely kind and thorough. Our presence and time was valued, as everyone was extremely pleasant and my son and I were in and out very quickly. The game room was a really nice touch at the end of treatment..brilliant idea! This was the best dental office experience yet! Thanks so much!

<review>Dr. Yazdi has surgically treated both my kiddos for severe upper lip and tongue ties. With my first, I was ready to give up breastfeeding I was in so much pain. Post-surgery, we were able to continue breastfeeding until he was two and a half. With my second, we recognized the issues early and sought surgery. He went from weekly weight checks and concern about his low weight percentile (under 10%) to being in the 70th percentile at his four-month visit. Dr. Yazdi's expertise in this area is so appreciated, and the intervention of doing surgery early, followed by seeing a lactation consultant, has made all the difference for my kids' health and our breastfeeding journeys.<//review><resp>None< /resp></record>

<review>Dr. Yazdi and his team are amazing! Very friendly and professional they make you feel in secure capable hands, especially when you have to do a procedure on a 2-months old baby. Our lactation consultant recommended Dr. Yazdi for tongue tie procedure for our daughter and it all went very smoothly! In couple seconds the procedure was completed and in another 5min our baby was smiling:) thank you Doctor!</review>< Rate>

I want to say the entire staff is amazing from the front desk working with to get me in even after I screwed up my son’s appointment time. To the efficiency of getting seen. Dr. Franklin and her assistant was so amazing with me and my son they explained everything and made us both feel comfortable. If you have a child who may be afraid of the dentist I suggest Dr. Franklin. I’m so excited I stumbled on this Gem.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>We were taken back before our appointment time. The dental assistant spent time going over some logistics and once we confirmed we were going to go through with it, the doctor came in and did the consultation. He was very thorough and up front with what we needed. Baby was gone for less than 3 minutes, they brought him back to the waiting room, turned down the light and had an amazing chair for me to rock and nurse him in. Once I was finished Dr. Yazdi came back, made sure we knew exactly how to do the stretches and aftercare before we left. 10/10 would recommend</review>< pics>

They have a little play area while you wait for your appointment and a little arcade after!
Very efficient with the pre-visit online check-in. My appointment was on time as well.
Very friendly hygienists and dentist. We saw Dr Mullen.
After his appointment, it’s been much easier to get my 22month old to brush (and even floss!!!).
I’ve already recommended them to friends. I’m sure we’ll be going here for years!</Review>

We went to another highly rated oral surgeon who said she needed to be put under with anesthesia. He was very clinical and cold. I went to Dr. Yazdi for a second opinion. After taking the x-ray and explaining the procedure in detail with his recommendation, we did not need to have my daughter sedated after all. With a little bit of laughing gas and numbing the tooth, he was able to do the extraction in a matter of seconds. He was absolutely amazing with my seven year old daughter who was so calm and had no anxiety with Dr. Yazdi. The offices were immaculate. The team from the reception to the dental assistants were beyond friendly and kind. My daughter said " I want to always come to this dentist"! I can't say enough about my experience.<//text>< rate>

<review>Dr Yazdi's team was extremely organized and easy to work with--it was very easy to make an appointment that week. At our appointment, everything was explained to us in detail, and all of our questions answered. As a health care provider myself, I can say that we received excellent care and that Dr Yazdi went above our expectations in terms of time spent with us, as well as  patient education and bedside manner.< /review>< Pics>

We have had the pleasure of visiting both Dr. Mullen and Dr. Franklin and both dentists are so very kind, even on the days my son is less then cooperative. I highly recommend this pediatric dentistry to any family looking for dental care for their children. They have a play structure in the front waiting area. TVs in the exam rooms. And an arcade/reward area for the kids afterwards.<//Review>

So glad I was referred to this Pediatric Dental Office by Dr. MUZIO. Every experience here has been more than wonderful and pleasant. You couldnt ask for or hope for a more than professional and friendly staff. They are all lovely people and have been a blessing to me and my children. The location and ambiance of the office is what anyone would want- it is so comfortable, fun and well kept. Your children will thank you for choosing them!< /Review>

Dr. Yazdi and his staff were terrific. They truly made our experience very pleasant considering the circumstance of our LO needing four severe ties released. Dr. Yazdi was very thorough in explaining the details of the procedure, very calm and reassuring and provided great after care instruction. The procedure was very fast and our LO did great. His office staff was very helpful too. Highly recommend him!<//Text>

Was my sons first official dentist visit. We had tried twice taking him to our family dentist but no such luck completing the exam. The assistant that did my sons cleaning and X-rays was absolutely fabulous. I could tell that she loves her job and loves kids. She made my son feel comfortable which put his father and I at ease. Everyone we dealt with at Dr Yarzi's office was fantastic. Dr Shin was remarkable explaining things to my husband and I. A couple of the technicians had kids that attended my sons previous preschool which made me feel a lot more comfortable knowing that was in good hands.<//Text>

Great dentist!  Dr. Mullen and the staff are definitely geared for kids.  Took my daughter as a 3 1/2 year old, no problems.  They made her first experience very gentle.</text>

<review>Absolutely loved Dr. Yazdi and his staff. We drove 1.5 hours just to go have him perform the tie revision based on other rave reviews. My daughter's procedure was in 2018.

Addition: We just took our son last week to have his ties revised by Dr. Yazdi and it was another great experience. I appreciate how knowledgeable and professional he is when presenting the information. I highly recommend him.< /review>< UserId.>

< Review>
Once again, Dr. Yazdi saves the day! After having two kids with severe posterior tongue ties & lip ties, and 3 Lactation Consultations tell me my recent new born was NOT tongue tied, Dr. Yazdi was able to diagnose and correct her tongue/lip tie at 3 days old. She is now breastfeeding easily and painlessly. She will not have all the subsequent issues my older two had because it was caught so early.< /Review>

I was very nervous and hesitant about the procedure-they treated me with respect and after educating me still gave me grace and support with my decision to go through with the procedure. The staff are helpful and go out of their way to make EVERYONE in the family feel comfortable and welcome. What a team they have!

I can say with 100% certainty Dr. Yazdi was worth the drive with my two week old!! The office is very clean and his staff is so friendly. Dr. Yazdi is very nice and knowledgeable and makes sure you are making informed choices about your baby's health. He explained everything so well and answered all of our questions and just took such good care of our baby boy. The procedure took like two minutes and my son was back in my arms nursing away like nothing happened. Dr. Yazdi took a lot of time going over the after care with us and making sure we felt confident leaving his office. I can't recommend him enough!

<rate>5</rate><text>Dr Yazdi was excellent. The office is clean, well run, beautifully decorated and very professional. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. Dr. Yazdi was thorough, paid attention to detail, spent a lot of time with us explaining our sons anatomy. I had been told by pediatricians, lactation consultants that my son did not have any tongue or lip ties but Dr. Yazdi saw them immediately and explained how they caused all my symptoms( nipple cracking, bleeding, pain and blisters) and my sons issues (shallow latch, long feed times, clicking, dripping milk out of his mouth and fussiness and gas). We were given all the info and time to decide, we felt well informed going into the procedure and my son was out of my arms for 90 seconds! He came back and I was so nervous because they wanted him to breastfeed right away. What do you know, no pain!! He latched perfectly, ate for 20 minutes and fell asleep. Before his procedure I was doing 90% bottle feeding and now we’re 100% on the breast! We’re so grateful for Dr. Yazdi and his work- he went through all the instructions very well, took his time with us and even gave us his cell for any questions or concerns!! He saved my breastfeeding journey. I am forever grateful!!< /text>< Pics>

My grandchildren were visiting g from out of town and my 5 yr old grandson awoke in the night with a toothache.  I found Dr. Franklin, on Google. I am so glad I did.
From the first phone call, I was impressed.  A cheerful person answered, heard my plight and fit me in. The office is kid friendly! We came fully loaded with 5 kids total and it could have been insane, but the playhouse saved us.  The RDA was Cas. She was gentle, attentive and kind.  Dr. Franklin was great with the my grandson and his curious cousin. Dr. Franklin spoke to my grandson, asked him questions, listened and it was obvious, like everyone else we had encountered, she loves her job.
My grandson did not have an abscess or even decay.  Dr. Franklin didn’t think he needed an X-ray and made some suggestions about what to expect in the future based on her exam.  She was informative and gentle and should be known as a person of integrity.  All of the staff are efficient, professionals that appear to like what they do.  I will be back and highly recommend them! También hablan Español!<//text>

Both Dr. Yazdi and his staff were friendly and clearly very knowledgeable and experienced treating both tongue and lip tie. He spent time explaining the condition and the treatment he would provide making me feel comfortable with the procedure for my little one. He has the newest technology with the carbon dioxide laser and truly cares about providing good service to his patients.<//text></record></dataset><record>

My son has seen Dr. Yazdi as a young child.  He was always excellent and I highly recommend him.  I strayed to another dentist office as my son got a bit older simply because it was closer and more convenient, and I regret that decision greatly!!!  We went back to this pffice after a horrible experience at this other commercial dentist office, and we were seen by Dr. Franklin.  She was absolutely wonderful.  My son left there saying how much better she was, and that she made him so much more comfortable than the other place.  He was seen by Dr. Yazdi from age 2-6 so he doesn't remember much about those visits, but I do, and he was wonderful.   My son is now almost 11, and left Dr. Franklin as a very happy boy, even after finding out he needed some work done!!! She kept him distracted by talking to him throughout the check-up, included him in the conversation, and taught him some things he can do to help himself.  He was at home later, talking about how he couldn't have this snack, and that he should have water because he had juice earlier, so she made an impression to say the least!! I will never take either of my kids anywhere else.  Also, the office staff was incredible!!  The customer service, attentiveness, and overall pleasant attitudes that everybody had was much appreciated!!  No hiccups or hoops to jump through.  You would hope that this was the norm anywhere, but unfortunately it is not, and it is a breath of fresh air to have a business run so successfully!! Thank you very much to everybody here!!

A very pleased mom,
Stephanie P.</review>

<Review>I commuted from Mountain View because my lactation consultant at El Camino Los Gatos recommended Dr Yazdi in Castro Valley. I realize that was like bay-area BINGO, but all kidding aside, this Dr was more than worth the drive. Not only is his practice very professional, with a fantastic staff, and state-of-the-art equipment, they're incredibly understanding and compassionate for new parents who are seeing help for their infants' tongue-tie/frenectomy. Both my daughters ended up needing frenectomy and I couldn't have hoped for a more caring and experienced doctor, which was the peace of mind I needed after having a new baby that was struggling with breast feeding and bottle feeding.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

<Review>Saw Dr Yazdi for lip and tongue frenectomies on 2 separate occasions for each of my kids. The office is very clean and nice, each room has a comfortable chair for breastfeeding which is encouraged. All the staff were also kind and Dr Yazdi himself is the best, he really explains the procedure and expected outcomes based on the individual patient exam. My first child was revised at 9 months and the second was 5 days old, both have had great outcomes. I recommend him to anyone who suspects ties!< /Review>< pics>

We were referred to Dr. Yazdi by our lactation consultant, Paula Santi, as a result of chronic breastfeeding issues (pain and recurring clogged ducts due to baby’s inefficient eating). Our LC recommended that we have a consultation for tight frenulum and consider frenectomy. We sought consultations with 2 doctors from Kaiser because we initially wanted to stay within our insurance network if we did decide to have the procedure. However, both Kaiser doctors seemed to know little about the mechanics of breastfeeding and convinced us that it was unlikely the procedure would have any effect on our breastfeeding experience. After the Kaiser consultations, we didn’t think we would have the procedure done. However, we didn’t want to give up hope of being able to breastfeed our son. So, when we shared the Kaiser experience with Paula, she suggested that we see Dr. Yazdi. I can’t even begin to say how happy I am that we took her advice. Dr. Yazdi was very knowledgeable on the subject as well as how ties impact the mechanics of breastfeeding. He took his time answer our extensive questions, and really listened to our concerns. We did not feel pressured at all to have the procedure. In response to others who say that he comes on strong, like he’s making a sales pitch, I would say, in our experience, he does have a “pitch” but I think that he’s just trying to explain the mechanics of breastfeeding and how the anatomy of the baby’s mouth needs to work together to breastfeed effectively. This involves educating the patient, and my husband and I appreciated that educational piece of the consultation; perhaps others do not. Also, I’m not questioning others who say he pressured them to have the procedure...maybe he did. But, that was not our experience. He gave us the room to talk it over, and we decided to have the tongue and lip tie corrected that day. The procedure itself was incredibly fast. The baby came out with a little blood on his lip. We were told that is normal, and, indeed, the bleeding stopped right away, and he nursed immediately. The first feed I used a nipple shield so could not gauge if the pain associated with his latch diminished, but he seemed to be eating pretty efficiently. The second feed after the procedure I nursed without the use of the shield and that’s when I became a firm believer that this procedure can have amazing results. After months of struggling with blistered and bleeding nipples, my baby finally latched with no pain and had a full feed in 30 minutes. He was so milk drunk afterwards. It was amazing. He did become pretty fussy that night and we were assured that’s to be expected. Since the procedure yesterday we’ve had multiple feeds without the use of the nipple shield, with no pain to me and a well fed, satisfied baby. I know that this doesn’t work for everyone and that results are not always so immediate, but for us it was incredible, and I’m so glad we decided to have it done by Dr. Yazdi and his wonderful team!<//text>

I and my husband, for our family with four children, always have an amazing experience with Dr. Yazdi and his office. Dr. Yazdi is extremely knowledgeable, calm, caring, and excited and passionate about his work. We originally saw Dr. Yazdi for the first time for a frenectomy for my son as a baby four years ago, when our pediatrician alerted us to a possible tongue tie. We appreciated Dr. Yazdi’s high-tech laser treatment and professional experience in this specialty. He also took the time to educate us and call our home personally as well as offer his personal cell phone to follow-up after the procedure. We’ve continued to see him regularly for our three older children’s regular dental needs. The staff members are all very helpful, cheerful, caring, and patient. Dr. Yazdi and his staff all have great bedside manner with kids and parents! The children take counsel seriously and try to improve dental hygiene habits. The cleanings are good, and no child has had any cavities under Dr. Yazdi’s care. My kids also love watching the latest kids movies on the ceiling from their dental chairs, playing in the fun castle in the lobby, and getting to use their tokens for the game and prize room at the end of the visit. Dr. Yazdi always remembers the children’s histories and follows up with specific needs, including accurate recommendations for orthodontic consults, smoothing a chipped tooth and making sure the root was not damaged free of charge, and applying sealants. The front desk staff is very good at following up with insurance and making sure treatments are covered by insurance, too. Thank you! We also like the location and have enjoyed lunching at the nearby restaurants or hiking at the Lake Chabot Park or attending the Chabot Space and Science Center after school after an appointment.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Yazdi, came highly recommend by our pediatrician and lactation consultant.  From the moment we walked in the door his associates were warm and caring and took their time to explain our options and make us feel like we had brought our child to a safe place.

Dr. Yazdi shared a very impassioned perspective with my wife and I.  He thoughtfully walked us through his diagnosis and shared photographs of our child’s mouth to help us gain a better understanding of what we he would be correcting.  He and his team gave us a wealth of information, they were very patient with us and gave us ample time to decide on our own what we wanted to do.  No pressure.

We decided to move forward on the same day as our consultation and our child did really well, there was no crying.  We hung around for some time after the procedure to breast feed and Dr. Yazdi took the time to review everything with us again before we left his office.

My wife and I were impressed with his practice and his bedside manner.  He’s awesome.

Considering how scary it felt bringing our two month old child in to do this, we left feeling like we had made the right choice.  It’s been about four days since the procedure and we and the pediatrician have already seen a notable improvement in our child’s ability to breastfeed and gain weight.

Thank you Dr. Yazdi</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

It was absolutely worth the 5+ hour drive each way to see him. I wish we were closer because we would go to him for other things aswell!<//text>< time>

I’m extremely grateful for Dr. Yazdi. It’s only been 3 days since our son had his tongue and lip ties corrected by Dr. Yazdi’s frenectomy procedures, but I wanted to post because of how well our baby is breast feeding now. He had been diagnosed with minor posterior tongue tie by Kaiser Hospital, but Kaiser hospital missed his lip tie and the surgeon from Ear, Nose, throat stated there is no difference in expectant prognosis had we used them for the frenectomy vs. no intervention at all. Our son was not able to latch well and my wife had so much pain. We were pumping 50% and breast feeding with nipple shield about 50%. So we went to Dr. Yazdi after recommendation from our Lactation Consultant... Now after 3 days, it’s already 100% breastfeeding 75% with no shield and it is going great. Dr. Yazdi said his procedure will have a ripple effect in helping with breastfeeding. I will attest that the effect is huge especially because now that our son is breastfeeding so well, he has a lot less gas, is playing so much more, so calm and a lot more comforted when he is not sleeping and feeding. He used to be so fussy it was so much work to calm him and I think a lot of his change is because breastfeeding is going so well now.< /text>

<Text>Dr. Yazdi helped our 2 month infant daughter undergo a second frenectomy to remove a tongue tie. The first done at a regional hospital in SF and was poorly performed and loosely explained, which caused a reattachment. Dr. Yazdi and his staff were very knowledgeable, courteous and helped us weigh the risks and rewards carefully. They ensured that we had a very clear understanding of wound care through handouts, hand exercises and a trial run to prevent reattachment. For parents considering a doctor with an expertise in infant oral care, I would not hesitate to recommend this practice and his amazing team.< /Text>< Time>

Dr. Yazdi expertly diagnosed and treated my newborn's lip and tongue tie. My son had been unable to stick out his tongue and feeding was a nightmare. He had lost a great deal of weight and I almost gave up on breastfeeding when I was finally referred to Dr. Yazdi. The procedure was only minutes and because he uses a state-of-the-art laser (rather than surgically cutting the ties) there was no bleeding at all afterwards. I was able to nurse my son right away and his latch and feeding problems have finally resolved. I was very happy with Dr. Yazdi's professional and warm bedside manner. He helped me feel at ease with the procedure and I couldn't be happier with the results. The office staff are friendly and the office is new, clean and modern. Even though the office is over an hour away I am considering taking my son to see Dr. Yazdi for all his dental care, he's that good!</text>

A lady named Jasmine doesnt attend you right if people she knows enters and gives her whole attention to them. Ignoring to see if we or any other customers need anything.

They do not know how to prepare food in the Michoacán style.

They charge you for any detail that other places have with the food.

For example, they charged me for pickled peppers in an order of enchiladas, and just one chile AND dried the enchiladas.
I had to ask them for tomato sauce to fix them.

Because neither cheese nor sauce nor chili peppers
The situation is sad I pay dearly

For two little plates for a child

Muy excesivo los precios
No saben preparar la comida al estilo Michoacán .

Te cobran cualquier detalle que en otros lugares ban con la comida .

Por ejemplo me cobraron por chiles en vinagre en una orden de enchiladas, y nomás tría un chile Y secas las enchiladas .
Me tocó pedirles salsa de tomate para arreglarlas.

Porque ni queso ni salsa ni chiles llevaba
Es triste la situación I pagamos caro

Por dos platitos para niño 😤😤😤

I love that there are several sandwich options in this neighborhood. I was intrigued by the italian sandwiches from Handy Deli and decided to try it out a couple of weeks ago.

I got the Bella Vista, which has a mountain of prosciutto, fresh mozz, and grilled eggplant, with a walnut pesto spread and finished on a panini press. Every italian sandwich comes with a side salad, which is great! All in all, it was delicious, but it was just a tiiiiiiny bit too salty. Next time, will have to try a different sandwich. I'm particularly interested in the bistro sandwich.

The deli is quite small and gets a bit crowded around lunch time. I suggest calling ahead so you don't have to wait inside for your order< /text>

<Review>This place is scenic on Pier 39 in the toruristy area but hey, I'm a tourist and I just want some good seafood!

Fog Harbor fish house plates beautifully ! And the the seafood is actually so fresh! We got a crab dish, fried calamari and some grilled shrimp and fish! It was delish. The restaurant is pretty and the staff is polite.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>The sandwiches here consistantly delicious! The chicken in particular is so good! It's tender and flavorful, well seasoned, and that rosemary smell really hits you as soon as you come in. And everyone who works here has been so nice! They're always friendly and have shared some great sandwich recommendations with me. I definitely stop here when I'm craving a sandwich in the neighborhood.<//review>< user>

Skip the single use plastic, ask for a bowl!

Ubatuba has some of the best Acai in town. Recently found out that they have ceramic bowls buried in the back to use if you're eating there, be sure to request one!< /text>

Not all their sandwiches are spectacular, but the pastrami Ruben is. The cooks are quick and crafty. The three different cashiers I've interacted with were all very unfriendly dudes. They could polish up on their customer service skills.</Text>

My only complaint is that he's been stocking so much good beer (faster than it's selling) that it is losing it's freshness. IPAs do not benefit by time and I can taste it in my favorites. :/</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x8085876586c9a2db:0xd12051ed72e11c1a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I consider myself a pretty knowledgeable guy on Rubens. I order them everywhere and rate them on a scale of 1-10. I have a list of a few dozen locations; it's a little nerdy but it's who I am and what I do. This deli forced me to adjust my scale because they made a Ruben so delicious that it knocked my socks off. I want to drive the 22 hours back there for that sandwich. I think about it a lot.

My white whale that has ruined all future sandwiches for me.

I would recommend these guys.<//text>< name>

Ammmmmmaaazing!!! The food that they make tastes like home made food! If I can eat here everyday, I would;)

Jerry and his wife are so friendly, this place is awesome.

I had the chicken with rice and beans, also the soup was fantastic. I've always ordered sandwiches and they were always great but now I've been ordering their hot meals;;;)< /text>

< Review>
Awesome little nondescript deli on the corner of 19th and Irving. Stopped in for a snack on the way to the airport. Straight forward liquor store with fifteen foot wall ceilings of just about every bottle you can imagine, plus a big wine selection (cold also available). But tucked into a corner near the cash register is a selection of grab-and-go homemade items like hummus, falafel, and dolmas. Such good quality food!! Will absolutely make this a stop every time I head to SFO.<//Review>

The lunch specials never disappoint!

The Hot and Sour soup is one of the best I’ve tried.<//Review>

There good is great but there customer service with other races are terrible. And I am just telling you the honest-to-god truth because I've been coming here for years and every single time it's a problem with me asking them for more sweet and sour sauce ask for one if she continued told me I only need one when I told her I want another one she told me to get lost they don't respect their customers that continue to come in to keep them business I don't need to be disrespected coming in spending my money next time I will resort alter and change the environment in the restaurant with having to raise my voice but I will not let anybody take me out of my character so I took this time to give them a review that is honest to God I will commend them on even though their customer service is terrible the food is amazing hate them but I love them but I hate them so if you decide to go in there be prepared for a very angry lady taking your order and possibly upsetting you and if she doesn't okay she might have just only victimized me</review>

We’ve been ordering from here for about 10yrs now. The staff is always friendly and the delivery guy is so nice and has smile every time. The food is good, decent price and packed to the top. We usually order the fish with black bean sauce and chicken porridge.< /Review>

We tried this restaurant for the first time today, take out. The containers were packed.  My wife is from Shanghai and knows her Chinese food. We thought the chicken chow mein lacked flavor but the beef chow fun made up for it. It was great and so was the hot and sour soup, very tasty! Cashew chicken was decent. Service was fine and great value for the $. They said it would be 15 minutes but it took 35 minutes so be prepared. Worth the wait. They threw in free wontons as the order was over $30 but we asked for spring rolls instead and they were big and Really good. We'll try them again for sure.< /text>

Food was very good. Portions were decent. Staff is nice too. The area though has become more sketchy in recent years though. Just be aware of your surroundings. Dont leave valuables in view in your car. Put them out of sight.< /Text>

Good lunch, atmosphere needs help. Too cold to spend any time there when waitress wearing their coats, and pig in back booth belching, which sounded like it was coming back up. Won't go back.< /text>

<review>Hands down the best Chinese restaurant in Antioch. The food is always fresh and tastes great.  My go to is usually the broccoli beef, chicken chow mein and hot n sour soup. The prices cant be beat for the quality either. Dont sleep on the lunch/dinner specials if your in a pinch.<//review>< UserId.>

Decent food, pending on what you get.  Chicken dry and rubbery.  I tend to stay away from seafood due to bad experience when they first opened.  The little beef I've had had been pretty good.  The hot and sour soup is worth buying too   Okay interior.  Not so safe shopping center.  But they deliver!< /Review>

Last 3 month food qualitt has gone down hill. Plus they were shut down in 2018 by the county.
This last week they forgot two large items in my delivery, they said they credit. This week go to order my regular 4 items now say i need to add  buy two more large times to get delivered even thou i was using my 2 credited items. Very poor english speaking, reasoning, common sense :/</Review>

Needs Zero Stars!!   Found Pubic Hair in our food, not just one hair, several with the roots attached!!  The previous time the food was so disgusting that we drove the delivered food back to the restaurant UNEATEN to return it.  They refused and had to put a claim in with the Bank which quickly refunded the money to us.  STAY AWAY, reported to health department.<//review>

One of my new favorite local go to places. You get lot of food for your money. They pack and pack and pack until the lid barely closes.

Start with either their Fried Pork Won-Ton or Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings. Go with their Chicken or BBQ Pork Fried Rice and ChiceknChow Mein. For white rice, you can't go wrong with their version of savory Peking Pork Chops and mild Curry Chicken (ask them for extra sauce). The Curry Chicken is not like the Indian type curry that's loaded with spices, and it is not like the Thai curry but it's somewhere in between.  Round it off with some simple fresh vegetables (you can ask them what is fresh) with garlic sauce.

For those that are more adventurous, try their Running Egg and Shrimp over Chow Fun.  It's an egg-gravy style over Chow Fun that's designed to be eaten right away but if you are an egg-lover, this is a must try. Or, opt for their version of Crispy Fried Noodle where the Crispy Noodles come in a box and you get a container of the sauce and toppings to pour on top when you are ready to eat. Another thing to try is their "Eight Treasure Tofu Special" with some white rice, or if it's in season, go for the comfort type food "Bitter Melon and Beef".

And, make sure you order a side of their mini sesame balls that is a great as a palate cleanser, or to go with a cup of tea.

Staff here are very friendly and all their regulars greet the staff here by name, and vice versa. Through it all, they kept things frugal with their decor and limit to what's necessary for good quality food to keep prices low for their customers.</Text>

<Review>I ordered delivery tonight, over $20, to receive free egg rolls and none were with the order for one, the food temp was slightly warm, my walnut shrimp and general chicken were mushy, the fried rice was soaked in soy sauce (which I have never received like this in any other chinese food restaurant), and the delivery guy was rude.
One thing good was the flavor of the General Tso's chicken. But, will Not order from South North Dragon again.</Review><name>Robin N<//name>< GmapID>

< Review>
My very first order from Yelp24!  This meal was enough to feed an army.  I will be eating left overs for days.

I ordered Kung Pao chicken, pan fried noodle special and pork fried rice.  I received egg rolls for free courtesy of Yelp24.

I immediately ate all the crispy (not soggy) rolls.  They tasted like a little piece of heaven or something like that!  Kung Pao chicken was also excellent.  I forgot to recommend spicy when I placed the order but still very tasty.  I was so full but I managed to try the pan fried noodles and I thought it was excellent. Reminded me Top Roman but much better.  It had bok Choy, fish, carrots and some tasty spices.  I wish I would of asked for spicy!

The order came quickly. Fifteen minutes earlier!  That was a first!  I was shocked!

Great meal and lots of left overs!< /Review>

We stopped by here while walking to another place for dinner and man I'm so glad we did.  I love street food and this place is a gem! They have everything you can hope for and more.  Various options for your protein and a self serve style of topping which in my opinion is fantastic, you get to create your taco just the way you like it.  They provide an abundance of everything you would want to add as well as giant tubs of delicious sauces.  Everything about this place is perfect, the vibe, the people and obviously the food.  Definitely a must have if you are in the area or actually even if you are not you should drive over!</text>

Great experience, food, and service.  Does anyone know what the grilled cheese tortilla is?  It's not a quesadilla, but similar.  Can someone post a picture and the name? please : )<//review>

This is quite possibly the best taco spot I've ever been to in all of LA.  I've tried many random carts, taco trucks, restaurants - you name it - but this gem blows them all out of the water.  I remember fondly when they first set up shop two~three years ago, setting up their tables in front of Whole Foods parking lot.  Nowadays, they are the neighborhood staple, commanding long lines for their delicious morsels.  Highly recommend this place and get your fill on some amazing tacos!< /review>

They are by far one of our favorite street tacos. You can't go wrong with the al pastor taco, our personal favorite. You have to try the cucumber with the spicy lemon mix they have</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) They do not use a mask and also the sauces and vegetables all use the same spoon to serve themselves. They have not implemented ANY of the changes needed for Covid.
The tacos are good, but the man who serves them with a despicable attitude when I asked him for a side of beans with broth in a glass because my son with a disability cannot chew and he told me that the glasses are only for fresh waters, I told him He paid him a glass and said that it was 3 dlls for the glass .. In the end he threw the plate and all with a very bad attitude and disposition.

No usan mascarilla y ademas las salsas y verdura todos usan la misma cuchara para servirse. No han implementado NADA de los cambios necesarios para Covid.
Los tacos estan buenos, pero el señor que los sirve con una actitud despreciable cuando le pedí un side de frijoles con caldo   en vaso porque mi hijo con una discapacidad no puede masticar y me dijo que los vasos solo son para las aguas frescas , le dije que le pagaba un vaso y dijo q eran 3 dlls por el vaso .. Al final aventó el plato y todo con muy mala actitud y disposición.<//text>< gmapID>

<Name>Aaron Kangiser< /Name><text>Nice course, very fitting for the area. The layout is large and kind of clunky. If your game is as bad as mine, some of the holes can be intimidating. Three or four of the long par four and fives are right next to a busy street. If you have a bad hook or slice make sure there are no cars coming. On the back nine I hit a house. There are large expensive houses on the golf course. Overall I had a great time, I recommend playing with a coupon as it is very pricey without.<//text>< resp>

A great course and hidden gem.  It's a little tougher than one would think.  I enjoyed it.< /Review>

< Review>
We showed up at 3PM and it was nice and fun until we got kicked out at 6:10PM for “being too slow”. We were just trying to have fun and complete our hole but a man came up to us and told us to stop and turn our golf carts in. He did not let us hit it one last time even though we were on the green, about 10 inches away from the hole. He said he got a complaint about another golfer who said we were just messing around. I believe this is discrimination since we are all Hispanic, and apparently we don’t matter as much as the previous golfer who complained about us.<//Review>

A luscious green golf course. A few small water hazards dot this course but it's the sand boxes you need to worry about. The clubhouse is on the smaller side and is in the same building as the pro shop but it's moderately priced and fun to play.< /review>

I had never golfed before. My first time I showed up to this place with some beer. I didnt know it was against the rules. The lady working the food area was exceptionally rude in her method if informing me of the rules. I had no problem and returned my beverages to my vehicle. But this woman was so infuriated I thought she was going to have a stroke she was so intensely threatening me. Otherwise. I had fun. The guy at the other desk was awesome.< /Text>

<text>Overall a nice golf course, good amount of trees and bends.  Something that is both a positive and negative is that it is right near the water treatment.  So it's almost always nice and green out there but when the wind shifts it can be a bit less pleasant.  Overall good< /text>< pictures>

I am not sure who was running the pro shop, but I ended up waiting in line 3 times because the guy didnt want to give me a cart to go to the parking lot and get our clubs because he was concerned we take off lol!  The guy was annoying, but more importantly terribly inefficient.  He was trying to pawn a topless cart off to some guy in front of me (what a joke, like somebody riding wants to be in the valley sun all day), but I digress, the course was ugly on the front nine, reminded me of Airways in Fresno, and the back was nice.  Better of going to Visalia if you are driving a distance to get there.</review>< rating>

I played the course for the first time while visiting family on Friday September 16.  The course was in overall good shape.  Some of the greens are very big with nice curves.  Noted the lip of the cups were not groomed which caused several missed putts. You have to hit almost dead center to sink a putt.  Also noted numerous ball marks and debris on the greens that needed repair to no fault of the course greens keeper.  (Fix your ball marks guys and gals!!)    Front nine featured some very narrow fairways which proved unfriendly to a fade or draw.  The back nine opened up some and the water holes provided a fair challenge.  Overall I would play the course again when in the area.  A suggestion would be to provide a map of the course, of some signage, that would assist a person, not from the area, with finding the holes on the back nine.  Had to use a number of paved streets to navigate and if I were not with a local, I would still be lost.<//Text>

Do not go on the weekend, it took me 3 and a half hours just to get through the front nine. They seem to care more about taking as many people's money as they can and play experience comes second to them. Take the time, spend the extra $20 and go to Visalia.< /text>

First time hitting this course up and ive got to say i don't know what took me so long, i loved it. Dont be scared by all the cars there, it looks so packed but the course is huge so you are usually not stuck behind other players< /text>

Friendly staff. Front side is short and fairly friendly. Back side much longer and can be tricky. Watch out for houses on back side.<//review>

Terrible experience this morning with Tony at the front desk. Left without playing......he needs to be relieved of his front desk duties, he pushes golfers away from the course.< /review>

It's a great place to golf since it is close, but their prices during the winter are way too high especially for twilight when it's only 40 degrees outside< /review>

Food was delicious! My salad tasted like it was fresh from the farmers market. Their BLT sandwich had so much bacon on it that i could barely get my mouth around it. The tomatoes had so much flavor, like they were vine ripened. Wonderful and unique menu selection. I love that it is family owned and operated, not a chain restaurant. The staff was super friendly and helpful. My next trip will be for the Italian Gelato and coffee drinks. Can't wait to go back.< /text>

<Review>Staff here is super friendly and attentive. Great selection of caffeine products. All the food is good portion and very tasty. The avocado toast looks like it's an entire avocado. Pastries taste good as well. Great little shop that's less crowded than mainstream coffee shops and they have better coffee here too!< /Review>< Pictures>

Nice clean cafe with some indoor seating. Tried the iced coconut caramel macchiato and it was good, but not extraordinary. Mostly tasted the caramel and chewed the coconut pieces. I prefer a more coffee forward drink. Service was friendly but slow in spite of our being the only ones in the cafe when we arrived. Nice to be able to sit inside in AC to visit and enjoy our coffee. My gps had some trouble figuring out how to get me there.</review>

I usually order the Cafe Viennese, but sometimes I just need a straight coffee.

I'm so happy that they have replaced Starbucks in the spot.  It's a small hassle to get to their driveway and parking is a little jammed, but it's worth the time and hassle.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

This was my first visit and I'll be back to try other offerings. I had the bacon harvati on brioche which I enjoyed. Also ordered the cinnful breakfast, also good. Had the intention of cutting it in half so my wife could try it but made a mess of it and had to enjoy it all myself. I'd say this place is an almost 4 stars, may a 4 once intry other dishes<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Josh Drucker my Service Technician and the Office's appointment team At Oak Valley Appliance could have not been more responsive or helpful when my LG Refrigerator went hot in the middle of the week this Jan 2021. Five thumbs up to Jose and his service professionalism . He had the parts in stock for my LG and took the extra effort to trouble -shoot and find the problem ?   I wish you his expertise in fixing any appliance problems when you need it most .    Scott Beery   Tehachapi CA.</review>< pictures>

Jeremy and Scott were amazing! I have a complicated microwave and wasn’t sure if it was able to be fixed but they repaired it very quickly and with no difficulty. They were very clean and any mess that was made was cleaned up (although I really don’t think they made any mess). Would definitely use them again in the future and would greatly recommend them. And a plus/bonus: they have a tracker so you can see where you are in the line for appointments and you can also see when they will arrive. I loved that.</text>

< review>
Josh was amazing? In the first visit, we needed a part, which was a warranty. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I thought it would be a run around after that! Nope! Alex ordered the part. Called me and told me ASAP! It came right to the door. Within days! Melissa called and scheduled a reeeeally doable and quick appt. The fridge stopped working on a Wednesday. It was fixed and up and running, after warranty had been dealt with and parts shipped, by the next Wednesday! Oak Valley and their employees rock! Thanks Josh! You were kind, and did a great job!< /review>

This is an awesome business.  They are caring and responsive technicians.  From the office staff to the technicians thank you.  If there is a problem, they will find an answer. Jeremy was here for the dishwasher and noticed a loose cabinet door and fixed it for me.  Excellent service< /review>

Jeremy came out today and serviced our refrigerator freezer and as always did an exceptional job. He was very thorough with his explanation of the problem and  took care of the issue in a very timely manner. Jeremy has been to our house a few times before and we will request him for any other appliance problems. Thanks so much and keep up the fantastic service.</review>

The professionalism and customer service at Oak Valley Appliance is outstanding! Prior to contacting Oak Valley Appliance, I contacted another appliance repair company who came out and charged me $35 dollars, spent 5 minutes looking at the washer, and told me to buy a new one. Oak Valley quickly found the problem, ordered the part, and repaired my washer! It works like new.😊<//Text>

The home visit was scheduled within 2 days of my call and the technician Jeremy showed up within the time window, giving me a courtesy call a few minutes before. Jeremy was very friendly and knowledgeable. He managed to quickly fix both my fridge and oven during the visit as he had the parts with him. I'm so thankful it wasn't the compressor on the fridge or my wife and I would be going through the oh-so-fun & pricey appliance shopping experience. He/Oak Valley was very fair with pricing and my wife and I appreciated Jeremy's honesty regarding the cost and value of the repair. This was a pleasant experience and we hope nothing breaks again but we will call Oak Valley again when it does :) Thank you!< /Review><user_id>113464265394259189443< /user_id></record>

They take every detail into consideration with the customer before they proceed to make the customer happy. I recommend them and Oak Valley appliance for any repair need.

Tobias was so efficient at fixing my oven.  I will use them for all my appliances going forward.  I was referred to them by AHS.  My new home warranty service.  I had originally contacted the maker of the oven, Whirlpool Factory Service, they could not fix it without a long delay.  I would have been without a oven for weeks.  But Tobias at Oak Valley Appliance, was able to get the part and fix my oven in a matter of minutes.</Review>

<review>I've had them come out a couple times and they always do great work.  They're honest and conservative about what needs to be done - they won't do more than you really need, but they will take care of the problem.  Jeremy was super polite and helpful, and I appreciated him wearing a mask without needing to be asked.  They also had a discount for paying in cash.

I don't worry about appliances having issues because I know I can just call Oak Valley and it'll get fixed easy peasy.</review><Name>Amy Webster<//Name><Rating>5</Rating><Time>1606332947043<//Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

< Review>
WOW!  SO PLEASED!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  My freezer was not freezing so I needed someone to come out SOON.  No one else in the AV could either work on my freezer or could come out quickly Oak Valley was kind of at the bottom of the list due to my distance search but... after calling Oak Valley yesterday, the lady answering the phone was SO polite, professional and thorough. They were able to send a technician out the next day and were SUPER communicative.  Got an email confirmation, got an email to track the technician and also got a call from technician letting me know he was 20 min. away.  Technician was SUPER thorough, nice, polite, and explained everything.  Got my problem fixed super fast and I could not be happier that I called Oak Valley.  I felt good after dealing with them!<//Review>

Our washer stopped working and the company responded right away and sent someone out as soon as possible. Scott was very helpful and made sure I knew what was going on throughout the whole process. He found the issue immediately and had it fixed shortly after. Very quick service. Will definitely use this company again<//Review>

The repairman, Jeremy, was very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Our dishwasher is almost 15 years old and so we decided not to put over $500 into it. But we would use Oak Valley again for other repairs we might need in the future.<//Text>

Josh called in advance, arrived on time was friendly and professional and he was wearing a mask. Excellent service would recommend Josh and I would call again. Also. I reached a live person the first time I called.  I left 3 voice mails at other places, the young lady who answered my call was friendly,  made sure they had someone available and made me feel like they had nothing better to do than fix my issue.< /Text>

<review>Weekend call was made, and response was around 0900 Monday morning, with Advisory that a technician would respond afternoon on same day. The tech arrived around 1400, and intuitively followed clues indicating the fan blowing cool air into the refrigerator had stopped. Upon disassembly, large pieces of ice were blocking fan, a steamer was used to remove ice, reassembly completed, operationally tested and verified. The final fix involved adjustment of the vertical bar between the side by side doors, that completes the seal of the refrigerator. Both doors were raised about 3/16" which re-actuated the vertical seal, which had stopped working correctly due to the weight of stores items in the refrigerator door. Work completed just under two hours of service time!</review>< Pics>

Amazing service! I was late with a dead phone, but Jeremy waited. He was extremely professional, kind, and helpful. He provided me with options that I could afford and answered questions regarding another appliance, even when he wasn’t scheduled for that. I definitely recommend Oak Valley. I have used them for service and bought a part previously. Excellent service each time! Thank you Oak Valley!</Text>

<Name>Deann Ward<//Name><review>I am so impressed by Oak Valley Appliance and their repair specialists!  First off,  the office staff is very pleasant (I believe it was Hilary) and I was placed on the schedule right away. The communication is outstanding from the first phone call all the way until the job is complete. Repairs were necessary for my dryer and refrigerator.  Oak Valley had one of the parts for the refrigerator in stock and they returned the next day to install the part.  The other part had to be ordered as well as a part for the dryer.  I didn't have to wait long, they were back at the beginning of the  next week, it would have been quicker but I was out of town.  These repair men are professional, courteous, knowledgeable, quick to assess the issues and efficient.  I felt the charges were very fair for the repairs.  It has been a very long time since I can say that a company has stellar customer service, this one more than a 5 STAR rating.  A big shout out to Jeff and Jeremy!

We had Oak Valley appliances come out and it was a great experience.  The appointment was easy to set up and quick and friendly. Josh the technician was great.  I kept asking him questions about the repair, he didn’t hesitate to answer all of my questions and actually looked further into the problem than the last company. He found a leak that was not previously diagnosed and was able to fix it on the spot. He had all the parts and had my refrigerator up and running in a very timely matter. Highly recommended!!< /text>

The Tech arrived and was very professional, diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes and had me back up and running within an hour.  Great service company, highly recommended!<//review>< Pictures>

I called Oak Valley Appliance for repairs on my Maytag washer fully expecting to be scheduled days out. I was surprised to hear that they would send a repairman out on the same day. Within 4 hours of my call a wonderful young man named Jeremy was at my door. He was very pleasant, professional and thorough in diagnosing the repair needed for my washer. He explained everything to me and showed me the problem and the part that needed to be replaced. He quickly did the necessary repair and my washer is back in service! It was a pleasure having Jeremy be my repairman today. I will definitely call and request Jeremy if I need service on my appliances in the future.</Text>

Plus, Jeremy, the tech that has come to our house, is very professional and does a great job explaining his diagnosis and his recommended repair. Again, first-rate!

One last thing--I love their uniforms!  There is no doubt who the techs work for.

Jeremy and Scott were so helpful and professional with fixing my refrigerator. They diagnosed my microwave and were not able to fix it. They spoke with my warranty company and was able to have them both covered. They did a great job, answered all our questions and I will highly recommend them to anyone.

<text>I requested this company from my AHS (American Home Shield) after I read their reviews.  The company response time, professionalism, knowledge and experience are 5 star ratings.   Not only did they fixed my dishwasher, dryer and washing machine in a reasonable time frame, Tobias was very helpful .  I enjoyed this young man coming out to my house Tobias was very professional and he explained to me what was going on with my appliances every step of the way and how to maintenance them.    If you are in need of your appliances service make sure you go to OAK Valley   there customer service and online app keep you updated of your invoice and  track your technician which is way cool.  Don't forget to ask for Tobias.   Thanks again OAK VALLEY< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Pictures>

< Review>
My built-in GE microwave started sounding funny and wouldn't heat. I was out of warranty and the GE service line gave me the run-around. Called Oak Valley. They have been very reliable in the past. Jeremy from OV diagnosed the problem, a bad magnetron, and gave me a quote. I checked the cost of a replacement microwave and decided to go with the repair. After waiting a few days for the part to arrive at Oak Valley, Jeremy was back and had the microwave fixed and reinstalled within an hour. Friendly service, experienced expertise, and conscientious workmanship. Can't ask for more. And based right here in Tehachapi!< /Review>

I just wanted to let everyone know, I normally don't take the time to post good things about products/companies. Oak Valley Appliance came into my home today for a repair, what a great value they have in Jeremy!  He was very professional and his knowledge about his work was VERY refreshing in our times!< /Text>

They were always here within an hour of the 4 hour timeframe they give you(that never happens!). They even give you a call to let you know they are finishing up at the precious job and headed over.

She was very friendly, professional, and was able to work me in the same day for service!  My tech Jeremy was super professional, polite, friendly, and took every measure possible to provide a safe experience which was very reassuring given the current Covid-19 crisis.  He wore a mask, gloves, and even shoe coverings!  I was very impressed!  Additionally, Jeremy was extremely knowledgeable in discussing the details of my refrigerator repair and readily explained every step of the repair, which I really appreciate.  Jeremy and his company provide excellent quality services at a very affordable and quite reasonable price. I highly recommend Jeremy and Oak Valley Appliance!!!!  You won’t go wrong in utilizing this company for your repair needs!!!</Review>< name>

He and the Staff of Oak Valley appliances are very professional, they schedule your appointments in a very timely manner and allow you to check on your technicians progress through the day so you know when he should be arriving.
If you require appliance repair you can not go wrong calling this place, if it's warranty company work or your own repairs Oak Valley is an awesome place to work with. 5 Stars to the Oak Valley Appliance team.<//review>

<Review>Our washer was leaking water into the basket.  We have used this repair company before and have been happy with the results.  Jeremy the repair technician came out and diagnosed the problem as a faulty valve.  Due to back orders it took several weeks to get the replacement part; Oak Valley called regularly to provide updates on status.  Once the part was obtained they scheduled a prompt service call and Jeremy returned to quickly repair the washer, which now works great.  While he was there he also noted that one of the water hoses to the washer had rusted at the connection so he replaced both of those, which saved us from a potential flood in the laundry room.  Oak Valleys people were prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, and professional.  I highly recommend them for any appliance repair needs you may have.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1599503151757, 'text': "We're so glad to hear that you were satisfied with your service, Mr. Ludicke.

My washer and dryer was in perfect working condition. I just wanted a yearly maintenance service. Tobias was AMAZING! First off the company reminds you via recorded message when they will be arriving at your home and he arrived on time. Tobias was very nice and extremely thorough. He explained everything. He was very honest and went above and beyond what I thought he would do. Even updated the motherboards on my washer and dryers which I though was very neat.  A free extra added bonus. He also told me there's a 6 mo warranty so they will come back out if there's any issues. This is an amazing company with excellent customer service. Tobias definitely earned and deserves a raise!

Highly recommend this company! My dryer was screeching,  so, I called Lowe's since it's still under an extended warranty and this was the company sent over. Jeremy was the repair technician that figured it out quick.  Very professional attitude with great customer  service not your typical repair guy.<//review>

<text>This is the only company we will ever use to repair our appliances.  The technicians they have sent have always been kind, knowledgeable, and professional. Last time they helped us for over a month to get a refund for our broken fridge from the manufacturer. This time we were helped byJeremy. He goes above and beyond in his effort to explain the problem and assist you. When he left, we felt informed and unpressured about our options to fix or replace our dryer.</text>< user_name>

The four hour time window with threat of $40 fine if we weren’t available during the entire window was a bit annoying and unnecessary, as well as the robo call confirming appointment that I thought was a scam at first, but once on site the technician was knowledgeable and personable and fixed the problem quickly. He even came back a second time after running into a communication/approval issue and needing a call back from the property manager. Overall would have liked an actual appointment time but the service was very good and I would recommend them.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>My Frigidaire Gallery Stove tops gas valve broke.  This caused the top left burner to not turn off, to turn it off I had to turn the gas valve off.  I call Oak Valley, they were on time and communicated and even gave me a 15 min heads up call.

Jeremy and Scott were professional, courteous and wore a mask the entire time they were in our home.  He explained to me that the valve was broken and needed to be replaced.  He spent 15 mins researching the part and told me it was on back order, no ETA would be given.  And that the part might be end of life.  He gave me the part number, I researched it and no one had it.  Since the stove top is 10 years old  the manufacture isn't required to make parts anymore.

With knowing this I ordered a new stove top, after 3 weeks of the initial consultation I purchased a new stove top from Lowes.  I received a call a day later from Oak Valley, telling me that they received the part.

They were able to fix my stove top and save me $2k.  My range is back to working order, and I couldn't be happier.  I without hesitation recommend them for any repairs.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1610401969182, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving us your feedback on our services, Glenn.

<Text>Jeremy,  the service tech who came to our home to repair our ice maker, was friendly, professional and very knowledgeable.  Jeremy went the extra mile by taking apart the entire ice maker to remove all of the ice that had built-up, and he made sure the ice maker was working properly before he left.  We have ice again!  Thanks Jeremy!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I can’t say enough great things about this company. First, their communication was beyond amazing. Second, they utilize technology but providing a tracking app do you know when and where you technician is and when he will be at your place.
Josh was very professional and fixed my issue this first time. Very  courteous and friendly
Highly recommend!<//text>

When something goes wrong it's nice to have someone knowledgeable to help.  Our wash machine started leaking and wouldn't drain from the rinse cycle.  Jeremy came out and diagnosed the problem, he had the part in his van, and he replaced it.  He also gave some great tips to avoid any future problems.  He was extremely professional and very helpful.  I couldn't be pleased more.< /Review>

<review>What a great experience! We will never go anywhere else. They were very professional, on time, had the parts that we needed and even called us sooner when they had a cancellation.  With all that being said we just wanted to give a personal shout out to Jeremy who went above and beyond to provide Superior customer service my husband could not stop bragging about his service and what a nice guy. Jeremy arrived with a mask and gloves on, great attitude very enthusiastic and just an awesome guy thank you so much! Well done guys<//review><userid>111146277273209306764</userid>< Rate>

<text>Everything about Oak Valley Appliance was superb. From the first contact on the phone, to the reminder, the “on the way” text, to the on time arrival of the technician, to the communication and ultimately the repair of our washing machine - it went perfectly and to my complete satisfaction. Our tech Josh was friendly, professional, efficient and communicated effectively regarding the problem. Luckily, he determined what needed to be fixed, retrieved a new part from his van, and was done in a short time.  Happily, my washer is now back to work and we are thrilled. I would definitely recommend Josh and Oak Valley Appliance. Bravo!! Glad to support this family-owned business (est. 1979).</text>< user_name>

I highly recommend Oak Valley Appliance. They were very efficient in responding to my order I put into American Home Shield for a claim. My first technician was Jeff, he arrived on time and was very friendly and professional. He was excellent in his service with me. My service job was quite complicated, so my last service call was with a second technician named Mike. He was also, friendly, very professional and on time. I have No complaints at all, and in fact I will be personally asking for them when I need any appliance repair in the future.<//review>

Knowing that Oak Valley Appliance had wonderful service the first time they helped with my dryer.  The technician that assisted was Jeremy.  Honestly,  one of the most professional technicians.  Jeremy came in 2018 to fix the dryer and returned just last week.  He remembered the work he had done before and quickly assessed the problem this time.  He worked efficiently and our family could not have been happier with the service he provided.  Oak Valley Appliance is definitely worth every penny.<//text><gmapID>0x80c25b1875f7f833:0x8be7092878b90d31<//gmapID><Date>1593528456720< /Date><pics>None</pics><user_name>Bryan Rasch</user_name><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

They confirmed our appointment by phone and email, they actually responded to an email I sent them, and promptly answered the phone when I called to ask a question!  Who does that? NOT other service people I've had before! My tech, Jeremy, called beforehand, showed up on time, diagnosed the problem quickly, walked me through the process, pricing was fair, and fixed it clean and neat. Thanks, dude!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>First - Melissa took time to talk to me about the issues I was having with my leaking washing machine. She encouraged me to think about whether I should get it repaired or replaced and that I could take my time. As soon as she said that I knew I needed to get it looked at.

So I made the appointment and Mike showed up. He knew exactly what to do and how to do it. He did a thorough check and checked all the codes and found nothing wrong. I had been overloading my machine and causing it to leak. Okay so the problem with my machine was me!!! 😂. So he educated me on load size, detergent amounts, cleaning my machine, and now I will be able to efficiently use my machine!

Thank you both for being a great part of my day!  I truly feel I have found some friends - trusted friends - in both of you!!</Review>< user_name>

<Review>Ice maker broke on extended service plan protected fridge from Lowe's. Called service number and Oak Tree called me the next day to set an appointment. Jeremy arrived on time, had it troubleshot in record time. He had to order the part which took a few days, and he installed it the same week it arrived. Before Jeremy left, he made sure the machine was cycling, gave us precautions (don't use first few trays of ice to avoid contaminants), took the old part and packaging with him, and cleaned up his work area. Jeremy was fast and efficient....and wore a mask and gloves. Great Job Oak Tree and Jeremy!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

The service technician, Jeremy, was outstanding. He was extremely knowledgeable about our refrigerator, and resolved the problem within 20 minutes. He did have to make one return trip to install a new ice-maker, and completed that within 5 minutes. Oak Valley's call system and communication were perfect as well. I highly recommend Oak Valley Appliance for any repairs.< /Review>

I can't remember if it was 20, 25 or 30 years ago the first time I called Oak Valley Appliance.   But I've never called anyone else.

Today, Jennifer took my call and scheduled my appointment.  Jeremy arrived and he was every bit as delightful as Jennifer.   Jeremy went right to work and now, my washer is running like a top.   Yeah!

If your appliances need help, Oak Valley Appliance is the place to call.< /text>

Even though our part was backordered for 3 months they made multiple calls to check in with me to let me know they were still tracking it. Immediately when the part came in they called and scheduled an appt to get it fixed. It was awesome then sent by email a tracking tool so i could see where the technician was as the day went on. Knowing we were job let me know a much closer window when he would be arriving.  He fixed it promptly and gave addl education on how to prevent a problem.  Absolutely reccomend them. Jeremy was awesome.<//Review>< username>

Called with a problem with one of my refrigerators not working properly.  I made an appointment  for the next day. They called me back within 15 minutes and let me know they had a service man  that had time today and if I would be ok with that. He called when he was on his way. Quickly figured  out the problem. Found out he had the part at the shop. Jeremy  ran to the shop got my part and came back and installed  it promptly.   My fridge is back up and running! Thank you guys so very much!!<//text>

Jeremy responded quickly to the service call on my Whirlpool Washer that needed the top panel and lid replaced due to rust and paint peeling off. This was a difficult job for anyone except Jeremy. The washer looks brand new and my wife and I are very pleased. Honesty, expert repair and a fair price!!!</Review>

👏👏👏👏
Week 1/2 without a washer and 'JOSH' with Oak Valley Appliance was not letting snow get in his way!! 😁😁😁😁 Very grateful for his dedication! Can not say Thank you enough! ❄☃️😁😇🤗

And he had to walk BACK up the hill... IN the snow! I can vouch... wasn't barefoot, for the stories he tells HIS kids later! ❤🤣😂🤣😂

They are on 🔥 with their dedicated service!<//Text>< userid>

Oak Valley Appliance is very efficient and friendly.  We have had their technician Josh out on a few different occasions and he is always on time, very friendly and beyond helpful and knowledgeable!  I have never had this level of customer service with any other repair company.  We will for sure use Oak Valley for all future repairs!</review>

Rep was courteous, informative, and highly professional. I was kept well informed throughout the entire process, and was even given a courtesy call 15 minutes prior to the reps arrival. It’s comforting to know that there are still companies/individuals who value courtesy, and professionalism. Highly satisfied!!!<//review>

This company support our military/veterans, our technician Jeremy was very well mannered and knowledgable of the dryer brand we have. He was able to fix the issue that turned out to be just a loose connection. We had him clean the dryer, boy did it need it. We have two dogs so I was there blankets twice a week. Ask for him.< /text>

Jeremy quickly focused on swollen capacitors on the main CB of a warm GE refrigerator. Honest and professional, returned with new CB in 2 days, and problem fixed.

<Text>So my dishwasher wasn't draining and I have been on the phone with plumbers and appliance repair places for hours. When I called Oak Valley they were helpful and sent me to a technician named Jeremy who helped walk me through repairing the issue. He was kind and walked me through it now I have a working dishwasher and a place for my appliances in the future.< /Text>< date>

Josh was excellent and super helpful with our broken washer. He knew immediately what the problem was and quoted me with the price of the part. I told him that I didn't want to fix the washer and he gave me recommended places to by our new washer. He was super friendly and helpful. I was very impressed with Josh's customer service.</review>

<Review>Mike showed up very soon after the reminder call. He was very friendly efficient and patient.  He explained  what we had to do and helped us to do a lot of things on our own instead of just saying something needed to be replaced to make a buck. The parts that did need replaced were at a reasonable cost for the parts and labor. We always use Oak Valley Appliance! Thank you for providing excellent service!!</Review>< pics>

<name>Karen Waugh<//name><review>I dreaded calling for warranty service on our washing machine because of the horrible stories I’ve heard from others about trying to get their appliances fixed. Lowe’s has done a really smart thing by using Oak Valley Appliance for its warranty service calls! From start to finish they are the most professional, efficient and friendly company I have ever dealt with! Josh...who is very knowledgeable in his field...did an amazing job fixing my washer. I am recommending Oak Valley Appliance to everyone I know!<//review>< resp>

This company is outstanding and I highly recommend them. Oak Valley Inc clearly has high expectations of their employees, and  it shows in everything they do from their outstanding customer service to their technician’s knowledge and technical skills

The technician they sent to my house
named Jeremy D was extremely professional, knew his job very well,  and was one of the most likable people I have met in a very long time

He represents his company very well and in my opinion management should strongly consider promoting him to a management position

Other businesses could learn a lot from this company and how well run it is

Thanks for assisting us and we will absolutely call in the future

Just needed a simple double check I installed my gas dryer proper day of delivery as I smelled gas. They were kindly able to squeeze me in for an appointment day of. Technician Jeremy showed up and was friendly & demonstrated top tier customer service and also explained to me a bit about how the inside of dryers work. A bit more expensive service than a standard handy man but I had no issue paying due to their customer service and willingness to show up last minute on a Friday.<//review>

This is by far the best appliance repair company I've ever used.  Very prompt, let you know approx time of arrival.  They let you know where you are on their appointment list for the day.  Nice thing is they explain everything, and all the options upfront.</Text>

<review>The service on our new LG range was done by a bright, friendly, knowledgable and efficient technician named Mike.  He showed respect for our home while he did his work in a quick and clean manner. A couple of additional pluses were: he serviced our appliance one day after I called for an appointment and the cost was minimal!< /review>< name>

Josh was my technician who fixed my dishwasher. He was quick with the service and happy to explain what was going on. It definitely was less expensive than having to purchase a whole new appliance. I’d use Oak Valley again!</review>

Jeremy is an excellent technician he was very knowledgeable regarding the appliances that he was repairing. After the intial visit he kept us informed of the status of our repair and when the parts came in he called to see when we were available. We have never had anyone come to our house to do any work that was so professional. Because of covid-19 we did not have to ask him to put on PPE like other techs that came to our house. Kudos to Oak Valley Appliances for having a great emlpoyee work for you.< /review>

Very prompt callback once home warranty claim was received by them. Person on phone listened to and understood our concerns. Tech Jeremy was friendly and efficient. He explained the problems with the washer. The best thing...he had the parts with him! Other times with different repair companies parts had to be ordered which delayed the repair. Thank you Oak Valley Appliance!<//Review>

Josh with Oak Valley is an example of how employees should be. He is always working above and beyond. Very knowledgeable and punctual. I will always have my appliances serviced by Oak Valley due to the fact that they have an employee that truly cares and makes sure that we get back on track with our appliances.</Text>

After our fridge went out, I called around to find a repair shop. I called many local companies for my needs. Live in the valley for 30 years. Some companies I called we’re not completely honest with me.  One company wanted me to remove the fridge and take it in for repairs. I thought this was ridiculous and the fridge is not easy to move. When I  phoned Oak Valley for warranty work with a faulty  compressor. Their service was very professional. There was no removal of our refrigerator for repairs. It was repaired in home by Josh.  One of the local companies wanted $400 of upfront money. They said we would get our money reimbursed to us if the refrigerator was covered under LG’s warranty. Oak Valley  required no money upfront. Oak Valley made it in an easy choice thank you. They now have our future business😊</Review>

Jeremy came twice, once to diagnose the problem and once to fix it. He was very professional and explained in details what was the problem. We were very appreciative of his knowledge, timeliness and professionalism. The second time he came with Josh and they were both professional. They worked quickly and solved the problem.

Highest rating of 5 gold stars applies to Oak Valley Appliance in Tehachapi, California on every level for their excellent customer service!

We were having trouble with our washer, which is rough with a family of 6. Jermey came out and looked at it. We needed a new agitator. The part was ordered and fixed with in 2 days!!! Jermey explained everything to me and was very professional. If anything happens in our home again I will know who to call.</review>

Josh came and assist my concerns of my double oven. Josh asked me some simple questions that helped him problem shoot my concerns. Josh discovered that the lower and upper igniters where not working, I expected that the parts would have to be order and take weeks to come in. Josh came back inside with parts, installed them and my double oven is back up and running just in time for Thanksgiving.
Thanks to Josh and Oak Valley Appliances for the help..< /Review>
