You should take the time to practice customer service skills as well as possibly re-learn how to have a conversation.

As a patient trying to communicate with you was not easy. I had to break down and literally tell you to give me a minute to speak without you speaking over me.
I felt that was not only rude but made it unclear as to what my options for treatment.

If I didn’t call back today, I would not have found the information that helped me when I called today.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I had to wait a few days before I left a review I’m still upset. First of all they allowed some person to give authorization for my son to have a filling which also means they needed to give him something to numb his mouth. They spoke to allowed him to sign a consent form and did work on my son’s mouth and after they were done asked me for consent. The doctor then came out and told me I was informed because I signed again they spoke to someone else and allowed him to sign not to mention we are African American. I’m still upset and they need a more diverse staff. I can go on but since I have to work and I protect my peace and space I’ll stop.And since COVID they should be more careful.< /Text>

This is the best dentist and office I've ever been too. They are fair in pricing and work with you if you don't have enough money. The customer service is excellent, when it comes to billing the spell it out all for ya without missing a beat. You know exactly what is being done and how much it cost.< /text>

<Text>It was not a good experience. The problem star in the waiting room, people complaining about the bill and miscommunication. I make an appointment for check up and cleaning and the doctor recommendation was to have a deep cleaning that require antibiotics, I never heard smoothing like that, l don't see necessary. They took more that 20 xray, they don't have updated equipment, I was concern about that.</Text><rating>1</rating>< time>

I have had everything done from twice-a-year cleaning to a new crown replacement.  The Tech staff, Dental Assistants, and Dentists are first-rate.  Making appointments is easy and I have yet to really wait in the waiting room for my scheduled appointment.  The Office Staff is very good as is their communication for appointments.  The Dental staff are friendly and very competent.  My Dentist is excellent.  Her manner and work is some of the best I have ever had.

< Review>
I am really happy with Bright Now Dental in Lone Tree specially with their Hygenist Miss Barbara (smooth and professional) and desk team Miss Joy.  They accept almost all insurance. The main thing that really got me with them is that they are honest and they don't try to rip you off with unnecessary spending.  They don't try to make money out of you and come up with things that will make spend money on compare to other Dental places.    My wife and I was most impressed with their selection of good Hygenist that really care about helping.  Also, they some other Dental places requires you do many things before they would do cleaning on you, spend on this and spend on that before they do cleaning. Thank you Ms. Barbara and Joy, we hope to be working with you for a while.< /Review>

The worst service!
I went in for a cleaning.
The place was empty.
After my x-rays and visit with the dentist, she asked me to wait in the waiting room until the hygienist was ready to take me back for my teeth cleaning. After 30 minutes of waiting, the receptionist asked why I was still here. I explained and she went to find answers. She returned and explained they all went to lunch and asked if I would come back in one and a half hours later!?!?!
Left to never to return.
Maybe she didn't like that I wouldn't pay $1,000 (out-of-pocket) for a filling and crown until I got a second opinion.< /Text>

<review>Very interesting as I read through the reviews.  I have been coming to this dental office for at least a couple of years.  Like everywhere some days are more busy than others so they staff may not seem as chatty.  I am okay with this as sometimes I am the one waiting and I wouldn’t want to wait longer than necessary just so everyone can feel like they received enough attention.  I travel a lot so the staff does everything they can to work around my hectic flight plans.  They will even work to squeeze me in if necessary.  As to the service I have always felt well taken care of while visiting.  My wait time has been minimal compared to other dentist locations.  I also feel like when I am in the chair I am always given options to my care, bottom line its my teeth.  I have always been presented with the cost (requiring my signature) before I get a procedure done.  I understand the deep cleaning is a pain in the butt and expensive, but even for that I was given an option.</review>< Pics>

Went in to get my all 4 of my wisdom teeth extracted on a Wednesday. The surgeon numbed my entire mouth, when I asked if I could swallow the surgeon started he would turn the suction on and would suction the saliva. That’s when the surgeon who was already 10-15 min late walking into the office for my appointment realized that the suction machine in the entire office didn’t work. The office manager then stated that it had stopped working the day before but had gotten “fixed”. I understand that machines break down, what I am totally not okay with is the negligence the office manager had by not checking the machine when she walked in on Wed morning. I was sent home that day with my entire mouth completely numb and a two page list of other surgeons to call to see if I could get an appointment within that week as I had ready requested time off work. Fortunately a completely different office/company was able to fit me into there schedule for the following day. Before leaving this place I was told to disregard a bill I would be getting in the mail for $11, I received a bill late February which was disregarded. Mid March and I received a second notice for the same bill I was told to “disregard”. Not only are they negligent but they don’t stick to their word after making a huge mistake.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The cleaning went great once they actually get started. EVERY TIME I have an appointment they don’t start anything till at least 45 minutes from your appointment start time. Yesterday they didn’t call our name to go back until 30 minutes after my appointment start time. The time before that, they brought us back 30 minutes after our appointment time to sit in the dental chairs and an hour went by and no one had started my cleaning, I had other appointments to go to so I left without my cleaning. So make sure you leave yourself plenty of time because your 30 minute cleaning could not be finished for 2 hours after your appointment time.<//review>

The Administration staff at the front desk was great   had to wait almost an hour after appointment time the female doctor what  was all about the dollar wanted to do some extensive work costing thousands I was not interested at the time just wanted a basic cleaning she refused to clean my teeth said I needed a deep cleaning and basic cleaning was not an option. I am 65 years old had deep cleaning before I know when my teeth are in a state of emergency for deep cleaning that was not the case I was rushed out of the office because she said it was lunch time if I was interested in the deep cleaning I can come back after lunch time very very rude doctor money money money was all she was interested in</Text>

<Review>I tried to give them a chance. Was seen about 30 minutes after my appointment time. I have a tooth that is pretty much beyond saving. Instead of talking about an extraction and bridge, the Dr. wanted to do a number of extensive procedures and if that didn't work they could always go back and do an extraction and bridge. I understand wanting to save a tooth, but at some point it just makes no sense. While it's not fraud -- it is very unethical and all about milking you for you what ever they can. I'm actually still waiting [2 weeks now] for a call back with the final cost information, was supposed to be called back the next day and wasn't. I would rather use my old dentist [that doesn't accept my insurance], than work with this place that will take my insurance.<//Review>< pics>

I have  nothing but good things to say about this office. The Doctor explains everything clearly and is very gentle and does excellent work. I am a nervous wreck and she was very patient with me . She fixed all the horrible work done by my previous dentist but never once said anything negative about him. She earned my respect with her high ethical standards and professionalism. I will be referring my friends and family to her.< /Text>

Earlier this year I took my son in for a standard cleaning -  Day of visit he received x rays, never saw the doctor and the cleaning techs were so far behind he never got his teeth cleaned as it was now over a 2-hour wait in the chair and he needed to get to work in SF.  We were told that a technician called in sick and they were behind. He moved out of the country and never went back for the cleaning.

Fast forward to this month.  I schedule my first visit with the call center – hoping this visit will be better.  I take time off for work (late afternoon so I don’t miss much time), get to my appt with plenty of time to spare (paperwork completed to turn in).

First - the tech who took my x-rays did not seem to care about her job.  Second-The doctor checks my teeth tells me I need a filling and then says they cannot do the cleaning because it’s now too late in the day and there is someone else waiting to have their teeth cleaned and can we schedule another time.  I express my dissatisfaction because my time is valuable also and I specifically scheduled a cleaning with their call center.  They say they can try to squeeze me in on Saturday.  Strike 2.

If I could give this company a “0” I would.  Seriously, who schedules a cleaning with a dentist and the dentist office not be prepared to provide the service.  Two times in a row?  Bad planning on their part to provide for their patients.  I won't go back.</text>

Love this office! The front staff worked hard last December to provide good service and be super helpful. This spring the office and professional dental staff did a fabulous job with me. My teeth, my emotions, my finances, my schedule and my worries... everything! I'm a hard sell and I really LOVE this office. The services are great, the staff is professional and my teeth are happy!</review>

My AARP dental insurance led me here. Very good care and nice staff. Just wish they had name badges to make it more personal. Hard to remember names when visits are so far between.

The facility is spotless and they use state-of-the-art technology!< /review>

I ended up going to a different dentist for a second opinion after coming here because the dentist (here) told me I have an issue with my gum and needed an especial treatment and I need to pay out-of-pocket for anesthetic.  I was surprised when she said that so I seek a second opinion.  After getting the second opinion, it appears that my gum is healthy and no issues.  I do NOT recommend this dentist..< /text>

They are always very gentle with me and considerate to my needs.  They go above and beyond. My dentist is helping me getting over my fear of being in her chair. I've gone from crying hysterically every time because of being traumatized by Western Dental when they left a file in my mouth and caused me extreme pain, but not at Bright Now Dental. They always make sure I'm comfortable and I so appreciate them😘😘😘< /Text>

Oh my goodness how do I count the ways how wonderful Bright Now! Dental is!!!!! The front desk staff---- "especially JOY" was so accommodating, and friendly faces soak up the room 😄I am an old lady and have seen some dentist in my lifetime, huge kudos to Dr. Ebrahimi...probably the greatest dentist I have seen. Awesome bedside manner and he explains everything he does to make you feel comfortable. Please stay wonderful!!!!<//Text>

i have recieved the best care. I had broke off my front crown on a thurs afternoon and was leaving fri early on vacation. I called and they got me in that same day and gave me a temporary fix until i could come back the following week. When i went in that following week, not only did they fixed my broken tooth but worked with me financially to be able to fix my whole smile. I have had the best experience with Dr. Thampy she is kind and very patient. I am a patient for life.</Review>

I was skeptical at first with their pricing until I compared them to others.  My wife had her braces done for half the price our friends paid on getting theirs.  They are also up to date with technologies they use on their clinics.  Everyone is professional and actually care for our dental health.  They always gave us options that works for us best.  They listen and takes their time until we are sure we are satisfied!! I highly recommend Brightnow Dental in Antioch!! They made us feel welcome. Thank Antioch Brightnow Dental Team!!

Jaw was sore for coupl days after because of how rough he was . Worst dentist I have ever ben too and they didn’t say a thing about him chipping my tooth I didn’t even get a free cleaning after spending all that money . Horrible dentist< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This dentist's office is NOT efficient. I wove a crown in tracy's office and I stopped calling them that if they could wear it again, it is the same company that did my job before. They didn't want to do it. Do not spend your money with Dr who does not want to greet people and they are not cheap to say that money will be saved. NOT RECOMMENDING IT.

(Original)
Esta officiana de dentists NO es efficiente me hise una corona en la officina de tracy y se me callo los llame que si podian ponermela otra vez pues es la misma compania que me hiso el trabajo anteriormente NO quisieron haserla . No gaste su dinero con Dr que no quieren halludar a la gente y no son Baratos para desir que se ahorrara dinero. NO LA RECOMIENDO.<//Text>< pics>

< review>
This is the second time I’ve taken my 2013 Audi A6 to Hal.  They have done an outstanding job both times.  Hal and his crew care about their customers, and are extremely knowledgeable on foreign cars.  I find it refreshing to have found a dependable, honest mechanic who is truly looking out for their customer’s best interest and are reasonably priced.</review>

<Review>I took my Audi in because my check engine light came on. Hal and the technician found the problem and took care of it. I will definitely take my car back, if it were to need any other repair services. This is a very welcoming place of business that goes the extra mile.<//Review><response>{'time': 1628818333849, 'text': 'Thank you so very much Charlona for the kind review!

First time in and I was only there for tire replacement, but the experience has made me a fan. Owner explained the entire process, including many things I never knew about alignment and balance. He asked how we found them, assured me they were not just about German cars, and was just a great guy. Price was competitive too. I will be back!<//text>< Pictures>

Hal personally does all tire installation and wheel balancing; he has the best equipment, and he knows what he's doing. Extras like coating surfaces with copper lubricant and hand torqueing everything to spec are standard. I have expensive alloy rims, and wouldn't trust them to anyone else.<//Text>

Hal is my local “go to guy” for independent BMW service. He’s extremely knowledgeable and a bit of a perfectionist. Perfect! I’ve brought my vintage 1973 BMW as well as modern BMW’s, plus a VW with Bosch fuel injection issues. I especially appreciate his shop’s skill at preventing problems before they develop.</text>

Shout out to Hal, Nick and Tiffany for their work on my 2010 Carrera 4S.
Upped my performance significantly, put me back on the road quickly and thoroughly explained all the repairs.< /Review>

< Review>
We had a very good experience when we brought our 2016 Cayenne in for a oil change. Nick the technician was exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable in all aspects and the owner Hal helped out with an issue I had with the car parts store. Overall very enjoyable experience.

Hal is awesome!!!  I had him survey a BMW for me before purchasing and he was extremely thorough.  He takes his time with the vehicle, truly understands every aspect of it, and impressed the owners of the vehicle with his knowledge as well.  We all benefited from his knowledge and this experience.  Hal took the time to describe the maintenance issues and needs in detail and was more than fair on price.  I would highly recommend him for all of your vehicle needs.  Keep up the great work Hal!<//Review>

Hal is a wonderful and down to earth mechanical guy. Steve worked on my 2005 Acura RL did a wonderful job. The car has over 141,000 miles. I wanted to replace all 4 brake pads and flush all the brake fluid lines. Hal helped me to pick the best Bosch ceramics brake pads. Steve checked the car from top to bottom and asked me a lot of relevant questions. ... I picked up my car at the end of the day. She drives beautifully and performs significantly better. I appreciate the difference. Love it. The charge was very reasonable for an honest day of work. Thnx, Hal and Steve.< /text>

< review>
I have a 2008, 535 with 75k miles.
I had the car serviced at the local dealer while it was under warranty, but that is now over.
I had a 'check engine' light on and brought it to the dealer. They thought they diagnosed it and changed a part, but that did not work so they put my old part back in (but did not charge me for this, other than the diagnosis fee).
They said the repair needed now is a carbon cleaning ($800) and replace the fuel injector. They also said they cannot replace one injector, but instead have to replace all of them even if only one is causing a problem, and this was going to be $2200.
Instead, I brought the car to Hal, at Bavarian Performance, and he did their carbon cleaning for half the dealer price. Hal also was skeptical of the need for injectors so certainly suggested not replacing those.
Result?  The car is running sweet again!
My car will be going back to Hal, when something is needed.<//review>

I had a self-induced problem with the electronics of my new 2012 BMW 535 M-Sport.  I went to Bavarian Performance Specialists and met Hal, the owner, and explained what had happened.  I had several fault codes that need to be cleared and a module that needed to be reprogramed.  Hal took his time and explained what he was going to do in an attempt to fix what I had messed up.  While I waited for Hal to complete his work I had an opportunity to watch his interaction with his customers and his employees.  I found him to not only to be extremely knowledgeable, but also very professional.  He knows BMWs and knows how to treat people, whether they are customers or employees.  In the end he fixed my car without issue and in short order.  I will be back.  Finding an honest, knowledgeable and professional mechanic is not an easy task.  I highly recommend this shop to anyone with a BMW that is looking for an independent shop.< /text>

< Review>
They were simple to work with because they were cheap, straightforward, and concise. The price is always reasonable for the excellent work done on my car. My compressor was serviced by two technicians and a pump attendant who did an excellent job. They seemed genuinely interested in my plans. I value and respect their points of view.< /Review>

<review>This was a typical gas station in a very nice busy area.  The convenient store inside was well stocked with an assortment of items. The restroom is kept locked.  I was happy to find it soon after getting through the mountains on a low tank.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The gas was fine. But the car wash was terrible. The washing machine stopped working and instructed me to move out when my car was still full of foam. It didn't wash at all! Bad experience, and the guy in the convenient store had bad attitude when I reflect this terrible car wash machine issue.</Review>

<text>These guys are awesome. Fast, Friendly, and Informed. 5 Stars. Alenjandro C. and Alejandro S. worked with me and they were incredible.

My car had some catastrophic engine failures in Joshua Tree - the transmission was slipping like crazy - barely made it out.

Long story short, I brought my car to Jiffy Lube, and they got it in right away. I stayed in my car while they worked on it - very COVID friendly procedures.

They changed out my transmission fluid and that did enough of the trick to get me home to get my car properly fixed.

Thanks for keeping me on the road!

I was on my way to Santa Ana when my check engine light came on. Luckily I was able to make it to this location in time. I was out of oil completely and low on coolant. Robert and Romeo were so helpful. They gave me enough to get home safe. Incredible service and such amazing guys!< /review>

As a single mom always in a hurry it's hard to find the time for car care. My car is at 100k so my car was in desperate need of maintenance. I went in an hour before closing and Roberto said he can help me. I was in and out within and hour and feel confident that I received the best service possible. I feel like I'm driving a brand new car. Roberto was professional and courteous, I will be returning for future services.<//Text>

Jiffy lube in coachella ca. Has been by far the best place for any of my vehicle needs great deals and i have no words to describe their wonderful service. Every single employee there greets u with a great smile personality and they have the answers to all ur questions. If there were more stars to rate them with i would. I highly recommend them anytime anywhere.< /review>

Extremely poor, crappy , and bad customer service, fails to attend customers waiting in lobby efficiently. Don't perform tire rotations, brake pad changes and many other things other Jiffy Lube locations provide. Only Oil change and even that ... they do pathetically.< /Text>

There is no need to flood bad reviews with fake ones. If you look at the history of reviews when a person who does not know what they are doing walks in their oil change ends up being 140$. Just stop that practice and that's the only response that is needed.</Text>

I had a wonderful experience and I highly recommended giving this place a try. The waffles are amazing quality and taste delicious! I always come here for a snack when walking through the mall. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful if you have any questions.< /review>

<review>Fun spot for coffee!! Limited outdoor seating but inside the train is fun to enjoy coffee. I ordered the Aztec Mocha. It was sweet and spicy. Delish. The bastistia was polite. Definitely recommend stopping by, not very many places this unique to enjoy a cup of Joe.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPugM18PqM9xDYUUhUHnrcTmicpNWaVlBjaSdFw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx9gOlRGwpgIP8J4Zky6-GPvMp_iYNsFaVRBLj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

Still my favorite cafe to visit in town. Good music and a great atmosphere. They source Insight coffee and the baristas are able to whip up whatever's you like (see spicy latte below). The coffee is done via French press (last I checked) so be prepared for a little bite, but having visited their roaster's location back in Sacramento, I'm glad to say these fine folks do great job!</Text>

<review>Only downside of this place is the fact that homeless people come in and bother the business. If it was located in the downtown area or remote area, it would be nicer for them to run the business. I don't go here anymore because of this issue. I am going to Cafe for the relax time not for smelling the odor of the homeless people.< /review><gmap_id>0x808327ae15fb5403:0x1efd698d67ef8b1d<//gmap_id>< Rating>

Cozy little cafe inside an old train track. Tables and other interior is redone to be comfortable. They have free WiFi and a power outlet at every table.</review>

1- The place is so nice, cute, and creative !! a small train with simple and cute decoration inside, very quiet and relaxing for a beautiful morning :)

2- honestly the coffee is the best I've had in Chico.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<date>1512591844120< /date><review>Great, intimate space to do work. The coffee shop is small and located inside a converted train car, so it's not great for groups, but perfect for working alone or with a partner. There is always great music playing and local art displayed and for sale. Everyone's super chill and seems happy to be there.

The Aztec mocha is fantastic, and I recommend it blended.

PROS:
--Good selection of drinks with some space-specfic specialties
--Lots of natural lighting
--Showcases local artists on a rotating basis;  can purchase the art
--Small enough place that you can develop a good relationship with the baristas if you come regularly enough
--Board games

CONS:
--They use sweetened condensed milk in their blended drinks, which I hadn't been told about as I had been ordering mine with soy. Luckily I don't have an allergy, but make sure to ask for it without it.
--Limited seating. It's a small space, and the train car seating, while in theme, can be limiting if one person takes a table for 4. I've heard of people asking to share when crowded
--You can feel the place shake. Probably not noticeable for most, but if you're sensitive to motions, it is there
--There's a constant whirring of the AC/heating unit. Again, if you're not sensitive to noise, you probably won't notice it, but it drives me crazy<//review><UserId.>111176201251067190462</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>Favorite coffeeshop in town. Closes earlier (3pm during summer) but super chill with tasty coffee and other drinks. Also has art gallery right next door! Where else can you sit in a repurposed train car and drink speciality coffee?<//review>< Pics>

EMPIRE COFFEE is the best coffee place in Chico, California. You don't have to worry about hipsters talking too loud or bugging the crap out of you. Empire is legit. Get yourself a tea or coffee. The staff is friendly and will give you a hug if you ask. I would get a matcha or a white mocha. They have a huge selection of teas. Yum. Good job EC!< /text>

<review>I had the Chai - Cha: chai tea and matcha tea on ice. Tasty and refreshing, it was a totally excellent drink for a hot day. The shop benefits the Art Center, so it's a worthy cause. Plus there's no parking fees, since the train car is posted at the Amtrak station, away from  downtown.< /review>< name>

It's like if Wes Anderson made a coffee shop inside a vintage train car, and they also had delicious almond milk iced chai matcha lattes.</text>

<review>Very clean place, small and gets a bit crowded sometimes as the hallways are a little tight when people are putting clothes in but it's very worth it. I love how clean the place is and nice the people attending are very helpful. The machines are wonderful they have a prewash that I love as my husbands work clothes gets really clean. I've gone to other laundromats and actually have lost money as the machines dont wash good. These machines dont have that problem and are very affordable and spacious. The dryers are also really good by clothes doesnt get tangled up in there as it happens with other dryers, probably due to the fact they have "reversing dryers".< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0eGGwA5ExGdIwzZVzfDD-vWK9zW9MkjD8PIGj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEwFE8D3x5W0MaE6_rh6jV2J3sTJyowp_Mh9J4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt_Ha_giV0mBGX-EH6mkeX_uVTG05KcfnWAwlu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

The new owners have really fixed this place up! It has new tiles, new nice/big bathroom, it is newly painted, and they have wifi now! It is definitely one of the nicest laundromats around here!</Text>

Machines ate my money. No one is here to ask for money back. Parking is limited. Don’t know if it’s Cali prices, but machines are EXPENSIVE! 1 load is $2.00 and to dry is 25 cents/8 minutes.< /review>

Phenomenal as always!!! My technician is Tejal whom I've been letting thread my brows for roughly 5 years. Her demeanor is always so very sweet always professional. She will always ask you how you like your brows and cater to your request. Some places go in and assume your brows should look a certain way to their liking. I highly reccommend Ziba to anyone who wants gorgeous brows!!!!

Not to forget the front staff. They are always on their A game and greet every patron with a smile and professionalism<//text>

I absolutely love Ziba Beauty and the staff. I've been to many locations and this one doesn't beat any other location. The ladies that thread are nice and very experienced. One of my favorite ladies is Sabita. Sabita is really experienced and is my absolute favorite. I have small eyebrows and she always makes them look amazing. I highly recommend coming to this Ziba location :) !</text>

<Review>This place really deserves no stars!!! I have wonderful thick eyebrows, and i went in for a clean up.. i know when someone is taking too much off and will always stop them.. i told the threader to stop and she refused to listen, she kept telling me she needed to fix it.. I literally had to push her away, and when i looked at my left eyebrow a chunk off the top of my brow was gone.. It's been two months it won't grow back.. I'm so mad and nothing can be done!!! I still had to pay and everything. My eyebrows are now never the same!!!</Review>< rating>

I went here for the first time and I wasn't satisfied with my eyebrows after seeing them without the pencil. I usually go to another location and wanted to come here since it's closer. I won't be returning and I should get my money back.<//Text>

I will make sure Jonathan hears about the great work he did.'}<//Resp><Review>I want to praise Jonathan for the quality of his work and for going beyond the call of duty.  A week or so after he performed HVAC maintenance, there was a power failure and the unit would not turn on. On his day off, he called me and helped me figure out what the problem was.   He interpreted pictures of what I saw and video of the LED flashing diagnostics. This was urgent because we were leaving town and we needed the system working before we left (we have cats). Also, before this happened, he's the first to point out that our attic unit needed a surge protector. If I had gotten one when he suggested that, the problem may never have happened.  So high praise for Jonathan!</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><gmap_id>0x80dcaa6b7a2d17ff:0xea0ad128c68986cf<//gmap_id></record>

They were 100% transparent with what to expect from their assessment of our issue. Our technician (probably the best vendor we’ve ever had at our home over the past 17 years) showed me in real-time what he was looking for as he performed tests and how that result would impact decision-making going forward. I felt like I could trust him, his assessment and recommendations and that he did everything he could to keep costs down.  He went over and above by sweeping out my garage as he waited for our water heater to drain. I’m very grateful for our technician, Justin, and for Redlands/Henry Bush Plumbing for finding him.< /review>

Service techs are always friendly and helpful. Redlands & Bush plumbing and heating/air conditioning has done quite a few things at our residence, and no matter whether the project is big or small they've always done a terrific job.<//Review>

Rudy was awesome, super professional and friendly as well. He respected our covid space and adhered to all the protocols. He unclogged the kitchen sink easily and cleaned up all afterward. He also showed me some tricks of the trade for unclogging a bathroom sink. We will definitely request Rudy for any future plumbing issues!</Text>

Tim and Jonathan came out to service the hot water heater that wasn’t turning on. They were very helpful in explaining to me why it wasn’t working and they were able to fix it for me. Jasmine who works in the office is amazing too. All around great experience working with this company< /text>

This company offers competitive rates for their jobs. However, the management does not value their employees and this results in less than quality performances in the field. Would recommend to check out some other local companies before settling for these guys.< /review>

Randy Krigbaum installed a high end garbage disposal in our home for us.  He has done several plumbing  services for us during the past four years.  He does excellent work and is very knowledgeable!  Also he has a very pleasant personality.  I have been very pleased with Redlands . Henry Bush, and will continue my association with them.</Review>

After having a couple of really terrible leak/overflow situations, we had Redlands Plumbing re-pipe our entire turn-of-the-century home. They were prompt, fast and professional, and the job was done with minimal inconvenience to us. It is a giant relief not to have to worry about that any more! Heartily recommend!</text>

<review>My initial experience with Redlands was positive, the technician was very friendly and helpful.  The size of the bill ($1,046 was much more than I expected for the replacement of a valve, but when you need service right now, you understand that it will end up costing more.  He explained to us that the problem was a valve, which required him to go back down the mountain to get the part and involved an additional charge for the back-and-forth.  The furnace worked fine that day and to my knowledge, for another 5 days.  Yesterday, however, there was no heat and when I called Redlands Plumbing to come back, I was told that because of winter road conditions they would not allow their trucks back up the mountain.  Although I understand winter conditions, I am sure they also understand people freezing all night long because of a furnace not working.  As Redlands was unable to tell me when they would be able to return (as weather conditions are not predictable), I had to find another heating professional to come early this morning.
Without telling him what the Redlands tech found, he explained to me the problem EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE REDLANDS TECH THE PRIOR WEEK.  As if nothing had been done to remedy the problem although I know I paid through the nose for the valve and labor the previous week.  In addition he found water leaking into the bottom of the furnace (Redlands had said it was basic condensation, but this was more than simple condensation) because the secondary heat exchanger was cracked.  Also because of this, the blower motor was blowing the wrong way, failing to ignite the gas, and thus there was no heat.  When I asked him about replacing the secondary heat exchanger, he suggested that having spent over $1,000 the previous week, and a couple hundred today, it was just going to continue to have problems because of the age and it would be better just to replace the furnace now and avoid the additional thousands of dollars going forward.
As I said at the beginning of this note, the technician who came to my house was friendly, intelligent and service oriented, but he must have missed a serious issue or perhaps the secondary heat exchanger cracked after he left.  I am unable to say which is the case, but the fact is, I wasted over $1,000 last week, almost $200 today (curious how much difference the pricing between the 2 different HVAC companies, right?) and now I have to replace the furnace - which should have been an option last week, ethically speaking.  That is one mark against Redlands I will share with friends and neighbors.
But the most galling point is the fact that having "fixed" the system, and discovering there was no fix at all but the same issue one week later, Redlands felt no responsibility to come back quickly and fix the problem of a cold house and the people freezing inside it and cannot give me even an estimated action date.  That is the bad taste that will remain in my memory a long time.  I intend to contact the billing department to get an adjustment to that huge - wasted - billing amount.  And I will update this note afterwards with my results.<//review>< Name>

They did multiple repairs at my premises. The work was consisted of: repair and adjusting the water pressure repair the dishwasher, repair the flush tank. They did a thorough and very professional job. I will for sure call them for my next work and would recommend them to all my friends and family members.</Review>

<Text>I was doing a DIY shower valve and steel pipe replacement in my house. The valve was a older one and both Home Depot and Lowes did not have it as regular stock. After going to 2 other local plumbing shops they recommended me to Redlands plumbing. I'm so glad they did. Don working the counter saved me 140 dollars on a replacement and had all the parts and he cleaned it out and rebuilt in front of me for 38 dollars. He also custom cut and threaded a steel pipe fitting for me. Don is a old school honest plumber that is hard to find today. I recommend these guys for any plumbing you need done right the first time.</Text></record>

The team did a fantastic job installing a new HVAC in the basement of my home. They disconnected the vents from the basement to the second story so the new unit provides heat and A/C only to the downstairs. Now I have two independent zones in the house and it is much easier to heat and cool. The installers were very professional and cleaned up the job site at the end of each day. Great job!< /Review>

They were professional and honest and so patient with this nervous new home owner.

<review>I had a guy come over and gave me an estimate to replace my outdoor unit. After I found that I was given an estimate for a 3 ton ac while my existing ac was 5 ton, I tried multiple times to get in touch with the guy and also called customer service. Each time they took my information but no one ever contacted me. Finally, after 2 weeks I get in touch with the guy who gave me the estimate only to find out he is out on vacation. I call customer service and request to discuss the matter with a manager. Again all information is taken from me and nobody contacts me for another 2 days. I call them again and again the same story, they have no record of my previous conversations and this time I am told that I have to call early morning if I want to get in touch with a manager.

This review has been edited after additional interaction with Redlands & Henry Bush Plumbing. I wasn't happy with the initial install of our new AC (it wouldn't turn on after the installers left), but the company was very responsive and addressed all of the issues we had in a timely and friendly manner. WOULD recommend, and WOULD do business with again.</Review>

After looking into this matter we discovered that the rebate program that was recommended to you had run out of funding. We regularly monitor the availability of funds for these programs but it seems that the program ran out of funds abruptly.  We apologize for this but it is beyond our control. However, in an effort to make things right for you we will be mailing you a $500 check in lieu of the rebate. We want you to know that we truly appreciate you for choosing us to install your HVAC system. Our customers' satisfaction is very important to us. Thank you. (Update) Mr Rodriguez, we are happy that we were able to resolve the problem for you. We also appreciate the updated review. If you need anything let us know."}<//Resp>
<Text>I Love my New A/C and that Ken did such a great job.
I recommend Redlands  Plumbing to anyone looking for a New A/C or service. Thank you very much for a great job Ken.

I had a problem with the billing of my New A/C system but Mrs Mauer ( sorry if I misspelled your name) took care of the issue. Alls well that ends well.
Thank you very much. I really appreciate all your hard work in dealing with this matter.< /Text>< user>

Ian figured out the problem in less than 10 minutes but it was a biggie😩. I expected it to be a lot of money, but they stood by their warranty and Ian had us back and running in no time...best part no money out of pocket...YAY.👍🏼👍🏼...it’s so nice to know they stand by their products. And Ian was the best, I will be asking for him from now on...Thanks<//Review>< Name>

<review>Both visit was great from Christian. He was very professional, well mannered and quick job both times. He explained clearly what he was doing as well as what was needed to be done in the future to maintain our heater/ air-conditioner. He was great while he was here working on our unit.
The only complaint I have was his/ company's tartiness. Both time he was over 1 hour late and I had to call the company. It would be much more convenient to plan my day if the company/ or Christian call ahead of time he was running late and gave a time of how long before he could get there. I understand that a job previous us could take longer but please take consideration of your customer's time too.
Thank you and I would recommend this place to my Friends.</review>< pictures>

Had the best experience ever with this company. Just called yesterday to explain that there is condensation pouring out of the front of split system AC.  NEXT Morning the tech shows up and gets right to fixing the problem. I was just out of warranty from the install, but they still took good care of me.  Being in customer service myself, I was even taking notes as to the excellence and courtesy this firm has ALWAYS shown!!!  I can't remember the techs name but he had a pony tail! Dude is awesome and knows his stuff! Long Live Redlands & Henry Bush AC</Text>

We have a condo in Lake Arrowhead, and the upstairs bathroom sink has been giving us clogging problems for awhile, where we share a drain with the common wall neighbor. Doug from Henry Bush Plumbing was the tech that arrived, on time and ready to assist.  He had his booties to put on to keep our carpet clean.  Came in and assessed the situation, and saw what needed to be done.  Had a tricky time getting around my neighbor's drain into her unit, but was able to snake the main line several times, cleaning out the problems.  The co. even offered the use of their drain video camera for no additional charge, IF I did not need a copy.  Will use and recommend Doug and Henry Bush Plumbing anytime.  Great work.  Thanks.<//text>

Justin recently came to check our water heater.  He arrived as promised and after looking over the water heater he explained what he intended to do and what he might find and what that meant.  After he finished the work he explained what he found and suggest that we might do it again in six months because of sediment in our water supply.  He was polite and knowable.</Review>

I would recommend this company to anybody;  very professional and a very good quality and through job !  The technician, Roy, really took the time to make sure to check everything to make the proper diagnosis and even took the time to clean some of the parts! Customer  Service was excellent as well, they did schedule the repair as soon as they could right after they ordered the parts.
We are very happy with their job! Roy , the technician was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain anything we wanted to know. He really went above and beyond to do an excellent job!
As a customer I will be calling Redlands Plumbing and Air for any service.<//review>

Omg I can't say enough. First Ian was our first experience with the company. He was so thorough and checked everything. When he told us the issues with our heating unit and the cost to repair our old tired unit I was so sad. Ian was so honest and I then knew I found the right place to do business with. Honesty and such personal care was given. He then scheduled us with Chris to give us a quote on a new system. Omg he was great and thanks to both of them we got a new air and heating system. It was done with great professionalism and honesty we now have a updated quiet system.  Thank you to Redlands plumbing and heating for sending the BEST professionals ever. Customers for life<//Review>

< review>
When I made the initial call, the lady took my phone number and an alternative number. She said the tech will call when he is on his way. He did call, but to the alternate number which was my wife number. She told the tech that she was going to work ( she did not know about my arrangements with you guys). He told her 1 o’clock is ok as a replacement appointment.
Minutes later I got a call from a lady who said the tech called my number and no reply( i don’t have a missed Call). She said she can’t guarantee the 1 o’clock appointment and it will be from 12 to 5 window. I cancelled the whole thing. I was specific for her to call my number and not the alternative.
Not a good first experience. When you bend facts to get out of a situation.

Totally professional, Commercial installation performed as promised on time.  They provided a binder with all appropriate paper work and inspections and was present for the city's final inspection. Of many  a/c heating installs I have had done, this was by far the best and most professional yet!! Thanks Chris.

<review>They were very helpful with our job.  Our ducting was 20 years old and falling apart.  They do what no one else does for a reasonable cost, which is to design a new distribution layout of ducts and balance the air flow.  This is either expensive or you need a big job not just a single family dwelling.  There workers were very clean and very professional.  The air distribution is better than it ever was.  We are very happy with their service and product.  You can't go wrong.< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>Not happy with very recent, overly expensive, re-pipe job, this August 2019. Unprofessional, poorly skilled drywallers who was very argumentative and defensive about their sloppy repairs. Once we made our concerns known, they sent the same drywallers back to repair the sloppy repair...it didn't go well. This was a very stressful experience and we have not yet recovered from it...We had great Customer service in the past. We will never use them again. Will never refer them to anyone. John and Alfredo were very nice. Also, don't give written receipts/contract, only email.
Ps: re-pipe job was 20 grand!<//Review><userid>117588061323547956941<//userid><rating>1<//rating>< resp>

The techs, installation crews, sales and office staff have been helpful and professional. We have had a few bumps, as expected in a house 59+ years old, but they have worked consistently to establish our system. Our technician, Roy, has gone above and beyond to make sure everything runs well!
I will definitely be calling them for my future plumbing needs, as well as to maintain our new Carrier system.

Complete Ripoff! Could not get any sort of a ballpark figure or hourly rate from their office/service people for a simple bathroom safety bar installation and had to pay their "service fee" regardless of what the estimate is given. It's  a senior citizen version of highway robbery.
Simply appalling, stealing from our senior citizens in this manner. My surgeon charges less.

<user_name>JULIE GERLACH<//user_name><Review>Our plumber was #378 Harry Hanvey,  We had an emergency call for a busted pipe.  They are the only company that responded and came out in a couple of hours.   At first look we needed major work to gain access to the pipes.  The next day when Harry came out he had another option that he had thought about the night before, which worked and saved us half of what the previous quote was.  We appreicated the effort and thoughtfulness he gave to us in solving our problem and saved our vacation.  We would highly recommend this company and will call in the future for any work needed.  They seem to be fair and honest and that means a lot to someone on a budget.</Review></record>

<Review>Worst customer service and repair work. We have an AC unit they installed a few years ago. We are on our 4 th service call in 2 weeks and still trying to get our air conditioning fixed. Every tech that has come out has told us they are not familiar with our Carrier unit. Hmmm they installed it and they are carrier certified. WTF?? They came out today and tonight again does not work, the tech William today said it was our expensive 2 month old filter so replaced it. Never heard of a filter causing the AC unit to shut off completely, but whatever. Yet here we are again in a hot house.  Scheduling 5th visit tomorrow, can't wait to hear what they think is the cause now. DO NOT have them install anything for you and DO NOT have them in your house for repair work, they have no clue what they are doing!!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dcaa6b7a2d17ff:0xea0ad128c68986cf<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I called Redlands Plumbing and Heating when my a/c broke down over the July 4th weekend.  I spoke with Customer Service Rep Britny.  She had a wonderful attitude, and was genuinely concerned about my situation.  About an hour after calling, Technician Roy arrived at my house.  He was very friendly and courteous.  After examining my a/c, he patiently explained the problem, how he was going to fix it and the associated costs.  He was very professional and knowledgable and took great pride in his work.
I would highly recommend Redlands Plumbing and Heating.  Their customer service and quality of workmanship are outstanding.  Special thanks to Britny and Roy for doing a great job!<//Review>< Pictures>

SERVICE ONLY.. Don't be fooled when they say a/c parts 'available' at the parts counter. No a/c parts to the public that's the law, they said. Find your nearest electronics store, they have the same electrical items you'll need.<//text>

I will NEVER call them again....$220 just to replace a $5 hose bibb, after being quoted less than $50 for a service call????

And they refuse to give an estimate over the phone, and will do only when you're on site when you're cornered and have little choice.

Next time, I will call around first!  There are DOZENS of others out there!< /Review>

After just completing a kitchen and bathroom renovation with Joseph running the project, I cannot say enough good things about him. From the minute he came to my home his wealth of knowledge and ability to listen as well as communicate made for a stress free, organized and timely process that has just been amazingly easy.  He was available at all times, and the end result is better than I even hoped for. I would highly recommend Joseph to anyone and say if you are lucky enough to have him in charge of your project, it’s a gift.< /review>

<Text>First off, the manager was amazing. He knows more than anyone I spoke about remodeling and has an amazing eye. Calm, knowledgeable and respectful.
Second, the crew was fast! They were able to complete our kitchen and bathrooms on time which was very impressive. They even found us an amazing clawfoot tub!
Do not think twice. The job look like a modern hotel when it’s done.!!< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c29c477d5d010d:0x841fb9fa19199b89< /gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><user_name>bob rendon</user_name><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

I highly recommend everyone to use Prime to make your house look the way that you want .Worth every penny. I really couldn’t have been more satisfied with the work that was done by Prime.
Whenever something wasn’t right, they immediately responded and addressed it right away.
Love our new house!< /Review>

<Review>This company did an excellent job. Good quality, responsive and skilled at what they do .
In retrospect we needed four men but these three worked as hard as four. Everything is in perfect condition. They also did a great job as a front office contact. I highly recommend Prime.</Review>< user>

<text>Remodeling is stressful but the folks at Prime made it much less.
We hired Prime for our remodeling project in West Hills.
The crew was amazing!! They were always available & patient to answer any questions.
I highly recommend this contractor.
Very professional and efficient.
Thank you!!<//text>< user>

Great and professional company.
The crew from Prime helped me with a big project last month. They fixed the roof and remodeled our kitchen and bathrooms. They finished the remodel on time.
Such a great experience and highly recommend them.<//review>

So knowledgeable and detail oriented.  They knew exactly what needed to be done to stop the leak.

They were very timely, neat and took care of all the details while explaining the process.  Their quote was solid and very reasonable.< /review>

<Text>Our guest bedroom was just remodeled by Prime. We chose this company based on reviews and their bid was not the highest that we got.
Work included demo, waterproofing and tiling.
The quality of work is top notch!! The whole bathroom look amazing (they brought it into the 21st Century)
Communication was excellent the entire process.

My wife and I we're looking to add an additional bathroom to our house as well as remodeling our kitchen but were looking for a company that was able to do it all! Your Prime Contractor was able to give me a quote based on what we wanted and was able to start work shortly after we approved the estimate. Project manager  answers all of my annoying questions as well as making sure everything was done to my OCD specifications.

Overall we're really happy with the work that they provided us as well as the service that they gave us.</Text>

I recently contacted Prime for a quote I needed for remodeling the kitchen.
The whole process was smooth and had no issues. Every member of the team had good intuitions and paid attention to detail. Email and phone were easily answered!
Final results were beyond my expectations!! They even followed up with me a month after.<//text>

After we hire them it didn't take long for us to sit back and let them do their thing. We never had anyone do a big remodel job for us, just little ones in the backyard and gate work. We needed a change. after saving up some cash in the last year we didn't want to just hire anyone...
This team shined for us. They put together a solid feasible plan, very quickly got it permitted, and once construction started they just ran through it.<//text>

<text>The house needed serious renovations  !
Prime transformed my house completely in the best way possible... since they finished the hardwood floors and the kitchen cabinets I've been hosting friends and family. Everyone agreed the place looks amazing.

My kitchen was in the worse shape, cabinets falling apart and the oven door was blocked by a drawer.. they took it all out and made for me perfectly measured kitchen- love cooking now! So easy and convenient.  Prime truly care about your needs... they asked me many questions to make sure i will get what i need.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>After an exhausting search, we decided to remodel our new house with Prime Home .
Very smooth transaction, timely delivery and no surprises. Also, they did the landscaping in my backyard it came out amazing!!
. And it was a lot simpler and affordable than the two previous sales reps had bid for the same job and products.

Thanks guys,< /Text>< pictures>

My father wanted to remodel the half kitchen so it would be easier for him to access it from the living room. He needed it to be more specious and personally requested for the cabinets to be sliding so his wrist won't hurt as much. When they were done my whole family came to see it, they could not belive him when he told them he is back in the kitchen cooking!!! Everything he wanted they did for him, while keeping me in the loop. Grateful for the help and the patience you had with us and all my emails.</Review>

I booked an appointment and they started the work the next week.
Start early in the morning and they always asked for permission before entering a bed room or if they needed to use the other restroom we have. Polite and easy to work with. I had worries about the price not the work because they sounded professional. The price was fixed from the beginning so they did not add any thing later, was great .</review>

As their name indicates, they are here to improve your house. They sure did !!!
Hallway was very narrow and we wanted a good way to break it into the living room... which we also wanted to renovate. Tricky job because it is inside the house... they did fine and never made us feel uncomfortable! Gracious and quick! Was less messy than what we expected and the final results were beyond expectations!<//text>

I was very specific about the price range I was willing to stretch and Prime were great about it.
Friendly faces and attitude with a strong sense of business.
My wife and I just bought a new house and we had so many things to fix including the primary room which I use for an office, the bedroom and kitchen. I was supervising the crew most of the week but I felt like I was in good hands.
Prime took care of my wife anxiety attack when we had a leakage in the bathroom of the master bedroom. I recommend calling Prime for any big project you may have.</text>

I wanted to share how great my experience with Prime Home Improvement was!!! I felt like my house was going to be worth more than the market value after this amazing company fixed it for me .
Total remodeling and it was indeed the vision I wanted ... I will recommend any one who wants to sell their house and increase the value of the house Love prime. I am so happy with my new remodeled home.</text>

<review>I highly recommend Prime for any remodel projects!!

My new kitchen and bathroom are stunning!! Like a picture from a magazine.

<review>I recently bought a house in West Hills and needed a lot of work.
I contacted some contractors in the area , Prime gave me what I needed and met my budget. We changed the floors and remodeled all bathrooms and kitchen .
I highly recommend their services!!

Prime Home recently completed our bathroom remodel .
The manager of the project was accommodating , extremely helpful and helped us with design as we wanted.
He was very patient with explaining the process, his team started right away and were super respectful

<Text>Great garage work and they also remodeled the kitchen windows... we replaced the old wood framed to new white glass. Made the whole space look huge -- all the light comes in. They suggested it and they were right!</Text>< pictures>

<text>I purchased a home in Bellevue and wanted to hire a general contractor for a full renovation.
This experience was amazing from start to finish .
They gave me a full plan with all the details and didnt spend any minute got right to work.
They made sure to follow up on each step on the way .
I already recommended them to my neighbors.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>We had had a leak in our roof that was allegedly repaired twice now! I was heart broken from all the time and stress we put into that roof.. just to have people steal our money. At least fix the roof!!! Long story short we contacted prime after a good friend used their services. They were amazing! After they fixed it it stayed fixed and has not leaked since. Price was fair especially since they finally got it right.< /Text>< Pictures>

They do a clean and professional job . Always update me about changes in the schedule.

Scary to think that they change so little!!!
I believe I called them really late almost 5pm and they picked up the phone.
They gave me a basic offer on the spot.
They are extremely fast and they know 100% of the work they do!</review>

It has always been a place where we used to go with our family. It always feels like it the place is home. The food tastes great and is varied from meats, desserts and salads, the service people are attentive and the price is right. I like that they decorate their indoors depending on the holiday.

It really depends on area you go to, to see how they arrange themselves and cleanliness.

I recommend it to anyone that wants to have a good time and taste great American cuisine, mainly tourists<//text>

Overall great service. Staff was very friendly. Food was prepared well and kept cool or warm. The overall cost compared to other lunch buffet prices in the area was a little high but Hometown serves it purpose. Not upset but not overly pleased. Left full and satisfied.<//text>

<text>I've been coming here since I was a child. They have had changes in staff but the manager is always consistent. She's sweet and attentive and makes the environment comfortable. And she is so good with faces and recognized I hadn't been coming in as often as before. I hope this place doesn't get shut down. I'd truly miss her.</text>< Date>

Food offerings were fresh or promptly replaced. We visited at about 7pm on a weeknight. Only thing was the floors were really sticky, I'm guessing because of the made-to-order cotton candy (that stuff can be kinda messy). Kids loved the dessert bar and frozen yogurt.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

All booths seemed dirty, had to look through dishes to find a clean one but worst of all there was flies on all desserts! It made me feel gross after seeing that and a hair was even on one plate that had a slice of cake on it. I told a lady and she shewd the fly away and walked away. Guess I expected her to throw them away. Anyways maybe Install in some type of covering you can open and close, I'm sure it's not expensive. Sorry hometown, you let me down buddy.</Text>< Pics>

Worked here 22/23 years ago. It was a JOKE!!!! Management treated workers with psychological INTIMIDATION. After 4+ months, I got burned-out, and resigned. It’s been all downhill for this location ever since. I’m surprised they’re STILL afloat. Enjoy!!!!< /Text>

<review>My family and I eat here every now and then.   And Everytime we've come it's always been pretty good.  But we decided to go on a Friday about 11:30am.   It wasn't to busy which was a good thing.  The staff was friendly. I give them that.     But not sure what was going on in the kitchen.   But the food was horrible.   Seemed like no matter what we decided to put on our plate, the food was fairly cold and seemed to be undercooked.   The ice cream was runny,  it was just horrible.   This visit really made me think twice about coming to hometown ever again.</review><time>1564288145189< /time>< Resp>

<Review>Management needs an upgrade, in my opinion. Martha, the hospitality manager, was unprofessional when handling simple questions about a coupon. Could have been handled so much better, with tact. Tables were not cleaned well, crumbs left by previous patrons and wiped carelessly. Food was not worth the $18+ price for adult dinner w/drink. It was not busy at all for a family night, yet still seemed understaffed and the kid friendly food, pizza, came out slowly but surely, leaving the kids anxious.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>We have been recommending Home Town Buffet Covina to our friends in Ministry. This past Saturday was the first time we hosted a fund raiser.  We did it on behalf of our church but more importantly we wanted our friends in ministry to come and taste the food.  They were amazed at how good the food was.  We had all compliments.  The hospitality Manager Martha Acosta outdid herself in making our event memorable.  She was working so hard filling up the food for the big crowd of people, we didn't get a chance to introduce her to some of the Pastors who will eventually be booking fundraisers and dinners here.  We give her our appreciation and do hope that someone else can take her place in the kitchen especially when we are having our events so that others can get to know her!  Thank you so much Martha for everything!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

At what I would have to expect as the dinner rush, the restaurant was barely a quarter full. Very relaxing, indeed.
The pot roast and gravy was good. Unfortunately, not much else was noteworthy, especially at the price.
Both menu and preparation methods need an overhaul, especially in today's competitive market.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>a bigger lunch selection would be better. sometimes, the food is unappealing. it's more appealing when it just came out. buffets usually have that problem, and i think food control would allow for the food to look more appealing. it definitely is not as busy as before when they first opened up. management should consider more appealing food options, marketing, and quantity control. maybe, add on some mexican and asian choices too.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Since it is the only one left open in the area it's my favorite. It compares very well to the one in Rancho that closed last year. Very good table service & all of my Home Town favorite food dishes.<//Review>< gmapID>

<text>The price is good but vegetables are left soaking "all day" so they can taste like flavorless mush . Salad greens and toppings are a better choice. Sauces are a little bland but you can season with salt & pepper.  I am diabetic so I made the corn bread my dessert. It is moist, sweet and cake like. The eating area is clean & the tables are cleared and wiped off very quickly. This is a cafeteria type self serve place but I did notice a person in a wheelchair being assisted by an employee who acted as a personal server so the person did not have to reach out from a sitting position. There is ample parking but the entry door is not automatic.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The only thing was they seem to only have one person cleaning off the tables but Everyone bring out the food was nice and there was a girl in the desert section just as sweet, talkative and very helpful!

This place used to be good with the old guy manager. The menu was always full during busy hours. Dessert bar has the sprinkles, oreos. For the last 3 times, we were disappointed as we have to wait for food to come out. At once, all the plates are wet. Last week, it was better since most of the food are stacked but still some are missing. Thursday used to be busy but not much anymore. Food is still good specially fried chicken, pot roast, meatloaf and ice cream.  I miss the chocolate lava cake and chicken pot pie.< /review>

Took a friend out to dinner for his birthday.  Glad I picked Hometown Buffet cause he had so many different choices of food. He really enjoyed it.  We're going to come back on the weekend for your breakfast!< /text>

<review>OK why four stars do you ask? Each and every hometown buffet location has a specific choice of food for each and every community. Now what I mean is really racist but what’s not good about Having a meal that you know is going to be cooked by a certain ethnicity? This is not an average American restaurant it is a change of light with any buffet.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c3280c37b88cd5:0xc693042504a37665</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The salad mix looked like the veggies were picked months ago (brown on the edges & wilted greens). And all the rest of the food looked almost plastic, filled with preservatives. And the meats were completely dried out...
Plus I think 75% of the consumers forgot to shower. It was Full Nasal Assault!

Omelet station was pretty good, although the cook over cooked the eggs a little. Cinnamon rolls were not to my liking. The French toast, hash browns, fried chicken and chicken fried steak were all pretty good. The soft serve ice cream was a little icy, but overall pretty good. The restaurant itself was over all pretty clean.

The mens bathroom had one stall out of order and the toilet seat covers were empty in at least one of the other two stalls. The rest of the bathroom was pretty clean, but the faucet was close to the wall of the sink.<//review>

We took our kids on a Thursday night for Family Night. Kids eat for only $1.99. What i especially liked was they had kid friendly foods along with a wide selection of adult food. Donna (the woman who kept our table clean) was such a joy. Very friendly to my children! Will def be coming back because of her!< /text>

I work for Spectrum and we love the experience we get from the staff and management at our local Hometown Buffet in Covina, CA. They support all local business and that's a plus in my book. I would recommend Hometown Buffet for lunch and Dinner, always a friendly atmosphere, and the staff is exceptional.</Text>

<text>Omelet station was pretty good, although the cook over cooked the eggs a little. Cinnamon rolls were not to my liking. The French toast, hash browns, fried chicken and chicken fried steak were all pretty good. The soft serve ice cream was a little icy, but overall pretty good. The restaurant itself was over all pretty clean.

The mens bathroom had one stall out of order and the toilet seat covers were empty in at least one of the other two stalls. The rest of the bathroom was pretty clean, but the faucet was close to the wall of the sink.< /text><name>D K L< /name>< Time>

For the Azusa/Covina location.  Usually a good selection of food and good salad bar.  The workers are polite and always working to keep the place clean and the food stocked.  Great manager, he wants people coming back.<//text>

<Date>1528164772215<//Date><rate>1</rate><Review>I went in a spoke to the manager Martha about reserving tables in the front for 20 people. My dad loved this place, he had just passed & we wanted to have a “life celebration” there. She left a note at the register telling the employees that at 3pm Monday we would have a spot available for this event.  At 2:20pm on Monday we showed up to prepare & we were told that the note didn’t have the time, only the date & amount in the party, so she tossed it the trash. I didn’t much care that we didn’t get the group rate we were promised, or that we had to go to the back of the restaurant, but I was really hurt by the fact my dad went to this place for over 20 years & they didn’t give a damn about him. This place is filthy & nasty & the employees are rude & hateful. The food sucks too. I really wish we had done this at Golden Corral, but what’s done is done. No need to repeat my mistake, go someplace else if you have a group event, if you’re hungry, or if you just want a buffet</Review>< pics>

<Review>Worst place to ever spend your money on.
I'm surprised that this buffet is still in business!!!
Dirty floors, dirty counter tops, and dirty restrooms!!!!!
The food disgusting!!! Tasted like elementary school cafeteria food.
Will never spend money here again. Management really needs to hire more employees too keep this place clean.
Couldn't wait to leave for the exit. Never coming back here!

One of the only HomeTowns in the area and it had great selection although it is smaller than other locations that used to be open. Food is normal-good. Restroom toilets are alwaysssss leaking and the smell is very strong and off putting. This has been an ongoing issue for years! Their plumbing is horrible. I definitely avoid going if I seriously don’t HAVE to use the restroom.<//text>

The most disgusting place I have ever eaten dirty walls dirty silverware the ceiling has what it looks like food. And speaking of the food it’s bland no taste the fish is like plastic if I was a health inspector I would of closed this place down if the dining and line looks like this I can just imagine the kitchen what a waste of money I’d rather eat microwave food.<//Review>

<text>Great value and friendly staff. I don't expect exemplary food form a lower priced buffet but I do expect that there be options, no waiting, and a clean environment.   This location delivers on these expectations.

I would like to see more healthy  options available but I do understand their notch is comfort food.< /text>< Pics>

Reminds me of cafeteria school lunch. Not diabetic friendly and veggies are  unseasoned and tastes like they were heated up in the can. Perfect if you enjoyed school lunches.<//Text>

<Time>1558200763484</Time><name>Ibuycrazyhouses<//name><text>Went for brunch 10:30 am. Lunch starts at 11 am. They offered a special for a steak for $3 with breakfast. We ordered one.. Then at 11 they started serving steak at the carving station included in the price.
Their prices have increased and they now charge for drinks.
Some of their food tasted rotton. Told our server and manager was not a pleasent person. After spending $85 for my family I was disappointed in the treatment/ service we were given. After much complaining about the steak then them giving it out 15 min later she would not refund the price nor compensate on the nasty tasting rotton food nor did they remove it from the line. Just a shame they had went so down in quality. I can ubderstand why so many have closed perminantly.< /text>< Rate>

I work in food service and I have never been rude to a customer even if I was angry. Today I Came into this buffet and the manager Marcy gave me and my party the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never come back and I hope whoever is the owner of this business gets new management. I Was only in for 15 minutes and saw four others complaining about the older lady Marcy. Terrible service, I hope you get fired. No one should ever be treated bad when paying for a meal.< /review>

<Text>It had been a while since my wife and I had been to the Home Town Buffet.  We didn't want to take long to eat and decide that being able to sit down with food right away was a plus so we decided to go here.  It was clean, they had a pretty good selection to choose from, and we did get food right away, but overall we thought it was a little expensive for what we got.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Great place for breakfast! Love this place for breakfast!! Lousy dinners. The selection and quality has plummeted. The service at breakfast is fast. Dinner you are already filled up on carbs by the time entrees are refilled. Golden corral is a few bucks more but worthwhile for dinner. But breakfast is a steal at HTB.<//Review>

<review>Walked in and the cashier told me there was no lunch on Sunday and then I told the rest of my party that there was only dinner and as I was talking to my party about it. I overheard the Manager Daryl say "what happened? Too expensive for them?"
I took offense to that because he does not know our situation and should not be assuming that we could not pay for the food. I am Hispanic and I took that as a racist remark. Very rude.
The staff would always just stand to the side and talk to each other.
I will not be returning to this location unless there are some changes made. And I will let my friends and family know my experience at this location.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Skip this place. There were nats on some of the food, 3 out of 6 cups were caked with grime. Lot of the food was lukewarm or had been sitting out too long. The staff is friendly but if you can you're better off going somewhere else.< /Review>

<Review>My son loves it here mostly because of the desserts. The food is average, the meats a are dry and it seems that is always the same, they should put something new on the menu, at least once a month. The booths and tables are dirty like they haven't cleaned for a couple of years. No interaction from the servers or managers.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>March 2nd I planned for a "surprise"  lunch for my sister's 60th bday & had spoken to Martha ( the manager) prior to have tables reserved for 30 people , she gladly offered her & the staff's assistance if needed . When I arrived to decorate our area , she introduced herself & offered a reduced group lunch rate that couldn't be beaten . As it turned out 57 family members & friends came to celebrate & we needed more tables to accomadate us all which was done with no problem . Our group was able to be together & not split up in different sections. The staff did a fantastic job & kept the tables cleared of used plates .
We all had a lot of fun with tons of laughs & I personally want to thank Martha for allowing us to make "priceless memories that will be cherished on my sister's special day , I am truly grateful & thankful , it couldn't of been better . THANK 'S
AGAIN HOME TIME BUFFET , YOU ROCK !!

Just went there tonight.  The Manager,  Martha, very professionally dressed, loved her fusha colored tie. She
stepped in to help her crew when necessary.   ALL the servers and attendants were really working hard and helpful.
The food was "ok", to mass produced not the employees fault.  Also, they should order new plates or get rid of the older ones that looked stained, scratched, over used.</text>

<Text>My little family frequent this location a lot till yesterday’s bad experience. The restaurant has carpet all over and seems as everything they drop is making the carpet smell so bad. Yesterday when we took our seats it smelled so bad as if the carpet was humid, smelled like wet dog! We paid 50$ and I just wanted to get out cause I didn’t enjoy my food at all. The restrooms are the worst in this location, so dirty and mold everywhere!!!</Text><resp>{'time': 1562093540427, 'text': 'Hi Lily, we are sorry to hear this.

I came for dinner on VALENTINE'S DAY and i was so unhappy with the way it handles it's business.  Short staff, dirty silverwear , food all over the floor ,no  fresh salads .THE COOKIES were over cooked (hard).I use to like this place.I guess people don't care about the business they run .Good or bad......😣< /Text>

There was water coming out through the pipes near the food and beverage area. It was toilet water and, there was toilet paper pieces floating in the water.  They still let people in despite all of that.< /Text>

Just okay, food was plentiful.  It's a deal, but the quality is just okay.  The place was clean and the staff was nice.  We only went there because it was just a 1 min walk from Sky Zone and the kids were starving after jumping for an hour.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Terrible!!! I will never be back to this hometown. There was a fly in the jell-o, the coke was flat. They attempted to fix it and gave up after failing. The silverware was bent. When I took the jell-o to show it to the manager he asked "what is it? Hair? Foreign object?" Like if he was used to hearing complaints about the food. There was no attempt to rectify the situation. Nasty, nasty, nasty!!<//Text>< Pictures>

I went there three weeks ago and the breakfast was surprisingly delicious. I came back again last weekend and it was disgusting. The quality changes so much, you never know what you're gonna get. Even the orange juice was watered down a lot this time.<//text>

How are you gonna put medal bowls on a hot warming tray.  I burned 3 of my fingers at the desert counter because some genius decided it was a good idea 💡 to put lil mini metal pans on a heating ♨ type counter no sign advising it was hot. When I approached the manager she was walking 🚶 away from me and then simple offered burn cream no apologies nothing I had to speak to another manager who openingly admitted he told other manager to place a sign there the other day.. Their attitudes there are horrible and they don't apologize for anything.  Their going to find their selves in a major lawsuit that will force them into bankruptcy because of their ignorant staff and management…< /text>

<text>I've been to many other Hometown Buffet locations and I must say that this one is my least favorite location. First thing that caught my attention that I really disliked about this place is after I paid and walked past the kitchen area I could hear a lot of profanity and horse-playing going on in the back, which sounded very unprofessional - and not to mention there were alot of young children present whom I'm sure could hear the vulgar language coming from the back as well as I could. Secondly, the quality of food here was really not that great at all. The food was very tasteless and bland. I didn't even want to finish eating here because I just wasn't feeling the tasteless and half cooked food.

Not to sound too harsh here, but in all honesty if those guys in the kitchen put a little more pride in what they are cooking and put less time into goofing around and horse-playing and cussing at each other - the food might actually taste good here. As of right now, I will probably not return to this Hometown Buffet. I wouldn't recommend bringing your kids here either unless you want them hearing alot of profanity coming from the kitchen.</text><rating>2< /rating><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

First thing that caught my attention that I really disliked about this place is after I paid and walked past the kitchen area I could hear a lot of profanity and horse-playing going on in the back, which sounded very unprofessional - and not to mention there were alot of young children present whom I'm sure could hear the vulgar language coming from the back as well as I could. Secondly, the quality of food here was really not that great at all. The food was very tasteless and bland. I didn't even want to finish eating here because I just wasn't feeling the tasteless and half cooked food.

Not to sound too harsh here, but in all honesty if those guys in the kitchen put a little more pride in what they are cooking and put less time into goofing around and horse-playing and cussing at each other - the food might actually taste good here. As of right now, I will probably not return to this Hometown Buffet. I wouldn't recommend bringing your kids here either unless you want them hearing alot of profanity coming from the kitchen.</Text>

Mac and cheese sucked,  luckily I was just driving by so I won't have to eat there again,  it looked like it they were understaffed,  they ran out of mac and cheese,  and when they finally had some it was awful. Looked  watery and was waaay too salty,  as well as the ranch<//text>

<text>The salad w old brocolli was served twice to customers. Spoons and forks were not cleaned properly. Plates too.
Bathroom is just like the gas stations if worse..
The toilet paper holder un staps when geting paper and hits your hand..
It took three personel and 1 manager,to ask for rasberry ice when machine was out.

There was very little lettuce and it was covered in water. There was hardly any food prepared. There were no cups, the soda tasted horrible. Just an awful place. Go to Souplantation.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Western-style buffet. No Asian dishes. But the price is cheaper. Friends who like to eat grilled chicken legs and fried chicken nuggets, fries, spaghetti and salads may wish to try it. There are soft ice cream and some sweet cakes.

(Original)
西式的自助餐。沒有亞洲的菜式。不過價錢比較便宜。喜歡吃烤雞腿和炸雞塊，薯條，意粉和沙拉的朋友不妨去試一試。有軟雪糕和一些甜蛋糕。<//Review>
