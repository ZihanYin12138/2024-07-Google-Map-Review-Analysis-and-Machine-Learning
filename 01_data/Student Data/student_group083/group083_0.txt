<text>Went into this bike shop and told them I just wanted something for exercise cause I’m older and didn’t want to kill my self peddling, they suggested the 7 speed beach cruiser. It’s perfect for my needs. Want to thank everyone there for their help and kindness. Very friendly atmosphere and easy to talk to people. Thank you so much for your help and helping me do some exercises</text>< Pics>

The people that work there seem nice enough. I bought a headlight for my bike there for $40. Regrettably I threw the receipt away. The next day I found the same exact light on Amazon for $9.99. Talk about overcharging. Don't think I'll come here again</Text>

I was there yesterday around 1pm and the guy that helped me was very nice, friendly and knew exactly what I needed. Great customer service, friendly and even tho they were extremely busy they kept greeting every customer and making sure they knew they were going to be help . Everyone there is hands-on and they will go out of their way to help you. I' m happy I have found this place for my bike needs.

Thank you for the great customer service everyone at Apple Valley Bicycles

Keep up the great work<//Text>

I highly recommend Apple Valley Bicycles!! Kathleen and her crew were so very helpful when I came in just before closing to pick up a bike my daughter had picked out and had fitted 4 weeks ago with my husband. Our daughter thought she was getting a bike for her 16th b-day & had spent the day with her Dad searching for the perfect bike. Everyone was so patient with her as she tried several bike sizes. She's just short enough to be too small for a S yet not tall enough yet for a M. Great customer service! A+++< /Text>

<text>When I went there the lady was on the phone and there was no one to help me. On top of that she didn't even know what was damaged on my bike and to make matter worse she told me it would be a 10 day delay to get my bike fixed? Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a bike shop. Do yourself a favor and take your money else where.< /text><date>1617128526057<//date></record></dataset><record>
<review>Monday, 1 February 2021:  I live in Victorville, so  Apple Valley Bike shop was not my first choice, which I now regret. I went to a bike shop in Victorville and the man behind the counter was Not friendly at all. He did not even put on a smile or half a smile.  He told me the price, I left.

I then remembered that I sometimes drive to the army base and passing A.V bike shop in Apple Valley on 18 highway.  I called the shop, nice woman on the phone. A few days later, I went there and Shawn and Jon was great.  John did a great job in repairing my tires.  The entire staff is nice. Two thumbs up.<//review>< userid>

This shop is by far the best up here, I have been to all of them. I do my best to avoid going down the hill. The team there knows my name and I appreciate that in a shop. They listen to what my bike issues are and they take care of them in a timely manner. I live in the far South side of Hesperia and I do not mind driving all the way to their shop for their quality services.<//review>

They put tubes on my bicycle they are supposed to be torn proof but then i find out that there is no such thing even with torn proof tubes they still puncture so i paid extra for no reason and i was depending on this bicycle as my main mode of transportation my neighbor told me to get solid tubes but to get those it would cost about $100.00 that's $38.00 per tube then $15 per insulation so that is too rich for my blood if only i had my own tools i use to fix my own bicycles when i was younger but that's the way it' is if someone has tools they will over charge you for something simple they say not to use slime that it's bad for your valves but so is the other stuff that they use the last time i was riding the valve leaked quickly and i missed my interview which was very important</text>

Great place to buy a bike! I’ve purchased 4 bikes from these guys over the years for me and my kids, every time I go the staff are all knowledgeable and seem to care. Selection of products are good even during the covid19 craze on bikes I found what I wanted for both my kids at a reasonable price they seem to keep the bike shop stocked up with quality bikes. Positive experiences every time and bike repairs here are great never had bad tuneups or repairs. I’d recommend this place 👍🏼</Review>

The owner, Kathleen, was so nice and very courteous. I was unsure on what bike to buy my little brother and she was extremely knowledgeable on showing me all of the good options for him. She measured his height to make sure the frame of his bike was perfect and even went the extra mile to measure his head to get him a perfectly fitted helmet.

This shop has great customer service and I would highly recommend this bike shop for all of your biking needs.< /Text>

<text>Very rude store owner. Asked to look at a certain bike and she gave a dirty look. Also went there 3 times and they never have what I am looking for. I’ve been to 2 other stores and this one was by far THE WORST. Then men who work there know how to provide great customer service. The rude lady needs to learn from them.<//text>< Pictures>

I originally took my old bike in to see if it could get fix. She immediately tried to sell me Cannondale bikes. Later I found out she was over pricing me. I argued with her for a bit and left.

So me and my brother went to get a sandwich next door..  decided to take a look at the shop and look at some bikes.  Long story short my brother bought one of the baddest bikes and a bike for his son.  Can’t remember the guys name but was very cool and help full.  The staff was cool and also the guy that works on the bikes.  That being said my grand son found a old dyno VFR frame in my shed.  Wants to build it not buy a new one.  Hope they can help build a cool old to new bike for my grandson.  Thanks guys for the first experience!!</review>

I bought my wife and I two "Addmotor" E-Bikes at this store and my experience was just wonderful! Sean and his  brother that work there were ultra friendly, attentive, and went out of their way to give us a demo! The owner is ok, not friendly at all, at least to me, and it can be pricey. I still go there because of the employees and because its a mile from my house. The guys there that work on the bikes are very knowledgeable and always very cool, open and friendly, that means a lot to me. One bike I bought had some troubles, and after I brought it back for repair a couple of times, they informed me they had gotten me a brand new bike! The new bike was/is perfect! That is why we bought from them, first off they are local, they know how to do E-Bike repairs, sell them, and are really nice folks, and most of all they stand behind the products they sell. Buying these E-bikes was a great decision for us. It has gotten us out of the house, helped us exercise. No matter what my slight negatives are the repair service is always good and keeps us rolling on the road.</text>

<review>I have not been here yet to buy my trike, however this was on my mind as I scrolled through the reviews....

I’ve seen posts about the prices being high. Perhaps prices are set by cost of living? It’s costs a small fortune just to get started in business here in Apple Valley. Permits ,inspections etc. I know, because I have just paid all those fees to get started here. I have spent at least $400 getting business licenses and inspections and office-permits. In Riverside county Canyon Lake Calif. no inspections for $300, no office permit for $150. Just a biz license for $100 . And renewal is $41 per year. Blah blah blah.

So those who can get it cheaper elsewhere, is probably because cost of living and doing business in your home town is less costly.  Just me sticking up for small business owner!,</review>< name>

<Text>Great, efficient, quick service. Shawn friendly, helpful & knowledgeable. Kathleen helpful and right on it when we wanted to drop our bikes off for an estimate, before work was to be done. Have been taking our bikes here since 2006.

By the way, during this #socialdistancing time, they are one of the ONLY bike shop open from Oak Hills to Vegas!

No!... stay away from this location. The owner over charges waaaaay to much on bike repairs and the prices on buying bikes is marked way to much. For some of us in this area I know we have no choice but to deal with situations like this because of the lack of bike shops but YOU ARE BETTER OFF going somewhere else. Shame on this owner for her shams and over charging outrageous prices for repairs and buying!</Text>

Dropper post? for 31.6 Seat tube they can order but not in stock.
How bout Handle bars? for a MTB? "we don't carry them."  REALLY?
Rear derailleur for 11 speed SLX ? Nope!
11 speed chain.. Nope
+ sized 27.5 tires?  no Dice.

So if it breaks and you need a part then This Place Can ORDER it but expect to wait a week + for parts.

The times I've been in this store its cramped in the bike section with all the bikes on the floor but no room to even pull one out to sit on it The Rear shop is Open and its packed. They are always backed up with work 1-2 weeks out. So its clear these guys fix lots of bikes, are good at it and have a solid customer base. For parts and the Standard wear items you might find In stock at a bike shop these guys either don't keep em in stock or just don't have a market for it, nevertheless i can't see going out of my way to a shop that consistently Has nothing for me.

this might be a sign of the times where these shops will only Repair and Sling bikes and Parts are ordered in on a need only basis.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
A good friend of mine gave me his black fixed gear bike, I took it here to get some new tires and freewheel cog as well as a new chain. John as well as the lady (not sure if it's his wife..) were very helpful and got all the work done quickly. I'm very happy with the result. John gave me some advice on fixed gear bikes and his riding experiences since I'm new to these types of bikes. Very friendly and easy guy to talk to, really enjoyed having conversations with both of them. I'll be taking my fixed gear here whenever needed. Definitely would recommend taking your bike or kids bikes here.< /Review>

This place is aweful, the people who work there forget you the second you leave. I’ve spent more than a thousand dollars on bikes for the family and they’ve yet to stand behind their bikes. Usually it’s awkward and weird in there, they try to sell you bike and completely don’t  remember you already bought 4 freakin bikes there. I won’t go back.< /review>

After driving from bike shop to bike shop in the high desert, I was ready to give up.  I was so tired of the staff being so rude especially the bike shop in Hesperia. . . good grief, if the older guy hates customers he should get out of the business.  I found Apple Valley Bicycles and decided to go in.  Immediately they greeted me as I walked in,.  The staff was cheerful and obviously looked like they love the business of bicycles.  John helped me with my tt  bike, I had problems with my gears and the other places didn't know how to fix, John took one look and fixed it in about 5 minutes.  The shop was busy that day and the staff reassured me they could solve my problem, which they did.  They've got my business from now on.<//text>

Good selection of bikes, knowledgeable staff that is involved in the local BMX scene.  I take all my bikes there for repairs and upgrades. (Even the wacky upgrade of a 3 speed hub on my Quadra Sport and a throttle cable on my gas powered tricycle)  Katherine and Steve are the best.  If you're tired of fixing flats see them for slime tubes tire liners!< /text>

Food is good. Pupusas are a good size and very filling. Sadly, during the summer their is no a/c so I suggest you visit later during the evening. Overall, customer service is great.< /Text>

Food was excellent.  Establishment was also very nice, clean and well maintained. My only complaint was that they take forever to take and get your order out. Walked in at 5:00pm got my food at 5:42.< /text>

This is my favorite spot to eat pupusas! I been following them since they were next to Elizabeth's Bakery. Both the cook and the waitress are very nice. I recommend this place to everyone who wants to eat pupusas!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This restaurant is disgusting, My coffee and My husband were served with dirty rates, and the waitress tells me that she washes the dishes, does not wash well, that is not an excuse, hence they are wrong with the bill, they charge In addition, fix the total, the manager is rude, yells at customers, is grocero, bad experience not recommended.

(Original)
Este restaurant es un asco, me sirvieron Mi cafe y de Mi esposo con las tasas sucias, y me dice la mesera es el que lava trastes la culpa, no lava bien, eso no es escusa, de ahi ce equivocan con el bill, cobran de mas, fijence de el total, el manager es un grosero, le grita a los clientes, es grocero, mala experiencia no lo rrecomiendo.<//review>

<Text>Ill start with this staff member was very polite and helpful. The door was locked due to register machine temporary issue that was solved the staff was apologetic and tried to accommodate me. The good did not have pricing I had to ask for every price of items that I had in mind but again staff was nice and helped me right away with answers. The gas itself was pricier then other places and it did not last at my tank. But again the staff was nice to me:)</Text>< rating>

<resp>None</resp><text>Would not allow patrons to use the restroom.  Ca. Law states any service station within 600ft of a highway must maintain bathroom for customer access, including access for disabled.  Wound up going to Kentucky Fried Chicken a couple of doors down where every other person who walked in had to use the restroom and had just come from this gas station.  SHELL?  ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION HERE?  Your franchisee is breaking the law and hurting your customer relations.<//text></record>

What horrible service. My daughter was feeling sick and needed to use the restroom but the attendant wouldn't let her in the room until I started pumping gas. I tried to explain to him that I am topping off but she really needs to go now. Then he refused to let her in because he thought I cussed at him. When I walked in to try to explain why she needed to go now he called the police! I've never seen such a horrible display of customer service in my life.<//review>

<Text>Great customer service gas is expensive as other's have stated.
i've been going  to this station for the past 6+ years to ski & camp in lake tahoe area. everyone i'v encounter here are always courteous & super nice. i don't now what other do to get those reaction from the attendant.

maybe all of you try to be lil nice next time you walk into a business establishment.</Text><Date>1461732641127</Date>< name>

<review>Gas prices are at least 50 cents higher than average.  Cashier gives you a lot grief if you attempt to use the nasty bathroom with buying something.  There are plenty of signs saying the bathrooms are for paying customers.  No need to give people crap before they buy something.</review><Time>1482128510009<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Total rip off. Just up the road you can get gas for over a $1 per gallon less. Typical rip off Shell.< /Review>

<text>Very nice motel.  Super clean.  My family girls and I felt very safe.  The laundry facility was much better than expected and very clean.  I asked for a 15 minute grace to check out, I was given an hour.  I would definitely stay there again.</text><userid>116336831144461287994</userid><gmap_id>0x80dbf4bd699eeadf:0xb1d2535d7e044ea4<//gmap_id>< Rating>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Terrible place. Room had water damage all over the place also smelled like mold. We were charged a damage fee for the smell of smoke in the room even though we did not. There are no signs for designated smoking areas nor did the manager say anything about one so we knew nothing about these areas but I guess having a cigarette in the parking lot while leaving constitutes having "smoke damage" in the room. There were also numerous other terrible qualities about this place. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Motel 6 across the street.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Horrible! The manager walked into my room at 8:00am before checkout. This was unacceptable. It is ridiculous that I had to jump to the door to show my ID because they say someone called using my name. Your information is not safe here. Then the manager said it was MY fault, that I must have given my information to someone, which I did NOT. The fire alarm went off inside the room from the STEAM of the shower, warm water, mind you. Will never come back here, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I checked in to this place and the guy at the front desk was excited about the new remodeled rooms and the "deluxe" he was going to give me.  I told him I just moved from MI for a job and I was just looking for a cheap place to lay my head and rest.  Somehow he took that to mean instead of sleep I wanted him to call me at 3am in the morning to discuss some mistake he made on the invoice.  I tell him the only thing I care about is a bed and sleep, SMH.  I was offered "extra hours" for check out "next time".  1st off, I have to work in the morning.  2nd, I don't think I'd be going back because it seems like they have a problem listening.</text>

Manager and some of the staff are often rude, offensive, and disrespectful. The "do not disturb" sign is meaningless to house keeping and maintenance, they will ignore it and knock anyway. Bugs kept getting in room and staff suggested I not open the door as a solution. Don't be surprised if and when you hear, feel, and perhaps even see people having sex. If that's not something you want to experience, tough, nothing will be done. The extremely positive reviews are probably those very people, the ones who are not bothered are often times the ones doing the bothering. Most front desk employees and managers, with the exception of the very sweet girl who works in the morning/day are extremely unhelpful. Deluxe room was wonderful, however. It was spacious, clean, flat screen tv, comfortable bed, microwave, fridge, brand new furniture, hair dryer, all for a good price. The rooms aren't the issue, its a couple of the employees and some of the disrespectful, selfish, and inconsiderate guests that are a huge problem and why I left. And not to mention, why I will not be returning.</text>

Really nice hotel they have nice big rooms with microwave and fridge the rooms are very comfortable to be in. They have coffee 24 hours a day and the staff are very friendly they also have lots of tv channels and great wifi. Ive been coming to this hotel for 7 months and never had a complaint its a great place to be and they also have great prices. I recommend anyone coming to Escondido to stay at this hotel you wont regret it.< /text>

My relative and I were on vacation and seen the sign
so we  decided to stop...
I'm very glad we did. We had a great upscale room (newly remodeled) room... Very clean and the staff there is tremendously friendly.. I would for certain choose Mt Vernon every time I'm in town.. It almost made me feel at home(with a new family)... Check them out for sure..<//text></record>

This was cheap motel quality for 4 star pricing.  This was the only place that still had vacancy is the only reason we stayed.  Spend the extra money and fine a better place in the area.< /review>< Pictures>

I have never stayed here. I just stopped by for the Pokemon GO gym. It looks like they are currently doing A LOT of renovations, and from what I've heard, theres new owners. This is definitely a good thing, since this place is generally seen as a VERY sleazy motel, filled with drug users, dealers and very shady people. The area is particularly seedy as is at night.</text>

<text>Fairly nice accommodations most rooms are already or scheduled for remodeling with good size flat screens the room and semi classy bathroom sinks, countertops, and fixtures. The manager working most the time, Neil, is a really great guy, very caring, respectful, and overachieving for his customers. Without him my rating of 4 out of 5*s would drop to .5 stars.Security's a little irritating and sketchy as well as are younger gentleman that worked at the front desk and the pool could be fixed up a little bit as well as outside handrails repainted and walls Reese Tucker and the gutter it's next to kind of cleaned up and fence repair but other than those few flaws and the occasional group of questionable visitors I've enjoyed my stay @ the Elegant and Classy Mt. Vernon about 96% of the time</text>< Pics>

I have called to ask for about my service dog and they said they are excepted but not excepted. When I asked why they could not tell me over the phone they wanted me to book a room first than tell me if my dog would be excepted. I try to ask another question but they hung up on me than I called back they hung up once more. This is not a way to do do business.</review>

<review>I had a fantastic room. Large TV, oversize room with a refrigerator and microwave. The office staff are nice and the maids made the beds and cleaned the room so nicely. I left in the middle of the week and the office refunded me honestly and fairly. A nice experience. I would stay here again.

Owners are very nice, the place needs to be cleaned, the floors are dirty. It is in a shady area entrance and exit are horrible. Overall it was okay. Would I come back? Probably not. You get what you pay for<//Review>

<review>I stay here all the time for my construction job and I love the place. The room's are huge for a motel and it's quiet which is what I like. There's always been a microwave and fridge in every room I've been in there. I have no idea what all these other crazy reviews people are posting... "cops doing drugs and banging hookers" lol seriously who would write that? I would recommend this place to anyone</review>< pics>

Not that the sheets are't clean or their rooms are disgusting--- No,  quite the contrary!   Neil, always problem-siolving (that man is so smmart,  I know); and Chris,  always engaging, charismatic and sharp-dressed.  But little Alejandra, she is my favorite,  somehow,  such a beautiful,  sweet & intelligent,  caring lovely girl (young woman, actually), and I don't think ever has a bad day.  These are the front front desk clerks and definitely do the rub the show.  They have done tap-dancing for me on one occasion or another--- and they dance well and, usually, even have cookies with their delicious,  fresh,  brewed coffee,  no matter what time you end up having your morning!   Lol!   And the maids,  they are just as willing to phrase and understanding of your needs.   Throw in that glistening pool, in Escondido, on a hot day?  You know where I'm gonna be hanging when it gets hot---- there, at the pool or maybe at the full-sized tennis court.  This may be possibly one of North County's next best kept secrets, especially when they're finished with their renovations! Great job, aMt.  Vernon.   Thanks for always having a room for me💋< /review>< Pics>

The moment i walk in it smelled like a pack a cigarettes were being smoked in my face. The staff sevice might as well be a operator that put you on hold because we did NOT receive room sevice for the 3DAYs we payed for!! I even begged them to send someone.  Still nothing.  i have 3 children. one that is 10months old and he had to sleep in his car seat the last night because the bed was just nasty from my 5 and 4yr walking on the dirty floors and jumping on the bed.  The tub had burns all over the shower head didnt even turn on. The fridge and tv didnt work .. I promise you i am NOT making this up i have photos that i sent to the manager that did not help us.

The only thing is that there should be a fixed rate.One day I was told $60 , the next day i went to pay for another day and it costed me $66 then the following day i was charged $77, on a Thursday it costed me $80,Friday the price i was quoted was $90 out the door then a few hours later went to check in and pay again i was told $95. I think Sun - Thurs. should be $66 and Fri - Sat. should be $76  that  would included the tax.Miss Wally working there. He understood and seemed to show the client tell compassion and was always fair.< /text>

I appreciate the man making it easy to get a room at the last minute.  I also didn't mind having to wait on him to fix the remote control for the television; however, it was the bed bugs.  They bit myself, and my family to the point where our skin was burning.  I only used the room to sleep, and then I was up and out for my niece's graduation.  It was an annoying, and embarrassing, to show up in that condition.<//text>

<text>Mika is amazing, she has continuously been an amazing help always going above and beyond to accommodate us every single stay. Rooms are nice size all include fridgerator and microwave and the newer remodeled rooms are much better than the old out dated carpet ones are. There is always fresh hot coffee available any time day or night. The maids can be rude and very impatient come checkout time but thats really my only complaint. Overall this is a good spot to stay for the money.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Friendly staff. The front desk assured me that the new room would have a tv remote and be bed bug free. Not a chance I had to walk back to the front desk to get the tv remote and didn't even bother switching rooms again. I meen why would you. All the rooms have bed bugs and roaches. At lease the one I had the bugs were all hiding because I scared them off.  To end on a good note the front desk attendant was a first class gentlemen. As a smoker this is a good note so I will mention it. All rooms are smoking rooms even if they say no smoking.</Review>

<Text>Depending on who you ask, this old hotel has
an eye opening reputation all across the county.
For example, my parole agent warned me to stay away
from the MVI. Like most all old; low priced, hotels
this place attracts the lowest rung of impoverished
hapless customers (some of whom trek up in here straight
from dtheir nasty hobo camps pushing their rusty shopping carts). I was expecting to see a 24/7 outdoor​ assembly of
Escondido tweekers and "at large: felons posted up in the parking lot like they do at the Sunset Inn.
Instead I found this place to be delightfully quiet and private. I like that its surrounded by several fastfood places.
The resident cockroaches are small and not too imposing or selfish about eating your food or nesting in your bed.
The price is friendly and so is the staff.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

<Time>1401446290006<//Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Friendly experience with all of the staff. Quiet place, because the staff will come and tell the people that are bothering their neighbors, but that just doesn't seem to happen here (I stayed for several weeks).
They are renovating their rooms, though the room that I stayed at that hadn't been renovated was just fine. I then moved to a renovated room that had a Jacuzzi tub. I had to have staff track down a bathtub drain stopper (I can't figure out how they have a tub but no way to hold the water in :-) but we eventually got it and enjoyed the jets while watching some tv and having some take-out.
Overall a great experience. It's no ritz-carlton, but it will do when you have limited budget and want a clean, safe and quiet place to stay.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I can only say that 1 of the guys gave me a good deal on a room ($60) but that young girl that works there in the mournings shouldn't be working there, I'm Srry to say but I think she's a little slow. She kept coming up with these weird prices 60 here 80 there like come up with a price and stick with it..... The room could be a lot better as far as paint, cleanliness, etc... Cuz for a room like that the condition I should be only paying 30 to 45 a night and that pushing it... And if you want a hooker and get some drugs while your at it just stand outside for 5 mins....< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>Put our name on a wait-list and was told it would be an hour wait. Left to get a drink at another bar while waiting and they texted me 15 minutes laters saying I had to be there in 5 minutes or lose my spot. My wife ordered from the bartender and asked for something less sweet that was similar to another drink on the menu. Instead she got the sweet drink from the menu. Then we felt rushed to finish our drinks and leave.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80db7fc7623e2525:0x2a71ab6db20901ce< /GmapID></record>

<Review>This is a Nice Speakeasy. I've been to about 6 different Speakeasy's and this one is ranked somewhere above average. The entrance is a bit disappointing because it isn't hidden and it just takes away from the mystique of a hidden bar.... although the Vault Door is very cool.
Now, where this place really shine's is it's customer service. They are very friendly and the best part is they are very organized. If your reservation is at 10pm, they are ready for you at 10pm....Big A+.  The drinks are very well made. Bartender's take there time to make your drink correctly. Also the decor is on point. Great job.
This place would have been a solid 5 star if it wasn't for the entrance compared to the other Speakeasy's I've been to. I still highly recommend.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA4QT-moFJ3O-tmyMEshjWU7k1xXBQGbGU3XjA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFniU5Ns8u8wHuEtE7r1gtK_tghehzftB3t7_f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgmjoaQQ2ljTT3F9zXtxRZ3eQtG_4p3vVKjbwC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqqL__cwDQ6RyOK0XpzIQ7gcdO4Ogwn0Pw53zj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM2BAEVWTuFtFAySNObZe3Xkto-jAuRnWfHDkJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbmWnLo-KGS-yZpABxLPRNyvhnUGwdDPf6LaYn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmnal9wDZ48TJcmlIBWcmA6WCdqdHRlzM05TzY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMX0amgVgJUDVrFCy55R7x3hdP053NtA3s43jf2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh0niScNh4zus8RNoGtU4lgx2EKGdr3Jgssxk0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmqfG9fbbaEMpz65P_Xhq5-k9_QnQgsGcPnBOq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ4DobI2nYjNjZut-oKpCkm2kvLbuYWwVnbgeG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80db7fc7623e2525:0x2a71ab6db20901ce<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Incredible place. Cool interior as a mix of prohibition and western style. The bartender was very nice and helpful with the decision. Had 2 great drinks with an amazing taste. The hidden bar is a gem and after going through the curtain you dive into a different time.<//Text>

<text>This place is just fantastic. Whether you're ordering off of their very creative menu or attempting to try any classic cocktails you ever wanted to imbibe in this is the place you want to get your drinks at. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the  Mixologists at this establishment and they are all very well educated on classic bartending.  This staff has a true Passion for making fantastic cocktails. I guarantee you will not find any place that will hold a candle to this location within a 100 miles. If you are within a reasonable distance check this place out you will not be disappointed.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Incredible place. Been here multiple times for 2 separate birthdays. The bartenders always hook me up and they are incredible at their craft. I highly recommend this place. Make reservations so you don't have to wait. But even if you do it's well worth it. I recommend going to the bar at crush and brew to bide your time. All in all, these gentlemen have always taken care of me and I recommend you visit them and tip them well. 👍😊<//Review>

If you find yourself in Temecula please take the time to check this bar out. You will be glad you did. Incredible what they managed to do in such a small space. The service there is also amazing...from the hostess whom was warm, thorough and super welcoming to the guys at the bar mixing your drinks. You can taste their love and knowledge for the craft the moment you take that first sip. Call ahead to make a reservation, or if you are like me, just walk up and wait a few minutes for a table to open up.</review>

<review>Great location!!  The bar is very well stocked with some not so easy to find libations... Particularly great whiskeys! The bartenders are quite good as well at this location. I tried to stump them with some older, off the wall drink requests that they were all too happy to serve up with a smile. We will be back for more soon! Highly recommended!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><gmapID>0x80db7fc7623e2525:0x2a71ab6db20901ce<//gmapID></record>

Had my birthday here. It was awesome. Drinks were amazing. Service was excellent. Highly recommend checking this place out. If you can, make reservations as it's a tight fit. You have to do them online which was kinda annoying, (would've rather talked to someone) but overall really impressed.< /Review>

<Text>Text for reservations, you'll need them. You will not see signs of their entrance from the street and that's the way they like it. This word-of-mouth craft cocktail bar has a mid-19th Century, "Old Town" theme. Instead of curtains as their entrance I wish they would install saloon doors. The drinks are all priced at $14 each. They offer ounch bowls, meant to be shared and are very delicious. Staff is dressed to fit the theme and provide great service. The only dislike I had was were the acoustics. Everyone seems to be competing with each other to talk and the music choice didnt fit the decor theme at all. Overalll, it's a cool place to sip classy cocktails.<//Text><rate>4<//rate>< pictures>

< review>
If i cpuld give this place 10 syars i would. Best bar in the world. Its a true speak-easy. Drink prices are 13 bucks which is totally reasonable they have a victorian style decor best ive ever seen its designes so well i would recommend makinf reservations as seating is limited they also have. "Easter eggs all around" which means it looks like a victorian picture or decoration from the early centuries but is actually modern most of the ones i found are pics and letters from back to the future<//review>

Fun, quaint, expensive.  They should at least have some sort of snack like nuts or pub mix.  Alcohol should never be served without having the option for food.</Review>

<text>Lovely little coffee shop in Scott's Valley with delicious coffee, delightful pastries, and friendly baristas. They knew their regulars well, which is always a good sign. They had a lot of food too, not just coffee. They serve Lulu Carpenter's coffee here, which I had never had before, and their espresso was very nice, bright, bold, with a hint of berry (to my taste buds at least).

My wife loved her latte with whole milk, which she usually sweetens but didn't and still really enjoyed. Her breakfast bagel was also very good. My cappuccino was bright, the espresso strong, and the oat milk (Oatly Barista) paired well with it. I also ate a Lemon poppyseed with lemon curd muffin which was really nice and moist. Such a lovely way to start the day.

Highly recommend checking it out. Plenty of outdoor seating too. Followed all Covid guidelines.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMGh2q3VloURmobFiUUHLdVHBrk2FJD4afOjpU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM57_ER8s9NnA2ZQOGEFO2QMTQNfe6glzoqPNtS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJLq193M2R-mIg3FYU8D90II2GTxF-RY4ohss-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Response>None</Response><Review>I Love Coffee!!

So driving to Santa Cruz and had a craving for coffee so yelped this place and seemed like great reviews. Decided to check it out. Parking out side was a breeze. Plenty of parking available. Walking in the store has a nice coffee smell. Everything in the shop looks clean and professional and organized. Felt like a homey coffee shop.

There was a group of 7 of us and we all got our own special coffee. For the 7 of us the barista did a very fast and accurate job and even made foam prints on our lattes (unfortunately forgot to take a picture). I personally got the coconut syrup hot latte and my fiancé got the same thing but iced. The quality of the drink was acceptable.

1 small downside.  Not sure if they don't provide it or if they just didn't have any when we were there but they didn't have any hot cup sleeves. When I asked she kindly offered a second cup which was nice.

Overall expensive was definitely a 5 Star. And if I ever catch myself in this area again. Will be coming back<//Review>< user_name>

Very chill cafe with delicious pastries and good coffee. Strangely their 'take out decaf coffee' is not good but if you drink it there it's great.<//Review>

Nice atmosphere and comfortable with plenty of seating. It's too bad the coffee is awful. I drink 2-4 cups a day, from 7-11 and Folgers to Black Rifle and Philz, and I always finish my cup(s). This is one of the few places I've left my coffee unfinished, it's that bad.

Otherwise it's a pleasant experience with nice staff and a decent spread of quick bites.</text>

<user_name>Pandon Phenom< /user_name><resp>None< /resp><Text>Coffee was warm perfect drinking temperature one i got it. Which is fine but by the time i actually got my food it was cold. The coffee was good just wish it had been warmer. Food was also pretty tastey for the price though i could have gone to a restraunt.
I will give this place another try at some point but after today i think the place across town is much better.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Fast and friendly service. Clean interior. Tasty food and most importantly well made espresso and espresso drinks. Coffee Cat is part of Lulu Carpenter's, a long-standing local company which has several cafes in Santa Cruz. In my experience they have been making excellent coffee for decades. Their shops may not be as big or modern as some third-wave cafes but the coffee is just as good...and perhaps a bit less expensive as well. If you're headed in or out of Santa Cruz and want good coffee off of Highway 17 check out Coffee Cat.</Text>< Pics>

Make the best soy lattes EVER & the staff is ALWAYS friendly. Contemporary interior; always
clean. Free latte w purchase of reasonably priced quality 1lb club-roasted coffee beans: great man-gift. Upgraded food choices last year: awesome bacon-wrapped egg with goat cheese! I always leave with 2x peanut butter/ choc swirl cookies; never a problem (note: we stop here 1-2x/mo).<//Text>

I stopped in here for a hot second. My coffee was delicious and the store was recently remodeled so it was nice. I would definitely come back and sit down.< /Review>

<text>Great local coffee shop/roaster! First time in and the mocha was excellent (not too sweet with a nice savory chocolate flavor). I look forward to trying some straight coffee next time to see how their roasts taste!< /text>< Rate>

We stop here every time we drive to Big Basin Redwoods State Park to camp. We always get the Honey Hazelnut Latte. The coffee is fabulous and they have amazing pastries. It's definitely worth the detour!</review>

Coffee is really great. Service is not so great.
Out of 5 visits, 3 times I waited more than 20 minutes for my order of one single item. 2 of those 3 times, my order was lost and forgotten, then made after I had aleeady been there too long. Great coffee. Not worth the wait.< /Text>

< Review>
I sadly misjudged Coffee Cat for many months and titled my nose as I drove past to visit Starbucks and Peet's for my regular coffee & work sessions. But thankfully the coffee gods did not give up on me and recently guided my vehicle to Coffee Cat.

Boy have I been missing out! Upon walking in I was excited to see a very spacious seating area with nice wood tables and way less people than the other big-name coffee shops. They even have power outlets along the entire wall for all those seated along it - amazing! The wifi is also very good and the bathrooms are decently clean.

And to my even greater surprise, they have a Clover!! I love coffee pulled from a Clover, always my first choice if available which is rare. Their other coffee selections are also very good and the ladies really know what they are doing behind the counter. They also have a great food selection with healthy, authentic ingredients. And if that isn't enough, Safeway is right next door - very convenient.

Overall, I am very impressed with Coffee Cat and have directed all of my coffee funds and work sessions here. Thank you CC!< /Review>

Best damn coffee in Santa Cruz. Seriously overtly flavorful beans for home brewing. And the baristas make espresso drinks quite well (where as many good roasters's product is best enjoyed made at home in the Chemex).
I absolutely love the 1 and 1.
I also haven't received the stereotypical pretentious attitude often given at high end cafes.<//text>

They can make coffee practically any way you like it, and their food is fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that some of the seating is not very comfortable, but that is just how goes sometimes.< /text>< Rate>

< Review>
I've been going here for years, BUT there is a new owner now. Do not use this place anymore. The new owner does not care about his customers... and their equipment/machinery is slashing people's tires. The owner does not want to pay for the damage so we had to call the police to report it. And we will be taking this to small claims. This happened to another lady there as well. All his employees I've known for years and they were shaking their head at the new owner and how he handles his customers. He hid in his office because he didn't want to deal with is. Ridiculous!<//Review>

I tried to be happy with the results since my car IS cleaner, but this has been eating at me since yesterday afternoon. I've come here for years and yesterday was the first and last time I ever come here for a detailing. It's also the first time I haven't tipped.

$170 for a full detail and seat/carpet shampoo. Three hours. After all that money and time, they missed: bug goo on the hood, the driver's side and passenger side sun visors, gear shift, sides of center console, dust in the vent slats, and still some dust remaining in crevices. My car also smelled vaguely of wet dirt afterwards.

I get that cleaning cars is exhausting. I paid the price to have the job done better than I could do it. Unfortunately that expectation wasn't met and now I have to follow-up on my off day. I could do better in 5-6 hours what they did with multiple people in 3.

This place is great for a quick wash and vacuum, but you should probably go to a specialty company for detailing.

Update: The fabric panelling on the driver's side door has started to bubble up. That's it, I'm going to ask for a refund. Not only is this a job badly done but now my car is damaged. Thanks.

Update 2: I asked for a refund yesterday and they said all they could do is detail my car again. They might think I'm a pushover because I try so hard to be nice, even when stuff like this happens. Really it's just that I don't have the time to bother with it and don't want them touching my car after they damaged it. I could technically file an insurance claim but again, won't bother. I'll be contacting my bank for a refund instead. I'm also pleased that my review brought their rating from 4.0 to 3.9. Never coming back here, they should call themselves "Whatever Wheel Car Wash" because that's the level of service you get here.

Update 3: I got a full refund through Wells Fargo, although it took 30 days because Water Wheel didn't respond to the transaction dispute.

Thanks for reading!< /Review>

<Review>I took my car to get a good clean on the outside and inside. First off, it’s very over priced. I paid 100.00 plus a huge tip. Second, I noticed whoever cleaned my car on the inside stole some expensive things I had in there. For that I give one star cause it was my property that they stole from. Very unprofessional work. Whoever works there is a thief. Do some background checks before hiring. I won’t recommend. Never going back. I’ll find  another spot.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

Never again!!  I had the worst experience at Water Wheel car wash.  Normally, I purchase a booklet of 10 washes.  Since I bought the last one, I noticed the carwashes haven’t been as good, as in the past; a very poor job on the inside vacuum….and in general very poor service today. Additionally, the cashier was not wearing a mask!

While I was waiting for my second car to arrive for a carwash, I was approached by an employee.  He explained to me that under the new rules, prior to exiting into the waiting area, you must pay first.  I wasn’t claiming my car, as I told the employee I was not ready, because I was waiting for my other car to arrive for a washing.  He called
the owner, and I once again explained the same reason that I was not ready to pay, due to the fact that I was waiting for a second car to arrive, and I was going to pay both cars at the same time…and more importantly, I was also waiting for the payment coupon book.
The owner was very rude and said, “If I didn’t like the service, to go to another place to get a carwash.”

I’ve been a patron of Water Wheel for approximately the past 15 years, and now I understand why I don’t see many cars there anymore….bad customer service along with poor quality job on carwashes.  They just lost a customer, as I will gladly take my business elsewhere.</review>

Good wash. Workers use an air hose to dry the window seal, so that there are no streaks when you roll down your window, very important.< /Review>

Not only is the car wash mediocre at best for the price point but today my low tire pressure indicator turned on as soon as I started to drive away. Got out of my car and found out my tire was damaged with audible sound of air escaping. After bringing it up to the front desk and manager they looked at it and basically shrugged their shoulders and said it must’ve happened before we got there. They told me to go over to the mechanic next door to have it looked at so we did under the assumption that they were gonna repair it. Nope, they basically pointed out what we already knew and wanted to charge us for it.

Spend your money elsewhere there’s better quality places in the area at the same price point<//Text>

Fast car washes for very fair prices. Lines can be long depending on what time you go, but usually takes around 10-15 minutes without a line.< /Text>

They have hand wash, detailing service and more. Management keeps a close eye on things and sees to things being done right. The only car wash I've  gone to where this happens.<//text>< Pictures>

We had some really tough water spots on a black car, so I asked the manager if they could get them off.   Owner/manager said they could but it would take a little time to work on it.  Left it for the day, picked it up in the evening and it was fantastic.  Spots gone, looked like new.  No way I could have done that good that good of a job on it myself.

Had them clean up our older RV, both inside and out.  Looked great, and cost a good amount less than other places.

It helps if you let them know specifically what you need them to do if it's more then just a regular wash.  My experience with them is that they do a great job.  On my special request jobs I usually feel like they are undercharging me based on how much work the task takes.</Text>< pics>

<text>The set up is a bit weird. The inside was old and looked like the products do not get restocked and had been sitting for a while. The car is "washed" through the tunnel but not really. A guy prewashed it quickly before it going through. I'm not sure what the tunnel really did except spray water. The guy drying off the car did the best he could considering the car did not really get washed ahead of time. When the car was done, there were swirls of dirt where the guy drying the car tried to clean it up. There were still yellow drops of tree debris all over the car. The vacuuming and wiping down the inside was done nicely. However, I threw away my frequent punch card because I won't be coming back.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
The worst car wash I have ever been too... They pull the cars out so they sit in the sun and dry with spots. I still had dirt on my car.. The back windows weren't clean I had to clean them when I got home. I thought they maybe better than Canyon carwash nope canyon carwash is way better and more efficient... Sad. the worst carwash I will never go back unless its free< /Review>

Second time in row a spotty, half effort, semi dirty car wash. Exterior 6 out of 10, interior 2 out of 10. I understand it's over 100 degrees outside but if I wanted to clean my car I wouldn't go to a car wash. Should really put some effort into cleaning it. I understand I'm not buying a full detail but at least wipe the interior of dust at least once. Not happy at all waiting for an hour to wipe my own interior for 20 minutes. And I even tipped the guy $10. Shame. Do yourself a favor and just call a mobile car wash to your home for $25.< /Text>

<text>Well it wasn't the best car wash experience that I've had. It took a lot longer for my car to get washed than most places I've gone to. I think it has to do with space for parking the car to get dried off. Multiple cars are waiting in the wash tunnel because there are no spaces to move them to. And the wash itself wasn't that fantastic either. My car is definitely cleaner than it was before so that's good.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I've gone there several times always hoping for a better outcome. I always end up spending an hour cleaning up the over spray from the dressings, wiping fown missed areas, and this time I accidentally touched a tire to discover the tire shine is a black stain they spray, not just a shine.  It takes a bit of scrubing to get it off your hands.  For the price they charge I would expect better detail cleaning. I won't be bringing back my vehicles anymore.< /review>

< Review>
Fair, not great.  They were busy today (Saturday a.m.) but it was obvious that they spent more time on some vehicles - I felt they rushed through my car a bit, in general I find that most car washes don't pay attention to rims, fronts in particular where brake dust tends to build up.  The car is clean and there was no pressure or up-selling which was refreshing.  I get that sometimes this is necessary for business but I truly think that like my car, they didn't feel as if it was worth the effort.</Review>

<UserId.>108904793020800632268</UserId.><Review>I have been coming to the car wash for at least 3 years. At first I was happy because I thought they were doing there job. I started waiting for my car to come through the wash and started noticing the wax, sealer, etc., was not coming on (don't know how long this has been going on). I had to go back to the cash register to remind them so they had to put my car back through the wash. This has happened multiple times and also they forget to put the tire dressing and car scent as well. Then I have gotten an attitude from the car drying guy, instead of an apology. My advice if you take your car to the car wash don't just walk away to the waiting area; wait for your car to come by. It's it horrible that you need to babysit for them to do what you paid for. Very unhappy!!!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>i took my car for a deluxe car wash i paid
$17.99,  it says with wax and freshener, i was surprise when after 10 mins of waiting the guy was raising his rug to signal me that my car is done.   i can tell by the look of my car it is not properly washed, it is still dirty and they did not clean the back of it, there is no freshener and when i asked, a  guy told me to go back to the front and ask for the freshener, why they are classifying their car wash if they don't want to do what they are supposed to do, when i paid for what i thought will be included in the "deluxe car wash" i am pissed and will never go back there  :-(  and i will also tell my family and my friends not to go back there :-(<//Review>< rating>

(Translated by Google) Cheap, but do not try to make the car look good. The back glass was sticky and the bottom as in the trunk ran his finger and still had dust.

(Original)
Barato, pero no se esfuerzan para que el carro quede bien. Los vidrios de atrás quedaron pringosos y la parte de abajo como en la cajuela le pase el dedo y todavía le quedaba polvo.</Text>

<text>Had the work done 2 days ago and drove home. I gave a 4 🌟 Now today I drove up to SkyPark at Santa's Village and what a nice drive. They got all the squeaks fixed, Brakes work great, no pulling to the right or left. My truck is like driving on air. If they had a 10 🌟 that would be it< /text>< pics>

This place is great.  We had an issue with our windshield leaking.  They went above and beyond to repair the damage it caused.  Worked on the it all day..  the staff is super friendly, really know what they're doing and take the time to do it right.  Could not be more pleased.<//review>

I‘ve been a customer of this company mostly at the Norco location and I have always had very good, competent service and I have spent thousands over a span of more than a decade. Today I called for an oil change and was told that they could get to me within 15 minutes which was perfect. Now no matter what one’s opinion of wearing a mask to reduce the spread of Covid-19 , the facts are that if we care about each other we would not want to take the slightest chance of spreading the virus to our fellow human beings. And if a company really cares then it’s employees would wear a mask when greeting customers in the showroom. It would at least show customers that their safety is a priority. I wouldn’t necessarily expect the techs to wear a mask while working on the car. So while I really needed an oil change and trusted these guys to do it I chose to leave. I did not discuss it with the employee who was not wearing a mask. I was very disappointed.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I literally just left Mountain View tire about 5 minutes ago. I want to say thank you to the gentlemen up front who helped me with my tire pressure light concern, they checked my tires at no cost and I couldn't be more grateful. Great customer service. I can't even imagine the royal  treatment I would get it I was actually a customer .</Text>< pictures>

<review>These guys don't really care whether you drive a 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 or 2008 Mazda 5.  The work get's done right and a fair price at that!
Thank you Charles, Charlie and the MVT guys!< /review>< pics>

Mountain view tires has done a great and beyond job this morning for me, I had 3 studs holding my front passenger tire , yes I know dangerous and out of the 3 that were holding only 2 studs were good and the 3rd was crossed threaded, so been in a tuff budget for beginning of the month they had solutions but little more cost and I just couldn't but little did I know they adjusted the studs that were broken and changed  1  and other little tricks they had up there sleeve and now I have ALL 5 STUDS BACK..truely a good blessed  Saturday cant never thank them enough. God bless you guys and thanks again for sending a dangerous car going in and coming out a safe car for the road.  Now they have a loyal customer that will come back for other services they have to offer  because I know my car is in good hands.</text>

We have had our Ford Excursion, Toyota Sequoia, Chevy HHR and Nissan Altima serviced here and we cannot say enough good things about the technicians, staff and the AWESOME and quality customer service, work done on our vehicles,  honest professionalism and the follow up.

I love how they will not try to sell you anything that you do not need and always stand by their service if you have any issues later on with your vehicle that isn't even related.

I'd highly recommend having Sam, Charles and all of the guys work on your cars.  You will not be disappointed with your decision,  they'll take good care of you and your precious car:)</text>

Tony is awesome! I have a high maintenance car and showed up with a dead battery and no one else could order a battery for me (I tried 4 other places, they l said they couldn't work on a Volkswagen or it would be a day or so to order a battery) I showed up this morning all stressed out, he said no worries! He ordered it and it was here within the hour.  I will never take my car anywhere else from here in out!!!<//review>

I dropped in today not sure what was going on with my car- it was making strange noises and I needed to get back to LA to get to work ASAP. Everyone I spoke with was exceptionally helpful and friendly, they brought my car back immediately, told me exactly what was going on, and I was able to drive away much more quickly than I expected. Couldn't be happier with how the situation was handled and really appreciate the service today!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Last Sunday was just one of those days where everything is going so wrong.  When your car decided to break down on you twice in the freeway.
But luckily! This place was in the right place!
I took the nearest exit & I saw this place.Ricardo greeted me and smiled! So friendly!  they treated me so kindly, they took care of my car and helped me with prices. I’ve never been so eager to write a review just now. They truly are a hero! CHARLIE! You’re so freakin awesome thank you so much for your help and understanding! To Romeo, thank you as well!   I had a tire replacement before, it took them whole day. And mine was inspected and they made sure I’m safe. And the other friendly people!!! You guys are amazing for sure ! And will never forget my experience.  Will definitely recommend this place. And I will definitely come back ❤️ Thank you again and keep rocking guys!!!  Love the people & place ✨<//Text>< pics>

These guys quite frankly hit a home run on service. After being let down by my go-to company for tires, I drove across the street as I recalled a buddy having a great experience. Ed was a super nice guy, and while buying new high quality tires is a drain on the wallet, these guys never pressured or tried to up-sell.  I recommend them to anyone in the market for new tires!< /text>

I came in due to a flat tire yesterday, luckily I was able to drive in with my spare tire in place. A very nice gentleman named Charlie helped me out right away. They did not have the tire I needed in stock at the shop but they were able to get one quickly and install it in no time. Knowledgable and courteous staff!</text>

From John Lillywhite:  From tire replacement to engine work, I have been going to this place for years now.  Why?  Because they do excellent work!  I have NEVER been disappointed.  They understand the importance of repeat business and the power of customer satisfaction.  Top notch all the way!  I don't give accolades unless the service is stellar!!!</Review>

My daughter's Honda was overheating and I live 3,000 miles away from Corona. I found MVT by calling NAPA and asking the counter guy "where is the best repair shop in town?" They told me that this place does all kinds of repairs (not just tires) and that they were good. I called their manager, Charles, and from the get-go, he was really good. They checked my daughter's compression and found the head gasket was blown. He said that they sub out their motor rebuilds and that their shop had done hundreds of jobs for them with only 1 issue, a transmission that was replaced after it failed.
Long story short: the Honda engine was rebuilt for exactly what they said it would cost. I was in constant contact with Mountain View, who kept tabs on the rebuild shop for me and they never even charged me for the engine check! The car runs great and I don't have to worry about my kid. Thank you Charles, I'm sure my daughter will be back if she has any other problems (engine was warrantied for 6 years, so I'll bet it won't be for that!)
Update 8-3-2015 My daughter's Honda has had a couple problems since the initial engine rebuild and MV auto has looked at her car twice WITH NO CHARGE at all! They changed the oil once and fixed a rattling muffler heat guard. If you use another repair shop, you are crazy in my opinion.</review>

Took a drift trip with Tom Page on the Yuba above Marysville. Weather was horrible, cold rain and hail that was hardest I have ever fished in. Tom was great got us on some fish in horrible conditions and rowed upstream to do a drift again more times than I thought he needed to to make us happy.

Great guiding and hard worker. Will definitely go again with him.< /review>

<Text>Tom's shop, The Reel Angler, has everything you need for fly fishing the local waters around Grass Valley and then some. The best part is their customer service and their overwhelming knowledge and willingness to share it with the expert or novice walking through the door. Growing up in a fly shop and working in the industry for over 30 years I either love fly shops or leave them. I can say confidently I will be coming back and sending others here. They also have a great guide team and fish for all kinds of species.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1pAEiwSgw9vB7v__RMc09pEKIKJG8oV3pxIC7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNw4RNbpRhhhxMdYmAyoCHH1xFG16fMmO-svmt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV7xE39f7VTwVHPW9HMXlYHTepb2zXXaCIsTsI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAzSkPEtyGAnrmUYqMTMoPhX-9tARFd02bh9Z4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ_GtRvXNYJ4WKz2OJZB1TKt-tq12NAsUP7Pkw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMznFywfUqLkq5NpNy-5gFKjforFpHEhBIYk6Ri=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Unable to make an appointment online. Uploaded docs online for the Real ID. Had to also bring the docs for them to validate. Got there at 7:30 am. Waited outside in line for an hour. At 8:30 am they let me into the building where I waited another 30 minutes or so. Got my DL renewal and took a new photo and was on my merry way! I think the key is to get there EARLY, and have all your paperwork ready. Nobody wants to go to the DMV, but it sure is a popular place. Good luck! 🙄</Text>

<review>Waited for more than 5 hours just to get the permit test taken for my son. Their systems went down twice , no sympathy for all the people that stood in lines for hours and blew most of their day waiting. Employees seem devoid of emotion and empathy and are of no help.

Go to a different DMV. San Clemente has an excellent one. This one will waste your time then tell you too bad. It seems like priority is given to driver's licenses and everyone else is kept waiting without much word. They are somewhat disrespectful and advise you to stay in line even when they know they won't get to you. Absolutely terrible. This has nothing to do with the pandemic. This is just pathetic.</review>

<text>I liked that is was able to take care of what I needed with the exception that they could only do one transaction at this visit. I cannot stress this enough.  MAKE AN APPOINTMENT! Even customers that had an appointment, had to wait a long time.  I just showed up hoping for the best. I waited 2 1/2 hours! For ID/DL you must obtain a "code" and application, so don't go there without one. For how unbelievably busy they were, the staff were very friendly and helpful.<//text></record>

Good experience for DMV staff but a male examiner. We parked the car on the side of road to have a short break before the driver test. After a few minutes, he parked the car behind us and honked the horn and came to impolitely ask us to move the car probably because we pulled over the car on the driver test routes(it’s public place, there are lots of cars parked right there and I didn’t realize we were on the routes at that time). Once I asked him reasons behind it every time, he just interrupted me and shouted out “move!understand? I don’t want you to practice, move! Just move!” Also, he didn’t give us any reasons but tried to record our license plate. Although we don’t know if there is restrictions or laws of using the driver test routes during the DMV hours, I know he needs to learn how to communicate with others respectably.< /Text>

<review>Booked an appointment, filled an online form to get a 8 digit confirmation number and took it with me. Was out of the DMV in less than 40 minutes. The staff is being their best in such unprecedented times. They deserve much more appreciation than they get. The process has evolved so much that I do not dread going for an in person visit anymore.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Unbelievably terrible! I did everything online before arriving so I can go through the express line. When I got to the DMV in the morning, the express line was already very long. I waited in line for 2 1/2 hours not moving at all before deciding to leave. I watched as the first person in the express line didn’t move either. What’s the point of having an express line if it’s not going to be at all. This was totally ridiculous and unacceptable! Bad service! If I didn’t have to go there, I wouldn’t. Hopefully these people can get a better system together that helps serve people better.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>There is poor communication between the examination staff and the door monitors at Laguna Hills DMV. People are lined up outside and not organized by type of service needed. So, the no appointment line could look shorter than the appointment line. I was there to get my Real ID. l had  stepped out to get my eyeglasses for the vision test. The examiner gave me instructions to be allowed back in for the vision test. Both the door man/scheduler and the guard glanced at my note and would not let me back in, citing some rule that one was not allowed to see the same examiner.  I was told to start back in line. By that time I was already there for 1 1/2 hours. I pleaded to have my eye test. The examiner who gave my vision  test was very sympathetic and i got my license.

Be prepared to wait. Bring water and a snack. Bring your eyeglasses.<//review><UserId.>117624530496984843482<//UserId.>< rating>

The staff was very pushy and kind of ignorant. I have a disability with my right leg and they didn't even let me sit down to fill out my application for a new ID. They had a disability chair available but made me stand because they said it was for people with a disability. I said I have a disability and they didn't even help me. I recommend going to the San Clemente DMV it's a lot faster and the staff is very very nice.</Text>

You can't expect a hotel experience in a DMV,  but for a DMV it's a pleasant place. Maybe it's because it was in a nice neighborhood, I don't know. Nice people and the building is not falling apart. All covid-19 caution is in effect.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

There is a lovely fun lady who works the queue at the front, she’s pleasant and smiling, insanely helpful.

Then there is the Customer Service lady who’s name is Lan, who also works the front queue.

Lan hates people, she hates being helpful, she hates giving service.

Things Lan enjoys....being dismissive, being rude, being unhelpful, being disrespectful to the elderly.

Thanks for making my trip to the DMV 10X harder than it had to be, simply because you hate your job.< /review>

Arrived 8:20am (opens at 9) to get a spot with 50 people ahead of me.  By 10:00am I was done with DL, title, registration and plates.  Not a bad experience at all.  Most of paperwork to arrive in mail within couple weeks, but temporary items are in hand.</Review>

Go after 3:30 , 4 is even better for much shorter lines and quicker service. Don't push it though, some services aren't offered after a certain time so check first.<//Text>

Worst service ever! Their workflow is not efficient.  California DMV needs to step up to improve your workflow, please.  After all, it’s our tax money to pay your salary.</Text>

Thank you to the gentleman and security guard outside making sure people are in the right lines because it can get confusing.

The whole process took about an hour but considering there are no appointments other than behind the wheel tests, that’s pretty good, especially in a pandemic. If you have all your paperwork ready to go, you will save yourself lots of time and a headache.<//Review>< userid>

Came down here because I read that it was less crowded than most in OC. I drove by mine, Westminster, and by comparison, LH had a line that was about twice as long. I guess everyone else heard the same.

Oh well I was already here. Arrived around 2:15 and saw a group of about 20 people go in. That was the only time I saw the line move. There was still 30-35 people in front of me and the line continued to grow behind me.

Finally, about 3:30 a worker came out, got on a loud speaker and announced to the remainder of us that we probably wouldn't be seen.

So, since this is the 3rd time I've been turned away, am I going to be excused or exempt from the late charges because I physically can't stand in line very long? Doubtful.

Wanna know the best way to screw something up? Make it a government office  (I know, it always has been. If I could've handled this complicated mess at AAA I would have).

Sorry, LH DMV. Fail.</text>

Complete disgrace for a Government Agency!   I was active duty military for 23...... and the service I received there.... at times mediocre...... blows this place away!    No appointments..... using COVID as an EXCUSE!!!   Schools and business are opened ..... but this place is half staffed!   I had to show up in person because I was titling/ registering a vehicle I purchased out Of state..... or would have gladly did everything online!!  From when I arrived..... stood in the long line..... to completion...... FIVE (5) HOURS!!!!!
Staff was rude and felt like you’re bothering them if asking them a question!!!!    Doesn’t our tax dollars pay these losers!!???</Text>

<Time>1598675563503</Time><review>After having read the reviews, I was expecting the worse...

First, do not trust the waiting time estimates on their website. Without any appointment (which you can't book at this time), you will have to queue for 3 to 4 hours. Do not come in the afternoon, there is little chance you will get in.

I agree that, especially with this pandemic, they should control the crowds by doing appointment only instead of having people standing in line in the heat for hours. The DMV managers should rethink their system, for sure.

Having said that, I arrived at 6AM to start queuing, there were already 50 people or so. I got in at 9AM, passed the written test, booked a behind-the-wheel test directly after, and got my driver license in the afternoon. I don't know of any other country where you could get your driver license in a day.

Everyone at the DMV was nice and helpful, patient and arranging. I understand that people get angry when they get told to go at the end of the line to do simple administrative tasks, but it's not the employees fault. Contact whoever is in charge of this mess, but don't curse at the employees who are also spending their day outside in the heat.<//review><rate>4</rate>< Pics>

I specifically booked an appointment at 2:00 pm and yet I still had to wait in line, what's the point of the reservation then?
This place also seems to be very disorganized and the service here is very slow.</review>

JUST MAKE AN APPOINTMENT!! For any process that can be started online,  do it. I loaded all my documents online for a license renewal/Real ID. I showed up at 9am and went to the appointment line. My documents were verified and my number assigned. I waited about 30 seconds inside for my number to be called. I immediately went to the window and my application was processed, documents verified again, fees paid. I then took my photo...waited in a line to have my temporary card printed. I was back in my car before 930am. ***Make sure you bring hand sanitizer as you all use the same pens and you take your mask on/off for photos.</Review>

Employees are excellent and exceptionally tolerant of a few entitled individuals who show up (like the man who claimed if he had to wait in line it would be a human rights violation, in front of us that all just waited for 2 hours).  That said, State could majorly overall the technology of this system to reduce the process.

For reference.  I needed RealID.  I showed up at 7:45am, not realizing Wednesdays open at 9, not 8.  I was entirely done by 10:50am.< /text>

Nice organized, but there should be longer hours possible two shifts to accommodate number of the individuals.  Register the people as they come. Give them Number and let them wait in their car or nearby . Call them on the  phone when their turn comes !!! That will avoid heat in the afternoon.  People will be Cool , not exhausted or angry.!!!!!< /review>

The worst DMV! I spent 6 hours on a line under the sun on a 95 degree heat, for an employee to make a mistake in payment system. Went in to pay tags and get new plates. Walked out empty handed, because of a negligent employee. They had me come back next day because of their stupidity. Don’t go there! Sucks!<//Text>

They are doing a great job with all of that is going on and having to fly by the seat of their pants.  I. Would have been a 5 star but some of the employees had less than good customer service. Permit desk threw paperwork at us.  The driving instructor scolded us for having old registration in packet even though it was put there by them. Only recommendation would have a senior citizen sitting area we had some 90 year olds who struggled.
Thank you for all your doing.</text>

It took me just under 4 hours from start to finish to renew my license. Initially, the line seemed jaw dropping, but it moved fairly quickly. Once inside everthing moved well. Covid and all things considered, I hopped it would have been less time but it could have been worse.<//review>

<Review>I made an appointment for a real ID application and uploaded all of my documents online. I was told to come to the express line via email and to my surprise the DMV had no such line in place. Now I'm standing in this 200 person line because the lack of leadership at this location. In fact, the attitude at this DMV is "F.U." I tried asking William(Asian man), who is a " Field Representative " at this office, but instead of responding professionally he began to yell at me and other customers who were trying to get answers to the very clear discrepancies in the direction at this location. William embodies everything that is wrong with this DMV. He doesn't care. He's disrespectful.  He thinks he's not accountable to anyone because he's a DMV scrub. I asked the fake security guard (she's blonde and her uniform looked unsatisfactory) about the lines and she was not helpful at all. This DMV should be avoided at all costs, especially if you live close enough to another one to make the drive. This DMV is a perfect example of why people dislike the DMV. Not professional at all. William and the Security guard should be fired.< /Review>< pictures>

Bad, they send you to a long line that is 3 hours waiting or more, with 80 degree temperature outside. The line don't move, they assist one person every hour, that's the reason you are outside for hours with the line don't even moving. And is not guarantee they will serve you if the closing time come. Basically you can stand on the line for hours and they don't care, they just going to close the door on you. Bad service and rude people. You can't get an appointment online because the website don't let you.. This institution should be manage by a private institution or they should hire people that do their work better.< /Review>

The entire setup is extremely confusing. I walked up to an attendant to obtain guidance on which line I should wait in before waisting my time in the wrong line. The representative (tall African American Male) was extremely condescending, and pointed me to the right line. Before, I got a chance to say, “thank you” he said, “you’re welcome” he did not have to be rude, and assume I would not use my manners. I elaborated and told him, he didn’t have to be rude, and walked away. Customers in the lines were more pleasant than this representative. Times are very difficult, and stressful as they are.. it would help if personal at least pretended to like their job. I understand some people are rude but I was very pleasant when I requested for assistance.</review>

<review>What an absolute joke. Stood outside for an hour and half for an "express experience" to get my real ID. They closed at 5pm. No one even came out to tell the 20 people standing outside that they're closed. Nothing. Maybe tell us at 4pm that we're not going to get in or something? Jesus. If there was any competition, they'd be out of business. Don't come here.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dce87e8cfd0a97:0xc47c2586563974a8<//gmapID></record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I arrived on a Thursday morning at 5:45am to get in line fairly early by 6:00am (recommended by a friend).  I was the 3rd person there (it was cold waiting outside so bring a warm jacket).  We were let in slightly before 7:00am and the two ladies in the front were very helpful and courteous.  I was renewing my license/New Real ID.  I had all my paperwork ready to go per the checklist found online.  Only Cash, Checks, or Debit Card accepted (no Credit Cards).  I was done within 30 minutes!  Everyone behind the counter that I dealt with was very friendly.  Do yourself a favor and get there early in the event you didn't get an appointment like me.  Good luck.< /text>< date>

2 stars is generous for this place.  The workers seem to be over worked and irritated by the people coming to do DMV stuff.  I don’t blame them.  There must be a better system for people to get through the lines and do a majority of the stuff online so they don’t have to wait forever in line.  It would be helpful if they had people taking food and drink orders for those of us who need to eat.  I get hungry sometimes.  Especially when my number is so far away from being called.  Ugh</review>

Went there to get my Real ID. I did the application online, and the instructions said to go to the DMV appointment line.

When I arrived and went to the appointment line, a worker told me Real ID applications no longer count as appointments, so I had to wait in the non-appointment line. What a waste of time.

The guy said they stopped taking Real ID appointments since COVID started, which is a lie (just read the other reviews here; plus my girlfriend did the Real ID appointment successfully just a week ago). When I asked them to confirm that the DMV-provided instructions I was holding were incorrect, they told me "I can write my congressman".

In my life, I've wanted to punch someone in the face maybe twice total. Today was one of the those times.<//Review>

Relatively Painless Experience. It took about an hour and a half in and out the door. I arrived around 8:00 am and left just short of 9:30 am. My drivers license was not expired but, I was here to change my current drivers license to a Real ID drivers license.  They took a new photo for the new ID. I would recommend filling out the online application before coming to the DMV, and write down your confirmation number on a paper in case your trusty phone dies while you are at the DMV.</review>

DMV location with seasonal manager on staff. Horrible experience! Manager Timothy advised me that the information on the official dmv website Is outdated. And the appointment confirmation on my printed page is incorrect because dmv does not have time to update their website so I have to get in the line with everyone else because of that misleading information on the official dmv website. I wish I can file a complaint agains dmv that actually would change something.<//Text>

<Text>Covid delay can cause long wait times, arrive at 3am to 4am to get to the front line...at least until they start allowing appointments again...yes, bring a lawn chair.

Overheard that they normally processed around 1,500 people a day before the Covid; but now, with the Covid-19, processing less than 300 per day...so you guessed it...almost 200 people lined up to get in at 8am when they opened.

DMV office well organized, employees were polite and surprisingly good natured in spite of all the extra work involved to get everyone processed.< /Text>< gmap_id>

EVERYONE WORKING AT THIS LOCATION IS RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL. If you want to be treated like a human being do not come to this location. Waiting in line, everyone was confused because all the employees do is yell orders and it forces people to ask questions to one another. I had to help a foreign man fill out an application for his license because the lady working and patrolling the lines was ignoring him. If I could rate the experience it would be a 0/10<//Review>

I went to this DMV office three times for my Real ID and Driver License renewal. Nothing was done.  Totally waste of time.
Very disappointed with their service. Not organized, extremely slow. Nobody tells you what to do or how long of the wait. Bad attitude, Poor service.<//text>

<review>Please avoid the Laguna Hills DMV during COVID! My husband and I went to get our real IDs and had filled out all our info online. When we got there, there was no clear direction which line to go to when we arrived and were ignored and avoided by DMV workers. On our paper work we were asked to wait in the appointment line, after waiting an hour and being asked to set aside to wait for no explained reason by a short blonde haired woman, working the appointment desk around 3:00 PM on August 14th. We witnessed continuous mistreatment of people that had been waiting for hours. For example, blonde security guard working at 3:00 PM on August, intentionally bullying a mother and daughter who had been waiting for over 4 hours, she even made comments to a man next to us in line about how she wouldn’t waste using force on them. After waiting on the side of the line for 30+ minutes, there was an application DMV worker shift change and an Asian man took over for the women. He then told us to go to the other line which was around a 3 hour wait. Unfortunately, we were unable to due so as I am 6 months pregnant and was physically unable to wait outside in the sun any longer. This DMV experience was dehumanizing. I watched people be treated like cattle and continuously disrespected or ignored by staff. The Laguna Hills DMV used to be a place I preferred to go because it was organized, but after today I would not recommend it to anyone.<//review>< pictures>

Star rating is based off of my experiences with other DMV locations in all States.

Ample seating and parking available.

No line to get in the front door, walk in.

So far, so good considering.<//Text>

<text>Alright, to give all the DMV people some credit, I’ll share my very positive experience here. I booked an appointment last year in Nov, and got scheduled for today Feb 21. I had applied for a 1st time CA DL. My appointment was at 3:40pm, I arrived at 3:38. A very friendly woman at the entrance was managing all new arrivals, and asked me what I wanted to do, checked my scheduled appointment and gave me my number. After my documents got checked - took me 10’ lining up - I got directly to the counter with my  scheduled appointment. The gentlemen behind the counter was not overwhelmingly friendly, but did his job efficiently. After about 15’ and felt 1000 scans and copies of my documents and my eye exam, I got a receipt to get my photo taken and the driving test done. I lined up another 15’ for this, took the test on a computer, took another 20’ for 36 questions, and then filed my passed exam document. Waited maybe another 5’ for my provisory license. The gentlemen running that process were both very friendly and helped me through the process. Both, plus the security guard at the entrance wished me a pleasant weekend when I left 5.05pm. Overall 1h 25’ for the whole thing, and people are friendly when you are friendly to them. So easy.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dce87e8cfd0a97:0xc47c2586563974a8< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

AFTER ALMOST 1 year i am here again today for a VIN VERIFICATION .... you have to open the Hood to let the Instructors know you meed a vin-verification..... the 1st instructor was blaming me for being literally 3 foots too far from the car.

It’s usually a hit or miss for any government office, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic.  Poor signage placement promoted confusion to multiple queues.  Yesterday, the screeners seem to advocate online services without thoroughly listening to needs of client. I have to go to another field office to obtain a printed temporary CDL for a lost card.  I give it a 3 stars to average out the experience from past visits.<//text>

<text>I want to this DMV office today to get a temporary handicap placard.  What a great visit!!  I was able to use the handicap entrance so I did get in a little quicker than waiting in the regular line.  They opened at 9:00 and I got there about 9:05.  There was barely any regular line at all.  I got in and out in 1/2 hour.  They had three receptionists at the desks and I saw two more walking in the line checking people in.  Both of the employees I dealt with were welcoming, friendly and knowledgable. I wish I would have gotten their names but I didn't.  When I left, there was no line outside and there were only about 10 people in the line inside.  All in all, an amazing experience!!< /text>< gmapID>

Hey, guys, I must say I am so surprised for the good! When I asked Google to find near DMV I saw 2 stars and I expected to have worse service. But I've got the opposite experience. I went to window 13 and there was Terri, what a lovely lady! She was friendly and patient! She answered all my questions and help me to fill my forms. She definitely saved me time and headaches. Terri, thank you so much for your great service.<//Text>

I was joking with the guy in line next to me that all DMVs have less than stellar ratings but after my experience today I thought I'd leave a rating of my mostly positive experience. First, 5 stars for Christine (Christina?), the lady at door. Her kindness made my day.  I wanted to thank her on the way out but she was helping another customer. The whole process took about 2.5 hrs, which is long, but I had low expectations going into the situation. I needed to renew my ID including a name change as well as submit Real ID paperwork. I filled out the forms online and was able to make an appointment. Unfortunately, the appointment was a few weeks after my due date and I did not want to bring a newborn to the DMV. So, I decided to brave the lines and wait. It took maybe an hour to get in, an hour to get served, and 30 minutes at the window. I took off one star because the guy at my window was really unprepared. He couldn't find the key to the cash drawer then he didn't have change. He had taken over for someone that had gone on a break and didn't seem quite ready to start processing paperwork. REMEMBER: cash, check, or debit only. I recommend exact change. The sound system is sort of broken, so windows one and twenty one often read as "one" over the loud speaker. Consequently, several people kept coming over to window one while I was being served, interrupting the guy helping me out. The DMV in general could use an update of its computer system.

Tips for DMV survival:
•Fill out forms online
•Have your documents accessible and ready.
•Be prepared to wait. Everyone else has somewhere to be too.
•Be kind. I heard people asking the same questions over and over. Don't take out your anger on the employees because you didn't read what was required ahead of time.
•Appointments: Meh, you have to wait in line outside regardless. You'll get served faster once you're in but you still have to wait. Appointments aren't a fast pass. You've been warned.
•The DMV needs a revamp from the top down. I couldn't make an appointment without filling out the online forms first but that wasn't posted anywhere. The next appointment was nearly 3 months out. The workers at the window are working with the same system. It just sucks.
•Bring a book or some kind of entertainment.< /text>

<text>I visited this place this morning before 7:00am, there were more them 20 people already lined up for the office open, it was cold to stand there, nicely , the staff started to pass the number 15 minutes before 7:00am, and let us get in, well organized, first to sign in with terminal, then waiting for the staff to call your number, it took an hour to complete the driver license renewal , plus the Real ID check, in additional to the computer driving test, it was a surprise to me for the good service.</text>< Gmap_id>

<date>1539725431251< /date><text>I took my 72 year old mom here to get her license on Monday 10/15 around 9:20am, and while her English is pretty good I still wanted to be sure she got through everything because I know the DMV can be overwhelming. We made an appointment  online (WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND). I had also filled out her application online ahead of time as well. If you don't, they will have you go to the computers in the back and fill it out first vs on paper. The guy at the desk was really nice and inviting which made the nerve-wracking experience start off nice.  We got our number and right away they called my mom up to the counter. We went to counter 22 and the lady there was extremely helpful and kind. She made my mom feel comfortable and was helpful and patient. When we went to the photo area, the lady right away asked how my mom was, and made some nice conversation with her. It made me feel so good to have my mom being treated so well. She was extremely nervous and was able to pass the test! I know it's easy to complain but I really wanted to give the people we met credit for our experience and hope that there can be more patience for the elderly trying to go through this already overwhelming experience.<//text>< name>

<review>Went today. Walk-in for new Real ID. Arrived 8am, left all done 9:15am. Efficient process. They had three staff members walking around to answer questions and help out with everything. They have like 10 computers for filling out applications in a very efficient process.
I wish DMV in general (not applicable to this one office) had more availability for scheduled appointments... soonest available one is 3 months away!. Don't get it... if they are taking care of walk-ins anyway, they might as well use same resources for scheduled visits</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I dreaded and put off going to the DMV to get a Real ID for almost a year because of everyone's incredibly negative reviews. Personally, my experience was great! I went on a Friday afternoon at 1:15pm and was out at 3:00pm. I had to wait in line a bit and then once I got my first ticket # I had to sit waiting ~40mins longer, take the written test, photo, etc., and all 5 DMV workers I interacted with were great. They were friendly, helped clarify any questions, and did their jobs efficiently.

This is a DMV. You know you have to wait in line. You know it won't be a fun afternoon. No DMV is going to be a perfect experience filled with unicorns and sunshine, so I really don't understand why so many people leave a terrible review for the exact thing they know they're walking into? Maybe I just got lucky, but I don't think it is a coincidence that every person/station I interacted with was great. I would give this DMV a shot! Don't listen to the 2/5 star reviews!</review>

Was told that If I choose to test next time, I will be able to go straight to the appointment line and checked in right away for test. The truth is I will need to wait for 40+ mins to just have me checked in and then get my test done. The information was misleading at best. If I know I need to wait that long, I will just choose to test on the day of application.</Text>

Best SoCal DMV I've ever been to. I've been there a dozen times for various things over the last 3 years. This last time really impressed me - I went in to get a new RealID DL, and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. When I got there, the check in people were right at the door, and I didn't have to wait in line for hours just to get a number. The document check line had a helper to ensure your documents were in order before getting to the desk. After I got checked, I barely had enough time to pee before my number was called.

Compare this to the Oceanside DMV where I have tried to go twice in the last 3 years and each time waited more than 45 without the line even moving.<//Review>

Women at check in were delightful and very helpful. The lady at the license section was rude though.... Either way they helped me get things done easily and I was in and out faster than expected.<//review>

<Review>It took 3 hours to renew my license, and the bathroom looked and smelled so dirty that I gagged and had to breathe through my mouth. HOWEVER, the staff were all good and efficient. That’s the only reason why I gave my visit 3 stars. I went first thing in the morning. I suggest going later in the morning. Even though you have to wait some for your number to get called if you go later, the wait to get a number isn’t as long as if you go first thing in the morning.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dce87e8cfd0a97:0xc47c2586563974a8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I would have given five stars, but hey nobody’s perfect! I was very impressed with the personable service, attention to detail and even tips on being more photogenic (chin down for guys, chin up for women) or was it the other way around? The point is they connected with me as a living breathing person and not as something to process! Thanks to Susan and all for making my 90 minutes there an a-typical dmv experience.</Review>

I could not see any available appointments online so decided to do the usual show up well early for less wait. I arrived at 6.40am and only had 10-15 people in front of me. At 7.30am, the Starbucks next door came around too give everyone little samples of coffee and donuts. At 7.45am, the staff started organizing us between people here for driving licence and registrations. Those of us here for DL matter were let into the building and given directions to make things go faster once the windows were open. My recommendation: do the online application ahead of time. I went from 15th in line to 3rd in line! It was a long wait before opening but things are run smoothly once it opens.

I also got to experience great customer service. Still half asleep when I left, I absentmindedly forgot ALL MY DOCUMENTS on the bench when my ride arrived.  I only realized later than evening (it’s was Friday) and was worried all weekend. I received a piece of mail on Monday from the DMV with one of my documents and a little notes that said to come pick up the rest. Showed up, showed some ID and got all my documents back!<//Review>

<Review>Car registration + driver's license: total 2  hours with appointment. Most of that time was spent waiting for the car to be inspected. After that everything was pretty snappy, staff polite and professional. Separate line for people with appointments and disabilities.

Axed a star as the nearest available appointment was 3 months out.< /Review>< Pics>

Had a 3:30 appointment for an out of state vehicle registration and verification. I don’t remember the name of the employee working window 19, which was my window I was being served at, but by far he was the most professional DMV employee I’ve ever interacted with. Was in and out under an hour on a Friday afternoon.<//Text>

We’re new CA residents and couldn’t get an appointment until June so arrived an hour before opening only to find a line wrapping around the building. Incredible lack of organization. We’ve now been here over 6 hours and still waiting to have our number called. They need a better system to allow us to comply with rules requiring drivers license and registration within 10 days of becoming residents. People can’t be expected to take entire days off work to spend at the DMV!</Review>

I sat at this DMV from 7:30 am until 5 in the evening to replace my license. It took until 9:30 to get inside and get a number then the rest of the time was waiting for my number to be called. There was not enough seating so I had to sit on the ground, of the 20 some odd service windows 9 were closed, and the restrooms have a single stall. Thankfully the gentleman who helped me was nice (other people were not that lucky).  I will use another DMV in the future.< /text>

Thank you DMV staff for your dedication and helping and accommodating us. Staff stayed past 5pm to finish everyone. I thought that was sooo sweet and cool! 👍🏼

Staff is doing the best they can, although some are not the nicest. but hey the fact that they stayed to finish everyone that was waiting was simply AWESOME ❤️

if your planning on going without appointment any DMV you go it will be a whole day, so be mentally prepared for it. bring water and a snack, bring a book, do errands online while waiting👍🏼 you can be productive while waiting but it will be all day👍🏼</review>

Came in during the afternoon (with the usual wait to be helped)  and the clerk (short black hair, glasses, older woman, window 15) refused to provide our registration service because "it was too late" but tried to take $200 from us. She was completely clueless on the process and rude because she was trying to leave at 5:05pm (I'm sure they are required to help if you are inside before the close the doors). Who hasn't been held up at work by 5mins?? Very frustrating visit when we are new to the neighborhood. Looking forward to visiting a more competent office to take care of a simple task!<//review>

This place blows the Westminster DMV out of the water!

Yea, it’s the dmv. It’s never gonna get 5 stars in my book.  But here it felt much more organized then other dmv’s I have been to. The staff actually seems to care about the folks that come in the door.

To be in and out, w/appointment in 70 minutes. Pretty impressive for a behind the wheel test.

Also, people here seem to be polite. That’s something you do not see at other dmvs.  Employees and Customers.

Also, you can see outside. There are windows.
Doesn’t feel like a dungeon.

This is as close to a 5 star DMV that can exist.< /text>

With an appointment, despite the DMV being extremely busy, I had a wonderful experience.  Do your research online and bring the right documents - also recommend an appointment first in the morning.  Still had to do smog check since transferring from another state.  Also needed power of attorney since car is leased from another state.  Was able to drop finalized documents in drop box so I didn't have to wait a second time when returning with remaining documents.< /review>

We went to the Laguna DMV today for New CA Resident Real IDs for 2 people and VIN Verification and Car Registration. We arrived at 8:30 am WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT and it took about 5 hours WHICH INCLUDED 2 trips back home to get the correct documents for myself (both times my fault), and my husband leaving again to get a SMOG check and another time the computer system went down for a moment and restarted the systems. Had we had all the paperwork needed for the IDs and SMOG check completed, I believe we would have been out of there in less than 3 hours. Which I think is great for 4 out of state items. Each time I had to leave, I was asked to return to a special line "between the orange flags" and did not have to re-wait in the long lines.

Everyone that I encountered was pleasant. I want to give a shout out to ***Ms. TERRI *** She was very patient with me and greeted me with a smile every time I had to leave and come back with more information.

TIPS FOR VISITORS
1. Arrive Early!!!
When I arrived at 8:30am/Monday there were 3 employees working at the check-in desk and one person in front of me. When I left and came back at 9am-ish, 2 of the employees had been pulled away from the desk and reassigned to other stations leaving only 1 employee at the check-in desk for many hours. By 12pm the line was OUT THE DOOR and up the walk way!!!

2. Eat something before you arrive and/or bring clean eating snacks.
You are going to have to wait. It is just how it is and getting the "hangries" is not going to make the experience anymore pleasant and will not make the visit go by faster.

3. Be careful how much you drink and bring Poopouri Spray
There is only 1 toilet in the Lady's Room (I do not know about the Men's Room). The line can get long and the room can get unpleasant.

4. Read over the California Driver's Handbook while you wait
SURPRISE!!! There is a Q&A drivers test as part of the application process.<//text>

<Text>Horrible service. The agent gave me the wrong phone for the CHP inspection. When I tried to call, it said "number out of service". Thanks a lot guys, especially considering I couldn't register my vehicle without scheduling an VIN inspection from the CHP which takes "weeks" to get, yet they only gave me a 30 day moving permit. The two guys inspecting my vehicle didn't even try to find my VIN which was clearly located above the windshield. Totally incompetent service, I'm shocked that these employees still have the jobs considering how many mistakes they made in a day. Please save yourself the trouble and go to San Clemente DMV.< /Text>< time>

<review>The lines are outside and a long wait but if more DMV’s were opened in this area ir the DMV was bigger, problem solved. But it is clean and I don’t feel like I’m as likely to catch something from another person. I can breath a little more comfortably. But hold your breath in the doctors office!

<date>1556159255958< /date><review>This is the worst place of public service that I ever seen. I made an appointment and with the appointment we had to wait 3.5 hours to get to the renewal test. People are rounding around the block. Most of the workers are half a sleep and the service is arrogant and unpleasant. When I finally got to do my test I was exhausted, didn't see in my eyes and failed the test. Since then I was out of town and it's almost a year and the trauma is still on. I am 74 years old and shouldn't go through that.</review>< username>

It took 3 hours to just get a ticket. Then I was seen only at 4:30pm!!! Changed my name, applied for real ID and got a temporary paper. The actual driver's license took almost 2 month to arrive, and guess what? It expired in February!!! Why am I getting a driver's license for 4 month? I paid $45 for what??? Why??? I'm not on a Visa, I'm a citizen! I don't have any restrictions or anything... I tried to review online and it doesn't allow me to renew online! Again, why? Next appointment is not until June! I have work and school I can't keep going to DMV every other month and spend all day on a weekday to get my driver's license! Not to say about paying $45 every time? This is beyond rediculous.<//text>< time>

This place sucks.  Been here for 5 hours already and my number is G098 AND they are only up to like G043.  AM I ever going to be seen?  They close at 5pm.  Help.  No chairs, long lines, not enough staff to handle the volume of people.  People are squeezed in here like sardines.  What do they do if they don't get up to your number?</Text>

<Review>Honestly thought it would be another nightmare like it was when I was here 4 years ago. This location has a smooth routine. Monday morning arrived about 9:30am, left at noon. Did not feel like I was waiting for as long as I did. There was only 1 camera working for pictures so this slowed the process. This was for a license renewal to get the REAL ID. You must bring 2 forms of identification and proof of residency. I brought snn card, birth certificate, vehicle registration with current address and a medical bill with current address because my ID did not have my current address.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I been coming here for 18 years plus , everyone is helpful and nice until my experience today , the guy on window 5 needs to learn more about the rules Instead of just telling people  they don’t do something they do . Also some customer services and manners would be good skills for his job,  is not like he is working for free , for him to treat people without respect very sad 😔.</review><time>1524704392573</time><rating>1<//rating>< user_id>

Why does the scale start with a number as high as one star? This place showed everything wrong in an over taxed state with terrible services.  I had to wait for a half an hour WITH AN APPOINTMENT and the website says 0 minutes wait. How about we take some money from the slow speed, crazy train to nowhere & get some more efficient staff and streamlined processes.<//text>

<review>New resident. Never been to this DMV before. Tried to make an appointment, but they were booked until 7 weeks from now. They open at 8, was there at 8:15. Looked to be about 100 people in line outside. Again, I've never been here to know how it is once you're inside, etc. It took over 3 hours just to get inside the building, with a total time of OVER 7 HOURS! How does this happen?! The employees were actually nice and everything, but I don't understand how it possibly took so long. I felt terrible for the older people in there. Some were diabetic. No one was planning on 7+ hours, so it's not like everyone had a stash of food and drinks or anything if someone would need it.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dce87e8cfd0a97:0xc47c2586563974a8</gmap_id></record>

With an appointment, it took me an hour to take my written test, eye test, photo and fingerprint. Most of that time was spent standing in line. So why a 5 if it took so long? Well the reason it took so long was that most people coming in were unprepared. They hadn't looked up what was needed to accomplish their goal. Then the people working there took the time to explain what was needed and assisted them with their goal. The DMV employees were intelligent, helpful and nice. The public, not so much.</text>

<Review>Traumatizing. Appalled by humanity from some of the staff. The young lady taking photos did a little evil smirk upon seeing it on the screen and said “you can go”. License comes and the picture shows me blinking. How miserable does she have to be to be so mean to a stranger...? Overall very slow with mean drivers tests staff.

THE LAGUNA HILLS DMV IS CLOSED ON WED, 6/12/19!!! They should have posted an update on the DMV website. Instead, there is a guy standing outside shouting that this DMV is closed and advising that we go to Santa Ana or San Clemente. Now here I am at 9:12am, lining up outside at the San Clemente DMV. Hopefully, this post saves someone the trouble of going to the Laguna DMV on 6/12/19.<//review>

<Text>The WORST Dmv I've ever been to. With an appointment waited 3 hours and at the end was met with a staff member who was rude, dismissive, and patronizing.

The staff mostly not knowledgeable to direct you property and don’t know what they are doing!!
I went there three times and it’s a really crowded DMV because of unprofessional staffs. Last time I went there to take one part of my test and the lady behind the counter did not put my number in the system so the computer was not able to find me I ask her for help she went to front and told me your number is not appear on the monitor yet keep your eyes on monitor and after 30 minutes I didn’t see my class number that was c is not appearing at all so I went to the front again and ask the staff why you’re not putting class c numbers on monitor? She checked my number and told me your number is passed!! And gave another class C number I sit there for more 30 minutes and I see that they are not putting class C again and just waiting my time so I decided to go to other DMV to do my test instead of this location that obviously the staff are not respecting people’s time.
The other thing happened to me was I went to Costa Mesa dmv and finished my test and when I passed test they said your medical document is not in the system!! And again I got problem because the staff in this location are terribly unprofessional and they don’t know anything! I came back to them and described the situation and they waste my time and money again and they didn’t even apologize to me for their lots of mistakes!!!!!!!<//Review>

I was there today at 1:00 pm Monday, October 1, 2018. The serviced Is really bad! Waited for 4 1/2 hours and the customer service at window 8 was really rude and she didn’t answer my questions. She wasn’t even try to read the papers I gave her. She said just go to the court or mail it. I told her but she need to sign the paper from DMV to prove that I have a car registration, that’s the main reason why I’m here but she didn’t. Not professional. If I could give zero for this rating I would.< /Text>

I usually don't post reviews but I felt I needed too. First let me say the workers are very polite and accommodating and it's a nice DMV. I usually never schedule appointments with the dmv but for this location you need to do so. I got to the there early on a Friday at 7:45 a.m. to renew my vehicle registration and wasn't seen until 2:30 p.m.. Once seen it was quick and efficient but the wait was insane. They also have a new system where they take your initials and last 4 digits of your cell number and that's your number. Before it was a number given to you and you could kinda gauge how long you had if your number was A12 and A05 was last called. Now you have no idea. Definitely sucks. Again nothing wrong with the employees but the system they have in place is not working. Plan ahead and make an appointment, your life will be much easier. 2 stars only for the cleanliness of the location and employee's.</text>

They stated online approximate wait times were about 30 minutes. I arrive and find a huge line wrapping around the building! It took 3 hours to finally get a number and then another 45 minutes to finally see a clerk!!!! I don't blame the people working I blame the system! But I mean at least they could have accurate wait times online!!!</Text>

25 min!! I was shocked how quick it was to renew my license.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  It is so key to make an appointment.  I have tried showing up early in the past and it will still take me a minimum of 3 hours to get through the line.  Thanks Laguna Hills DMV!!  Never thought I would have a good experience at the DMV.<//text>

Each time first available appointment is months away. Then when you show up at your "appointment", you still have to wait hours! I am not sure they understand the concept of "appointment"</text>

This place have always been a good experience for me. As I am disabled they help to make the process easier and quicker, even though there is a DMV lock on my license. Ryan is by far the best employee I have come across over the years. He was extremely helpful and went the extra mile to help.

Recommendation? Make an appointment and research what you need to bring as your responsible for that, not them. If you don't want to do either be ready to wait 2 to 3 hours to be told you don't have the right items then go home and blame yourself. Sorry to be blunt.< /Text>

Earliest appointments will be available atleast 6 weeks after from the current date. I felt the staff is helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Haven't made an appointment as my DL is expiring. So walked in to the DMV and stood in line since 6.30 am and got serviced at 8.35am. There were 16 people ahead of me who started to stand in line since 4.30 am. I have given my knowledge exam and was done with it by 10.05 am.</text>

People who have bad reviews of this DMV are people with poor attitudes and a sense of entitlement.  If you make an appointment with them you will be in and out in no time.   I arrived for my appointment on time and was out of there in less then 30 minutes and treated very well.   Everyone who works there is very nice and they have to deal with frustrated and impatient people who walk in expecting things to go fast.   Make an appointment folks and if you treat others as you would like to be treated that is exactly what you will get.     I will be using this DMV for all of my future DMV appointments for sure.< /review>

Rudest, staff. With all the correct documentation do not expect that you will be able to process your request, even when you are given a number and assured that all your paperwork is in order.  As tax payers still unsure why we accept this level of abuse from people who are meant to be of service to us.</text>

Even I made an online appointment I waited forever to check in because the employees were way too slow regardless customers inconveniences! The line was long and long..
Grumpy and upset employees!
They unkindly responded to the applicants and looked upset at something for some reason! Remember that our taxes feed you!

I got my permit today after waiting for over 5 hours. There was a homeless lady in the line with me as well. She was obviously mentally unstable. When she reached her turn, the lady at the front desk told her the instructions to renew her CA ID so quickly in such slurred speech that not even I could understand her if I wasn't being attentive. When the homeless woman asked for her to repeat the instructions again, she was scolded for not listening to directions. The woman started filling out her papers and she was stuck because she didn't have an address. She asked the front desk for help again, and the same lady told the homeless woman in a raised, irritated voice to FILL OUT YOUR ADDRESS. I would be incredibly annoyed if I didn't have an address and my only instruction after I asked for help was to "fill out my address." But not only was woman homeless -- was mentally handicapped! No official at the DMV took the time to consult her with the specialized help she actually needed. She wasn't there just for the heck of it; she had legitimate paperwork from the police department issuing her to renew her state ID. I was very saddened by the way the officials at the DMV were treating her. They had aggravated her to a point at which a sheriff needed to intervene. Had they taken the time to make her feel helped and cared for, she wouldn't have retaliated in the way she did. She knew she was being mistreated because she was ill and homeless, and that's such a shame.

Other than that, all other officials at the office were very attentive to my needs and helped me pass through the process of getting my permit with as much ease as they could. I guess you have to be a healthy, abled, young person to receive some decent help from the Laguna Hills DMV.</text>

But I have to say Laguna Hills is a better place for people to get their driving license. The road is ups and downs, but less crowded. It will definitely reduce your nervous during the test. All the instructors are super unhappy, but we also need to understand that they are doing the same thing with every person every day and some of the drivers are not responsible ones. It is boring. And it is dangerous for them too. If we do this kind of job ourselves, we wouldn't feel happier than them.

If possible, there was even no one star for this rating! It’s a bad experience with DMV Laguna Hills office window #3 today! The guy working there was rude and was not being honest! He lied about my record saying I paid late for the registration in 2016, actually I bought the car in June 2016, the first registration was done by the car dealer, my first due was year 2017.<//Review>

Horrible experience!
The wait time is so long.
There’s only one officer to take the drive test of almost 20 cars. We were waiting 3hours and there was only 5 cars ahead of us! Like they are two drive test / each hour.
When we went for permit test, it took us six hours! Their computers system  hung twice during the test and she has to start over.<//Review>

< Review>
Every single time I have had to go to this place I knew I was going to clear my day. I once went with my sister to get a copy of her driving record. That was it. It only takes like  3 minutes. We stood in line for 50 minutes then had to wait 6 hours. The people at the counter kept saying that the person who does driving records is at lunch or backed up or ....so many excuses. Finally C4 was called and it took the lady who claimed to not be the normal one to do it in not even  3 minutes. She typed the name and pressed print. We got there at 830am in didn't leave until 1:45pm. I was so upset. There is not enough chairs the layout is not good the staff are grumpy. I like how San clamente the booths are against the wall and the chairs are all in the center. That way no matter where you are in the waiting you can easily access the booth. Laguna hill the booths are in a big block protruding into the room and chairs a scattered around the room and you have to keep cutting through the  line to get to the other side. Poor layout. Unprofessional. And the staff don't seem to be happy to be there and take it out on you.< /Review>

I have been waiting them to call me for 7 hours! Yes it is 7 hours, took 3 hours to check in, and 4 hours after I got my service number. I am still waiting and don't know when this will be ended. The people work for check/in are really bad. They are rude and angry. Don't on come to this DMV without a appointment.< /review>

Worse than ever. They have a computer system to assign turns, supposedly to avoid standing in line, but it takes well over an hour to reach that point, standing in line!! Most of that time is spent outside the building, and because of that employees don't even perceive how crowded it is and do nothing to speed up their pace. The person running the computer that assigns the turns spends an awful amount of time finding any reason to delay, reject or modify your request, and rudely lecturing every customer. A lady over 8 mo. pregnant stood up in line next to me for 1 hour and 50 min. finding not even a chair to sit, leave alone an expedite line.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Had to wait in car for 2 hours in the sun even after checking in because the driving instructors decided to take their lunch breaks at 2 pm. Then ended up getting failed so my instructor can process more people, so I waited 3 hours for less than 5 minutes of actual testing. Would've given a 0 stars if possible. To anyone taking their first driving test, try fullerton dmv instead.</review></record>

Six hours I have been here and still nothing is done. Nothing. The state of California should be embarrassed by their DMVs. If you cant wait the 3 or so months for an appointment hate to tell you, but you're out of luck.</Review>

Where do they find the people to staff this place? Today I had to point out that a date ending in /2013 means THIS YEAR. And this was on a printout from the DMV website. Unreal.
BUT - later today my mechanic told me about a benefit of AAA membership I'd forgotten about, but worth sharing (probably worth the price of AAA membership just to avoid the DMV sinkhole):

The following DMV services are available in AAA branches (new driver's licenses and driver’s license renewals are not available):

Vehicle and vessel registration renewals
Duplicate registration and stickers
Driver’s license change of address
Release of liability
Used vehicle transfers
New and used boat transfers
Duplicate plates
Parking placards
Personalized license plates
Disabled plates
Off Highway Vehicle Registration Renewal</Text>

I've been to the DMV many times in my life and not saying my experience was spectacular but it was at least decent. But today I decided after my experience that the people working at the DMV purposely give misleading information to frustrate people and make things take more time. A woman walked up to a man to ask a quick question and he told her incorrect information and tried to stop her from trying to make an appointment. I could not stand to listen to this and interjected and told her she should make an appointment at another location (hint some locations are easier to get appointments at then others). Then the guy that tried to help me didn't even look at the documents I gave him before he told me I didn't have the right stuff, I had to show him that I did. The people who work at the DMV  (and I'm not talking about everyone, but most of the people) PURPOSELY are inefficient and PURPOSELY try to make things more difficult than it needs to be. If the website was more clear (which they will never make it more clear) and the people who worked here knew what they were talking about, the process of the DMV would be more efficient but I've realized efficiency is not what they want, they purposely want to waste people's time.<//Text>

<review>Cons: phenomenal waiting time. Almost 6 to 7 hours
Long lines in morning be there by 6 of you want to get out by 12.
No seperate line for license and vehicle registration

Pros:
easy parking
Knowledgeable staff
Got work done easily for which other dmv did not even care to look at policy and rules.
Appointment is ideal in and out in an hour
Restroom inside dmv

This is by far the worst dmv office on the planet. Staff was slow and after waiting 6 goddamn hours they tell us their system crashed and I had to go to the Costa Mesa office to get a simple license renewal done. Although I spent two and a half more hours there, it was still a bliss compared to the long hellhole that is Laguna hills dmv. My advice, don't ever visit this office, you would be significantly better off at any other dmv office.</Review>

This DMV is beyond crowded. Also, when I did not pass my permit test, they offered to let me take the test again in 30 minutes. That made no sense to me. At the San Clemente DMV, they told me to wait a week from after taking the test. I don't know who is doing the right thing and who is doing the wrong thing. I would like to figure that out....</Text>

<text>They just need to do something about the long long lines. After I was being help the lady was really nice to me. The only think I will suggest is that they should do something for the older customers.  It's very sad seeing them standing there for hours at a time.  I don't think that is good for anyone. One more thing, they need to have more people helping the customers.< /text>< Pictures>

Please stop the pain. I'm here to pick up personalized plates and I have a million things to do. They make it look like the wait is shorter than it is but you'll soon realize that there are at least 6 different call letters in front of the numbers so the wait for your number, mine was B049, is like 15 minutes between your category numbers. When I got here there were only 11 numbers ahead of me. 11x15 minutes is so unacceptable. Next time I'm going to stab myself in both arms so at least I can watch myself bleed instead of doing nothing.<//Text>

As much as I hate going to the DMV; and as frustrating as my experience just was (even with an appointment it took me an hour to complete my transaction), my satisfaction is knowing I'm not one of the unfortunate folks that works there. Those poor bastards; I really feel for them. Why would you ever subject yourself to that job?!?! I don't get it.</Text>

<text>I wish I could give zero instead of one star. It is too much for this place. The crew training here definitely not mention anything about efficiency at all. No matter how small the thing you want to do, coming to this place meaning you gonna waste 4 hours in line at least to see the operator. What makes it even worse is that you may end up not being able to finish anything here. You waste your time and effort and not being able to finish anything? The only place I can image is poison. Off course and this DMV.<//text>< Resp>

Went to pick up personalized license plates today. 3 hour wait just to sign in and who knows what the wait time was after that, typically 2 hours. This was at around 11 a.m. This is totally unacceptable in my opinion, 5 hour wait to get something done. Trying to make appt. and dates for appt. are a month from now. Another useless government run establishment. Take a chair, water, food, be prepared to spend the day.</review>

In no rush to help the tax payers who make their paychecks possible when there is a line wrap around the building in a triple digit heat. On August 12th, the soonest available appointment is mid October and if you show up to pick up a license plate, it'll take over 2 hours just to get to the front desk. Can't wait for the day that everything gets done online and all these people become a number in the unemployment system.<//review><UserId.>117119387365490514477< /UserId.><Date>1534088466906</Date></record>

< review>
With an appointment waited over 40 min. Just to be given paperwork to fill out so my *disabled 90 year old friend could get her identification card. ..one person was alternating between serving appointments and non-appointments she was also being asked questions by other dmv WORKERS I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW UNORGANIZED and a joke this place is after waiting another 45 min. our number was called , to go to the furthest window away from where the photos are taken,  the worker was gone by the time we arrived, * when he came back he proceeded to finish working on his previous victim ignoring us and making us *stand there , seemed like a long time but was only a minute,. As he was entering the information into the computer he kept saying I gave him the wrong zip code. So I pulled up the address on my phone and showed him that it was the one associated with that address. He stated, "Computers were known to be wrong" and continued to argue with me. I asked him "what do you want from me"? USE THAT DAMN zip code" and then he did geez all this time making this sweet disabled lady stand there. Well after he was finished we had to walk all the way back through the crowd to where the photos were taken so we could finalize this nightmare. If you have a choice go somewhere else. On a positive note We Did receive the ID 7 days later.< /review>

It's such a pain to visit this place, prepare a little chair if you are going to be waiting without an appointment. Every time i go it would take me 3-6 hours to get things done. One thing I hate about DMV is that they give you a random number and make you wait there the whole time, it doesn't make any sense. They should really learn from those restaurants and use the little thing to ring you when it's your turn, or at least give you an estimated time... Lol someone please fix this system.</Review>

She claimed my wife is undocumented, when in fact the I-797 is a valid document that extends her green card status for a year.

<review>A very nervous but responsible young man took his driving test for the first time yesterday with instructor, Mr. Herbert.  My understanding is that the instructor failed this young man for stopping unnecessarily while approaching an intersection that had a two-way stop for the street going in the opposite direction.  My complaint is that Mr. Herbert, without explanation, asked the young man to return to the DMV - got out of the car - handed the young man his exam sheet and said "better luck next time kid".  It would have been nice if Mr. Herbert would have counseled this young man as to what he did wrong and why instead of making him feel inadequate, small and totally embarrassed.  While this is just a job to Mr. Herbert, it is a huge milestone for this young man and was handled so badly.  It will be an experience he will never forget.  I hope you never get Mr. Herbert for your driving test.< /review><Name>Linda McCord</Name>< Response>

I wish I could put down 0 stars. I came here with my infant baby at 8am(they start at 9am on Wed) and there was already a line of 40+ people. I'm used to spending a couple of hours at DMV, but this is unbelievable, I was here from 8am till 5:15pm, a full working day, just to get CA license and register my car. Some workers are really nice and efficient, others are not helpful and rude. Lady at the front desk that was giving away 'pass /no pass' driving test documents commented to me 'get a babysitter', discriminatory(!),  next time I go to places like this I will bring voice recorder. There are people that would gladly take her job. Nobody should be treated like that in this country. There is no changing station if you have a baby, no place to sit for the capacity of people. This place is understaffed, poorly organized and just in general unfriendly/aggressive with their patrons.< /Review>

As I assumed,  my trip to the DMV would be a process (lets be honest,  it always is).  I usually go to the san clemente DMV, but it's closed for renovations.

Laguna was as good as it gets for a DMV.

I got there 10 minutes early (i suggest going earlier).  I overheard that if you want to take a behind the wheel test, you need to make an appointment a few weeks in advance.

anyway,  there were two employees going down the line helping answer questions and directing people.  This meant once we got in,  we were good to go.

I got my number.

sat down.

Then the entire California DMV system went down.

Were people upset?  sure.  But it's not the employees fault.  The problem was in Sacramento.

The bottom line is that all employees here were very VERY communicative and constantly let us know what was going on.

The system turned back on,  I handled my errands,  and I was out.

Granted the DMV isn't ever an experience we look forward to,  but the employees here made it as painless as possible.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Driving instructor was chatting loudly with his buddies before my driving test about "going out for lunch" right in front of me, and then DQed me as soon as I made 1 mistake. His voice was so loud and clear when he was talking about "holding hands with her" when he was chatting with them, but with me during the road test, he was mumbling (if only he was loud and clear with me) and...literally just sat there not giving instructions for like 2 min (when I was in the road now. No left, right, straight, nothing) after he instructed me to make a right turn out of the dmv. That was my 2nd time testing so I can compare how bad this instructor was compared to my first instructor.
I guess he was able to eat lunch early.< /Review>< Response>

I would give them 0 stars if I could!  Totally unhelpful place!  I needed my DL renewed and I had to make three visits there in a week.  The online appointment system didn't work for that office, and the appointment phone line was forever on hold so those were useless!  I first went there last week, arrived at 8:20am and waited 45 min to get to the START HERE desk, only to be told that their Drivers License system was down (no sign posted at the door to warn people).  They couldn't tell me when it would be up again.  They acted like it's just your bad luck!  I went back two days later hoping for a better experience, but saw the long line outside so gave up since I couldn't afford to wait.  I arrived at 8:10am today and the line was already about 50 people long.  Waited for almost 2 hours to just get a number to be called.  That took another 1.5 hours! The staff was totally unhelpful.  They treated people like dirt!  The one who was supposed to take my photo was so absent-minded that she asked me to wait, only to disappear for half an hour!  They apparently think that your time is worth nothing!  I am so glad that in person DL renewal is only once every 8 years!  Avoid this office!  It's a shame that our tax dollars support their salaries yet they act as if they are above everyone else!!!  DMV and the Social Security Administration are the two big swamps that ought to be uphauled or drained!<//Text>

a "10 minute" wait listed on their website equates to lines forming around the building and the one next to it (not exaggerating). When registering my new car, the gentleman helping me was friendly but had no idea what he was doing. I had to correct a few of his mistakes as far as smogging and taxes when you purchase a vehicle from a dealer. When I went in to get a renewed license, it never got to me and they told me to come back. After another 3 hours of waiting I had to go to work which meant going to the DMV a THIRD time and waiting another 5 hours because apparently no one in the freaking city has a job and they all have time to stand in line all day. I ended up going into the San Clemente location and I was in and out in 10 minutes. Seriously they need to restaff that whole chicken sh@% outfit they have going on at Laguna Hills and get all the drug addicted federal workers into a rehab center.< /text>

worst wait times ive seen. i spent 3 1/2  hours there for something that took 10 mins to file and complete but the lady that helped me was very nice and  efficient. the place is just way to under staffed for its needs. San clemente was much faster last i had to go to the DMV< /text>

KNOWLEDGE
PATIENCE
PLAN ON BEING AT ANY DMV, in CA.
“INSTANT GRATIFICATION” doesn’t exist at any DMV.  SO SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP & BE AWARE THAT THESE people ONLY WORK FOR DMV. They Are Not the DMV RULEMAKERS.
The Employees are very nice.
SHOUT OUT TO THE LADY AT WINDOW 8 today
is extremely considerate. She’s not rude. She’s human like the rest of us.
3 hours is typical for NON appointments. I’ve been to DMV’s up and down California’s coast. San Diego, Riverside, and Orange County ALWAYS have a wait. All I’m saying is of course...... without appointments there is .....
“INSTANT GRATIFICATION” isn’t possible
Just saying it’s been like this since the dawn of my time....  that don’t get angry at the “DMV” not because they didn’t get what they came do done, it’s  common sense to plan on being at DMV reviews are mostly due to wait time. MAKE APPOINTMENT. DUH. be prepared. ITS USUALLY WORTH WAITING....... I GOT 4 Things Done in one visit, totally worth the wait.
I recommend IF you have difficulties waiting, due to anxiety or any disability maybe try to go to dmv.gov or just google it.... IF that doesn’t help, make apointment bring a healthy family or Driend to stand in line for you. If you have any difficulties waiting & lots of standing.
They let people w disabilities in a different line so they don’t have to stand so much. I’m disabled. I did not go thru the disabled only line. But it’s here I can see it.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Wait time today was 9 hrs. Not kidding. I thought if I got here at 12pm to renew my DL I would be done by 5pm. Nope. The poor woman next to me got here at 8:30am. It is now 4:50pm and her number is far from being called. The workers here advised that we all go to the San Clemente DMV.</Text>

This has to be the worst run DMV in the country. Their queueing system is inept and somebody with a bit of desire and willing to make a difference could fix the place in a flash. One queue for everything ... hours just to get a number to wait yet again. Same person attending appointments and walk ins. An absolute shame.< /Text>

< review>
Went to renew drivers license 4 months ago. Too early. Try again online a month before expiration. Too late. No appointments available for weeks. 70 people in line when they opened. Line is not for service, it is to get a number to wait in another line. Website said wait time is 30 minutes, yet I have been standing here an hour and am still waiting outside. Despite this, half of the windows are not open.</review>

Same as most DMV. Not happy employe they hate what they do. They treat you  like you are not human. You need to be like robot here they dont even have a tolerance for a question. If DMV would be a pravite company all this people working here would  lose their job in second. Waste of state money.< /text>

<username>momo williams<//username><Time>1499719612388<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>Got to the DMV at 7am and had a great spot in line for when it opened at 8. At 8 a lady comes out and hands everyone paperwork. She told us we needed a birth certificate, which we didn't have, and kept telling us that they won't do anything for us unless we had it and to not waste our time. We leave and call them only for them to tell us that we indeed had everything we needed so we head back. By 830 the line was wrapped around the building to the other shops. It's currently 145pm and we are still waiting for our number to be called. Literally almost our whole day has been spent here. On top of that, I asked a blonde women who seemed like the manager or something where the bathroom was and she responded in the most rude manner like I had inconvenienced HER day. The most disgusting experience ever and it's not even done yet.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce87e8cfd0a97:0xc47c2586563974a8</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Please take extra care of your original documents, esp. immigrants. Please don't hand over your important original documents unless asked.

The officers at this place are very very careless. I just lost my Original docs of Immigration. The officer who took the original documents to take the photocopies never returned the originals and instead just replaced it with copies.

When I realized this , I went back to the office. I asked the same officer. he didn't even listen to my problem and ask me to get back in the line. I took the line, the lady at the 12th window was nice and she asked me to talk the Manager. I explained my situation and told I didn't get my original papers back and they are my work permit paperstoo. What he did is,  he just looked into a small cardbox box at his office which he said it is the 'Lost and Found box'. Thats it! At least he could have checked with the officer or any others about any missing documents. He just literally said he cannot help me at all. I went back and pleaded to him twice. No use.
What a manager.. He didn't do anything at all when one of his employees mishandled the original documents. The DMV must return the originals. However, i didn't get my documents back.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Got there one hour prior to opening without appointment. I waited so long, people from the line behind me finished before I did. Try about 25 mins before I even had my letter called. Then another 5 for my number. excuse was, only 2 people can do my paperwork. I waited almost 3.5 hours to complete my registration. No change of address and I paid in cash.  Terrible experience. This is why people dread the DMV.< /text>

I wish I could give negative stars. Waiting in line for 4 hours at Tuesday afternoon, I got a number(060) from 1 hour ago. I didn’t check it until I found the number is moving way too forward. Then I waited in line again to ask what happened. The lady blamed on me and assumed i left the building. How ridiculous, how could a person finally got her number at 4:20pm and then left the building??! Unprofessional, and not responsible. Smh< /text>

<review>horrible waste...stop hand grading tests, hire bilingual employee's, and honor appts! what is the point of this institution if it cannot offer the simplest services in a timely fashion (seriously, a 7 year old with an iPad could replace 6 dmv workers). what's the point of filling out forms if people are going to manually enter the information at a snails pace? automate this system and get rid of the slobs who work there. keep the DMV open all day Saturday, all day Sunday so you can accommodate hard working people who have to use a vacation day just to renew their license. yes, a vacation day spent in the living hell of the laguna dmv. Appt. made 3 weeks in advance for 10 am left 430pm. let a private company take over and fix this, please!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

You'd think they'd throw in a little bit more money to a place like this and at least get more staff.

<review>Ridiculously long waits regardless of the nature of the issue, even with appointment. Be aware that you cannot make appointments for issues they expect to be resolved online and irregularities on their part still has to be resolved by you waiting on line all afternoon.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Name>

The staff at this DMV is for the most part very unkind. You can tell that they hate their job no matter how much you try to make it easy for them. I went for my behind the wheel appointment today and my instructor was horribly rude. I get it, a drive test is a drive test, but it doesn't hurt to have some politeness.<//Review>

Horrible! I was at this DMV for 3 1/2 hours for a 20 minute behind the wheel test! It seems the employees like to take a lot of breaks and let fellow coworkers carry the burden of the long appointment lines. After I passed my test at the end, I was called to a window to be helped but then the guy left for a break right after he was told he would help me!</Text>

This office has a very serious waiting problem. I went there at 7:30am for registration and got out after 4 hours. I also went there again hoping that they've  fixed the waiting problem, but I ended up waiting 5 hours for drivers license.(2 hours in the line outside of the office, 2 hours inside)< /review>

My friend's applied for renewing a new driver license as hers had expired. But she waited for 2 months and got nothing.  When she went to the DMV again, the staff said they missed her application number they need applied a new driver license again. What a riduculous joke!<//Review>

Pretty well organized, few people showed up early in the morning.  There is  a limited capacity so you may wait outside for a while. Just try to bring all your paperwork ready, some stuff needs apointment or  some forms need to be filled  which you can download and bring them ready and that makes the process much faster.  Overall  the personal were very nice, patient and helpful not a bad experience like years ago.</review>

(Translated by Google) Come in line as early as possible, there will be service personnel inquiring about what kind of business to handle one by one. If you apply for a new exam and have uploaded the data, the number will be distributed and queued. After the relevant documents are checked, the number will be written in and the number will be called and paid. /Test your eyesight, take a photo and then take a computer screen test. After you pass, you will get a driver’s license and you can book a road test.

儘早來排隊，會有服務人員逐一詢問辦理何種業務，若新申辦考照且已上傳資料，會分發號碼牌另外排隊，檢驗相關證件資料通過後，會寫上號碼入內等叫號，付費/驗視力，排隊拍照後接著電腦螢幕考試，通過後拿到學習駕駛證，並可預約路考。<//review>
