Highly Recommended!
I don't really write reviews unless the service exceeds my expectations. This is our second time here for window tinting. My husband and I were so pleased with the service and quality, plus great customer service! Miguel ( Mike ) is so professional and knowledgeable, he answers all our questions. Very honest guy, no hidden fees and easy to communicate. We made another appointment for windshield replacement --he gave us a fair price.< /text>

< review>
I brought in my GT Mustang for window tint.
The work that was done was not well work or to standard. The film is not cut straight or even on the edges. I should have walked it more clearly before leaving the lot. However, Mike is very kind and professional & they make you feel comfortable and this is why I am giving 3 stars ... but when you pay $200 for a GT Mustangs window tint you want it done properly and not half ass😩</review>

Miguel, is very easy to talk to and communicate with. You can tell he is a very hard worker. The work he did was very good. I only had one issue, in that he said he'd advise me when a part came in and I think he may have forgotten, since when I called about it he said he'd had it almost a week. Nothing major, just sharing all the info. Again, I say the work he did (tinting and window regulator replacement) was very good, and it's hard to find places that do both repairs and tinting.<//review>

Highly recommended this place. Been to multiple tint shops for years and by far this is the best. Miguel the owner and his wife are super friendly, comfortable and professional to be around. Seating area while You wait was comfortable and caught a good movie. Close to places to eat while You wait. The quality and prices were great. Only 3M film used here which is what I only use and computerized laser cut film for accuracy.  Top notch work and quality.  Thanks Miguel. Very happy customer. Will come back again.<//review>

Miguel was very professional and knowlegable.  The entire order and install process was extremely easy.  He replaced the windshield to my Lexus and it looks great!!  Prices were great and the work was completed on time while I waited in their lobby.  Thank you so much and I would definately refer you to my friends.</text>

The best place to tint your car windows! He gave me professional limo tint with no issues at all and the cheapest price in the county! There is a couch and tv where you can put on whatever movies you’d like while waiting for the tint. Quality work for the best price, would recommend to anyone and would gladly go back for future cars.< /Review>

<Text>Brought 3 cars here 2 personal and 1 work. Had a windshield chip repaired, chip turned out to be too big so we got a new windshield and he took the price of the chip repair off. Also had a side window replaced and tint done on all remaining windows. Great work, great price and great outcome. Will be back!<//Text>< pictures>

She followed their directions and left the tint alone etc. it never adhered correctly and looked bubbly. My daughter took her car back this summer and found the business was no longer there. On a good note, Best Choice Auto Glass took over. The service was amazing and worthy of 5 stars. Even though it was not their work, they fixed my daughter’s tint for free. Kudos to them. We will be back for sure.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Great work done on my car!!! I love how the tint turned out and as long as you call ahead to let them know the car model and such everything runs smoothly, the employees here are very kind, bilingual (Spanish which is always great), and very friendly. I recommend going here if you want a nice tint job. Btw they also replace windshields!!! This is the place to be!!!</review><user>110383971846036947244< /user><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

Horrible work and even worse customer service! My tint bubbled and peeled and they only offered to fix the 2 smallest windows even though I have a warranty! I called the warranty center and as soon as I told them the name of the business I was told a lot of people complain about the work they do. I do not recommend! Do research and find a more reputable shop. These guys are garbage just like their customer service! If I could give them negative stars I would!</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I got my car windows tinted here and they completely screwed it up. They told me that the bubbles on the back window is the best they can do after multiple tries. Unfortunately my car was new at the time and to this very day there is glue or something that does not come out on my interior in the back seat from the multiple attempts of taking off and putting back on the window tint. Looking back should have took this business to court for damages and my money back. I had a gift card so I really had no choice. Hopefully someone will read this and reconsider getting tint from this place even if they have a gift certificate.. Overall shady place that doubles as a security guard business as well with security guards in and out picking up uniforms.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The service is great, every time I go! Fellas are happy and friendly. Julio and Johnny the best customer service. Last ones at the shop till the work is done and with a smile on their greasy faces. Always looking to help you find the best deal too. Thanks guys! Will be back for the oil change in a couple months..< /review>

I've brought my car here for oil changes just twice now while my main mechanic's been out for the time being, and I couldn't be happier with the quality of service I get from this location! The guys are always very thorough and explain everything I need to know about what they see in the inspections, and don't push me to buy anything extra I don't need or want right then. Not to mention they have awesome deals on oil changes— $20 off with full synthetic oil, just what my car needs for just the right price. :)</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I arrived at 8 am. Right when they open.  Wow. It's going so quick.  Already 2 guys working on my oil 2 min after I got in.  It's a quick service. And people are so nice and polite.  Look like oil change take 15-20 min and you out of here.< /Text>

<review>Stay away from these crooks.
They talked my elderly mother into getting a lot of unnecessary  "Repairs". Not only did she not need the work, she couldn't afford it. So they arranged for her to pay with credit from a company that has a high interest rate on charges. Her monthly payments hardly covered the principal on the loan.
I hate these types of crooks.
Shame on Jiffy Lube and their "helpful" employees.<//review>< Pics>

Went to get my radiator flushed after driving 2300 miles. The guy was so busy  telling me I was wrong about a leak. It didn't leak at all prior to the flush. He left my radiator cap loose. All the fluid came out due to no Pressure on the cap.  Might want to double check if you have this done. I am part way across California now and it's to late. Also it says on my receipt that I denied to have the air checked on my tires. They never asked...<//text>

I went in this weekend with rotors that needed a warranty exchange. It took a few to work out the details but Demetrius was excellent. He was able to work out a good deal to get me back out on the road with smooth brakes and not a huge dent in my pocket. I really appreciate the extra help to get the warranty honored.

Every single employee there was helpful and courteous!< /Text>

Wicked overpriced, for a non synthetic oil change 5 quarts they charge about 60 bucks, i ask why the f so expensive for basic oil change and filter?? Oh because they check your fluids and air pressure and suggest overpriced repairs that I didn't ask for no thanks. Also unprofessional, like they never seen a sports car I could see them playing with my mustang gt in the bay wasting my gas and my time took about 30 minutes without anyone in front of me. Only gave 2 stars because it was a sunday  my normal mechanic was closed charges 25 bucks but I needed oil and dont have tools. Not coming back sorry<//text>

Today Friday July 26 around 4:00pm I went to Jiffy Lube for a routine oil change. RJ the shop's  manager was very delightful to deal with, he made sure all my personal and vehicles information was updated, filed and entered in the computers system. RJ was a breath of fresh air and found a few discounts since I left my coupons at home he took real good care of me. Yes I will definitely be going back to this Jiffy Lube for the Top Quality Service I received today.
Thank you JR for letting me believe again I can trust someone to take care of me and my car as required.
A customer for life.

I went there today and I had the best experience ever. Make sure you ask for Lauren who is the manager and she is very responsive and assist the best she can. She is very nice and helpful. This was my first time at this location and I promised Lauren that I would come back again because I got better service with her than dealership. Thank you for making this experience Roth the drive to your location. Lauren keep up the fabulous outstanding work. You are amazing. Also the staffs know what they are doing 👍👌👏🏻< /Text>

I was very very happy with the services I received here! I just bought a very used car and took it in for a small part of a tune up. The staff were so friendly and very hard working, and fast! The manager was able to answer all of my questions in surprisingly great detail, she even drew me a ton of pictures to help me see what she was talking about, and she even showed me on the car exactly what she was talking about and I could see it all myself. Together we made up a plan for the other services I will want and need in the future, and I never felt pressure to get anything done that I didn't feel was necessary. I felt like an informed decision-maker rather than just a customer and I will DEFINITELY be returning here.</Text>

The new owners are very friendly. They are very efficient and it's excellent Quick Service I was in and out of there before I knew it before I knew it I would recommend you getting an oil change at this Jiffy Lube Oil Change awful Beach Boulevard in the city of Garden Grove right next to the 22 freeway exit Beach Boulevard. Check it out for the best oil change service in Orange County!<//Text>

They tried to sell me a brake fluid flush/exchange that I did not need.  Showed me a "test strip" where it was deep purple.  I heard them telling the other person in the waiting room the same thing.  Since I had only gone in for an oil change, I decided to pass on the brake fluid flush. Good thing I did.  Took my car to Sears Auto Center and they actually did a test of my brakes.  Everything was fine.  They told me I was not in need of a brake fluid flush/exchange!

Jiffy Lube had also said my battery was only operating at 40%.  Not true!  The battery was tested by 2 other auto shops, and was fully functioning!

I also discovered the next day, after my visit with Jiffy Lube, they did not push my dipstick back in place where it was suppose to be.  It was sitting up high wobbling around when I looked under the hood.

I will not be going back to this location.</text>

The staff was very friendly. They try to upsell you on items not included in the regular checkup. That's ok if you can afford their higher markup. Don't remember waiting this long...took over an hour and I only had the basic service performed. Wipers cost a fortune extra. Car was cleaned inside. I had $15 discount coupon from the Internet search but forgot to use it.</text>

Annoyed that an oil change took over an hour. When I pulled in I asked specifically how long it would be, the response I got from Isamel was max 45 min. He said it would probably be closer to 30 though. I said if it’s gonna be an hour I’ll come back a different day, and assured me there were only 2 cars ahead so it shouldn’t be an hour. Won’t be going back to this location. Caused me to be late my next appointment which made me miss the one after that. Don’t know how else to explain it other than just plain annoying, disrespectful of my time< /review>

<Text>Worst service I have ever received for my car. Went to get my oil and transmission fluid changed. They ended up BREAKING 3 of my lugnuts off by overtorquing them while doing their "complimentary brakes check". Ended up spending $400 (even after $50 coupon) and 4 hours at this dump and they didn't even fix it. I ended up taking it to Morrison down the street who fixed my lug nuts for ~$100. Will never go back to Jiffy Lube. These people obviously don't know what they are doing.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dd2f53df046ca9:0x4834d0208dae1b06<//Gmap_id></record>

Not only did they forget to replace a bolt on my engine, but they refused service. I was polite when I declined additional services, but they told me they would not change my oil until they preformed these services! Sounds like a great way to get me to pay extra money.

My experience was horrible and if I could give it a no star rating I would. They replaced the bulb in the brake light and said everything was good and two weeks later the brake light goes out again. When I called Jiffy Lube they said there might be some problems with the wire. when I took it the first time i was told that everything is fine now they're saying it might be this or that. I think they are just making stuff up.

Don't waste your time coming here because they don't know what they're talking about and they will try and tell you that there is 10 things wrong with your car and in reality there might be only 1 or 2 things wrong. They just want your money.<//review>

<Review>This place is freaking horrible, they did not tight my oil cap tight enough , and it felt off when im on my way back to Oklahoma, caused my engine messed up so bad, when i called them they ignored me several times, this is the worst place ever, i don't think this place worth even 1 star, the the manager yelled and give me attitude when i talk it out, they are so unprofessional.  Dont ever bring your car here.OH YES I FORGOT THAT YOU REFUSE TO FIX THE ENGINE DAMAGE THAT YOUR EMPLOYEES MADE TOO , CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE THE GUT TO REPLY.</Review>< Time>

<Review>Slow service. The other reviews are right about up selling the brake exchange I took my car to the dealer and I do not need the highly suggested and misleading fluid change and the dip stuck I was showed wasn't mine , so beware if that for sure. DO NOT GET THE BRAKE EXCHANGE OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU DIDN'T COME FOR. GO TO A DEALER OR A TRUSTED REPAIRSHOP FOR THAT BUT THEY WERE NICE AND COFFEE AND DONUTS. OUTSIDE WAITING AREA AND INSIDE. CROWDED BUT THEY DID DO MY OIL CHANGE PROPERLY EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO COME BACK TO GET MY OIL CHANGE LIGHT OFF THE NEXT MORNING AFTER WORRYING. NOTHING SPECIAL BUT AT LEAST I GOT THE OIL CHANGE. YOU GUYS GOT SOME WORK TO DO.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1466545590916, 'text': "We're saddened to read you feel this way, and we want you to know that our team takes your feedback very seriously.

THEY LEFT A BOLT LOOSE ON THE BRAKES!!!! (read the rest)
I know this because the bolt backed out and FELL OUT after a couple of days!!! This caused the brake caliper & bracket to swing and hit the inside of my wheel during braking! There is two bolts and thank god the other one was still there. If both bolts would have fallen out, I would have torn my brake line and lost my brakes!

Its crazy what a huge failure that is!
We came back to get the problem fixed and they acted like it was business as usual. The person who first took off the wheel to inspect it ended up leaving and handing off the job to another tech. That was kind of weird. Why start a job and leave right away? We ended up waiting 2 hours for them to find a replacement bolt for the one that fell out.

An experience like this blows me away! I can’t believe a pro shop would leave a brake component loose.

Be Safe, STAY AWAY…</Review>

Lauren at front desk was very helpful very polite.was told that car was vaccumed and when I got in car it there was trash all over it and not vaccumed at all when I asked if car was vaccumed they said yes I asked Lauren to look at car when she did she asked one of the guys to look at car and he just made a stupid remark to her and didn't want to see the car.now I'm kinda sketchy if they put the oil I paid for since they said they vaccumed car and cleaned windows wich neither one was done Lauren offered to vacuum car but at this point I was upset hopefully I got oil that I paid for Never again will I go to this location very upset!< /Review>

The customer service at Jiffy Lube was very good, however, it was a total rip off to charge me $50.00 for labor to install an oil filter which takes two seconds and is very easy to do. I've heard many stories since then of how much of a rip off and inaccurate you guys are with your service assumptions. Apparently this corporation has a very bad reputation, and I found this out by just sharing my experience with a handlful of acquaitances. I've come to conclusion that you're intentions are not to help your customers, but to rip them off. The customer service was so good that it distracted me from how much i was about to spend on a simple oil change and new oil filter. I strongly believe that this is done intentionally. Great job with the customer service, but sadly thats the only good thing i have to say about this company. Hole in the wall shops, or even Autozone will now and forever have my business.< /review>

Good clean fun for people of all ages and abilities. Bikes, scooters, skateboard and rollerblades all welcome. The people that frequent this park are very nice and respectful of younger kids just learning. Although it's not required please be safe and wear a helmet.<//review>

<Text>Let me start off by stating that I myself am not much of a skater. I like bikes and rollerblades.

This skate park is located on Humboldt ave, near the Dutch Bros on Main Street. There are bathrooms on the property. However, due to local vandals, the toilet seats are missing and there are no lights that turn on.
It is about a 10-20 minute walk from the plaza center and shops.

Many of my friends say it's okay for how big our town is. It was remodeled a couple years back, so it is a little bit modernized.< /Text>< pics>

Very fun. Lots of people most the time but most of them are just sitting around talking. Don't mind them if your self conscious about your riding, just have fun. Good for beginners and intermediate riders for skateboarding, bmx, or scoots. And definitely 420 friendly.</text>

A little pricey on some things, but as far as the meat, some good bargains, fresh meat and produce. My main problem with them was only one electric cart, and that is not always running. They need to have at least TWO that are in running mode!!!! Alot of disabled people in need here< /Text>

Used to have to go to Visalia for grocery shopping but this store has gotten more and more items in which makes it so much easier. Plus they have some awesome checkers.</review>

Everything is organized. They even carry some gluten free items. Cashiers are friendly. Its 9:41pm. One of the management isn't wearing a mask. He doesn't even have one. An employee isn't wearing her mask correctly. A customer without a mask. As I was paying someone walked in without a mask. Sign at door says you need a mask. Mandatory. Come on people, please wear your mask. Store personal please wear it too and remind customers about wearing one or no service. Otherwise everything is always clean and very neat.</text>

They are friendly and seem like the genuinely want to help you out.  I used to work at a grocery store and I can appreciate baggers, cashiers, and produce staff going out of their way to make sure you get in, get what you came for, and get out and quickly, pleasantly, and efficiently as possible.<//text><rate>4</rate>< Time>

Freshest produce you'll probably find in Woodlake, just to let everyone know I can without a doubt say the organization of the store has gone up a few letter grades with drastic changes and better more convenient way to shop for a delightful quality< /text>

Fully stocked grovcers. I drove from three rivers to get the good prices offered here. We bought shrimp and what we really went for was  a case of water. I was almost charged 12 for a case of waters up there.Was worth our about 25 minute drive.<//Text>

The people are friendly and helpful and I find everything I I need easily I appreciate that and I can't do much thank you and I appreciate it all for what you made the store you need more room more space make more of the store bigger move the registers away from the door make more room or move the doors maybe add on to the South door push it out 20 ft invent a better cart that you can take home or give the old people that walk a ride home that by more more than 35 or 25 dollars or more.<//Review>

<text>First time eating here and I'm sold. They have tons of sandwiches at several price levels. I got the Thunderdome (fried chicken) on a wheat roll and it was awesome. My wife got the same, but substituted halal chicken, on Dutch crunch and she loved it! The service was great, as was the attitude of everyone there. Definitely going back!< /text><Rating>5</Rating><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK1tE-dRnvI-4SE-kt0HG0BviRA6eYQcdVwx9g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5NrflmJ1cKvZ9jrMSMMoMha4xf3-yASaxryaw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX8uCWGxKM_ywx5fHpZtdEKii5ZONt77KvorD0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYK6I52qifftJhrOuqGc3dHUK_x4uQXNMDiGaM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAEc9EPZSEv8Nij3EXEmSdSzsSxYRub9focOWu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlkI_3Q3EzJXQoZvtTZHmK3Hb6mEJ-SKVtalS1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM1e-B_kr717OBTuqmZqv-JfpU4i_gpMtNY9RP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdhykMnDNDshJTi59ZmnYlaTwPBy1LDFPvRuYq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2zrJu1CeVazQ_hAUPRZOqf48igyxROfqPAz8X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Name>

Hot Mama halal chicken sandwich was yummy!  My usual, up north, was the Kerry Walsh, but this is a new fav.
Service was a bit, distracted...but always good vibes abound when at Ike's.
Go here, never Subway!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80e93f690383f1fd:0x72f5ad076e9d5a68<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is my favorite sandwich place. They usually have a plethora of vegetarian and non vegetarian sandwiches which taste delicious. I tried Jim Rome today for the first time. I did like it however, there was something in that sandwich that tasted a little bitter which spoiled the whole experience a little bit. Jim Rome is a turkey sandwich with avocado, red pesto and cheddar cheese. It tastes good but I have had better sandwiches at Ike's. Their fried chicken is quite famous and would definitely recommend that. Also for first timers.. do go for Dutch crunch 🍞 it is a delish!!!</Review>

Love Ike's everywhere, so glad there's on in IV. vegan and non vegan choices are great for mixed company. Anything with fried chicken in the move</Text>

I would like the music to not be as loud, but that is really the only complaint that I have about this place.  The names they use for their sandwiches are very creative and fun.  You can choose from sandwiches called The Barry Zito, Kevin Bacon, or even the Steph #Curryone, just to name a few.I ordered the Jaymee Sirewich, which was Fried Chicken, BBQ, Honey Mustard, Honey, Swiss, Cheddar, and Pepper Jack.  That's a whole lot to fit in a sandwich, and it was delicious.  It's a nice fun environment with good tasting food.  If you make a special trip into IV for lunch, make sure this is on the top of your list.< /text><Date>1461962425288</Date></record>

I’ve tried many places before and this is so far the best! Anita is truly a professional. Waxing has always been a torture for me, but she does it fast and almost painless, she is very detail oriented and never leaves a single hair. Also I get my eyebrows done here twice a month, there’s almost no wait and I always leave happy with result. Prices are great too!<//Text>

I absolutely love the location and the area.

Also, very easy to make last minute appointments, or Just walk in.

Very fast waxes and they know what they're doing.

Competitive prices, on the cheaper side so don't forget to tip these ladies.

Very Clean and I love their new look. I remember it used to be bright pink overwhelming almost, now it feels calm, clean, bigger and so much better.
I keep coming back for almost a year now.

Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area or even if you're not in the area, ladies here will make you feel like home. They're one of the nicest people that I know.<//text>

I went here last week for the first time. The girl was polite , however I went to other places that have done a better job at threading. If it's convenient and you need your eyebrows threaded immediately then go. I hope this place lasts they really could use a touch-up as it looks pretty run-down< /Review>

<text>Went in for a Brazilian wax two weeks ago and it was the worst experience. The girl that waxed me didn't know how to do it properly. It was extremely painful and ended up with a bad rash which I'm still suffering from today. I've been waxed so many times before and I know how it suppose to be done. I'll never go back there again. Also, I had threading done which was great and the owner is nice but stay away from getting waxed by the young girl, she really doesn't know how to wax and you will end up in bad shape.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I’ve been seeing Dr. Park for about 7 years now. I had 2 babys and she made me feel comfortable on both times when I had to do c sections. She listens to your issues in detail and offers different solutions. I like seeing her and will continue to visit her for sure. Also, her office staffs are the best!! They’re fast, informative and  nice.<//text>

<text>Dr. Park has been great. My wife and I met Dr. Park from the beginning of our pregnancy up to the delivery and post-delivery process. Dr. Park and her staff are courteous to their patients and try to help them out as much as they can. My wife had her post-delivery, 8-week later check-in last week and she told the office that she'd come see Dr. Park if we decide to have a second child.
Extra info: Dr. Park speaks Korean to a certain degree and her staff also speaks Korean (better than Dr. Park) so if any Koreans are worried about language barrier you don't have to worry too much.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I was so anxious for my appointment but as soon as i walked in i felt much more calm. Dr. Park has music and decorations that make the visit very pleasant. I did not wait long to see her and when i did i really felt like she cared so much about my health and she really listened to my concerns. We even talked a little bit about my anxiety which most doctors i have seen just look over. I am very happy with my visit.</review>

Dr. Park is the best. I actually look forward to my annual appointments with her because I feel like I'm seeing an old friend who cares about me, not a too-busy doctor. I moved out of her area but still make the drive to her office because her care is worth it.<//Text>

Dr. Park is so friendly and really takes the time to listen to you. We wanted a natural birth with as little intervention as possible. She gave us her opinions based on her extensive knowledge but ultimately deferred to us for what we wanted for our birth. Our visits never felt rushed she always made sure that our questions were answered. The staff at the front desk is great too. During delivery Dr. Park was super supportive and positive and easy to work with.<//review>

Dr. Park delivered our baby and the whole experience was stellar. I am actually sad I won’t be seeing her as often as I did because she is an outstanding doctor. Her bedside manner is one of the best I’ve experienced in my life. My husband thinks she’s great too. I don’t have anything negative to say as I highly recommend her.

Another plus is her staff. You can tell they are a a tight knit group and they probably eat lunch together and really know each other. They are all friendly, courteous and professional. Susie the receptionist is so on top of it...she doesn’t let things slip through the cracks. The nurses I had were also very nice. I never dreaded going to my appointments.

It’s hard finding good doctors period. Dr. Park is more than good. Once again I highly recommend!!<//Text>

<time>1559113351085</time><Rating>1</Rating><review>If you wanna spend more money, visit here. (I don’t have insurance.) Their price for regular check up is $275, this includes Pap smear(they say). BUT LABS ARE SEPARATE. I’m not sure what they mean by Pap smear is included when labs for Pap smear is not included. I guess they are saying collecting and sending sample for Pap smear is included. Well, without lab works, Pap smear is not really Pap smear. They shouldn’t  have said that the price includes pap. And they ask you to pay first before you see the doc. I’ve never seen any doctor’s office like that. They don’t have ultrasound so that’s additional too. I ended up spending much more and couldn’t get the answer of my conditions. I’m going for another doctor. My experience was terrible.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Dr. Park is compassionate and super sharp. I transferred to her when I was 30 weeks pregnant with my first child. She took the time to listen and understand my desired approach to pregnancy and delivery. Over the course of the next weeks we worked on a plan and she was very responsive and clear with her advice, instruction and expectations during final term and delivery.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Dr. Park is pretty much my favorite doctor EVER. I had so many questions and qualms going into my pregnancy, and she is so professional, warm, and patient. I totally recommend her and she will be my OB for life! (or at least for as long as I live in Los Angeles :)</review>

Dr. Park has been my doctor since 2008, when I got pregnant with my first child - another USC doctor (general doc) referred me to her because she had been his wife's doctor and delivered their three children.  I still feel as though I've met Dr. Park just a couple of months ago, and even though I don't see her every day, each time we see each other, it feels as though we've been BFFs our whole lives!  She's not only relatable, empathetic, deeply caring, and absolutely fantastic.  She keeps calm under  tricky and complicated situations, and if you thought she was fabulous during her show "Deliver Me" from the Discovery channel, you still haven't seen the depth of her humanity and kindness until she has been your doctor.

My second pregnancy was a bit more complicated than my first, but surely, everything went smoothly.  I don't think I fully appreciated the complications of my pregnancy because she played it all off as easy peasy, and with Dr. Park, it was.  She does this to keep pregnant women calm as she tries her best not to stress pregnant mommies.  She is also a great source for mommy advice and the way she explains her experiences as a mom, is so raw and honest, you can't help but adore her to death.  My kids' father's favorite phrase is, "If it's good enough for Dr. Park, then it's good enough for us!"  He takes Dr. Park's word as the final word.  We trust her deeply with everything, trust her opinion and her advice, and in the decade that we've known her, she has always been on point.  Thanks to her, we also found an amazing pediatrician (Dr. Park's pediatrician), and we absolutely LOVE Dr. Nakashima as well!

I am deeply disappointed in anyone who would think Dr. Park is anything short of an amazing human and a fantastic doctor.  My 10-year experience with her, two C-Sections, three surgeries, two very healthy bouncy baby boys, and about a million (okay a little exaggerated in how many) office visits  with her proves to me otherwise.  Words cannot express how deeply grateful I am to have her as my doctor, and how much I appreciate her medical advice and her wisdom as a mom.</review>

I waited two months and finally met Ms. Alane Park. After seeing the teacher, I feel that the two months of waiting was well worth it. Ms. Alane Park is an amazingly good doctor. I can confidently say that it is by far the best obstetrician I have ever met in my fifty lifetime. He listens to the patient's grievances and sincerely suggests solutions for them. Even during the examination, which may be a little scary, he treated with a very delicate and gentle touch and was considerate to reassure the patient's heart.

저는 두 달을 기다려 드디어 Alane Park 선생님을 만날 수 있었어요. 선생님을 뵙고서 그 두 달의 기다림은 충분히 가치가 있었다고 느껴집니다. Alane Park 선생님은 놀랍도록 훌륭한 의사예요. 내 오십 평생에 만나 본 산부인과 의사들 중에 단연 최고라고 자신있게 말 할 수 있습니다. 환자의 고충에 귀 기울여 주시고 환자를 위한 솔루션을 진심으로 제시해 주십니다. 좀 두려울 수 있는 검진에도 아주 섬세하고 부드러운 손길로 진료 하시고 환자의 마음을 안심 시키려 배려해 주셨어요. 믿을 만한 산부인과 의사를 찾고 있다면 Alane Park 선생님을 만나보실 것을 적극 추천 합니다.</text>< Pics>

Let's see....🤔
I've tried the tortas, enchiladas, burritos, and tacos. All at different times. All were consistently DELICIOUS! Taco truck style food, without the truck 👍</text>

< Review>
I've only had one meal here, a togo carnitas burrito while on a road trip up into the mountains. After ordering and they told me it would take 7 minutes, I knew it would be good, because they were cooking the carnitas specifically for this burrito. I'm not sure if that involves broiling or frying the cooked and spiced shredded pork, but they were crispy and delicious. Definitely worth a stop. I will probably stop here and get my road meals regularly.<//Review>

<Review>I ordered a Menudo this morning. When I started eating it I noticed a lot of short black pieces of hair. Almost looked like someone got a haircut next to the Menudo pot. I called them to complain and the lady said, Oh that’s how the Meudo is. It comes that way. I’m not sure if she’s on drugs but I have never seen that many dark hairs on meat like that. Horrible place!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>I admire this restaurant! They serve sensational dishes, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I like very much tasting all their dishes. The dishes are always tasty, the service towards the customers  is friendly. I frequently visit this place and I not even once was discontended. I recommend it to all.< /Text>< Time>

Very delicious food and very affordable. For  under $10 you can get a slice of yummy cheesecake, a cheeseburger, and a generous serving of fries. Hands down my favorite burger place. My boyfriend loves the chicken enchiladas, he says the chicken has lots of flavor. The service is friendly and fast too.<//Text>

<review>I ordered my chicken torta and got chunks of beef in it.   I have not eaten beef in years and I am very upset.   The server told me that they cook the beef and chicken together.   That is something that they should tell people about.   I will never come back.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I was referred to Jesse by a friend to work on my 1988 Ferrari 328 GTS. It is the first time I’ve had a Ferrari, although I have had other collector cars. Jesse was easy to work with and explained what my car needed, which included a major belt service. His work went above and beyond what I had expected and there was never any pressure from anyone there. Jesse was such a pleasure to work with.

I will definitely return there in the future for all of my services. I highly recommend San Francisco Motorsports.</text>

<Text>Had my 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo serviced (the 40,000 mile service) at San Francisco Motorsports recently. I've had this car for 10 years and have had some awesome modifications done, including a tune, new suspension, forged HRE wheels, and am very picky about any work done on this car.

I was very pleased with the service provided by SF Motorsports and the care they took in servicing my car. This will definitely be my go-to shop for anything my Turbo needs in the future.< /Text>< pictures>

I’ve been to SF Motorsports 4 times for pre purchase inspections (F430, California, and 2 Quattroportes) and had a fantastic experience each time I was there. Jesse and the staff are super knowledgeable and make you feel confident in what they find on their inspections. Prices are very fair and they are just nice people. Always enjoy my time there just talking cars with guys. One of the best shops in the Bay Area for high end cars. Highly recommend!< /text>

<Review>Had my F430 Spider top repaired by Jesse and the the team at SF Motorsports.  Top would not fold due to worn out elastic bands.  Repair was done in a timely fashion and the top now works perfectly.  Team is very professional, friendly, and straightforward.  Will be using  them for future maintenance and repairs. Highly recommended.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< user>

My car was seen at the Maserati dealership twice as well as an Indy shop which they could not figure out what was wrong with my car. Sf Motorsport swapped out my F1 pump on my 2005 Maserati. They also provided follow up service to make sure my car was running okay. I highly recommend their service! Kevin from Fairfield</review><user_id>109165901239474450888<//user_id>< Response>

What a fantastic discovery. All I needed was a quick change of bulbs in my headlight got quoted $75 at other locations. Called San Francisco Motorsports, they got me right in and replaced the bulb I was in an out in 10 minutes cost me $20. Great to work with very pleasant would recommend them highly they do auto repair and hybrid repair too!</Text>

<review>I have dealt with Matt on several projects and found him to be very honest and enthusiastic. Even more amazing is that he communicates well AND in a timely manner.
These things are very important to me and i want the sense that my car dealer/friend is willing and able to communicate, pay attention and be a pleasure to talk to.
Matt is all these things.<//review>< pics>

Jesse and team are just awesome. Being Ferrari factory trained, they have deep knowledge of both classic and modern Ferraris. I really appreciate their promptness and proactive communication - it's quite refreshing! And I especially appreciate the back/forth delivery service within the Bay Area where they pick up your car on a secure trailer, do some great servicing, and deliver it back to you when ready. It's my first time working with SF Motorsports, it will not be my last. A++++, thank you!<//text>

<review>My gf and I used to bring our Prius to Daly City Toyota for regular maintenance but got tired of the oversell and waking up at 5am just to lineup for service. The last straw was when we arrived at 6am at Daly City Toyota only to be told that there is no guarantee that they'll be able to do our oil change that day. We tried scheduling but often need to be made a week or two in advance.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Just got my beautiful 98 Ferrari F355 Berlinetta delivered back to my home after new engine and gearbox mounts and a muffler change out. So impressed with Jesse and Jim his Ferrari specialist. These guys are thorough with attention to detail, easy to communicate with, professional and the prices are fair for the work done.

Will definitely return for anything my Ferrari might need in the future.<//Text>

<Text>These guys are great. Jesse was super friendly, clear, and easy to work with when taking a car in for service. I was impressed and most importantly not stressed in the slightest, a nice thing when some shops dealing with higher-end Euro/Italian cars can seem annoyed you even called. Great work done in my experience.</Text><Name>Derek Mead< /Name></record>

I purchased by Ferrari 360 F1 Spider through SFMotorsports, and continue to bring it back for service.  They have performed the timing belt, header (removal/replacement), cats (removal/replacement), fluids, and other services.  The purchase process was easy, and the servicing has been performed with excellence.  I will continue to bring her back to them!< /Text>

My car is my baby. She has a name and is precious to me. When she needed a tuneup and brake job, Jesse was incredible. I was referred by a coworker. Turns out everyone in our office goes to Jesse! From my initial call, to his honest and fair assessment and fee, to the moment he delivered her to me: hands down the best shop I’ve had the pleasure to work with. I will never take her anywhere else.
If you love your car as much as I, do not hesitate to call SF Motorsports. You won’t find better service anywhere.
Thanks, Jesse and crew.<//text>

<review>Jessie and his team is world class and I mean world class. Their team helped us prep our car for the Ferrari National event this year and thanks to their efforts our car won the Platino Award, the Coppa Bella Mechina, and Coppa GT. They get a ton of credit for all of that.< /review>< pics>

I must say that I'm absolutely pleased with San Francisco Motorsports and Jesse.

I had an appointment with a different Auto Repair shop but decided to give Jesse (who spoke quite confidently and knowledgeably about repair and maintenance of foreign cars like mine) a benefit of the doubt - after all, how badly can one service a car?  Besides, he'd pick the car and drop off a loaner...really, of course, sure .

In the course of the day, I had a rundown/diagnostics on my car (some of which I was aware) and there was nothing that was done without my full consent and approval.

Needless to say, they were professional, explained and helped  to prioritize my required repair even with a picture sent to me, and delivered the car at my residence.  No ambiguity, no hassles, no hiccups....just a very pleasant and satisfying experience.  Hahahaha I called Jesse a "good omen"  - no heart feelings.

Cheers!<//text>

Doug and John are true enthusiasts. After semi-retired Brian Crall- the Ferrari author and guru of gurus- told me that the only person he would trust with his own car is John, I was a believer! John and Doug have both gone out of their way to be sure the maintenance on my car has been both convenient and obsessively performed to the point of perfection. Definitely two thumbs up!< /text>

I initially became aquainted with Jesse and SFMSS when my employer’s car required some custom work. I felt immediately taken care of and received excellent service including more than a few conseierge pick ups and drop offs. Jesse and his shop have kept this exceptional car in top form, and even helped us through a minor accident which has a lot of moving parts. This relationship has bloomed into a one stop shop for all of the family’s cars and  employee cars too, including myself. From simple pollen filter changes after the fires to major services. I couldn’t ask for a more honest and talented crew. I highly recommend SFMSS to anyone looking for top notch service and know how.<//Text>

<Review>The Doctor Makes House Calls???  2004 360 Modena issue suspension, analyzed and repaired!

"House Calls", almost unheard of these days, but Jessie came out to the house to help analyze an issue that seemed to represent itself turning out of the driveway going down hill.  After extensive diagnostics, the "sound" turned out to be a tie-rod end and not a wheel bearing, first suspect,  which would have been much more expensive.  The process, they replaced the wheel bearing which didn't solve the problem, the original bearing was refitted, I really appreciated not having to pay for something the car didn't need ... that's honesty and integrity in the repair process, plus excellent communications during the "noodling out" of the problem solving process.

In the end, excellent experience, took some time, and got it right!  5 Gold Stars to the SFMS team, on this project!

They're a full service shop, they "baby sat" my 360 Modena and XK8 Convertible for two months this summer while on vacation, the XK8 had some minor repairs done, so back home better than before.

In short, "Highly Recommended".

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>In a nutshell, if you are buying a car from these guys, I would be very weary of their ‘used car sales tactics’.  Given that they had decent reviews online, I was pretty shocked when having to deal with them.

So here’s my story.  I tried to buy a Scuderia from them (VIN ZFFKW64AX90166313).  Evan, their sales guy, was the epitome of a slimeball used car salesman.  He never called me back in a timely manner, jacked up the price using sob stories about how the owner does so much charity and how much he paid for the car.  On a used car, those things don’t matter.  The car is worth what it’s worth in the market.  Then, after I made concessions and we were moving to close the deal the next day, I started making plans to fly up.  He texts me late that evening and says he’s too busy with his family.  I don’t fault him for wanting to be with his family, but don’t lead me on by making me think that I should fly up only to change your mind later.  Usually a sales guy will bend over backwards if he has a potential sale especially as large as this and will sacrifice a couple hours on a weekend to close the deal.  Not Evan.
Then after using these delay tactics, he attempts to raise the price again saying the owner wants full asking price.  I told him, no one goes into the used car market to get full asking price on a car, especially a mass produced one.  If the owner wanted full asking price, he should have priced it $5-10k more than what was listed!  I came up a little more seeing that I didn’t want to lose this car over $1-2k and stipulated that the final price include shipping.  He comes back to me a day later and says, ‘We have a deal!  But I’m going to make an executive decision.  I’m going up a couple hundred dollars more since it’s essentially the same number.’  Executive decision?  Only a couple hundred more after I came up over $3 grand on a relatively very high mileage car that had been tracked numerous times and clearly showed signs of track wear?  Are you serious?  You can’t make this stuff up.  I ask about the shipping included that we had discussed.  He denied ever hearing about it.  Safe as to say, I did not buy the car from this sleazy character.  I have never seen a sales guy with such poor customer service and so unmotivated to sell a car.  His ‘used car salesman’ schemes were straight out of a movie.  I could not believe the nerve of this guy.

To be fair, I can’t speak about the mechanic services at SF Motorsports.  And they do seem to have good reputation in that regard which is very strange considering my horrendous experience.  But if you’re ever considering buying a high end vehicle from these characters, especially if you’re dealing with a guy named Evan, I WOULD BE VERY WEARY OF HIS SHENANIGANS.  It’s just not worth wasting your time with the games he plays.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Service is really friendly. Came in without reservation on a Saturday night and they kept apologizing for not having a seat available. Said that something would open up in 15 minutes and were very nice about it.

The patio is a nice surprise, next to a sculpture garden, creating some nice mid summer eve vibes. Patio is heated too for that off cold night.

Menu is simple but looks good.<//review>

Mexican food always seems to be good, this place is no exception.  The grilled fish tacos were great.  If you get a margarita get the regular one, the summer one tasted like cucumbers not as good.  I will go back, casual dining at a decent price.  The place always seems to be packed, also they have a patio out back which is usually full!</review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>I really liked the patio on the restaurant. Prices are reasonable and service is friendly enough without being overly intrusive. I got a burrito which really filled me up and was very delicious. Portions are probably not on the generous side but we got full enough with some tacos and my burrito.
Not sure if I was really hungry but I really enjoyed eating there. I think the waiter mentioned the chicken tacos were the most popular ones. Actually, I recall that the shrimp taco wasn't very good< /text>< Response>

The food here is OK. I ordered the shrimp tacos, and was not impressed with the quality. The tacos didn't taste bad, but they were definitely not worth the price. Additionally, the service was slow and scattered.<//Text>

Great burrito. I get grilled chicken and shrimp. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp-flavorless. but the chicken flavor was amazing!  Next time I'll go with just grilled chicken.  Fast, polite service.< /review>

Prices are wrong online. I ordered 3 shrimp tacos listed at $8.75 and 3 pork tacos listed at $5.75, went to pick up and they told me the price was incorrect and charged me $28.

I’ve eaten here many times before but not in a while. The shrimp tacos are really good but the tortillas were torn before even picking them up and the pork tacos were so bad and fatty I ended up throwing them away.

Basically, I paid close to $30 for a mess and 2 1/2 uneaten tacos.</review>

< Review>
Food was mediocre and service was terrible. I visited early on a Friday with my young child. The waitress was robotic at best and then told me that she was being forced to take a break after only coming to my table to robotically take my order. The next waiter didn’t come over until I waved at him to ask for the check. He did give me a discount which was appreciated. I have never actually complained about service at a restaurant so that should tell you how unwelcoming the waitress was. I will say the bus boys were quite friendly and helpful though. The patio is lovely and by far the best thing about this restaurant. The chips and salsa, which I had to order, came out on a plate along with three salsas- one pico de Gallo that was not very good, a green salsa that was okay but bland enough for my two year old to eat, and a brown one that I was afraid to try. I also got the salsa verde chicken enchiladas which were basically corn tortillas smothered in green sauce, and the cheese quesadilla (for $10) was thin and basic. Prices are too high here for the blandness of the food. I would not recommend.<//Review>

<Review>Horrible service. Pretty disorganize. Many servers waking around the bar, 50 minutes waiting for a cheese quesadilla and chicken burrito. They finally served a beef burrito wrapped in paper (we think it was to go and gave us for error). I ordered a tortilla soup that never came up!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

My friends and I went birding around Santa Monica/Venice area and happened upon Casa Linda when we needed to refuel. Casa Linda's decor is cute, authentic and colorful. I didn't even feel like I was on Abbot Kinney.

We each ordered 2-3 tacos a la carte, I asked for one asada and one chicken al pastor taco. Our table also ordered guacamole and chips (a must at any Mexican restaurant). The tacos were simple and delicious as they should be! Fresh cilantro and onion over diced seasoned meat on a bed of soft warm corn tortillas, I could eat 10 of these easily! The meat was well seasoned but not over salted, just right!

The guacamole was also very nice and savory. It was simple with diced tomato and onion mixed in mashed avocado. They could have provided more chips as the ratio of guac to chip was a bit unbalanced, but it ended up working out that we had extra guac left for our tacos! Not a bad deal.

Overall I enjoyed our rest stop at Casa Linda, it was perfect for refueling. After a beer and tacos we were ready to get back out there and enjoy the day.

Thanks, Casa Linda!< /Text>

Amazing!! They were cranking Biggie and Usher tunes with the bass turned up when we walked in, and then they rocked my face off with the most delicious food I've had in my 5 days in CA. Sangria, fish tacos, and the hamburgesa were the highlights for my group, but - seriously - everything was absolutely delicious.< /Text>

Delicious food! I work just around the corner and I go there often. Unfortunately they're pretty stingy. When I asked for extra pico de gallo. The cashier said I could trade my 2 salsas for the extra pico de gallo. Seriously! I have to substitute for salsa! OMG....</Text>

< Review>
This shopping center is still my first pick because they have all of the brands I'm looking for. I enjoyed a lot of time shopping and I felt at ease with the attendants who kept me entertained. They are all friendly and accommodating!<//Review>

<text>Park on the street. Avoid parking here, it's the biggest rip off. I had to use the ATM. In the few minutes or took me, it cost $3 to park. Most garages will give you at least 15 minutes free. Going to a movie will cost something like $35. Also, there's NOTHING here other than a theatre and Cheesecake Factory. This place is a ghost town.<//text>< Pictures>

I had to go the the Sherman Oaks Galleria to use the ATM. It was so desolate. But, for a couple of people, the place is deserted. A few of the places are still open. Like a few restaurants and the Icecream shop. But, it did make it easier and made me feel safe while I walked through.< /text>

Worth watching. Nice place to spend time. Surrounded with shopping places,restaurants. Along with this they have too many activities like ferries​,boat which can take you for ride. Good place to enjoy the evening and feel the nature.< /text>

Check out 24 Hour Fitness Gym. Messaging shower head in ladies' locker room. Wonderful. Paul Mitchell School is a great place to have your hair pampered and fabulous place to absorb new and trendy fashion about your hair. Wonderful anti-hair loss products for your honey. If you are tight in schedule, great place to have all your beauty essentials done @ Galleria. Online appointment with European Wax Center. Appointments or walk-in @ Paul Mitchell School, which is a great trendy place to help and learn from aspiring beauticians. Then hit the gym @ 24 Hours. You can always modify the sequence of your appointments according to your schedule and preferences of action. PS...the estheticians @ European Wax suggested to finish steam room, which is my favorite activity @ gym, before going to their stores for services. Since pores are open after steam, it's not recommend to perform waxing procedures on skin because the likelihood of having infections at the open follicle pores. Steam treatment before waxing also helps hair removal. I guess less painful during waxing.❤️🈵❤️<//text>

The Sherman Oaks Galleria was very cool to walk around in. It's a very nice outdoor mall with a lot of different stores and dining options. We went at night and everything was lit up extremely nicely. The fountain was also pretty awesome and it went with music. We went to a bunch of the pastry shops, as we were really there to look, not shop.<//text>

Beautiful, four building office complex with a shopping center and lots of water features. The center includes a few uniquely stocked stores and several upscale chain restaurants, some with patio seating.

There is a Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Shop, offering vegan and conventional ice cream, and other counter restaurants.

A multi-screen movie palace, on the third floor, is excellent and has a good sit-down restaurant. Popcorn, too.

Attendant and validated self parking available.

Restaurants and the movie house validate. Most places offer some vegan and gluten free foods. Elevators and escalators are available throughout including the multi-story garage. Everything is wheelchair accessible.<//Review>

These are Clean theaters and they never reek of stale dead air like many other theaters!  Clean bathrooms to boot, a nice bar w/ small meals and seating overlooking the 405 parking lot 😂 Friendly staff and free parking, just remember 2 get it stamped. This small chain is above most other cinemas, a good experience!< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
An almost useless mall. The restaurants have limited views and the street noise from Ventura is annoying, even indoors. There's next to nothing to do there. Lots of kids all the time. Parking is in the back across from nearly everything worthwhile so it's a long walk to nothing. The only things with going to are cheesecake factory, DSW, and the arclight theater. After living next door to this mall and expecting it to be a fun place to go, I've gone 3 times and every time has been a disappointment. Go across the street to Public School instead.</review>

Sherman Oaks Galleria is a cool place that has been really updated over the years. I've been coming here since I was a kid and they have made major improvements. There is definitely so much to find and do here.< /Review>

<review>I'm a country girl so this big theater is fun to learn to navigate. It's organized very well. The seats are comfortable. but back home seeing this movie would have cost me $15 for two people and here it cost $30. And if you get valet parking the charges $9 and on top of that you tip the valet so it's pretty expensive to go there< /review><gmap_id>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0<//gmap_id>< Date>

Not very interesting! Has some restaurants, but not enough shops. Could really be better than what it is.< /text>

Review for a tourist:
Neat to visit for nostalgia’s sake if you’re an 80’s kid. Pretty unrecognizable though, as it was semi-demolished and rebuilt. Cheesecake Factory was delightful. Not many shops. Tip: bring your parking ticket with you and most places will validate. Saves some $$.< /Review>

When the earthquake happened and this mall fell apart I was hoping they would rebuild another mall there because it was really quite beautiful. Now they have cheesecake factory and a couple other restaurants and a DFW shoes.... For those of you that are disabled it's a long walk from the parking lot to restaurants or down stairs they have a furniture store or 2... And then of course the cheesecake factory which no matter how much you have to struggle is worth the effort because their food is always yummy and even if you split a desert you won't forget it< /text>

<Text>It's been 20+ years since I was last there. It looks awesome, wonderful, excellent. However I don't think it serves the clientel of old....like me. The upgraded look is Awesome, but it's just too high scale for me. Makes me wonder if THIS was what they envisioned all along. But kudos it's 10/10.<//Text>< date>

Not really a shopping Galleria.
They have DSW & a Theatre (Cinema), then a gym & businesses. That's it.
Now the outside walk is pretty with your choice of restaurants.</Review>

More of a work place than a mall. However, there is a couple of places to shop, like DSW. There is a few restaurants, like PF CHANGS, Cheesecake Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings and more.

I work  in the Galleria and everything is very nice and staff is attentive. i appreciate management for all its help<//text>

The movie theater is very nice tho, I'd recommend anyone go see a movie in there and then check out the city on the overpass when you get outta the theatre.

<resp>None< /resp><review>I enjoy coming here for a movie and dinner. The arclight theater itself is expensive, but it includes selected seats. The home furniture is also nice to walk around in. I never drive here myself and don't know the intricacies of parking but I know they do validate for 2 or 3 hours. I'm not sure if the theater validates or if it's just free for the first 2 to 3 hrs.</review>< Name>

Parking is expensive and so is valet so be prepared.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>The parking sucks. That is my biggest complaint. You get 4 hours free if you watch a movie, (2 hours everywhere else) but if you put your ticket in the machine you literally have 20 mins to leave, or sit in line to leave, or they will charge you $3.00. I know it doesn't seem like a lot but it is the principal.<//review>< date>

Best thing going for this place is the Arclight Cinema. Food choices are forgettable in my opinion. Parking isn't super convenient but there's also DSW, Burke Williams Spa and 24 Hour Fitness.< /text>

This mall is dying. Half the stores are empty. There is very little shopping stores. Mostly chain restaurants. Nothing special. The parking rates are egregious. Got a coupon to visit the indoor playground, but with those parking rates, it would have been cheaper to pay full price elsewhere.</review>

This is such a beautiful spot. Really nice to hang out with family, friends, or even have a date night. My friends and I come here when we want to hang out. The vibe is very chill. You can do some shopping, go to the movies, eat, or take a stroll. Really great environment and people are nice too.< /Review>

No more parking attendant at the booth. Please pay your parking using those machines. Super convenient. Easier and faster to get out the parking structure.

Higher levels always have parking spots near elevator.< /text>

<Text>This is very different from the Sherman oaks Galleria 20 years ago. now there are mostly restaurants that line this narrow shopping mall along side office buildings. Usually people come here to go to The cheesecake factory. Are also children's events every weekend. During the daytime many people go to the go to the gym, 24-Hour fitness. There's also a very expensive movie theater upstairs call the ArcLight theater. Parking is fairly reasonable although if you stay for a longer, they charge you.< /Text>< Pics>

This is supposed to be considered a mall I believe. You must come here for a destination, not really due to convenience. Movie theater, cheesecake factory, P.F Chang's, Starbucks, and Buffalo wild wings are the main stops that everyone comes for. 2 clothing stores, a shoe store and a couple others things reside at the galleria but nothing that gets more than 10 customers a day I'm sure. Overall, clean and classy.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I have not been too this Mall for many years....1980's!  Parking looks easy. Until you actually have to park. You have to walk a long, long, long, long way thru the entire mall. I get it....they want you to check out the stores. But then you have to go through a wind tunnel. The theater also was very dirty! I would never go back....Not worth the time & effort!<//review>

Very clean and nice. Parking is expensive but it's validated for few hours if you watch a movie or eat at the restaurants. Huge parking structure so there are plenty of parking spaces, but expect LA pricing if you do not validate< /text>

<Text>Don't waste your time, Westfield is just down the street, and actually has places to eat. Unless you're seeing a movie, the parking structure isn't worth the hassle.

<Review>I love coming here for my morning workout at 24hr. Fitness then breakfast at Starbucks, sometimes for lunch at smaller restaurant or dinner at larger sites such as Cheesecake Factory! I love their community room for pubic use, outside seating, and free 2hr-3hr. Parking. Very chill spot! Hope one day they can add a yardhouse or brewery like restaurant.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Thrilled to see 3 new restaurants coming in soon.  This is primarily a dinner and movie place, so the more food choices, the better.  The wind tunnel journey from the parking lot to the theaters is brutal on cold days but a godsend on hot ones ☺<//Text>

This is where I usually workout at 24 hour fitness so I spend a lot of time here... The other shops are ok. Would like to see a few more but the restaurants are Great ! Very good variety of styles and all have been really good so far in all ways. Parking is free for 2 hours with validation from any place you go and Valet parking makes it even more convenient. Plenty of outdoor seating also ! Enjoy... Aloha<//Text>

They are so cool, modern, password protected and free! I got lots of samples at the mall, was happy with my daughter who loved our shopping experience and after visiting several stores, we did not find one store sales rep that was rude. My new favorite shopping mall for sure!< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

While it may not be as grandiose as some of the other Gallerias of Los Angeles Area, the Sherman Oaks Galleria has a memorable aesthetic.
From the water fountains providing calming sound throughout, the Hanukkah lights illuminating Ventura Blvd. during the holiday season, or the Arclight Cinema overlooking the 405 freeway's daily hectic races, the Sherman Oaks Galleria leaves it's mark at the gateway to the San Fernando Valley.<//review>

I actually went there for the gym. I really like the area. I don't like the gym being inside. One thing parking sucks. Other thing is that 24hr fitness validates for 2 hrs only so you have to rush to get your workout in. But in general the area and location is very clean. The. Galleria has plenty of restaurants to chose from. A little bit of everything.< /Text>

<Review>Given the name galleria I assumed this was a shopping mall. It is not. It is a strip of upscale restaurants and a Warner Bros Office. What the hell....? 12 dollars per hour for parking also. I ❤️ L.A.< /Review>< gmapID>

A large, fairly new and open outdoor galleria. Lots of shops and a decent number (and variety) of restaurants to meet many different tastes and occasions. Its parking structures are also easy to navigate, though parking can be moderately expensive (though often can be taken care of by restaurants).<//review>

S.O is my hometown and I've been coming here for a long while. I even worked at this place in HS.

Everything you need from comfort food to a restaurant to a bar exists here +some other misc stuff.

Theater is a bit expensive but the 24hr gym makes up for it (cleanest 24 in the city IMO) and parking is reasonable with validation....the only way it could get better is if validation from the gym added an extra hour</Review>

Nice selection of places to eat: It includes the Archlight Cinema, Cheesecake Factory, T-Mobile, and more. Since the Galleria became an outdoor shopping center, it has become the place to stroll in the summer evening and if looking for something to do: the mall offers outdoor concerts during the summer months.</review>

Not the best mall in LA. There isn’t that much shopping. There are a few restaurants and a good movie theater. I give it four stars because I like the ArcLight movie theater and the location is pretty central to me and my friends.<//text>

Nice selection of places to eat: It includes the Archlight Cinema, Cheesecake Factory, T-Mobile, and more. Since the Galleria became an outdoor shopping center, it has become the place to stroll in the summer evening and if looking for something to do: the mall offers outdoor concerts during the summer months.< /Review>

<Review>Bottom floor has a few restaurants but that's all that's worth exploring unless you're going to the movies. The Mexican restaurant (I forgot the name) was good. Great service.

It's a decent mall. It's got what you need but The Grove is better. However parking here is superior to anything in Beverly Hills or Hollywood.</Review>

Nice outdoor shopping center. Plenty of eateries to choose from. Seems to be a mix of working business class people from the various onsite office  buildings, trendy shoppers and people going to/from the onsite gym. The architecture of the location is pretty nice as well. Worth a stroll through if your looking for something to do. Parking prices are a bit much, but I guess that's to be expected for the area.</text>

<text>Better for dinner and a movie than shopping, though I have found a cute thing or two in a couple of the boutiques and I'm glad there's a DSW here! Last time my husband and I came we saw "It," though I have seen many movies here over the years. The customer service at the Arclight is fantastic and the whole cinema is very comfortable. Also, if you don't prefer to dine in the Galleria itself (which can seem kind of empty/lonely on account of the lack of active storefronts) there are other restaurants close by on Ventura.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Highly recommend the galleria...even if your alone it is in the middle of an always busy mall busy with bustling busy people ...great for mingling or people watching;) the galleria is also has many offices in and surroundind the the  Galleria. It’s a very popular lunch destination for many of these people who work there. Lost of shops and restaurants both fast food and family style.
Newest add into the Glendale galleria restaurants is Frida Mexican restaurant....Yummmmm. Also included in the line up is The Cheesecake Factory...PF Chang’s...pizza 90...and many more they even have a gym If you need to work off some of that lunch or dinner! Great experience ...great ambiance great food and drinks!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

This galleria is great for high end food. It's doesn't have many stores but they have a few decent restaurants like P.F. Changs, Cheesecake Factory and Buffalo Wild Wings. To top the night off, you can head to the upper floors and watch films at the Arclight. Great theater but a bit pricey. Overall it's s great place if you trying to make a first impression.</text>

<review>I've always wanted to like the Galleria more but it's always been just OK.  There are some OK restaurants.  The Arclight is already dated compared to newer theaters, and the parking is plentiful though getting out can be a chore.  I do love that they have valet. When you are running late it's the way to go.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0</gmapID></record>

From sandwiches to wings to cheesecake to Mexican cuisine, there are a bunch of different food options if you are looking for a quick bite for lunch or a nice dinner with the family. There is also a 24 Hour fitness, an ArcLight Movie theater, and DSW. The Sherman Oaks Galleria is a one stop shop that will cover many of your needs.<//review>

There is not much to do, the parking is hastle and very crowded. Not too many stores, there is a cheesecake factory which is always busy, if that's what you like, on the top there are theatres that are very expensive, It is very cold and depressing place.< /review>

Not great for shopping. This place is more for private business, few places to eat, quick and sit down restraunts. Jersey Mike's, Philadelphia Cheesestack with provolone cheese pretty good.< /review>

Do not take any valuables into the gym, my locker as well as for other blockers were broken into. What's funny I think the employees there open the lock when someone said there lock didn't open, and didn't register the person's name. That's what I was told by a person who I ran into later on a week later who was present at the time my locker was broken into. This locker Room is unsafe, no security whatsoever to protect your personal belongings, I lost over $400 .

Again this 24 hour fitness is not a safe place to store anything, even in your clothing. All someone has to do is tell the employee they can't get into their locker, an employee will break the lock and not log the name or verify the locker belongs to the person they are opening the locker for.<//Review>

Definitely the best location just on the 405 and the 101 is not a better location than this place !!! Unfortunately the parking doesn't manage right and they have valet in the parking lot . Other than this everything is great ! Please note this place almost have no stores so don't go there for shopping this place is mainly to see movies and restaurants</review>

Do not take any valuables into the gym, my locker as well as for other blockers were broken into. What's funny I think the employees there open the lock when someone said there lock didn't open, and didn't register the person's name. That's what I was told by a person who I ran into later on a week later who was present at the time my locker was broken into. This locker Room is unsafe, no security whatsoever to protect your personal belongings, I lost over $400 .

Again this 24 hour fitness is not a safe place to store anything, even in your clothing. All someone has to do is tell the employee they can't get into their locker, an employee will break the lock and not log the name or verify the locker belongs to the person they are opening the locker for.< /text>

Nice place, clean. Parking structure smells like pukes though, and I wish valet would open earlier. Nice staff too.</Review>

I live next door to it... nice and open. I like going to 24 hour fitness, Starbucks, and DSW, Hanna Grill, Buffalo wild wings . This place is not the place to go for shopping unless you are a size -0 and like women's boutique shops.<//text>

The Sherman Oaks Galleria has so much to offer!  It’s a one stop shopping, dinner, events and movies. One of the newest places there is L.A.’s newest children’s indoor playground & party space located inside the Sherman oaks galleria.  Arclight Cinemas is more than a place to see a movie; it is an experience! Before the movie go to the Arclight Cafe and they have a full menu of both food and cocktails. It also has a 24 Hour Fitness, Cheesecake Factory restaurant and DSW- Designer Shoe Warehouse!  During the holidays they have fun events for the kids too!<//review>

Not a typical mall with all your chain stores, but certainly lovely if you're just looking for a movie and some grub. ... Or home goods, a gym, waxing or a beauty school. A quite random, glorified strip mall.</Review>

Validated parking is good. Also convenient place for a gym. However, not much else besides the arclight and a few restaurants.</text>

<Review>It's pretty, but there aren't too many shops and the places you actually want to get to are far way from the parking garage. That being said, the places they do have (ArcLight, Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang's) are all good. I'm sad El Torito is no longer there; it's absence is definitely felt.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0<//gmap_id><Time>1481653854181<//Time>< pictures>

<text>Sherman Oaks Galleria was the mall that made "Valley Girls" famous back in the 80's. Since then it has been redesigned as an outdoor mall that features ArcLight theatres, The Cheesecake Factory, and 24-Hour Fitness.

The parking is a little challenging here but they do offer valet parking as an alternative. If you are willing to pay more for parking,  you can avoid the hassle of parking your car.

Most of the restaurants and ArcLight theatres validate for regular parking for the first 2 hours.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Parking is always pretty easy and available, except during busy shopping holidays. I go there for the Arclight Cinema and Happy Hours in the restaurants downstairs if there's time before the movie, plus there's 4 hour parking validation. As long as you avoid traffic hour it's pretty easy to get there, but since it sits at the intersections of Ventura Blvd & Sepulvida Blvd and Ventura and San Diego freeways, you never know so check traffic or Google Maps before you go.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Aside from the Arclight theater, you have 3 or 4 dining options and a 24 hour fitness. Very nice mall but not one that you go to for window shopping.</Review>

Saw it off the freeway and thought it was a mall. Stopped by and quickly discovered it was not. Left within 5 minutes of entering, and was charged parking despite explaining the mixup to the attendant. Don't waste your time, this place is a joke.<//review>

< review>
Went to meet friends at Cheesecake Factory for lunch. When I went to pay for my validated parking it was $14. I called the assistance button and Maria told me to cancel it and tell her what the validation code was. When I told her it was Cheesecake Factory she said ok put it back in. When I did it was $16 and she told me if I kept talking it would just go up. When I talked to her supervisor he said just to pay it and leave. Seriously? I don't even pay that for high interest parking. What in the world is the galleria doing charging those rates. They told me it was because they charge the corporate businesses that amount so they have to charge the shoppers that too.</review>

Ive always loved the Galleria. Their PF Changs is the best in the valley, and it is always fun to head over to 24 Hour Fitness.< /text>

Arrows leading to handicap parking at valet entrance are non-existent. Slim store selection. If you just want something to eat or to see a movie (a very expensive movie), this is the place to visit. The old newsstand is long gone, as are all the little n8che stores. You can, however, eat at Freshland, PF Chang's, Japanese fast food, erc.</Text>

A great place to meet with friends and relatives. If you play Pokémon go, has more than a few pokestops. Is always a safe place when the sun goes down<//text>

<Review>The high point here is the Arclight Cinema.  The rest is meh restaurants, a beauty college and a gym.  There is good parking that most businesses validate.< /Review>< Rate>

<review>I always tell my wife that this is a sad excuse for a mall.  The only places that make this worth going to are Cheesecake Factory and Arclight Theaters.  And while waiting for a table at Cheesecake, we wander to DSW.  When we have the $$$, we also go to Burke Williams, but that is special occasion only.  There's a gym there, so that always makes parking "interesting" too.  All in all, it's ok.  I go there, but for only for specific reason.< /review>< Pictures>

Nothing too great here.  Food places are all decent,  Arclight is on the lower end of the scale as far as Arclight's go. Everything is pricey because of its location.</text>

Dining options are highlighted by a Cheesecake Factory, PF Chang's, Buffalo Wildwings, and Starbucks. The restaurants are good and consistent with their other locations.

Big box retailers include DSW, Urban Home. The theather is an Archlight and is not normally too busy. The theather has reserved seating and is a good place to see a movie as there are not many theather options in Sherman Oaks.

The reason why 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because of the parking. It is located at the far end of the Galleria and is not free.</review>< Pics>

From the top of the parking lot off of Sepulveda Ave., you can see for miles and watch airliners land and launch from nearby Burbank Airport, and even attend collage at DeVry University just off the food court near Starbuck's.  Drive from here either direction on Ventura Ave or continue south on Sepulveda for a wide selection of restaurants, bars, and businesses along one of the longest city streets in Los Angeles.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I only go to this outdoor mall for very specific reasons e.g. seeing a movie at Arclight, going to Cheesecake Factory, etc. There are not enough shops here to just go walking around to shop, and the large parking structure with many levels and paid ticket parking makes the barrier to entry that much higher.</Text>

It still reminds me of working at the theaters when they were filming Valley Girl and Terminator, so it'll always hold a special 'hang out' spot in my heart...but what they've done to it now, (making it an outdoor mall),...I'd rather drive to fashion square (which is now an indoor mall)< /Text>

This is a fairly small location, with some good restaurants and offerings, but very scant offerings in terms of clothing, electronics, or toys.

The location is very good, right at the intersection of the 405, Sepulveda Blvd, and Ventura Blvd, and the mall manages to make what is objectively a very small space felt bigger. Still, the lack of space means there are no department or big box stores whatsoever. Instead, I would recommend either the Westfield which is off of Riverside and Hazeltine or the Northridge Fashion Center which is farther at Tampa Ave and Nordhoff Street but has a great selection.

Be sure to check if the stores you visit offer parking validation, as parking is not free at the Galleria.< /Text>

Sure this place is fancy, but all I do here is work out at 24. Unfortunately they only validate parking for 2 lousy hours. After sprinting to my car Im literaly a minute early and the parking attendant lady of course had a language barrier problem... and takes her sweet time walking out of her booth and taking my ticket. SOMEHOW I'm a minute late and decides to charge me. This crap happens all the time. All those dollars add up to precious yogurtland trips.<//text>

Awkwardly located on the corner of Ventura Blvd and Sepulveda Blvd and backed up to the 405, Sherman Oaks Galleria somehow survives.  As far as malls go, it's alright.  The Galleria is located just north of the 101 and 405 merge, and getting to it can painful, depending on time of travel.  Avoid mornings and evenings and it won't hurt as much.  Parking is awful.</Text>
