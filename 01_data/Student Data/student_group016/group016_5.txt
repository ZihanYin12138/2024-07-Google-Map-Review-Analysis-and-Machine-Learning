If there is anything  that needs done or fixed or anything at all, they take care of  it quickly and hassel free. I have mainly  spoken with Tammy  through everything since the beginning and she is just amazing! Very genuine, kind, super helpful and supportive!

<text>DO NOT!! I repeat DO NOT waste your time or money doing business with these people. The lady (Joan) will scam you out of your application fees knowing fully well that these properties are already taken. She'll call you the day before your "supposed" move-in date with some cockamamie story of an oversight and a pathetic apology. It's just a scam to collect & rack up application fees!! 90% of their so-called "AVAILABLE" properties have already been rented out WEEKS prior!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I recently moved out from the house that I rented through Valley fair Realty I was there for about three years and during the time I was there they were great! If I had any maintenance needs at all I would just call them in and they would get taken care of very quickly and upon move out I received almost all my deposit back and what I didn’t receive they noted very clearly why it was taken out. As long as you take care of the property you’re staying in you should have no issues I would definitely rent from them again in the future if I needed to.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>I would never recommend Valley Fair to anyone.

We rented from them for five years.

Never had a walk through do to COVID-19

They charged us 16 man hours of cleaning/repairs at 70.00 bucks an hour.

Sidenote I never once dealt with Valley Fair for repairs. Only the landlord, because he didn't want to get  charged by Valley Fair. Which I see why.

They capitalize on people in dire situations which is almost criminal.< /Text>< user>

From the very beginning the staff has been nothing but extremely professional and helpful. Especially Tammy in leasing. Going from being homeowners to renters was a bit of a challenge  and such a huge change but I am so thankful to have rented from VFRC. We have been in our rental for a few years now and have never had a single issue that was not addressed immediately and professionally. I highly recommend using VFRC for all of your realty needs.<//text>< Pics>

Moved out on May 6.  Had carpets and tiles professionally cleaned, as well as windows washed.  Entire interior cleaned as I would in the past for a military move.

After calling and emailing multiple times asking for status of my security deposit, finally received today, May 26. They charged me $317.32 in damages out of $900.00.

The break down?
Replace burn out bulb in living room: $24.00
Rescreen window in bedroom:. $82.00
Cleaning:. $120.00
Carpet cleaning:. $90.00
, Tax on materials $17.32

IF you have any business with these people, I strongly suggest that you photograph EVERYTHING and ask someone to witness the conditions of move in and move out.</Text>

Poor customer service / charges $40 application fee per adult even when it only cost them $1.50 at the most with their membership.  That's $80 per couple just to apply!  Applied, and asked beforehand if the place was still available, and was told yes, 30 minutes later called back and was told it had already been leased.  They won't return your fees stating "we already spent the money on your background check" but they do tell you it's good for 6 months.  I'm sure this has become standard policy for a lot of Realtors these days.  Don't get the need to pay just to be considered for a chance to look at a rental, but I can see where they can make a lot of money off of doing that.  It felt very dishonest, and not a company I would ever trust again.<//text>

Then the hourly wage for the workers that go out to do repairs went from $65/hr. to $70/hr. So while they have not raised the rent on my tenants they do it to me.

They never answer their phones or respond to emails to answer basic questions about their listings. I have a feeling I’m going to get ripped off going through them based on their lack of professionalism and everyone else’s opinion of them as well. It’s a shame they have so many properties listed in the area.< /text>

<review>We waited over a week, paid $70 to apply to a home in Plumas Lake, were told everything was fine so we put in notice to our current landlord, and then was told that “Sorry we already rented that out since we hadn’t received your verifications in time”. We had applied only a week ago and it was Christmas! Not to mention that I was told by the assistant that the house was ours if everything was verified. So now we’re out $70 (with no offer to refund), and were offered to apply to no pets properties even though our application clearly states pets. Waste of our time and now we have no home as of 30 days.<//review>< gmap_id>

Very poor property management services. The one thing they do well is collect their management fee, but if you’re an owner, find another firm to represent you.< /Text>

<Review>Today was our first ever experience with Valley Fair Realty.  The receptionist was absolutely wonderful!  She was very sweet and very kind. She allowed us to check out some keys to go look at apartments.  When we got back, we informed them that we had two cats.  Unfortunately, none of the places we looked at would allow pets at all, but instead of just saying they couldn't help us, the receptionist mentioned a place that would be opening up soon that allowed pets, took down our number and promised to call.  I love that we weren't just turned away. Valley Fair Realty didn't give up on us.  I HIGHLY recommend them!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Huge joke! I didn't live there personally, (Rameriz Apartments) but I had taken care of someone who does. Getting a hold of them to fix something is easy, but fixing it right is a joke.

The people who work at Valley Fair are really nice, and sweet. You have to go there and pay the rent.< /text>

I have rented my whole life, been through several property management's, but I have to say that valley fair has been one of the most diligent and sufficient agencies yet. Repairs seem like one thing after the other, but they are very prompt and do a great job. Dwaina and Tammy really go out of they're ways to accommodate tenants issues or concerns.
I highly recommend, they're easy to work with!</review>

They were quick and efficient. We were on a time crunch because my brother works out of town during the week. We dropped off his application on Wednesday and we had an approval by Friday. My brother was able to get off early on Friday and come sign the lease and get the keys. Anna was very kind and worked with us to get him in the perfect house. We highly recommend going through Valley Fair Realty!

< Review>
Valley Fair managed my rental professionally.  They handled issues that arose with tenants promptly and kept my property rented when tenants moved.  I have also used them to sell my property which sold and completed escrow in a record 14 days!  I have also rented from them.  I would recommend their services to anyone in the Yuba Sutter area.<//Review>

<review>I enjoyed my experience with Valley Fair Realty in finding a rental home.  Anna was a joy to work with.  My application was approved expeditiously and they even allowed us into the house earlier than anticipated.  I highly recommend using Valley Fair Realty if you are in need of a rental home.

I own 2 rental homes that Valley Fair Realty manages.  I have been extremely happy with the service I have received.  The receptionist is very helpful, they maintain the property, they get excellent tenants and they get my funds to me quickly.  What I like best though is that they keep me informed.</text>

<text>I moved into one of Valley fair's rental apartments almost a year ago. My experience has been wonderful so far. The apartment complex is clean and well maintained, as is the apartment its self. When maintenance is needed, you just call and they come in a timely manner and are always very friendly. The office staff is also wonderful, they are friendly,helpful and always polite.<//text>< user_name>

Worst property management. Bought a house lived in for a year, they tried to repersent both home owner and us, even know we didn't even need a realtor. Then when didn't repersent either of us they became difficult at best to deal with. I would not recommend at all.<//review>

They have managed out property for the past three years and it has been nothing short of wonderful!  They keep us well informed as the homeowner.  We have never had to worry about anything.  If any issues come up they contact us immediately and work out a way to solve the problem.  They don't blind side us with unexpected fees.  They are always courteous to work with and always return our phone calls.  They have a high expectation from the tenants as well. We could not be happier with the service we have gotten!<//review>

Spoke to a very unprofessional Tamilynn and was constantly interrupted, asked for a manager and got a very aggressive man or woman by the same of Dwayna or Dwayne who felt it was proper to speak down to someone who could be a potential client. Very classless office staff, uneducated and tacky. Glad to not do business with this establishment.</text>

Terrible service, they are mismanaged and are  so unorganized. In the dead of winter it took 16 days before they fixed my heater for my family with two small kids. 11 of those days were trying to figure out who's insurance was going to pay for it, while my family froze at night. My air conditioner is out now and will be waiting 2 days is what they say right now, before they fix it. The high for today is 108 not too fun. These people can't manage themselves let alone tenants.</review>

So this is going to be long but I rented from them for about 21/2 years and they really screwed us over. During the time that we lived there we had many problems with our duplex and we called and reported the problems to have them fixed and not one time in the two and a half years that we lived there did they come out and fix anything that I had complained about and then on top that off some of those problems ruined a bunch of of my personal belongings and then to top things off even more when we moved out they blamed us for those problems saying that those problems weren't there when we moved in and I said yeah I know they weren't there when I moved in we reported them to you and you never came and fixed them and and they said we have no record of you reporting anything wrong. then to top that off I cleaned up all the house very spotless did everything I can't I could to deposit back because I really thought we were going to we had only messed up just a few things in the house and they were only minor fixes so I thought wholeheartedly they were going to give us something back however I was completely wrong in that as they ended up charging us $1,000 on top of taking our $750 deposit for literally things like I left a a fly catcher up in the kitchen and that was like 10 dollars of work to take down apparently or that I left the shower curtain in the shower and that took 30 min of labor to remove.and I didn't change the batteries in the smoke detectors and they charged us at least like $100 for each of these minor minor things to be fixed nothing was ever seriously broken and on top of that right after we moved out of there we lost our oldest son and had to bury him on his 2nd birthday so we were already struggling financially from having to afford our sons Funeral expenses and we had just bought a house. They were fully aware of our situation and I asked them if there was anything I could do to fix anything or have something reduced and they never even bothered to respond and basically just told us that we were s*** out of luck and they didn't really care what kind of problems that my family was going through. I recommend never renting there, they are completely all about themselves and the money you're putting in their pockets. They don't have a care in the world for you and your families well-being all they care about is your money becoming their money and it really just got to me that they went so low over $1,000 that my family really could have used at that time bit it's just pocket change to their business. That was our families experience and I personally would recommend that you NEVER move your family into one of their homes unless you have too much money to spend because they will definitely screw you over in the end and you would definitely have to pay the money at the end no matter how much you do to fix your house up I literally left my house in better condition than when we moved in there and I was completely blown away that I owed them $1,000 on top of them taking my $750 deposit already. I hope this helps somebody out there thank you for your time. I usually don't do stuff like this lol<//text>

People don't call you back, even after leaving multiple voicemails. Had an application in for a week, go to the first  viewing and after viewing call to notify them I will take it and they tell me it was rented 5 minutes ago. Don't trust them.< /Text>

<Text>Valley Fair have been trying to rip me off over 400$. They cant explain where they spent these 13 hours of labor and we have been going back and forth for over two weeks. If you are thinking about using them run the other way. Nona is the most unproffesional person i have delt with ever and her supervisor Barbara is not much better. Extremely dissatisfied with this company.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

The store front is located past the Disney car lot boom gate and too the right, so don't be confused.

They accept late drop offs.

We've used them for years. Never a problem, the same process you see for every other rental place.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< rate>

Small office in Paradise Pier hotel. Only one person working and several in line. The rental went well. Drop off could be easier though. Was advised to prepay a half tank of gas and then only used 1/4 and was offered no difference. Everything seemed to work out. Could have been a little better though.< /Review>

Can be a bit tricky to find if you didn't originally rent the car from this location. You have to park in the downtown Disney parking lot and try to find a spot. Can be very hard if you're returning during busy hours when the Downtown Disney lots are full. I would recommend returning to another location. Most of the pictures and reviews here are for a different location. This review is for 1565 s Disneyland Dr. Wasted 2 hours of my time trying to return here.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZgW2HGKH7zCDmPLAUl3l2TV8yQftZLVk8NNZm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

We reserved our rental over the phone and were NOT told we would have to have a credit card to swipe to pick up the rental. They would not swipe the debit card we used to reserve the rental with. Ridiculous!!! DO NOT RENT FROM ALAMO! The employee and supervisor could care less - rules are rules. We sat for 4 hours with 4 kids and all of our luggage until my husband could get an Uber and secure another vehicle 20 minutes away with a local Hertz who had no problem using our debit VISA.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!</Review>

This was my first trip to California and to Disneyland.  It couldn't have been any easier to make the 5 minute walk down to the Alamo Rent A Car from the hotel and pick up our rental car.  The agent was extremely friendly and graciously upgraded our vehicle without our even asking.  I would recommend this location to anyone staying at any of the Disneyland Resorts in Anaheim.<//Review>

Excellent staff and very good experience. Got a great deal as well.
I forgot to fill up the fuel while returning (I used only 1/4th of the tank anyways) and the staff was kind enough to let it go as I was in hurry. Very nice experience overall. One of the staff member treated us like a family and made us laugh a lot!!</Review>

Great experience! Extremely nice staff in Downtown Disney. No transfer fee from northern California to this location during the Thanksgiving rush!

It would have been extremely hard to find if I hadn't done a lot of research before hand. I am writing this review to help others find the location. The staff explained to me that Disney does not allow them to put any signs to find the parking lot. You have to enter off of Disneyland Drive. I came in from the south off of Katella. It is the first light with a road sign that says Paradise Pier with an arrow to the left. Just tell the cast member at the guard shack that you are there to drop off a car and he will let you through. They will open up the gate just passed the guard shack on the right where you drop the car. You park in the lot directly south of the AMC Theatre.<//review>

Returned vehicle here.  Employees were rude.  You have to enter a gated lot with a Disney attendant, he was happy to let us on and give us a general idea of where to take the car, but there were no signs nor labelled spots, and no signs on how to find the office from the lot.   We arrived about 5 minutes before they opened in the morning.  Two employees were moving cars around, the first one saw me waiting to ask a question, so quickly pulled out her phone and pretended to take a phone call (hah!, as if anyone talks on cell phones anymore).  It would have been more believable to pretend to be absorbed in creating a Snapchat of yourself and titling it "awesome customer service".  The other employee tried to make a getaway behind the cars, no such luck, I caught him.  He brought me over to the office, and opened the door, but then someone inside yelled at him to keep us out, they weren't open yet (at 7:58am).  Shrug.  Dropped keys though hole in the door.... what was the big deal?< /Review>

Hi,
I read some of the negative comments on here and still decided to keep my reservation - it was a big mistake!

Alamo had responded on some of these comments, so I "assumed" all concerns were addresses, but once again we were WRONG!

Took a car for 2 hours to drive it one way to the airport. The gas level was not noted on the contract, so I assumed it was documented in the computer. I took it 1/4 full and returned it with a 1/4 tank more (1/2 tank full). I asked them about the gas level not being noted on the contract, and I was told that it should have been full when I checked out the car and I should have returned it full!!!! I said that's fine, but then I realized there was a  milage discrepancy. The mileage on my contract was about 200 less than what it should have been. Long story short.....in 2 hours.... It showed that I had driven the car for over 300 miles. I spoke to a manager but I was shocked how this situation was handled! First time with this company and probably last! In a few days you might see a comment from Alamo car company addressing this issue, but I'll update this post myself if they truly come up with a root cause analysis! Thank you for your time reading this review. Please use a different car rental company. Alamo in disneyland is not the one!</review>

<Time>1456861788395</Time><review>There were only two good things about my experience with renting this car from this Alamo location at Downtown Disney Anaheim. .
The staff was friendly and the rate was the least expensive that I could find. The car, a Crysler 200c, was ok but I wouldn't want that same car again.
However, the logistics involved in using that location are ridiculous.
The Alamo office, buried deep in Downtown Disney, is difficult to even find. Inconspicuously placed at the corner of a large bldg complex only accessible on foot. You can't park or even get dropped off anywhere near it. The Alamo sign is placed high near the roof line above the entrance and its orientation is so that you can't see it from either of the directions you can walk in from. So, after being dropped off and walking across a couple of streets and a huge parking lot, I then walked right by it the first time.
After renting the car and receiving the key, I was instructed by the Alamo staff to walk "about 100 yards" to another parking lot where the car was parked. Exactly where in that parking lot they didn't know and couldn't tell me. I was told to simply wander around the parking lot and then push the panic button on the key and see which car lit up.  So I headed out as they instructed, but I traveled a lot farther than 100 yards and finally had to ask the valet attendant at another parking lot where the Alamo lot was. They instructed me to go back another block and a half or so where I found a parking lot with a group of cars on the far side of the lot and I started pushing the panic button, and eventually found the car.  The lot was completely unmarked.  No sign saying Alamo, or anything else. Then when I returned the car  it was the whole process and reverse.  These logistics wasted an incredible amount of my time and energy. Very inconvenient. I will not use this location again and this experience  will make me think twice about  using Alamo car rental again.<//review>< user_id>

I normally do not write negative reviews, but this horrific experience deserves to be told.
I first booked my July rental with Alamo in May. I was told they would pick me up at my hotel to complete the rental. I  called in June to confirm my reservation and courtesy pick up, Alamo confirmed everything was set.

To begin my family vacation, I called Alamo for my courtesy pick up. The representative informed me they do not have courtesy pick ups. I Called up the chain of command till I reached Alamo's corporate office. They offered apologizes with no solutions or emphathy.

Upon WALKING to their location, I rented their mini van. The instructions given to me were my rental car is in the parking lot to the left or 2 stop signs to my right!! All I have to do is wave the fob in the air till my rental beeps!!

I told the representative how ridiculous this was. Upon getting my vehicle 4 hours from the 1st call to Alamo that morning, the vehicle windshield was covered in bird poop. My thought was this was an accurate representation of the service I received from Alamo Car Rental.
Never again.< /Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>tl;dr: Three stars because it was cheap and tree car was fine.

Let me tell you about my SO's and my experience this past Sunday. The guy working there started off fine and friendly. He remained friendly... But so sleazy. Somehow, my boyfriend's last name got brought up which led to this diatribe about how certain religious folks can be obnoxious. Including his father in law who is worth millions but refuses to give (dont remember the name, let's call him Bob) Bob an inheritance due to Bob's refusal to raise his children in a church. Sure ok whatever.

So then he goes on--all while there is now some folks behind us in line to pick up their car-- to talk about he stands up to his father in law because he is an "alpha." ??! So he proceeds to... educate... us on how "about 87% of people are Betas" and that wont stand up to such things. But Bob here was an "Alpha," see? It was so cringey... The only Red Pill nonsense I've encountered had been on that internet and it was so awkward to hear such rants in person. He continues for some reason to talk about how, and I'm afraid I'm quoting here, that " girls will not date... Well they might *date* but they certainly won't marry... Men that aren't useful to them." I don't know how he figured out our hive mind mentality but he caught us! Darn!

Many more minutes passed with SO and I trying to politely speed things along so we could head to Universal for the day. We're almost out the door before we get a mini lecture on how we need to eat a ton of vegetables so we won't get cancer. Because the cure to cancer is apparently found in broccoli. Because apparently there is only one kind of cancer and... I guess i just wasted my degree learning fake science. Whatever.

<text>I had an extremely disappointing experience with this specific Alamo Branch.  I rented a car from Alamo in Monterrey, CA to drive to Anaheim.  I specifically selected Alamo because they provided after hours drop off.  I arrived in Anaheim at approximately 9:00 P.M. and used my GPS to locate the Alamo Rent A Car building.  I kept driving down Disneyland Dr. looking for any signs of the Alamo building.  My GPS kept saying I had arrived but there were no signs of the building.  This was an extremely difficult drive since it was late, I was unfamiliar with the area, and the park was starting to empty creating a ton of pedestrians.  After approximately 45 minutes of driving up and down the road I finally found a Disney employee who had a better idea of where I could find the Alamo building.  (It was not at the address given according to GPS.  I later learned the building uses one generic address that does not correlate to a specific location.)  I drove all around the area the Disney Employee directed me to, but still I saw no sign of the Alamo building.  The location was now filled with pedestrians and this created a very dangerous driving situation.
After 30 more minutes of driving around in circles, I located a security guard on bicycle.  He told me that it is not possible to actually see the Alamo building while driving.  You must in fact park the car and walk around the edge of the AMC theatre to find the Alamo building.  I asked him to explain exactly where I should park and thanked him for his assistance.  I drove to the unmarked parking lot.  (It's actually marked as the Grand Californian Overflow Parking lot.  No mention of Alamo Rent a Car)  I drove to both possible entrances, but sure enough they were both gated and inaccessible.  I drove around for another 20 minutes until I found the bicycle security guard, who shockingly was speaking to another car who also couldn't find the Alamo drop zone.  I told him of the problem with the gates.  This non Alamo employee (No actual Alamo employee was available to assist me.) was extremely helpful and about 15 minutes later got the gate open for me.  I parked in a random spot in this large parking lot.  There were no designated spots for car return.  I got out of the car and followed the security guard who led me to the building and dropped off the keys.
All in all without any exaggeration, it took me at least 2 hours to drop off my car.  While I consider myself a good driver I made many illegal driving turns while searching aimlessly for the building and getting myself stuck on dead-ends.  I was forced to make three point turns in a poorly lit area with tremendous foot traffic leading to a dangerous situation for me and the many families heading home from the park.
The next day I walked to voice my concerns with the Alamo employee.  He basically laughed when I brought up my issues, stating "People complain about the after hours drop off everyday, I've told the manager but he doesn't do anything.  Maybe if you complain he might listen and have something done."
This experience was inexcusable.  A major problem exists, and the business is aware of it, yet refuses to take action, leading to customer frustration, and dangerous conditions for both customers and pedestrians.<//text><date>1439038631699<//date><GmapID>0x80dcd7d88817341b:0x1bfb71dc45933a46</GmapID>< user_id>

<review>The guy that took care of us at the Disney location was a pushy, sneaky, arrogant jerk.  We dropped off the car at San Francisco Airport and they did it right and were fantastic!!  The guy in Disney was so bad that I can only give a 1 star but again the San Fran bunch were great.<//review>< Pics>

We requested a vehicle that would hold 5 people and luggage.  We Got a lovely GMC SUV that was immaculately clean and was perfect for all of us.  It sat 6 very comfortably but we lowered one of the back row seats to be able to get all our luggage.  The two grandchildren, 5 and 8, fought about seating alone in the back row so we had them take turns.  And I had my very own comfy seat without being squished between two car seats in the back seat.

We picked it up at Disneyland which was so convenient; we just walked to the Alamo office in Downtown Disney, were helped by a very nice and funny gentleman and then we just drove it to our hotel.

We delivered the car at the Oakland Airport after visiting Universal,  Santa Rosa and Napa, CA.

The best thing about the whole deal was that it was the best price we got after many calls to different car rentals.  We went thru Costco and saved about 50% from other companies.  We will rent from them again.

Happy Abuelita!</Text>

Walked in to rent a car without a pre-existing booking and was going to book a Corolla but got given a free upgrade to a Chevrolet Camaro which was amazing.
The service was really awesome and friendly and I would definitely come back again when I'm in California.<//Text>

Guy at the front desk was rude and self absorbed, and arrogant. Terrible communication and did not tell us where to give the rental car back. 0/10 would never recommend please go somewhere else to rent a car<//text>

Favorite pupusa spot by far! They are very thick and so stuffed. Just delicious. Their other dishes are also very good along with their quesadillas.  Such huge portions. Love this place. Always busy.< /Text>

The chicken in the salad was really good, you can tell right away they marinate it throughly..I asked the cashier/server what they use as a marinate and I have no idea what she said. I got the chicharrones pupusa and it was very flavorful and rich. Good prices too. Beware: their bathrooms are really old.</review>

<text>Everyone loves this place for a good reason. Their food is delicious. Their pupusas are the best. They have a special on Monday and Friday pupusas for a dollar. Their pupusas are regularly $2.00 and their cheese with loroco pupusas are $2.20. Their prices are super great. Did I mention their portion size? Well it's a huge portion of food. It's a cozy restaurant that you'll enjoy sitting for a comfortable meal. The huevos rancheros plate is amazing. Every single one of their plates is huge so come with an appetite. My favorite is the green beans and eggs plate. The platano Fritos are just perfect. If you like licuados their strawberry licuado is a must. I always get a pupusas because it's the reason why my family found this place.

Their customer service is amazing. The ladies are super attentive. Everything is made on the spot. So don't think you'll get your food as fast as MacDonald's. I recommend this place to everyone.<//text>< Name>

This place is so good. The best pupusas I've ever had. Their empanadas are also really good. I would recommend going on Monday when the pupusas are a dollar. The downside is the wait, but so worth it.<//Text>

Staff was super rude. Bought 20 pupusas and they wanted to give me little sauce and sald that goes with it. They were laughing among each other. I was so upset I was about to record them. But I'm like just give me my food u rude people.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Today in the afternoon I went to order take away food and when I got home the food was incomplete the chicken broth had no meat and the 7 seas broth was very salty and I clarify something that has not always been like that I will always buy food there And today they just leave me with this and I went back and they gave me a little piece of chicken, I just think it's not fair

Cindy & all her employees at A-American self storage are amazing humans. They all make placing your personal belongings in storage as easy as possible. They answer all your questions...so you know when you lock up your unit & drive away for the first time... everything will be safe. And that's all we all want when we place our things in storage is for our things to be safe.< /review>

I spoke to Cynthia the manager when I first moved in and she has been really helpful since day one. If I had questions or concerns she told me don’t be afraid to ask I can’t help you if you don’t call us. She is tough but fair I recommend everyone to American self storage. I still rent a unit.<//text>

These guys are awesome. Mike & AJ are the two main friendly faces i see every time i visit. They follow rules but also go to great lengths to help. They are straight forward and honest. By far the best storage place around and I've had at least 7 different spots in the last 10 years. This place comes out on top.<//text>

{'time': 1525977185445, 'text': 'Hi Bella,\n\nWe are perplexed by your negative review.  The attached photo shows the items you left behind, which are still in the unit you rented.  Your belongings were not given to anyone.  In addition to this we have video recordings that show the staff allowed you to stay on site past our 8PM closing time for a few extra hours to allow you ample time to finish your move.  If you would like your items please feel free to come to the property & pick them up, free of charge.  If you choose not to pick the items up we will consider them abandoned and dispose of them as we see fit.\n\nIf you have any questions please call the corporate office at (310) 914-4022 and ask to speak with a supervisor.\n\nThanks, Management'}<//Resp>

Sweet lady working at the counter. Food was good. Had breakfast sandwich which was filling and tasty. It's a cute rusty old 70s looking supermarket type of cafe. Nothing fancy. But cheap and fast. Across nice walking area by the ocean. Refreshing under California sun. Service was fast and as I mentioned there is a super sweet lady working :) thank you</Review>

While the service was slightly slow, this can be attributed to there being a single person (Joe, the owner, I presume), and the fact that there were four customers awaiting food.  Thankfully, his daughter arrived just as he was finishing cooking my order, and, from that point until I left, things sped up considerably.  My suggesting is to ignore "Adrienne's" review, and go by the rest of the reviews.  The place is fairly small, & the menu is fairly simple - but this is EXACTLY what a neighborhood eatery should be.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Stopped here for breakfast one recent morning while staying nearby.  Tasty, substantial brunch servings, decent coffee, friendly and attractive service!

The menu is more substantial than I expected, with several chalkboards listing all the options.

The place is smallish inside, and also has a couple of tables out front.  It's the sort of independent hole-in-the-wall I seek out when I travel.  Definitely recommended.<//Review><user_id>117572701640634851415</user_id>< Pictures>

I'm not quite sure what clientele this joint services. It doesn't stay open late enough for the hotel crowd (up and down the road). I didn't see many businesses nearby that would stop in (industrial shops). I stopped by on a Monday afternoon and the place was Deadsville.

The burger was okay and the fries were good... but I got a small bit of attitude from the worker (owner?) when I ordered a cup of ice water with my $10 meal. I'm sure he lost some $$ when I ditched the soda, but wow... try to do something healthy for my body, and someone's not happy.

Try it once. Dunno if you'll be back.<//Review>

Walked from the Hyatt, about 10 mins. Opens at 7AM. Chalkboards with interesting specials, with Mediterranean choices. Ended up with the North Beach Omelette with sourdough toast and potatoes. Well done sausage, excellent value, especially compared with the hotel. And an interesting proprietor, who, oddly enough is Joe. Folks come in and order "the usual" - a good sign.</review>

The place is low key, seems to be run by a cool old dude named Joe. He's friendly and his cook seems to know how to make some great sandwiches. The bread they use is great and gives the sandwich a premium feel. I would reccomend this place if you are nearby and into sandwiches and hanging out with some real people.<//text>

<Text>Food is really good and fast. Coffee is good too. My only complaint is that they have cheap silverware. The kind that feels like it was stamped out of a flat piece of metal and then curved ever so slightly. Beyond that, I go here everytime I am in town.< /Text>< Rating>

<Review>Cafe smelled of cooking oil. Interior really dated. The donuts on the counter in the case looked a day old. Coffee tasted watery. I definitely wasted my money and time stopping off at Joe's Cafe.< /Review>< gmapID>

Great location near the airport, great coffee and very nice people work there. They have a cooler with beer and I think some wine and they serve breakfast.< /review>

<Review>I ordered breakfast, 2eggs over easy, one egg was over hard...ok I'll let that slide. Bacon was good, nice and crispy. Now to the hash browns. I noticed they were a little under cooked a little mushy. But the problem was they tasted like Ajax detergent and I couldn't get that taste out of my mouth all day. I dont know if the cook/owner uses Ajax to clean the plates and left some on plate or potatoes taste like that when they are rotten. Bad breakfast.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Worst food ever! I literally paid $13 to only eat the toast. My eggs tasted and smelled like a dairy farm, the potatoes were hard, the mushrooms slimy. The cashier lady was wearing gloves and touching the money, then our plates and silverware, the  reading the newspaper and scratching her head. The SAME gloves she serves our food with! I would have been better off buying chips from the gas station.</text>

< Review>
Fantastic fresh food! The soup was outstanding as well as the breakfasts I have eaten there. Would definitely recommend giving it a shot. We were staying at the Hyatt Recency and walked over to Joes a few times during our week long stay. The food kept us coming back and they have something for everyone, even the vegetarians amongst us. I will definitely remember this place if I am ever up in Burlingame again</Review>

I've been here twice and received excellent customer service. On my second visit, a panel underneath my front bumper got loose and was dangling and scraping the road. Diamond Auto Body was able put it back in for me free of charge since it was super minor work. Super friendly staff, clean facility. I was very comfortable here both times and this will be my first choice auto body shop in the future.<//Text>

<text>Bad communication when I'm there or during phone call. In person they just leave doing their own thing and don't communicate to follow them or anything expecting we know what to do or to follow them or not. Needs better communication with clients and not discourteous attitude. Other than that service was fast and great.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Run don't walk away, not sure the owner knows what's going on in his business.  They build AAA for a new part, used a used part, it went bad and caused over a thousand dollars in damage, had extra work done wish we had used a check to pay for the extra work. I prefer giving praise.< /Text>

<Text>The most pleasant experience pertaining to automobiles that I have ever had. They fixed the damage to my vehicle within a week (vehicle looks new again) and were extremely professional, prompt, and kind. Not that I want to wreck my car again, but if I did, I know I’d be going back here for the repairs.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I would give more stars if I could! Took my car in to have some work done, and they did a great job. Aside from the top quality work, I also appreciate their dedication and honesty to costumer service. Not to mention that Arthur and Peter provided me with regular updates and had my car looking like new. Highly recommend Diamond Auto Body &  Paint!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Hello everyone
I’m taking the time to write this review because this body shop did an awesome job with my BMW.  I’ve never seen so much good detail done to a car.  The bottom line you want to get your car done right take your car to Diamond Auto Body.... 5 star service!

I wanna give a special thanks to Mary,  really showed a lot of professionalism.

Thanks<//review>

My 4 year old son thought it would be a good idea to spray paint my husband's truck black. It was only a couple spots but it still was obvious. I took the truck to diamond and they had it fixed within 20min. Yiu cant tell there was ever black paint on it. Diamond auto body was polite, professional and knowledgeable. We will forever be customers of Diamond auto body and will continue to refer them to evwryone<//Text>

My daughter was driving my car. Got hit by an illegal alien and destroyed my right rear wheel assembly. No insurance of course. Took the car here and they did a pretty good job of fixing the door. However the right rear suspension wasn’t tightened properly. So spent more money to get it done right.<//Text>

I've been to a few places to get random repairs done to my vehicle and these guys did an amazing job and on top of that the price was really reasonable to fix my Subi.Thank you very much!!!
Also I'm pretty sure with as many careless drivers on the road now a days.You can bet I will bring my cars there every time.Thanks again Danny and your team!</Text>< pics>

It is hard to find a company whom you can trust to give excellent service and will not cheat you. We have been fortunate enough to find Diamond Auto Body. My husband and I have gone to Diamond Auto Body for three separate occasions - once for a new windshield, and twice for auto body work. They have gone above and beyond, coordinating with the car rental company and the insurance company. Besides the excellent customer service we received there, the work on our vehicles was impeccable. We will not trust our vehicles to any other auto body company.

I must add - the three cars they have worked on are a 2001 Ford F150, a 2005 Scion XB, and a 2014 Toyota Rav 4 - all of which do not even total $75,000. I was still treated with the same respect as the people with the fancy cars.

I want to end with an observation that speaks to their customer service - the other day I saw an accident not too far away from the business. I saw one of the employees helping a gentleman push his car to the side of the street away from main traffic. I don't know too many companies who would do that, especially in the heat.< /text>

<text>Top drawer operation and they know what they are doing,   Excellent paint job on my little Honda Civic. They went beyond good service - excellent in my book.  Khach is the man to speak with for results.  I will be back for any body or paint work.<//text>< Pics>

Their management and workers are all professional, I watched some of them working on the car and they clearly knew what they were doing. Got the job done early and at a great price for the workmanship</review>

I took my car to Diamond Auto body after my brand new 2017 Audi was rear-ended on the Friant off-ramp of HWY 41.  After getting hit, I had a lot of bad feelings about getting the car repaired because the car was brand new, and I had felt that nobody would be able to fix it correctly. I was totally wrong. The guys at Diamond Auto Body had my car back to factory-looking conditions. After my car was repaired here, my dad had some body issues with his car and he went here. His car came out of the shop looking brand-new like nothing ever happened.
I would recommend these guys to anyone, and I will be bringing my car back here for any issues I have in the future. They get things done right the first time around.< /Review>

Waited 2 months to get my car in this shop to repair a scratch on my back bumper and trunk. Took a week and a half to get it done. Never called me to update on the progress. I finally walked in to find out the status of my car. Told they were still waiting on a part but would be done by 4:30. Here I sit at 4:55 waiting for them to finish "washing my car". And now my bill is $200 more than quoted. I'm really disappointed.< /Text>

people here are not professional.doesnt do it on time ignores most of my calls.trying to avoid disscusion they didnt do as promised.theyll just go in circles just completely waste of my time.beware to those people who want to get their car fixed just plain bogus

My car was not ready when they said.  When they did tell me it was ready I went to pick it up and it wasn't.  When I first went in the receptionist couldn't find my appointment because she was looking at the wrong schedule and was rude to me.< /review>

< review>
Expensive and find it difficult to get into storage when they close the gate by 7pm. Last year when first learning of pandemic, they allowed people to be late one particular month. Then rates went up. One of my family lost work due to Pandemic. I cant work right now. Had to ask for help from family because we fell behind a month.

I hate to see people lose, PERIOD. Whether it be a job, a home, a cell phone... Should be a law that prices can't go up until we have this virus "in hand". Folks should be more understanding. With so many lives lost, there will be plenty of "things" up for grabs without taking advantage of those struggling right now.</review>

<text>Don't let negative review deter you. Never had a problem with the manager and the maintenance guy is always kind and helpful.  It is clean and always kept in top shape. Just like all storage facilities there are rules, and yes they follow them quickly. This isn't a place u can not pay for six months or something.  So if it's close and convenient I would store there Everytime.<//text></record>

When the storage facility is often time competitive it all comes down to customer service and this place has an angry grouchy and cynical manager.

I've had storage at this facility since February 2008! The Manager, Marilyn, is kind, helpful and very professional. Always makes me feel like my stuff was being watched over and cared for as if it was her own! 🙂 And as for price... Very competitive and reasonable! This facility is clean and well maintained!
I would recommend storing your wares at this Mini Storage from among all that are out there in the Yuba City area! In my opinion, with Store 4 Less, Marilyn and her friendly, professional attitude, and the cleanliness of the facility give you MORE for your hard earned dollar!< /text>

<Text>The management is horrible. One evening my code wasn't working and she would not let me out of the gate, I demanded that she did and she said no she had to ask me something  (if I was going to pay my rent) because it was the night before the last day (grace period), to not get a late charge. So then she started getting loud with me .When I advised her that this is against the law and she can't be doing this she slowly went in and let me out. Some ppl,,,SMH!!! I do not recommend this place at all. Think again before you decide to use this place.<//Text></record>

Very unpleasant and unprofessional old lady's working the front desk. Made me feel completely uncomfortable with 100 question as to why i need a short term storage unit. You would have thought she was the one paying for it.</text>

<Text>Zero stars.  My camper was 1of at least 5 that were broken into and everything inside stollen.
The managment team didn't seem to care at all.  They were sure to ask if I had insurance because they " Weren't responsible for loss or theft"  NICE.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809b5359cc3f9f07:0xef2f472653229ae6<//gmap_id></record>

Food is generally very good, but I find it obnoxious that their tip menu goes from 20% up. It’s already one of the more expensive spots in Noe to begin with. Also, avoid their soup, my housemates and I found it awful.<//text>

If you interested in Greece culture you probably know about his traditions of food. Not to be confused with an Italian. We chose Lamb 'Gyro' and Moussaka for takeaway. Lamb was the sweetest, totally fresh, and fantastic juicy. Classic Greek Moussaka was tasty and creamy.

This place is a good spot for all who like something new and non-classic. I definitely come back later.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1592938576601, 'text': "Thanks Hao! We're thrilled to hear that you loved the food at NOVY. We'll see you next time!\n-Kathryn Gianaras\nOwner"}<//resp>< user_name>

Wonderful restaurant in Noe Valley! I’ve only been for brunch but it’s always busy when I walk by. The food is very delicious, the staff is friendly and I highly recommend it. There’s an outside patio if you prefer that and people sometimes have their dogs sitting under the table with them.<//Review>

Arrived and was waiting for 2 friends.  Pretty much ignored.  The 2 on duty staff were cleaning up tables, resetting and checking in with other tables that were eating or finishing meals.  Really doing anything else except checking in to see if I wanted a drink or order.

It wasn't even busy.  Not sure what the issue was, another local customer mention they had had similar experiences.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I got a heavenly lamb dish (thinly sliced lamb, caramelized onions, garlic cloves, dice tomatoes, greens and [of course] a well made tzatziki sauce) all of which was somehow made to fit- æsthetically nonetheless- in a pita wrap, giving the thing a look closely resembling a regulation sized NFL football- but only in appearance- flavor-wise it was so good I wouldn't judge a lamb for ordering one on the DL.🐑🌯
It was my 1st experience @ NOVY but far from my last one! Keep up the great culinary masterpieces!😋👌< /Review>

<text>My wife and I arrived at 12:15 at Novy Restaurant.  We ordered a salad and a chicken wrap that we were going to share and ice tea.  The ice tea and salad came promptly.  From then on we were ignored.  After 20 minutes I flagged a person down and mentioned that we were still waiting on our wrap.  We watched everyone around us getting served.  25 minutes later still no wrap.  We canceled the order, the check appeared.  NO one ever apologized for our one hour total of waiting.   We were invisible.  We live in the neighborhood and have seen the quality of the food and service rapidly decline.</text>< Pics>

<text>My wife and I visited May 2019. On our last night we elected to try NOVY.  Both being pasta lovers we viewed the menu prior to arriving and had our selections already picked.   There was a slight wait when we arrived, but were greeted warmly by the staff and able to grab a drink while we waited.  (it was a little chilly out but there are nicely placed tables for outside seating) Once seated our server was very helpful when I asked for a recommendation between the special and the Lamp bolognese. I was persuaded and I'm glad!  Overall it was a great memory of our visit to San Francisco and would encourage anyone in the area to try.<//text><Rating>5</Rating>< name>

Very good salad and main dish. The quality of the ingredients was evident. I tasted a rare and exceptional dessert of Sabaglione with berries that was excellent. The coffee was good but it was just filter coffee. Adequate, and polite service. The lunch menu didn't have many meat choices that weren't lamb, and also not many vegan or vegetarian. Good setting.< /text>

Brunch: good variety of delicious dishes including breakfast type, burgers and salads. Fast, courteous service. Serving sizes just right: generous but not so big we felt stuffed or couldn't finish. We ordered dessert from the regular dessert menu which was wonderful, but some diners were having chocolate chip pancake with whipped cream & strawberries which also looked amazing.</Text>

Lamb souvlaki was overdone and dried out, but everything else was wonderful. The crispy polenta appetizer was creative and delicious. I will return and specify medium-rare lamb next time.</Review>

<Text>Good lunch menu, flavorful Greek food.
The lamb was very good.
Portions we're good size too.
Also, outdoor seating is a plus</Text><Date>1537823090383< /Date>< Rating>

Lovely little upscale restaurant. I recommend getting something other than the burger, just because they have so many unique dishes. the polenta appetizer was delicious. Our server forgot our drinks but bought our second round to show she cared. Very kind of her!!!!< /Review>

I used to eat here all the time back in the day when NOVY was Panos. NOVY is run by the children of the folks who operated Panos, and they've done a great job of making the menu contemporary and fresh. I love the chicken wrap and the penne with ragu. Friendly staff and breezy atmosphere make this place one of my go-to's for lunch (I work on 24th 'street). I hope they're around as long as Panos was!</review>

Service was incredibly slow for ok food. Took forever to get a simple glass of water, and when we did, they just brought a bottle, no glasses. We ended up just using our empty beer glasses to drink from.

Would have been understandable if the establishment was busy, but it wasn't.</text>

NOVY RESTAURANT on 24th St.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bianca was my waitress and Carlos the chef. DELICIOUS. Salmon was grilled to perfection.
Our salad, fresh, crispy & plenty for 2 to split. Moussaka generous portion, took 1/2 home. 😋
The speciality drinks were really great but too small!  😉
Service was timed very well. I feel rushed if it all comes out too fast. Bianca timed it perfect. She didn't fire the main courses until our salad course was completed.
We had time to rest, talk & enjoy our meals. We never felt rushed. (Some restaurants look to turn over tables, more $$, but I loved it there. Lived in Noe Valley almost 33 years, definitely one of my favorites!😋</text>

<Text>A new and authentic Noe Valley experience. The food is a creative fare of Mediterranean and California cuisine, with delicious options for brunch, lunch, and dinner along with well-considered beverage pairings. The ambiance is amazing. Our new favorite perfect start to a weekend morning is brunch at Novy.<//Text><user_id>101951218447805427776</user_id>< Rate>

Food was terrible, some over cooked, some under cooked. Quality was not worth the money. Service was not good. Initially they forgot about us and after we ordered they brought someone else’s food.</Text>

My wife and I shared the French Toast, Shrimp and Grits and the Huevos Rancheros for brunch. All 3 plates were amazing! The Shrimp and Grits is a must try and the homemade sauce on it is to die for. The Bloody Mary was spicy how I like them and the service was great. I want to come back and try this place for dinner after having such a great experience for brunch!<//text>

We were served here by loris and the service was appalling! We were shoved outside with 2 tables pushed together and we were made to feel like an incovineince from start to finish! When the bill came we wanted to split it between 6 cards which had always been fine every place that we have eaten in during our 3 week stay in California. We were told that there is a 2 card maximum and that we would have to draw out money or pay on only 2 cards otherwise they would phone the police!

Wouldn't recommend this place at all so unfriendly and the staff have an awful attitude!<//Text>

While waiting for a table at Griddle across the street, my friends and I decided to go to NoVY instead and sit outside, I'm so glad we did! The food was really good and unique. They serve rustic mixed breakfast potatoes, such a nice change from the classic diced potatoes. The service was a little shoty but can be overlooked due to the quality of food.< /text>

This was the best burger in SF.  Sadly, they altered ingredients.  It looks the same but ISN'T.   Tried 3 x.....all bad now.</review>

The haloumi and tapenade was delicious - especially the tapenade. The panos lamb burger is very good. The gyro could have been packed a little more evenly. The lunch and dinner menus are different. Service is friendly.< /Review>

<review>Having visited America in larger groups numerous times and this being our last night in SF we expected to enjoy a lovely meal before leaving for England. From the very beginning we were treated badly. We were put on tables outside which should have been absolutely fine as they offered us the outdoor heaters but even this was too complex for them. The manager Lauris was very standoffish, neglected us and had a bad attitude when asked politely for condiments etc. He upsold orders to a cringeworthy degree. The main problem was the 2 card maximum payment policy. We were on the last night of a 3 week trip across 3 states as a group of 7 and hadn't come across this policy and service this poor for such average food. I asked what the other option was and he replied that the police would have to be called. The food was reminiscent of the salad bar at Whole Foods but probably without the Organic sourcing to match. I would stress to anyone in a group to avoid this restaurant and to anyone with a palette to not bother. If we had had good or even average service all would have been forgiven. Anyway Francisco the other waiter was lovely, I only wish we've been served by him.<//review><Rating>1< /Rating><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

<text>If you want to grab a good bite after experiencing the San Francisco culture, Noe Valley's NOVY gives you the best BBQ burger to the surprisingly big souvlaki wrap. Super chill environment and they have any great beer and wine that quenches your thirst! And they're all local brews and wines. Love the start up story love the place, definitely come and grab somethin here!<//text>< resp>

I recommend the pasta with shrimp. We also ordered the polenta with mushrooms which was good and we had to return the asparagus because they tasted burnt. However the servers helped us immediately. They speak Spanish # I speak

Recomiendo la pasta con camarones. También pedimos la polenta con champiñones que estaba buena y tuvimos que regresar los espárragos porque sabían a quemado. Sin embargo los meseros nos ayudaron de inmediato. Hablan español #hablo<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Great restaurant. Ice cold, delicious drinks. Just the thing if you want a late lunch or early dinner table. The food was great. Both the salad and the chicken wrap were impressive. The waitress was also very courteous and told us insider tips for San Francisco. Highly recommended.

(Original)
Tolles Restaurant. Eiskalte, leckere Getränke. Genau das richtige, wenn man einen späten Mittagstisch oder frühen Dinner-Tisch möchte. Das Essen war super. Sowohl der Salat als auch der Chicken Wrap konnten sich sehen lassen. Die Bedienung war auch sehr zuvorkommend und erzählte uns Geheimtipps für San Francisco. Sehr empfehlenswert.< /text>

Didnt get served, Maybe because I'm Brow . Stood at the and watched the bartender serve everyone look at me then just walk away. I had money in my hand. All I wanted was to play pinball and have a Jameson.
Got a bad vibe from all the males in the place.
I guess wearing your best hoodie, or tank top and flip flops isn't a place for me....</Text>

Nice bar, cold beer, friendly locals. Crabby bartender doesn't quite knock it down to 4 stars. I guess that he is probably a good representation of the old timer locals up there, a part of the overall aesthetic of Garberville.< /Text>

Wed night. Preatty quite but everyone is generally friendly. They do not tolerate any riff-raf or druggies. Great place for good old American tourists to meet locals. Trimigrants not so much unless you come correct.</review>

<Text>I've taken my dog there earlier this year when I found that she had gotten very nervous and anxious about getting her nails done. They were so nice with her! She needed some extra tender love and care and they gave just that.

I brought her in for a bath and de-shedding recently as well and my pup seemed so happy after! 1. Happy to see me and 2. She had this sassy strut while walking after. She definitely felt good! Haha
They sent her home with a pink handkerchief which was also super cute.

They're amazing! I'll be coming back. I trust them with my pup. I recommend taking your dog here.< /Text>< time>

<rate>4</rate><text>They bathed clipped my little dog and she looked great. They are a bit pricey however they do a wonderful job and you're so gentle with the dogs. I watch them room one and they allowed the owner to help them by being next to the dog so the dog was not traumatized. I think that's important. Animals are like children  only in fur coats.

Staff was friendly, services were well priced and they seemed to have their regular clients, but this was my first time and when I got a call to pick up my dogs, I arrived an hour after the call and I still had to wait for one of my dogs to get her fur trimmed because they forgot to finish her grooming services.
But that's easy to overlook if you have time to spare, the reason this is a 1 star review is because both my dogs came home with eye infections. They have thick yellow discharge and they can't keep their eyes open without constantly blinking and rubbing their eyes.

They went in two healthy dogs and came out  infected, which will ultimately cost me more money to take them both to the vet and get antibiotics than what I spent to groom them. They must not have good sanitation practices and will not be taking my fur babies there again.</text>

< Review>
My dog seems to enjoy going there and he always looks good when he's done. The facility is extremely clean and well-equipped.  I tried another place one time and they cut my pooch's nails too short so that he was limping. Been going to American Pet grooming for almost five years and have never had that problem, or any problem at all. Staff is very kind and courteous. They are busy, however, so expect your pet to be gone 4 to 5 hours on a Sat.</Review>

Jose and his crew are true pet lovers. We had to leave out 2 small dogs with them for 5 days. They were well taken care of and showed none of the stress they showed after stays at other places. In fact, our Shih Tzu got the hot oil treatment for her skin problems and has been happier and more playful than we have seen in a long time.
Thank you Jose and crew for taking great care of our family members.< /review>

<Text>José and Maria are the nicest people and the  Took very good care of my dog. I had her in for grooming for the first time and usually she barks the whole time and she shakes when she comes out of the groomers. When I went to pick her up she was actually smiling no shaking no barking! You can tell they really care for animals.  José also shared that they have a person coming in a couple times a week to clean teeth at a much lesser price then I was going to pay. They were an answer to my prayers ! Thank you Maria and José<//Text>< time>

This was the worst grooming my dog as ever had . The haircut was uneven  and too short. My Shih tzu dog had really long hair, almost touched the floor, I wanted to keep it that way but the lady said that she had knots in several areas and that it would be better to cut it short. By "short " I now know that she meat almost bald. There are blood stains around almost every nail which means she was bleeding when they were cutting them because they were cutting them too short . The service wasn't  that great and the grooming overprized for the poor job that they did. Never again.</Text>

What can 🥫 say about Rosa Maria's that hasn't been said? Love this place (places), comfort food since my high school days, got a Garbage Burrito and a Chili Rellano Burrito, one for now and one for later, still the same good (great) food, highly recommend this restaurant.<//Review>

All Mexican restaurants are different because we come from different regions, so we got it together.

They have the BEST BURRITO'S and RELLENOS on EARTH ~ bar none!!
I just wish they'd open a place up here on the High Desert cuz it's a long drive down the hill for take-out.  Then we could indulge weekly instead of monthly!☆!  Aahhh ~ that would be heaven!♡!<//review>

<text>Had a large order last night for 7 people. 4 of the 7 had stomach issues and diarrhea all night. 2 of the 7 people we have not been able to reach yet to see how they are. There was no other food served so we are thinking it was from here. I'm very surprised. We've been eating Rosa Maria's food for 40 years with no problems. We are wondering if anyone else had issues on Thursday October 15th at the Highland location.<//text>< pics>

The best burritos in so. Cal. Their garbage burrito is out of this world
Also their breakfast burrito will get your day off to a good start. It's  kind of difficult to see from the road, but there is always a line. The best for us is to call, put in our order, then just go pick it up. Their bean, cheese and meat burrito freezes well. We always buy some to freeze and some to eat.< /review>

Ordered Chile Verde burrito with beans and cheese but the meat was plain, no verde sauce? O'well! Priced fare but I would pay extra to get what I want.

It was good. Wish the staff didn't look so bored,  greeted me and told me bye when I left but no they didn't say hi or bye, I know I shouldn't expect this all the time but it feels nice, you know? Anyway the food is real good, the mild salsa for chips is bomb and spicy, but the regular hot sauce for food is even better. Also the restroom is so clean. Good burritos and enchiladas. I like it a lot.< /Review>

The food is top shelf as always but I saw no visible access for a wheelchair which I use most of the time. I did manage to get inside after considerable pain climbing a curb and a couple of steps. To someone who walks, no problem. To someone who CAN'T, BIG problem.< /Review>

This is another "must stop" Mexican food establishment when we are in Southern California. We have enjoyed their meat and cheese burrito's for over 30 years, as well as their cheese quesadilla's. They are truly world famous and have great food and prices. Glad they have expanded from their small, but busy, place on 40th street over the years.< /text>

I’m still thinking about the burrito that I ate yesterday. It was a being rice and cheese but it was perfect. Everything about it was amazing the portions of beans to cheese to rice couldn’t have been better I eat Rosa Maria’s all the time and it’s great but they were on fire yesterday.< /text>

If you like to take it up a notch, add a couple of their hot sauce containers which are right there on the counter ready for the taking. It's not too hot for me, just perfect. Service is exceptionally friendly & fast, place is nice & clean. The only problem is I live in NorCal & this gem is in SolCal. I guess I'll have to visit my parents more often 😋< /Review>< userid>

<Review>I get food here every Sunday and I haven't found anything that compares.  Remember those huge burritos back in the day filled with meat?  Get an XL and relive it, wow!

The Chile Relleno burrito is heaven on earth, and even their bean and cheese burritos are delicious!  They also have jr, regular, and XL burritos, which makes it perfect no matter how hungry you are.  Great Mexican food!  And on your birthday, they give you a free burrito and drink - how cool is that?!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Best burrito place in highland. Honestly this location is the best rosa Maria's location as well. Somehow everything always tasted better, and the XL burritos are a bit bigger too!<//review>

I always get a burrito here. Probably been eating Rosa Marias for 20 years. Today however the burrito was like its been sitting out for a couple hrs. The tortilla was hard, and some of the rice was dry and hard. Not overly warm either. I hope this isn't the norm for dinner time. I usually go at lunch.< /Review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>I had to take my 5 star down to a 1 star today. Wow $9 for a small bowl of menudo. And on top of that they charge you for extra lemon and tortilla? Every Mexican food place in the surrounding area don't charge for any of that and the portions are nearly double the size. I will not be coming here for menudo ever! Very disappointing!

Update: so I found a place with a worse off price for menudo. I will say rosa marias has some of the best tacos around. The burritos are also great. I'm not sold on their menudo but to each is their own. With that being said I bring their review up to a 3 star.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Aug 2019.
So I'm not from around here and I was looking for authentic mexican food.  We where near and this place had great reviews.  We went and had our food. Its definitely not authentic. The food was edible and the prices were a bit high for the flavor. It's not taco bell but not mexican. Its somewhere in between. Heading more towards taco bell taste.
Edited. Aug 2020
Forgot to mention that you will not see carne asada in the menu. Also the hot sauce has the consistency of a tapatío bottle sauce. Very limited menu.<//Review>

9/12/2020 I called and was put on hold for 5 min, I finally hung up and drove ther, the place was empty, when I mentioned  my lengthy wait I got no response, nada. These women are rude af.
My burrito was cold. It was only a matter of minutes between when I ordered my food and I ate it, the cheese wasn't even melted and the tortilla wasn't soft like the old days, it was thin and dry. Won't be coming back 😐.</review>

I've been all around California (and the rest the U.S.); this is still the best menudo I can find.

First thing -- most important -- Rosa Maria's restaurant only serves their menudo on the weekend; this is one of the main ways to tell if a business prepares their menudo fresh or simply reheats a frozen stock.

The tripe used is the reticulum section, or "honeycomb", the best type of meat for the stew -- no grease, no gristle. They boil away the fat, ensuring the meat and stock aren't oily and clouded, add the most tender hominy and give it the time it requires to properly stew.

By the time it makes its way to you, this menudo's been properly seasoned and the additional spices and trimmings the staff provide simply make an already amazing dish even more mouthwatering. To top it all off, they'll even add a meaty, tender pork bone, the perfect way to finish off such a satisfying meal.

This place is excellent. Sometimes, the beans have little rocks, but that's just another sign of freshness.

Keep it up, Rosa Maria's! I'll see you next Saturday!< /text>

Its priced way too high for a BRC burrito that is no larger than DelTaco and half of it is tortilla.  Beans not mashed hardly at all and the rice to bean ratio was off.  Too much rice makes it very dry and it sucked frankly.<//text>

<user_name>Gloria Vergara< /user_name><Text>(Translated by Google) The workers are attentive ... but the food is disgusting ... according to they serve fresh food and it is superheated ... so much that the meat is falling apart ... I say x that I know about gastronomy ... I do not like it, no I recommend it and will not go back.

<review>(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went to eat some tacos the person who served me was so awful horrible but since I did not equal and they taught me education I said "thank you very kind" you know he did turn around and turn his back on the rude look at his staff because another person will not react like me or they throw the tacos in the face to the next look at your staff.

(Original)
Ayer fui a comer unos tacos la persona que me sirvió fue tan pésimo horrible pero como yo no me igualó y me enseñaron educación le dije "muchas gracias muy amable" sabes que hizo darse la vuelta y darme la espalda el mal educado vean a su personal porque otra persona no va reaccionar como yo o le tiran los tacos en la cara ala próxima mira tu personal.<//review>< Pics>
