<Name>Jacqueline Leija</Name><Text>I love Pacific Home Decor!!! Don’t waste your time at Home Depot or anywhere else. Rachel design my kitchen within a couple of minutes literally. She added everything I wanted and provided useful advice and ideas. I ended up ordering my Kitchen cabinets, counter tops and sink plus all kitchen knobs for the same price Home Depot quoted me just Cabinets nothing fancy basic white cabinets. I will be back for my kitchen floor as well as dining and living room.<//Text><date>1601073028751</date>< userid>

Bought a bathroom vanity from Jennifer. She told us it would come in within 7 to 8 business days. 12 days later, i called for pick. Jennifer said she haddent received it. Few days later, gota call from Jennifer saying the manufacture send the wrong color. No choice but to get the wrong color as we had deadline to meet. Had to fight tooth and nail to get discount on the wrong color. Not easy to understand. Last purchase.<//text>

<Review>This was my first remodel experience and it was wonderful thanks to Pacific Home Decor. The salespeople was communicative, honest, and extremely friendly. When we wanted something, they would bring you to the section and explain the benefits and negatives of each item. I am obsessed with their super friendly customer service, they were seriously amazing. I can’t recommend PHD more enough, our bathroom is now perfect, I was super satisfied with the material we bought from them. It totally fit our taste and the style of my home.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

I can ensure you that when you walk out the store, you will definitely learn a thing or two from the salespeople. The price was very reasonable too and they would give you an estimate whenever there is a change. All in all, I am highly impressed with their service and are hoping to use them again when we home remodel need.<//review><resp>None</resp></record>

<text>Enormous warehouse with a huge selection and by far the best customer service.

I was greeted at the door by Erica. She was sweet enough to give me a tour around the store.

After I told her what I was looking for and what part of the house I wanted to work on. She provided a lot of advice on what I should do and what other customers had done in the past, which is super helpful. Also, she was never pushy, unlike salespeople from some store, Erica was very patient will me. I appreciated her honesty and eager for the customer. Excellent service and beautiful store!<//text>< response>

<Text>If you need knowledgeable and customer-oriented people to help you in planning and design your next kitchen, this is the store for you, definitely check them out.

Erica created the kitchen that we wanted to have, she listened attentively to our expectation and requirement while giving us good feedback on our initial idea.

We only had a few visits and meeting with Erica, and she already remember what direction we are heading toward along with our taste. She made sure that we are updated all the time.

You want the top service and that is what you are going to have in pacific home decor.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f912284398d9d:0x6a5097318bcb04dd<//gmap_id></record>

<text>I have been working with Pacific Home Decor for a while now. I have always appreciated their profession and their attention to detail. Addition, they always have and remained an excellent service for customers. We are now working on my bathroom right now, although it has yet to be completed, I am confident that it will be done professionally. I am excited to see the end result of the bath room.<//text>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I know that finding a good cabinetry for our kitchen is not easy but very fortunately I found this place. They are the best store I have been so far. The store is huge and had a variety of selections, and customer service is top notch. We remodeled our kitchen with their help, we started with nothing and now we had our kitchen design. I bought all the cabinets we need and they also referred a contractor for us, and that saved us a lot of time on finding a contractor. Now, I just have to wait for the contractor to finish our kitchen, I cannot wait to see our beautiful kitchen.<//text>< Resp>

Recently I had my kitchen remodeled, and this company is exactly a perfect team to work with! They had a really friendly and kind customer service, and I think I couldn’t find any other teams better than them! The staffs helped us design our kitchen, they always answer your questions pretty well and give you a good suggestion based on your own opinions as treating you more than a customer. So sweet! And their cabinets and vanities are in high quality and modern design. I highly recommend PHD as your kitchen remodeling partner! You can never go wrong with this perfect team!<//Review>

Excellent high-quality cabinets and customer service. I couldn't say more about their service... Kenny spent hours and hours with me planning out my design even when it is the lunchtime period. he was very responsive to all my emails during my kitchen design and planning.

<Review>I could not be happier with our choice to go with this company, and the A+ team! I don't think you can go wrong with this company, look for Jennifer and Rachel. Their custom cabinets are really contemporary and modern.  They are not the cheapest quote you are going to receive, but the quality and durability of the cabinets is well worth the cost. I strongly recommend them!</Review>< pics>

I'm in need of a bathroom vanity and so I went to the store that my friend always talk about. In surprise, they have many styles and sizes of vanity. I like how the countertop is mix and match, meaning I can pick my own countertop and match it with the cabinet that I want.<//Review>

Pacific Home Decor is the best remodeling store I have ever shopped with. Go there and talk to Hao. Not only because they have a variety of tiles, floors, cabinet and vanity, but also they have most of them in stock (even if not, the lead time is very reasonable). We purchased the whole kitchen cabinet, counter top, and some other stuffs, and it turned out to be FANTASTIC-- absolutely loved those! If you are into contemporary, modern design, PHD is the best among the whole bay area-- both quality and pricing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED with my first Google Review.</Text>

<Text>Pacific Home Decor is one of the best in the area without any doubt. I had gone to a dozen places such as Home Depot, Ikea, and NGY before coming to PHD. I would say this store had totally blown me away by their stunning customer service and materials quality. I would give them a hundred stars if this was ever an option. Anyway, I came to PHD, hoping to remodel my stupid looking kitchen. I was helped by their manager, at first I thought he is a little too young and lack of experience to assist me. But, as we started to talk a little bit more, he completely changed how I view him. He is able to answer all my questions in a way that I would understand too, and he also gave me some great tips on how to design my kitchen. Additionally, he is able to show me the exact 3D model of what my future kitchen is going to look like and an estimate of everything. I was able to enjoy my time while remodeling my kitchen with him. I had a great time working with him, and I would definitely recommend this store to anyone that is hoping to remodel their lovely home. I can guarantee you that this store would not let you down.</Text>< Resp>

Really love this place, they carry some very high-quality cabinet and elegant mosaic tiles at a very reasonable price. Definitely better than Lowe’s and Home Depot and will be back for my next future house.</text>

PHD and a Kenny Zheng are great to work with. The selection and quality were just what I was looking for. With their help, we were able to transform our new kitchen into an updated classic kitchen which we will enjoy for years to come. I highly recommend PHD and Kenny for future cabinetry needs.< /Text>

I had a very hard time finding the right place to purchase my cabinets for my kitchen and I just happened to be in Hayward checking out different supplier. I decided to check this place out since I got nothing better to do so I told myself “why not”. I am glad that I did not skip this store.</text>

The cabinets were supposed to be white shaker but they are half white and with all the possible issues. Horrible customer service.</Text>

<Date>1617305828811<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I am glad I came to this shop, being a proud owner of 1996 Toyota LandCruiser on a budget, when something goes wrong, I fear the worst, i know it is not an easy truck to work with,  when I brought it here, they did the inspection and talked to me about the possibilities, they advised me to do some preliminary work on it and see if the issue went away,  they were so knowledgeable that they  did advise me on the major things that i can prepare for and not tried to do it right away, their judgement was so great, My truck feels totally rejuvenated and for now it drives great with the initial recommendation. I will definitely comeback when the time comes for another service, they were so courtesy, they give me a ride home and pick me up when the truck was completed.  Thank you very much!<//review>< pics>

They were so thorough and detailed w pictures to go with the diagnostic for my car. So I could visually see what had been found. For a small shop like this one I was really impressed I mean nobody else has ever gone that extra mile not even the dealership. A++ on that alone.</Text>

Staff and technicians were knowledgeable and thorough in analyzing my auto’s condition and capably fixing the problems.  The information and photos of the auto provided to me were very detailed.

Included in the work was replacement of the front brake pads and rotors; the brakes no longer squeak.  Previously when discussing squeaky front brakes with the dealer, the rep said that this tends to be the normal condition!

You will pay for the services received, not a discount operation.  The work quality at Tokyo Automotive Repair is superior to the dealer and if you value the life of your Japanese car, this is the place to take it.<//Review>

<Review>I have used several car repair shops, but I am fortunate to know that Tokyo Automotive car repair shop that I found this time is a great car repair shop where all car experts are gathered. Tokyo Automotive shop found out exactly the old problems of my car and repaired it professionally using the OEM parts. I was so satisfied and decided to repair my car here in the future. Once again, I think it's only luck to me to know Tokyo Automotive repair shop.< /Review>< date>

I realize that many who DIY will jump to hasty conclusions, in this case it was perceived that spark plugs were over-torqued. But it ended up being that they were just too tight due to hot/cold cycles over years of the car being turned off and on, and how unlike metals will fuse.\n\nI understand that you are a college student and that you are on a budget. If any of those items on your to-do list you find are out of a DIY person's expertise, I will work with you on that. Thank you for entrusting your Mazda 3 to us."}</response><Date>1600366536776<//Date><text>They take care of the customers here and go the extra mile to answer any questions and concerns you have. I mistakenly thought a technician might have over tightened some stuff on my car, but they were willing to explain and show me the care they put into their work, even the simple things. Turns out they were right from the start, and did all the work with the proper steps (including torque specs if you care about that).

Their inspection system is great, with pictures and details that you would want. They don't force repairs upon you and only recommend what they honestly think you need.

Go here rather than the express automotive shops that don't put care into their customer's cars. You will rest easy knowing that Tokyo Automotive will take care of you.< /text>< Rating>

I took my car here because it was making loud noises that resulted in damaged sparkplugs and they asked me two hundred for the spark plugs and they said they were going to discount it from the total in repair and they didn't cause I ended up paying almost 500 for the exchange.

I reached out over the weekend in need of rather quick services. Reaching out during closed hours you would expect a business to ignore calls if they were in the shop. Not here I was able to speak with them and get set with a solid estimate that they stuck very close to even after getting into the vehicle. Communication was amazing with them, they provided a loaner vehicle that allowed me to not fall short getting to work and they have an amazing way of communicating problems found during diagnostics. Communication can be difficult from a shop to a customer who isn’t familiar with auto maintenance but theses guys use a system that can help anyone understand those “extra” tag along. Without any question spend the money and get it done right here.</Review>

I must admit I went in a bit apprehensive despite the great reviews others had previously experienced. What ultimately drew me to this auto shop was the consistency of the reviews saying how thorough, transparent and honest the owner was. After having an overall assessment done on my IS350. They electronically sent me an evaluation and recommendations WITH pictures to validate. No other shops that I've been to are this transparent....5 stars right there! If after reviewing their suggestions, the process to accept or decline each recommendation was super easy and very efficient. My car was ready before the time they quoted me and my car went in better looking than when I dropped it off thanks to the complimentary car wash.

Of course there\'s the master technicians, some of which I plucked from dealer, but there\'s also the minimum wage guys, and then everyone in between. But for some reason some people believe that just because it says Subaru, Toyota, Lexus, Honda, pick your brand in front of the building, that somehow they are better than the independents. If price is your only or of high priority, then they have the B or C tech that will work on your car. They also have 2 different SKU numbers for parts made in America, Canada, or Japan... but they also have SKU numbers for those that are made elsewhere; again so they can appeal to the more frugal customer.\n\nAnd of course if you call the dealer with "Tokyo Auto is charging me $XXX, how much would you charge me to..." then of course they are going to give you the cheaper price.

The team at Tokyo Automotive are very Proffesional while still giving you a family owned feeling.  It was my first time there and I got the sense that what was being installed in my car was top quality.  I liked that they took pictures of all the items being replaced.  They are a bit more expensive that other shops they are up front about it and I appreciated that.  They take pride in the service they give. I would give them a thumbs up.< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1596209772197, 'text': "Jorge, thanks so much for bringing your Subaru Forester and thank you for giving me an opportunity to talk about price. We do employ ASE certified master technicians, have complimentary rental/loaner cars, and back most of our work with a 3 year 36K nationwide warranty, so we consider ourselves priced similar to dealer. Where you would save money with us is with sheer honesty. We do not believe in high pressure sales tactics, nor do we sell you things that you don't need. If we are selling based on preventative/longevity reasons we are up-front about it. We also have access to high quality aftermarket parts (often the same people who provide OE).\n\nAwesome that you mentioned family owned feeling. Dad started the shop in 1978 and mom works with us as bookkeeper. Also thanks for mentioning our digital inspection. And thanks for the great review!"}</resp></record>

Took my car here (04 wrx) hoping for the best and my expectations were blown away. These guys are awesome (detailed tech notes with pictures and video updates showing the issues that need to be addressed, web based sign in and updates, complimentary wash, they even cleaned the engine bay), not just professional but really cool guys as well.  I highly recommend this shop.</text>

Tokyo Automotive repair was so generous in offering St. Jude Hospital employees a free oil change service during Covid-19 as a thank you to caregivers.  I took my car in for the service and not only did they change my oil, they did an overall check up of my car and and gave me a detailed report of what was good and what needed some attention. My car was ready when I got there, they even gave me a ride to work and the owner is very personable, honest and informative.  Very professional repair shop, I highly recommend them.<//Text>

Jordon, Thank You, for bringing your Nissan Rogue to us."}</resp><Text>I was blown away at how advanced and transparent this service was. Far beyond any mechanic I’ve ever gone to. You know how, if you’re like me and don’t know much about cars, you go to take your car in to a mechanic and then whatever they tell you you just have to take their word for it even if it doesn’t feel all the way right? The system they have at Tokyo gives you real time updates on the work being done on your car with detailed notes that you can understand and you can access anytime through an online link they send you. I’ve seriously never seen anything like it before. But by time Tatsu called me to give me a rundown of everything, I was pretty much already on the same page as them. They are all super friendly and helpful, they priced the work fairly and affordable for the level of detail I got, and made sure I felt good about the transaction. I’ve had some real crummy experiences in the past, which is I will not be bringing my cars anywhere but Tokyo in the future. I highly recommend this automotive repair.<//Text><user>110645935878303224090</user><time>1591830486651</time>< username>

Love these guys!
The hybrid battery in my 10+ year old died suddenly. Dealer suggested I look into other options since the they would charge >$5K.  My wife remembered Tokyo Automotive Repair since she has driven by it many time.  I called them and they immediately knew what to do, gave me an estimate and arranged a loaner vehicle for me.  Best part is, they replaced the battery (not easy to do) at a cost less than half the dealers estimate, then delivered the washed and vacuumed car on time. The owner and Rakesh are great guys who know what is going on, were very clear what they would and needed to do, accurately estimated the cost  and never once tried to up-sell me into other stuff.  What a pleasure it was to support a local business. They will be getting all my business from now!</Text>

<Review>I highly recommend Tokyo Automotive as a trustworthy, competent and efficient shop.
I went in for the first time for an oil change and upon checking my mileage was told, I could go 1,000 more miles before the recommended oil change was required. What shop tells you the truth and once they have you in aren’t ready to add to what you need?
Based on my schedule, I opted for the earlier (mileage) oil change and got the full inspection/check (Tokyo Special). They provided me with a detailed report of the status of each part they inspected- which I found valuable.
I chose to wait for my car, which was not a problem as they have a comfortable waiting spot with a long table and chairs.
If you are looking for a shop to build a honest relationship with for your car and wallet, I would recommend Tokyo Automotive for you.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd69a7c5c7a5d:0x90aa98ba02c29ab3</Gmap_id><user_name>Nargess A</user_name>< pictures>

<text>First time to this shop. Purchased a new to me used Tundra and needed a alignment as well as a general inspection of the major areas of the Vehicle. Called Tatsu who was very warm and friendly and he was able to get my truck into the shop the following afternoon. Arrived at the shop dropped my vehicle off and was given a ride home (didn't have to uber). Few hours later the shop called and my truck was ready for pick up. Fair pricing and honest work. What was most impressive was the  detailed inspection report with the photographs. Really a great way to share with customers the condition of their vehicle. I will be back and highly recommend.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_UNOEig6hvClq2VvPHbia1_o2g2havQcoPiaO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Gmap_id>0x80dcd69a7c5c7a5d:0x90aa98ba02c29ab3<//Gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1576553836922, 'text': 'Wow!

<text>We've been going toTokyo Auto since 1996. They are super professional, super kind and always happy to see me. Most places seem to take advantage of women. Not Tokyo Auto! I've mostly been in charge of taking in the cars for the family. Their prices and professionalism have been the same when they deal with me and when they help my husband. They've won us as clients for life!!<//text>< Resp>

<name>Suren Shah<//name><Review>I have been a customer of this facility for the last 30 years when AKI was the only main tech.  Excellent and prompt service by him.  My this experience is OK due to fact that they have some new tech. I had to replace the Alternator for my Acura RDX so I had my car towed to this place.  I wish they had included diagnosis price of $80 when it was known that I needed alternator replaced (I told them before since tow truck mech told me so). Their price for replacing the part is in the ballpark, so no issue with that. The only concern with the new tech is that he did not even tighten the cable on the new battery (which I had just 2 months ago), thus the car did not start after the work. I noticed and I told him so, once the cable was tighten , the car started and last two days I have no problem.

overall, I like this family and will continue to bring my cars for service.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1596136060816, 'text': "Suren, I apologize for the loose cable. He was not a new tech, he should've known better. But people make mistakes & he's apologized.\n\nAs for the diagnosis, I've had many times when the tow truck driver was wrong. What the tow truck driver says is often speculation or gut feeling based on the fact it's output is less than 14.3 volts. What our diagnostic does beyond what tow truck driver says is actually looks at computer systems and see if they are commanding the system voltage. Many times especially on a sophisticated system, such as on your RDX, the voltage regulator is external of your alternator. If we just went blindly off what tow truck driver said, it's possible that we might've replaced a perfectly good alternator.\n\nAs for the monies for the diagnosis, we no longer live in a society where milk is 10 cents, especially in Southern California where median house prices are 650K. There are other shops that still No Charge the diagnosis out there, but they don't employ ASE certified technicians, give you a loaner car, nor do they likely have a 3 year 36K warranty.\n\nYes we might be a little more than some places, but my hope is that we are worth it. Sorry if the above sounds like a rant, but I wanted to explain to the viewing audience what the difference is.\n\nLastly I wanted to thank you Mr. Shah for coming in with your Acura and Toyota Camry."}</resp>< gmapID>

<Review>This is my yelp review, just reposted on google:

After thinking about what happened for a very long time, i decided to go forward with writing my review. I stumbled across this repair shop on google, and through the sheer amount of reviews i thought the place seemed trust worthy.

I had a slow oil leak in my car. After explaining the problem, i scheduled an appointment and got a fluid diagnosis and vehicle inspection at the cost of $160. Very steep price. They didnt take anything apart, and they didnt do anything special to find the leak (fluid indicators like i was promised on the phone.) I wanted a professional opinion, and wanted to get it professionally fixed cause money is tight nowadays.

They have a nice system that basically allows real time responses and results, which you can easily add or deny services. Once my diagnosis got done, i was slapped with a recommendation for timing chain service for 2 grand. I was extremely worried cause of my very little experience with this kind of problem, so i took my car out of their and went to my gf’s brother for inspection. Basically, he power washed all the oil off (tokyo auto service didnt even bother washing it off) and i drove the car to see where the oil was leaking. I check again after a couple days of driving and wallah, my oil plug at the bottom is the ONLY place with oil leaking. It explains why it leaks slow, and why it always drains really slow. I was appalled, angry and disheartened that this mechanic shop with such great reviews can be so deceptive, greedy and manipulative.

The only response to the recommended service was “ohhh your car eventually will need it changed, and its better to do it now then later.” the red flag was that they wanted to change my water pump, etc but none of that needed to be replaced. I literally came in for that small leak, only to realize the true nature of their business and how they handle things. If you are looking for a recommendation on where to get your car fix, i would be extremely careful here, especially if you are on a budget. I love the story of your business, but what you did to me was not right.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1596211683275, 'text': "Justin, I apologize that we got it wrong, but I am looking at the pictures we took from your visit and I see no oil around the drain plug that you mentioned. But if I still got it wrong I welcome a conversation.\n\nThe $160 you mention, as I mentioned in another response previously, we no longer live in a society where milk is 10 cents, and in Orange County where median home price is 650K it's difficult for a shop that employs ASE certified technicians, has complimentary rental/loaner cars, & a 3 year 36K nationwide warranty to give away the inspection as a no charge. And certainly I cannot compete with a g.f. brother hook-up.\n\nAs for the timing chain, I believe my guys when they say the timing cover was leaking. But why go in there to do the timing cover and not do the timing chain or the water pump. I mean, we're already in there. By doing those items ahead of time, it would save you money on the back end. I suppose we could've done the timing cover only. That is an option. Apologize that wasn't discussed.\n\nHowever I do apologize again if we got it wrong. Maybe my guy was having an off day. And I again welcome a conversation."}< /Resp>< UserId.>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Up front and give you the info straight.  You can probably find a little cheaper but not with the warranty on work they provide.  They even give you a lift home.  This was my first time there and I would go back.  I did the Tokyo Special and even though I was hesitant at first due to the price, it ended up being worth it. They noticed some issues the dealer didnt notice.  No pressure to do any work.  They explained what needed to be done sooner than later, what could wait and what should be watched.  Definitely a shop to look at for your auto maintenance.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have been going to the Tsuchida family for years and trust that they will take care of me and my car. They offer fair and honest prices. They guarantee their work and are always striving to ensure they answer any questions or concerns I may have. Highly recommend!!!

I will not take my car to anyone else. I trust the team at Tokyo Automotive to always give the highest quality service on the maintenance of my vehicles.  They are always accommodating and friendly. They make sure that they put their customers first. It is always a pleasure to see the family and crew at Tokyo Auto. You can sure that you'll be in good hands when you go there.

An honest, skilled mechanic is hard to find.  I came in and was instantly put at ease by the teams manner and communication.  They also found a hidden intake manifold crack, which let me take it to the dealer because it was just under warranty.  I’m looking forward to using Tokyo automotive in the future!  And next time I have to buy a used car I’m going to have them do an inspection first!

Update: I’ve been going to Tokyo Automotive for a year now, and I have been constantly satisfied with their professionalism, attention to detail and customer service.  They keep doing a great job.</text>

< Review>
I'm on the road a lot and I know my car needs to be in tip top shape in order to get me to places without delays. I took my car in for a normal oil change thinking I'm going to be in and out fast. But they actually take the time to look through and see if anything else is wrong with the car that I should be aware of. Tatsu took the time to go over each item with me, and for someone who doesn't know much cars like me he put it in layman's terms.

I'm glad I took my car in to the shop and would recommend people to go here for an honest job done right.<//Review>

I went in for some maintenance and also a full inspection. Tatsu was very helpful with the repairs he recommended me and went through in detail why he recommended specific repairs. I decided to go through with certain repairs and I was also supplied with a loaner by Tokyo Automotive. In my experience with going to other automotive repair shops with my parents, I have never seen a shop supply it’s own loaners so I was very thankful that I was granted that privilege. Going into the shop there was also always someone there to greet me and help me with whatever I needed. I will be going to Tokyo Automotive from now on for all my car maintenance and repair needs!</text>

This shop does excellent work, is family owned, has reasonable prices and is trustworthy! I once brought my car in for repairs, but the problem that needed fixed was covered under an extended warranty. Instead of repairing it and charging me, they sent my car by flatbed tow truck to a Honda dealer so  it could be fixed for free. I love places with integrity!< /Review>

Tatsu and his team does phenomenal work. I have full confidence in the worksmanship from Tokyo automotive. Pricing is not the most competitive (that's why i had to deduct a star) but you can rest assure that your car is in good hands.

Charged me $100 to test my vehicle with a tool I could have borrowed from an Auto parts store for free, and then didn’t check anything else, what did I even pay for? I feel ripped off, told me my head gasket was blown and quoted me almost $5000, that’s insane!< /text>
<response>{'time': 1578353839292, 'text': 'I\'m sorry that you feel that way about our service. We do employ ASE certified Master technicians, so we cannot simply give away the diagnosis time. I get it., there are other shops out there that are significantly cheaper. Not all of them have a 3 year 36K warranty. Not all of them employ ASE certified technicians. Not all of them offer a loaner while your car is being worked on. We are likely 1.2 to 1.5 times more expensive than those shops for that reason.\n\nWe actually charged you $95 for what we originally quoted you $190 for. Once we knew that it was the head gasket we didn\'t see any point of going any further, and charged for the 1/2 hour that it took us. Regarding your comment about the "Auto parts" tool, yes it is a radiator pressure tester. I\'m sure that a you tube video could\'ve taught you what sort of pressures constitute exhaust blowing into the coolant. That\'s actually the best way on a car that is running somewhat well to diagnose. A compression test would\'ve likely not been able to accurately diagnose.\n\n$5000 is a bit of an over-exageration. $4370. That\'s without cutting any corners. That also includes a timing chain kit, all the drive belts, thermostat, head bolt set, a freshly machined head, etc. The simple fact is the car is 1986 Toyota Pickup RV conversion, and any car pre-2000 we cannot take the chance to skimp on anything.\n\nI hope you find some resolution to your problem.'}< /response><Rating>1< /Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

It is hard to find a reliable auto repair shop that not only does the regular maintenance but also looks at how the car is running to address possible future problems. The fact that I would drive my 1979 280ZX car across country and not worry about any car problems says a lot about Tatsu and the expert people working with him.</Review>

I love this shop! Tatsu and his family are very nice people and they have amazing mechanics.
They have worked on both my Honda Fit and most recently, my daughters Kia Soul. I  am very relieved to know that I am protecting my investment by taking my cars here.<//text>

{'time': 1579975259471, 'text': "Hello Sandra. I understand that you're angry at the situation & looking for someone to blame. And if I were in your situation, I might do the same & seek blame on the oil change place that you went to prior. All I'm saying is it's likely not the fault of the oil change place, rather the fault of you or the previous owner for not doing enough oil services. It's more likely that this is compounded by years of neglect & lack of frequent oil services.\n\nFor the record the engine is making a horrible sound from what seems like the top of the motor. Our former Hyundai/Kia master technician has seen many of these motors go bad because the back camshaft ends up starving for oil. Now it may be possible the previous oil change place didn't change the oil & just said they did. The oil was somewhat dark & low. You wanted to know about the oil filter being too small. Yes it was, but that wouldn't necessarily cause the problem. It's just an indication that the oil change place might be using inferior parts or lacks care to put the correct filter on ...but I wouldn't hang my hat on that."}<//Resp>

Tatsu & team always take care of my Mazda CX-5. I've only been coming here for over a year but their attention to detail and willingness to communicate with us regarding any/all issues is to be admired and appreciated. I especially want to thank Aki for allowing me to come pick up my car a few minutes after closing time. We all have busy lives and it's always tough to run these types of errands, but I really appreciated him making an exception for me this one occurrence because I was having a pretty difficult day, otherwise. He also recommended that I address a gasket leak with the dealer since it's technically still under warranty. Other places would probably try to milk this service for themselves, so I appreciated the tip.

Thank you again, Aki, Tatsu, and team!<//Review>< Pics>

I respect this mechanic shop by far more than other shops I've been to in the past. It's difficult finding a shop that is honest and gives you the upmost respect from the beginning.
I brought my TSX in for an oil leak and they were able to diagnose and repair it on one day. For the time being they gave a loaner car so that I wouldn't have to rely on other transportation.
Pricing is reasonable and they will not bring up unnecessary repairs.
Very glad I went here for my repair. Will be back in the future.</review>

< Review>
Enjoyed very much conversations with Tatsu re: possible causes of oil leak and repairs needed.  Appreciate his honesty about what could possibly also be a part of the leak and possible additional repairs.  Good clear estimate and pricing so no surprises.  Noted in diagnosing problem and options they didn't make mistake of previous shop and diagnosis, which would have cost me $400 to fix a motor mount that wasn't broken and couldn't have even been leaking same motor oil in the first place, since it wasn't a liquid-filled motor mount.

Previous repairs on same car done very well with no follow-up problems.
Appreciate their being close to my neighborhood and easy to leave for a day for more time-consuming repairs.

Added bonus to learn my Camry could go another 150,000 miles, which makes saving for a new one unnecessary.  Thanks for great service, Tatsu and guys.<//Review>

<Review>My 2006 Toyota Sienna minivan has been to Tokyo Automotive 3 times in the past few months (twice for repairs and once for a warranty issue) and each time Tatsu and his team took EXCELLENT care of my vehicle. Rest assured when your car is in the capable hands of Tokyo Automotive. They are professional, curteous, helpful, responsive, and experts in both simple and complex automotive problems. Thank you once again for the exceptional service!

Update: We had yet another positive experience at Tokyo Automotive and I can't imagine taking my van anywhere else. Before Tokyo Automotive, I was considering getting rid of my vehicle but Tatsu and his team have given it new life and I am looking forward to driving it another 140K miles!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I recently went to Tokyo Automotive to have my starter replaced for my car. This place offers superb customer service and they will even take you home while they work on your car. They will also pick you up when your car is ready.  The price of repairs may be on the higher end, but the good thing is you are given a 3 year warranty. This was not the case at the last shop I went to to have my starter replaced. I paid 285, but the warranty was for only 6 months and the starter wore out in less than 2 years! Useless. I’m very happy with the service I received at Tokyo Automotive and definitely recommend it to anyone who owns a Japanese car.</Review>

<pics>None</pics><Text>I will continue taking my Nissan Altima to Tatsu and the staff at Tokyo Automotive. They have proven to me several times that they have my car’s best interests at heart. Tatsu takes care that his shop is transparent and respectful with recommendations and diagnosis. They do not corner you into unneeded services or repairs but will work with you to get your vehicle into the condition you need for a price that won’t break your bank. That may require some brutal honesty from Tatsu as he lays out the situation for you, but he also does his best to allow you workable options to get you back on the road and is ready to pick up the phone if you have any questions. It was a tough blow as a college student when Tatsu told me I would have to replace my engine, but when I brought it in he was able to work the balance sheet to relieve some stress and rolled it out to me with a number I was comfortable with. I’m thankful for finding Tokyo Automotive and recommend them to any Japanese car owner in OC. Thank you Tokyo Auto!!!< /Text>< name>

That sounds like a "hole in the wall" garage or a backyard mechanic, give them a six pack of beer alternator. Which is fine if your buddies do that kind of work.\n\nWe are professional, ASE certified, factory trained mechanics. And we offer a 3 year 36K warranty on the work we do. For that reason, we also do not put inexpensive parts on your car.\nAs for the core charge, I know of no shops that will sell you the alternator without a core.'}<//Resp>

<text>Talked with Tatsu and Jasper and got my Sentra repaired for an exhaust issue and other issues, as I was neglecting my poor vehicle for long enough.  They do provide drop off and pick up service which was very nice and prices for repair were fair.  When I first walked in I was greeted by Jasper and he took the time to go over a repair plan and seemed very patient. When I came to pick up my car it felt and looked like a brand new car again!!!! I would recommend this shop to anybody.  Thank you again Tokyo Auto Repair! I will be coming regularly to maintain my vehicles.<//text>< Pics>

Things to know before you go:
-Under new management, a majority of these positive reviews are from when Aki was in charge of the business, his son Tatsu now runs the place
-Their labor rate is higher than Weir Canyon Honda's
-They charge a premium on top of MSRP for parts, I mean that very most expensive number you can find for a part, they charge extensively on top of that 50%+ more because "they have a right to make a profit on the parts"....even though there's profit already built into the MSRP because you're buying it at below MSRP....
-Their Diagnosis fee DOES NOT roll into your work, Unlike the dealers. If they say 3 hours of Labor, you're paying for at least 4 because of their diagnosis fee, dealers don't do that. Dealers Hourly rates are cheaper too

Here's the background,
My very first 5 star Yelp review was for Tokyo Automotive many, many, years ago. Since then many things have changed. Aki is no longer in charge of the business, his son Tatsu is and boy oh boy have things changed. I recently took my Honda Civic in to have the Airmix Motor replaced they quoted me upwards of $700, having trusted them before and knowing they were amazing before I assumed I was getting a great price on parts and labor. I even asked if the diagnosis time/fee rolled into the repair total, he said YES! Then charged me an additional hour afterwards. Then after paying I started to do more research about it, I even went as far as to take his part number he replaced to 2 dealerships and asked them to quote me on the part and labor to change it out, without either dealership knowing I had already paid for it. Both dealerships quoted me $280/$300.... Having a good relationship with Tokyo Automotive in the past, I called Tatsu and in a nice way explained to him that I thought he over charged me, I got slammed down with "We have to pay our employees living wages, we don't have people working for $12 an hour" and "Well you get a 3 year warranty with us, you won't get that anywhere else" (3 year warranty when I paid over double up front.... let that sink in) I really was trying to let Tatsu do the right thing but he just wouldn't and that's too bad. Myself, my brother, my grandmother, two aunts, my dad, church friends have all used and loved Tokyo Motors in the past, we've always been impressed by them, but as long as Tatsu's at the helm none of us will be back. I hope he finds his way again and doesn't lose everything his dad built and worked so hard for.

Moral of the story, Tatsu doesn't want want to give you the best service for the best price anymore like his father always strived to do, making a deal on a handshake. His father knew that a repeat loyal customer, who brags about you to all their friends and family so when your friends/family have an issue with their car you speak up and say, "Hey I Know a great guy!" and he gets the business is better way in life. That's the Tokyo Automotive Aki built. Tatsu wants to try to sell you on a great fancy experience of some sort. I thought the dealership is where you pay for an experience, loaner cars, popcorn, soda etc. I've never cared for those kinds of places personally. All I knew was Aki was the man for the job, and I trusted him, what he would do for our cars and our family. To each their own, I wish Tatsu the best of luck, his way of running the business is just not a business I would want to do business with.< /review>

Our family has valued your business for a long time and we take your feedback to heart, which is why we have been thinking for a while now on how to respond.  Yes, our family business is growing and evolving.  Yes, we were known for being an affordable shop for many years.\n\nWhat you may not know is how the cost of running a sustainable business is going up.  If we want to continue serving our friends and neighbors in Placentia, we need to keep up with the times.  This means additional training since automotive technology is becoming more and more complex, additional digital equipment to properly repair the complex technology inside these vehicles, and the rising cost of hiring highly-qualified technicians.  Gone are the days when a business can sustainably do things on the cheap and call it high quality.  Our family business continues to offer excellent quality, personal care, lots of amenities, a strong warranty, and a stress-free customer service experience.\n\nIf you are only choosing us because we used to offer the lowest price, we agree that we are not the best shop for you.

I brought a Subaru in for a pre purchase inspection and ended up in an interesting chat about business philosophy with Katsu, the owner of this family business. In short, while I did not have any work done, I would definitely bring my car in. Katsu has a mature sense of self and of business, says he is not the cheapest by any means but always strives to do outstanding work with only the best quality parts, and offers a 3 year warranty of his work to back it up. So obviously he is not for everybody, but if you do care about knowledgable mechanics and a high level of repair quality and realize you will pay for it, I recommend you give them a try and see if they are a fit for you. I believe they specialize in Japanese makes only.<//review>

Tatsu was not only friendly, but very informative. After speaking with him, I felt very comfortable leaving my car overnight. They offered me a loaner so that I would still be able to get to work, which was a plus for me.

He kept me in the loop, while my car was being worked on. I had an oil change and inspection (because I neglected my car for a bit). And when they ran into a problem, Tatsu called before doing anything (Not all shops do this, trust me).

Given my financial situation, I couldn’t get to fix everything I wanted but with Tatsu’s help I was able to fix the major issues while staying within my budget. He emailed me a list of things we couldn’t get to, along with suggestions for the next time.

My car is running great, and the noises that it used to make are no longer there. The saying ‘you get what you pay for’ really applies at Tokyo automotive.

I will be back for my next oil change and to check some things off of the suggestion list.

Thanks again, Tatsu, you guys are great!<//Review>< GmapID>

The kind words I thank you for, but are inconsistent with a 3 star review. Hopefully my responding to this will prompt google to give you an opportunity to re-edit.\n\nJust in case it doesn\'t, Rodney was prompted Google to review a few companies all at once. Probably overwhelmed, he accidentally hit 3 stars for a business that was listed above; you know that one where Google says "You\'ve recently visited X places..."\n\nAgain Rodney thanks for the kind words.'}< /response>

<text>I recently purchased a 2018 Toyota Corolla to replace my beloved 2004 Toyota Camry LE V6, which was declared a Total Loss after an accident 2 weeks ago. The replacement 2018 Toyota Corolla was purchased from Miller Toyota in Anaheim and has about 33,000 miles on it. I took it the Tokyo Automotive Repair to have an Inspection to confirm that the vehicle is in good shape. They gave ti a clean bill of health. So, now I am confidently pursuing the remaining tasks that come w a car purchase: inform my Auto Insurance Company, finalize the Auto Loan, et. al. In 3 to 6 months, I will check in at Tokyo Auto for oil change and possible other Preventive Maintenance they recommend<//text><Pics>None</Pics><rating>4< /rating></record>

Grateful to have a trustworthy mechanic who does a great job.  We trust them with our new Honda Pilot, Honda Civic and Scion xD.  And they kept my old Nissan Altima running far beyond the point others gave up on it.  We always recommend them.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Tokyo Automotive is unbelievable in what they can do.  This recent trip was our Dodge Van which just refused to start.  They specialize in Japanese cars but we don't trust anybody else with our cars even the Dodge dealership.
We also had two  1979 Datsun 280zx.  One is a cream puff with under 43,000 miles. The other one was a wreck at 350,000 miles.  Parts are really hard to get as it is a unique year. Tokyo Automotive manages to either find the part or create one. Wonderful master mechanics.

They are great folks, Even their dog is great.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Had a slow leak in my tire and stopped by Tokyo Automotive to get it patched. Was greeted by Tatsu and he took care of it. Happy to hear it’s a long time family business that specializes in Japanese cars (Lexus, Toyota, etc). Impressed that he purchased a used Toyota Prius for own personal vehicle with over 100k Miles for him to learn how to fix them. Excellent customer service and very knowledgeable about cars. Will come back and highly recommended. Arigato Tatsu!</review>< pictures>

I've been bringing cars to Aki and Tatsu since 2004. As their shop has grown, their volume has also increased. I must say, part of me misses the small shop it was when I first came in; however, Tatsu has done a great job of never compromising customer service. Last time he offered a rental car for me as he needed to keep my car overnight and I needed to find a way to get to work. Five stars all around! I will continue to bring my 2002 Lexus back for service and maintenance for as long as she lets me...and you know...those cars never die!</text>

That's not fair!? ...and you're giving me a review based on us fixing a mess up another mechanic did. Again not fair. Only he knows what components he changed out.\n\nAll that we noticed at first, is that the crank pulley had snapped and that the belt had frayed. Changed out those components and noticed that the previous tech (from another garage) had put on the wrong A/C compressor which we think was the root cause. At that point we advised your wife to go to the other mechanic and demand that they put another A/C compressor with the correct amount of belt ribs.\n\nBut your complaint was about price. A crank pulley and a multi-rib/drive belt, those two items aren't cheap, and it took about 1.5 hours to install. We also charged 1 hour to figure out the problem via our diagnostic charges. By your wife's own words the guy who worked on it prior to us was a friend working out of his back yard. If you're comparing me to that of course I'm going to seem expensive. Imagine how much cheaper it would have been had we worked on if first and installed the correct A/C compressor and not have caused the belt to fray nor the crank pulley to snap at the rubber insulator."}</resp>< Rate>

Our opinion was the previous mechanic put on the wrong air compressor, caused the rubber cushion on the crank pulley to snap and walk forward. Explained that to you and left it to the shade-tree mechanic who we felt owed you something. If we did something wrong I welcome you to call us. My door is always open for discussion.\n\nWith Kind Regards,\nTatsu Tsuchida"}< /resp><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>None< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dcd69a7c5c7a5d:0x90aa98ba02c29ab3< /gmap_id>< pictures>

This store sucks! The only reason it's still in business is because its next to the sports bar and it stays open later than all stores in the area.
I hate coming to this store they OVER CHARGE for everything. Lots of prices just come out of the air!<//Text>

FINALLY!!!  Shelby (the owner) did an amazing job!  The color is perfect and my grays are gone.  I showed her 1 pic of the cut I wanted and she nailed it 100%.  The prices are great and Shelby is such a cool chic, what more could you ask for?  I def recommend this salon and I will be back!<//text>

<Review>Was the absolute best experience I have ever had going into a salon to get my hair cut and colored. Learning some of the background of the Kole Michael salon made my visit feel much more personal. Shelby truly cares about her work, customers and community; on top of that she is a phenomenal hairdresser, colorist and stylist. This salon does not use any harsh dyes or chemicals which means there won't be an overwhelming smell for the duration of your visit; a surprising plus in my book. I thought I should also mention how nice the lighting was, no obnoxious blinding florescent lights that show every single imperfection. Treat yourself!</Review><gmap_id>0x80db27dac9f6c605:0x61a9875a16291775</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

MIL SPOUSES NEW TO THE AREA LOOKING FOR A HAIRDRESSER, PLEASE READ THIS. PLEASE. I've gone to Kole Michael for over a year. At first, I was impressed with them. I was pretty nervous about finding a hair salon since leaving my hairdresser of 5 years due to a military move, but the prices were good and I was generally satisfied when I left. However, the last few visits (most notably the last visit) were awful. I sat for over an hour each time with foils in my hair (NOT good for your hair). I continued going because I was afraid to go anywhere else. My last visit was the final straw. This time, I clocked it. I sat in a chair with foils in my hair for over an hour and a half while the hairdressers talked/gossiped. When I left, I thought "whatever, my hair looks fine". Here we are now, and I've lost so much hair I've started taking photos of it every time I brush it (photos to follow). I've tried everything - argan oil, Moroccan oil, coconut shampoo...you name it, I've tried it. Nothing works or even helps. 10+ pumps of a detangler doesn't even help this destroyed disaster. I had thick, long hair. Now it's notably thinner so much so that it scares me because I don't know when my hair is going to stop breaking/coming out (not only is my hair falling out, but I have hairs that are severely damaged and stick up on top of my head and I literally can't do anything about it unless I want to pull out more hair). And for those who may think it may be caused by something else, it most certainly is not. You CANNOT leave foils with blonde highlights in someone's hair for an hour and a half. My hairdresser back home used to use a timer to make sure this would never happen. I'm so upset but afraid to reach out to anyone at the salon (thus the anonymous name) because of how I hear the hairdressers gossip. PLEASE heed my warning if you're coming here to have your hair colored. Haircut - fine. Hair color - AVOID PLEASE. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. It's horrifying and so upsetting. (P.S. The photos are all of different days/times)</review>

<Text>Jennifer Tackett is very talented! We brought her pics of what we wanted and she walks us through the process of what is realistic for our hair types and makes very tasteful recommendations that we have come to consistently trust.

Not exaggerating, she gave us some of the best and COOLEST haircuts we’ve ever had.

Thanks Jennifer!

<review>I paid for my girlfriend to get her hair done. She came home with orange and grey hair when she wanted sand color done bayaloge style . The next day She washed it and had a chunk of grey hair come out because she fried it!!! She called to have it fixed and the owner wants to charge her $45.00 more for her mess yup!!  Now we have to go somewhere else to have it fixed!!!Bad customer service...she should not have her licence!! I would never recommend this shop to my worst enemy.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0sBU3KnUKlPZFOCZMeurmlX9VV6legfr_VPFr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpZnteywYe1wmjZFCwNvqAhQCDUobJLI5zi0DM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

If Shelby is totally booked because I waited too long, I make an appointment with Jen if she is available.  Love the quality of service and the pampering I receive there!< /Review>< response>

My daughter  went down to get her hair dyed and done on 8-26-17. To her surprise  they did Not take credit or Debt card. Cash or Check ONLY. Also the girl had a personality  of a dead fish. Funny part is, there was another lady getting here hair done, and surprise.  She had to pull Money out of her bank too. NO one told my daughter  or the other customer about the Cash or Check ONLY policy.  We will never go back.<//text>

<Review>I love Shelby!!! She's amazing I've never trusted anyone with my hair and I went into kole micheals and was scared to get my hair cut, not only did Shelby make me feel very comfortable but I told her exactly what I wanted and she visualized it and rocked it. Shelby is my permanent hair stylist now I'll never go any where else!!!!</Review><gmap_id>0x80db27dac9f6c605:0x61a9875a16291775< /gmap_id><Date>1429837142329<//Date>< Pics>

It was really smokey when camping  but still beautiful.    It was also VERY busy and a little "trashy" people wise.  Blaring music,  loud talking/yelling  i know thats most campgrounds but this one was way worse.   Beautiful though!<//text>

<time>1547322877536< /time><review>Super nice hike. The hike is around 7 miles. Be careful, the lake is deceiving so at the start the hike looks a little shorter than it actually is. If you get here early you can park right outside the entrance for free (in a real parking spot, not on the side of the road).

Even on early January its not too cold to hike. We saw no snow at any point but do bring a jacket and maybe gloves. Awesome lake and great hike.

Also, there is a bridge for every section. You shouldn't have to cross the streams or rivers at any spot (at least we didn't have to).< /review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

What a beautiful. And beautiful emerald water.  Nice to visit in the spring or fall. In the summer it's very hot large campsites. Many hiking trail and awesome boating.</text>

Wonderful campground. Very clean, multiple areas to access the lake and several great hikes. Local store right outside camp for small needs. We felt as though we had plenty of room in our site for our family. We camped in the Sierra area. The mosquitos were out and about so fair warning bring your repellent!

The lake has several places to rent boats and places to fish. We took the waterfall hike with our family and it was perfect for elementary age kids. We drove down to the trail head in another days use area to make it more manageable. Looking forward to our next trip!< /Text>

Beautiful, clean, fun and great access to the park. Tent campers beware: lots of RV camping which adds generator noise and obstructs views.<//Text>

<Text>Call and call and call, yet you will not be able to get ahold of anybody nor will you get a response. Even if you find a campground available fairly "last minute", you cannot reserve a spot within 2 days of your desired camp time, which is absurd.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Loved it, had a large group, not too packed when we went in late March. Water was obviously too cold at that point but we had a great time playing with the kids, walking along the trails and taking in the sights and sounds of nature. Can't wait to go again!<//review><gmap_id>0x809a472529d522cb:0xa1911ae0d2e20a3b< /gmap_id>< user_id>

Beautiful park. We spent a night here and really liked it. The lake and nature are very peaceful. We went on a Wednesday and there was almost no one in the area. Only downside: They don't have showers. Jump in the lake!</text>

Worst campground I have seen. It was on a steep slope with no place to pitch a tent. The price was also higher than other campgrounds in the area. The lake was nice though. I just don't think I would camp here again.</text>

It's a city slickers campground,  camp sites too close to each other and EID says they patrol to keep people quiet at night but at between 8 -10 pm people are blasting the music.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Stay away from here like the Plague!!! Worst experience ever!!! Their customer service person tried to blame me for not communicating what I clearly told the technician needed to be done then she rudely hung up the phone after I complained and said I wasn't happy about the service. The first and last time I will ever take a pet there. I made a mistake bringing my beloved cat to this place and hopefully you won't make the same mistake. They gave me the wrong medication and charged me for medication I didn't even get. When I made them aware the girl I spoke to on the phone brushed it off like it's something they do all the time and told me not to worry the other medication does the same thing, but the tech guy who handed my kitty back to me said no such thing!!! Then they had the office manager call me and that got me nowhere, poor guy, must be like the deaf leading the blind over there cause after I explained everything he did nothing to resolve the issues and now I have to spend more money and take my cat to a real vet that actually administers medication and does what is asked of them, a reputable place that gives the correct medication and explains clearly what you are being charged for and then resolves client issues with by making the customer happy. A simple solution would have been to offer me a refill at no charge but they wanted to up charge me for an injection, meaning another visit. Absolutely unacceptable, so they have lost my business for good and I would not recommend them to anyone.<//review><Name>Billy Slick<//Name>< user>

<Review>Nicole was very knowledgeable, kind, and thorough. I felt comfortable talking to her right away!! Her customer service is on point. 👌🏽 I haven’t met the veterinarian yet (it’s covid times) but I am sure he is great too (my dog got her needs met). They also have Spanish speaking workers. This clinic is now my primary choice of care for my puppy.<//Review>< pics>

Best doggy and kitty doctors ever.  I have been taking my pets here for seven years.  They treat my pets like their own. Very caring and they will spend as much time as you need to answer all your questions and concerns.  The staff also do wellness calls to make sure your pet is feeling better.  It is all about your animals health and wellness.  I will never go anywhere else.</text>

They got my puppy in quickly and the vet got me in right away. They asked questions and took interest in my puppy's health. Vet was more interested in getting Honey Boo Boo better than making me spend a lot of money on unnecessary tests and treatment. He actually listened to what I thought was going on based on her history. I think we found our new vet! Will definitely come back and recommend.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

We were going to Chatoak Vets but VCA bought them & they only cared about $$
Winnetka Animal Clinic is such a wonderful change, they genuinely care about animals, the Dr's take time & explain things.
The staff has been wonderful too< /Review>

This is the best vet in the valley! They actually care about your dog and not their profits. This is the only vet I will use for my Bulldogs. Just had my puppy checked and the vet took extra care with him and additional time with us. The best!< /Review>

Friendly staff. The vet had his own dog hanging out in the office which my pup certainly appreciated.

Though this clinic takes both dogs and cats it's worth noting that both times I've gone there are way more dogs than cats so if your cat is not socialized with dogs bringing them here may cause them more anxiety than is necessary.</review>

< Review>
First and foremost Thank you to all the Doctors and staff of Winnetka Animal Clinic for their attention, knowledge, care and love they gave my Bull Terrier companion Sindy.

I first brought Sindy in for a urinary tract infection. She was peeing blood!! Panicked, hysterical, and teary-eyed I called the office to set an appointment with Dr. Lee, who was very soft and gentle with handling Sindy. I helped out with keeping Sindy calm and cool during examination. I appreciate the Docs very direct approach. He'll tell you straight and gives you recommendations on the spot that will better you animals health. I suggest you take pen and paper and prepare to receptive to critiques.

Several months later I took Sindy to the Doc to check out skin tags that developed on her belly. After waiting for biopsy results, at age 11, Sindy has small cancerous tumors on her belly and legs that blister and burst with blood... I thought it was the end of Sindy & Hemie's adventures.

After a recommend surgery to remove the tumors Sindy has thrived another 10 months and counting. Dr. Lee did the procedure himself. He removed as many tumors as he possibly could. He even showed the the tumors afterward. Pretty wicked 🤩

Winnetka Animal Clinic has very fair prices. Don't let fear of high prices drive you away from providing medical care for your animal companion. Call them!!< /Review>

The front desk staff & nurses are very friendly and helpful. Which says a lot because I have been to quite a few animal hospitals and I had never encountered such a happy and friendly staff. You can tell they love what they do. Dr. Lee is very patient and kind, he did my dogs tumor removal surgery and dental at a much more affordable price than I was quoted at another animal hospital in the area and their quote didn’t even include a dental cleaning. So happy I found this animal clinic!</Review>

The staff and Dr. Smollin are the best.  The waiting room is spotless and welcoming.  I truly appreciate the care and compassion that the entire staff has with regards to you and your pets.  They are respectful of your time and you are usually seen within a few minutes of your arrival.  I am so grateful that I found this clinic.  Eventhough it is considerably further away than my old veterinarian's office, it is so worth the extra time, I only wish I had found them sooner.  There aren't enough words to express my admiration for Dr. Smollin, simply put, he's fantastic.</Text>

Our first visit to Winnetka Animal Clinic was great - the facilities were clean, the staff were friendly, and Dr Smollin was very calm and patient. We were so pleased thinking we had found our new veterinary home. The next time we brought our pet in, was when the Covid-19 restrictions began and the Clinic adopted the ‘curbside’ method. We were so appreciative of this effort and thought it would go smoothly. Our pet was not able to see Dr Smollin this visit, and the Dr we did see seemed exhausted and quite frankly looked ill. While he was very kind, he and the staff overlooked our pet’s entire file and did a new patient exam, coming out after to tell us all of the findings that we already knew about and that they had already treated and/or given advice on. We reiterated for a third time, the first being over the phone when making the appointment and the second to the vet tech who did our intake, the reasons for the appointment and the doctor went back to check our pet. He came back with conflicting answers from Dr Smollin’s on our initial visit, when we mentioned this he backpedaled and made us feel so unsure about the exam our pet had just received. One of our main concerns that we had was that our pet’s belly was distended and protruding out to the right. We asked the Dr to check this and his response was that our pet is  overweight and they can’t see anything wrong. To finish off the disappointing visit, they gave us a copy of the bloodwork we had done (after asking for it multiple times and calling them again to bring it out) and it had another pet’s name, breed, weight, and age on it. We called them from the parking lot again to confirm that the results were in fact ours, they assured us that they were. Upon calling a few days later in need of another copy of the itemized bill for our records, we learned that they had logged her entire appointment under another animal. While we understand and respect how stressful and overwhelming the current climate is, and how busy the clinic must be, all of these oversights has us questioning the accuracy of our pet’s exam.

We are incredibly grateful that we decided to go elsewhere for a second opinion as 3.5 liters of fluid were just drained from our pet’s abdomen. At this stage we are working to find the underlying condition causing the fluid buildup, and are hoping that we can keep her comfortable and happy for the rest of her days.

We are extremely disappointed to know that our pet has been in pain since not receiving the care and attention that should have been provided on our last trip to Winnetka Animal Clinic. We will not return.<//Text>

Dr. Lee refused to believe me when I said she had lost so much weight and said he couldn't find anything wrong with her. Her symptoms got worse so we came back a couple weeks later and spent another large sum of money. After a few more weeks we finally got see another veterinarian and they confirmed she had a liver disease that had progressed too far at this point and she died the very next day. I feel confident in saying the neglect and lack of care this place showed directly lead to my cat dying at the young age of 10. I would never bring anything I care about to this place and would caution anyone looking for a new vet to look elsewhere.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I have been going there for years. Absolutely wonderful.  Dr. Smolin is amazing as far as I'm concerned and even though he was away the other day when I took my dog, the vet filling in was wonderful and took care of the problem.  She gave my dog a shot and by the time we left he had already started to feel better.  The staff is always kind and compassionate.  I highly recommend this vet.< /Text><pics>None</pics></record>

Yes great doctor and staff, However If you have your pet put to sleep  and want to cremate your animal. DO NOT let then make the arrangements. Call Rainbow to Heaven, They pick up the same day and cremate within 3 days. This office puts your pet in a freezer with other pets. Pick up is on Wednesday only.
I was beside myself to learn my dog was froze like a pop cycle, and she was to remain that way for a week in the office freezer. Until I called several other places. Rainbow to heaven picked her up cremated her and returned her to my home in 3 days. They treat your pet like a deceased family member. Not shove them in a freezer with other deceased pets until the crematory makes its rounds to all the different vet offices. They even use body bags and gurneys to pick up.

As for treatment and care they are the best while the animal is alive. I have been with this place 17 years. I think they need to explain the method they use for cremation . So people are aware of what's happening . I also think people are unaware of their options .<//Text>

<text>My family and I have been taking our fur babies to see Dr. Smollin for 30 years at least. He is an amazing human being and veterinarian who truly cares for all animals and treats them wonderfully. He is so gentle and you can tell he makes his little patients feel safe in his care. The staff members are also very helpful and professional! I will be incredibly sad the day that Dr. Smollin decides to retire because I don’t know who else I would trust with my cats.< /text><username>Kristie Torres Silver< /username></record></dataset><record>

Staff is great, friendly and always attentive, Dr. Smollen is so caring, he always answers my questions and concerns when it comes to my Pheebee, she was spayed there too, I was so worried because Pheebee is a senior girl, but they put my worries at ease. They care a lot about their customers. And the price is always reasonable. They are all so kind in the front office l, I love going to a vet where they remember your name and your pets name it makes me feel like they actually care about there patients! They certainly do! Again I recommend anyone to take their dogs to see Dr. Smollen.<//Review>

<date>1556507708908</date><rating>1< /rating><Pics>None</Pics><Text>Good luck bringing your pet when they are in pain or sick! They will schedule an appointment when it's convinient for them or when the doctor is not super busy. Was even useless to ask for the vet to give me a call back to suggest what I needed to do to ease the uncontrollable shaking, to ease the pain for my dog's ear infection, until we get to see the doc the following day...no call back from the vet either. Ended up taking my dog to emergency hospital during the normal business hours( never mind the 4 hr wait and 200+ bill) Winnetka animal clinic basically refused the services to treat my dog when needed, and their RECEPTIONIST  diagnosed my pet over the phone and decided the ear inflection can wait for another 24 hours.They also suggested that I should have called in advance, NOT the same day. Are u kidding me?! Am I scheduling a massage here or trying to book the cruise? The minute I saw my dog was not well and in pain I called!!! If you can't bring your pet to your regular vet during normal business hours because he is completely overbooked...more than definitely find another vet!!!!</Text></record>

<text>Just relocated back to California after 30 years  from Hawaii with my little one-year-old puppy cha-cha ,  which was a birthday gift to me last year from my granddaughter who lives here in Northridge  and also owns a Yorkie  named Franklin;  after my first visit with Dr. Smollen today,  I will be recommending him to my granddaughter as well!!  I found he and his staff to be friendly, receptive, knowledgeable and genuinely caring  Which is very important to me having spent so much time in the Hawaiian islands and getting used to what we called  the Aloha Spirit (love) and Ohana where  everyone is family !!!  Found Winnetka animal clinic to be Ohana for me and my Cha-cha now.
So if you’re looking for a place that makes you feel like  home And with people that care about your pets needs,  then I would highly recommend this facility with Dr. Smollen.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>5<//Rating><Date>1551963626731< /Date>< response>

<Text>I've been coming here for a while now I had a chihuahua for over 16 years and I was playing with him when I accidentally knocked his tooth out he was really old so I went to a clinic on Ventura in studio city and they said I dislocated his jaw which was bs they sedated him and tried taking out his tooth which they weren't able to do still charged me 300 I was so upset then I came on Google and found this place I brought my dog the next day and they extracted his tooth without a problem and charged me $75 and gave me meds for him unfortunately he passed away a few months later 💔. Now I'm a mommy to another 🐶 and I bring him here they are amazing!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Dr  smollin is amazing. He does have an amazing calming affect on animals. I have cats and one of them is very terrified of strangers but when Dr Smollin handles him he calms down and feels safe. I live far away but contunue to go back for all my non- emergency visits.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Such a great church! It is a large congregation but the bible study groups and special events help things feel smaller. Sometimes you have to speak up a little to be noticed, but it is worth it as the congregation is incredibly kind once you get to know them. Pastor Jonathan and the associate pastors help everyone feel welcome, whether they have been Christian their whole life or are just curious about the faith. I'd definitely recommend it, especially for people that are interested in having a first time church experience.<//Text>< pics>

He knows how to translate the Gospel by putting it into  the context and  challenges of our time and place In the world. He can flat out preach like no other pastor in my life has ever preached.

This has been my home church for almost 20 yrs. Through those years there have been changes but the Word of God has been shared from the leadership faithfully. A wonderful group of Christians who I call family.< /review>

I'm revising this review only because I've been exposed to other denominators and have been to churches (orthodox, catholic, etc). Look, in comparison to other churches in the area, and quite frankly, everywhere nowadays, it's the same thing. You'll get your singing and preacher, but no liturgy with a priest aka the real deal. The only upside to rolling hills over its competitors is its large following and top of the line facility. In the words of another review I found, "Even though they're not actual Christians, this is one of the nicest McChurches I've been to in a while! Now of only any of their religious leaders understood a single part of the Bible, then I'd give them 4 stars".< /review>

<Review>I wanted to amend my prior comment. I tried void it altogether but am not computer savvy enough to do it.

I made a comment about the pastor as to his work ethic a few months ago.

I didn’t have all the facts about the circumstances and was wrong about his efforts.

My family and I stuck with Jonathan and Rolling Hills and glad that that we did!

He and Rolling Hills are great!< /Review>< pictures>

Our staff, volunteers and Church family love and appreciate Pastor Jonathan and are glad we can shed some light on this. What people may not always be aware of is the few occasions Pastor Jonathan is not with us on Sundays have been to be apart of a fantastic cohort our board was able to get him into that gathers lead pastors together to engage the big questions around leading growing churches in the 21st century - we are so grateful he's been able to be a part of this! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions."}</resp>

The worship is extremely powerful with incredible music lead by worship pastor Philip. The messages are always relevant and always based on the Bible. The interim pastor Jeff Bigelow is super kind and is always there if your in need of prayer. Pastor Jeff always delivers an incredibly powerful and moving message every Sunday. They also have so many excellent programs to help get you plugged into the church. I have been serving on the usher/greeter team for a little over a year now and it has been an incredible experience. Thank you Rolling Hills for being just the right church that I need!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>What a wonderful and welcoming church! I really look forward to and enjoy our Pastors sermons and the great band. I make a bee like almost every Sunday because I am truly fed by the message. Ive tried several churches and they were great but my heart and mind really connect here.<//review>< rate>

Worship service was great!  The message was fantastic.   They did an alter call, but I would have liked it to be a little more personal. People are very friendly and they have a very nice facility for kids and church service.  They have a lot of parking, which is nice.<//Text>

Rolling Hills Church is an amazing church. It is a place where anyone and everyone can come worship.  The music is equivalent to being at a live concert with phenomenal performers.  The pastor and his messages are very informative, and energetic, which stimulates your mind.  Its definaley a place where anyone who has never been to church,  or had a negative experience with church, should come and see what a great place Rolling Hills Church really is.👍<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I was under the impression that church was supposed to help those in need. I went here for a couple months, nobody so much as said welcome when I entered, and when I poured my heart out in desperation through an email, they didn't even respond. I literally almost gave up on god after that. luckily another church responded to my call for help. It's just too big and impersonal here. Don't go here if you have ever made mistakes in your life.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I go to this park a lot. there's plenty of room to learn how to ride a bike, skateboard or anything of that sort. they have a set of gymnastics rings which is pretty unique to this park along with two pull up bars, and two sets of parallel gymnastics bars. this park also has a bathroom which is always great if you're planning to stay a while.<//Review>

Lovely neighborhood park by day, parking lot full of miscreants by night.

Pros: Maintained bathrooms, play area, basketball courts,  workout area, and lots of nice, neighborly folks walking their pets.

Cons: Trash littered by said miscreants such as condoms, cigarette packs, and plastic containers. Most of the trash is contained to the parking lot so there's that.

Hey kids, don't be gross and pick up your garbage. You're not any less cool for using a trash bin, promise.

All in all, still a really nice park!</Review>

< Review>
This is the best high school ever (though I've only been to this one)! Etiwanda has the most caring teachers that push their students to succeed, as well as the coolest principal. Though High School can be a peculiar time in everyone's life, Etiwanda staff indefinitely are the best in paving the way for students to reach their academic goals. To all current and new students, have fun and don't procrastinate.</Review>

They helped my daughter get a great mix of classes to further her professional career. We are all looking forward to being involved with Etiwanda High School. Thank you Mr. Jaramillo. :)</Review>< pics>

1.  Extremely UNORGANIZED
2.  RUDE
3.  LAZY - NEVER RETURN PHONE CALLS
4.  LIARS! - One staff will tell you a different procedure or information and another staff will have a different version of such. PLEASE PUT YOUR STORIES TOGETHER.
5.  GUIDANCE OFFICE - NONE OF THE COUNSELOR RETURNS CALLS!
Tip:  If you brought in a box of BAGELS, CUPCAKES or SOME KIND of PASTRIES, they are like PIRANHAS as if they never ate in YEARS.  GUIDANCE COUNSELORS - NEVER GUIDE THE STUDENTS, NEVER THERE (ALWAYS NO-ONE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICES).
6.  Principal - Mr. J., YOU MUST DO SOMETHING!!!  THIS IS THE SAME ATMOSPHERE SINCE 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, even now, 2014 under your leadership.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Etiwanda is the best high school you can choose. Get involved and get to know your counselors and teachers and school will be a breeze. Etiwanda is home to some of the most caring teachers and staff and anyone who gets the privilege to go here should be grateful. Eagle Pride.<//Text>

Things in school were good during my freshman year, great people and atmosphere, even the memories. But all of that changed when sophomore year began. Teachers lacked in effort and care, increase in bullies, inappropriate often sexualized behavior took place and almost everyone I knew including myself couldn't keep their grades on track.  The only true caring and hard working teacher I could reflect on was my freshman year English teacher, Eric Hall. As a result of carelessness and neglect from the rest of the school, I departed from the district. I was so fed up with having to deal with the stress and anger I had felt in that school. I highly recommend to NOT enroll your child into this school, the only accomplishments they will achieve is repeating the same subjects over again.<//Review>

It's sad that when you enroll your child into a school. That you have to worrie about him being bullied and no one staff wise seems to care. You take it up with everyone. But somehow they seem to be able to dodge you. As a concern parent, my husband and I believe that the one safe place should be your childs school. And let's not even discuss the non organize office staff, or when you call and it seems no one knows anything. Education should be first not last. You have to go behind almost every teacher to ensure your child is being graded fairly and that they are actually teaching and dictating. There needs to be a overall change in the structure of this school. And I mean asap!!< /text>

<user_name>Birdy</user_name><Text>This is a good school by that I mean teachers and students, the school has many many issues like their parking/drop off situation! It's a nightmare! On top of all police out there giving out parking tickets? Where the heck do you want us to drop off our kids at?, your only solution is drop off your kids 1 hour early?, pick them an hour late? Ridiculous, this school is overcrowded!!, lunch lines are ridiculously long, 15 mins in line, and 5 mins to eat!, people are building more houses up there which means more students attending that overly crowded money making machine of a school! wow, before you take in so many students you should  request for the Cities , School District to make your school bigger! More parking! More drop off lanes! These are issues that need to be addressed with these people! Parents attend the board meetings!

For my experience with my kids it's a good school, the Principal Mr Jaramillo trying to give at the students all the tools to be suscesfull . The result depend about what the student want to be and how many time put you like a parent to be with your Son or Daugther.

Worst high school ever.

Pros:
Nothing

Cons:
Why tf do you eat outside in the sun, why don't you actually build a cafeteria. What if people don't wanna roast in the sun?
most classes are in portables
Financially unstable
10/10 staff (sarcasm)
people there aren't great at all
No lockers
doesn't follow the traditional high school constructions
does not look a regular american high school. more like some weird third world version of what you call a ghetto.<//Text>

They have great tasting seafood. It is rare that i say that about any reateraunt. My go to is their Fish Tacos and let me tell you, they are so good that anyone who would dare try to eat one of my fish tacos of my plate, will get a serious beat down. Yeah, they are that good. Next time your in town  or craving  sea food, this is the place you want to go to. Hands down, great food with some serious kick and succulant flavor.<//review>

The worst place to savor a Mexican style shrimp and octopus  coctel Camaron con pulpo) it seems like they have no idea of the essential ingredients/condiments or garnishes of that dish I went there with my wife a d my little girl  I ordered 2 large shrimp coctel and a ceviche tostada,I was going to eat there but for personal reasons we decided to take it to go.  After driving for 10 minutes to enjoy our  food we started eating after the second scoop we quickly discovered that the order was wrong and the portions were half the amount and there was no octopus,no avocado or the other garnishes that go along with that dish what so ever. So we thought anything body can make a  mistake and every body deserves a second chance to make it right, so I took the food back and told them that it was wrong that it was missing ingredients and condiments such as one of the main ingredients avocado I was told that they don't use that main ingredient in the shrimp coctel,we have eaten that same dish in dozens of restaurants and taquerias and we never have to ask for avocado or the other ingredients/condiments I  showed them the resit for what I pay for they agreed to fix it. What happened after that totally piss me off they topped off  the container with juice and put crumbs of octopus instead of peace's like any other place that serves this dish and they said that the avocado was at no charge this time. I opened the container and I saw the  crumbs of octopus and two  little tiny pieces of avocado flying on top of all the shrimp juice I  told them that I wanted my money back after an hour and a half later and they refused because I already had taste the food.
I  highly encourage the workers and ownbers of this establishment to taste the same dish elsewhere for example mariscos las islitas in watsonville if they could manish to copy 50 percent of their recipe  they could stop selling their mediocre dish. The one star is for the waitress she was ok.< /Text>

This place is bomb!! I know me some good ceviche and this place has incredible ceviche de pescado! I literally wanted to throw it up just to eat it again!! Like that bro! The fish tacos, AMAZING, and the green salsa off the hook. Alexa, the cashier, she was just as awesome as the ceviche! Not only did she provide great service, but as I waited for my delicious meal she fed a homelessman that sat outside 💗Thanks Mariscos Nayarita for the amazing take out experience that took place in my place humble CRV 😀<//Text>

Music box was so dam loud you have to YELL out your conversation to the people next to you. 6 TV screans. What the heck for?  Defiantly not  a 4 star feel. Although meals came out one at a time and a bit over cooked they were tasty. Table service ranked the highest here. I don't think I'' be back.</Text>

<review>"Shrimp tacos" were breaded seemingly formerly frozen shrimp bits with white sauce in a tortilla. Their salsa that came promptly with chips was hotter than the sun. My partner couldn't eat any. It appeared to be jalapenos blended up with water. Not good. Service was ok.< /review>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><text>I tried this place for the third and final time. I waited in line to place a to-go order. The woman at the register took an order from the person in front of me then proceeded to take orders from tables. The people waiting in line behind me went ahead and gave an order to another woman that was going around the counter. After she took their order she went into the kitchen to run their order (I presume), then came out and walked over to service tables. 15 minutes passed from the time the person behind me ordered to the time another woman answered the phone. The phone which was right in front of me next to the register. I was not acknowledged, not even to say that someone would be right with me to help. The third woman took an order by phone then took off again! It was unbelievable! I must have been in there a total of 25 minutes without being helped AT ALL! I will not be returning here, nor will I be recommending this place to anyone.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808e1b0ca503c511:0x3290f51bbad5930f</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>The place is very good if you like delicious mexican style seafood and having a few beers only few set backs would be the overall price and the slightly agressive eye contact from other people eating there. If your in the area i recommend trying the shrimp empanadas or the bacon wrapped shrimp. Expect to spend at the very least 25 to 30 dollars a person.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Service was alright. Somewhat slow. They made up for it by serving promptly after they realized they had not attended to us. The seafood was good but could use some improvement  ( ie longer marinated periods, carefully deshelled shrimp. ). The dozen of oysters were fresh and at a buck each, good for the price. The drinks were good and we were given a basket of chips and salsa as an intro appetizer.  Overall, 3/5. Decent place and affordable for the quantity given.<//review>< pictures>

This place has very bad service. I went in a couple times and charged me more for an item that I did not receive. However, this isn't the first time this happens. I unfortunately ordered couple of foods with certain things that they did not care to take note.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The worst place to eat seafood, the waitresses seem to be new, the floor is dirty, the tables are pegasus, the bathroom is the worst, the canteen is fine, but as a restaurant it leaves a lot to decorate,
, And last but not least, the avocado in your cocktail is extra and if you ask for it they will serve it if you do not ask for it you do not have avocado, if you are from Nayarit or Sinaloa, you must make a complaint or a comment because the seafood is really out of date Even in Michoacán they don't sell seafood that bad customers and with that texture and flavor.

I do not recommend it at all😠

😄😣😦😩 by the way it is not cheap, also not for cheap they have the right to serve poor quality food

(Original)
El peor lugar para comer mariscos, las meseras parecen que son nuevas, el piso sucio, las mesas pegasas, el baño de lo peor,  cómo cantina está bien, pero como restaurante deja muchísimo que decorar,
, a y por si fuera poco el aguacate en tu cóctel es extra y si lo pides te lo sirven si no lo pides no tienes aguacate, si eres de Nayarit o Sinaloa, debes poner una queja o un comentario xq la verdad esos mariscos están muy trasnochados, ni siquiera en Michoacán venden unas mariscos así de mal clientes y con esa textura y ese sabor.

No lo recomiendo para nada😠

😄😣😦😩por cierto no es barato, además no por barato tienen el derecho de servir comida de mala calidad< /Text>< Pictures>

Yeah.....gonna call it as it happened, drove by late saw it appeared open called and indeed they were open.  Pull up. Walk in and instantly the smell of ....like raw sewage.  I pulled my mask aside thinking maybe my mask was funky then realize the inside of the store smelled. I'm talking gag reflex strength smell.
My taco bell was delicious.... apropos I guess on Cinco de Mayo.</Review>

<review>Great value. Especially if you get the coupons in the mail or download the app. I like the grilled beef & the shrimp. My son the tilapia. They also have a good cheese cake. Friendly, fast. I also prefer the NOT SO FRIED RICE & the steamed vegetables.
They do a good job social distancing. Go in throw one door, out throw another..Face mask that cover both mouth & nose mandated.
Clean.</review>< Pics>

<review>Yoshinoya it's great for a late night bite.
My favorite is the habanero chicken and the barbecue beef with the not so fried rice and their clam chowder is pretty good.</review>< pics>

<Review>Brown rice needs flavor and the orange chicken ain’t that saucy. It ain’t even much they gave me. I order a large plate, it’s nothing like what I order out here in them local Chinese foods. Panda does it better. Well at least I tried yoshinoya, I wouldn’t recommend nobody to eat yoshinoya. Waste of my money. Wasn’t worth it.< /Review>< Pics>

When it was mine turn to order I asked for a kids beef bowl. They reused the chicken from the mans order for my beef bowl and gave the man his order without sauce. They fixed his order and didn't give me what I asked for which was BEEF! The servers are pigs.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>This place was very near our hotel so we gave it a try. You order at the counter and the food is brought to you at your table. Prices are quite reasonable - especially for the Los Angeles area. We ordered Asian BBQ wings which were delicious, some spring rolls - also delicious and a large beef bowl. This one wasn't really what we expected. The beef was kind of soft without a lot of flavor. We were expecting something like a soy or teriyaki flavor. This place is certainly worth a visit if you are in the mood for Asian food< /Text></record>

Loved It!!! If I had the money, I'd open one of these in my town. They have the best rice bowls anywhere at any price, bar none. And their prices are great too! If you ever get the chance to, check out their food. They have a variety of dishes now. You'll be glad you did!<//Text>

The food good just like any yoshinoya but the cashier is very rude along with the security they have there never had the feeling to complain about a fast food restaurant then today the cashier came to where me and my family were sitting complaing about how we ate and was standing there looking at us as we ate for 5 mins i asked her to please have spme respect and leave us alone and she got all ghetto on me and then the security got all in my face was reall uncomfortable and disrespectful we paid good money not to be treated this way</Text>

<text>Love this spot, great peeps to interact with and Alize is a shy young lady, but, seems on point.  Clean environment, plenty of space to eat, but, parking is scarce.  Food not too badly priced too, taxes in Inglewood is higher, so, that alone makes your bill higher.  Did you read any of my previous reviews, I'm cheap to a point. lol< /text>< pictures>

It was okay.  Really.  Not bad, not good, just okay.  Cheap.  The steak had good flavor, but a lot of gristle.  "Not Fried" rice was good.  Employees were friendly and efficient.  Restroom not particularly clean.</Text>

<review>Food is nothing to remember, but okay to stuff you so not hungry. Wouldn’t call it Japanese food, probably an insult to their cuisine. Meat choice of fishy tilapia, chicken teriyaki... and mushy boiled vegetables over rice, Staff is friendly.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Oh my god.sushi like I never had before. an incredible once in a life time experience! Chef Yoshinoya America, Inc.really lived up to his name. The bill was the only difficult part, 400 a person, but it was all worth it. This is definitely a meal I will remember til the day I die.< /Review>

I am very disappointed at this Yoshinoya. I have been coming here for years and never got disappointed. Just picked up friends from the airport that came out to visit from out of town...  I figured I take them here since they never had Yoshinoya. We order large chicken combos  and clam chowder. The chicken was burnt and the clam chowder was spoiled. It had a spoiled smell to it like old milk. I ordered a chicken combo with noodles and no veggies. Instead I got noodles with veggies mixed into my noodles. It was like eating bad food that’s been left out the day before...... Because we live across town and already was on the freeway it was no point in turning and coming back....  Yoshinoya, please have your workers check to make sure nothing is spoiled before serving it.</review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Healthy food Japanese style. I recommend the teriyaki chicken bowl;The beef is ok,but the honey walnut shrimp didn't taste right. I want to try their grilled tilapia;It looks good. Make sure that the delicious broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage aren't overcooked; because then they're mushy,and you must try the pickled ginger.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Thr neighborhood is kind of rough. There were three hungry guys outside the restaurant asking for food and offering up their buy one get one free coupon. We ended up just buying them each a bowl of whatever they wanted and letting them keep their coupon. The staff at the store was friendly helpful and attentive. She kept our orders separated from the three orders that we got foe the gentlemen. It was fast, clean, and filling. One of their two unisex bathrooms was operational but the door jams so she was quick in helping to get it unjammed for us before she helped the next customers. She was awesome! I gave thebplace 3 stars but they get another star cuz of her.< /Review>< Pictures>

I love this place just not where it's located but it isn't a bad restaurant it just makes it look bad because of all the bums hanging out there sometimes. The workers are nice and friendly. They're fast too.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Although it is located in an area with poor security, the shop itself was not particularly rough and was normal.
Miso soup was a bit disappointing, but it's not bad for a beef bowl to eat overseas.

治安が悪い地域にありますが、お店自体は特に荒んでるわけでもなく普通でした。
味噌汁がちょっと残念でしたが、海外で食べる牛丼としては悪くないです。< /Text>< Pics>
