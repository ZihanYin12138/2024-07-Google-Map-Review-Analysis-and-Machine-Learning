I got Madeline here as a puppy almost 7 years ago. She was the calendar cover pup for the 2014 publication and is the most wonderful pup I've owned. I had to wait about 4 weeks so she could big enough to spay before she went home with us. She's been a wonderful addition to our household and is still a "pup" I will have for a long time! Thank you Oakland Animal Shelter. I'm so glad we found you when we did and you had a wonderful addition for our family!!!

<time>1557714973870<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>So you want a dog.  I decided I did and looked in all the wrong places.  While I own a home with a fenced yard, all the rescues were determined to decide on the right dog for me. I wanted to decide myself.  And I sure didn't want a puppy.  So I started looking on Craigslist too.  Someone suggested I try the OAS on a regular basis focusing just on dogs newly available for adoption, since I didn't want a chihuahua or a pit bull/mix.  This is how we met Ivy.  We had one play session and headed back two days later.  On that day we decided she would come home with us.  Let me point out that unlike rescues, OAS fees are remarkably reasonable, especially if you are a (ahem) senior. Ivy isn't  perfect, but neither are we.  She is leash reactive and we have worked on this since we got her.  She is sweet in a dog park, and seems to be smarter than her owners.  It;'s been a wonderful year with her. Give OAS  a chance.  if you are lucky, you will find a remarkable dog before he or she is pulled by one of the rescues, and for a lot less money.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5YCVElJ2Grd2YBrO9cwXoR-xvY8m8g5LtUmbj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

While some of the negative aspects mentioned by others are true, this place is clearly understaffed and it has a lot of volunteers helping out. Wait times can be long, they may not all be on the same page regarding an animal's information... but, you know what? They are trying their best and, more important they REALLY CARE about the animals. For me, that's what matters most. We adopted a 3-month-old cat some time ago, and he's been in great health ever since. I wouldn't hesitate to get my next pet from Oakland Animal Services again.<//Text>

This comment is toward the the SPCA part of this facility. We caught a rabbit that was running around my neighborhood for a week plus and took it to the Hayward animal shelter and  was referred to SPCA ON Baldwin st. But when I got there, because of where I live. They would not take this rabbit.  Then referred to Oakland animal shelter.  Knowing that I live in San Leandro. I went there because I was referred.  It's a sad day for this Bunny. I don't think I will catch anymore strays to keep the from harm or hit bye cars anymore because of this.<//review>

I went in to adopt a Cat. Absolutely no one greeted me or instructed me on what to do when I arrived. The staff behind the. Punter was incredibly cold. Stood around 10 minutes before I was able to sign up for an adoption.

Waited 30 minutes just to find out the cat we wanted was adopted. I looked at some other cats and found one I wanted but they “closed” adoption at 5:30 which no one had ever mentioned to me. By this time I had been there an hour and decided to leave. I looked at all the cats one more time on the way out. A staff member was prepping another cat for a viewing even tho they just told me adoption had closed. I feel like they lied about closing adoption at 5:30 or something. No idea why but they were absolutely still allowing people to view and adopt pets.

This was a terrible experience over all and I won’t be going back.<//text>

< Review>
This shelter is  clean and spacious and the staff seems friendly and caring. However, they are not as familiar as they should be about their animals. We adopted our dog from them and they told us the dog was friendly with other animals. This turned out to be far from the truth. Our dog is very aggressive with all other animals. Since she is an only dog and we always keep her leashed when out of our house, it has worked out OK anyway and we have had her for 9 years and love her dearly. We just can't take her to the dog park. Also this shelter does not test for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) which is a virus that compromises a cat's immune system and makes them susceptible to cancer and other diseases. My son adopted his cat from them and a year and a half later the cat got a very aggressive cancer. Turns out he was FeLV positive. Since he was an indoor cat and never came in contact with other cats, it seems that the shelter is the only place he could have picked up the virus. It's possible that he had the virus when he came to the shelter. Unfortunately, this means that he may have passed the virus to other cats at the shelter. We had to put him to sleep yesterday and it was so sad. So be aware that this shelter does not test for this virus and you may want to have any cat you are thinking of adopting independently tested especially if you have other cats in your home as this virus is very contagious.</Review>

I want to say the 3 starts is a mixture of a 1 star experience and a 5.

The one star is because this older lady with short hair and glasses decided it would be a good idea to tell me and my husband that since we have a small child we should adopt a dog around 7 years old or up. So families with small children are not allowed to choose?? It was very off-putting.

The 5 star review is because there is an amazing staff member named Teegan (not sure if I spelled that right) who took the time to listen to what we wanted and inform us on the dog we were interested in. She was very respectful, kind and funny. I could tell just how much she cares about the animals and her work. I would recommend talking to her because she is respectful and honest.< /review>

A place for rescued animals to be helped and placed in homes. Some of the staff and all the volunteers I met were very helpful and knowledgeable. It can be rather sad to see all these animals waiting for their prospective adoptive families but this place really does the best it can. The facility is clean and a care is taken to ensure that these animals are placed in good homes. If you are poking for a pet, consider adopting.</Review>

I called about an injured stray dog in my area, I was told that an officer would be there "shortly" so I decided to wait with the animal as it's a busy road. I called an hour later and was met with the same disgruntled woman who took my call, told me it wasn't her fault I was waiting with the dog. Called the non-emergency police line and they were much more understanding of the urgency of the situation. If you want someone to tell you to stop caring, this is the place.</text>

The process of adopting my cat Rollo / Coco was comfortable with the support of the Oakland animal shelter staff. They patiently waited as my daughter and I visited with each animal. They cleaned the visitation area between each visit allowing us time to decide if we wanted to bring our pet home.They process included verifying his vacinations were update  and that he is microchiped. I'm happy to say that our pet is has made himself at home and is a loving part of our family.</text>

PLEASE READ BEFORE ADOPTING:
Oakland Animal Services Director, Rebecca Katz is running a very very poor operation, I’m sad to say. What I have learned from my experience adopting my dog is that:

1.) OAS agrees in writing to pay for medical care during foster, and they DO NOT PROVIDE THIS CARE. They do not have the funds to provide this care because of poor leadership and they don’t have a vet on staff to even provide this care.
2.) They do not have a regular vet on staff checking dogs, because they cannot retain one (big red flag), so the dogs going to all of these public adoption events (with other dogs present) are riddled with infections. Mine was one of them.
3.) The vets that come in to do spay surgery prior to ownership are discovering the dogs are also sick, needing far more than just a spay when they are received. Then they scramble to provide the last minute care they can before putting the dog in the owner’s arms for good that same day.
4.) They are telling people AFTER ADOPTION PAPERS ARE SIGNED that the dogs are terribly ill and need extensive, costly care for said infections. They then leave it on the owners to foot the cost.
5.) When I approached the Director, Rebecca Katz, telling her this experience, requesting medications to treat the dog’s infections, she at first offered to give Lola some extra medications. Then after reading the dog’s chart rescinded that offer because it was too costly to her.  This woman only thinks of her bottom line.  Welfare of dogs is not her top priority.
6.) The Director then requested I return the dog to the shelter, which she admits cannot afford to provide even minimal care, and said she would find ANOTHER SHELTER to place Lola in that could provide care. This is after the dog has lived with me for a month and has bonded with our family.  That was the solution Rebecca Katz AT OAS was able to offer after this shitshow.  To remove the dog from a loving home, and dump the dog at another shelter on someone else's dime instead of providing her necessary medications.

I'm keeping the dog, nursing her back to health myself despite the ridiculous position I've been put in financially by OAS, and will rehome her myself if costs become an issue.  But I will never, EVER take an animal to OAS.  The animals and the humans deserve far better!!!

I have had 2 encounters with them and they were great. 1- when I found a dying cat @ 10pm, stayed up with it in my house all night, and drove to OAS in the morning to have them try to save it. I waited outside for about 20 minutes and an employee showed up. They took the car and my info and I left. They then called me 4 hours later to let me know that it had passed away while under vet care. It wasn’t even my car. Very sweet of them. 2- an opossum was hit on Fruitvale during rush hour 7am and was still alive trying to crawl to the side of the street. I stopped traffic and scooped him up in a box and called the Oakland police non emergency number. They got ahold of an animal control officer from OAS and he came and got it within an hour. The place wasn’t even open yet. Great service for such an understaffed group trying to serve all of Oakland. For you disgruntled folks; just like an emergency room I’m sure the calls are triaged, so the dog that chased you as you ran through the park might not be a top priority when other animals are in distress and dying. 5 stars from me!< /review>

<Review>I rescued my beautiful red nose from Oakland Animal Services 1 year ago, and she has turned out to be the best dog i could have ever wished for. Now at 1.5 years old, she is so well behaved and so smart, i feel blessed to be able to spend time with such an amazing animal every day. Thanks OAS for helping me find my best friend.<//Review>< name>

<Review>Today I picked up my new baby terrier dog for years old from the Oakland animal shelter. Which should have been best day of my life after losing my beautiful chocolate lab to cancer and deciding to adopt a dog from the shelter again was very disappointing in hurtful experience.  EVON 0r Yvonne front desk &Eric  manager were horrible. Why do they work there??
WHAT happened was I came to adopt a dog on July to 30th I saw peppers and I also saw another dog name wasabi hearable to same age and I wanted to get both of them because I have a house I own it in I have a lot of space in a lot of times in some a hole home owner and business owner I am able to take the dogs everywhere with me even to the office etc. So I decided to pick 2 small dogs to rescue them and save them from being euthanized. I walked both dogs spent time separatly and said that I wanted to get both. we start the paperwork after a while they said that we needed to get a Room for dog's to meet to make sure that they will be comfortable with each other. That never happened ! instead a young Caucasian women early 20th or thirties came out and said no !
I say why she said because wasabi growled at pepper when they was playing one day. I said that's normal plus ar
they stressed out they are
homeless and have lost their families.  But...That was a final word!  I did not get  to add wasabi  to my family and it hurt me a lot to see him today still behind the cages looking sad and helpless. I still can't understand why if the dogs are up for adoption that I can't get them both. I'm going to give Pepper the best life I can! I'm grateful  but please adopt wasabi if you can
And give him a beautiful home I will
feel so happy . OR if you could speak up and help me get him, that will be even better. PLEASE I'm a tax payer in  community, business owner, homeowner and this is the way I got treated by this agency that prob I pay taxes for to exist. Wow!.. what happened to the Oakland I used to know? This was harder than getting a bank loan. I thought they were there to save animals lives. PEPPER AND WASABI  look under weight. I can't agree with this decision. I am confused & hurt. I just wanted to rescue Wasabi too. I can't stop crying .</Review>< pics>

Sold me a very defective and mentally challenged adult cat. I've had the cat iver a year and a half, and she has tremendous issues. It's hard to believe that the shelter didn't know this.</Text>

They are great!
I adopted my dog Jack and all of the staff and volunteers made my experience good. We spent 4 hours making sure he got along with cats and my existing dog.
Great place to adopt a wonderful new four legged family member.</review>

<Review>It would be nice if these folks answered the phone more than two hours a day, returned phone messages, and responded to emails. Unless you go down there in person you're out of luck. They don't seem to give a damn. Thry did take a suggestion for improving their website so perhaps there's hope.</Review>< pics>

I brought a pet in that I found on the street. The staff was horrible. Gave me some books to look through. ( completely unorganized) then I asked for them to take a picture of the pet which it stated on the paperwork they would. They proceeded to tell me they didn't take pictures. When I called them on it, they guy says oh our printer is not working you need to bring one in. (really????!!!! I was good enough to take time out of my busy day to bring you this pet) Icing on the cake They didn't even check to see if the pet had been microchiped!!!!! The staff here is a joke unprofessional uninformed and uncaring! I guess I shouldn't expect much.... considering they are government employees. Never met a government employee that isn't lazy!!!</Text>< Time>

<Review>They're ok, but if you are considering getting your pet health insurance DO NOT sign up for the free 30 day policy! Since it is only a 30 day policy, now my kitten has a pre-existing condition that won't be covered by any insurance. It's much better to just buy a regular yearly insurance.< /Review><GmapID>0x808f86ee059936e1:0x28cf611be2ee9388< /GmapID>< user>

They try really hard to work with what they have, but there is huge room for improvement. We adopted a pet and it took them 3 weeks to release our adopted dog. I would think that they would process paperwork faster so that they could make room to house other needy animals.<//Review>

Euthanized my understandably distraught neighbor's cat in less than 24 hours after acquiring him. They responded to an anonymous call(s) alleging neglect. The caller(s) was/were grossly under informed about veterinarian care this indoor/outdoor cat had already and was scheduled to receive. Services left no information for the cat owner that they had collected him, neither who, when, where to call. After much confusion and upset, the owner reached a live person at Oakland Animal Services the next day, to find out that her pet of 15 years had been euthanized, and his remains had already been transferred to a mass grave near Sacramento.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>A harrowing morning to find a shivering, growling, making failed attempts to get out, a dog stuck in our front yard gate.  Broke my heart into pieces to see his helpless face. I even unsuccessfully tried feeding him cat food. Oakland Animal Services helped free the dog much to my tearful relief. They were responsive, quick, supportive and very humane to the stuck dog. THANK YOU THANK YOU!! I am a supporter, volunteer of EBSPCA , I am going to add Oakland Animal Services to my list of support here on, so that they can continue their awesome services city wide.

You guys rock!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Time>1416448980389< /Time><review>We love and support this shelter. It has a lot of things going against it, mostly lack of funding. Consider the source city. Hardly enough resources to assist its citizens much less its creatures in need. When we first visited the shelter in 2011, we fell in love with a little guy we adopted that very day. The shelter is so poor that he wore a collar made of medical tape. The volunteers were tired and overworked, but loving and caring to the animals. Those of you so quick to criticize - have a heart, consider the shelter's circumstances, and maybe even lend them a hand, or donate generously. If not you, then who?< /review>< Name>

<Text>This department clearly needs major work. They are not there when you need them and refer you to the police department which refer you back to them even when animal services are closed. I can't even walk my dog to the park because of the fear of encountering a lose dangerous dog. My dogs have been attacked before and Oakland Animal service does not do their job at controlling lose dogs or educating inadequate dog owners who let their dogs out. I refuse to walk my dog to the park around my house anymore. the walk there is hell, being constantly afraid and having so many vicious dogs barking at us acting violently across the fence. This extends to the police department. if they did a better job with violence and fear, people wouldn't have the need to arm their houses with large dogs.</Text>< pics>

my pupp i lost a few years ago whom i thought had died was found from his microchip i caught a flight that next day to get him all the way from texas. i get there and they tell me its 200 dollars to get him :( even after explaining i had spent money flying out there, they wanted me to pay for the person that gave him up fees for having them come get him . They wouldnt offer to work with me on the price instead let me see him through bars with three other dogs in his cage without opening cage or holding him and told me to release him to the  shelter where he will be better off. At a kill shelter ! instead of working with the fines and lowering them i had to give him up .they dont care about the dogs here it seems just an everyday thing for them sad.</text>

My neighbors have two vicious german shepards. They viciously bark at every person including children. The large dogs got out of the house at the least three to four times a week. The dogs antagonize the other dogs in the neighborhood, chase children when they are out and in general terrorize the community. My daughter and I have missed the school bus trying to avoid them. One unfortunate day. I was bit by one of these dogs. I was taken to the emergency room and given shots. I followed up by calling the police and calling Oakland animal services. It has been over six months. No one has responded, the Oakland police department nor Oakland Animal services. I even went to their facebook page to ask for support. I left over ten messages and spoke to reps countless times. Nothing has happened. I live in an impoverished neighborhood, stray dogs and animal attacks are normal. I am disappointed that these dogs are still terrorizing everyone in the community and the OPD And Oakland animal services does nothing to support a safe environment. I'm sure this issue would not go unresolved in an upperclass neighborhood. I have been chased by dogs in this community three times. One time my eight year old daughter had to run with me from a very large pitbull. I'm disgusted in the City of Oakland and Oakland Animal services. Everytime my daughter and I walk out our door we have to be cautious because of the uncontrolled dogs in my neighborhood. As I type this review I can hear the large shepard that bit my viciously barking at passbyers on the street.<//text>

<Review>I was bitten by an unvaccinated dog on 5/23/14 and TRIED to report it and was transferred to non-emergency dispatch at Oakland Police who tranferred me back to Animal Control. I was not able to report it until 5/27/14 and had to drive to the facility on 29th Ave. in order to do so. I received a call on 5/28/14 from them telling me they could not find the address in the computer and it wasn't there. On 5/30/14 I printed out Mapquest directions from Animal Control on 29th Ave. to the unvaccinated dogs address and drove back to Animal Control on 29th Ave. to give it to them. They STILL want to argue that the address isn't there, so I tell them to come to my house and I will point to my neighbor's house for them!!
I even called the Oakland Police Chief's office and the woman there wasn't sure who was in charge, someone named "Chris".  Seriously????
There is NO ONE in charge of this place and they do nothing except what is required of them. So sad for the animals and responsible pet owners. Get it together and do the professional job you are paid for!!!!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This place is a joke we had a stray pitbull wandering around our shop harrasing our employees and customers and this place wouldn't even answer the phone or return one of my several voicemails. The police told us they can't help us because it is animal controls job. I even left a message with their supervisor and still no response. I left several voicemails indicating that the situation is urgent. They say on the answering machine that they only answer the phone from 9am-11 thats a bunch of balony. If you need animal control services I suggest you handle the situation yourself or have someone else help you because these people are absolutely good for nothing.<//review>

But if anyone wants to go here and park in the back, make sure you don't park in the handicap area without placing the handicap place card.  I forgot mine yesterday and didn't display it on the car while parking.  I'm not sure who it was but one of the workers he saw me on cameras not place the handicap place card and made me go move my car and even told me he can call the police.  My 72 year old father was with me too, and I even informed the worker there, that we have the place card and that we just forgot it, and he did not care.  I told him it's ok if parking enforcement comes to give me a ticket, since I forgot the card, this is not a problem they should worry about.  I am a customer coming to pay them and give them business and did not expect to have a problem over a small issue like this.  If you look at the other reviews as well, all of the 1 star reviews Have to do with poor customer service, if this many people are complaining then obviously something isn't right.  I'm surprised the owners of this business still keep around jerk staff like these.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29512da6dd7bd:0xa3885ca8dc2c580a< /gmap_id></record>

Great range for serious shooters.  Very clean and nice range.  They have 14 lanes so you are more then likely not going to have to wait even when they are busy. Really nice and knowledgeable staff. Also great if you want to rent a gun, they have a wide selections I choose from.  Overall a great place to shoot.<//Text>

Enjoyed a fun afternoon at Firing Line with my relatives. We brought our own guns but used FL's ammo. Location has a basic setup with the necessary features. Variety of target printouts for sale at decent prices. Range itself is dated and could use some treatment to reduce the noise level, but overall it is fine and does the job. I'd go back if I was in the area again.</Text>

Went today and i had a pretty pleasant experience. Staff were friendly and courteous and the range itself was not bad at all. However, this is an indoor range and they allow the use of bare lead, unjacketed ammo, which is a major health hazard in an indoor range, and the ventilation system isnt all that great. Great first experience here, but i probably won't be returning as i feel my lead levels would probably skyrocket from coming here consistently.< /Text>

This place is VERY unprofessional. I went in with my dad today expecting to go in with him. I had been to this place before ( about half a year ago ) and was treated really nice, and even been told to come back whenever since I wanted to learn how to handle different types of guns properly. This was my second time going back with my dad who had been coming to this range for around 20 years. The moment we went in I immediately felt the worker target my dad as if he was some sort of danger. He gave us a "safety check" that the guy before us didn't do. They asked him to treat the ammunition in the gun as real ammunition and to unload a loaded gun without breaking any safety regulations. The worker loaded the gun and my dad unloaded the gun facing the ground and gave him the bullets. The worker proceeded to tell him to "try again and remember that everybody in the room counts". He did it again the same way, just more attentive to the way he was doing it as he didn't think there was anything wrong with the way he was unloading the gun. The worker then accused him of "pointing the gun at him TWICE" and kicked us both out saying he couldn't rent out a gun for us. There are no written rules and there wasn't a manager to talk to when we requested it. He kept repeating the same phrase over and over about pointing the gun at others. After going to this place for over 20 years we would never come back. The place discriminates, targets, and has staff that has no knowledge about how to treat its customers. Even if something had been wrong with the way the gun was held, a proper certified instructor would have explained the mistake before the second attempt was made. We had never had a problem like this before so it was extremely disappointing to be treated this way. I would give this place negative stars if I could.<//text>

A great place for locals to go without having to drive too far. The place has a very welcoming atmosphere and excellent staff.14 lanes total split between 2 rooms (7 & 7). A decent selection of the most popular handguns for rental. This is the best indoor range I have been to in the area.
One caveat; the weekends can get busy and packed at night. Unfortunately, that is when the yahoos go so there can be a lot of inexperienced, ignorant, and foolish people in groups (not cleaning up their brass, not following safety/range rules, puffing up and trying to look cool, especially if a girl happens to be in the room or just outside the viewing window). At least they don’t tend to stay long.
Any time I have seen the range officers do have to remind someone of the rules/policies, they always do so politely and with respect.<//review>

Terrible business practice here. Really unfortunate I have to write this review as I was a big fan of the Northridge location. Following the outbreak of Covid the company made the decision to close it's Northridge location. This was after I had purchased a yearly membership at the tail end of January. This means that I was able to use a whole 1.5 months of my 12 month membership before they closed the Northridge location. I completely understand why this happened however it is what followed that causes me to write this review. After finding out the information on closure I contacted the Burbank location by phone 3 times. All 3 times I explained that the two locations left open would be too far for me to travel to and requested a refund of my yearly membership. I was even fair and offered to have them deduct the 1.5 months i was able to use the membership from my refund. I was told I would need to speak to the manager and each of the 3 times the manager was conveniently unavailable. I was told I would receive a call back which I never did. I then proceeded to send multiple emails to the management at the Burbank location and again, no response. I ultimately had to file a dispute through my credit card company and have now finally received my money back. Absolutely terrible business practices and customer service. If you as a company make the decision to close a location then be prepared to deal with the fallout and possible refunds. It's so disappointing that instead you made the choice to cower and ignore any kind of responsibility you have to your customers.

TLDR: Location I frequented closed due to Covid. Management refused to  respond to any refund inquiry on my membership. Had to file credit card dispute. Avoid this range.<//Text>

Knowledgeable, helpful, safety-conscious staff.  Not crowded on a weekday.  Rental gun selection is not as good as at LAX range or LAGC.  Prices about average.  Range reload ammo was good, unlike LAX range's.  Typical length for an indoor range, 50 ft(?), so although they allow long guns there would not be much point.  +1 for being one of few shooting-oriented businesses I have been to lately that does not ostentatiously advertise a certain noxious far-right organization.< /review>

My first time at an indoor gun range. $10 to rent any gun. 9mm ammo was $19 a box. I had a blast. Literally. The staff was polite and very helpful when I mentioned one of the target clamps was broken. They fixed immediately. I'll be back.</review>

<text>Excellent facilities, fair prices, solid rental selection, and most importantly, a safe and friendly atmosphere.

Their membership is an excellent deal and it is wonderful to have such a great business in the LA County area. Other ranges in the area have extensive waiting lines and have way too many first time shooters with questionable safety practices. Even experienced shooters from outside CA find this range to be exceptionally well-run and well-priced.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Eventually found a decent gun range when on vacation to the West with my wifey. Good enough rental variety for me with very reasonable cost. Friendly and professional staff. Very easy to work with and happy to chat with.
IMPORTANT: This is not a range for beginner! Lots of ppl got offended and frustrated in the google review because they don’t know how to handle a weapon safely and properly and got kicked out by the owner I assume.

I will certainly recommend this range.< /Text>< UserId.>

Poor. Not many choices of rentals, expensive. Staff seem like they’re not in the mood to work.

Facilities seem sub-par.

Best take your business elsewhere.

I wasn’t expecting the quality and level of a Texan range but still disappointed.

At least there is parking at the back.< /Text>

<Review>Five stars because they are friendly about bringing your own ammunition. Staff are great. Rental guns are good and the place is not a mess. I liked it. I walked out without feeling like I got ripped off like I feel when I go to the downtown LA gun club. After coming to firing line, I will NEVER go back to downtown gun club.</Review>< gmapID>

After 7 or 8 years of visiting various shooting ranges, I will say this is the indoor shooting range in which I feel the safest seeing as to how they ask every nonmember to demonstrate their firearms safety conduct. If you fail the safety demonstration, they will politely but firmly ask you to leave (so you don't end up endangering other shooters). Before visiting this range, be sure to fully understand and fully obey:
1) The firearms safety rules as outlined by Jeff Cooper
2) The range rules for The Firing Line found on their website
3) How to safely operate any firearm you plan on renting from or bringing to the range

Additionally, their annual membership is reasonably priced and pays off after 9 visits, or 7 visits if you rent one handgun per visit. The range itself is in a good, reasonably accessible location for people living in Los Angeles County, Pasadena, and far east as Rosemead.

Parking: They have 7-9 parking spots in a lot behind the shooting range. There is also street parking very close to the range. Parking was never an issue for me for all of my visits. This shooting range is more busy on the weekends, like most businesses and establishments.

I will end on what I feel is the most important note and I wish there was a way I could emphasize this more but: I am consistently blown away by the professionalism and friendliness of all staff members with each range visit on any given day of the week. This is one of the few ranges where I feel genuinely welcome.</text>

Staff is friendly and helpful. Membership fees are reasonable. Good selection of rental guns. Range is dated but clean. Only negative thing is the ventilation/AC sucks. If you're going in the summer, expect to leave all sweaty. It gets hot and stuffy in the shooting lanes. Other than that, I enjoy going to this range, bought the membership and will recommend to friends.< /Text>

Could use better lighting in the lanes, and better AC in the summer. But other than that, this is a great place to shoot. Professional staff. Good selection of rentable firearms. Plenty of ammo, targets, and shooting supplies you can buy. Clean bathrooms. It's a smaller range with a small parking lot, so it does get full at times. So if you have a group of people, check their busy times to avoid waiting time. Definitely recommend you try it.</text>

I have since then purchased an annual membership to allow unlimited visits and range time!

Definitely a great value!

If it's your first time, please be sure to know how to unload, check, and make a semi-automatic pistol safe while making sure not to point it at ANYBODY. Sadly, but also gladly, I have seen people get denied entry because they were not able to demonstrate safe gun handling.  Youtube is your friend.  They also have beginner classes.  Guys working there are nice but correctly prioritize safety over everything else including nice and friendly. Only issue is other ranges have digital controls that let you know exactly how far your target is. Not a big issue, but it would be nice.< /Text>

Staff is very helpful. We bothered them with many questions and requests and they were able to assist us with no problems everytime. They have a nice selection of guns to rent. The place isn't the biggest but it will do. They have a lounge area and two shooting rooms. Over all a great place to spend an hour or two shooting.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Did a short handgun course here today and had to write the review because of the number of low score reviews already here.
I don't have any experience of other shooting ranges in the U.S., but the staff were friendly, the course helpful, and the safety precautions seemed to fit with a place for firing live ammunition.
I don't get why some people seem to take issue with requiring a high standard of safety.
As someone who doesn't have guns readily available, I felt like I was in good hands and would happily return here, and hope to do so.
Thanks guys.< /text>< Pics>

Firing Line the Best cost (if you don't believe me... COMPARE), and I've gone to lots of shooting ranges!
About customer service all these gun places are the same... these guys deal with guns- most are cocky and arrogant.
I've been a member for years, and I usually, for the most go to the Burbank location and I've noticed a transition where the guys are much friendlier now... and the rules are stringent FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL.</review>

Lanes are short.  I wouldn't recommend any shooter that has had 3 months on a public line to waste their time.  It's ok for new shooters as long as you don't have to hear a lecture about their inner doors from the general manager when the place is empty.  My LA buddies all told me there are better ranges for handgun.  I should have listened to them.<//Review>

<Review>I've only been there once but I think it's a nice compact indoor firing range to practice. I arrived around 1:00pm on a hot, muggy day & had no issues with the staff being rude/mean. In fact, when I arrived, one staff member was in the parking lot helping a young patron roll-start his stick-shift car! I purchased a few targets, used my own .45 FMJ & had a great time. I'm seriously considering becoming a member.< /Review>< pictures>

Great facility. I go often with my family and the staff is always nice to us. They have a huge inventory of rentals including shotguns and handgun caliber rifles. I've seen a few bad reviews from beginner shooters wanting to learn how to shoot, saying they won't teach them. Range officers are not instructors! Sign up for a beginners class to learn safe handling BEFORE you try to stand next to my family with a firearm you don't know how to handle. I don't have a membership yet but will definitely be purchasing one for my family.< /review>

A-holes. Refused my business on the grounds that I was a danger to their customers. What happens to teaching you how you use a weapon? Not here. Was sent packing by some piece of sh** with attitude. Never again. A beginner wanting to learn the proper techniques and willing to pay for it. forget this place. Negative stars if I could.<//Text>

This use to be a great place to shoot.  I moved out of town, so hadn't been in a few years.   It is no longer even a decent place to shoot.  The service and attitude of the staff was incredibly condescending.  The prices are higher than average.. and in short... I did not enjoy my time there.  10 years ago, I use to go in atleast once or twice a week... but now, I have no plans on returning  until changes are made to the staff.<//Review>

First timer and they allowed us into the range alone without any information except how to load the clip. So confused how they treated us when I told them we didn't know anything about firing a pistol. I asked the neighbor for instructions and next thing you know, they claimed I turned around with a loaded gun in hand and confiscated everything from out party and kicked us out. The gun was pointed at the paper the whole entire time. Complete negligence on their part, refusing to instruct and take care of first timers.< /text>

<review>10/28/15 first time at this location. Didn't catch the names of the two guys working but they were fantastic. The range was clean as you'd expect, there was no weird "safety check" that I had to go through either. Answered all my questions about guns with a smile, and even re-locktited my front site for free, and lubed the gun before I left. Excellent experience overall.</review>< pictures>

Like this place! Saw in a previous review that you can't bring your own ammo. Not true, as long as its FMJ you are good to go. Like all gun ranges, they get negative reviews from people with no shooting experience and the inability to demonstrate they can safely handle a gun getting turned away. Really?! I sure don't want someone next to me that has no clue what they are doing. Staff has always been pleasant to me. Only negative is that the range could be a bit brighter.< /Review>

<text>My first time handling a gun, now days you got to be able to protect yourself. I was so nervous since I had never even held a gun before. Luckily my husband is a registered owner and was there with me to guide me and help me with the use of the gun. I would definitely recommend you to go with someone who has experience for sure. For a first timer I did good I got rid of my fear and learned a thing or two about shooting. My arms do feel a little sore and my Lower back feels tight from positioning myself to shoot but it was all with it.   Pricing was okay I guess since this is the only place I’ve been to so can’t compare it to anywhere else. The only thing kind of threw me off was how easy it is to get a gun in there and they don’t even check to see if you are the registered owner of that gun or not. Idk kind seemed weird!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Its an okay shooting range. $22 for a 50 pack of. 45 so fair prices but the range could be better. It's muggy and hot inside the shooting area since the ac isn't too great. There's better ranges available.</Review>

<text>I've seen people fail the test they give you here. It's not complicated, but so many people fail to adhere to the basics.  For the safety of yourself and others, if you have never handled a firearm or if you cannot pass a BASIC test you have to take to rent a gun here, ego aside, you should seek instruction from someone. You will be handling live ammo around others after all.

Their safety precautions are why I choose this range.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Staff is horrible. Customer service is dismal at best. Stay clear of this location. Saftey is definitely not their priority. When asked for help all they would do is snicker and sarcastically/hesitantly give you bad information. As a heads up you may only bring people under the age of 18 if you're 21 or a court ordered "guardian". Funny since the first time I brought someone in a week ago, we were 18/17 respectfully. Guess they never passed elementary school mathematics. In addition a legal guardian has a broad BROAD scope which does include brother/siblings but I guess they were illiterate as well.</text>

Can't give 5 starts because it's not an outdoor range. For a SoCal indoor range, it's pretty good. Very basic. The prominent location attracts a lot of different types of people so they are strict.  Their safety check could be a little better explained up front. It is a very basic check though. Don't muzzle anyone, drop the mag, load a snap cap, insert the mag, load the chamber, drop the mag, clear the chamber.  I passed first time with my wife watching!

They allow pistols, 22lr rifles, and I saw shotgun shells. Can't shoot alone unless you are a member. Don't want any anonymous lone wolf types, you know.<//Text>

pistols only. NO RAPID FIRE!!!(found out the hard way, was told I would get kicked out if happens again). if u take Ur own gun n ammo, no steel case ammo-they check. if u rent a gun u must shoot their ammo! for target practice its ok, for fun(safe) shooting,go elsewhere! !!< /Text>

<Review>Been here twice so far maybe 3 times, staff has always been helpful, low pro & cool. Signed up, flowed right in, n got to shooting. Stayed a few hours. Brought my own ammo and guns but its cool u can rent/try something different have to use their ammo for that which is fine. A little pricey to do that vs byo (FMJ) but convenient to have access to different guns on hand. Not something u can just go easily buy to try. Other people all seemed level so no worries there. Got in, went thru x250 rounds had LOTS of fun. Cant wait to go back.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80c29512da6dd7bd:0xa3885ca8dc2c580a<//gmapID>< Pictures>

Got made fun of.  I am active duty military and went to go check this place out. My friend decided it was a good idea to go here since I was in town on leave. Once I was inside I was helped my an Asian gentleman. He asked us some typical questions.....have you been here before?, Is this your first time?, Do you have any expirience? Etc.
My friend has none but I told the gentleman I did and showed my military I.D.  He showed me an M9 to start. He said it should be easy just remember what they taught you in bootcamp. To which I said they don't teach you about pistols in bootcamp and that has been a year since I graduated. He then said that since I have no weapons training or knew how to use that weapon then I should just leave. It was a slap in the face as if my service and all my training meant nothing.< /text>

The worst ever customer service and the facility is terrible, the only reason I stopped by because it's close to Costco. They don't have any written rules about anything, and still do some kind of "safety check" without even telling you that it's a safety check. And during this useless check the fake bullet got stuck in their pretty unsafe glock 19. I've been shooting for many years and been to a lot of facilities but have never seen anything worse or more unprofessional than this place. They don't even have a manager that you can talk to and when you ask a normal question about their operation they don't know what to answer or where their rules are written down. I wish I could give negative star to this terrible place, the only star is for the location.< /review>

<Review>Came there with my wife and immediately was intimidated into passing test by white bald trashy looking guy, even though I showed him my HSC license.  As I expected, he gave me a story how i failed his biased safe test, when i never pointed gun at anything but floor below, and asked me to give him money for training to become "safe"

You know I have them 2 stars before for the employees rudeness most all of them. But now they take the cake as the worst place to come and shoot. I regret the day I became a member. Every time I come here they set a different rule weekly. There are some employees that know what's going on but others oh man...</Review>

The place is old and the lanes are very short. On top of that the big fat manager is abnoxiously rude. Very unpleasant experience.<//text>

<userid>112966347380218260683<//userid><Response>None<//Response><Review>Location:
Great location with parking space in the back (about 13 total)

Safety:
.There are no range officer inside the two shooting areas
.There are a lots of beginner leading to a lots of gun miss handling (such as not pointing the guns in the safest direction and not reloading guns in the booth)

Staff:
Customer service is overall mediocre because of their cocky attitudes (stay away from Todd)
Anytime you need help it look like you are annoying them

Ammunition:
You can not bring your own ammunition (except for .22lr)
Their reload ammunitions are really dirty
The ammunition is expensive

Gun:
Good selection of the most commun guns on the market.
Gun are no very well clean which leads to jam from time to time.
No shotgun allowed and no rapid fire<//Review><date>1459122073118< /date>< GmapID>

Poor customer service.. We requested to change the lane and instead of offering us to use another lane when most of the range was empty...they kept  finding us excuses to why they can't give us another lane. Not sure I am going there back again< /Review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) The worst shooting range in Los Angeles and surely in the whole of the United States. I shoot in most of the US states but I have never been so disappointed. Firstly no information on the prices, there were 2 of us but can only have one weapon and one line so each take turns, in other words no one. A really poor choice of handgun and even worse semi automatic rifle. The prices are staggering 98 dollars for 2 handguns (a 9mm and a .45) 50 rounds of each or in other shooting ranges it is about 10 dollars the rental of the weapon plus 14-18 dollars for the 50 cartridges. Avoid this establishment if you are not a member and instead direct you towards more "tourist" ranges like the "los angeles shooting club." Highlight of the show he forgets to give us our 2 IDs so let's turn around 25 km to Pick them up. The only good thing is the parking lot. You know every good stay in Los Angeles.

Le pire shooting range de los Angeles et sûrement de tout les états-unis. J'ai tirer dans la plupart des états américain mais je n'ai jamais était autant deçu. Premièrement aucune informations sur les prix, nous étions 2 mais ne pouvons avoir qu'une arme et qu'une ligne donc attendre chacun son tour ,autrement dit nul. Un choix vraiment médiocre d'arme de poing et encore pire de fusil semi automatique . Les prix sont ahurisants 98 dollars pour 2 armes de poing (un 9mm et un .45) 50 cartouche de chaque ou dans d'autres shooting range c'est environ 10 dollars la location de l'arme plus 14-18 dollars pour les 50 cartouches . Fuyez cet établissement si vous n'y êtes pas membre et diriger vous plutôt vers des range plus "touristique' comme le "los angeles shooting club" . Clou du spectacle il oublie de nous rendre nos 2 ID donc faisons demi tour de 25 km pour les récupérer . Seul bon point, le parking. Voilà vous savez tout bon séjour à los Angeles.<//review>

We passed a lovely experience there with fine food and  an experienced crew and a distinguished  chef. We put this place in our phone list  and we will no doubt come back very soon.

Disappointing. Lived by this place for many years and finally gave it a shot. Everything was ho hum to bleh. The baked muscles were fishy and for our last roll we were served what I've uploaded in my photo. It's like they just gave up. Our spicy salmon roll never came out, but we were done at that point and had the waiter cancel the order. Should of known when the table next to us left a massive amount of uneaten good when they left. I'm sticking with Ahi across the street.< /Review>

<text>This sushi restaurant is the absolute best in the San Fernando Valley! Bar none it is the bomb dot com! The fish was very fresh,  the sushi nigiri and rolls were delicious and very artistically crafted by Japanese sushi chefs! I was very happy and full after our meal! The prices were great! $29.95 for all you can eat dinner! $19.95 for all you can eat lunch! Definitely come to Yen Sushi!!!!</text>< userid>

Another all you can eat sushi bar with TERRIBLE QUALITY sushi. They also purposely load everything up with EXTRA EXTRA RICE so you get full fast. The sushi was so bad I didnt even order a second round and went and got 5 guys next door right after.</review>

<Text>This is the best sushi I have ever had.  And compared to other places the all you can eat is the most reasonable.  I used to go to another place (who for kindness sake I won't mention the name) who started raising prices like crazy!  I know times are tough, but suddenly on top of the expensive all you can eat charge if you ordered uni  or shrimp heads -- or which you were only allowed one order -- now you had to pay an extra 2 dollars!  Forget it!  When I found Yen I found not only better quality, I found lower prices, and I could order what I wanted.  They are serious about eating everything though as they are entitled to be.  My friend and I ordered too much the first time.  We had to pay extra for what we couldn't eat!  But they were extremely kind and packed it all up for us to take home.  I learned a lesson!<//Text>< rating>

Popcorn Lobster roll, Baked salmon roll.

They don't need any explanation other than yum.

Popcorn lobster roll is with a spicy tuna roll under. Its so good. The yellow sauce they put on it is delicious too. I know its not spicy mayo but its a good sauce. Works perfect for the roll.

Baked Salmon, melts in your mouth. I like the fact that they bake it well. Its not just torched on top. It is fully cooked.

This is my sushi spot< /text>

Sushi here is fresh and delicious. The baked salmon roll is so soft and moist. It came  hot (big +). Usually if I get miso soup at other places they are way to salty. This place makes it perfect. The avocado ball has spicy tuna underneath. Very good. I like the presentation of the sushi. The salmon raw pieces were really good. Very fresh.  I think this is becoming my favorite sushi joint.< /text>

The tuna was very dark and I could smell it as soon as it was brought to my table. I ordered a second avocado roll after sending it back, and wow, there was hardly any avocado in it. Won’t be returning.< /text>

I went here two days ago while visiting a friend in the Long Beach area. Yen has several other locations, including the one near my home in Studio City.

The first thing I noticed when I got here was that this was a Korean owned franchise. Oh no. The menu consisted mainly of contemporary fancy rolls, as well as some other basic "Japanese" food that anybody can learn to cook really. Anyways, I gave the food a shot.

I ordered yellowtail, albacore, and spanish mackerel nigiri sushi. Then my friend got a soft shell crab and salmon roll. After having tried a piece of everything, I concluded that the food here is 3 stars. It's not bad sushi like Todai or Sushi Mac. It's even a tad better than Mon, which is another Korean owned sushi franchise. It's just not on the same freshness/taste level as Noshi Sushi, Sushi Gen, Yotsuya, or even Oomasa. The rolls themselves were just okay too.

Sure, the restaurant interior is nice, clean, and good for friendship outings. But if you want something great tasting, don't drive out of your way to eat here. It's not all that spectacular. I guess now I now how the Studio City location probably tastes like.</review>

< Review>
Gus was a very helpful employee and was very patient as he allowed me time to figure out what stationary I would like to buy. I felt like I asked some pretty dumb questions but he was very kind and reassured me that they weren't dumb. I asked him to pose for this photo so that I could happily send in this review. He told me he did the heart pose cuz of his deep love for this establishment. Thank you very much for your help! :)</Review>

Easy to get to, close to freeway and ample parking. Layout is nice in a spacious and well organized store. I liked the fact that multiple store employees were actively helping customers and yet all 3 of them near the entrance greeted me. In these days of too little human assistance in retail, that was very refreshing.<//Review>

I went in on Sunday and I got great help which is refreshing now a days. When I asked to speak to the manager so I could recognize what a good job Gaby was doing she said she was the manager. I would recommend this store for the friendly assistance< /review>

Some of their products are great, some can be found for cheaper prices online. They are OK, but if you know exactly what you need, consider searching for prices online. At the same time, if you are just looking, and you are not sure what is the specific item you need, you will probably find it here.< /text>

Actually I want to give this store and this company negative stars, but I don't have the option. I was given the wrong product which I went back to return later. They told me I couldn't because I had opened the package already. I had to talk so much and got so upset before they can let me return. Honestly, almost all the other businesses have had unconditional return polices for many years, and Office Depot has been so outdated not only in its return policy and its prices are so much higher than what you can find on Amazon. Office Depot, as such a business failure, your end is not far.</text>

Small for my liking, but I've always found what I needed, primarily printer ink, paper, pens and the basic office staples... No "Staples" pun intended, I'm definitely an Office Depot kind of guy.< /Text>

<Review>The staff is rude and racist. Me and my friend went to the store to ship a box. The women who looks like manager in the store tell us to pay for the tap since we use their tap twice on the bottom! ($1 per piece)Would never go there again!< /Review>< userid>

< Review>
We recently purchased a used E Class from Suzanna at Santa Rosa Mercedes Benz and it was an absolutely fantastic experience.

Even though the car was one of the least expensive ones on the lot, we were treated like valued customers buying the most expensive AMG model. The entire process from test drive to purchase was smooth and professional.

Suzanna took care of the smallest details for us, like making sure a scratch on the window tinting was fixed at their expense. Further, when you purchase through MBSR, you get loaner vehicles and free car washes. The car we bought was owned by a single owner and purchase from this dealership so we felt like we got a very good deal.

All of our post-sale follow ups have been smooth and responsive. It was a pleasure to work with Suzanna and MBSR. We would highly recommend them.< /Review>

This Dealership has the best Service Department of any car dealership in California. This is an independent family owned dealership that focuses on the customer. We have purchased 2 cars from them and they perform all of our service. The service department is reason enough to purchase a Mercedes. Prompt, efficient, thorough and safe. They are strictly following Covid Safety Guidelines keeping their customers and staff safe.. We left the dealership today feeling wonderful knowing our vehicles  were serviced properly and were cleaned to perfection after that service.<//review>

<Review>Had the AEM done on my Sprinter at a different dealer back home in SoCal. On the way up for our trip I got the dreaded 10 start count down do to a def leak. I brought it here hoping that it would be covered my Mercedes, unfortunately it wasn't.  The repair was going to be pretty expensive, and the shop that had completed the modification agreed to repair it, but I had to get it back to them. Nick let me keep the Sprinter there all week, and we got a rental from Enterprise next door.  When I picked up the van yesterday, they had reset the computer for the count down so we could get home.  When I went to pick it up, they didn't charge me a dime, not even to troubleshoot, which is unheard of these days.  I highly recommend Nick Stauer and his service department for all your needs at Mercedes-Benz of Santa Rosa.< /Review></record>

I had to give it a star but if it would have been up to me it would have been no star.
Parked in there lot, walked around for 30 minutes.  Nobody offered to help us or even acknowledge us so I took my business elsewhere. Oh, and made a great purchase elsewhere.
Thanks for nothing.</review>

The best service and such nice guys! The Parts answer service guys are patient and do a great job. Thanks for amazing service. The kids at the rental counter/cashier could use coaching up on old school customer service.  They don't make eye contact, or look you in the face when they go over your receipt. They look down and point and then go back to their conversation.< /text>

<Text>WOW!!!!!!!!! I cant say more about Suzanna Barnette and Mercedes of Santa Rosa. I bought a car sight unseen and they helped me feel comfortable and made the purchase effortless. Suzanna Barnette even helped with shipping. This is the only Mercedes dealer I will use from this point forward. Thanks a million Suzanna!!!!!</Text>< pics>

The service dept. is a group of scam artists 100% confirmed.  Not only did they tell me I needed repairs in the range of $2K+ they also kept my high end mercedes sports car over the weekend and drove it.  They put 80 miles on it and claimed it was a "road test".   I immediately went to a trusted local independent shop that informed me I needed 220$ in repairs and that this particular dealer is well known for their indiscretions.  You've been warned.</Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Today I had to get 2 vehicles serviced. Overall, my experience was good.

Both of the service representatives that I worked with were great. I was provided with a loaner to get back and forth to my home.

My only complaint is with the parts my vehicle needed. I paid a lot for the vehicle and had expected longer lasting parts. I'm a bit frustrated about that.

Happy with my repairs. Happy with my service reps.

USB charging stations in the waiting area would be a good thing.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808448283223424f:0xbd40a9615f2e027</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<date>1515971502683</date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>The team at Mercedes is superb. From Nick and David in the service department to Suzanna in sales. In April, Suzanna and I met to discuss my lease coming to an end and getting into a new car. She was friendly, knowledgeable and fun to work with. She continued to follow-up with me and we ended up ordering a new car. During the process, she kept me in the loop and when my car arrived, she took photos of it and sent it to me right away since I couldn't make it in that day. When I walked in, she had a big red bow (like you see on TV) and the entire staff welcomed me. They spent a great deal of with me making sure I knew how to work all the features of the car. Suzanna is the best sales representative and I highly recommend seeing her. The team at Mercedes Santa Rosa is one of a kind. Even after the sale was finished, she texted me a week later to see how I was doing and how the car is! Now that's stellar service!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>The service department here is awesome. My service advisor, Deric, has been nothing but helpful and friendly. My brand new A220 started having an engine issue a month in and one of my Pirelli tires bubbled out within that time. Deric made the entire process go without a hitch, calmed my anxieties about my tire, and went above and beyond to help me out. He sent me a Lyft for when I needed to go to work or home when my car was in service - pretty awesome perk! I also got a sweet ride as a rental when my car needed to be in service for longer than a day. I got a tire replacement within two days - even though nobody had my specific tire in stock on this side of the country. Deric overnighted the tire and got the job done and my car back to me quickly. The service department here definitely adds to my brand affinity.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

ASK FOR RICK! ASK FOR RICK! ASK FOR RICK!  Rick is the best sales person I have ever met.  He took the time to go over all functions of the s550.  I can't imagine going to anyone else.  He had everything prepared prior to my arrival.  Hassle Free deal.  You can tell upper management supports his sales.  What a quick transaction with such focus on customer satisfaction.  Had an amazing experience!</review>

I had such an exceptional experience buying my car from this dealership.  Suzanna Barnette is really amazing and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and more from the dealership.  She is a true car enthusiast who has a thorough understanding about each of the cars and she takes great pride in doing a great job for your benefit.  I would highly recommend this dealership because, each step of the way, they go above and beyond to ensure that you are 100% happy.< /review>

Sheila Hampton is the one and only Sales Representative to go to at MB Santa Rosa! She takes pride in everything she does, will go to any length to find you the vehicle of your dreams, and is passionate about Her work. Sheila is by far the main reason why I keep coming back, and have now leased my third vehicle. Professional, caring, fun, and an all around great person!< /Review>

I want to start out by saying I don't write reviews, but our time at the Mercedes Santa Rosa dealership was really great. We were in the market for a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle so we stopped by the dealership to look at the inventory.  We were greeted by Steven Zuckor who patiently supported our "all over the map" investigation of the lot.  Honestly, I never imagined a car buying experience could be this good.  When we landed on the "one" it was, without a doubt, the least amount of haggling I've ever done and walked away happy.  Thank you Mercedes Santa Rosa & Steven, you've made customers for life!< /review>

<review>I bought a pre-owned Audi from Rick at Smothers European Mercedes.  Hands down the easiest and best car buying experience I've ever had.  The car had been set aside for me when I arrived and I was able to test drive it right away.  In spite of Rick being a salesman for Mercedes he quickly researched all the questions I had about the car.  Purchase paperwork was quick and easy - Erin secured excellent financing for me with no money down.  My new car was delivered to me free of charge the following morning in San Francisco, and it had a full tank of gas and had been fully detailed.  In spite of the distance to Santa Rosa I will definitely go back to Smothers when it's time for a new car.  Thanks to Rick and Erin.< /review>< Pics>

Generally we purchase from Marin or SF but stopping by Santa Rosa MB was a pleasure! We worked with Suzanna Barnett and the process was seamless. Just remember when purchasing these (computer cars) there are a few warrantys they will offer you! With all the road hazards in Sonoma County, a windshield warranty is a good idea! Call Suzanna for your new buy or lease today!<//Text>

<Text>I always take my MB Sprinter van to Mercedes dealers for maintenance because I have always received excellent service:  top notch parts, knowledgeable mechanics who stand behind their work, and extraordinary customer service.  This has proven to be accurate for 3 out of the last 4 MB dealers I have visited UNTIL I visited MB Santa Rosa.

I arrived on time for my appointment to investigate a steering vibration and Matt checked me in.  He was pleasant enough and we had a quick discussion of the symptoms my van was experiencing.  I retired to the lounge and prepared to wait for an hour or so.  About 4 hours later I finally heard from Matt that the mechanic didn't find any mechanical problems with the steering and that this vibration issue was caused by my overly worn tires.  I was surprised to hear this because (a) my tires were not yet worn down to the wear bar, (b) the vibration didn't feel like a tire issue to me, and (c) it took 4 hours to figure this out?.  But this was a Mercedes mechanic, the best in the business, so I trusted them.  Matt offered to sell me a set of 4 tires but the order wouldn't arrive for four days.  I declined because I was under a deadline to continue my drive south to Mexico and couldn't wait around that long.

My van was driven back around front and I was also disappointed to see that it had not been washed.  The three other dealers I have visited all washed my van without being asked, but apparently this isn't offered at Santa Rosa.  I paid the service charge (I guess being told your tires are slightly worn is considered service) and hit the road.  At least if my van had been washed I would have felt like I got a little something for my money.

I called a few shops along my route but none of them had the tires in stock.  Since Matt told me it was just a tire problem and not a mechanical problem, it didn't seem serious so I decided to drive to Mexico and get new tires on the return trip.

On the drive back north I noticed the vibration worsening so I took my van to Mercedes Benz of Van Nuys.  Within about two minutes of arriving, the Service Consultant and a mechanic pinpointed the cause of my problem.  It was not the tires, it was a loose steering linkage located under the hood.  They explained to me how dangerous it was because I could have lost steering at any moment when the bolt loosened all the way out.   They fixed the problem in about 1 hour, happily washed my van for me at no additional charge, and they said it was fine to keep the same tires.  I paid for the service, and the service consultant suggested I contact MB Santa Rosa and ask them to refund their service charge since they obviously missed the problem; a potentially life-threatening problem.

A few days later I called Matt at Santa Rosa, explained the situation, and he said he would talk to his boss and get back to me the next day.  Two days later I still hadn't heard back from Matt so I left a voicemail.  Another two days later, after no response, I left another voicemail for Matt.  I suppose he was hoping I would just give up and go away.  After 9 days and 4 calls to Matt with no response, I changed tactics and got a hold of Lisa in service who seemed genuinely interested in helping me.

Sure enough, later that day I finally got a call back from Matt and he regretted to inform me that since they actually provided me with a service (suggesting I buy new tires) the service charge would not be refunded.  I protested saying they misdiagnosed the problem; it had nothing to do with the tires, in fact they were still on the van and it was driving perfectly now!  Matt responded that doctors misdiagnose patients all the time but they still get paid, so they would NOT refund me.  I have never experienced such blatantly unethical behavior from any mechanic anywhere, and especially not from a Mercedes dealer.

So, unless you enjoy paying for faulty service that could potentially kill you, and terrible customer service that doesn't return your calls, take your business elsewhere.<//Text>< user_name>

I travel extensively for photography in an Itasca Navion RV, which is built over a Mercedes cab and power train. The beautiful little 3 liter turbo Diesel needs regular service every 10,000 miles, which is about twice a year for me.

Only select Mercedes shops are certified to service Sprinters. San Francisco is closer to me but not fun to navigate in a class C RV, even one as nimble as the Navion. So I choose to drive most of an hour to Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa.

And I"m very happy doing so. My service writer is available promptly in a spotless, comfortable office with all my service history on the computer. I'm at ease waiting two or three hours in their spacious guest area or one of several work guest cubicles. With WiFi, self-serve esporsso drinks, and fresh cookies, the time goes by quickly, often in conversation with other Mercedes owners.

When I get the call that my vehicle if ready, it's ready! Not almost done or with some service items overlooked. That includes major repairs done under a third party extended warranty. I have always been completely satisfied with the work done by Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa and will continue to take my vehicle there as long as I own it.

Great people, great service, great place.< /Text>

I am from out of town and was in Santa Rosa to visit a friend when my C-Class started having some issues. I brought my car in without an appointment as an emergency and the service team directed me to Deric. Deric was very professional and listened to my concerns and without any time to waste took my car and hooked me up with a loaner later that day. I was kept updated with the repair process and any changes to schedule was reported to me in time. I finally got my car all fixed up and ready to go in less than 36 hours. I strongly recommend this dealership for service. All other staff including the technician and cashiers were also highly professional and kind.</review>

Smothers Mercedes employee's are friendly and also helpful.  This dealership values every single one of his customers.  What dealership encourages it's customers to come in for a complimentary car wash?

I know of no other dealership that offers this level of sevice in Santa Rosa and belieces, "it makes no sense to dissatify a customer."

Smothers Mercedes goes above and beyond when it comes to service and customer satisfaction.

Thank you Smothers Mercedes for being in Santa Rosa.</Review>

Had a very smooth and enjoyable car buying experience at Santa Rosa Mercedes last week, want to say thanks to both Suzanna Barnette in sales and Erin Mahre, finance manager!
Not our first new car purchase by far, so we have been around enough to know a great salesperson when we meet her!   Suzanna was pleasant,  no pressure, superbly knowledgeable of all the workings of the CPO E-Class we purchased & even stayed over an hour late to complete the walkthrough, setup and delivery! (And yes.. a just washed, dried and sparkling beautiful diamond silver E-350 with a full tank!)
And Erin in finance was simply wonderful to work with too!  Her years of knowledge and experience shows as she was able to fully explain all the documents  and yet quickly complete her work, even though she too was staying past closing, at the end of a long day!   She made the paperwork experience easy with her happy friendly demeanor and expertise!
I’m guessing  that the wonderful treatment we received last week,  comes from the CEO on down, encouraging their employees to create an environment that has the customer actually feeling good about the car buying experience!  How about that!
This is our first Mercedes purchase and I suspect it won’t be our last.  This was hands down the easiest, most enjoyable, car buying experience we have had in the last 20 years!  Thank you to Santa Rosa Mercedes!<//Text>

Wow, that was a great experience. Suzanna Barnette is truly awesome. We hit it off our first meeting, and by my second visit I made my decision. Who knew leasing a new car could be so much fun? I got a great car with truly agreeable lease terms. The whole process was seamless, and enjoyable. My choice of car was delivered in the showroom because it was raining (thoughtful, right?), and spotlessly perfect in every way. Erin Mahre is a true professional with paperwork. She had me signed, quick and easy. I could't possibly be more pleased. Best of all, I love my new MB. I'm a busy realtor, so I especially appreciate a flawless transaction. Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa is A1!< /review>

Talk about hassle-free service! Had a great car buying experience with Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa. This was the first Mercedes purchase I or anyone in my family has made. We've only owned Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the past. Suzanna Barnette was the sales consultant who helped me through my car search and graciously answered any questions I had. From the initial ordering date, through the tracking updates, inquiries, and vehicle spec explanations, Suzanna was always available to answer questions or got answers from her associates quickly to make sure I felt comfortable with my purchase and experience. This is what a great car buying experience should be! I love my GLC300 4Matic and look forward to my continued relationship with MB of SR.< /review>

<Text>First I would like to say I am completely satisfied and truly happy with how my experience has been with Tesla especially after watching some of the horror stories online. I have been shopping for a new car for two years now and could not find anything I liked, until I came to tesla that is. It truly is like no vehicle I have ever driven. The experience for me was seamless, safe and exciting and there's not one thing I would have changed about it.

I would like to call out one Advisor at Tesla for making this process extremely easy and pleasant, Andrew N. at the  Westfield Topanga Mall sales store. When I first met Andrew in 2020 he was extremely patient and thorough explaining what exactly the ‘Tesla lifestyle’ is, even with me having no prior knowledge of Tesla besides they are an electric car manufacturer. Andrew went over the benefits and showed me the ins and outs of the car safely during the pandemic. Here I am in the end of march 2021 the day before delivery day wanting to thank him for all his hard work, in getting me the car when I needed it, checking in, and especially answering all my questions even if it was his day off. Update Delivery day went incredibly smooth. Car was in perfect condition and staff made it easy and a breezy experience.

If you are thinking of Buying a tesla and in the Northern Los Angeles area go see Andrew.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Came in to take a look at a Model 3 a few weeks ago, doing some window shopping before my lease is up next year. Met with Gabe Gomez one of the sales specialists on staff. Gabe was incredibly friendly, and extremely knowledgeable on the product. He assured me he owned a similar model himself, which is something you don't see with most car dealerships.

I informed Gabe I was just window shopping, never once did he try to push me into a sale, or make me feel like I had to buy today. He did however let me take the model 3 for a drive, and showed me some cool tricks I'd be able to do when I purchase. If you're like me you've been trained to be fearful of ever setting foot in a dealership, Elon and Tesla really are changing the game on how we buy cars. If you go to this shop and ask for Gabe I promise you'll be in good hands!

Update: Came back today, ran into Gabe, he instantly remembered me, which made me feel especially appreciated as a potential customer! Looking forward to working with Gabe in the near future, also looking forward to not dealing with gas stations ever again!</Review>< Pictures>

Man where do I start. I came to visit my family in Los Angeles from Houston and stopped by Topanga Mall. I noticed there was a Tesla showroom. I stopped by to get to better know the Model 3's infotainment unit and features, since I got a delivery happening at end of month in Houston. The rep Jordan was the first to greet me promptly. We sat inside of a Model 3 named the silver bullet and he gave me detailed explanations for each and every question I threw at him. He taught me how to read the travel efficiency, charging schedules and autopilot. He broke down how autopilot that comes standard is broken down into traffic aware and auto steer. Jordan made the store experience memorable. I highly recommend anyone who needs a test drive or has questions to request for him!<//Review>

Nice modern looking Tesla store with beautiful S3X display cars. I test drove a Model 3, loved it and bought one a few months later. Employees were friendly and don't pressure you at all. I thought my Prius was the greatest car of all time but turns out I was wrong.< /Text>

Every time I'm in the mall I just stop in and check out the Model S they have on display there. All of the workers are very nice--they don't work on commission, so there's no pressure to buy. Cool place.<//review>

<text>What an exceptional experience!  Working at different time with almost all team members (I studied this car for 18 month and had limitless questions), the professionalism, knowledge and unbridled enthusiasm was a pleasure to see.

Their GM Michael Sagaria has certainly taught by example, his understanding and customer focus made this a truly extraordinary purchase experience!!!</text>< userid>

This dealership is an utter joke. The most unprofessional group I have ever encountered. I wish I could give them less than one star. They lied to me about the deposit and then after I stopped the payment with the credit card company they had some clown call me and say if I would commit to a solar system on my home they would refund the $2500 deposit. After I told him how insulting he was he refused to give me his name. I proceeded to call back and speak with Roman the assistant manager who would not reveal the clowns name. The sales rep Oliver Frankcom promised me he would return my deposit when I first took the test drive. The car was available at the time I was looking at it and there were no custom upgrades so they had no reason to keep my deposit. After canceling the charge with my bank Oliver Frankcom was spineless and refused to return my call. Upon trying to contact Tesla’s corporate office they pulled the same tripe that they were an internet company and my only option was to send an email or go onto their chat. As I said a complete joke. At first I disregarded the online reviews that said after they get your money the customer service falls of a cliff. It’s true. If you really want a Tesla I highly recommend you go to another dealership.</text>

Came here to look at the cars with my husband and son. They completely ignored us and only seemed to help the people they thought would be worth there time. My husband finally was able to talk to someone and they tried to make things right but by then I already had a sour taste in my mouth. I was bummed because we really were wanting a Tesla but after this I just don't think I want to spend money on a brand that has people working for them who think it's ok to profile!< /review>

Scheduled a test drive. When we got there, we were 5 min late and they wouldnt let us drive it saying "We dont have any available". Yes they did, we parked next to the lot they hold them at, it was full. The girl who was going to take us out went home. Horrible.< /text>

Not sure why this place has such low stars. For me it easy to pay and always had great experience taking to the court house over the phone.</Review>

<review>This place is a joke I went to go and try to get information on a ticket that I got place was closed yet on the paper that I got it says open. You see staff go in and out yet no one knows how to help you. Oh and don't try calling you'll be on hold for 10 mins with no answer they ask you to leave your name number email address and they'll get back to you but wait it's full so better stay on and hope you get lucky.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I just LOVE paying 12% state tax and having horrible public service, unusable schools, and homeless everywhere. Looks like they are putting all that money to great use. Also it was a little late so had to pay a $300 fine. They are really good at collecting our money. Not so great with the service part.</Text>< Response>

I've been harassed by these people constantly sending me mail saying I have a traffic ticket (speeding ticket) which I got in 2017. I've tried to pay it for over 2 years and everytime I go "it's not in the system" so they just tell me to go home. Its 2020 and now they finally filed this ticket doubling my insurance. During this pandemic when I barley have money I have tried to call and they hang up. I try to go in person and they are closed with no notice. During a time in crisis when I need the money most they screw me over when I tried to be a man and pay for my mistakes in the past and they would not let me pay. Now they file this ticket and dont even give me a chance to pay for it or fix it.The santa clara county is a joke and doesn't care about its citizens.</text>

THE WORST! I got a simple traffic fine in court. Sheriff told me I can make payments online. 3 days before my deadline I went to pay online and that turned out to be a lie!! I called the court and their automated system says they simply can't take a phone call at the moment. This sublet of a justice system is a joke!!! I work 630am-300pm all weekdays!!!<//review>

My friend got a ticket for a broken light. Four months later they sent the paperwork (1 month after their own deadline when you are supposed to pay the fine...).They say you can mail in the fine for a correctable violation but they dont give you the address so you have to go to court and wait in line for two hours.......oh well its a government monopoly what can you do?< /review>

I called to ask for help and information on alternatives for available extentions, and the lady who answered the phone and didn't identify herself, started to get short and grew an attitude with me very quickly (and I'm being very nice to word it this way). I said ok thank you and hung up very quickly. I was very polite and courteous did nothing to deserve to be treated as such.</review>

I live too far to be coming down to deal with this bs. I don’t even know how to resolve the issue at this point.<//review></record>

<review>Most people don't want to come here. They have to deal with an unpleasant ticket they received from a police officer. They are often confused and angry. It's sad how they take it out on the staff. It's a small office and short staffed. They do the best they can. They don't  have the authority to dismiss the ticket or change it. Be prepared with a book and headphones. Mondays are the worst day to go. You will have to go through a metal detector.If at all possible try the website before you go there. Have your case number and ticket to make things easier. For website Google Santa Clara County Superior Court. They even have your case info on line and a lot of your questions may be answered  instead of going in person.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The wait time is a lot shorter then the 2 hours I remember from years ago. However, if you have questions about anything, if you can't find it online, go in to the courthouse. They have no staff available to answer phones due to budget cuts, even if you are checking your court date. Its better to go in. They have a drop box outside that is always available and they empty it every weekday morning, I think, when they open. If you get to a window and you have something left incomplete, if you can fix it there, they give you a pass to jump to the front of the line as long as you can complete it that day before closing. If you are still in line at 3 PM, they will keep working until all the people in line have been seen, however they lock the doors at 3 PM so you have to arrive before then. There are also metal detecors you have to walk through and an b-day machine for purses. No weapons, drugs, alcohol, even pocket knives are allowed and for somethings the officers will set aside for you to retrieve before you leave. Same process like with any other courthouse. They don't make copies for you and there is no copier or printer available so come prepared. They payment methods are also limited. I think cash and check are preferred but don't quote me on that. Again, DON'T TRY CALLING ON THE PHONE! YOU WON'T GET THROUGH! And if you have a choice, don't go in on Monday. I was told that is one of the busiest days for them and results in long wait times. I think I went in on a Tuesday or Wednesday and they had a good amount of Windows open and the line was moving pretty quick. Even though when I arrived I had to stand all the way at the back door of the building. I was seen in way under an hour, probably about 30 minutes give or take.<//Review>

Which wouldn't be that bad except I live AN HOUR away. I asked if I could pay over the phone or online and she told me no. This place is horrible.

<Text>Their online traffic payments are not currently working, so they ask you to call a number they provide to make payments. Yet that does not work either! it just tells you a website of theirs to visit to pay, yet that page just asks you to call the same number and it's alike a broken system, a never ending loop where you can't pay. I too am late 1 day now and without the online payments working, nor the phone line, I guess they just expect me (and everyone else) to go to their location which I've been seeing it can take up to 2 hours!! I'd have to miss work just to go pay them, yet by missing work I'm losing even more money!! What is going on over there?! They need to get their act together!!<//Text><username>NeverGo FullJeff<//username>< resp>

Stood in line for over 45 minutes. No chairs, no water. Not enough clerks. If you can avoid coming here, I suggest that you do. It only takes a couple of minutes to pay a ticket but you could spend over an hour trying to get it done.<//text>

<review>Usually it's a 45 minute line here. They also lost my check that I put in their dropbox. If you'd like to pay online, they charge a large fee (or, better yet, for some citations they don't take online payments so you have to do it in person). You'll get conflicting information from clerks as well which makes the whole process cruel/unusual< /review>< Rate>

I've never had the urge to sign into an account to make a review until now. I used their phone service to get the due dates for my traffic school completion and she reassured me it was May 1. I called again to get the letter of understanding on April 21, and they told me I had already missed my completion day and that I would have to pay a $24 extension fee. Which wouldn't be that bad except I live AN HOUR away. I asked if I could pay over the phone or online and she told me no. This place is horrible. Scamming you for your money in every single way possible.</review>

Took the morning off to go pay a fix it ticket. Turns out the courthouse is closed for Abraham Lincoln's birthday, and the only way to find that out is to call and navigate a ten-layers-deep phone menu to the exact right place where they'll tell you all of the federal holidays at this location in chronological order.<//Review>

< Review>
I'm a commercial truck driver, I safely went thru a yellow/red light (I had 2 trailers loaded,  I could not safely stop without creating a hazard or jacknifing one of my trailers) the CHP saw me as did I. He pulled me over and told me what I already knew I did, I explained to him the outcome of me slamming on the brakes on a 70,000 lb truck and trailers. He didn't care (he simply said, you're a commercial driver, you should know best). I can't do traffic school because I was driving a commercial vehicle. My fine was $490 plus the stupid $6.45 fee they charge, not to mention the several calls I made to try and get an extension and waiting a combined total of 5 hours on the phone to speak to someone, eventually  "Denise" which by the way was very professional and polite....helped me out. Now I'm short almost $500, my insurance will probably go up, DMV record with points. Just a bad experience, the CHP could've gave me a warning due to the nature of the incident. But I guess they have to meet their quota.<//Review>

Avoid window 10. She telling that the place is cash only, but it’s only her window.
Also, she didn’t turn on traffic school option in online payments, so I had to visit this place twice. Going to file a complaint.
Also, there is an ATM to the left from entrance.<//text>

Leave a voicemail to speak with a clerk? Seriously?? Is this a courthouse? I am trying to ask on a citation that is said to have been given in May, yet I haven't had a car since September 2016. And I dont even live in Santa Clara.
DMV says they have no info on it, to call courthouse, courthouse says leave a message, I do and nobody responds. Maybe cause there's 50,000 voicemail ahead of mine???!!!! Uuuuuugh!<//text>

phone staff unbelievable, reluctant to admit she was in fact traffic court, or that it was possible to look me up by name; then told me repeatedly that the citation I had already made three payments on did not appear in the system. When pressed did find me, after misspelling my name several times, then told me I was making payments and needed to make them to a credit agency. I repeated that all I wanted was the stinking citation number and had made all prior payments in person at the courthouse so I did not see why matters should be any different for the final payment on an ancient ticket that had been dormant.....all this after a 40-minute wait. The system won't let me give no stars but I would if I could< /Text>

The phone number literally does not function (if you try to talk to a clerk, you get a message "this extension has been disabled").  Despite my case # not searchable on the site (how can I address a case which is not entered into the system?), I received past due notice.

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>My 13yo dog needed dental work, and the estimate at the place here in SF was $2k.  A friend at the dog park told me about this place.  5 stars for Dr. Goldfarb, and 5 stars for his staff.  In the end, I saved 40%.  My only complaint is that it took me 10 years to find this place.  VERY accessible by public trans if you don't have a car.<//Text>< Pics>

Very attentive animal lovers here- and Dr. J has a thorough process of explaining options. We've had cat tooth extractions, car impact-injury recovery support, and cancer-related surgery done with All Care. I have no doubts about quality of care. ❤</Text>

<Review>Dr. Grossbard truly loves animals and genuinely cares for them!
He is honest and takes his time to thoroughly explain everything we need to know regarding our pet.
I originally visited this clinic ten years ago. He was my favorite veterinarian back then, unfortunately I moved away pushing us to search for a new veterinarian, but no one seemed nearly as genuine, warm, and skillful as him.
When I moved back we decided to return to Allcare and we did not regret it! I am consistently surprised with the followup calls after visits and how quickly he responds to messages. The staff are friendly and respectful, and loving to animals.

My daughter lives in the city and she has made Allcare her primary place for her two aussies the last 3 years and is very satisfied with his care and work ethic as well!

Thank you Dr. G and staff for making our family feel welcome!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdSC8TJLk0VgMZVQYup4HsvZfxsO2XutfXJ9h0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM66PQ72HB4MgLPIKb69NX2ChuR1rSWiFddmKFS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

I called looking for bird beak trimming and spoke to Susan. Excellent customer service, although they did not offer the service I was looking for, she was able to refer me to three other local vet shops and did have the service and she was able to give me all their contact info as well! If this is the service I received on the phone and not as a customer, I can only imagine the service they would provide for a customer!<//Text>

Dr. Grossbard is amazing with animals. Over the years, their caring staff steered me to organic treatments, gentle kitty training tools and foods that are best for my particular breed (orange tabbies). I trust them implicitly.< /text>

<Text>This vet practice has consistently provided excellent, experienced and highly professional care of our pets. They are quick to respond and work hard to be flexible for appointments as neeeded. But equally important, everyone there  demonstrates compassion and genuine concern for the well-being and good outcomes for the animals they care for. That is really important because our pets are truly members of our family! We have pet rats, and this vet practice is very skilled with handling and caring for our ratties. We've had a few surgeries for them, and in every case the procedures and experience was 100% great. We love AllCare and would recommend them wholeheartedly.<//Text>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We are happy to have chosen this Vet Hospital since first having our dog. It all started with the search for having her spayed and we came across Allcare, who at the time was accepting a voucher given to us by the SM county. That experience could not have gone any smoother and we have been coming here ever since. The front desk here is always smiling and happy to assist everyone who walks in. Nurses are gentle and helpful. Dr. G is very knowledgeable, caring and thorough with any questions that come up. Making appointments is easy and requesting paperwork or shot certificates is always a quick turnaround. Koko Brown is happy, healthy and gets the best treatment here.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>I drive from San Francisco to see Dr. Jeremy.  Many years ago my former vet did not know why my dog was losing her fur, possibly allergy's.  I decided to find another vet that new about allergy's in pets.  I found All Care Veterinary,  with some tests he found what she was allergic to and together he and I decided to put her on RX pills.  She now has fur and her allergy's are under control!  Could not be happier with Dr. Jeremy!</Text>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I absolutely loved my experience here. I have two rabbits, one is an elder and one is still young. I found All Care looking for a place with less expensive rates for exotic pets. Oceana costs 75 per bunny per visit (even if nothing is wrong and they just look at them) and as a working student, it's not ideal. All Care has much more reasonable prices; a two thirds of what I pay for Oceana.

The staff is great! Everybody is so friendly and welcoming. When I first called, they were very helpful in helping me find the prices and procedures. Dr. Jeremy is absolutely wonderful as well. Other vets felt very distant but Jeremy feels very personal and he really cares for your pets. He considered my pets and wants to make sure they are the most comfortable.

There is only one doctor since it is a small practice, so when planning for an appointment, think about it being 3 or 4 weeks later.

I am definitely coming back here! A great experience and I highly recommend.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Dr. Grossbard is a true professional who is honest, sharp, and realistic about your pet's needs. He is the only vet I've ever trusted to not gouge me on things my cat doesn't need.

<user_name>Derek Goodwin<//user_name><date>1357423315619<//date><rate>2<//rate><review>I took a pet rat here and was not at all pleased with the visit.  When handling my rat the vet simply forced him into whatever position he needed.  My previous vet was much more gentle and actually took a moment to let my rat get acclimatized to him.

Worse though, the vet said his teeth were too long and needed to be trimmed.  I asked him how the procedure worked and he described it as not too different from trimming one's nails, just slip a tool around the teeth and snip.  When they brought my rat back from this supposedly quick and simple procedure he was bleeding profusely from the mouth, which the vet dismissed as not a big deal.  The vet hadn't mentioned any possibility of bleeding when I'd asked him about the procedure, which honestly makes me think they just messed it up.

Finally, it was more expensive than my previous vet, for a similar visit (both were for respiratory problems).  Probably because my previous vet didn't perform this dubious teeth cutting procedure, so essentially I paid extra to put my pet through additional pain and stress.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

So my first experiences here were good. I got a dog vaccinated and examined, a cat vaccinated and spayed,  another kitten that I fostered examined, and finally our own kitten examined (the vet at that time was really wierd) . Personally I loved Dr. G.  Today I got our kitten neutered and feel ripped off. Brought in a coupon for a $30 neuter. Opted for, what I was told, the pain meds at $59 and $18 for antibiotics. My hubby loves his kitten so I went for it. Picked him up and brought him home. Realized they didn't give me the meds. So I called and went back for them. And to my wonderful (not) surprise, they tell me that the antibiotics were not necessary. But the $59 is not refundable because it was part of a package to cover the I.v., fluids, and catheter. Wait, how is that not part of the neuter cost at $30? And if it wasnt, shouldnt they have told me that this a.m.?  And because it wasn't the girl who ran the front desk when I dropped him off,  the girl Wouldn't help me. After years of decent service, I will never ever go back. $59 is a lot of money for us, so I feel kind of ripped off now that I dont even have the pain meds I opted for. Unfortunate situation, be aware.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Ate here for the first time on a Sunday between lunch and dinner. Place wasn't packed, felt casual, and the service was super fast. Spring roll (shrimp & pork) appetizer was brought out a minute after we placed our order. They waited for us to almost finish before they brought our medium bowls of pho. Broth is good, plenty of meat too. Definitely want to come back to try their pork vermicelli and banh mi, among other things.< /Text>< pics>

Delicious food, fast service, and affordable prices. We were looking for a quick bowl of noodles recently, and found this place to be exactly what we needed. I had the banh mi (sandwich), and others had soup. All the ingredients were very fresh.< /Review>

I came for the Pho and wasn't disappointed. I've been here a handful of times now and the broth seems to continuously improve. It's a casual eat, decor is simple, food is good.</text>

Can't say enough good things about our experience here. Delicious food, served quickly, at an affordable pricing. The waitstaff was not only attentive but also greeted us warmly when we first entered the restaurant. I can't remember the last time we were welcomed so warmly. The owner introduced himself to us and somehow knew it was our first time. He recommended some dishes and did not disappoint. Can't wait to return</text>

Salinas only had one Vietnamese restaurant and it wasn’t all that good, and then God listened to my prayers! And Saigon Noodles opened! At first I thought it was never going to open! They had the coming soon sign for ever!

Then one day I passed by and it was open! Great beautiful people working there, met the owners who happened to be wonderful. This restaurant is just like the ones in San Jose! Really great tasting food!

I am a pho enthusiast! I love it from the first time I ever tried it more than 30 years ago, you get a huge plate full of noodles with mystery meats (I had no idea what they were at the time, now I know) and it all tastes great! They have a seafood pho! It’s fantastic one of my favorites!

This is a must! You have to try the avocado smoothie! By itself is really good but they also add this thing called buba (!?!?) is like little bubbles of culinary heaven, they have the dark ones and the white ones, they are all great!

It is family owned, be nice to them, be patient, they do tend to get busy and you will be treated like royalty! From the cook in the back the person collecting the dishes to the wait staff, they are all fantastic and friendly and determined to make sure that you have an incredible experience.</text>

Their food is good but their veggie pho is under the **vegetarian** section on their menu, yet the broth is made from chicken. Completely misleading to vegans.</text>

<text>Good Pho spot .. quick fast service, large bowls that are filling. I usually get the number #1 medium size. That bowl is large and filled with a good amount of meat, beef balls, and tripe. Enough meat for every bite of noodles.

There is a 15 dollar minimum if your paying with plastic so I would suggest bringing cash if your eating alone or just order more if your a beast.

Almost 4 stars in my book.</text>< pics>

We eat here at least 2-3 times a month. #7 pho ga chicken noodle soup is delicious. We drive 45 minutes from Pacific Grove to Salinas because it’s so good.  Other favorites are the ox tail noodle soup, the grilled beef with rice (teriyaki sauce), the thin sliced beef pho and their spring rolls. When you go you should also try the mango smoothies and Thai iced tea . We have tried several other Vietnamese restaurants on the Central Coast but stopped looking once we tasted their delicious food.<//Text>

I went there because I was washing next door. The service was basically non existant.  When I did get service the food was brought to me and basically thrown on table. The food was good but I wouldn't go back .<//Review>

The receptionist guy was terribly DUMB and had NO customer service at all whatsoever. I would never want to turn my my docs to this Consulate. They need to get rid of this Virus there and put someone who is patient and smart enough to understand people’s issues<//Review>

I needed an entry permit for my 4 years old . The guy at the window was awesome. He was great in responding to people’s questions. He even rushed and finished my work quicker when I told him we have a flight to catch. I asked for his name, so I could use it in this review, but he said it is against the police. It was a completely different experience than what I had in 2015 when I visited the consulate for the first time. Thank you!</text>

I needed help with the a Birth Certificate. The gentleman was very helpful over the phone for providing all the detailed information. His willingness to listen to your questions and providing you detailed information is amazing. I am so thrilled to see such a customer service. Thank you so much.</review>

<Text>The waiting room was very warm with no cooling facilities.  Unfortunately, you never imagined that you were inside a country agency in Angels, where millions of dollars were spent just for an embassy wall, but the facilities of General Cancel are not as big as a Kabul teahouse.  Unfortunately, due to the control of the papers, I waited for two and a half hours for him to come and sign the documents.  It is quite embarrassing for the country's representative to receive its own people in this way.< /Text>< Response>

I just have 2 questions?
I downloaded the fingerprint form from their website. Police station doesn't do fingerprint anymore.
I took the form to a notary puplic, they don't notarize my fingerprint either.
1- Do I need send the fingerprint form without notarized stamped or what?
2- Does the Afghan consulate in Los Angeles extend passport or not?

Great Consulate..just a bit hard to find.

The services were quick and easy, and the staff was very friendly. The Afghan lady who does most of the work it seems was very efficient and to the point. Thanks for that! ډیره مننه

The phone response is a bit slow, but they did respond eventually. One could try routing to them through the Afghan Embassy in Washington which I Did.

Overall, great and quick experience!

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>The customer service is even worse than Afghanistan. They put on their website that they don’t accept walk-ins, but when I called numerous times and left several voice messages no one returned my calls. They probably make it harder for customers to provide an opportunity for some money under the table, just like Afghanistan.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Worse Consulate ever Seen! Their services are fully down, you can not contact them, they only have a reception phone number in their contact and that always transfer your call to voice mail, once you leave a voice mail will never hear back from them. really disappointed from their services in such technical and advance word.< /Review>

The employees in this consulate are very unprofessional and uneducated, they are all fraudulent people.
They've asked me to send my son's original birth certificate by mail for the permit to travel, but they lost my son's original birth certificate. They are irresponsible & they sell your identification to illegal aliens.< /review>

<Review>I have mixed feelings about the place. Customer service staff are polite with low energy and void of any desire to be helpful or to get things done in a hurry. Good luck getting any helpful information or guidance from them. They have no motivation, risk or reward to provide better or efficient service. It's like going to DMV and expecting customer service.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCF9xogVVg5hMPV8fWQz8KP0R81PRZnNNlJcy0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAV4Zh3ABL_rpXBSjUX_yibFV8IOmCp3bBxHSG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM34THrlniiXQ4PcHgvTN7vRAvgZ7zsw7AtttN5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2b9568ea27e5d:0x70191993f593ad1a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I have visited the office few times and have called them as well. The staff is nice and customer service is ok. They need to fix the info on their website due to docs requirements. Such as, mentioning of mailing an extra empty envelope to resend docs back to the applicant address or asking for what type of docs should an applicant bring original or copies.< /Text>< pictures>

I have been calling them for the longest, sent them an email, approached them on facebook but NO ANSWER in no where. If this was an American they would have sued them but we just have to sit quite and wait for them but I will not and Im going to take this matter to someone who can actually teach them how to do their job. A husband and wife is the lead in there how can people expect them to do anything for afghans, I'm sure they aren't even open for the hours listed on here and if they are they lock the door from inside, sit keep eating pork until closing and leave. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU WORKING THERE.<//Text>

<review>unfortunately these afghans no matter where they live, they won't learn any thing from any one. There is no customer service at all. no one answers the phone calls. every one working in consulate are  mean to the customers , if you go there they act like they are not there to help you or to work. The afghan government needs to find a better counselor so he can manage the team properly and teach them how to work in consulate.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Unprofessional people sitting there. They don’t know how to answer phone calls. They don’t know how to speak to their own people. If it comes to Non Afghan they kiss their Hands. But sorry to say they treat their own people very Bad. If u guys needs to get anything done from this embassy. Find out different way to get your work done.

I rarely write a review, I went to our own Afghan Consulate and saw old women's, who has been suffering from sugar has been awaiting for last 3 to 4 hours only for a letter and no one helping them. Secondly, As its like a small window and they hear with one ear and give solutions from their own, wait i will go and ask hours passed, but nothing. it looks like - consulate staffs are very weak/very lazy to work. They ask you to email, but never ever responds back. pls appoint professional people, who can serve people not sleep in consulate.<//Text>

In the USA? and specially in LA? and the customer service is so low!!!! they never answer the phone :(  I tried more then 10 times every single day but not a single answer :(

They need to reform the staff for sure ......... or hire some one to only answer the phone calls and help people with their easy and simple question.< /Review>

Hello all viewers,

I drove all the way from East Bay to LA which took me almost seven hours. I spend a night in a hotel in Hollywood and went to The Consulate next day. I've already prepared all needed documents which was mentioned on the website.
All the staffs were very friendly. There was a little bit confusion. They asked for some documents which were not mentioned on the website. However I made those documents ready there and submitted to them. They took my original documents and there is no guarantee if they get lost. However I took the risk and hope to get them back.
Recommendation:
They need to work on their website a little bit and keep it up to date.
Over all good staff.< /Text>

<Review>Why won't they answer their phone? I have been calling for the last couple of days. They don't even have a voicemail set up. Please try to pay attention to your customer service. We Afghans depend on your service when it comes to our Afghan passport and national ID card. We need your service and if you are not doing your job, please leave so someone else with better work ethics can step in. This is ridiculous.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My Afghan brothers and sisters don't complain we are Afghans we should suffer even in USA from our government.by the way it's a branch of Afghan government even worse than offices in Afghanistan,I applied for birth certificate and passport they promised To send me passport and birth certificate in 14 days but I got my passport after 25 days. Instead of birth certificate they mailed application and money order of my birth certificate finally after two days of calling them they answered the phone I told the lady you guys send my application back without sending my  birth certificate, you know what she told me she said send it back to us we forgot to apply for you even she didn't apologize.i told her you guys couldn't see the money order ,application,copy of my document ,long story short she transferred my call to another lady, this lady was already mad at me she started fighting on the phone with me. The  First Lady was talking a little bit nicer than her , this lady told me send it back or come back apply again and she hang up the phone.then I give up I said  need the birth certificate cancelled my plan going to Kabul. They  wasted my time driving from San Francisco to LA.</Text>

The Afghan Consulate in Las Angeles are doing an excellent job, they are doing work with amazing speed up, great professionalism, listening to clients and taking care of the clients needs on the spot.

They have very talented and customer oriented staff,  I have called several times in a day and had so many questions, every time I called they were pleased to help and happily assisted, they are expert in their work and very professional.

I was assisted by Shahnaz Amin and she was greatly able to give me all details I needed and sent me the forms that I needed to fill up and submit back to the Consulate. Greatly Appreciated.<//text>

I have not any interaction with this consulate so far,  going to apply for computerized passports next week, so i am keeping my fingers crossed i would not have any issues. Giving the 5 stars just to get somebody's attention at the consulate, that at least they should try to change their ratings and service. Each time an Afghan walks into this consulate should come somewhat satisfied. My question, is somebody at the Embassy reading these disgrunted cutomers?</Review>

You have to have a tazkara to get a passport. That's the only way, I'm told. The idiot guy tells me have someone in Afghanistan go to Ministry of Interior and get me a Tazkara!!!! This is stupid. I'm right in front of their eyes, speaking Dari, holding my US passport and Citizenship, AND and expired Afghan passport for them to verify my identity, yet they want want something from Afghanistan where nobody knows who I am. Eventually, the guy made a killer suggestion. He suggested I go to Afghanistan, get a Tazkara, and a passport! Seriously? Sorry fellas, these are the people that represent us. Shame on them.</Text>< rating>

Worst customer service ever.
I called them to ask on the status of my visa, a lady answered the call, she said she will call me back in few minutes. Never got a call back, never.

I wouldn't be surprised if I had such a customer service in AFG, but I thought maybe these guys are better than those folks in AFG coz they have a chance to see the standards of customer service in the U.S. but unfortunately they've brought this bad customer service culture with them from AFG and I have no hope if it would change.<//review>

They don't deserve even one star. They are not qualified to manage the embassy.  They are a bunch of uneducated and uncivilized people. They don't care about the customers at all. The funny thing is that they are not aware about what they have posted in their official website!! 😒<//review>

The worst customer service
The worst experience of my life
That's why we never grow up  that's why we never get better because that's how Afghan people work
it's a shame completely shame
I was support to get my wife's visa in two days it's been two week I've been calling them nobody's answering I just wanna know that they have everything so we can have the visa I already bought my ticket and I don't know how long it's gonna take for visa
They're working just like Afghanistan offices
That means nobody's working over there
It's been three days I'm asking can you guys check the email I sent a paper they say  the guy who checked the email is not here  , what the hell is that mean ?</text>

If you want your passport to be mail to your address from LA you should get an envelope from post office with tracking number both for $6 otherwise those people in consulate will ask you $25 money order
At that moment if you try to go to post office to get envelope it will take one hour to post office with that crazy traffic in LA
Thank you
Good luck< /Text><Name>SAMI sami</Name>< pictures>

So frustrating, I think this office is full of incompetent people, I can never get hold of them through phone I have been trying to call them for the past 5 days in the times that they have specified open hours. I think they still haven't heard of email, does not respond to any emails. Does not reply to any mails through post. I could have probably got my job done from Washington if I wrote to them by now.</Review>

The Consulate of Afghanistan residing in Las Vegas has nothing to do except to sue the Afghans residing in California. It may take a week if I file a complaint against this fake office. May God (c) make the officials of this office understand their duty to the works that are paid from the Afghan Government !!! And don't hurt people !!! They are just sitting in their seats for money and misery! And their nose is in the sky They think they know everything but alas a hundred alas !!!

<Review>(Translated by Google) Hello friends, I wish you good health. After greetings, I applied for my passport. Within a month, if I did not get my passport, I would call Washington and I would always answer a jelly. Afghanistan does not respond. If it has such representatives, the one who expects them to serve is Abdullah Nafar.
Thank you

I continue to be amazed by this place in the way they conduct business and how they keep the place in such pristine condition. The staff, particularly Dan, is so easy to talk to and always goes out of his way to ensure everything is taken cared of to our satisfaction. I would not entrust any of my belongings to any other place and would not hesitate to recommend Extra Storage Place to anybody on the look out for a safe and clean place for storage 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼<//text>

<review>Dan is literally the Man! He was and is extremely helpful and made sure to guide me in the right direction for what I’m needing. Dan Daniels was very busy at the time I arrived to the sterns Simi Valley location. It was impressive how he was able to tend to the multiple phone calls coming in as well as assist me in showing two different size storage units. I could go to a different storage company and save some money but that’s not happening do to the hospitality & professionalism I get here at Etta space storage. It’s a really clean and well secured location. Perfect for people that need storage that work in the film industry like myself.< /review>< userid>

And let me add it has to be one of the most safest places to store any valuable belongings -because they literally watch this place like it's their home, they know people that are renting too and if anybody else comes in they question it due to the fact that they want to keep this place anyone who has a unit  safe..  which I see is a great way to run a business especially A storage facility. Both Dan and Chad are super awesome and friendly oh and very understanding no matter what you ask them or need from them..

This facility is SUPPER CLEAN AND SAFE . Don't think twice about renting anywhere else .. i recommend this place with out a doubt..<//review>< pics>

<username>Ben S.< /username><Review>This was an incredibly simple and fast process.  The office was even closed when I processed the lease.  All info comes to you via email and txt.

I didn't really like that I was forced to by insurance but I would have had to do so in the office too.  There is also a $25 admin fee and a lock fee of which you may return  unopened for credit.

Nonetheless I still give 5 stars because it really was easy and efficient.<//Review>< user_id>

This is a neat and tidy space for storing items. Units are a little small, but they are tall and there seems to be plenty of space for storing. I am renting a 5x5, but the do have larger. The place is extremely clean and well managed. Dan, is helpful and helped us move our stuff into our unit, which was really quite nice!  The only advice I have is if you are wanting to get the one month free deal, sign up on the 1st of the month, if you do not do this, you do not technically get your first month free as you will be charged the within the same month, for ex if you sign up on June 10th, you will be charged on July 11th, even if you have only been in the rental for 31 days, however this can easily be remedied if you booked on the 1st of June, then your first billing would be July 1st, allowing June to be your free month. I ended up paying in the month that should have been free because I signed on April 28th, then was billed on May 29th, but other than this misunderstanding I had, the location is great, the place is well kept, Dan is very helpful and readily available to help you with whatever you need. The process is easy and everything was completed in a matter of minutes. I do recommend this location and working with Dan!</text>

<text>Hi everyone! My family and I are transitioning from our home and needed a facility that was in town. Like you all, I am always looking for the best deal when I use my hard earned money. At the end of the day I chose Extra Storage because of “first month free” promotion. I ended up only paying $38 to receive services. Mind you, it may have come out to a little bit more but I have a lock that I bought from Extra Storage when I used them last. Went with a 10*10 unit and took my time to fill it up over the span of a week. Easy to use access code, clean facilities, and speedy check out. If you are interested I’d call right away and take advantage of the promotion. If you are in Simi Valley ask for Dan. He is a straight up guy and will get you in and out. Which reminds me... there’s an In & Out right next door! Anyways, that’s my experience thus far. I will keep you up to date. Good luck everyone!<//text><date>1591723651459<//date><userid>114668809665343231973< /userid><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

Checked online for a new storage space and found extra space in Simi Valley. The prices were amazing and the whole process signing up a new contract was very easy and painless.
Dan made everything so simple. When we got our unit I couldn’t believe how clean the space was. The property is maintained very well.
Thank you again Dan we’re very happy.< /review>

Very professional place. Took about 10 minutes over the phone and then a quick signature and we were able to move into the unit that day.

< Review>
I own a moving business and was in need of extra storage space for our equipment and supplies.

I went to Extra Space storage in Simi Valley to check prices and availability of a 10x25 unit.  The site manager came outside and greeted me ( office closed due to covid).  He instructed me to look at their “display” unit to decide  what size I would want.

I chose the 10x25 unit.  The manager instructed me to start the process on-line.  He walked me through each step through texting.  The process was fast and easy and the unit was secured.

The storage facility exceeded my expectation and I am glad I chose this location over the others.  The facility has great security and very spacious “aisles” big enough for two vehicles to pass.  Going in and out of the facility is a breeze.

5 stars for Extra Space Storage and the great management team.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Getting a storage is all new to me. But I had to do it due to an unexpected time and situation.  I just lost my husband August of 2018 tragically and had to move out from our place a month later. Found Extra Space Storage and as soon as I walked into the office, Dan the office manager was very accommodating and made everything run smoothly for me considering my situation at that time. He made me feel that the storage is an extension of my home. Making me feel secured as far as my personal belongings. He gave me a great deal that perfectly met my needs. I’m just so glad I picked this facility. Awesome service and amazing staff. Will ever be grateful to Dan Daniels for all his help. Their service has been a part of rebuilding my and my daughter’s life as we move on. Thank you so much and more power to your business!</Review>< pictures>

Although I did not keep this storage long like I did at Public Storage, this place was clean, well kept and Dan, the store manager was courteous when we opened up the unit with him and also when I recently closed it. I also felt like my items at this storage unit was safe and secure due to someone actually living on the property, I liked that! Good Job to this storage unit location! If I ever decide to use a storage unit again, I would definitely use Extra Space!</text>

I went over to different storage here in Simi Valley this is the one I like most. It is clean, well organized, easier to reach. The staffs are very accommodating, friendly & ready to help to renter if there is a problem related to the space inside the compound. I will recommend this storage to my friends who want extra space to store their stuffs< /Review>

When space became short it was time to look for extra storage. Found this gem in Simi Valley which is right down the street from the business. With one visit I was able to speak to Dan and Jake who took care of our storage needs. Best prices in town and amazing service. Prices were so great that we ended up getting two units. Thanks for all your help. A+<//Text>

I am in midst of a difficult out of state move...I needed a storage unit to fit my needs. I found Extra Space Storage online last night & found a unit that was exactly what I needed & at an excellent price!
I was so happy with their customer service, Dan, the manager, called me the very next morning to see how he could help & what needs I had. When I arrived, driving through the property I was impressed, so thrilled to see how beautiful the facilities were...and the layout, cleanliness, & security...and customer service from Dan was fantastic!!!
Signing contract & getting set up was made easy by his clear & concise explanations.
I've been to other storage facilities over the years and I really was blown away! I know my stored items will be safe and if any issues that may arise, will be handled in a professional & friendly, and attentive manner.
Dan is wonderful & he made the process of renting a unit smooth, easy, and no stress...in midst of a very stressful move??? What a blessing!
I highly recommend Extra Space Storage for any of your storage & moving needs!!!<//Text>

Made the "paperwork" (all digital) easy to handle, and made sure I got to know his manager, Dan, who was very gracious.

The best kind of customer service is when someone anticipates your needs and questions, addressing them before they come up. That's what Jake did. Example, we were loading the storage unit on a late warm afternoon, and Jake shows with 4 cups of cold water for my guys and me. That's class!</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Jake is an amazing job helping me out with finding a storage for my needs. He took his time explain everything well to me. He went out of his way to make sure I understand all the paperwork.  This guy deserves more than five stars.<//Review>

<review>In 2007, I rented a 5 x 10 storage from Extra Space Storage in Simi Valley for my mother and kept it for a few years. My experience then was amazing!!! Carlos and Reyna Martinez accommodated my needs and provided excellent service throughout my rental.

Seven years later, I needed a storage again and without a doubt, I contacted them for availability and instantly provided me the 5 x 5 that I needed.

The most crucial factors in determining the storage facility are location, security, cleanliness, safety, price, and overall experience with the managers/owners. Extra Space Storage ranks #1!!!!! No other storage in Simi Valley will offer all this. The managers are on-site so I feel confident that my personal possessions in their storage are secure.

Carlos and Reyna are very professional and courteous, sincere, and honest. It's great to know they are still there to manage the facility and provide the excellent service-which is why I came back!!!

Thank you, Carlos and Reyna for everything that you do!!! You two are awesome!!!!< /review>< Rate>

Met with Dan, was very nice and helpful.
Storage unit was in good condition, facility was clean and well kept.
Price was good for a 10’x15’ unit was 250$ plus they have their own insurance for fire, water damage, and theft with 0 deductible for an addition 26$ a month. ( price varies with price of storage goods)</Text>

<Text>Fast, efficient service! I set up a reservation online early this morning, Dan called me at opening. I came in within the hour , toured the property while comparing unit sizes, and secured my unit. All you need is your ID and a credit card and you are good to go!

I’ve been with Extra Space Storage for a year in a half now. I’ve always been treated with kindness and professionalism. I came here during a time of hardship. While I am still enduring a hardship, and  I recently required an immediate need for a larger unit. This is when I met Dan Daniels, who is the store manager. His professionalism is beyond approach! He expeditiously took care of my needs, resolving every issue, from size of unit, to cost and location. I can’t tell you how important it was for me to stay at this location. I am a retired Army soldier. I’ve had storage units all over the US. This has been the best by far. If you need a great place for storage, this is it!<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I have had a storage unit here for a few years for a reason. Reyna and Carlos Martinez run the property very well. I have had 2 other storage units 2 other places and i would have to say this is my favorite. The grounds are always clean, i feel like my equipment is more secure, They are very professional and caring, and after moving my business equipment i can eat at In and Out burgers. So i have to say, that this is a great storage unit if you have motorcycles, video equipment (Business equipment), and basically anything big or small.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e829cca5dfc687:0xbbe2ec7de1a17a15</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We are new to Simi Valley so we need experienced customer service professionals and Dan called me back promptly after my inquiry online. That’s great service! Don’t look any further for your storage needs! Spaces are immaculate, with great customer service...a no-brainer.

I have been renting here for a long time.  24-7-365 onsite staff is friendly, professional, and conscientious.  Facility is always clean, well kept, and secure with vigilant long-term employees.  Customer friendly hours.  If there is ever an issue, staff is prompt to resolve.  Hard to improve on perfection.  Would not rent from anyone else.  A+ rating in my book.  Thanks!<//review>

<Review>Everything went very smoothly to get the unit rental agreement set up and the location of the unit was perfect for me.  The assistant manager handled it for me, and he was very professional and personable, and very efficient.  Extra Space Storage is such a nice clean location - very glad I switched from my previous location.  When I actually moved in today, the unit was so clean, and ready for me.  Loved the experience.  I have rented from Extra Space Storage years before (in Palmdale), which is one reason I switched to Extra Space again.  Great experience at both locations.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The staff at Extra Space have been great.  We are moving and have had to move everything we own into and out of a unit.  It is clean and secure and I have had no problems or worries.  Even when the staff knew that we would be short term tenants they still were very professional and helpful.  I would definitely get another unit here if the need arose!  Thank you for such a positive experience!<//Text>

I have been with this location for several years.. Carlos and his wife and son make an excellent team and always take care of all of my needs. They are all professional, caring and wonderful people. I might be able to pay less at some other facility, but the price of good customer service is what is really important to me. Thank you all for your continued loyalty to me.</review>

The assistant manager handled it for me, and he was very professional and personable, and very efficient.  Extra Space Storage is such a nice clean location - very glad I switched from my previous location.  When I actually moved in today, the unit was so clean, and ready for me.  Loved the experience.  I have rented from Extra Space Storage years before (in Palmdale), which is one reason I switched to Extra Space again.  Great experience at both locations.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I have been renting here for a long time.  24-7-365 onsite staff is friendly, professional, and conscientious.  Facility is always clean, well kept, and secure with vigilant long-term employees.  Customer friendly hours.  If there is ever an issue, staff is prompt to resolve.  Hard to improve on perfection.  Would not rent from anyone else.  A+ rating in my book.  Thanks!<//review>

I just got back from getting a storage unit at Extra Space Storage in Simi Valley.  The second I walked in the front door, I was greeted with a smile by Diana Lopez. The whole process took about 15 minutes. Diana was amazing to deal with, super friendly, and went out of her way to find discounts and applied them to my bill.<//review>

I originally had planned to rent from ExtraSpace last September, but delayed until April.  Carlos checked with me periodically over the months and kept me informed of availability and to see if I was ready.  When the time came, he was very professional and helpful.  The facility is very clean, well maintained, and convenient.< /Review>

I have been with this location for several years.. Carlos and his wife and son make an excellent team and always take care of all of my needs. They are all professional, caring and wonderful people. I might be able to pay less at some other facility, but the price of good customer service is what is really important to me. Thank you all for your continued loyalty to me.<//review>

First of all I want to say the staff is amazing and are very professional. The manager Reyna is friendly and easy to work with. She knows how to connect with her customer. A clean, safe, gated, and the surveillance is spectacullar in protecting my belongings. Thank you Reyna and team for your EXCELLENT SERVICE and professionalism. Looking forward to continue to refer my friends and family.

Sue k. Is an awesome employee. She was very helpful in helping  find a perfect storage parking  for my company truck.  And I also got my first month free.

Best storage in Simi Valley

Carlos and his team are great people to have watching over your storage.  I totally trust the secure and clean environment and the people who run it are just the best. They are always there when I needed some assistance or help even when I was traveling for my work. I recommend Extra Space highly because of the personal attention and also the security of knowing that my stuff is going to be okay even if I'm on the other side of the nation doing some work. Thanks Carlos and your team because it's one less thing I have to worry about when  I am frequently out of town.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80e829cca5dfc687:0xbbe2ec7de1a17a15<//Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>104004652181401120605< /user_id>< response>

We have been using ExtraSpace Storage for two years and when Dan Daniels took over it was much easier to do business with them.  The first person did not explain things well, nor was he helpful.  Completely the opposite with Dan Daniels!  He has been extremely helpful with situations  that came up and explained any options available.  We are very happy with this new management!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Jake is super helpful.  I wanted a particular kind of unit that wasn't available, so I got the "next best" thing and asked him to contact me if one of the ones I was interested in opened up.  He called me a few weeks later with the good news that the unit I had wanted was vacated and I moved in.   Both of the units were very clean, one of the advantages in my opinion to this facility vs. the nearby public storage is that it is single story and the units are on concrete slab and the walls have metal sheeting inside..  I had a unit upstairs in public storage and the floor was plywood and patched with ducttape in some places!  The walls at public storage were only drywall on ONE side of the studs.  Additionally all the units seem to have rollup doors and at least mine has a light.  My 5x10 at public storage had a swing door and lacked a light.  Overall, very happy with my upgrade to Extra Storage which is 5x15 and cheaper than the 5x10 I had at public storage.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>For 5 years I have stored my "extra stuff" here and couldn't be happier with this facility. Clean, big units to store my stuff. Key coded gate access for privacy and security and never had any problems getting in or out. Carlos and Reyna provide quality customer service and care to their unit holders...and on a personal note both are just really nice, wonderful people to talk too and do business with. I would use this facility again as well as recommend it to family and friends. This is the place your "Extra Stuff" belongs...Don't go anywhere else! ~ Mitch Holloway<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80e829cca5dfc687:0xbbe2ec7de1a17a15</GmapID></record>

< Review>
When I first moved to Simi Valley I found Extra space storage here on Stearns not only did I fall in love with the facility but the way Dan and Jake treated me I couldn't wait to store my stuff again. Moving is an extremely emotionally draining experience and they were so kind. I couldn't recommend them enough! Xo<//Review>

<review>Regina and Carlos ROCk!!!  Been renting from them - Extra Space, for over a year. So,
been in office many , many times, paying rent, and overheard their always helpful, always pleasant, always wholly professional manner in which they handle people and their problems. I so appreciate the same with me. And in particular, I really appreiate, how it is kept clean. Carlos and Reina are a sweet, hardworking couple with five great kids!  Bring your business to them and be assured, they will take as good of care of your every need as they have mine! I am grateful my belongings are stored somewhere safe and secure and with folks like Carlos and Reina, so nice, so helpful and professional.

To say they go above and beyond the Call of Duty is truly an understatement. They will accommodate and assist in any way they can. They are not just the utmost of professionals, but they are truly, truly caring. I cannot imagine that there is another place in this city thar can begin to provide the service and care that EZ Storage in Simi Valley provides.</Text>

Extremely clean facility and friendly and knowledgeable managerial staff.
Would definitely refer this facility to anyone. Clean spaces, clean grounds, and seems extremely secure. # 1 storage facility in Ventura county as far as I'm concerned.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have rented spaces here for more than 3 years now. I had 2 separate spaces and they called me to let me know that a space was available for me to combine the 2 spots into 1. Which saved me close to $300.00 a month!

Can't thank the people at the Simi Valley Extra Space for their service and professionalism.

<review>They advertised a free first month th with a good price, but when I got there and was done with the tour, the prices climbed.  There was an.admin fee and they require you to pay insurance monthly and they said I could have the price advertised.  Not happy, but the facility was clean and well kept.  They dont have a gate access bu car.  They made it so to get in and out, you must also get out of your car to punch in the access code, then get back in and do the s as me thing to get back out.  That's annoying.  I'll use them because I was there.  That bIt and switch and hidden charges that showed up left a bad taste.< /review>< pictures>

<Date>1412112862292</Date><review>Moving can sometimes be a interesting time in someones life.Especially when it involves a new baby new job new place like in our families case. When the ambient surrounding all seems to be in line with the proccess it helps alot. This means all your stuff shows up unbroken on time the new place is great like you expected it to be etc. By now your asking how does this tie in with Extra Space Storage, well we had to much belongings to place around the rooms, but it all was nice personal stuff we wanted! so now what. We visited several storage facilities in Simi Valley with mixed feelings about which place felt right and how convenient it's location was. I have to say when we walked into the Sterns Extra Space Storage facility it was a breath of fresh air the right ambient as I mentioned earlier. Carlos Martinez and his wife were so professional and family like based, Carlos answered and suggested logistic questions my wife and I had as if we had done business before. As of to date 5 years later we still continue to have great service with all our storage needs, Best Regards to Carlos and his family.Thanks for being there,Thomas and Fatima Rhodes.</review><Response>None< /Response>< user>
