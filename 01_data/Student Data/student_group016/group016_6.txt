A visit to DMD Bernardo Gonzales’ office is like takin a ride in Aretha’s Pink Cadillac. Every thing is fine tuned for a smooth ride and the music is fantastic. From the minute you walk in the door you’re taken care of, there’s plenty of knowledgeable staff always there to lend a hand wherever needed. I always leave wondering how they accomplished what they did so quickly.</Review>

My Husband & I are appreciative of Dr. Gonzalez's Dental Service. He is always clear with explanation of dental procedures before beginning. We give him a "5 Star Rating!"

He & Staff work well together, & the office is kept immaculately clean!  Also, Dr. Gonzalez has a wonderful Hygienist on Staff, who is extremely thorough with his work.

We are always greeted by the receptionists in a friendly, professional way.  They are patient, kind, & answer all our questions. We look forward to returning soon.

Regards,
Charles & Kathleen Clary</Text>

Dr. Gonzalez is THE dentist to go to. He does everything...meaning you won’t have to go to a specialist for a root canal or crown. He is expert in all procedures. His office is in the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District, so it’s easy to get there. Everyone in the office is extremely friendly and competent, especially Rosie at the front desk.< /Review>

From my initial call to the office, speaking with Rosie and making my appointment, through my visit with Dr. Gonzalez, I am 100% satisfied. The office is scrupulously clean, and I felt very well taken care of there. Dr. Gonzalez and Rosie are very caring, as is everyone else in the office. What is extremely impressive is their communication. I called and left a message, and they got back to me right away. Another time I called, but did not leave a message, and they sent me a text message saying that they were sorry they missed my call. They asked me to leave a message, and they would get right back to me.< /Text>

I recommended this office to a colleague of mine and she absolutely loved the experience. Due to COVID I have been without dental insurance for a while. I started to get dental discomfort and had to get dental insurance. After securing insurance, I made an appointment explaining my dental discomfort. They have excellent Covid protocols in place such as only letting you in 10 minutes before appointment, taking your temperature, having you sanitize your hands, etc. Plus their constant level of cleaning is incredible. The X Ray technician was very kind and efficient. Abdul, the hygienist, is incredible. I have had him before. He did a really great job on cleaning my mouth and doing an examination so that he could note his observations for the doctor.

On a scale of 1 - 10, I rate them a 12! Great service, great prices and family atmosphere. If going to the dentist makes you nervous and worried, you should definitely come here.

Got a root canal there once, asked when they would be finished expecting the normal discomfort from the procedure... Dr. Gonzalez said "I'm already finished, just updating your chart.

I was pretty shocked at how smoothly that went! Always look forward to visiting my dentist. Multiple chairs means less time in the waiting room. They've turned this into a science!< /Review>

<Text>I had a great experience with Dr. Gonzalez as a first time patient.

The office staff was helpful and positive, and I was seen a few minutes after checking in.

They used a modern 3D X-ray machine and all of the equipment seemed up to date.

Dr. Gonzalez was down to earth and friendly, and he pointed out issues in a positive way and made great conversation.

I rarely recommend dentists, but I’ll be back here next time for sure.</Text><user>115368819567697075077</user>< rating>

I don't like dentists. I had become accustom to dentists being heavy handed and to me a trip to the dentist that required any procedure meant I was walking out numb but still in pain and hurting for a couple days after. I had to make an emergency appointment. The website gives a number to call in an emergency. I called it and surprisingly it was the actual dentists number. It was pretty early in the morning and I could tell I may have been interrupting his routine. He said he'd call me back after explaining the situation. He called back and gave me an appointment time... Didn't expect that. I get there and due to covid u can't just walk in and they are limiting the number of patients allowed in at a time. In fact they won't let you in more than 10 minutes prior to appointment. I can definitely appreciate the safety measures taken. The asked me the covid questions. Took my temp and handed me hand sanitizer... Within minutes I was x-rayed. Then sat in the chair.The dentist then casually says. I needed a root canal.. Before my mind could fully process and start having anxiety. He was so quick and smooth about everything I didn't even notice the needle he pulled out to numb me. I barely felt it. Normally this is one of the worst parts for me. He told me it'd be quick and he'd have me out of pain in no time. He wasnt lying. He actually paid attention to my reactions and did exactly what he said. I had a root canal and cleaning for the rest of my teeth can honestly say this was the best visit Ive ever had a dentist. I was in and out. Pain relieved. I took ibuprofen that night and the next day and Ive been doing great since. I'm extremely happy with my experience and I will keep him as my dentist. He did a fantastic job.< /Review>

Best dentist ever! I hate going to the dentist, I’ve always had a phobia. Before going to Dr. Gonzalez I used to fly out of the country to a dentist I was comfortable with. His prices are also VERY good. So far I’ve had cavities filled, and cleanings. This month I’ll be getting a dental implant done. His work is extremely good.</Text>

My visit with Dr.Gonzalez went extremely well today , ss i was in alot of pain from one of my upper molers. Dr. Gonzalez performed a root canal which we will finish up next week. In the meantime, he deadened the root to that tooth, and the pain has gone away. He was fast,efficient, and got the job done. I arrived with lots of pain, and left with none. He is very good and knows what he's doing. I would give him a 10 on the scale and highly reccomend his services to anyone in need of dental care......</text>

<Text>This place is average/below average... I’ve seen Dr. Gonzalez for several years because it takes our Blue Shield plan and is close.

Pros: they take insurance, the dentist seems generally competent and some of the dental hygienists (Abdul) are very good

Cons: I would appreciate more communication/ better bedside manner from the dentist as other reviewers have also noted. They also need to make sure the scheduling is working--You can wait 30 minutes to more than an hour just to be seated.

—Overall it’s a mixed experience. Ymmv.< /Text>< user_id>

The receptionist does not speak English too well, so make sure to speak slow for her to understand you. Else she will get frustrated and hang up on you</Text>

<text>I have been seeing Dr Gonzalez since 1991 and my experience with his practice is one hundred percent totally and completely positive. Big thumbs up to  Isabel the front desk who greet everyone by name and all make you feel right at home the atmosphere in the office is relaxed with always playing good music. Gloria the office manager makes a person, in this case, feel like a true friend. I feel Gloria deserves a salary of a quarter Million dollars a year. She is that good! You should hire people just like her. She is one in a Million

I have been a patient of Dr Gonzalez patient for 28 years never left his practice.  I have had everything from routine exams/cleaning to emergency root canals & crowns, and have always received the very best of care. (I can honestly say I have never felt one bit of pain while sitting in a chair in this office). Dr. Gonzalez never tried to sell me any additional / unnecessary dental work. His work is excellent he just replaced three of my old crowns with crowns that are made with a newer material they look like real teeth

His office staff has always been top notch about filing insurance claims with Delta Dental for me. My co-payments paid the Doctor never amount to much ever

Allways a great experience at Dr Gonzalez Office<//text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I have had a very good experience going to Dr. Gonzalez. I am a new patient and my wife has been a patient of the Doctors for close to 10 year's. She's had nothing but good thing's to say about Dr. Gonzalez, she loves the Administrator Isabel who is at the front desk. The atmosphere is one that is pleasant and has a family oriented aura about the place..... We appreciate the cleanliness, the professionalism and the knowledge both Dr. Gonzalez has as well as Isabel when she helps you understand the procedures and options you have regarding the financial responsibility....

Thank you to the entire staff.... B/R, Eric Bailey II</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I highly recommend Dr. Bernardo Gonzalez!!!  Dr. Gonzalez and his staff are highly efficient, professional, accommodating and friendly.

My root was infected and my tooth had to come out.  I called Dr. Gonzalez's office to make an appointment and was given an appointment with in a day.

I was extremely nervous about getting my tooth extracted but relaxed once I spoke with Dr. Gonzalez and saw that he was highly experienced.  Dr. Gonzalez has seen it all!!!!

My treatment was quick, efficient and, thanks to Novocain, painless :)  I didn't believe it when he told me that he was finished :)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e4be19cf99f:0xec23fcf4b87bd408<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went in for a consult to check my cracked tooth. He started by mocking the rest of the fillings I had got from some other dentist. I clearly told him which tooth concerns me. But thanks to him checking THREE patients at a time (alternating between the three), he forgot which tooth I had mentioned and numbed the area. I wasnt aware that he filled the wrong tooth until I got home.I called the office and the assistant confirmed that the records had what I said. So when I went back I nervously told the dentist he did the wrong tooth.  He blurted out in anger - "I can't go back in time. I can do the other tooth for FREE if you want!" , flipped his hair and walked away. I mean, how rude is that? All I wanted was him to be nice. The anesthesia was so painful too! I've never had such a bad experience. Wish he had better bed side manners and took time to do ONE patient at a time< /text>< GmapID>

<text>The representative Thomas tricked me. Put on my account hotspot and video streaming which I never requested and after I got caught his lie- he told that he asked me but actually he never did. Representative Thomas. BEWARE!

UPDATE: in a short while after leaving the review- I got message from att that I canceled promotional smartphone credit(which I never did)- so it all looks like I deal with robbers and scammers but not with a trustworthy company.😢</text>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Went to the galleria store before heading over to this store. Was welcomed in by the staff immediately, and was checked in for the wait. I was assisted by Trebor who was really helpful. He got me and my family of 4 signed up for service. The manager was also very helpful with deciding which phones to get and helped explain the promotions we would be able to receive. Overall great experience, we are going to be sending some more family this way to the store. They were even able to maintain positive and professional while other customers were causing a scene inside the location. Whoever trained this team deserves a raise!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The Service / sales consultant was amazing.   I think her name is Skyler.  She was so friendly and professional and took great care.  Give that young lady a pay raise or promotion.<//Text>

Had to go in a couple times for some issues with coming over from another carrier. Alexia & Nia were so helpful! The second time I came in I worked with Tyler. Always eager to help, and gets what I need done in such a timely manner. Recommend this store over any local stores!< /Review></record>

<text>Horrible experience. I went in to get a new screen protector for my iPhone 11 max pro. The person working was Terrance and he was on his phone when I walked in. No big deal but when I asked for help he just pointed to the area where the screen protectors were. I brought one back and asked if it would fit and he stated no while still sitting down on his phone. I asked if he could get off his chair and come help me which he did with his negative body language. He stated there were not any for my phone. As I was walking out I told him he needed to have better customer service and get off his phone and help customers. He then started to clap his hands as I was walking out. I asked if a manager was there and he stated no. I asked what his name was and he held his shirt up with his name badge with a smile on his face. I will not be going back to that store. Go to the one on galleria Blvd, they are way better and great at customer service.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We went to the store on Stanford Ranch Road in Roseville California. We were taken very well care of by David and Skyler.
They were very knowledgeable on all the products that AT&T has to offer. We ended up purchasing AT&T TV in place of our DIRECTV. They also ended up switching our phones from Verizon to AT&T. They found us the perfect plans and saved us a lot of money. $70 between both products and we ended up with a cell phone plan that has unlimited data. We were thrilled!
They were great when it came to helping us find every discount possible. We totally recommend either David or Skyler to help anyone with their AT&T needs.
A++++ you guys are awesome!</Review><Rate>5</Rate><user_id>111971794354151661686</user_id>< Date>

<text>This has to be the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced personally. I work in customer service and I pride myself on giving my customers a 5 star experience. I wish they had negative star reviews as the 2 gentleman working in this star greatly earned this negative review.

I went into this store explaining that my iPhone had been stolen expecting to receive some type of help. I thought wrong, while one of the gentleman assisted another customer with her issue, the available representative went to write down a number that I could call to file a claim with my insurance on the phone.

As I explained that my cellular device was STOLEN and I had no way of calling anyone without a cell phone, I asked them what other options I might have considering my position. ( I live alone and do not have any other phones available to me) The customer service rep that was assisting the other customer (with an attitude) asked me why don’t I just go online , as I explained my situation I do not have a computer or home phone I would not be able to do this. Which is why I came into the store AT&T who I purchased this phone from to get some HELP. As they DID NOT help me but offered for me to use the store phone , I noticed them just sitting around (of course no other customers were in the store at the time) but while a customer is seeking assistance, no reason both reps should be sitting at a table relaxing on phones while “Working’ .

In the end my iPhone 11 Pro was retuned to my possession (Thank god) because the at&t reps were less than helpful and I have made a final decision to remove my device from this service and never use at&t again . They are unreliable, misleading, unhelpful and a corrupt service provider.

I hope anyone that needs help in the future with this company, gets the help they are requesting as I DID NOT !<//text><Time>1616173111193</Time>< rate>

We love this park and all those use it! What a great time we had as a city gathered together on Easter Sunday. The Rock Seal Beach appreciates all those who came and those who volunteered. You were a blessing to all those who came. Come visit us again 9AM & 11:15AM every Sunday 151 Marina Dr Seal Beach. You will be encouraged!!<//Text>

<Review>Beautiful park, snooty locals.
Took my retired father to the tennis courts for a game but found the single court occupied. Played on the only open Pickle-ball court using  pickle balls and tennis rackets, told to leave by male boomer Karen. Not a good way to introduce new players to a game.<//Review>< username>

Went here for a baby shower. It s nice and decent. They have an indoor area for events and the outside area has a playground and basketball courts. It's close by to the beach too so you could walk there if you wanted to.<//review>

<Review>Fantastic medical care for me this week! I've been suffering with neck and upper back pain for several months. Dr. Egbert and his staff got me in for an appointment almost immediately. I was evaluated thoroughly, had X-rays taken as a precaution, and adjusted perfectly to alleviate the pain and tension. Much improvement and feeling so much better now!!! Highly recommend this practice above all others.... you will not regret it.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Rosemarie Dumadara</user_name>< user>

I had my first appt with Dr Egbert and staff.
It was very thorough and the staff greeted me cheerfully as I arrived.   I am looking forward to my next appt and x-ray findings as well as a plan for continued treatment.< /text>

Staff is so kind! I feel like a known friend even on my very first visit. They are thorough and really care. My insurance doesn’t cover services, but they offer a military rate which is very helpful to me and my family. My daughter and I are both patients and have both found relief and quality care here. Thank you.< /text>

Staff is extremely kind and welcoming every visit.

There is hand sanitizer available in every room and they clean the tables before you enter.

The chiropractor is funny, kind and listens when you speak. Explains what you need and is friendly if you ask questions about your progress or what you need (always ask questions!).

The nurse practitioner Tabitha, who does needle injections for trigger points, is a sweetheart. While the treatment can be painful, Tabitha is very kind and empathic throughout it. She helps guide you through it and validates your experience. She switched to a smaller needle to reduce my overall pain without me asking!

Overall I highly recommend this place. Kind, professional, and to the point.<//Review>

<text>I visit Dr. Egbert on a weekly basis. He has been my "Go-To Chiropractor" since 2010. I spend time here in Santa Maria and my home in South Carolina. If I have a problem in SC, I do what I can to hold on until I make it back to Santa Maria for an adjustment. It's the quality of care I receive that has always made the difference for me. Now, Dr. Egbert has joined a team with a couple other doctors to address other needs, so on any given appointment you may end up having other issues handled same day. 5 Stars every day here - no need to look anywhere else.<//text>< pics>

I routinely recieved chiropractic care from Dr. Egbert throughout my last pregnancy, and had a very short and easy labor which I believe was a direct result of keeping my spine in order. I am a firm believer of chiropractic care, but am a bit more relaxed about it when not pregnant, unless I feel I need to be adjusted. When I found out I was pregnant again recently, I made another appointment and am currently receiving care at Restorative Spine and Joint again. I am very happy not only with the quality of care Dr. Egbert provides, but with the way I feel afterward. He's really good at what he does!</Text>

<review>I take my whole family here for regular chiropractor adjustments. Dr. Egbert is personable and truly cares about his patients. He works with my young children to help them be as comfortable as can be before, during, and after the adjustment. I’ve been going since I was pregnant with my third and took my youngest as soon as she was born! He is knowledgeable with additional training for chiropractic adjustments with children. His front staff is absolutely SUPERB- friendly and efficient (the best doctors office I’ve ever been to!). Even if I need a last minute adjustment for a migraine coming on, they fit me in! I’m so thankful for that as well as Dr. Egbert’s ability for emergency adjustments. Highly recommend!</review>< Pictures>

I feel like I'm the first patient of the day each appointment I've had.  Dr. Matt strives towards complete healing and has answered every question I have had.  I believe he truly cares about each individual who walks in for healing & treats them as such.  My recent visit was because of a migraine,  Dr. Matt was able to create enough movement in my neck to allow for enormous relief. I highly recommend and am thankful for Restorative Spine & Joint- Medical and Chiropractic.<//text>

I am a dental hygienist with a neck that isn't quite as curbed as it should be. I get a lot of physical exercise at the gym and doing BJJ, but my job has repetitive movements that can be damaging. He is the best. Gets me adjusted in the gentlest, kindest, most professional way I have experienced at any chiropractor. Without my regular visits my injuries would be more severe and I would be drastically shortening my career longevity. It is so important to me that I make it a priority and pay out of pocket, because my limited insurance does not cover chiropractor visits. It is that important. Spinal and nerve health affects your whole body. Thanks Dr. Awesome, you're the best!<//Text><userid>103661851146378360358<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<text>I'll have to admit I was always skeptical of chiropractics when I was younger. I had been to a couple and never really seemed to get any real results. Dr Egbert was able to localize that my back issues were due in large part to my hip alignment. I went from someone with constant underlining back pain to virtually none. He always knows exactly where it hurts and how to fix it. I highly recommend Restorative Spine!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1580844198362, 'text': "Thanks Mike for the great review - we're happy to be of help!"}<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ec6b5f8395a339:0x298bfc6870fec447< /Gmap_id></record>

The medical and office staff are professional and Dr. Egbert's knowledge and genuine concern for your well-being can not be matched. I have been treated by no fewer than 6 different chiropractors and all wanted to continue to adjust and decompress my back and hips, without really having a plan for wellness.  Dr. Egbert had a plan and demonstrated that it was the best course of action to treat a seemingly life long hip injury. Can't thank him enough for what he has done.< /review>

<review>Dr. Egbert and his staff also, Are oh so very nice and helpful. Dr. Egbert is the most knowledgeable and caring chiropractor I've ever been to.  I am a very complicated case but he takes the time to  listen to me and knows exactly what to do.  He doesn't rush you in and out, he takes the necessary time with each patient and I have never had to wait longer than five minutes, he is always on schedule.  I give Dr. Egbert the highest review possible. I refer all my friends and family to him, I really trust him.

<date>1551374498118< /date><rating>5</rating><review>I have Lupus and will get inflammation and pain in my chest, ribs, collarbone, and shoulders. Dr. Egbert is the only doctor that was able to help with chiropractic adjustment, manual therapy (targeted massage), and stretching. Out of the 4 other experiences I've had at physical therapy places to try and get treatment and some relief, Dr. Egbert had more knowledge and skills than them all. Dr. Egbert is very personable, and professional at all times. My highest complement is that Dr. Egbert is the most gentle and still very effective chiropractor I've ever been to, and I've had some doozies of abrupt, stressful chiropractic adjustments from other doctors. Dr. Egbert really is the best around.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1551384756256, 'text': 'Thank you for such a complimentary review!

<Review>First visit score is a 5 - staff was busy but prepared , Doctor Egbert's time was allotted well for my first visit - he has a refreshing sense of humor, is attentive & listened closely to my symptoms.The exam was thorough, a plan for restoration was discussed based on the exam.Treatment was provided and front staff provided a very accommodating  followup appointment schedule - Overall Im pleased with my choice and Thankful for some hope for a less painful & possibly pain free future. Thank you RS&J</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The best chiropractic experience I've ever had. I've had chronic back issues from a severe football injury several years ago. I am also a very active person, I Trail run 5-6 days a week, love all sports and being active with my kids. Back pain is not fun, and can slow you down quickly. For the last several months I've put in a lot of miles training for an ultra marathon. During the process, my back flared up really bad. It got so bad that I had to roll my back out and stretch for 30-40 minutes before starting my day, and stop running. After seeing Dr. Egbert, I felt immediate relief. The pain running down my right leg and lower back is gone, my neck and shoulders feel loose, and my body feels renewed. Dr. Egbert, was very thorough and patient. He took time to understand and asses the problem and really get to the root of some of my issues. Cannot thank him and recommend him enough!<//Review>

I had been a patient of Dr. E's for 2 years and have nothing but positive things to say! His knowledge goes beyond traditional chiropractic techniques, has the perfect mix of gentle yet forceful for adjustments, and is sure to make you smile each visit with his warmness.
I originally saw him for a case of one sided pigeon toed-ness which he helped manage to the point it is no longer a problem. Though there are skeptics, I truly feel his spinal adjustments helped with my chronic neck and shoulder pain. My mother had been through multiple chiropractors yet we both proudly recommend Egbert as the best. I only stopped going due to gradually needing less adjustments to the point where I no longer have serious pain.
His receptionists are kind, explain things clearly, and really on their A game when it comes to all services they're in charge of.
Bonus points: he's one of the few drs I've had send birthday cards!<//text>

I took my daughter there today and was very impressed with the staff and the treatment my daughter received.  She had not been to a chiropractor and he took the time to explain at length what the practice is and why the treatment is beneficial.  She was in much better shape when we left and we definitely will return for future needs....Great!!!!</review>

<Review>Last yr around halloween 2018 my back pain came back, i had hard time walking on halloween! I cant even walk my son, when i called their office they schedule me right away.. after my first visit.. it was just gone, like snap gone, so i see Dr Egbert every Mo now instead of my primary provider who keeps on telling me to take Tylenol (im allergic to advil(ibuprofen)) i have scollisis and this lower back pain with leg pain started after i gave birth, i cant put pressure on my feet, it come and goes, they charge $100 something first visit and $43 every month for my hips sake i would gladly pay.</Review>< Name>

<rating>1<//rating><review>My family and I suffered a fire at our home and First American has done nothing to help us. We've been homeless for almost a month now and they won't release any payments to get us back on our feet due to an internal error. I'm not sure why we as the homeowners are punished for mistakes made by the carrier. My family and I lost all our belongings, our 14 year old Maltese Poodle, and a roof over our head. We are struggling to get by and it's just a shame that no one at this company has any empathy for people suffering from a loss. I'm sure they wouldn't want to be treated this way if it were their home they just lost.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>they did an inspection of our home a year ago didn't tell us they were doing it and they are now not renewing our insurance because of an inspection from a year ago done without our knowledge we hadn't even lived in our home two days before they came out and did it and didn't tell us until a year later they. took pictures without our knowledge so we hadn't even had times to do repairs of the damage the previous homeowner did to our property. they also claim they can't do anything even though we have done the repairs and are still getting rid of our policy they are a joke and a scam that illegally inspects your property when you aren't present. and they won't tell you until a year later.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>I have been trying to have a insurance adjuster come out since last Tuesday (my initial call). My RV has a hole in the roof from a tree falling on it. I was told an adjuster would be out Wednesday or Thursday. On Friday morning I called again I was told they would put a red flag on my claim so they could get an adjuster out that same day or Saturday. Well now we are back to Monday and still nothing. This company really needs to wake up a 1.5 star rating is unacceptable. I would be embarrassed to own a company with that low of a rating.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Called and left a message with my claim adjuster's Supervisor, asking for a telephone call, regarding a complaint against the Adjuster.  To my surprise, my Adjuster called back stating his Supervisor requested that he call to resolve the issue.  I have been in upper management for years, never have I advised a subordinate with a pending complaint against them to call the complaining customer.  Eventually, I spoke with a supervisor, who openly stated it was a common practice for management to instruct the employee to litigate the complaints against themselves.  This is a horrible business practice and only compounds an already existing problem.  I am changing companies after my experience with First American Property and Casualty. Horrible customer service.</Review>< rating>

<Text>Horrible experience!  Too bad I can’t give them zero stars! I don’t know how they did it, but they were able to insert their pop-up application for insurance into my lease application right where the lease talked about insurance. I just thought it was part of my lease application. Later, I found out that First American had nothing to do with my landlord’s insurance. I called and canceled the insurance and they gave me a refund for part of what I had paid, but CONTINUED to bill my credit card. I realized what they did, and called my credit card company, and was refunded for the charges. I got a message from my credit card company asking me to contact the company again, in writing, to cancel. I wrote to First Am canceling the insurance and asked them to send me a written confirmation that it was canceled. I got a letter in the mail from First American saying that they canceled my policy due to NON PAYMENT. I’m not sure how that will affect my credit, but I intend to file a BBB complaint.<//Text>< pics>

<review>I wish I could give them 0 stars. It has been 2 weeks that I am trying to reach someone who works at the claims department. NOBODY PICKS UP THE PHONE. Before I was getting insurance, I read the reviews here and I was thinking how bad could it be and chose these guys because they were cheap. DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE BECAUSE WHEN YOU NEED THE INSURANCE, THEY ARE NOT THERE. THERE IS NOBODY TO TALK TO. THEY DEMOLISHED MY HOUSE AND LEFT AND NO NEWS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY, CAN'T REACH ANYBODY TO TALK TO.

AGAIN DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE, DO NOT BUY THEIR INSURANCE.</review><Date>1578599492909</Date><username>Charlie Cinar< /username>< user>

Horrible insurance company. BEWARE DO NOT USE THEM. They will not answer your calls or return your calls. I have been displaced from my home due to a water leak downstairs. I have no kitchen or bathroom and no one from the insurance company will help moving the claim along..  I sent estimates, a bill from the restoration company. Etc. My kids are having a hard time getting back and forth to school because I work and I am way on the other side of town and cant take them.

At this point I am going to contact my lawyer. This is beyond emotional distress..

No one from the claims department will pick up the phone or call back. You take my money every month but wont get back to me to fix the situation.

Beyond upset..<//Review>

This is a terrible insurance company & the website is still stuck in Bronze Age. I can log into my account but it won't let me make payment online. They have 2 of my cards on file & I told them to freely charge my card whenever a payment is due but still they kept sending me notice of warning and non-payment every other month. This is nonsense. I'm enrolled in autopay as far as I'm concerned. Please update your damn website & allow customers to make payment online.<//Text>

Terrible, me and my rental agency tried calling all day Friday and Monday and still no answer. My email sent out also had no answers even though it's 48 business hours now. Terrible customer service, terrible company. DO NOT GET INSURANCE FROM THIS COMPANY. I'm done dealing with this company for the same issue every year because they only make it a temp fix when I wanted a permanent fix by just adding my rental company on Additional Interest. It's like they can't read English or something.</text>

<text>I have First American for car insurance. I totaled my car in early January and now it's mid-March and the car loan has still not been payed off. My adjuster doesn't answer phone calls or emails, and I just found out that I have a new adjuster and no one bothered to tell me until I called to ask. I've been without a car for over 2 months and have paid over $600 in ride shares and rental cars. Absolutely ridiculous.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

My basement flooded over a month ago. I hired a mitigation company to start the work of getting the water out. They waited 2 weeks to send an adjuster out to my house. He came and was very unresponsive and said to talk with my insurance company about any questions. I have been trying to get a hold the insurance agent to see what is and isn't covered to start the work and still nothing! By far the worst insurance company I've ever dealt with.<//Review>

<text>They automatically renewed a renters insurance policy past my lease being up. The policy even stated that it ended the same day as my lease, so I had not idea that it would renew without me contacting them. So I paid for two months of coverage to a place I did not live. When I noticed the payments were still coming out, I notified them that I no longer lived there, thinking I could get a refund. But no, they said they could only back date the change in policy for 7 days, so I only got refunded for one of the two months where they were covering me in an apartment I did not live in.</text><pics>None< /pics><date>1568671283375<//date><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcdecfcde047b1:0xe6c1a669c8e46e9f</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Let me first say I have never used this company. I just bought a house and we were comparing quotes from our current insurance company who has all of our business, USAA and this company. First American’s quote is $808/yr. USAA is $1380/YR. I of course, decided to do some research and after reading all of these 1 star reviews and the lack of customer service this company provide, I will definitely not use them. The few 5 star reviews that I’ve seen seem to be from people who are perhaps paid to review companies and give 5 star feedback. Just click on each of their names and checkout all of their reviews. Their comments are 6 words or less. I’ll pay the extra $47 a month to use a reputable insurance company and where it won’t take me going to reviews for the VP of the company to read a negative review to finally get resolution. To the VP of First American, fix your business model, correct the issues you have with your customer service and empower your employees. It should not have to escalate to the VP for issues to be resolved.< /Review>< response>

<text>First American Property and Casualty has never tried to help me when filing claims. Their webpage for paying online is impossible to use. You will not get a confirmation of payment received and will have to chase them down the next day through their phone answering system. I’m looking around for a new company.</text>< pics>

<Text>Awful.  Had a claim and would go weeks between responses, despite the fact that the claim affected our only bathroom.  Apparently my original adjuster "took an extended leave of absence" and they didn't feel like letting anyone know.  The person who took up my claim in their absence was just as non-responsive.  Had to repeatedly contact management just to answer simple questions. Then after dragging out the claim for months, they dropped coverage for certain unrelated repairs that hadn't been done.  I did all but one repair, which I told them would get done as soon as the claim is resolved, but only robots work there or something.  Insane how unresponsive they are; even for an insurance company. I expected nothing and I'm still let down.<//Text>< Pictures>

Absolute worst insurance agency I have ever dealt with. Their website is a mess and they do not make it easy to contact anyone if you are having problems. Paying a little more per month for a different company is by FAR worth it!</Text>

Horrible horrible. If you actually need to make a claim, expect it to take an absurd amount of time. It's been over six weeks and they have not approved their independent insurance adjusters numbers. I have recieved no
responses from emails I have sent or phone messages I have left. Worst costomer service ever!!!!! If I could give negative stars I would. Don't  use this insurance company and if you're a current costomer find a new company asap, you do not want to deal with this sketchy company and their incompetent employees.< /review>

This is the first time that i had to initiate a claim and don't have a good feeling after reading all these horrible reviews.  I got this insurance through my loan officer and hence didn't do my research. I have a leakage in my basement bedroom floor and called to place a claim thinking i would get an immediate attention as this can flood the basement resulting in more damage which they will have to take care of. But instead i was told that someone will connect with me on Monday. It's already a bad start. I will add to this review once i get their service if i get it at all. Still hoping for the best!<//text>

This shady company automatically renew your policy without properly informing you or clarifying with you. After I requested a cancellation of my policy (which was supposed to be effective), the policy stayed active (which I found out months later)! Long story short, their policy is as bad as a scam.<//text>

<Review>We had a burst pipe in my kids bedroom. Bedroom is below kitchen.
Sheet rock was soggy and fell on my kids bed. So I called and started my claim June 4, 2019. Sent plumbers report and all pictures and documents by June 18th. Insurance adjuster (will not name) was on vacation from the 21st till the end of the month. Started working on my file July 1st. I will agree with other reviews...the communication is not good and could be better. Fixed the busted pipe. Was only $872 from Beacon Plumbing. Still waiting on a check so I am able to hire Servpro and get my kids room back together so he can move out of our room. Will update review with new one when this is all over.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

First American casualty company is the worst insurance company ever, I can’t get paid out and it’s been almost 2 years, my house flooded and got mold, and they don’t even want to finish paying ServPro for repairs or for my personal items. They deserve 0 stars, too bad I had to give them 1 to post<//Review>

Cancelled our policy after 15+ years for galvanized plumbing (which we had from the start) and bully breed dog. Inspector lied and said they consider the dogs temperament. My dog is almost 10 and slept on the couch almost the whole time she was there. Never even barked. Crappy company with very poor communication unless they need your payment.< /review>

If you can choose another insurance company, I would. This company must be very small and have a small staff. I’ve had a renters insurance policy with them for 5+ years and thankfully never had to file a claim until this summer. It has been one headache after another and it’s very hard to get ahold of anyone let alone a call back. Since I have never gone through something like this before I don’t have much experience but I definitely don’t enjoy feeling like I’m a burden just by calling to ask a few questions. I also haven’t enjoyed the lack of communication from our claims rep. and how I had to speak with his boss to even get our initial check. Now I’m waiting to hear about our replacement cost claim and getting ahold of anyone to speak about that has also been a pain. We just want to get our money and be able to purchase and pay for things we need to be whole again.</review>

I only wish there was less than 1 star ,,,,,I have  had a policy with this co. for a few years  .And I didn't receive a renewal notice so I called Customer service or A lack of customer service.  They were  very rude and acted like I was a bother or inconveniencing them by asking about my renewal. WELL YOU WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ANYMORE  ON  BOTH OF MY POLICY'S.

<gmapID>0x80dcdecfcde047b1:0xe6c1a669c8e46e9f<//gmapID><Review>ZERO STARS!! DO NOT RECOMMEND! My roommates bike got stolen from our garage. We went to the leasing office to let them know, we made a police report. Now we called our renters insurance company First American to make a claim. My roommate calls no answer, so he leaves a message. Gets a call back from Bridget the claims representative, saying she needs proof that my roommate is on the lease and that its Friday towards the end of her day and she will deal with it on Monday. Copy of the lease has been sent, Bridget calls back a week and a half later saying that my roommate is not covered under the policy I paid for. Now if there was an option to add my roommates name when i was signing up for a policy you'd think i'd had him, right?.. well there was no option. My policy clearly says the address we live in is insured. So my roommate tells the claim representative there was no option and her response was that we needed to call and have my roommate added. WHO KNEW!? I fight with her because that is ridiculous why ask for the lease if Bridget knew my roommate wasn't covered in the first place. Their policies are horrible and so is their customer service. How much could they possibly cover for a bike? $50? I canceled my policy before something seriously went missing or got damaged. They are only open so many hours a day and since I am 3 hours behind, the time difference makes it difficult. The only reason we went with this insurance company was because our leasing office recommended it. I already went to the leasing office and told them not to recommend this place to any other new tenants. I really hope this business crashes, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!< /Review>< Pictures>

This is an absolutely atrocious company! If you're looking for an insurance company that does not return calls, is extremely rude, and will do anything possible to get out of paying a claim, then this is the one you want. We ran around in circles for 4 months on a roof claim, which they then denied. Runaway as fast and far as you can!! No, faster and farther... I'm serious!

**To your response, no, I am not a customer with a different company and will not delete my review. Our policy was in my fiancée name, not mine; interesting that you supposedly found me though. Instead of making false claims, maybe you should focus your attention on building a better company with proper customer service.< /Review>

< Review>
Filed a ongoing leak claim since December of 2018, it's coming close to February yet I'm still waiting for my adjuster Dennis to call back. Direct calls always end up in voice mail, emails were totally ignored. Customer representatives were helpful unfortunately they are not able to assist me. Periodically I am routed to another adjuster Shelly, whom is rude and impatient.
I strongly discourage using this company for any type of insurance.</Review>

This insurance company is a first rate scam based insurance company that deals with property and casualty for Homes. They don’t honor Policy is held by their clients because all they care about is their bottom line. We have never had any homeowner insurance claim file with them had a massive leak due to a faulty part in a toilet and we are being held as if we did something wrong.<//Text>

First American is the worst company ever do not get them for insurance. They do not honor their contract or their claims there was a woman there named Martha who is a claims adjuster who is one of the worst people on the planet.

I had a supply line break in my bathroom flooding my house doing thousands of dollars of damage and she will not honor the claim she will not fix it she does not respond to calls you will call her and call her and email her over and over again and she will not respond 4 weeks she'll try to ignore you so there you don't have to fix your.

This one Martha should be fired she does not work with people she does not try to help this insurance company will not honor their contracts they will not fix your home you will give them money for nothing if something happens you will have to try to fix it yourself and scrounge for every last cent out of your savings just to fix your house.
Do not go with first American whatever you do.<//review>

<Text>Would give this horrendous company negative stars if I could. Had our policy cancelled because an “inspector” showed up, came inside my house, pet my dogs, told me how cute they were, and then (incorrectly) reported them as a restricted breed (pitbull), causing our policy to be cancelled. First off, neither of them are actually pitbulls, second off, what a stupid and outdated policy. Do your research on pitbulls and change your stupid policy about them. Your overall current company reviews should give you some very strong hints about the quality of “services” you provide. You are a shady company and you need to rethink your values.

My central air condition doesn't work correctly, I called the FA Insurance, There has been FIVE times the technician came over to try to fix it, however none of they found the real reason causing the problem. I tried to call FA again, then they tried to kick the ball out.
I am totally not satisfied with the service because it costs me so much time on it without a complete solution. I already took FOUR days off to stay at home for the repair, who will compensate this lost? Moreover, it significantly impact my work performance as my boss shows not happy about my absence for so many times in just one month. Also, the room temperature was so low at night in the last couple weeks, and my 2-year old child got sick due to the long loss of space heating. My child couldn’t go to day care for having a fever and my wife needed to take a day-off to take care of her.
If none of the technician can fix this problem, why they don't just replace a new one? That what the insurance should do!!

Such bad experience with First American!!</review>

DO NOT PURCHASE INSURANCE FROM THEM. It’s hard to get someone on the phone and the customer service line listed on their website. It took me an hour to get someone to cancel my policy. I had to call from three different phones and one of the lines kept telling me the office was closed at 9 AM on a Thursday.< /Text>

<Review>I would have rated this company with zero stars, if it had been an option.
Like others have written on many sites, my title company, First American Title, recommend First American Property when I was closing on my house. I called them three times after closing to try to add on earthquake Insurance since I live in Oregon. Never got a call back. So sent them a message via the website and just received the following one line message: Your policy is set to non-renew effective 9/09/2016 we are unable to offer a quote for renewal 9/09/2016.

I think a reason would have been nice to include with their statement. And when was I going to get the letter telling me that information?

I just called the First American and they said they don't insure mobile homes. Funny, but my home is stick built and had a First American inspector out here to verify it before they would grant the policy. I repeated that to the agent I was speaking with who said 'hold on' and hung up on me. Naturally, I called back and waited another 15 minutes on hold, but got another woman who told me I have a mobile home and they wouldn't insure it.  Then I decided to try another tactic and said, "well you insured it 10 months ago and  KNEW I had a stick built home then". Her answer was that I would have to prove it was stick built and hire an inspector, myself, to do so. They would not send another one out to correct their error.

Fire and smoke is currently spewing out my mouth, ears and nose I'm so angry. Feel very fortunate not to have had any claims with them. Total incompetence in every area. Would NEVER consider using them and discourage others to do so. Good luck with getting a claim paid when the customer service, inspections and basic administration seem to be in total chaos, or it's just a scam going on between the title company and the insurance company, which is what I'm leaning towards at this point. But no one usually reads these reviews until they've already had problems, unfortunately.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I had to get a different insurance policy due to a change with our HOA.  Sadly, this is the one my insurance broker gave me.  I had a plumbing leak that ruined my downstairs bathroom floors.  At the request of Dennis Grover, the insurance adjuster, I sent the plumbers bill.  He tells me I’m not covered because they don’t cover problems due to tree roots getting into the pipes.  So I ask where it says that in the policy.  Dead silence.  Still nothing after several weeks.  Time to renew my policy next week.  Won’t be this company!<//Review>

Apparently pitbulls are a prohibited breed? My dog is the sweetest most harmless animal. The guy that did our inspection even came in and played with my dog for a good 10 minutes without any hesitation. Absolutely DESPICABLE and DISGUSTING company.<//text>

MY opinion this company is a complete farce. The claim adjuster Dennis Grover will send you a specialist they say did they pay very well to deny your claim. They will not take any pictures do any report. Just send you about three pieces of paper that say we did not your kind because of some Ludacris reasons. I highly question the integrity of these so-called specialist they employed to come down and inspect your claim and rubber stamp you as denial rubber stamp you a denial. I have a multi unit complex insured through this company I intend to drop this company as fast as I can I'd rather pay more and get real insurance then this joke. And when you're all done Dennis Grover will say sorry we denied your claim. Is there anything else I can help you with? In his monotone voice he will say have a nice day. I really believe this man is a drone he has no common sense and is extremely impersonable<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Me and my mother been living in our home for 12 years we began to do some updates on the flooring and realized under the floor was water!! Called and made a claim!! I called the company the lady that I spoke to instructed me to call Servpro Servpro came out and detected that the house had mold they sent the report to the  Insurance company at this point there sure is coming since our American leak detection company the technician was at my home he said that he could not find a leak but in his report he said he was coming from the manifold!! Then the insurance company since our outside adjuster the adjuster tells me and my family there is no way we could have ever detected the leak!!Long story short the insurance company the denied the claim!!! The insurance company because it was a pre-existing leak they’re not going to cover it!! If I knew that the water was leaking I would have got a fix and would have never made a claim this is the worst insurance company ever they been taking my money for 12 years and when I called they was not help!! Don’t use this company And the customer service was the worst the adjuster would not return my phone call the supervisors would return my phone call just to give me an update on what’s going onThe lady from Servpro have to call me and tell me my claim has been denied and this company has not called me yet to tell me that!! Gordon Carl is the worse<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

If I could give "zero" stars I would.  Absolutely the worst service and coverage.  The adjusters are not competent and every time one has to deal with FAPCIG, they make you feel like a bottom feeder.  I will be changing insurance and reporting their inaction to the State Insurance Licensing Board.  Run.  Run fast....< /Text>

Worst insurance company ever. If I could not rate this company and give it a zero I would. I had called over a month ago and no one ever got back to me. I called again and still did not get resolved with denise, who never called back from a week prior. They denied my claim saying it was a maintance issue that has damaged my foundation of my house. It seems that is the excuse they are giving all these people who are submitting claims. Should have looked this company up before I even called them to get a good answer. Dont waste your money and time with this company it is not worth. I rather spend more money on a high quality insurance who really cares for homeowners property.supposedly another agent called me and gave me the same run around excuse that the other agent gave me. I am so flabbergasted that this company is coming up with excuses and not willing to help me. I'm about to call an attorney becauae I've been with this company for 10 yrs and when I need to fix something and they don't. Who ever has rhis insurqnxe get out because they won't cover it. PERIOD!!!!</Review>

Extremely bad customer service. Could not speak directly with claim's manager. Do not buy insurance from this company. To me, it is like a fraud, or scam company, since I paid my premium but never got the service I expected. Extremely hard to get in touch with anyone, even got hung up on when called, maybe because i don't speak good english. Felt like minority will be treated disrespectfully or just me. I will definitely avoid this company.</review>

A man came to my mom's house with a small child and said he talked to her on friday to come out and update her policy, he was taking pictures of the inside and outside, my mom called me and said, did you send someone to my house? I said no, put him on the phone, come to find out he went to the wrong house per the company, but my mom also said she didn't know anyone on her street with that name. hummm. They need to make sure they have the right house before they go looking around people's houses. He is lucky her pitbulls didn't get him.</Review>

. Here now in 2018  july 6 my husbands birthday, we had microburst.  high winds monsoons 114° plus degree weather in PHOENIX AZ 85009. that whole week was on and off again storms. So we called to put in a claim "our a.c stopped working". 1st adjuster said we had bird damage on roof saying to my husband "birds were pecking the shingles"... 2nd adjuster said . to my surprise as well as my husbands he said it was from 2010 hail storm.. luckily for us we were able to provide google pictures from 2010( no damage) 2012( no damage) and from 2014 ( no damage)... they were stuck on 2010..from my husbands birthday July 6 we were homeless.. fortunately  my parents took us in.  Me, my husband and my mother n law
on a breathing machine with COPD..We waited a few weeks and our lady of contact M. F is her initials. we kept calling and calling and calling.  FINALLY she answers. to our surprise we were told that our claim was under investigation... from her initial statement. to send out a quote for a. c replacement which we did. and the cheapest one at that. to being accused of trying ro pull a fast one.. well here goes my question if our a.c was broken in 2010 due to hail damage why would we wait 8 years later to call insurance. i like to see someone live 4 summer months with no a.c in phoenix let alone 8 years..hhmmm. . i see why its hard to trust a big insurance company when they take and take and take.. . i will NOT recommend  this insurance company EVER... we are out $8,000 that we dont have to finance through the lowest bid we originally sent first american property and casualty insurance company . wow. . and i am with alot of you when i say they dont deserve a star . i wonder if they have their own insurance or do they go to their competitors.. 28 days later we are back at home. Still trying to find resolution to this fiasco of an ordeal.. NOW THEY WONT EVEN ANSWER OR RETURN OUR CALLS....oh yeah 1 more thing. in this whole ordeal we found out we have hail damage on roof..
to our surprise guess what year they said it was from... google pictures dont lie .. if our a.c wasnt damaged in those previous pictures why would our roof be.. .wish i could share my pictures with you all so you guys can see 1st hand... first am ins company  do the right thing its not to late.9/21/2018  no need to take it to the next level of management.  after being be littled, lied to, and the stress of waiting for responses. we've decided to discontinue service with your misleading company .  you had every opportunity to address our concerns. out of the 3 or for ckaims we submitted to you we were denied all.. 1st time putting it in and this is what we get for doing the right thing.. Lesson learned on our behalf. i just hope the tragedy on the east coast doesnt have to deal with what your company put us through here in the summer of phoenix arizona... I hope poeple who need insurance for the floods and bad weather on the east coast get treated with dignity and respect... and not treated out of personall issues that your self centered staff brings to the work place.. your employee made it personal to denie our claim once we proved ger wrong... i cant believe u tried to put a bandaid  on our tragedy.  i thank GOD we are fortunate  to learn a valuable lesson. and walk away from this set back... No wonder  the better business bureau doesnt have First American Property and Casualty insurance as a recognized company through them..<//review>

I currently have this insurance company and I'm thinking about switching companies.... Me and my husbands wedding bands were stolen, which is well over $2000 and I am being told that I can only get 1500 towards my ring. I'm like really!!?? I put in my claims on August 8th and here it is Aug 29th and nothing has been done yet. I had to send pictures, etc. And now they are telling me I have fill out some form  and send i back. It's very frustrating!!  Not a bad company but  they just seem to take their time and not considerate of their clients.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>first american property and casualty  is a joke. they put me ,my wife and my mother through hell with their delayed responses .. only to be denied  on all 3 of my claims submitted monsoon season of july 2018... i showed them proof and weather statements and their response was dated back to 2010 hail damage. they then responded to our better business bureau complaint saying we have confused them with a home warranty company.. same name just about.. this company spent more money sending out so- called specialist,  one person said pigeons or birds were eating my shingles. ... i never heard of such thing.. i was once a professional and expert in pest control to hear such a thing made me laugh. then the second guy said what sounded exactly what our claim adjuster said word for word,,,, as if it was rehearsed about 2010 hail damage. mind you this is 2018. 8 freakin years later.!!!!! .I wish u guys can see my pictures. buyer BEWARE. our insuarnce claim adjuster Martha FloreZ took this matter personal and did not  take anything we said into perspective or consideration about the facts..the proof we had that contradicted to what she said was never mentioned. i hope that the east coast flood and hurricane and tropical storm victims never have to deal with this company. i hope the victims get treated with respect and dignity and be treated as victims of a tragedy instead of being persecuted and be littled .martha floreszzzz was our claims adjuster 1st phone call  was almost robotic. after that it was as if we were guilty of putting in our claim
never the less. we learned our lesson and stopped the torment and cancelled our policy..  They are not backed by the BBB. that there should say something about this insurance company.. .im glad im in a good place to handle this and not in dire straits.. i know there are people out there that barely can afford insurance.  i hope this does not happen to them or you... Buyer beware and do your research... Please document take CLEAR pictures and most important be careful how you state your claim. even though we are not experts if we mention something wrong or forget to mention something it will be as if you were lieing.. this company  does not care about you or your tragedy its about making money
plain and simple......</text>< Date>

The plumber cracked my porcelain sink trying to get old hardware off. Then he said he didn't do it and first American sided with him; even though I had a picture of the metal shavings from him torking on the corroded fixture which resulted in a crack stemming from the fixture location in the sink.<//review>

I wish I could give zero stars. Worst insurance company that you could use. I flooded due to a hurricane and they denied my claim. I had to wait 10 days before I could even speak with anyone, just to be denied. I was with them for 5 YEARS and the ONE TIME I EVER MADE A CLAIM, I was denied. DO NOT USE THEM. THEY AREN'T WORTH THE MONEY, THERE IS NO SECURITY! You have been warned.<//Review>

<Text>AWFUL. Everything about this company is awful. Stay far, far away. Our claim was handled poorly, only 20% of our damages were covered, our claims adjuster was impossible to get a hold of, and their customer service is beyond rude.

Have great rates and when the unfortunate time a claim had it be filed, it was handled orderly and with all the support, suggestion, and more than I could have asked for.

If it were possible to give this company and negataive star I certainly would. No one in their customer service department is the least bit personable. A representative told me that I opened my policy in my ex's name (how does one do that) and even though the cost of the policy was routinely deducted from my account, they wouldn't be able to send a refund check exclusively to me. Unwilling to do anything for me and even wanted to verify my forwarding address with my ex when I canceled the policy!<//Text>

No stars if I could. 15 years with this company, and they just let us know they will not renew our home policy. Our house is less than 1500 feet from a brush area. 1500 feet! Our house has not moved in the last 15 years. Neither has the brush. Took our money, bailing for a ridiculous reason.<//Text>

114 degrees in Phoenix and my mom, Melva White, and Janet Lewis are senior citizens and they have gone 15 days without air conditioning because First American Insurance is holding the part they need because it wasn't shipped right. Also their voice mail box is full so you can't get in touch with anyone. When you do get in touch they tell you "Next Week!" Then when next week comes they have an excuse not to pay for your air conditioning unit to be fixed!</Text>

(Translated by Google) This company is the worst they invent anything to deny you the damage conversion in my case the adjusted claims put in their report that a defect in a piece caused the damage and it does not cover me
I'm upset because I've been there for 4 weeks and no one is responsible, I'm going to cancel this policy and I think I'll have to fix the problem on my own
Stay away is the worst company

Esta compañía es la peor inventan cualquier cosa para negarte la convertura de daños  en mi caso el ajustado de reclamos puso en su informe que un defecto de una pieza causó el daño y no me cubre
Estoy molesto pues llevo 4 semanas y nadie se hace responsable  voy a cancelar esta póliza y creo que tendré que arreglar el problema por mi cuenta
Aléjense es la peor compañía< /review>

Si yo pudiera diera cero estrella. Me robaron mis pertenencias que estaban en un moving trailer en los estacionamientos de los departamentos donde recien me estaba mudando. Los ladrones se llevaron mis recibos en una caja que ellos robaron. . La aseguranza hizo llamadas a mi pidiendo descripcion detallada de cada articulo perdido. Horas y horas Yo estuve en llamadas de telefono. Despues mandaron un investigador independiente que hizo preguntas fuera de contexto. Este senor hacia muchas preguntas, Cuando yo contestaba estas, para mi sorpresa el tenia mas. Yo le preguntaba si aun sin recibos de compra de los articulos perdidos la aseguranza me iban a pagar mis perdidas y nunca me contestaron esa pregunta. Me canse de seguir y seguir gastando tiempo contestando preguntas y que finalmente me dijeran: lo siento si no tienes recibos no te puedo pagar tus perdidas<//review>< pictures>

I adore this spot! They serve first-rate dishes, their menu is rich, The chef in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The dishes are consistently fresh, the attitude towards the visitors  is efficient. I often go to  this restaurant and I was never disappointed. Highly recommended.</text>

This was a surprisingly good place to eat. Small place that we noticed when we were stopped at the light. We have had burritos and tacos, very tasty. We will continue to visit and try more of their menu.<//text>

<Text>Don’t like this place. I was eating at subway, seen the guy that is supposedly the owner go and harass people in the back. Also I tried the fish tacos and they are not good. Do not come here lol everything is way to expensive. Also I didn’t like how he was harassing the homeless lady in the back, casa gazacon is 1 star and over priced.<//Text>< Pictures>

You have to try their fish tacos make sure you order small order of refried beans on the side and extra red salsa, the "chile torreado" (sauteed yellow pepper) is free and if you're into spicy food this will tickle you taste buds and the rest of your internal organs<//review>

This place was highly rated on Yelp. I liked it but I would have liked it more if the food would have been spicy. I got the Chile Verde plate and it tasted great but needed some spice. We also ordered the huevos con chorizo. They were okay. We asked for milk for the coffee but they said they didn't have any.< /Text>

<text>So the first time sucked but for some reason I gave it a 2nd chance. I ordered a ceviche tostada to go and they didnt even give me a tostada. Weird. They're mediocre go to sabor baja or el paisa down the street for better mariscos and service. Unfortunately everywhere else was closed when I went or I would have never settled for this. The lady has a bad attitude for no reason by the way, I know they're going to read this and I know they're not going to change or care just thought I'd put this out there.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

The lady was very nice. Nevertheless I have to take back because my dress said xl but it fit like a small. I like the feel of these loose pants but I wish I bought these cool overalls. The last time I went I bought a dress and put back this cool jumpsuit that mostly in the clearance section.  They have some great deals.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Cool clothes, paintings,  earth rocks, jewelry,  and other interesting  random stuff. I can spend all day there looking at all the things they have there. I went there today to look for some gifts and Moi was the best at helping me pick stuff out! Very grateful for his help and advice.<//text><user>108632759949806111419< /user>< Resp>

I loved going in this store! Very Bohemian/hippy vibe. Interesting things to look at. Unfortunately I was so interested in the store itself I didn't bother to look at any price tags. Things ranging from clothing, beauty products, home decor and art.</review>

Poor customer service and the staff was extremely rude. Bought two pairs of unisex pants from here and both ripped after the first wash. Cool stuff to look at but definitely not worth the price or treatment.</review>

Even though the prices are steep, I still give Earthbound 5 stars because the quality of the merchandise is excellent and the store always smells so good.< /text>

<text>I've come here for many years.  Go for a walk, watch a pick up soccer game, watch a baseball game, or take your dog to the dog park.  Clean, plenty of free parking and lots of open space.  There are occasional coyotes near the forest as well as a creek.  The creek is shallow and a good place to allow your dog to play.  The path to the creek is near the fenced Soquel Creek Water station. Dogs are required to be on leash outside of the dog park and sometimes the sheriff comes down, but that is pretty rare.
The park is kid friendly though there are no play structures.  Let them run or play sports.  It's all fun.<//text>< user_name>

Nice park to take a walk, soccer park and baseball park. Tho baseball fields are ugly to play on. The back Parking is all dirt and everybody drives thru it like a freeway, dust everywhere. Dog park also. No bbq area.<//Text>

<Text>This park is very nice. Lots of friendly dogs. There's a big dog park and a small dog one. My dogs prefer to walk laps around the outside of the dog park where there's a nice little trail.</Text>< userid>

The polo fields have been part of my life since the late 70s. When it was just a field with a walk path around it.  Aptos Creek runs by one side of the park giving my friends and I another playground for teenage boys. Now the Polo Fields is a sports park with baseball fields and enormous grass fields creating multiple soccer fields. A BMX track, a exercise par course with a variety of physical tasks you perform at stations spread out along the walk path that spans the whole park. The Cabrillo Lions Club is very active there . Most of the many benches around the park were donated and installed by this wonderful group of volunteers. It's a perfect use of the land, also a beautiful well maintained park.</review>

<Text>I always take my dog to the Polo grounds dog park. She loves it and I've met some really wonderful people there. The dog's are well behaved overall and the owners are responsible.

< review>
Polo grounds park is fantastic to walk the dog on leash . The  path us .85mile and the other dogs are friendly.  Super place to play Soccer. Catalysts Soccer Camp during summer months are  wonderful for children to grow and develop under coaching supervision.  Catalysts soccer coaches
are highly trained coaches keyed to child development.  The weekly sessions are beneficial for your 6-14 yr old.
The dog park is typical.  Dusty dirt.
A wonderful park.
Five STARS.
No children's playground.
They built a brick and mortar bathroom facility
...5 stars.<//review>

Polo Grounds park has several different features: several soccer fields (where a lot of youth soccer games take place), tennis courts, a BMX track with crazy jumps, and a dog run. The main soccer field closest to the entrance has serious terrain problems, but the others are in good shape. The dog run is large and has two separate fenced-in areas, one for big dogs and one for small, each with dog-friendly water fountains and people-friendly chairs.</review>

A cute pump track for bicycles, softball, soccer fields, and a dog park! There's a walking trail around the rim of the whole place, but no jungle gym equipment. Porta potty is all you will find, and a couple drinking fountains.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x808e16675563348f:0xa5d33ef074f574d2<//Gmap_id><review>Big place with several different areas. Nice paths to walk around the perimeter of the park (which is a good place to walk the dog). There's also a dog park here, but it's weird - super deep tanbark that makes it difficult to walk for humans, and seems like it would be weird for the dogs to play fetch in all of that tanbark, too. Also seems like a lot of lame-o dog owners bring their dog to act however it wants, with no discipline involved. They basically come to sit on a bench and let the dog be a jerk to other dogs and who cares. Happens a lot here, unfortunately.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Well whoever corporate is. Please stop telling your employees to spray. It’s offensive.<//Text>< pics>

It’s smart that they have this place behind other dealership because they can offer better rate for customers. We drove far to get here and was kinda bumped out that the staff didn’t let us know before hand that the car was not ready to test drive. Luckily all worked out in the end. We came back to buy the car on the day they installed new tires. But we noticed the tire pressure error on the dash board only when we left. There was some hiccups here and there, but nonetheless staff are friendly and knowledgable. Overall, we’re satisfied with the condition of the car and the final price.<//Text>

He offered to honor the original price that was advertised, and I went in and bought the car today. Great deal, and my salesperson, Tony, was very helpful, not pushy, and a pleasure to work with. Thanks for fixing the issue!

I went in on 4/3 to test drive a used car listed at $17,600. I left around 1:30pm, and told my salesman I had a few other cars I was interested in driving. Later that day, I contacted my salesman to make an offer on the car, and he told me to come in Monday as offers must be made in-person and they were closed Sunday for Easter.

Monday comes around, and I called my salesman to make sure the vehicle is still in stock before I drive down. When I called to check availability, he tells me the price has increased from $17.6 to $20.3k — a $2700 difference. I told him I’d do the deal today for the $17.6k the car was listed at when I viewed it and when he had told me to come in on Monday to make the offer. The manager declined.</Text>< gmap_id>

Trash service. Don’t expect anyone to help you after they sell you a car. Anytime you call they transfer you to another department and that person is always busy. They won’t return your calls. The 60 day warranty on used vehicles is a joke. You will be better off literally anywhere else.

Also the guy josh who responds to these reviews just copy pasted the same response to every negative review. He doesn’t care and won’t take your call.</Text>

< Review>
This place has a small service office which gets crowed quickly. The time frame it takes to get work done on your car is usually more than is quoted . Getting through on the phone in the middle of the day takes time. You need to have patients if you take you car here. Hopefully all this has changed and the service department is better, but every time i have visited the place i have had issues. Because of that and the following I only give it 3 stars.
Several years ago I took my Chrysler 300C into their shop for service because my airbag light was on.  The service dept. had issues figuring out why this was happening and had to keep my car several days to do tests.  After paying the bill I got my car back and within a week the light came back on. I returned it to Lithia and this time they said they had to replace a wiring harness in the dash which they tore apart to find the issue. I kept calling for updates and was told a new wiring harness was ordered from the east coast so my car had to sit there until the dash was reassembled. After several days and several more calls to Lithia I found out the harness finally came in but was not the correct one. Lithia ordered a second one which again took a while to arrive. Long story short - (from what I was told from Lithia) the second one was also wrong so they decided to just dig into the dash and rewire the incorrect harness into place onto the correct terminals.
I'm not a mechanic or wiring expert but using something that is incorrect yet making it work doesn't set well with me.
If I recall correctly Lithia had my car over a month to try and repair it. My car was only a few years old at the time. They finally called to say it was ready but then said I needed 4 new tires.  After a month of not having it I believed them because I had forgotten how much tread was actually on the current ones. I'm guessing I could have driven away with my old tires but trusted Lithia for some reason. Those Continental Tires they installed lasted less than 2 years and I had to replace them with something better.
Since then my dash has had a bad rattle in it which drives me nuts eveytime i hit a bump, but do I go back to Lithia to allow them to tear my dash apart again and cause more rattles or just play the radio LOUDER. The loud radio has been my choice so far. I wish I could give a better rating to Lithia but I have not been happy with how things worked out for me and my car. On a side note, my A/C has never worked well since this incident either and I am sure it is directly related to this incident because it worked perfect prior to the wiring harness service Fiasco.
You might be luckier than I. Good luck if you decide to go there for service.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Took my Dodge there for the first time after moving to the area. Arrived early for my 8:30 appointment. Didn't hear another word until I prompted them 3.5 hours later, then was told I needed a new battery. OK. But I wasn't told they didn't actually have the battery, or when I might expect to get my car back. Didn't get out of there for another 2.5 hours. Got burned on the price, of course--not even the diagnostics were covered by my lifetime warranty. They would have been, I was told, if the tests had led to a covered repair. Huh? I expect to pay a premium at a dealership, but I also expect good communication and some consideration for my time.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Where to start with this circus of a dealership. Unfortunately  I’m limited by word count so I’ll skip straight to the dealership visit. Keep in mind I live 4 hours from the dealership. On the day of the test drive, I meet Tony who can’t seem to get my name right, referring to me as Nathan. Dealership was unwilling to negotiate, pointed me to the door, said they didn’t need my business and would rather auction the car off then take 300$ off the price. Said I was unwilling to meet them in the middle even though i drove 4 hours and offered more money down to get them to meet my price. Manager refused to see me, and only came out as I was leaving. Usually this is when the manager tries to smooth things over. Not this guy, he tells me he came out to say good by and that they couldn’t take 300$ off but would include a free oil change. I don’t even live there! Come to find out they lowered the price the next day to what I wanted. Unprofessional, shady, and petty to boot. Go anywhere else but here, you’ll only have regrets and wonder why you gave them the time of day.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1612824619272, 'text': 'Matthew,\n\nYour satisfaction is important to us and I would appreciate the chance to connect with you to learn more about what had happened during your experience.

<review>I took my Jeep to the Santa Rosa Jeep dealership to have it checked out. I wanted information on why it was making loud noises in the engine. I was not sure if I was going to get it fixed or not due to not knowing what the problem was and how much it would cost. When bringing it in and asking for a diagnostic test. I told them that I wasn't sure if I can have it fixed or just getting an opinion of what the issue was, the person in return became rude and frustrated towards me. When receiving the report I realized they didn't even give me any information I didn't already know. They said there was a noise in the bottom of the engine, that is what I told them when bringing it in. They didn't have anything to say about the situation and held my car tell I paid them for nothing. Of course I had to do the right thing and pay them but I'm writing this review to help others not get bad service from Jeep. I will never take my Jeep to this dealership ever again.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>1</Rate><Time>1618253025904</Time><resp>{'time': 1618354933330, 'text': 'Lourisa,\n\nWe take your feedback seriously and would like to speak with you to better address your recent service experience.

I had a 2012 Infiniti g37s I located I found thru Carfax at this dealer. Once I expressed my interest in this car I received a call from a salesman named Luca was very attentive and showed me the respect I deserved as a potential customer!!!! He exhibited a level of professionalism that far surpassed his age he was very informative experienced and responsive to my needs also Buddy the finance manager and the finance team that he led or extremely efficient and also compassionate in their need to make Lithia a dealership it would be a force to be reckoned with I would recommend this dealership to my own family or any other people that wouldn't stop long enough to listen as this is the best experience I've ever had in a car dealership in my life there's one place to go if you need a car Lithia motors they are the best in my eyes and nobody ever convinced me of that the car that I ended up buying has been immaculate so far not one thing is wrong with it and they were crystal clear in the contract there was no confusion or misunderstandings that you would expect in a car dealer I would by far recommend this dealer if you're looking for a car you be hard-pressed to be able to find one this good anywhere in this USA!!!!!!!!<//Review>

<review>You turned a 5 star customer into a 1 star customer.

I had a service with you guys a few months ago and it went well, no issues at all.

Now i tried to schedule another one and i had to call 4 times before i got someone to answer the phone as noone was responding to my voicemails. They guy that did answer the phone acted as if he couldnt care less whether i came in or not. So i told him id take my business elsewhere. Not a very good way to run a business, and I’m not sure what happened since the last time i was there.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I purchased a 2010 Jeep Wrangler from them. I was on a time restraint due to needing to get to work. I had emailed them with an offer, and then the sales team called me as I was driving to there location. I explained that I was on my way, but didn't have time to haggle over the price. Upon arrival we were met by the friendly sales staff. Then we test drove the Jeep, and decided to make the purchase. Lara did a great job in showing, and getting the paperwork finalized with the price that was already worked out in advance. It was a real pleasure meeting and working with this staff. They didn't try to bet us to death with the pricing. I felt that this purchase was a win win for both parties. Keep up the good work. Yes, I did make it to work on time, and thank you.< /Text>

<Review>The salesman, Anthony Vangeli was good.  However, he stated that they could not do online sales, sales over the phone, or deliveries due to corporate policy.  During COVID this is quite strange, there are Lithia locations that do all of these services, these services are advertised on Chrysler's corporate website, and we are in a pandemic.  Nevertheless, since this dealership is 400 miles away from my home, I flew up, rented a car, and drove to the dealership after I had confirmed, by appointment, I would be there between 9-10am.  I called Anthony at 9am, letting him know I would be there at 9:15, and reminded him of all of the deal points we had previously discussed the day before over the phone (including the discounts, rebates, and APR loan I had been pre-approved for).  When I arrived, he stated that his finance manager, was not yet on site, so there would be a delay, but we should be able to wrap things up in under 2 hours.  To be expected the deal we had discussed was not "coming up" as available with the Chrysler Capital financing, but one at a higher APR was available.  I was then introduced to the finance manager at 11am Buddy Shalagin to close the deal.  Instead of reviewing anything about the deal I had negotiated with Anthony, he started having me sign DMV paperwork, insurance paperwork, the normal forms for purchase of title.  When we got to the actual contract, I told him that there were several other financing offers available that weren't, "coming up" that I preferred over the higher interest rate offer that they were pushing.  After I showed Buddy the offers from their own website, emailed him a screen shot of the APR I wanted, he still wouldn't offer me the advertised rate, instead asking me how long I would go before I would pay the loan off anyway.  After I insisted on the advertised rate, showed him on his computer how to get to the offer on their website, he finally relented.  I signed the contract and then left to drop off my rental car.  I came back to gather my belongings, say goodbye to my salesman, and here comes Buddy Shalagin, asking me to sign another document, stating that I had got, "Employee Pricing".  I refused and he kept trying to show me the invoice and asking me to sign that I had received an additional discount.< /Review>< Time>

They Brooke my windshield while installing a rear view mirror and didn’t tell me. I noticed 20 min after I left. Then they would only replace the windshield  with an after market windshield even though the one they broke was a Dodge Windshield!!! Pretty strange for a Dodge dealership! I would never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever go back there again!!! I will never buy a car from them!</Text>

< Review>
EVERYTHING!!! I was promptly greeted upon arrival. The dealership itself was very welcoming. I didn't feel uncomfortable or out of place. All of the sales associates looked excited and happy to be there. I initially dealt with Rick the sales manager however, on the day of purchase, he was unavailable. He put me in contact with another manager there, Josh, who didn't hesitate to help me. Josh was very upfront and professional!!! Although, the name of the game is selling cars I was impressed by his level of customer service. Instead of pushing me to buy a vehicle he was very concerned with finding the right vehicle and making sure that, regardless, I would be happy with the car buying experience. Which I definitely was. Also, David in financing made the last part comfortable and easy. If I didn't understand something he had no problem going back and explaining it. He made sure that I understood the packages available to me. I've been to a lot of dealerships and this is my 4th car. My experience at Lithia Santa Rosa was by far the best experience I've ever had. I will make the 2hr drive again and tell my friends!< /Review>

<text>Nick in service went above and beyond getting our 2021 Jeep gladiator fixed. We went to the dealer in Petaluma they said the problem was a design flaw. However Nick tracked down the issue for us and got the items replaced under warranty. We’ve ended up taking our Abarth Spider there as well. Lithia Nick is an asset!

Steve was competitive and professional, something I look for in a salesman. Very punctual and kept to his word. Personally, I have had some bad experiences with Lithia but, let’s face it, their prices beat most, which lured me and others in.
From listing to purchase,  the process was smooth and rewarding (not what I’m used to) and I’m thankful. Appreciate the “revamp” and am glad with my purchase!<//review>

<review>We had a good experience with the sales department but two poor experiences with the service department. We bought a new Rubicon, had larger tires & wheels installed elsewhere, and brought it back to the dealership to have a lift kit installed. We asked them to be careful with the new wheels but every one had nicks because they didn’t use sleeves when taking the tires on/off. They did a good job with the lift, and we didn’t make a big deal about the wheels because we know it can happen if you aren’t careful. We did ask them to adjust the speedometer for the larger tire size and they said they were unable to do that. Last week we went in for our first oil change and asked them to adjust the headlights down because of the lift (everyone flashing their lights at us). When we picked it up they said the technician said he can’t adjust the lights. We asked to clarify why, and the service rep said, “If my technician says we can’t do it we can’t do it. Besides we aren’t making any money on this anyway.” So .. we were disgusted, called another shop and had it handled, but to bring $$ into it when we bought a new vehicle and $3500 for a lift .. taking them up on a first “free” oil change and asking for a headlight adjustment doesn’t seem like a lot to ask. We left a VM for the service manager Friday but no callback yet .. disappointed.</review>< Pics>

As a result of the oil leak the undercarriage of my truck was all covered with motor oil. When I took my truck to fix the oil leak plus two recalls I asked Nick, a Service Adviser, to also add a screw to my rear license plate and also clean off the oil spill. He promised to do just that. When I picked up the truck the Service Advisor Reno (perhaps a misspelled the name, apologies) said that all was done. It was not. Neither was the license plate screwed on, nor the oil spill cleaned up. I asked Reno to finish the job as per the prior promises. He refused and turned away.  They just made thousands of dollars worth of my business and refused to spend 30 sec on cleaning off the oil. Their service sucks. I can not trust them anymore and will not give them a cent of my business again. What a looser! Classic definition of it!< /Text>

<Review>Friendly towards people and dogs, which was great while I waited with one of my dogs when the truck was being serviced. Can be a little lengthy of a wait, can be a little pricey, but they do offer you package options to choose from for your services explaining whats included in each which allows flexibility on overall cost. Appt was easy enough to make less than a week ahead over the phone and Renaud our service advisor for our appt, was very kind and helpful, personally topping off my window washer solvent which was one detail overlooked.
Overall pretty easy, will keep bringing my truck here, thank you.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I typically avoid super negative reviews especially in a time where everyone is hurting economically (I never wanna hurt someone's ability to earn), however Lithia has truly earned this negative review. I urge everyone to spend their hard-earned money anywhere else but here. This was my wife's first car purchase, and it ended up being a complete disaster and ruined something that was supposed to be a fun memory. Lithia doesn't have ANY respect for you or your time. Below is the our experience at Lithia:

Purchased a used vehicle from Lithia along with an additional warranty through the dealer. The buying process was so bad and screwed up that the salesperson apparently ended up getting fired, though it was not at our request or insistence as we'd never want someone to lose their job because of us (though we were treated horribly by him). Everyone's hurting these days and the last thing we woudl want is someone to lose their job. Anyways, the salesperson had promised us full car detailing after purchase though when we dropped off the car he hadn't remembered to schedule and didn't notify us and discourse became blatantly unprofessional and juvenile to a point that we had to walk away from him and deal directly with the Manager. At this point the dealership realized they made a huge mistake during our transaction and almost didn't let us take our car home, though after getting on the phone with our insurance agency we ended up having to purchase additional insurance which was not explained to us during our purchase, and we were "allowed" to take our newly purchased car home, though not before scheduling a car detailing appt with Litha. A few days later we dropped off the car for a SECOND time for its detailing, picked it up a day later, and they had washed the car without touching the interior. I addressed this with the Manager who gave us an excuse that this hadn't been disclosed to him, though at this point I caved into his excuse and ended up bringing my car home as I didn't want to have to come back a 3rd time.

A month after purchase we had a problem with the car and brought it back on a Friday (fully within the 60 day window). The maintenance department told us to drop our car off at another dealership for repair, forgot to schedule the repair (though told us they did), and did not supply us a backup car. My wife found out today that the Litha Service dept lied to us about contacting the other dealership for said repair. This process wouldn't be as awful if it weren't for the horrible attitudes and lack of professionalism of almost every person we've dealt with (though the Manager didn't honor the original promise from the salesman, he was at least friendly and not abrasive).

I welcome anyone at Lithia who would like to dispute this review or try and justify their actions. There's not much you can do to rectify this experience for us, but I certainly hope you use this example to improve your dealership.<//review>

<review>Drove almost 100 miles with cash in hand and a good trade to purchase a car. We were asked to wait as there was a potential customer already trying to purchase the car, but we waited in our car for almost an hour to just turn around and go home. They don’t take debit or credit card, must have cash or check and after waiting so long banks were about to close and they had not even started a process of looking at our trade in to give us an offer. Meanwhile they were working with people who they told us were very unlikely to qualify for the purchase. Very frustrating and poor customer service. Would not recommend.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I continue to get my car serviced here because of their excellent, efficient, and affordable service. I tried taking my car into another shop since I moved out of the area. Because my experience at Lithia was so great, I made the trip back up here to take it in. They were able to resolve several issues that the other place couldn’t. I feel like I can trust these guys and I will continue to bring my car in here. My car is always running smoothly after I bring it here. They also take the proper Covid precautions which is important these days. A special thanks to Nick S. in the service department for being my go-to. He is always accommodating, highly responsive and professional.<//Review>

<Review>I took my vehicle to the service department to get worked on. The truck is under warranty and should have been an easy situation. Instead they led me on saying the wrong part showed up and made me wait two months to get it back. The service department is terribly rude and untrustworthy. When getting my vehicle back my steering wheel was upside down the alignment was so off. Also there were and still are several things missing from my vehicle including a yeti h20 bottle and several tools. When I asked the manager about the missing items he stated that "there has been no break ins so its not possible" and wouldnt hear another word. They stole and lied to me and did a terrible job at doing their job. Which is supposed to be fixing vehicles. Instead of servicing the service department will steal your belongings and lie to you. Do not go here for business.</Review>< pictures>

Wonderful experience.  Ryan was very honest and knowledgeable during the process.  I had done a ton of research and test drove many different trucks.  I was even willing to drive out of state for the best price.  Lithia was able to make this happen right here at home.  Thank you.</review>

Came in for a service on my truck. At first they were nice until I didn't get any extra recommended work done on my vehicle. They held my truck for a whole day more just because of that reason. A total of three days. When I came in to get my truck they weren't as friendly as my first encounter. They rushed me out the door to wait for my vehicle after I paid over 1050$ for my service. I waited more than 45 min before they finally brought my truck to me. when I got my truck back it sounds two times worse than when I brought it in. I'm very disappointed.ive only driven it 6 min away and have had burning oil smell almost the whole way. Also I noticed all this dirt and white chalky stuff from their feet tracked all over my car. I might have had better service elsewhere.< /Text>

Hands down the worst experience I've had with a car dealership!

Brought my Jeep in for a diagnosis because the check engine light came on.  They told me they needed to replace a cylinoid in my transmission but they needed to order the part.  They instructed me to return Friday, two days later with a specific quote.

I dropped off my car Friday at 8 am.  Had to call and follow up after noon only to find out that they ordered the wrong part and that it was $200 more!  They also said that they were unable to work on my car until Tuesday.  I asked if they provided loaner cars since I had a follow up with my surgeon for my broken ankle the following Monday morning but they told me they only had rentals for $35/day.  After pointing out that I probably wouldn't need it if they ordered the right part from the diagnosis that their dealership did, Nick, the employee that was helping me, consulted with his manager and after two hours called me back and offered me what seemed to be a free rental.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any cars available for me to drive and they couldn't exactly determine when one would be available.

My partner brought his car to Manly, down the street, the week before and was OFFERED a loaner car since they had to keep his car overnight.  He didn't need to ask for one.  It was part of their service.  But I digress..

I decided to pick up my Jeep so I can drive myself to my doctor's appointment on Monday.

I expressed my disappointment to Nick about my experience with their customer service (i.e., ordering the wrong part even though they diagnosed it and then subsequently giving me a higher quote) but instead of acknowledging their mistake and offering an apology, he took my complaints personally and defensively asserted that I was attacking him.  I clarified and told him that I was referring to my overall experience with his company and that I wasn't attacking him personally.  At this point, he stared me down and pulled down his face mask (because of COVID) and told me that my keys were ready.  Obviously trying to intimidate me.  No apology, no acknowledgment of their mistake, nothing!

This dealership obviously lacks integrity and they don't train their employees to interact with customers professionally.  Disappointing to say the least!  I definitely won't be going back there nor would I recommend any one else to take their cars there for service.< /text>

Colby in sales was 5+ stars. He was great! The service department was awful! Yes service 2 days after purchase. I left not knowing who to talk to about issues with the car and a dirty car filled with dog hair. The service guy was a rude A Hole.
I do not recommend Lithia for the service experience alone. Too bad Colby wasn't at a different dealership that would boost his sales.< /Review>

<text>Worst service possible. I had my truck towed there for work my car insurance would pay for. They kept the truck for 2 weeks and never answered when I or my insurance called. They never returned any messages or emails. We finally got the sales department to answer, but service still took 2 days to call back and then didn't follow through on getting us an estimate. We ended up having to tow the truck to the Ram Dealership in Marin (who fixed the truck in 2 days). When we picked up the truck from Lithia they had the gall to charge us for the diagnosis. Take your truck to South County Dodge in Marin. Don't waste your time with Lithia.< /text>< rating>

One of the worst places I've been to to buy a car, typical salespeople who will bend the truth and don't care about wether or not you're able to make the payments. Tried to intimidate with a cocky salesman and offered less than half as much for my trade in that I got somewhere else. Very happy I walked away.</Review>

I bought a car from here recently and at no time during the purchase or test drive did they mention or disclose verbally or in writing that the key fob was broken.  When I called the next day to ask about it and explain that it was very questionable sales tactic I was basically told that it was too bad, that is how the car came even though it has a warranty on it!  I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was too busy to talk to me because he had 3 deals going on.  Once they got my cash all the sweet talk and customer service went right out the window.  It is $400 to replace the fob!!!!! I already asked around at different REPUTABLE dealerships.  To add insult to injury, when they sent me on my way after the sale (before I knew about the fob) they gave me the car with a completely empty gas tank.  That is just so cheesy and low class.  Especially since it was extremely dark, pouring rain AND they knew I lived over an hours drive away.  Unbelievable!  So far the car runs fine but if I have a problem with it I know what they will likely say! TOO BAD</Review>

I have been calling them for a week now. Left messages, emails and still no call back. This is ridiculous. Worst customer service i have ever delt with. Please dont go to this dealership. You will not be happy with them. If they would just answer there phone. Called to talk to a manager and still can not get through to talk to someone. I repeat. This dealership is the worst i have ever delt with.< /review>

<text>Last June I bought a really cool Jeep Cherokee Trail Hawk from Ford for my birthday.  However they "forgot to mention" the previous owner NEVER had the scheduled maintenance done at 30 and 60 thousand miles.  So when I received a recall notice in the mail, Ford directed me to Lithia CDJRF for both the maintenance and recall repair.  Tim my service advisor, was not only very helpful to accommodate my schedule, he also did what he could to help keep the cost within my budget ensuring that I was able to get all the repairs completed.  This is the first auto shop that has ever helped me in that way.  Thank You Lithia and Tim for such excellent customer service.</text>< Pics>

Horrible experience. Sold me a NEW truck that needed an air noise fix in the dash. They tried to "fixed" it and then didn't put the dash in properly. Came back to have them tried to fixed it again and the tech said they might not be able to correct it. They are a bunch of incompetent people (sales and service). Lucky they offer me a FREE car wash, in which I declined. Truck is still not fixed. Jeff Fox never called me back about my issue<//Text>

I went in with my husband today in hopes to test drive and possibly purchase a wrangler. I had been speaking with Sarah and Ashley through email whom were LOVELY. They are the only reason I am not saying 0 stars.But as soon as my husband and I drove up, a man (whom didn’t bother to give us his name) asked who we were looking for? Versus asking what he could help us with today.. we are latino/ Hispanic and though felt his initial greet was strange we shook it off and continued and mentioned the car we were interested in, and he looked at me confused but asked details and found the car and took us to see it. This man seemed uninterested and unmotivated to help us, we made clear we wanted to test drive the car and he seemed hesitant and annoyed when I asked if it was possible for us to test drive it. Eventually once in we gave him some information on my car we would be interested in trading in and kid you not he took out a calculator and punched in a few numbers and showed us what our payments would look like in a way that made it seem like we could never afford it. He did not even bother to run our credit, or verify any information or even just try to work with us in any way whatsoever. The audacity of this mans demeanor insinuating such a thing was extremely unprofessional, rude, and just unacceptable. We are still interested, willing and motivated to purchase the car we had to beg to test drive today and will get it but NOT at Lithia. **reposted on Facebook page**<//review>

Being in business can be a tough challenge at times...I know we all have to make a living...First, I hope this picture got your attention to read the whole story and give me your opinion...There are times in my business when i have to decide to give time away...no charge if i couldn't fix your car...

I have a customer with a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee (40k miles) and a leaking transfer case...I figured it was under warranty, so I was gonna help out my customer by taking it to the dealer...The dealer looked at it and said the transfer case had already been replaced with a factory rebuilt, but not by a dealer...so it wasn't under warranty....the charge $165.00, just to look at it and tell me this...no REAL diagnosis or repair done...$165.00 just to look....I COULD NEVER DO THAT TO ONE OF MY CUSTOMERS AND SLEEP AT NIGHT....I feel violated!!< /Text>

<Review>I don't even know why we stopped here.  I should know better.   We walked all around the lot and looked at everything, spent a bit of time around the $60k trucks we were interested in and no one said a word to us. That's not so bad,  don't necessarily want pushy salespeople hounding you.  But standing and waiting for 10 minutes IN the showroom and no one says a word to you is another thing.

Don't get me started on the service department.  It takes all day to get an oil change.  No exaggeration.  I literally dropped our truck off before they opened and had to wait around after hours when I picked it up because it wasn't done yet.

Just avoid this place is the best advice you'll get.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Customer service and communication by the  entire staff (most notably, Nicholas Cuevas) was outstanding throughout the entire process. This was especially welcomed and appreciated by me as I had been in contact with all Chrysler/Dodge/Fiat dealers in the greater Bay Area looking for a lease deal on the 500e and experienced very poor customer service and/or lack of communication from the other dealers.

Even though South County of Marin was the only dealer advertising a lease special on the 500e, they were very difficult to work with as their ability to communicate with me was lacking. On the contrary, Lithia in Santa Rosa kept me in the loop without hounding me and even honored South County's advertised offer.

I could not possibly appreciate the professional, patient, and courteous customer service provided by Lithia Santa Rosa any more than I do. A truly great experience. If you are looking to purchase a new or used car, you should make this your very first stop and ask for Nico, he and this dealership will take good care of you!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>My first experience with Lithia after the Jeep place in Marin closed.  Had a regularly scheduled oil change and check-over on my 2017 Wrangler.   Everything was great!  Easy to schedule, easy and friendly to work with Kyle in Service, work done relatively quickly - just enough time to drink a cup of coffee and check-out the 2018 model in the showroom.  A quick hose-down of the dust and clean windshield would have earned 5 stars.  Maybe after the remodel.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1518797098001, 'text': 'Thank you for the feedback! We appreciate your business and review greatly!'}</response>< GmapID>

I have found not all "salesmen" tell you want you want to hear but rather what we can do together to make this a very pleasant purchase. I left the dealership feeling empowered rather then exhausted.

Got what I consider a great deal on a new Ram truck. It's a dealership so buyer beware and do your research. They're in business to make money. That said the staff is friendly and professional. They took care of a warranty repair quickly. No complaints.<//Text>

<review>My family and I have purchased 4 vehicle from here in the last 3yrs, I'm quite ashamed to say. Three out of the 4 have been extremely unpleasant. I regret to say that we literally have to chase them around, in the sales department as well as the service department. Not to say when it comes to selling a vehicle they are looking for no one else but their best interest, and if not they truly show other wise with there actions.  I now have started to bring in a Ram 2500 Truck to get serviced, and it has been nothing but a head ache. I tend to get quite a bit of lies or misleading information from most of the reps here.
Just this last service that was scheduled at 7:30, for 3 recalls and an oil change was the icing on the cake. I called Monday to schedule the appointment for Thursday10/11/2018, that Monday when I called I was told that all 3 recalls where able to get done in this appointment Thursday. When I arrived I was helped by a gentle men that surprised to say was pretty helpful. He mentioned that one of the recalls wasn't able to be done so I would get a call "1-2 weeks, maybe even tomorrow."
Once the other 2 recalls where done, I requested to look at the water pump that was replaced, when the gentleman brought in the removed water pump his words exactly where " I'm pretty sure it's this one, they do a lot of water pumps so they are pretty sure this is it."
If you know about recalls you can see how this is a bit disappointing to hear...
*I would love a follow up from LITHIA, them self, these are the people that are representing your name, I would really love to see something done about this kind of customer service.
This  is truly unfortunate, not to say that while there I did see 2 other extremely happy customers, which as you can understand is quite disappointing!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

However the sticker on my window said differently. A wk later the oil alarm light was on. When we checked the level the car had no oil. That damage can cost thousands of dollars. That also means Lithia people never even looked at the level. That’s negligence and total lack of professionalism. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere where at least they look at your car.

Had such a great experience shopping and buying a vehicle here. From Angel my sales guy all the way up to the finance manager. Angel wasn't pushy at all stayed focused on our needs and got us a vehicle that met all our needs for under what we were willing to spend. This has never happened anywhere else.

<review>UDATE:  Kudos to Nathan for following through and making a solid effort to accommodate me... we still disagree, but  I think I'm just disagreeing with the way they do business and how the service industry works these days (and that ain't his fault).

very disappointed - brought it in four times in about 6 weeks, each time they charged a "diagnosis fee" and missed all these un-related problems?  I feel ripped-off.<//review>< rating>

<text>After several poor experiences with dealerships in the Bay Area, I can finally say this was an exceptional experience.  I worked with Craig N. over email and the phone to work out a price.  When I received a better quote from another dealership, Craig and his sales manager Rick, matched the price.  I drove in to the dealership, test drove the vehicle and signed the paperwork!  Excellent team at Lithia Santa Rosa.  Everyone was kind and helpful.  I will recommend them to anyone who wants to purchase a vehicle.< /text>< Resp>

First of all. Zach at front desk on service dept. Offered to do a complimentary oil change after i was going to be charged $160 to regen my truck. Then he just denied saying i never said that. He menrioned like 3 three times. I would like a call from the his supervisor please. Awfull service. Phone is never answered. Then you are on hold for 15 min. Truck has 11k and warranty covers nothing. I called warranty dept and was told the opposite. They tried to contact dealership but were never answered. I called dealership again and gave them cade number but apparently they never called!
DO NNOT GO THERE! GO TO PETALUMA INSTEAD! BELIEVE ME, DONT DO IT!<//Text>

My 2015 Wrangler Unlimited would not start, even after trying to jump it repeatedly. I got my car towed to the front of the dealership but as it was 11pm the gates were closed and I had to have it street parked. The next day when I went in the team at the dealership pushed my Jeep into the service area and were able to determine that, of all things, the security chip in my key had been deprogrammed and just needed to be reprogrammed. Their communication with me throughout the process was great and I was able to pick up my car the next day with no issues. Thanks for a streamlined experience!<//review>

<text>I have been impressed with the service provided at Lithia since we purchased our Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2014.  Through all of the recalls and little issues with our Jeep they have been courteous and willing to make necessary repairs.  We are always treated with courtesy and respect, and the estimates we receive are reasonable and are held to.  Part of the reason I love my car is because I have been able to work with a fine service organization to maintain it.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I am a Jeep lover! I have been in the process of purchasing a Jeep Wrangler for 2 years (Been saving, researching for the right one, contemplating when the right time would be, etc.) I looked online and... Bingo! I found the ideal Wrangler I wanted. I went to Lithia, even made an appointment, and I had to call the dealership that I was outside, because the salesmen were simply walking by not asking me if I needed assistance. Someone, finally came out, and I must say he was really nice. Everything from that point one was great. I had two people helping me, offered me water, soda, etc. Done deal, I got my dream car! 2017 Jeep Wrangler! I was driving it around everywhere! I was promised a detail to my car, but I never got a follow-up call, because the day I purchased my car the detail shop was closed. So, I called 4 days later to make my appointment. I was able to drop it off before I head to work, and then I was to able to pick up my Jeep when I got off work. Perfect! Had my mom pick me up so she can drop me off work, left my truck IN PERFECT CONDITIONS, then about 1 1/2 later I get a call that my car doesn't turn on and they don't know why. I was shocked! They said, "Well, this is strange we will figure it out". Then they called me again about 4 hours later still saying that my car still not turning on, and if I can bring the extra key. I had to get a rental car from there, which is fine, but it is not my car! I AM FRUSTERATED!!!!!  I have been calling for updates, they called me twice, I don't have my car, I sadly enough only enjoyed my new car 7 days, and how is it that being a Jeep shop they are having a difficult time trying to diagnose my car! It is 11 days later, and I am still driving around my rental. Sorry, I wish I can leave an awesome review, but sadly enough I cannot do that!< /text>

I went in knowing exactly the car I wanted and was able to get it.  The team that helped me was professional and courteous and that was very important to me.  The sales person, Nicholas Cuevas, really worked to get me a deal I could live with (I left once not expecting to go back and then returned). The only reason I didn't give them a 5star rating is because of the low-ball figure I got for my used 2013 FIAT 500, which only had 36,000 miles on it.  Only after I got a higher offer from CARMAX across the street did they got up a bit but still not as much as the CARMAX offer.  I still traded in my vehicle because it was worth it to me not to have to sell it myself.  I highly recommend them!< /text>

<Text>Experienced many barriers to completing repair on our truck, excessive hold times, no call back or text as promised, don't bother recommending speaking to the service manager he observed our experience and avoided eye contact with us. Strongly recommend avoiding business with this dealership & service department.
Update:  I recieved a response from the initial review requesting I call Lithia again. We where scheduled to come in for installation of a part. During the phone call I was assured our challenges would be addressed. Upon arrival after waiting to speak to the service writer we were informed we should not have come in the service writer was going to call us when the part came in. We asked if he could see if the part was in. We waited some more while the service writer checked to see if the part was in & spoke to his manager for some time, the service writer was visibly annoyed with us & his conversation was full of comments chastising us, very unpleasant. The part was in it was installed, they didn't look at what we thought the issue was.

The employees who work here display a general resentment toward the customers who come into the establishment. Two salesman were standing outside, smacking each other with a balloon, and kept themselves busy with this activity during our visit. Employees walk out look at customers & walk away without speaking. When employees do speak you have to listen to how short staffed they are and other problems they are having. There aren't many Lithia dealerships to recieve service so we are stuck going for now. But think twice before committing to receiving service here, explore your options.<//Text>< pics>

I went in there totally distraught, I had just bout a used Jeep from a used dealer in Sacramento the Thursday before and it now wasn’t starting. It was my family’s on vehicle and I had spent most of our savings on it. I went in and was immediately told that they probably couldn’t even look at it until the following week and they had no loaner cars. I broke down immediately, what was I gonna do? Kyle in service was great! He didn’t promise me anything but said he would do his best to squeeze it in the next day but at the latest it would be Tuesday. I left disappointed and discouraged. The next day Kyle text me telling me that my car was ready for pickup, I couldn’t believe it! My car has been running great ever since! Thanks Kyle! So much!<//Text>

<text>I went for a scheduled appointment with my 2014 Chrysler Town & Country Minivan. The gentleman that helped me was ridiculously nice and polite. I can tell it's a very positive atmosphere with great employee morale. They offered me shuttle service and did an exceptional job for a very competitive price.  They reported that my vehicle was in great condition and didn't even recommend any repairs/maintenance which would result in more expenses, something that other oil change locations tend to do too much for my comfort. I was very pleased and look forward to returning for my vehicle service needs.

Update -- I went once more after the aforementioned visit and spent around $1,500 for a full service tuneup. I was then recently due for an oil change and was unable to schedule an appointment for a 3rd visit. I spoke to a lady online and said that someone would reach out to me. I gave her my name and information and she said she had no record of it. I don't need red carpet treatment, but $1,500 is a lot of money for me -- to somehow  not have my email that I registered previously and furthermore not contact me for an appointment after I was told that someone would reach out to me made me feel bad. After failing to receive a call back or an email, I decided to go to Valvoline. I received a lot of communication after each visit at Lithia texting me to submit an online review, hence the review I left previously -- I wish that same communication was put forth towards returning customers that have spent valuable money with them. I'm hoping they improve because I trust Lithia's staff more than Valvoline -- the time I have to commit to coordinate an oil change unfortunately may prevent me from returning.</text><user>110503992429350426150< /user>< Pics>

This place is so shady they even stuff their reviews. No way its a 4 star dealership.

Just stay away from this place. Had a ton of issues with a Jeep I purchased they said they needed to keep it a well, when it showed up at my door a week later it had 500 more miles than what I purchased it at and an excuse that they had a faulty seat belt. I just called them back to get my refund on a warranty and they don't even bother calling back. Went to another dealership and had the paperwork completed for my warranty refund in 2 minutes.< /review>

<review>This is the first time for me buying from Lithia Dodge in SR.  What a great experience.  Never once was there any pressure.  Rick Epting was super, and going forward I can say he is a friend.  And, the financing portion of the process was the fastest I'd ever experienced. Steve Archer was equally good in all his information, clear and concise.  Of course, I love my RAM 1500 pickup that they gave me an incredible deal on.
Highly recommend these guys for buying a car or truck.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Won't go back to this place, 5 times with the same issue with my radio that they couldn't duplicate.  When I finally got one of the service reps to spend 2 minutes with me and showed them the problem, they literally stopped returning my calls.  I have been to this dealer for service many times and was never blown away with customer service and their timetables and communication were always poor at best.

Went to a new dealer - they found the problem in 2 hours and fixed it.< /Review>

Yesterday I decided to do some research on my next pick up. My pickup I have at the moment has been showing signs of fatigue and ready to retire. I already have one car payment and really can't afford another one or I would have got the truck that was offered to me yesterday. At Lithia Chrysler Dodge in Santa Rosa Jared Bertolli was absolutely wonderful. I informed him that I was just window-shopping and really was not looking to leave with a truck today. This sweet man took me around, even though he knew I wasn't going to be leaving with a vehicle that day, and was never pushy, which was a nice change for a dealership. However, when I told him that I had no money down to put on a vehicle anyway he offered to run the numbers for no money down. Without giving too much away about my personal offer, let's just say that Jared really went to bat for me. He did so well for me that I felt guilty leaving without the truck. If I could have taken on another payment, I would have definitely been leaving with that truck. Jared was amazing! His floor manager was just as wonderful. I feel terrible that I can't remember the floor managers name right now. If you're serious about looking into a new/used vehicle, Jared at Lithia Chrysler Dodge is the guy to talk to :-)<//text>

<username>Christopher Brelsford< /username><Time>1551136307902</Time><rate>2<//rate><Text>Went here several times to fix an issue with a Patriot my wife owns. Every time I went it it was a minimum of 15 minutes of standing there in the lobby like I am picking my kids up from school. No one spoke to me, nor asked If I had been helped. They even seem to actively avoid eye contact, and when spoken to simply indicate they will be with you shortly. Even with an appointment it was a 15 minute wait before being helped at all. At that point they have to be trying to mess with you right?

On top of that, the problem I brought the vehicle in for never got fixed, despite bringing it in twice, with assurances it would be fixed the second time. They offered a free third attempt at fixing it, and a lot of shady reasons on why it hadn't been fixed yet and the problem was something else but, honestly, why would we take you up on it after 2 failed attempts already?</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>Brought my car in for an oil change and brake inspection. At my scheduled appointment time.
After several hours I was called and they said my car was ready. I picked it up and said thank you and left. About two blocks away I noticed that 9 miles had been put on my car.
I went right back and asked for an explanation.
The very young boy at the service counter said what do you want me to do about it. I asked him to find someone that could clear this up.
He with a huge smirk on his face said Sir this is not my problem and walked away.
When I returned home I looked under the hood and found that the air filter cover was hanging over the side and the engine was covered in some sort of silver overspray.
I made several attempts of contacting the service manager Kyle Hoffman to no avail.
I even had an employee tell me he was there and tried to get him on the phone with me but he let his phone go to voicemail. Again!
I have pictures to prove everything I have stated and including the service Departments statement showing the 9 miles put on my car.
If you own a Hi Proformance vehicle such as my challenge SRT find someplace else for your service needs.<//text>< Pics>

Took a Jeep into the dealership to have an oil consumption issue looked at. They did an oil change, and reported metal shavings in the oil. Was suggested that we do a leakdown test to find out where the failure is, but first to put some miles on it to determine how much oil it was burning. Brought it back to the dealership, who sat on it for a week and did literally nothing, didn't call or contact us at all unless prompted, and when I finally went in there personally to find out what the hell was going on, was told sand in the engine caused the motor failure and it would cost $10,000 to fix because they wouldn't warranty it due to the sand. I asked for proof of where the sand was, they could not provide any, and admitted they didn't actually remove anything to look, just that there was sand on the outside of the motor. I refused to authorize $450 in teardown to look for sand in the motor, knowing it wasn't true, and immediately took it to my shop, pulled the intake tract apart, and found a perfectly clean intake system. I will never be doing business with them again, and will strongly suggest everyone stay far away. Oh, and I also asked for them to fix an open safety recall issue while it was in their possession, and they did not do this either.</text>

Not even a joke. when buying I assume may come out ok maybe, but I am here to tell you, if you have a problem, your left in darkness. made to pay premium prices and get the worst service I have ever experienced. Was going to purchase a new dodge, but Ford may just win after this horrific experience. A simple repair has turned into my vehicle being put into a deep state of disrepair and they cant find any parts. as another response mentioned, don't walk away, RUNNN!!!!!
Now if I can just get ahold of someone just to pay for and remove my truck from this hellish place so I can repair it.</review></record></dataset><record>

From start to finish the people at Lithia CDJRF took care of me. I price checked them against another dealer who laughed at me when I showed him my quote. He said if I thought that I could actually buy the truck at that price i should go do so because he couldn't even get close. So that's exactly what I did! Thanks Lithia!<//Text>

I arrived prior to my scheduled service time and was waited on promptly.  I received numerous calls informing me of the progress of the repair.  I highly commend the repair technician who took the initiative to not replace a part previously ordered,  but to further trace the problem. His action identified the lift motor to be defective.  Replacing the motor fixed the problem with my lift gate.  The service provided by all those involved was,  by far,  superior to what is demonstrated by most businesses today.<//Text>

Purchased a new top of the line diesel truck with all the bells and whistles (purchasing experience was great and the truck is nice). Added lifetime oil changes, cause not ever having to pay for another oil change sounded awesome! Now that its time for an oil change the wait time is literally over 3 weeks! And no this is not uncommon as I have been trying to fit it into my schedule for the last few months and since this frustration I have brought it up to others that have had the same problem. Guess I’ve been had again, buying into a service that’s more inconvenient to use then its worth…..< /Text>

Service department is very disorganized. Right hand does not communicate with left hand. No one to greet you outside once you pull up. Waited inside for, yes, 10 minutes before was even acknowledged and there was only two other customers in there. Had oil change, balance rotation and recall work to be done. 4th recall on this truck and haven't even had for two yrs. Yes bought brand new. Was told will take 4 hrs for one recall. This is the closest service place to me. 30 miles away. Oil change and rotaion  hour and half one good day, recall 4 hrs, other work 1 hr. Equals 6.5 hours. They said hopefully won't take that long, hopefully. I tried to setup a shuttle but they won't go the 30miles. Ok, being that all this is mainly recall work,  I asked for a rental. Was told to call FCA. I did. Gentleman at FCA said to talk to Nate (manager) and that he should be calling you. Never had a call to me. So I asked to speak to Nate when I went in. I was told NO, that Nate is to busy and doesn't have time. I was told this by Zach. I explained the situation and Zach told me that it isn't their real about the recall that they only fix them. I was told to pay for a rental car since I also had a job to do and also get back home to care for my 92 yr old grandfather. I told Zach that it's a recall and I have to fork out money for a recall, yes was his answer and he also said sorry we cant help you. I was also told to turn on my rental car payment and that maybe they might reimburse me. Ya, right. I paid for a rental car. They would not help me in any way shape or form and Zach said that this came down from management, no more rental cars. I was done and back by 3:00. At 3:14 I was called by zach that my vehicle was ready. I already told the other guy I was here. If Zach would have turned around he would have seen me sitting there. Again no communication. The phone call was in stereo I was so close. I was charged $60 for balance and rotation in which I paid for a service when I bought the truck that I wouldn't have to pay. So much for that. They also did not perform the proper maintenance that was suppose to be done on the truck. There is a sticker on the fender and it states in the owners manual that the front drive line needs to be greased every oil change. This was not on the invoice for work performed. I asked Zach about this, he said , didnt know that had to be done. Zach said that he went back to the guy that did the work and he said no he didnt do it. Zach brought up my truck and said keys are in it, there you go. I asked him if it was common practice to not perform work gratis suppose to be completed. He said no. I said that's what you are doing, never offered to take the truck back to complete the work. This is the second time they have done this. I told him I want it done, zach replied we don't have  time right now to do it. He said we will do it. I told him yes, after I brought it up. He said it won't be done now. I asked, so you will come to where I live to pick up my truck to complete the work. Zach replied no, bring it back some other time. I had 2 customers come to me after I dropped off my truchk and saying was in the right and they are in the wrong. I had another business say to me that dealership isn't good at all. Get business did not know my story, they basically told me to run. Nice Lithia. Lithia Dodge has demonstrated that they don't want to talk with their customers, help them and are very disorganized. But they sure will charge you for things they aren't suppose to, not perform the work that is suppose to be completed. There is a very strong "I DONT CARE" attitude. It was displayed and it showed. The trash laying around there should have been clue number on.
5/29
Follow up, as stated by the "owner" to call the number and try to reach a resolution. All that number does is go to a directory that you choose from service, finance,  parts or office dept. Have no idea who I am suppose to talk to or a name. I see this as they are trying to pass it off as them being the good in reviews, nope! Dead end!<//text>

Horrible dealership!!! Horrible customer service!!
They had my truck for over 3 months and two months prior to that. They "fixed" it the first time. Then it had problems again. I scheduled an appointment and brought it back. It took two weeks from that appointment for them to diagnose the problem. They of coarse claimed had nothing to do with what happened before. However it ended up being the housing. Just proving it was not fixed properly the first time. I was told every exscuse and lie they could think of from waiting 6 weeks for parts, getting those parts needing more parts, there's two trucks in front of me even though they had my truck for two months, THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PUT PARTS IN!, they "lost" my keys which had my tool box keys on them (which was locked when I dropped it off). I contacted corporate and a lawyer. They apparently did not like that because when I got my truck back every paper in my glove box was thrown all over my truck, a sog emergency kit and my yeti water bottle was stolen out of my truck. Items from inside my truck were in the truck bed. It was also weird that my tool box was unlocked and gone through. Those keys were on the keys they had possession of? I confronted the service manager. He just shrugged and instantly said they are not responsible and have had no break ins. He could of apologized and said im sorry this happened while your vehicle was in our procession but instead was instantly defensive and rude. I would go to any other dealership. Completely unprofessional. I have a Toyota and a Ford both have extremely better customer service.< /Review>

<Review>Bought a Ram 1500 in 2016.  Salesman/price was fine.  Been taking in for service since purchase .  Have a recurring issue with drivers window that has been verified on 3 separate occassions by service dept.  Part has been on order since Nov 2017.  Had service done in May 2018.  No part and service dept suggested I replace part, again.  Have left 2 messages in 2 weeks for Kyle the service manager, still waiting for call back.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808437d8578dd81f:0xf1a3aceda1038ada< /gmap_id>< date>

The service department was professional and the service was quick. Only wish they washed the vehicle after the service, left a lot of oily hand prints on the chrome wheels and hood of truck. I have never gone to a dealer for service that did not wash your vehicle.  Other than that, it was good.< /review>

<review>Very disappointed with the service. I took my car in on April 24th to get it checked out. Informed the advisor of the code I got on the scanner. A week went by with no one contacting me on what was happening with my car. I left voicemails and nothing. I went to the Service department and spoke to an advisor. I informed them that I didn’t not want to go continue with the car fixing since it was too costly. I paid $330 for diagnostic and compression test, however if I continued it was going to be an additional 2k. I received a call to pick up my car. I showed up and my car was not ready. There was a lack of communication among the advisor and tech. I had to wait 6 extra days to get it back.

When I finally picked up the car, it was worse than when I had brought it in. My car was drivable when I brought it in and with the code PO306. However, when I got it it was making a weird noise, and basically shutting off on me. I expressed to an advisor that many codes popped up and there was more dashboard lights (ETC & ESP) that came on. He stated that the lights turned on because of the problem with the car. I wasted time and gas (since I live in Sonoma) due to the lack of communication  and my car is worse than when I brought it in, basically non-drivable. Worst experience ever!

Update:

I called the number they gave me and the same thing happened again. They lack communication! I called to talk about the problem I experienced. Why bother responding to the reviews if you guys are not helpful! Are you guys just trying to make it seem like you care? I had a family mechanic take a look at it and he said they had not put on the egr valve gasket correct. Looked like it was just shoved in, therefore, the car was shutting off and lighting the etc light. I asked to speak to a manager, however, they said he was not available. I left a voicemail with my information. I have NOT heard back from them. I’m very disappointed with their service. Hopefully this does not keep happening to customers! I tried trusting dealerships even when I’ve heard negative things about them.</review>< Pics>

I tried calling to speak with someone in the service department and its like looking for a needle in a haystack.Went to check in for my initial oil change and stood in front of a guy looking at his computer screen and didn’t even acknowledge I was  there, a simple “we will be right with you” would of been nice, bad costumer service. Now I have to wait 2 days for an appointment to get my car looked at and it’s leaking all over my car port. Management needs to look into this please.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Undergoing a renovation and it's terribly loud to the point that you can't hear yourself think.  Dirt and dust everywhere.  Extremely limited seating  the service department.  They have temporary bathrooms outside that are smelly and disgusting. It  took me 3 tries before finding a stall that wasn't fully stuffed with toiler paper,  maybe people just didn't know how to flush them,  but they definitely needed some attention.  Called 4 times before getting through to the service department,
got hung up on twice.   Finally left a message for someone to call back.  Talking our vehicle elsewhere next time.   Definitely not a place that I would go back to.< /Review>

<text>I've had my jeep for about a month now was pressured to do a survey by the dealership and give all 10s which I'm glad I didn't. The financial manager Chris rushed me to sign sign sign the questions I asked he lied ended up costing me an additional $4,000 on extras that he said were mandatory as I reviewed my loan with my lawyer all the extra was optional but when I asked Chris if i had to have them he said "yes" I was also put in a simple interest loan after I specifically told him I didn't want this kind of loan. Just be aware & read all forms thoroughly don't get fast talked like I did. I'm very dissatisfied in the process of purchasing my vehicle</text>< user_id>

Came in here to buy a part for my truck, waited by the parts counter for 15 minutes with my son before I finally got upset and started yelling towards the garage area and someone said we will be right there (5 minutes later). There were 4-5 guys from the service department just sitting there and not one of them offered to go find someone to help me. Payed for the part which they had to order and left. The part I ordered was $98.70. When reviewing my bank statement a few days later I noticed they ALSO charged me $150.30. When I called them they put me on hold a few times then finally came back and said they were going to be mailing me a check. When I asked what happened they said their system had a glitch. A glitch might be a double charge not a completely different amount. This is extremely bad business and I wonder how many other people are being charged for stuff and they don't pay attention.</review>

Visited several dealers to get information on a new Ram 1500.  Lithia was the only one that was knowledgeable, friendly, and fair.  Ended up buying from Lithia for its no-pressure, and fair pricing.  Never been a fan of auto salesman, but a Rick was great.</text>

Avoid this place at all cost I just went to try to trade my 2017 rebel with 14000 miles for a new 2019 rebel we did all the paperwork and when it was time for the numbers they offered $28000 for the truck I told the sales representative that I checked the kbb trade value and that it was $38000-$42000 so I wanted at least $37000 for the truck so he said that they couldn’t do that price so I said ok so we don’t have a deal he went back inside and grabbed one of the “managers “ and I explained the situation and that I wanted at least $37000 for the truck and he’s response was “ok that sounds fair enough call kbb and ask them to buy your truck” I was like really I just grabs my keys and walked away. I forgot your name but you know who you are I don’t think kbb would buy the truck but give me you Mom’s phone number maybe she’ll buy it<//Text>

Excellent service and customer care at Lithia of Santa Rosa. I drive all the way up from Novato, to go to Lithia, because the folks at Autoworld Petaluma are douchebags 🤷‍♂️.

Always had an awesome experience with Lithia CDJRF of SR! Recommend them all the time rather than going to Autoworld.</review>

Service department is horrible gives me a different excuse everytime. Would like to put a 0 or a negative. Brought my Dodge Journey here 4 separate times to have them fix touch screen unit because my navigation or DVD player haven't been working a yr after I bought the car. Took a day off work the first time and sent me home because they said I probably just need to upload new info to navigation. 2nd time my wife went and said if we have them reboot it it would cost $600. 3rd time (By this time me and my family moved to Sacramento but still go out there to get our service done because we have family in the area) Still had doubts that they weren't doing there job right and ask Matt, he said "I was covered under warranty  I dont know why they didn't tell you this before sorry, (which IDK why they didn't do this the first time) they diagnosed that day and said they would order the part take 7 to 10days to arrive and call us when it would arrive. They never called us so we called after 2 weeks after told us " it has been sitting here." Finally we rescheduled 2 weeks prior 4/24/19 and told them if they could reassure us they could get it done in one day during the week because I would be out there all day. Told us it wouldn't be a problem because they have more mechanics on hand during a week day then on a weekend. 4th time I arrive at 8am that day only to find out that the touch screen unit was shipped back, to make it worst shane said "still needed to do a 2day diagnostic again". I was furious!!! Shane didn't do much to resolve my issue, blamed everything on Matt who no longer works there. Shane said that "the facts are that we have to do a 2day diagnostic" that's it. Horrible customer service worst I have ever experienced. Thanks for doing absolutely nothing Lithia in the last 2yrs to resolve this issue.</text>

I made an appointment for some recall work that needed to be done.  My driver brought the truck in ram 3500, could not find the key drop so left the keys hidden in the truck.  I called and left a voicemail with the service department telling them this.  Called in around noon to see what was going on, they didn't know anything about the appointment or the truck.  They found the truck and keys but didn't have the parts.  After 4 or 5 calls and voicemails to finally get someone back on the phone I told them to call me when the parts were in.  When my driver picked up the truck they told him to come in on Monday but I had never received any confirmation on parts or appointment.

Overall they are very disorganized and bad at communication.< /Text>

<text>Brought in two cars, one for an oil change and one to fix a headlight. Forst, they kept my car for over a week during the hokidays because they were too busy to fix the light. No offer of a courtesy car or rental. THEN I was charged over $500 to replace a headlight, 2 hours of which was "diagnostic work" to figure out it was a fuse and not the headlight. Tried to pull the same "we need to keep your car" line with my send vehicle until I put my foot downm in the end they told me I could pick it up same day but I got charged $100 for the oil change (which was covered under my service plan purchased with the vehicle) because they had to turn off a light on my dashboard.

I was not able to be there when the papers were signed , as I was sick in bed. But Tony walked me through every detail on FaceTime and explained all the features.  I was given my own personal virtual tour. It’s was awesome !  I was very impressed with that service , because he made me feel as if I was a part of the excitement of getting a new car after,  I was very bummed out that I wasn’t able to be there in person. I hung up very excited and thought that was such a over the top incredible service I was given.  He also sent me videos to watch of more features. And he’s followed up with a phone call to see if I was happy with my new Renegade and wanted me to know he was there if I ever have any questions.
Thanks Lithia Santa Rosa California for making this a extremely positive and helpful experience with outstanding service ! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Service was premo

I do however have one complaint I paid for the truck in one lump payment and did not get a full tank of gas, in fact I received the truck on empty I had to go straight to the gas  station.

I would say 5 star but dang send me a 100 dollar gas card and I will continue to do Buisness with you in the future.

Your employee Jarret did a awesome job better give that man a raise god bless him!

Sincerely,

James keenan<//review>

Such a sad stressful experience. I traded in my  Good car For a car with less miles In hopes that it would beThe only car I needed for the next 10 years. That wasn't the case. I don't know a lot about cars but I know when I hear a funny noise it was the transmission. Prior to bringing it back to Lithia I took it to a reputable auto shop and a reputable transmission shop costing another $300. I made a service appointmentFor them to fix quite a few different things because it was under warranty. Unfortunately  it took them an entire week to fix a light bulb with horrible communication in between and in conclusion their team was not competent enough to  Fix the transmission problem. they told me I would have to Go to ford to see what the problem was and then bring it back so they could fix it, I wasn't understanding why so I asked to speak to a manager, I was approached and started telling him what was wrong when he responded " it's your car of course you have to fix it what did you expect and how do we know you didn't ruin the transmittion!" I started crying and ran out! They also told me  I went straight over to forward for some reason I thought they would know I was coming, and they did not on top of that they were going to charge me $160 an hour! I tried to make an appointment but they told me the transmission department of service was booked months out luckily Petaluma had an appointment 2 weeks later.  In the meantime I tried to reach out to corporate to see if there is anything they can do they told me to talk to the dealership. By this point I was so over talking to the dealership but I  held off until after the appointment they told me that the clutch would have to be replaced amongst a bunch of other things.

THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND SOLD ME A LEMON!!

After my appointment I went back to Lithia To see if I could trade the car in for a different one that was safe and runs. With the $3000 deduction of my vehicle I paid $7000 for the broken car.  There was only a few cars with in my $12000 budget so I went for different car. Severely stressed and overwhelmedI just wanted out of this car. I sign for the new car That they didn't even clean 1st and it took over a month for the previous loan to fall off  Damaging my credit for the worst. So now this is my second Vehical from them.
I have a friend suffering from stage 4 cancer he is in a hospital in San  Francisco  on my 1st trip I parked and thought I smelled something funny in the new car,  But I didn't go as far to think something of it. The 2nd trip the car barely made it up the Hill with my pedal all the way to the floor so scary it was unbelievable. So now I'm stuck so far  in debt for a car that also has problems. I realized I am now paying $18000 for a vehicle instead of my $7000  I am out the 3000 for my trade and the 2nd down payment and auto repair charges For a total of $23000.  I should have sued them while I had the chance.
Wow! Please do yourself a favor  If you want a reliable car, do not go to this dealership they sell you bad cars with no solutions that only hurt you, your family and your wallet! It's so sad that there is businesses like this in our county,  But so fortunate For media to warn the good hard working people in it.< /text>

<Review>I had the worst experience with Lithia of Santa Rosa. Long story short, after having my brand new 2018 Jeep jk in for a dealer install equipment, I got it back with major damage to the interior and exterior.
Kyle Hoffman and Nathen have both teamed up against me and will not help me in anyway. All the damage they caused and I’m forced to pay out of pocket to fix.
To add to this Kyle has also told me to never come back to his dealership. One way to get rid of a problem. I have also reported them to the BBB</Review><time>1547273317186< /time>< resp>

I bought a car (2014 RAM) from this dealership on in December 2016. I trusted them to inspect the car and make sure there are no problems. AFTER 2 WEEKS I duscovered the car seat is broken , 2 MORE WEEKS the brake pedal started squeaking. I had to miss work for 2 days because I had to go there to fix it. 2 MONTHS Later the battery died and I had to buy (for a 2014 RAM) a NEW BATTERY ! ! ! 2 WEEKS LATER the engine lite is on, another problem with the fuel ($700 to repair). They refused to fix the problems with the car. They refused to compensate me. Their service is horrible. Do not buy there - a complete ripoff. You cannot trust their cars, they promise you service but they deliver nothing but bad experience and aggravation and extra expenses.

<name>Filip Zaborek<//name><text>Where should I start. First, I bought a car and first they tried to rip me off on my loan. Saying my APR was gonna be 14.2%, but if I purchase a extend warranty it would drop to 9.9%. I didn't purchase the warranty after a hard pitch, then the fiance guy was pissed off slamming papers around. I ended up with the 9.9% without purchasing the warranty. They tried to SCAM me and looks like from the reviews others also.
Second, I have had the car for 10 days and the check engine light just came on. Great! Going to get it serviced this week and see whats going on. The car is also telling me to check gas inlet every time I start the car. This is also something that wasn't happening when I made my purchase.
I'm hoping this doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. I would not recommend this dealer, form the sound of it they shouldn't be able to do business.< /text>< pictures>

Twice now I’ve had the oil changed at Lithia on my Fiat and twice they have reinstalled the bottom engine cover incorrectly. This time they left out the bolts in front again and one good bike and it drops down to be destroyed on the pavement as you drive. I will never go back if they can’t even do an oil change without messing up my car.<//Review>

<time>1532570528238< /time><rate>1<//rate><review>I came in 7/25, at 6 pm to look at the versa, with the salesmen, which was extremely hard to find.....I had simply asked him the price of two cars, one other as well as the black used versa for sale, in which all cars are completely filthy. But the price is in the 6k range and I am in need of a car in which I tell this man. He goes to get the keys to show me what it looks like, knowing I would like to buy it. While I am waiting I go to my car have a smoke and meet him at the versa.
Now I obviously will get nowhere near the car that I am planning to buy with my cigarette. So as he opens the door I place it on the concrete behind the back tire.
At this point the salesman stops me to inform me that I am not able to have this anywhere, and how could I possibly do such a thing on their property, as well as informing that I should stay completely away from this car. In turn I remind him that I am still interested to slow his role a bit. But he carried on and I made the choice to leave the dealership, and take my purchase decision elsewhere.
It is a shame.

We take all three to the dealer for service. I have a tendency to stick with the same folks I like. For the last 10 plus years I have gone not only to the same dealership for the service, but the same service advisor as well. Luis Carrillo has been an excellent, and after 10 long years. He is still providing excellent service. Thanks to all of Santa Rosa Dodge Chrysler and Jeep, you guys are awesome.</review>< pictures>

3rd lifetime synthetic oil change, tire rotate and code check. Deric in service does a great job. Fast and accurate on the "check-in", details like "please do a code update check" and other details have been accurately covered each of these three times.< /text>

My experience with Tony Vangeli was very positive.  He made the process fun, informative, and easy.  He was a no-pressure salesman, which I really appreciated.  I went to test drive the 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, and within a couple hours, was driving it home.  The financing part of the deal was also very easy.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

We called this dealership and they told me to drive the hour to the showroom with my two young kids and they would do a good deal on exchanging the car as I could no longer charge and drive it to my work place in the place we have been relocated to. It was a total waste of time they wanted me to pay off the car in full and start a brand new lease.. All they care about is sales and they were SO rude to us. Makes me sick!</review>< name>

The salesman was very easy going and forthcoming. Such a change from the experience at Carmax.  Even though we did not end up buying from him we did not feel guilted and pressured like we did at Carmax.  He was good with the kids and answered any questions we had.  Very friendly.

I took my Jeep here because the check engine light was on along with with other issues. Turns out they dont know how to work on jeeps and told me my jeep was fine. After frustration and being robbed $181 for "services" i took my jeep to Ultimate Auto Care in santa rosa and im extremely happy i did because my jeep was finally fixed! Do not I Repeat do not go here unless you want to be robbed of your money. The only reason i would give a star to this place is because Zach at the service counter is nice.<//text>

Ask for Tony Vangeli, he was by far the most fun and reliable dealer around. He gave us honest facts no BS. All about your needs, he will give you the best price, very personal gets to the point and makes sure you're satisfied.< /review>

Had refined my car search and found this dealership had what I wanted or so I thought based on the ads and the overall customer service reviews!
Worst shopping experience EVER, at least over the phone!
Posted a bait car as an automatic. I followed up with a call to ask questions & was blown off by the salesperson answering the phone, was told it was manual rather than the automatic as advertised! I called again then told it was at another dealership, really?
Then started receiving same car suggestions from all of their dealerships. I foolishly gave them my name & phone #, never again!
Would not care to go to the dealership let alone contemplate purchasing ANY car from them!</Text>

Scheduled recall work on my car resulted in a full day of work missed. Followed immediately by several warning lights related to hillstart, crusie control, and check engine. I returned and after 1 and a half hours was told that it is an issue with a tail light switch that had just been replaced during the recall work. Requested my car be returned as is for second opinion by my regular mechanic. The return of my car took 30 minutes. I do not find the service or the business to be trustworthy and do not recommend it.<//review>

Someone scheduled an appointment with me this morning (for this afternoon) to test drive a car. I had to take off work to get to the dealership and when I got there, they told me they sold that car last night. This is an incredibly inconsiderate and unorganized form of business and I will never consider purchasing a vehicle from this vendor again.<//review>

<Review>I have to say the service shop does excellant work. After buying two new vehicles at Lithia in Santa Rosa I have to say the buying experience was the best I have had after 50 years of buying new vehicles. Why don't I give them 5 stars? Making an appointment for service is a nightmare. For the last two service dates they had me scheduled for the wrong day.  Talking with a human to make a service appt. is nearly impossible. I don't know why they can't have a service coordinator to take calls. This is not a new issue, this has been going on for years according to reviews.
I would think hard the next time about buying the life time oil changes. It has nothing to do with the quality of work they preform. I believe that is as good and maybe better than most shops. Its all about the poor system they have for handling service appts.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>The last time I purchased a domestic car was in 1976.  My and my wife's family choice of cars in the last 25 years has been limited to either Honda or Toyota.  Before purchasing the Dodge,  my wife still expressed concern on buying domestic and the experiences we had with domestic cars.  I decided to relook at American cars and this dealership was a game changer.  The change was due to pricing, quality built cars, comprehensive warranty and professional dealership.  Here is my experience.

I wanted to purchase a Dodge Challenger and Lithia had one of the most aggressive pricing.  I spoke with Jarret Garrigan and he sent me a picture of the car on the lot to my I-phone.  I drove over 70 miles to see the car with no switch and bait tactics.  I was pleasantly surprise how professional the dealership was managed.  There were no high pressure tactics.  They showed a high level of integrity and professionalism.  This was not the case at my local dodge dealership.  I also found Steve Archer, Finance Manager very professional and also exhibiting same level of integrity.  No high pressure tactics on the extended warranty or other options.

The following week I needed to have a scratch repaired on the hood of the car.  I noticed it before taking the car but the Service Department was closed on Sunday.  When I arrived, Jarret spoke with the service department and it was taken care in a timely and professional way.  No arguments or issues.  Bill Percy, sales advisor was professional and straightforward and needs special mention as well.  This is how a dealership should be managed and a model for all dealerships not just Dodge.

Time will tell on reliability but Dodge’s lifetime warranty goes a long way in elevating this concern.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I had an appointment today 7-7-2017 at 1:50 p.m. to have the keys reprogrammed on my Dodge Charger arrived there on time and stood inside of this tiny office with another couple and 2 other gentlemen who worked there

After standing awkwardly watching one person help the couple and them leaving I said "if you guys are busy I can come back"
"Did you have an appointment today? Then you need to wait"

In the duration of my wait 6 or 7 employees walked past me with out asking if I needed help or if i had been helped. If anything the looks I got were more along the lines of are you lost

After being ignored I walked outside and called the petaluma dodge service department and was actually quoted a cheaper price for both keys instead of only one and the person I spoke to didn't make it seem like I was an inconvenience by asking him to take my money

If you're a minority and plan on getting work here DON'T goto petaluma or have one of your "buddies" go in for you that way you'll have an increased chance of actually getting helped

If someone told me I would have to go back to this dealership or walk for the rest of my life
I'd rather walk

I will never bring any of my cars or recommend anyone I know get any sort of work or buy cars from this location<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

The Service Department generally doesn't even bother to answer the phone. Typically it's voice mail only and you may or may not even get a response, let alone a timely one. Wasn't too happy with the work either.<//Review>

Dealership is a complete RIPOFF. We drove almost 2 hours to purchase a Truck.
I was told over the phone this was a 9 out of 10. When I got to the dealer, the vehicle had body damage and was not the exact model I was told it was. But after a while we deceived to purchase the truck for my son and I would deal with the issues myself at the right price. I told the salesman to give me the dealers best price. The salesman wanted to know how much I was going to put down, how much could I afford in payments, how was my credit etc... I said please just tell me the out the door price you will take. The truck was used and listed for $36,990.00 The salesman returned 5 mins later with the out the door price of $41,999.00. No deal at all just complete AH. So we left with my $20,000 cash in my pocket and we are still looking. Dont buy here.
This was a 2 year old truck with 30,000 miles, bald tires and some body damage.< /review>

The worst experience I've ever had with the service center,  Drop my jeep off 26 days ago for the engine to be replaced still hasn't been done they received a replacement engine and  after they receive it they said they noticed other damages so they had to order more parts.  This place is a joke would not recommend it to anyone< /Text>

i came in today to look at ram 1500's and the sales guys there were great. Kent helped me a few days ago when i came in the first time and he was really nice guy. i came in today to look again and test drive one i found the first time i came in and Chris helped me today and he was really good, honest and quick. definitely the fastest i have ever bought a car. the finance guy that helped, Tsoai (soey) Gordley, was awesome and really quick and explained everything good. definitely a good experience.</Review>

<Text>I have been having regular issues with the transmission on a 2014 Jeep Cherokee. It has been pretty frustrating but the truly bright spot in all this is the service advisor Luis Carillo. He is helpful and honest and goes the extra mile. I needed a replacement ESM (Electronic Shift Module) and there was apparently only 1 in the whole country. He snagged it and a week later it was replaced. That seems to have cured most of my transmission problems but only time will tell.  On the last visit he had my car washed and did a number of other things to try to compensate for the many trips I have to make to get this fixed.

Thanks, Luis. You have redefined the term "service".< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Just some scammers,
All good reviews probably made by the owner himself
Would have done negative stars if I could.
Wasted my time.
Lithia dodge etc and all affiliates dont deserve any trust from people.<//review>

My 2015 Grand Cherokee is the second Dodge product I've bought from Lithia since early last year.  I bought a 2015 Dodge Ram 1500 last year and it's been the best new vehicle I've bought in many years.  The sale staff and sales strategy at Lithia is why I returned.  No foolish dickering on price while you sit and the salesman and sales manager have coffee in a back office trying to sweat you into paying too much. Bottom line prices are posted right on the windows and you buy or don't buy based on that.  If you ask, they will show you the invoice and if you push a bit you can get a better dealer discount like I did on my Cherokee.

As far as the sales staff, I want to again thank Graham Shillaker.  He is the most knowledgeable sales person I have ever encountered,  If you want to know how something works and want to be shown how all the new technology works he's your man.  I haven't found a question that he doesn't have an immediate answer for.  That is so refreshing these days since other salesmen, at other dealerships generally are so inept they give you the "deer in the headlights" look if you ask and technical or even mechanical questions at all.

I would also like to thank Adam Jones for taking over for Graham to get our paperwork started when Graham had to finish up with other customers he was helping when we returned to make our purchase.

Both of these guys stayed well past quitting time to get our paperwork done and out purchase made.

On the day we purchased the Cherokee, we looked at Acura, Nissan, Ford, Honda and Chevy and none of their products could come close to the quality, workmanship, comfort, performance and features included in the Jeep Grand Cherokee.

One other major factor in our purchase of another Dodge product is the complete satisfaction we have experienced with the Dodge Ram 1500 we bought early last year.  I currently have 13,000 miles on it and it has been the best new truck, so far, I have ever purchased.  Like the Cherokee, it far surpasses the competitors by a long shot in overall quality and workmanship.

If you're in the market for a new vehicle, give Dodge a try.  Then go to Lithia to make your purchase.  You'll be glad you did.< /Review>

<Text>Worst experience ever! Your service dept. needs a complete over haul. I have been to your facility at least 8 times trying to get my check engine light fixed on my new 2014 ram truck. Dash board lights have been shorting out as well. You had my truck for 2 days, with no feed back whatsoever . Not even a phone call, to let me know you were keeping my truck. Guess what? Engine light is still malfunctioning along with dash lights. Then you have the audacity to charge me for a fricken tire rotation? You should have at least comped me fricken 14 bucks for all the gas and time I have spent to, from and at your facility. Shame on you Lithia. My pmts are never late, I take amazing care of my truck, never late for my apps. I even manage my own rides. You have treated me so disrespectfully. I will NEVER, refer anyone to your lot. So sad to feel so taken advantaged of. You are horrid. A very dissatisfied customer.< /Text>< pictures>

We never received a call about getting our car cleaned as when we bought the car the service dept was closed. We called several times and they never returned our calls. We were also supposed to get new locks that we bought with a protection plan. They never called again and we called multiple times and even went in and were turned away and told to make an appointment. We finally got fed up with this and went in July to get these taken off our loan as well as the lifetime oil and warranty as we never wanted to deal with lithia again. They had no problem removing it. They said it would take 4-8 weeks for our lender to get the refund. We called in August and they said it was taken care of and to talk to our lender. The lender said they never received anything. So we called back and the finance guys were never able to talk. We have called once every other week since August. It’s now December and we FINALLY have been able to get ahold of someone. The finance guy I spoke to was very rude and defensive saying they sent payment in August. He said if they don’t have payment to call mopar. He said there is nothing more they can do. I called my lender back and they confirmed they have gotten no payments or refunds from lithia or mopar. I called back and he was extremely rude and laughed at me and hung up on me in mid sentence. I called again to speak with a manager and left a manager a message. He then called back arguing with me calling me a liar and saying he didn’t know I was talking and that we were done with the conversation. I hung up and called again asking for Steve fox and the guy who answered the phone laughed at me for asking for Steve fox and transferred me. I am now waiting to hear back from him and don’t think this will ever be resolved. I really just want to be done with lithia. NEVER AGAIN will I ever buy anything from lithia. I suggest you stay far away from them!!!< /review><gmap_id>0x808437d8578dd81f:0xf1a3aceda1038ada< /gmap_id>< pics>

It was installed by another car dealer and did not end up working. I had people pointing blame at others, yet I was left with spending a lot of money and no working harness.
I will say the documentation from Mopar is lacking and little information could be found on the Internet.
I was at a loss and looking at throwing more money at this and vented here on Google.
Steve Fox, General Manager at Lithia reached out and said his main concern is that the Jeep function properly. My credit to Lithia and Steve for stepping up and doing the right thing.
I have learned that when dealing with Lithia it is best to approach management personally when the other paths have closed.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Wolves in sheep's clothing! Buyer Beware!!! I'm not one to write reviews much, or talk bad about anyone or any company, but in this case I cant help but feel the need to warn those who might be fooled by this car dealership. Let me begin with, this is not the first car my wife and I had purchased from a dealership, it is the third. I have nothing but good things to say about the other dealerships I have purchased from. Lithia Chrysler had us fooled, we traded in our beautiful dodge caliber because we needed an AWD or 4 wheel drive vehicle, they showed us a used 2006 Jeep Commander, they were very reluctant to let us view other options, this should have been a warning of how badly they wanted to get rid of this "lemon" It seemed to fit the bill of what we needed so I went ahead and questioned them on everything mechanically about the Jeep, asking about the records and services done. They sold me like a snake oil salesman, informing me that they wouldn't sell anything that wasn't 100% reliable and up to their "high" standards of running and driving. They showed me their evaluation of the car and the things they had done bringing the jeep up to their standards, which included rebuilding the sunroof due to "excess wind noise" They had me convinced it was perfect. Well during the first little rain we had the roof leaked as if the rain clouds themselves had occupied the interior of the car, we had roughly a half inch or water soaking the floorboards, water was literally dripping out of every seam and opening of the the jeep's tan cloth and plastic interior. Come to find out that not one piece of weatherstripping on any door, nor sunroof, nor dual rear passenger moonroofs was any good, ALL OF THEM LEAKED! That hurt my pocket book, but that was simply the beginning! The water damage also hurt the sound system causing the speakers now to sound crackly and underwater, It also harmed the interior roof mounted rear monitor back up display. I had tried and tried contacting the group of men who sold me the faulty vehicle but they stopped returning my phone calls and emails, I lived too far away to simply bring it back for them to look, and worse yet they were not willing to help. Within a couple thousand miles of purchasing the jeep the water pump went out! Again this caused me to open the pocket book when we were in a financially fragile spot. Not long after that the transmission began acting up, the fault being in the AWD/4-wheel drive computer... Soon after the water pump and transmission acting up, the engine itself began having problems due to a faulty TPS "Throttle Position Sensor"
So with a barren pocketbook, we again were forced to act. We have now dumped more money into the Jeep Commander than it is worth. We are belly up, unable to afford a replacement and in more debt because of this car than I care to mention.
STAY CLEAR OF THIS DEALERSHIP AND THE CROOKED MEN YOU MAY FIND ON THE PROWL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU THERE!!!!!<//Text>< name>

<Text>My wife and I had a great experience with Lithia. The sales team is great, all very friendly and we never visited the dealership without someone coming out to greet us and make sure we were taken care of. Don’t know about anyone else out there but this is definitely not the normal trend at all dealerships. We, in fact, visited some other local stores and nobody came out!! Special thanks and appreciation to Anthony (Tony) and Kent. Great guys and always there for us. Tony, over the top. I was very indecisive about my jeep purchase, new, used, sport, sahara…..Drove my wife nuts, but Tony was very patient and hung in there throughout the entire process, Thanks Man!!! . The finance manager, Tsoai (Soey) Gordley is also a great guy to deal with, super friendly and knows his stuff. Could not have been a better experience for us. We definitely will be visiting them for our next vehicle purchase. Also want to thank Steve Fox for two things; a great deal on our new jeep rubicon and also for running such a fantastic dealership. 5 star rated. Keep up the fantastic job guys!!!

<name>Adam McClean</name><text>I purchased my Dodge Ram Truck 2500 in May 2015. I also purchased a lifetime oil change plan and maintenance plan from Steve Archer for $8000 through Dodge Lithia. stating that I can go to any Dodge dealer and have my oil changed at no cost. I called 2 weeks ago to schedule an oil change through  Lithia Santa Rosa. After scheduling I had to cancel because I was not going to be in the area for a few more weeks. Finance Manager David Henderson said that I could just go to whatever Dodge dealership was near to me. So here we are in Lakeport, and they cant find our service agreement stating that Dodge will take care of the lifetime oil changes. My first oil change, and I cant get a hold of anyone at Lithia Dodge Santa Rosa to verify that we do indeed have the plan., I leave messages for Henderson and Tsoai, the other finance manager. After having to call back a few hours later again, Tsoai states that it was a mistake on their part and they cant do anything about it. It was a miscommunication with Beck? And as of 2 weeks ago Henderson made the same mistake by telling me I had that same "plan" and now I don't? Horrible Customer Service. Would not recommend this place to people I know. Its sad when you spend money like that you are lied to and not appreciated. I am taking this issue further!</text>< resp>

The worst customer service ever first we got told we got  approved payment at 295 then got asked to provide personal information when we where there got what they wanted then we get told to send more info when we got home via text message to jarret garrigan we called them in the morning the next day and they tell us we will call back in a half hour never got a call so we called back and get told by the finance manager that he is the one that determines which bank is going to approve us in that if we keep calling that He will end the deal so buyers beware don't send them any info or  Business or sales Worst dealership to deal with and very rude finance managers< /Review>

Incompetent bungling idiots

Wasted 45 minutes there because they couldn't find my appointment, couldn't find my special order parts and turns out they sold them.<//Review>

Very BAD service . If you make appointment at 10am be ready to leave at 12 or 1 pm. There is no point on doing an appointment  because they'll take you in at their time not your appointment time. 👎< /text>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place, I was waiting more than 7 hours for an oil change and in the end they could only see my car damaged, all the oil went out, the service is fatal, nobody listens to you, they are not professionals and an apology does not fix the danger or the bad moment

(Original)
No recomiendo este lugar estuve esperando mas de 7 hrs para un cambio de aceite y al final solo pudieron aver dañado mi carro todo el aceite se salio el servicio es fatal nadie te escucha no son profesionales y una disculpa no arregla el peligro ni el mal momento</review>
