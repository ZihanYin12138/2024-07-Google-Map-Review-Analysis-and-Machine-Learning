I had the opportunity to work with Judy on a quick loan I needed.  The whole process was smooth and she was always very helpful.  Her professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile to help others makes her a wonderful person to work with.  I had a very positive experience and I'm so thankful that she was always there to answer all my questions in a timely manner.</review>

<text>Judy is quite simply one of the best people I've ever encountered in my life. While she handled our loan like a pro, she did so much more than that, she navigated us from one life into another life that we've envisioned for some time. In my search for a lender that would work with us to help us finance a a new home for doing private recovery retreats for our clients, I called Judy's company. From the moment I heard her voice I felt I was in the right place with the right person. Judy was immediately recognized as a highly intentional person who understood the outcomes I was going for and why it was so important for us. We immediately started to work together towards our goal and it was apparent that Judy knew what she was doing. I had thought I might need to contact a few lenders but it was clear I needed to look no further. I felt the kind of trust that is rare in this life and from what I understand it's rare in her industry. Judy had a loan for us within a day and we both worked efficiently and made fast progress that felt like we were in a true partnership. As a psychologist I can spot people who are purposeful and actually care about the people their serving and I felt so grateful that Judy was working with us as people working towards an important goal rather than just working on a loan. Then there was an shocking twist in the process where the sellers of the home we were buying were discovered to be doing fraudulent things in the transaction and just when our deal looked like it was going to be sabotaged Judy kept reassuring us that things were going to work out. Because of Judy's fast work our loan had been set to close in just a few weeks, and then with this new scenario it was unclear as to what was going to happen or how long it was going to take, Judy was an Angel here on Earth staying focused and helping us through a nightmare situation. Each day and multiple times per day Judy stayed connected with me to move things forward and give me direction as to what to do next. We were in sync the whole way through the process and Judy never wavered or lost focus. She is truly one of the most intentional and focused people Ive ever met. As someone who is always helping others stay focused on their goals I rate Judy as one of the most caring, professional, strategic people I've ever met. Over the course of several weeks where things were at their most stressful Judy navigated us through every step that was necessary until the last moment where our loan closed, which she made sure happened on a Friday night before we had to go through another nail biter weekend There were so many factors and elements going on with our loan, the sellers, and the sellers real estate agent and Judy orchestrated everyone through a process that needed a ring leader and a cheerleader, and that was Judy. Judy's expertise and her emotional intelligence made everything possible and now we are in our new home preparing for our first private recovery clients to receive their transformation into their new life. All of this is possible because Judy understood that she wasn't just working on a loan for us, she was helping us live our purpose of helping people in their time of need. Judy was the perfect collaborator to make the dream of reality and she is someone I will remember the rest of my life as more of a hero than a lender. I consider her a friend and she has an open invitation to visit us anytime she is up in Sonoma County. If I wasn't so busy I'd have flown down to where she lives and given her a hug for all that she did for us. I look forward to a day where I can thank her in person and I plan to make that happen. When you are looking for a loan to finance your dream, you need to look no further because Judy is an expert, an ally, a partner, a leader, a professional, a therapist, and a friend all in one amazing package. We will turn to Judy for any loans we do in the future, and for the rest of my life I recommend Judy to everyone I know. You can trust her, you can count on her, and you will absolutely love her.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1625292158457, 'text': "Wow. I'm speechless and that doesn't happen very often! I must say at times I did feel like I was a therapist even though  you are the actual doctor. There were more twists and turns than I could even bear. Everytime I could hear in your voice you were getting concerned I just wanted to make sure I was your rock so you wouldn't be discouraged. I knew things will work out in the end but that's easy for me to say.  Having been in the business for a number of years, I find there are always Solutions if you just stay focused. And don't think for a minute I'm not going to take you up on your offer to meet in Napa Valley. I am always happy to take advantage of any excuse to go to beautiful Wine Country.   After all of our trials and tribulations and conversations I did grow to care about you as a person. I would love the opportunity to meet you and your husband face to face as soon as humanly possible."}<//resp>< gmap_id>

I am a lender and I had the most unique scenario I could imagine.
I had a client purchasing a below market property.
The unique part was that the borrower had no down payment.
The property was in an very desirable location but had quite a bit of deferred maintenance. Even given that the loan to value was 61%.
I shopped it with several investors to no avail.
I called Judy and explained the scenario. She initially said no go and we talked further and really dug in to the details and to my amazement she found an investor and we closed!!! Kudos to Judy and California Hard Money Direct. Needless to say she is my go to investor for all of my hard money deals in the future!< /text>

My investor is safe and it's a win-win for everybody. I'm glad to hear I am officially your go to lender. Hopefully the next one will be a nice cookie cutter easy deal!"}<//resp></record>

<text>I don’t like to think of myself as someone who needs ‘handholding’,  but in this case, Judy’s expertise and professionalism provided just that! Judy was always available and quick to respond, which was especially comforting considering this was my first ‘hard money’ loan and commercial investment. She was super upfront with the fees and I never felt pressured. It might sound crazy but the whole process was actually fun!

It truly couldn’t have been more straightforward and simple. If you’re in need of financing I highly recommend Judy and her company. I know I will be using her again for my next investment!< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1603470904850, 'text': "Thank you for your kind words.

I had a pleasure of working with Judy, Francis and staff at hardmoney direct recently on a unique investment property here in Pleasanton downtown, California.

Since property is quite rare in this hot market, I had to close on 1.64MM purchase price relatively quickly. This is where I needed a very reliable + honest + dependable team. Along with my agent, Judy and her team helped close this property on time with utmost professionalism throughout. In fact, Judy had a couple of term options to fit my needs.

Btw, before my agent introduced Judy & team, I had approached another cash lender,  they quoted me for 11% APR and disappeared when I wanted to start app.

Absolutely coming back to this team if and when a need comes-up.< /Text>

At least when your previous lender disappeared there was still time to close your transaction . Some are not so lucky. Once the contingencies have been lifted and time runs out, buyers are at grave risk of losing their earnest money deposits. Needless to say, that can be very costly. Your quick turnaround time getting documents over to me and your agent sending me a well-organized loan file from day one made it a lot easier to close everything on time. I'm glad I was able to help and I look forward to working with you in the future should the need ever arise ."}</Response>< gmap_id>

I started working with Judy about 1 week before my loan contingency was supposed to be lifted.  I had two terrible experiences with other lenders and was in a bind, cant say enough how lucky I was to find Judy.  Her professionalism is unrivaled and her communication is everything you would want it to be.  She was simply incredible to work with and I would recommend her to anybody.

Judy was amazing from day 1. I initially reached out to California Hard Money, looking for a loan to purchase an investment flip. Compared to other lenders out there, Judy was confident and knowledgable about the California market. We ended up connecting back at a later time for a bridge loan; and her service was impeccable. The loan process was seamless, and funded almost immediately. Will definitely be contacting Judy again; and using California Hard Money Direct to fund our investment needs in future!< /Text>

Judy at California Hard Money Direct is a gem. From the very first positive review I read from other people I knew she could deliver the loan for me and indeed she did when another lender promised a loan and after 2 months could not. She was very helpful over the phone and available for any question I had and would get back to me right away. She went over and beyond to make sure the loan closes successfully. I would definitely recommend her and reach out for any future loan needs. She is very honest with lots of integrity.
Thanks again.</text>

<Text>Judy is a life saver!!

I was in the process of buying a property with a 30 year fixed conventional loan, 25% down, I have an almost 800 credit score and have never needed to get a hard money loan. The appraisal came it at asking price HOWEVER the estimated rents came in at $6600.. I would easily be able to rent these units at $11,000, so the appraiser did not do his homework and gave us very low rents. We only had a few days to close the deal, so I needed to close it quick as i'm going on a trip to Europe soon. I gave a call to many hard money lenders however Judy stood out the most. She's very kind and explains everything clearly. When she says she's going to get something done - she does! We were able to close in just 7 days and had no issues at all. Everyone she works with from the loan processor to the law firm who were drawing the documents were quick and responsive. If you need a hard money loan, this is the spot! Thank you Judy and Paul</Text><Resp>{'time': 1565235571074, 'text': "Thank you for acknowledging my team. It is a group effort for sure.

One fantastic thing you had going for you was your borrower had a track record of making all their previous loan payments on time with their existing hard money lender. I figured it was worth a shot. But I also told you up front I only had about a 20% chance of getting it done. I let you know right then and there I would try my best and it would only take me about three days to find out if I could get an investor interested. Good news is, I was able to get it done. I'm thrilled you reached out to me and I'm very happy I was able to help your borrowers."}</resp>

If you're looking for a home loan -- regardless of your credit rating -- call and ask for Judy Robbins.  She will tell you if you can get a loan or not.  If she says she can, you will get a loan, period. Straight talk, excellent communication, top notch service.

My latest loan with Judy is very remarkable. In order to win the bidding war in a very competitive San Francisco real estate market I had to make my offer with no contingencies. My deposit in the amount of $47,250 went into escrow and my fate was in the hands of Judy. If she had failed to secure the loan I would have lost that deposit. Wow, it was exciting! But no surprises at the end. She delivered what she promised with the calm professionalism. I know that I can trust Judy. She is very straightforward. She will tell you directly what she can do and what she cannot do. I would call this a "no nonsense" approach. To be completely honest, I never tried any other hard money lender: I was lucky to do my first hard money loan with Judy and since then I could count on her as a reliable source of hard money for my real estate purchases.<//Text>< pictures>

After getting an insanely expensive quote from another lender, I am so glad I searched further and found Judy at CA HARD Money Direct.  It was several points difference in fees! Judy was super efficient and she delivered what she promised.  I had my doubts about rates she verbally told me over the phone in our first conversation, but she had no problem when I requested that she reconfirmed it in writing for me right away before I proceeded with getting her what she needed.  There was no time wasting/convoluted language - just straight forward language which I greatly appreciated.  It was a very non-invasive transaction and we closed in approx. 2 weeks.  I will definitely use her for future real estate investments and refer her to my clients!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I reached out to several private lenders online.  Judy was among several that answered my inquiry regarding a loan of this kind.  She stood out! She was direct, nonevasive, honest and kept communication open. To her there were no weekends; she could be reached after 6pm! She cared for her clients, the investors, tremendously; nonetheless, she also made me, the borrower, feel that she had my best interest at heart — a tough balance to strike. The communication/update link was very helpful and made exchange of documents smooth. With a lot patience and education from her (and her team), today we were able to close on a complex loan on very fair terms. I highly recommend California Hard Money Direct.</text>< pics>

<name>Joseph Broderick< /name><review>There is various ways that you get to "Hard Money" lending.  Some by credit, some by income.  Another way is the type of property is unique and outside of normal lending guidelines.

Judy and her investor's were wonderful.  I had three condos in an condo project that is 100% investor owned.  If you talked to a normal bank about lending in the project you would have I though I owned a radioactive waste dump.  They would had no part of it and said no.

But Judy put together the last loan in together in less than 8 days.  Great work.  Many thanks to Judy, her staff, and investors.< /review></record></dataset><record>

It has been years since I dealt with ‘hard money’ lenders. The impression left on me was more of used car salesman.  I needed an investment loan and my credit had slipped (a lot) this year.  I actually had started with a broker who had my file for over 2 weeks and I hadn’t heard anything from them.  Annoyed, I started researching on my own and I came across California Hard Money and Miss Judy. We talked, she listened, I asked questions, she gave answers.  After our first phone call I felt comfortable.  She didn’t try and force the issue nor did she overpromise.  I found her extremely knowledgeable, professional and organized.  She will keep you informed, without pestering, she will give you honest responses and if she says she can do your loan, she’ll get it done! Miss Judy is hardworking and she respects her borrowers. At the end of my loan, tittle had last minute requests the Friday before a three day holiday.  Miss Judy was there every step of the way.

I can’t say enough about my experience with Miss Judy.  As a consumer, I read reviews, check complaints etc. All of her 5 ⭐️reviews are accurate and sincere.  We live in a world where we are quicker to complain than compliment.  The best compliment I can bestow will be as a repeat borrower.  I plan to pick up more projects and working with Miss Judy will be the only way I would delve into  this business.</text>

All kidding aside, I'm thrilled I was able to help you. It's always  a bit harder to start on a loan when somebody has already had a bad experience. I say this because often time the borrower is a bit jaded and skeptical as to whether  anybody is going to  be straight with them. I never doubted I was going to be able to help you. I'm just  happy you believed in me  and we're willing to start over again. Now you have your money and you can implement your plans.

<UserId.>117498332367164887027</UserId.><text>There are times when a "hard money loan" makes sense. When it does, the last thing you want to do is chase your tail with an unscrupulous vendor that will charge too much and may not be able to close the loan.  I needed to pull equity out of a condo for a couple of rehab projects I have going and I’m very happy with my results from California Hard Money Direct. I would absolutely use them again.  The closing process was well organized, and the pricing allowed the numbers to pencil out on the project.   Thanks again.< /text>< name>

I have been doing hard money since I was licensed in 1997. And in the past few years I have dealt with several hard money groups who did not meet the expectations they created. California Hard Money Direct was an outstanding team. That was not only fast but upfront. I shopped my client with three other investors over two months. This group was able to come through quickly. If you are looking for hard money in California call Judy and her team first, you will not be disappointed.<//Text>

Thanks Judy for all your help throughout this process. For being our first time in acquiring a hard money loan it was a bit nerve- racking to say the least. You were very upfront from inception  of our conversations till the closing of our loan. You and your team were always accessible and responsive to any of our questions. Although all loans can present their own individual challenges, you hung in there with us until closing. Once again thanks for your patience and professionalism . Continued success to you and your team!!!<//Review>

<review>Judy is an absolute life saver.  She was quick and efficient in getting a loan to bail me out of an impending tax sale on an investment property.  The banks would not give me a loan due to bad credit and if it was not for Judy's quick and efficient manner in getting the loan, I would have lost the property.  Thank you Judy, I am forever grateful.<//review>< Pictures>

We had a wonderful experience with Judy, the process went very quickly until the seller got difficult. It was an older house on 20 Acres and nobody would touch it even with my good credit. The communication was excellent and any time we needed an answer she was right there for us. We could not have done it without her. Thanks so much.</Review>

I have just closed 4th loan with Judy. She was able to arrange this one with the money that came from the same investor who did my 3rd loan. I refinanced my previous purchase and money was wired to the investor’s bank account. It stayed on her account for a couple days and was wired to the new escrow to fund my new purchase. Wow, Judy is so efficient!  Because of her outstanding professionalism people like me can win bidding wars in very competitive markets like San Francisco and at the same time the investors’ money is working non-stop earning very good return. It is a win-win situation. Thank you, Judy for making this process so smooth. Can't wait to do my next loan.<//text>
<Response>{'time': 1511391882118, 'text': "I'm always thrilled to work with you because you are so incredibly efficient! You actually make my job fun.\n\nOn a side note, I get asked all the time why do people like you with FICO scores close to 800 need hard money lenders. You are the poster child for a why Savvy investors choose hard money. Time and time again you've  successfully been able to outbid even cash buyers. Because you structure your offers with 14 to 21 day closing times and no contingencies other than appraisal your offers are repeatedly getting accepted even above cash offers. Not an easy task in this competitive market. No Bank could ever be depended on to close loans structured this way on time. As such, the next best choice is close with private money and refinance months later into a conventional loan. This has been a winning strategy and I look forward to helping you with the loan number 5 whenever you're ready."}< /Response><user_name>Vladimir Brodskiy< /user_name>< gmap_id>

<Text>I am an experienced Real Estate Consultant and have worked with many, many lenders throughout my career, and great lenders are few and far between. My business partner and I had an unbelievable opportunity to purchase a home to lovingly restore and resell. We came to Judy Rae upon several recommendations from long time mutual friends. Judy was amazing throughout the entire process. I felt as though we did not need to lift a finger, so that we could concentrate on our jobs of being stellar real estate professionals. Judy handled the transaction with ease and grace and I was completely satisfied. CHMD had competitive rates and all around treated us fairly. We had such a great experience with Judy Rae, that we have used her since and we could not be happier. It's really nice to know that you have someone championing for you on the not so easy, and very tricky side of lending money when absolutely needed. I would highly recommend Judy and California Hard Money Direct to my family, friends and most of all my trusted clients. Thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

I called California Hard Money Direct and spoke with Judy Rae, she spoke with me regarding my situation. She was professional and straight forward, she wasted no time in getting moving on the steps to help me through the loan process.  She has a team of dedicated and knowledgeable professionals that all worked seamlessly to make my loan happen. She even found me a convenient place to close my loan as I was traveling.

Judy at CA Hard Money Direct was quick, direct, and “all business” when it came to doing my loan. I shopped my loan around extensively and found that: 1) Judy gave the most comprehensive and direct answers, 2) Judy’s approach was "no nonsense" approach, 3) Judy provided fair pricing, and 4) Judy competed for my business and was eager to do a good deal for all parties. I would highly recommend Judy as she stands out as a superior broker in the Hard Money lender space.< /text>

Now keep in mind, we started this process on the last week of December and went into a little bit of January.  Usually things slow down during the holidays.  Not Judy, her and her team  was on it!  She also recommended an Appraiser, Ira, and Ira was super fast!  He went to the property the next day!  And again, this is during the holidays!  Great guy, easy to get along with.

In this day and age of ridiculous hoop jumping with banks just to get a real estate loan I can't believe how fast, easy, efficient this company was.  I have a mid 700 credit score and assets and still couldn't get a conventional loan because I am self-employed.
CHMD had me funded in less than two weeks.  My mortgage broker was Judy and she was direct, forthright and incredibly responsive.  I recommend this company to anyone who needs help getting a loan.  You will pay a higher interest rate than a bank but you will get your loan quickly.<//review>

Judy and the rest of the CA Hard Money Direct team came in and saved the day when another lender cancelled on my loan deal less than 2 weeks before we were scheduled to close escrow on an investment property in Palmdale! The other guys made promises they couldn't keep, and when it came down to funding, they dropped the ball and wanted to arrange a terrible deal with me. As you can imagine, I was stressing out because I had negotiated a great deal on this property and was worried I may lose the property if I couldn't arrange financing in time! CA Hard Money Direct team came in and worked quickly to get me taken care of. We closed just a couple days past my original estimated close of escrow date, which is impressive considering I called them so last minute! I appreciated their urgency to help me out and they made it so easy to keep up with where we were in the process, that even the novice investor will find them so easy to work with! Judy was very thorough and explained everything very clearly. I felt I could trust her, and my intuition didn't forsake me, for she delivered on her promises and followed up often to ensure I was happy.

Although this wasn't the MOST affordable loan out there, I would definitely use CA Hard Money Direct again because they are reliable and easy to work with. They didn't take my situation lightly and had it not been for them, I could have potentially lost a really great deal. I have already recommended them to other investors. When it comes down to it, I would choose reliability and trustworthiness over other places that make promises they can't keep and could cost you your entire deal!

I am looking to make a nice profit on this deal in Palmdale, and I am thankful for CA Hard Money Direct for helping this all come together.< /review>

Judy is wonderful and I had a terrific experience with California Hard Money Direct. They helped make the impossible possible when no other lender would lend a helping hand.  Judy kept me informed at every step of the process and actually responded to my emails and phone calls immediately. Her concerns about my unique and difficult situation were genuine and provided me with comfort during the most difficult times. Judy and her team at CHMD reflect the values and integrity that are vastly lacking within the mortgage industry. Without hesitation, I can wholeheartedly recommend CHMD to anyone in need of a mortgage under any circumstances. Don’t hesitate to give them a call today. You’ll be glad you did!< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Thank you Judy for acquiring funding for our Purchase of a luxury condo in Los Angeles CA.  Judy was able to get me a $1.785 million loan, 65% LTV, with very little docs as it was an SFR investment property.
This was a celebrity client with many demands.
I would highly recommend Judy to anyone needing a loan fast and with the utmost professionalism.  Judy will stay on top of your loan and work it till the end.
I have been disappointed by many lenders who drag you along with no real funding source.
Judy is the REAL DEAL with REAL INVESTORS.
It was a pleasure to work with her and all of my California loans go to Judy first from now on. There is no need to go anywhere else.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I have been working with Hard Money Direct and Judy Rae for four years. I now trust that any questions I have will be promptly answered and conscientiously addressed. This applies to the review process for a new loan as well as any issues that might arise with existing loans. While I might have hesitated to invest in what some consider high risk investments, every transaction has been beneficial. At this point, when a borrower pays off the loan, I reinvest it with CHMD. I highly recommend Judy and her team.<//Text>< Pics>

All I have to say is WOW, Judy did a great job. The seller was a bank , and they were not being easy at all. We had a short time to come through with the loan. Let me tell you , I had my doubts. But it all worked out and California hard money direct came through. Thank you.   I diffenently would use them again on the next flip in California.       Thank you again Judy.  Great job.</Review>

I must admit I was a bit nervous on this one given the stringent time parameters and zero flexibility with regard to even the hope of a one-day extension. Our appraiser appraised the property at $5,000 more than you paid for it so you're already off to a good start. Considering the upgrades you have planned for the house you stand to make a very nice profit. I look forward to seeing the after pictures. Please reach out to me in the future, I'm here for you for your next flips as well."}<//response>< user>

I have been doing hard money since 2014. I got this deal on 12/21/2017. The borrower needs to COE within 8 days include holidays. I cannot find my investors during Christmas Holiday. I called Judy to help me on the Thursday prior to Christmas with an emergency closing needed by 29th. It is almost impossible to accomplish, but we have successfully completed this transaction. My client and their realtor are so happy with that. Judy was super helpful, efficient & reliable. Thanks Judy for all your help.</review>

< review>
I am a real estate investor with 5 properties in California.   We were turned down by conventional lenders for a refinance on a single family rental home for reasons of lack of reserves on each of our properties and a discount of 25 percent of our rental income.  Judy Rae found us a private investor who would loan us the money to pay off our first and some cash back.  We are very lucky to find Judy Rae among a dozen of private finance offers with other companies.  When you are in a time crunch you do not have time to waste on hollow offers.  We now have an additional source of capital if the situation warrants.  Judy gave us the confidence to let her do her work to secure financing for our specific situation.  We did not give up and neither did Judy Rae.  Great job Judy</review>

I will try to keep this as short as possible but it will truly be difficult to do as I have so many great things to say about Judy and her team at California Hard Money Direct.  As a Conventional and FHA guy I have learned to ABSOLUTELY hate dealing with hard money lenders as none of the 40+ lenders I have spoken to ever could do what they said they could do.  Until Judy... when I first spoke to Judy and she told me that ''she would save the day" all I can think of was..''sure... here we go again!"  Not ONLY did she save the day...but she saved the day in the fastest and easiest way I could imagine.  Her deals were smooth...they were fast...and they were at better rates and terms than any of the other lenders that couldn't do what they could do could offer.  I have went from absolutely hating hard money deals to actively searching for this kinds of scenarios so that I will have the opportunity to work with Judy and her team again.  Thanks for making me a believer Judy!!!<//review>

Special thanks to Judy Rae and Company at California Hard Money Direct.  After multiple attempts to refinance with other financial institutions; Judy and Co. were literally a breath of fresh air. Extremely helpful and unlike other lenders, Judy worked diligently for my family's best interest.  Our last lender was rather dubious in their intentions, thus if you're in the process of looking for a trust worthy institution, I highly recommend Judy and California Hard Money Direct. Communication was outstanding, more importantly they were highly transparent and answered all my questions.  Judy even managed to give me a lower interest rate compared to other lenders. I suggest you give them a call. Thanks Judy! - Samir P. Samano<//text>

I am a Realtor in Northern California and I was at the end of my rope, because my Buyer was tough to get approved. She has a business and wanted to buy a house I found and fix it up and flip it. Well the lender I was using, had a difficult time, with actually getting it through. Sometimes, things are just more difficult and you need a lender that can think way outside the box and this was Judy. I have to admit, I called her one night out of complete desperation and I cannot believe it actually all worked out. She was honest and completely upfront about what she could do and she did just that. Thanks Judy for actually answering the phone at 8pm at night. Stacy Kendrick< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Judy Robbins worked with me, she was completely unethical. From our first call I was clear that I am looking for a Fixed 30 year loan with a rate lower than what I already have (8.99% fixed for 30 years). AFTER she checked my credit, she replied with the following offer by email:
"Dear Sameh,
The lender has conditionally approved your loan.  They are approving you for a loan based on 70% Loan to value.  They used the value of $500,000 when they did the numbers.  If your property appraisal comes back higher than $500,000 you will get more money and if it comes back at less your number will drop.  For now, they approve you for a loan of $350,000 based on a $500,000 value.  Interest rate will be 8.24% fully amortized for 30 years.  Plus 2 points, $1995 underwriting, $600 loan processing & $795 for administrative fees.  You will need to pay for the appraisal directly to the appraisal company.  I will need to arrange it for you.  I don't have the cost for it yet but it will somewhere between $595.00 & $750,00."
This was clear to me that the loan interest is 8.24% for the life of the loan. She NEVER mentioned adjustable rate.
But when I received the loan approval letter today, I found out that it is for a 3 year ARM, then adjustable rate every 6 months. And to make things worse, after I confronted her with the facts, she tried to blame me that I told her that my credit score was higher, but she had already run my credit BEFORE sending me the above quoted email. And even worse, she tried to say that English is not my first language and that I misunderstood her, and that proves that she is a racist because of my accent. Very unethical and low class service.<//review>< pics>

I contacted California Hard Money Direct and spoke with Judy.  She told me she would get the loan closed in one week.  She closed it in 4 days.  I truly think she is the best of the best and only wish I would have found her earlier.<//Text>< Pics>

Judy has restored my faith in the mortgage brokerage/banking industry! As a Real Estate Broker, I was stuck in an extremely tough position with my client. My transaction was teetering on the edge of collapse and my client’s “VERY LARGE” earnest money deposit on the line when I stumbled upon California Hard Money Direct (CHMD). My client and I were locked in a 45-day escrow and It wasn’t until the last two weeks when the first lender we were working with pulled back the curtain revealing that they were a bunch of crooks. With only 2 weeks left, “TWO WEEKS!!” I made first contact with Judy at CHMD. Keep in mind this was an owner-occupied consumer loan that required 35% down payment, with only “TWO WEEKS” to go! Suffice it to say, my client had lost all hope at this point and I was stuck in a position of having to pull a rabbit out of my hat. My persistence paid off big time!!! As you very well have assumed by now, CHMD was able to push my transaction through at light speed and we closed 19 days later, which includes two weekends and one holiday. Judy and the whole team at CHMD saved the day!

I can wholeheartedly recommend CHMD to anyone looking for that perfect niche product backed by a solid group of uber professionals that take pride in their work who truly…. truly care for their client’s needs. Judy is very attentive to the needs of the client. She returns calls and emails immediately and actually answers the phone when you call, a lost art in this industry if you ask me. My experience with CHMD has been nothing short of extraordinary and I look forward to working with them again. Moving forward, they are now my preferred lender for all niche products.< /text>

It is true when you contacted me there were only two weeks left before your house was scheduled to be sold at auction. You described your prior lender involved you in a loan whereby the rate was supposed to be fixed yet it turned out to be variable. Not just variable but variable to the point that it skyrocketed so far up you were unable to make the payments. By the time you got to me you were so far behind with payments you needed what is known as a foreclosure bailout loan. These are amongst the most difficult to do however I was able to get it done in the nick of time. You already had your home on the market for sale so we were able to clearly determined you had an exit strategy in place. This is one of the key components in being successful with a foreclosure bailout. Lenders like to see there is a means to an end. You and your wife had more than just an exit strategy. Your house was beautiful, sitting with tons of equity and already on the market. We were confident it would sell and you would be out of your mess shortly. You just needed help quickly. I will admit there were some sleepless nights on my part over your deal. It's easy to get attached to people when you hear their stories and you can tell they are  good people that bad things happened to. It would have made me sick for the two of you to lose all your money and your house. I'm thrilled I was able to get you on the path with a fresh start. And now I'm even more excited to know you've received a very good offer to sell your home. It will be wonderful for you two to downsize and not have all the stress you've been living with for the past year."}<//Resp>

This should have been posted a month ago. i would like to take a moment to share my experience with judy rae on our recently closed transaction. without reservation judy is the finest loan officer i have ever met. and this is coming from a guy who has worked for and owned mortgage companies and been in some form or fashion associated with the hard money world for the past 30 years. . her attention to detail and even the simple task of answering her phone every single time i called was a breath of fresh air when in todays world you can never talk to anyone . cal hard money direct is lucky to have her.

This place was so packed when I walked in. The line was to the back of the store and there was a person doing returns and one person checking . Their fitting rooms aren't open and they expect you to buy items that potentially don't fit you. Their selection was non existent and the people working were rude.< /Review>

This particular Ross was extremely busy between 5:15 and 6:30 PM today. The customers didn't seem at all concerned about social distancing. Aisles are close and no one considers stepping aside or going down another aisle if someone is already in the narrow aisle. They have a big sign in the window that they are hiring. Line to register went in an L-shape down to bedding area. Don't assume people have left to dinner at this hour.  I worry for the health of the cashiers. I really like Ross for their low prices, but for the crowd, i would recommend that you go on an off hour if there is such a thing. Dressing room was closed.<//text>

School shopping. Store has greater selection of brands I wanted to look for than Vallejo or Vacaville. Sizes are much better organized so quicker to find what you need and there are actually people on the floor working who can direct you to exactly what you need, including electronic accessories.  They also take the time to greet you beyond the person at the front door. Seems to be a more positive, pleasant staff here as well, which makes needing to follow thus much less arduous. They were efficient and when lines started to backup called and received backup fairly quickly. Overall find everything I needed, was an actually pleasant experience and there's plenty of parking. My only irritant is the inability to take out a cart with your stuff. You either buy bags or can't shop fir much cause the alarm sounds if you even try to go out the door with ANY toe of cart or store tote.</text>

<Text>It was very crowded. Most places are just before Christmas. Eclectic mix of household goods, toys, clothing and other odds and ends. I got shoes, sheets, toys, and some dishes. While shopping I look up the items I plan on buying on my smartphone and see If the Ross "Sale" price is lower than what I can find online. Saved $67.54 on the same or comparable items online prices.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808506dd47e37897:0xa369c8faaf13a066< /gmapID></record>

It's a hit or miss w/ the Ross here in town.  I mean don't get me wrong, I love me some Ross, but some of their merchandise doesn't make my cut, price good or not.  Not their fault, I just have to keep looking to find the treasure.  It's okay as far as up-keep, could be the time of day I go or the day I go, but their staff is pretty nice and I usually find a couple items, of course not the ones I intended to get prior to walking in, but hey, I like finding treasures.< /Text>

Tuesday Club such a big draw. One drawback - don't think that just because you find something there once that it will ever be there again. If you like it, buy it when you can.<//review>

What's the point of closing at 11 when you can't try the things you picked out on before they close. Stupid policy. I had 3 items ready 15 minutes before closing and they wouldn't let me try it on. I'm a guy and it would have taken me 2 minutes max. Might as well change the closing time to 10:30<//Text>

I go there only when I am looking for something unique and have all the time in the world to stand in line. It is crowded and unorganized. But if you are looking for a bargain, shop Ross. I don't know if it is just the Napa store or all the stores, but the one in napa is always messy.< /Text>

Years ago the prices were reasonable.  Now a days though most of the items are outrageously over priced.  A pair of shorts is 13.99..if you drive to Vallejo the same shorts at half the price.. Hmmm</text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>This place strips away your peace of mind. I've been accused of drug dealing because my neighbors would come over a lot. But they called it heavy foot traffic. I've heard of other neighbors being accused of drug dealing with no evidence of it what so ever. Then  after living here for awhile and working on my cars in front of the different managers we've had.  I get told I can't even change my brakes out on my car. I can understand not being able to do an oil change. But I can't even do simple maintenance. I feel like we wasted money buying here. We own our home so we are kind of stuck in our 10 year lease until we sell our house. Until then I have to keep paying space rent and property tax for BS< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< time>

< Review>
Agustin, is a rare kind of man who cherishes each customer with integrity value and sharing knowledge. I am grateful to him in helping with tax as its hard to navigate yet he made me feel comfortable and at ease. My cousin recommended him to me and now I see why she has been going to him for years. An angel within the city who needs to be recognized for his business and service.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Time>1582785560005< /Time><text>My wife and I have been coming to this place over 15 years and this man Agustin never changes. Great service and very informative. Goes by the book but strives to get you back all that you have coming legitimately without breaking any laws that can come back and hurt you or his business. Do consider that he is always busy so make your appointment and if it's a walk in try and do it in the AM. With that said if you are looking for an income tax return office we highly recommend it. Thanks and have a blessed day.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Great service. 5 star professional, very knowledgeable. Answers all your questions, so you leave with no doubts and the peace of mind that your taxes are done right! His wife greets you when you walk in, and sets your appointment when you call in, also very nice and kind. They do accept walk in's, but it is very recommendable to make an appointment before hand. A lot of returning clients, as soon as they finish filing with Don Agustin, they are at the front scheduling and getting their name penciled in for next year!</text>

I was referred by a friend and very pleased. Honest and easy going.  Parking might be a bit of a challenge,  but nothing I'd complain about.  I will definitely return next year.</text>

Agustin is an honest, humble, and sweet Tax Preparer. I live in the Coachella Valley and will drive 2-3hrs to file here because I feel comfortable and trust him. Been coming to Ibero since 2007 and not going elsewhere! He is bilingual English and Spanish. I have also referred friends and family. Recommend to make an appointment ahead of time due to his busy day with loyal customers. Agustin thank you for all you do.< /Text>

Best service in all of Los Angeles! Very friendly, helpful, honest, and affordable. Make sure to make an appointment because Agustin has a lot of loyal customers and the wait can get long if you expect to just walk in. I've been doing my taxes with him for almost 20 years.<//Review>

<review>For many years I have gone with Agustin I drive 2-3 hrs just to do my taxes with him never had a problem he's honest straight forward I recomend him 100%. Make an appointment and you'll be in and out, walk in's may sit for a while but he'll definitely will try his best to see you.</review>< user>

This is my favorite ramen place in Torrance. I always get the spicy miso base with a combo bowl. It hits the spot when you just want a quick bowl of delicious ramen. It's located in the Mitsuwa supermarket and has a large seating area in the food court.< /Text>

<Text>Their salt base soup ramen is really good. You can also offer a combo if you please for a couple bucks more. The combo comes with a rice/side dish and egg. I opted out so I had room for ice cream after.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdZbRqfm3BL6ncERJCcLX55W73ey1cBRZ_fmEa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<review>This place consistently serves tasty ramen. I love getting the spicy miso ramen combo with the salmon and roe rice. My trips to LA are not complete without stopping here.

<Text>Delicious and consistent ramen at this cash only spot. The combination with a bowl of chashu or salmon is the perfect amount of food. The flavored egg is also included in this combination. Love coming here because I can grab lunch and then shop for all my Japanese grocery needs.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq0FawpTWtA0QtK-U02NdZwW8ExWD2YvCd6I0k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Was a little disappointed.  The soup lacked flavour.  The Pork Cheeks were really salty and did not have that fragrance I was expecting.  Maybe I was just expecting too much.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Noodles cooked to al dente perfection. Robust flavors, but the ramen is a little on the heavier side. Definitely go for an extra side of pork.<//Text>< Pics>

Really rich ramen broth, with some super savory pork bowl with rice and soy sauce egg.... this place is easily my favorite ramen places to visit anytime I am around the area.  Sadly this is the last day that it will be here in Mitsuwa. However do not fret! Its just moving down to the  Del Amo mall area. I hope that the flavors and quality will also make the move successfully as I hope to return and try it again at the new location.< /Review>

<Review>Good prices for generous portions of ramen noodles. Broth was good but not exceptional. Know that they are cash only, and the only nearby ATM charges $3 for withdrawals.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I'm always looking for new tasty ramen spots but time after time, very few stack up to Santouka. The broth is always super flavorful and the meat is not too fatty or porky. The best part is the easy access and convenience - no need to wait in lines longer than a few minutes and no service issues to worry about.

Also a huge fan of the cold ramen noodles in the summer. Took me a while not to order spicy miso but but was I glad that I did. Of all the ramen spots in Torrance, Santouka is still my go to.</Review>< Pics>

Great ramen spot, I got a spicy soy based broth with a rice bowl. Food was good, this place takes cash only and no Bill's over $20 even if your total is $52, they won't take the $50 bill heads up!< /Review>

<Text>Best toroniku in LA. The pork cheek was scrumptious. The soup base was good but not special. Too salty but not enough umame. The noodles were good if you prefer a more egg-y taste than wheat-y taste.</Text>< rate>

Arguably the best Ramen place in Southern California. Nestled inside Mitsuwa's food court, Santouka Ramen is a must try gem. The line can get along but it definitely moves fast. Either way, well worth the wait. I usually get a set with a side as well.< /Review>

Enjoyed the ramen very much! The other ramen store near it and santouka are both great rivals when it comes to ramens, but I believe that santouka probably takes the title for best ramen in the mall. I recommend the salt flavor and purchase some extra spicy oil to mix in with it its the best.< /Text>

<Review>A friend told my wife about this place and she felt like ramen that day.  we walked around looking for it twice, expecting a big sign it bold letters, we came to find out that is was a small sign about a foot long to the left of the space.   The wife and I got the shoyu ramen w/ pork on the side and it was surprisingly delicious.  Maybe it was because I didn't expect much but I would come here again.   It does get busy but they are very efficient, come try this place.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

The ramen is delicious every time! Doesn't matter which broth (they are all different and delicious!) or if get extras, it's always a perfect bowl of ramen! The sides are mediocre and so-so but if you want good ramen you'll be happy. Bro g cash, because that's all they take!<//text>

Quality went downhill in this food court. Maybe it was a weekday and business was slow. The soup tastes watered down and not as flavorful compared to when I had it a year ago. At least the noodles are chewy for the first 5 mins or so. After a while, it's soft. Just personal preference of liking my noodles al dante.<//Text>

<text>The spicy miso ramen is excellent. Definitely will come back for that and to try the others.  There's a bit of a wait for the line at lunch, and more wait for the food to be prepared. In total I think I waiting 45 minutes.

I don't know why, but I really like this place. The udon/ramen broth is pleasant tasting and this small business provides a large variety of choices. I usually pick the miso broth and go from there. Lots of choices so it might take a few minutes to go through the entire menu.</review>

Known for being one on the best ramen joint in Torrance, Santouka is like a firework of deliciousness exploding in your mouth. You will be hard-pressed to find a broth anywhere else as rich and deep as theirs. Ordering is simple: pick your broth style, the accompanying donburi (salmon and chashu are the best), and finally your size. They even have a chart to make this process even easier. Then get ready to give your taste buds the ride of their lives. Seating is abundant seeing how the store in part of a food court, but it does tend to get pretty crowded on weekends. Unfortunately Santouka isn’t a well kept secret, so do expect a line and a bit of a wait time.</review>

Located inside the Mitsuwa food court. Lines vary throughout the day. I found that in the evening hours, after 7pm, the lines aren't too bad, especially weekday evenings. However, lunch is another story. Anyway, this past Tuesday evening, there was NO line!

The "popular" items are pictured on the wall. I ordered #21, miso ramen, $8.95. The soup base was just right, not too salty, and not too weak. One of my favorite parts is the chopped green onions. The ramen itself has great texture of not being too chewy or hard. The pork was just ok, could have been slightly softer, but not a deal breaker of my meal.

Cash only and no bills bigger than $20.</Text>

<Review>Located in the food plaza of Mitsuwa Marketplace, this is a somewhat hidden gem.  There is quite the variety of Japanese restaurants in this plaza, but you'll find the most Japanese businessmen lining up for Santouka.  Try their ramen (I like their spicy ramen) and you'll know why.</Review>< Pictures>

Very well made ramen for the price tag. They serve only both chicken and pork ramen, but not beef. They also offer a variety of ramen bases like salt, soy sauce, and misou based. The noodles are quite tasty and the base complements it very well. I gave 4 star because I feel they should serve beef for people than don't like to eat pork, like I.< /Review>

Roman lovers you must check out santoka ramen. Soup base is excellent! Always consistent execution here. I always get the shio (salt) ramen with favor egg and char-siu bowl (pork bowl). Ramen have just the perfect amount of toppings. Chashu, fish cake, mushrooms,  bamboo and green onions.

CASH ONLY and NO TAKEOUT< /review></record>

Not expensive as one of the other reviewers noted when compared to other area ramen joints. And considering Santouka is better than most of the others it's a good deal. Not that the Kimchee Ramen has only 20 total servings a day but it's terrific. For ramen inside of Mitsuwa you don't have another choice but at least it's a good choice. Def recommended for ramen fans.<//text>

<UserId.>112716875525074362674</UserId.><review>More Santouka? Yes please! Ironically, came here after the Ramen Yokocho festival in Torrance because we couldn't fill our bellies with over priced $8 mini sized ramens at the festival. But that event totally incepted(as in inception)  us with the idea of wanting to eat more ramen. Been meaning to come back to Santouka, and I remembered there was on nearby in Torrance. So that's how we ended up here.

Giving Santouka 5 stars for their Spicy miso ramen. I've had a spicy miso ramen at other places, and thus far, none were anywhere close to the magnitude of Santouka's. The spiciness does not over power the umami-ness of the delightful broth. Good balance, good sides in the bowl like chashu and other goodies. Best spicy miso ramen period.

Had their natto bowl on the side. Not a lot of people like natto because it's fermented. But I enjoy it very much. It's not really seasoned. So maybe a little salt or soy sauce could kick it up a notch? The fermented taste is very subtle, so don't add to much seasoning if you enjoy the aroma of natto.

My combo was about $12-13. It's not bad at all as far as value. We were the only ones that had the idea from Ramen yokocho fest. We saw some others that also came here after the event.< /review><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x80dd4aa523d10973:0x39965dd0d9ec79bb<//gmap_id>< Time>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Full of delicious ramen shop, divided into large and medium bowls, girls eat a small just right, the menu is divided into two parts, the upper row is to select the main meat: pork, pork cheeks and one forgot, and then pick the soup base: Soy sauce, salty, miso, spicy miso.
In the lower row of the menu, A~F is a ramen + bowl of rice, the male friends of the same family are super hungry, and ordered a copy.
I ordered the rightmost pork cheek meat, Pork cheek meat, a small bowl, and miso soup. The pork cheeks are placed on the plate and look dry. They are put into the hot soup and become soft and tender. The soup base is very strong. I like it. A piece of 13 yuan, a miss in Rama, is enough.

滿好吃的拉麵店，分大中小碗，女生吃一個小的剛好，菜單分兩個部分，上排的是挑選主要肉類:叉燒、豬頰肉還有一個忘了，再來挑湯底:醬油、鹽味、味噌、辣味噌。
菜單下排，A~F是一份拉麵+碗飯，同行的男生友人超餓，點了一份
我點最右邊的豬頰肉Pork cheek meat，小碗，味噌湯底。豬頰肉擺在盤上看起來乾乾的，放進熱湯內，變得軟嫩很好吃，湯底很濃我喜歡，一份13元多，在洛杉磯一解拉麵的思念，足夠了<//text>< pics>

< Review>
I started in the restaurant industry at an Italian restaurant and pizzeria. And have been in love with great quality pies since my late teens. I know that it is a franchise and has to follow the guidelines. I think the entire staff is under 25 and are not taking their jobs seriously.  I have come close to walking out several times with the wrong pie, poor presentation of product. They need an adult there to babysit and make sure the quality is good.</Review>

The lunch special offered on the order site was a 4 topping pizza and a drink but greys out all options after the first topping is selected. Since I was in a hurry just ordered with one hopping they would take the issue into account and discount it when I came to pick it up. The two people at the counter said they couldn't discount or offer a substitute even though I paid for 4 toppings. I went ahead and ate the pizza frustrated with the service and any attempt to rectify the situation. This was the second day in a row this happened and I've been a regular customer for weeks. I went back in a second time just to reiterate that this was not alright at which time the guy said he couldn't do anything because I ate the pizza. Funny how this didn't matter when I had not yet eaten it. I asked if I could get a discount on the next one. Still nothing. Obviously they don't care about their customers at all.<//review>

My order was a while waiting which was all right but when I came back 20 minutes ( they told me it would take), the pizza was dry and usually it's fresh and succulent but this was dry and cold,  there was no cheese on top so maybe they had a different cook but they need to check that out because Round Table is the best I thought,  but the prices have gone so High I ordered two personal pizzas which were $9 . and they charged me $12 and the small pizza was 20+,, Too high for dry- less cheese and cold pizza..will not be back at THAT place.<//review>

The last honest pizza? Not! First time experience was just mediocre. I ordered the Wabo Combo personal pizza and it was so so. Their oven seems to be uneven. The crust was cooked just right but the toppings undercooked. Crunchy vegetables with a pizza? Not my thing. I also got cheated on the artichoke hearts. What I got on my pizza were all tough, fibrous parts of the crown. The actual artichoke hearts were all manually removed as seen in the pictures. I know they are never sold like this. So this is a deliberate act from employees. So where are the hearts? I went over to check the salad bar and they don't serve artichoke hearts. It makes you wonder what they really do with the actual hearts or who ate them. Service was just acceptable. They all work for minimum pay and at the end of the day they all want to go home. The dining area was kept clean. You need a key to use the rest room so that was annoying. There's sufficient parking outside. My next visit here will be when I have no other place to go to.< /text>

<Review>Their pizza is usually very good. But we got one with ham & pineapple with the polynesian sauce they offered and it was terrible! We gave it to my cousins to eat and they too thought it was awful. The King Arthur one was great though.</Review></record>

<text>2 large for 60 bucks used coupon 40 something. I don't mind the price but the pizza look like it was on a diet. When you can count the toppings on the pizza or when you have to move the toppings around to cover some slice that don't have toppings. Anyways pizza here looks like they running out of toppings. You can count the toppings that's how little it is.i don't know what happen. Round table use to make good with full  toppings  so if you like pizza with toppings. This is not a place to go.</text>< date>

Upon showing up the the location the doors are closed. I called the number and before I could ask a question I was put on hold. A few minutes later a woman answered and informed me that this location is temporarily closed and that calls were being routed to their restaurant, it would have been nice for someone to say that as I placed my order for pick up!
Here’s the best part, I asked her for the address to figure out where the location is and she just said “you can google it, we are in San Leandro”; I took a deep breath and asked, calmly, I am paying over $100 for pizza and you can’t give me the address?
I kindly asked her to cancel my order (that was ready for pick up) and ended the call. Dear owners, of you have a lot of no-show’s this is why. I am disappointed because I love round table but I will never be visiting the Mayfair location solely based on this bad experience!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1593092337256, 'text': 'Christian, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

<Text>Absolutely awful service. Ordered a pizza at 1240 pm for a 130 delivery. 2 o'clock goes by and I call and busy signal. Fast forward it's now 5 pm still no food. Finally get ahold of someone claim they never got the order and we argue finally they find my order after about 10 minutes attempt to contact the driver and at this point I know longer want the pizza. No apologies just insinuations I made a mistake. Terrible service I'll never go here again.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I was racially profiled at this restaurant by Grace.  Edwin was trying to withhold the Manager's name and business info for me to  file a formal complaint.   If you are a person of color please don't give this place your money.   I am going to file a formal complaint with the corporate office.  Businesses, please train your employees. Dont ask for ID if you are not going to ask others for it, and please do not ask for ID if you are not going to read the information.  I accidentally gave Grace the wrong ID with my maiden name on it, she should have recieved my correct ID that matches my name on my bank card.  The correct ID was in my wallet.  Grace didnt bother asking anyone else for ID or signatures.  I caught Grace in her act and when I called her out on her mistake she was embarrassed and didnt apologize.  I have a successful career in SF but instead of being judged by my character, I am judged by the color of my skin.  I am so frustrated, no one especially any human should be treated like this.<//Review>

The last time I ordered, it was about 35 minute wait from the time we placed our order-no problem. While he was putting our order on the phone, 1 large pizza with 2 toppings cost $35. He said he’d be giving a discount and it came down to $30. This place is a rip off for a cardboard box pizza.<//Review>< Rate>

I say that so that you can have context for this next part. Whole ording our food the cashier was not engaging, provided sub-par customer service and then passed us off to her manager who gave us even worse service. When then wined a Caucasian couple be served after us with the warmest of greetings and given excellent customer service. Than another Afro American female ordered after and she got the same service we got....... someone needs to address this.< /text>< pics>

<text>I have ordered a couple times before with no problem. So I am giving it 2 stars for that. But I just tried to order pizza and was on hold for 16 minutes. Which is ok.. I get if you are slammed. But seeing as its only 3pm I don't think you guys were. My breaking point was when I called back and the girl said asked me to hold again. I asked how long the wait to place an order was because I had been on hold for over 15 minutes. She said ok I'll take your order now... But PUT ME ON HOLD AGAIN. "Stop playing with my emotions." *in big worm from Friday's voice. Not cool. I ordered from Porkers instead this time.</text>< pics>

<review>My experience was the worst first off I ordered a large pepperoni pizza with a  salad and fruit on the side they brought my pizza 20 mins late I only live 5-7 mins away from this location anyway he gets here and doesn't have change for my bill the pizza was dry and cold the salad just came with lettuce tomatoes and cucumbers  when i order everything on my salad that they have at their usual salad bar if you were to dine in.  they gave me 6 ice cubed sized melons 3 green 3 orange and 1 literally 1 grape. No plates or condiments I'm soooooo disappointed  I spent 30 dollars on this< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f91d482a11131:0x4c7b81c951ba770a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pizza was fine but expensive.  Employees had the door propped open on a rainy night in the upper 40s.  Everyone was wearing coats while eating.  This place has seen far better days.</Text>

<text>The pizza is delicious. The salad bar could use fresher items, like the ones in the Alameda Rountable. Overall I would recommend it if you are only going for the pizza. Oh and don't call to pre-order because they always put you on hold for a long time.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Badly cooked. Burnt, dry, skimpy on toppings, tasteless mess. And that was their flagship very pricey "King Arthur" . I am not criticizing the whole RTP chain, but this particular kitchen. I have eaten in other round table outlets and their pizza was fine.< /Text>

It's not that they were rude, as a matter of fact as a matter of fact those kids were pretty polite especially the little blue haired manager girl but they are advertised online as honoring a birthday personal pizza which they did not do along with several other Round Table chain restaurants that I had tried out and was very disappointed on my birthday but it wasn't those kids' fault.< /Text>

Took 50 minutes to bring the food then it was the wrong order. Called back the lady said the delivery guy just left & that he should be here soon. I only live 6 minutes away but it's been 30 minutes since he "left" & still no pizza! Terrible<//review>

<Text>The pizza is good, but expensive. As far as the delivery service, you will wait nearly an hour and cost you nearly $30 for a large pizza, which seems very high.< /Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) very very bad service, as soon as we arrived they ignored us, they did not ask us anything or give us the vienbenide, the employees continued talking and we kept waiting after a few minutes we decided to retire because they did not even have the courtesy of greeting us, or anything, I do not recommend not at all to this place they have no coordination or are ordered in what they said

(Original)
muy muy mal servicio, encuanto llegamos nos ignoraron  ,no nos preguntaron nada ni nos dieron la vienbenida, los empleados siguieron platicando y nosotros seguimos esperando despues de unos minutos decidimos retirarnos pues no tuvieron ni siquiera la cortesia de saludarnos, ni nada,  yo no recomiendo para nada a este lugar no tienen cordinacion ni son oerdenados en lo qe asen😟😟😟😟< /Text>

Called and talked to Ivan who was very helpful. Gave me the email address to place order and was able to pick up the order by 3pm the same day.  Reasonable prices and fairly quick service.  Very professional and courteous.  Thank you so very much for a pleasant experience.< /Review>

Nature’s owner Blake is unprofessional.  The products are overpriced, incorrectly delivered, and returns refused.  Direct quote from Blake “I run a $50 million dollar business, I don’t need your pennies worth of business.”
At end of call Blake still refused to replace or return the errors and threatened to take me to court.
Blake is willing to lose what was $5-$6k per week in orders for approximately $180 in returns and fixes.</Text>

<Review>Smh. They are kinda cheap but the guy that did my nails was rude and you could tell he was quickly trying to finish my nails. Now doing my fill, he kept getting close to my cuticles which now hurt on two fingers. He drilled them down when I asked to get the cut shorter. Then when he started filing they were crooked. I asked several times for them to be straightened. Now I wanted a matte but obviously I didn't trust it after the process so far. I got gel..which looked pretty but after seeing them in the light the tips and some of the sides needed more polish. I will never return here and I advise everyone to reconsider. Maybe he's new, I don't know. I normally spend a lot but that day I just refused to let this shop do anymore for me.< /Review>< pictures>

They provide many services including mani's, pedi's, eyelash extensions, and beautiful custom nail art. (Hombre and 3D) The entire staff knows what they're doing and does a great job! I've been coming here for services with Danny and Nancy for years. Highly recommended.

They don’t take into consideration the time they tell you. People work on a time limit. Do not just tell people that you’re not busy to get people on. I was told they didn’t have a lone and I waited 25 minutes getting my feet soaked for no reason.

Waste of time and unprofessional</text>

<Review>Very disappointed I paid $ 44 for the worst gel mani and pedi ever!! The only my reason I paid was because my boyfriends sister always comes here and I didn’t want to make her look bad by throwing a scene but I’m used to way better!</Review></record></dataset><record>
<text>I’ve been coming here for years have given her a lot of service from friends and family but I now I know why I  see how members will yell and disrespect the owner Nancy or the other girls due poor Quality  service and now I know why they don’t appreciate people they that have been giving them service for years today I went to go fix their gel color that was chipping and one of the nails that broke that I just got done a few days ago and she still charge me full price again. I guess I was just comfortable with them, bad place to go! If you go here you will be disappointed in the future they tried to get your business that’s all!<//text><response>None<//response>< name>

Been here a few times to try and not to be judgemental (gym is next door) first time they did a great job . Second not so much  now I’ve just left the place  they messed up my color , all my cuticules and sides were bitten off . They cut me in the cuticle area as soon as I leave the color gets smeared . I come back in not five minutes after I left and they are pushing me to stick my hands into the UV machine to get them dry more times they need to . And main manicurist says “ oh put the other one in (that was dried off completely so no need) don’t want you to come back in “

After about 30 seconds following the comment I stand up and excuse myself saying “ don’t worry I won’t be back to bother you again “

Did not deserve a tip in the first place . TOTALLY DREADFUL<//Text>

<review>Came in here before going to the gym on 4/18/2017 asked for a pedicure since I really needed it. The nail technician was so nice and polite and made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. She showed me her chart prices and I opted for the $25, she told me if I wanted the callous removed then it would be an additional $10.

No complaints here this girl made it worth every single penny, full spa treatment which included soaking your feet in hot wax which was by far the most relaxing experience ever. She set a timer and massaged my feet and legs to perfection which was so nice since I actually dosed off she was honest about completing the entire massage and I woke up the the gentle ring of the timer.

I will definitely be coming here from now on, don't let the lack of decor fool you, these chicks know their stuff!<//review></record>

<Date>1525465398077</Date><text>Zero stars if I could! The guy cut all my fingers so bad to the point where my cuticles where PURPLE, and left me in the gel machine for so long that i got a ring tan! He left me alone for about 25mins and it turns out he left so i had to take out my nails from the gel machine bc it BURNED! I showed my nails to the owner and all she did was massage them (which hurt like hell bc my cuticles were swollen) and take 3 dollars off my total! Not only that but they did not attend my friend because they didnt have time! Yet we had been there for two hours already and they told here they would do them!! I hate the service, and the people here are rude! Dont waste your time here because they wont make any for you!< /text>< gmap_id>

First off, Alyssa knows her stuff!!  Let me get that out of the way!!  This shop is super busy with van and motor home  mods going off the charts!

Down to business.  I ordered a kit for my van in March, was told the wait was substantial.  No prob..  They called when it was available and arranged for pickup and bracket welding..  I made several trips into the office to ask Alyssa questions about stuff and she was extremely helpful..

Understand that this is a small business that's got GLOBAL reach demands.  If you're on any van forums, you know this..

They will take good care of you, and the value of what you get is worth every penny and worth the wait..< /review>

I had the 5 inch lift kit with custom lead springs done on my 2004 Roadtrek 190 Popular earlier this month. In my opinion its worth taking a trip and having Weldtec install the lift kit vs paying shipping and finding a local shop who may or may not do a good job installing it. My van was done in about 26 hours and although its a pricey lift I think it was money well spent. My van drives even better than before the lift, handles rough roads better, doesn't feel top heavy and no more worrying about tearing up my plumbing/fiberglass side skirts. Weldtec also didn't try to nickel and dine me/upcharge me/try to sell me additional things. Highly recommend them and this kit for your Roadtrek/Chevy Express.<//review>

Jeremy made me feel like I was his sole priority during my visit and took time to explain everything in detail.  I got the Ocotillo Cruiser 4 inch lift on my Chateau but now have plans to go with the Baja Grocery Getter 6 inch and go with some 35imch tires.  Jeremy is just a genuine, down to earth guy and I love his YouTube videos.   Great service and solid products.  This shop can do just about anything so expect to see your wish list grow.   From custom bumpers to lift kits to seats and so much more.  👍👍< /review>

Team WeldTec did an awesome job installing the 6” Grocery Getter lift on my 2021 Class C motor home.  With the suspension upgrades, my rig tracks true down the road and eliminated all sway from passing traffic.  I highly recommend upgrading your RV if you looking for more clearance and a more stable ride.<//Text>

<review>Weldtec Designs is the shop for your Van! Jeremy sure knows what he is doing. I grew up in Detroit, Motor City, and have many friends in the biz. I felt very comfortable with his advice, products and service. My 1989 Econoline Falcon drives like a dream with complete suspension upgrade. The rear custom bumper is tops compared to major manufacturers of aftermarket bumpers. I can't go anywhere with out someone drooling over her. On another note, Alyssa was a Rock Star setting me up for the work and scheduling so I can drive the van to and from CO. Thanks again!<//review>< Gmap_id>

Jeremy and Alyssa are a wealth of information and always happy to discuss ride options. Their detailed knowledge and explanations really help guide me through some big decisions, offering excellent short term and long term solutions. The level of details we went into really demonstrated their experience. What can I say... the folks at WeldTec are genuinely stoked to talk shop and stoke others on bringing more adventure to your ride. Thanks again!< /Review>

Outstanding customer service and technical support. I bought a set of a lift kit and shipped them all the way to Dubai, thanks to Alyssa to make it happen and for her excellent customer service. Once I received the items, I faced some technical issues. When I emailed WeldTec Design, it took less than 24hrs to look into the matter, and they will send me a new set of springs free of charge. I was so amazed to receive such type of customer service being miles away. Hats off to Jeremy for his support and his team for such a successful business and being customer-oriented. I highly recommend WeldTec Design.< /review>

<Review>Alyssa, Jeremy and the crew at Weldtec are amazing. They designed and installed a 6” lift for my c-class RV with custom leaf springs and shock valving for the weight of my camper. We live 1500 miles away and always got prompt communication, accurate quotes, and they never missed a deadline.

After 5000 miles of gnarly adventures, one of the components of the lift developed a non-critical potential failure. Weldtec promptly returned my email within hours and had a replacement for both driver and passenger side (despite only the driver side being defective) delivered to my house with days. They even funded 4 hours of labor costs to have the parts installed.

No other company in the off-road market offers the customer service and dedication that Weldtec has.  Hands down, best company out there.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>Called out of the blue today since I can't find anyone who can even start to help me with a rear suspension problem I've been having in my 08 E-250. Jeremy took the time to walk me through all of my options, short term and long term, and he never even pressured me to make a purchase or tried to upsell me on anything.

There really aren't many folks out there willing to just be helpful for the sake of being helpful, but the team at WeldTec is clearly good people. I'll be making the trek from LA County as soon as I can to work with them, and I wouldn't even think about letting anyone else touch my van.</review><user>100468944273183822310<//user><gmapID>0x80d954dad66f1dbd:0xc995b54c3e98e43e<//gmapID><time>1598986875335< /time><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

<review>I worked with Weldtec months in advance to figure out different price options and adds ons that would fit my needs the best. They sent countless quotes for what I wanted done and their hard work and patience during the planning stages was what sold me on their company. I have had the van back for about a month and I couldn’t be more thrilled. The quality of fabrication is amazing and the van rides better than expected. I traveled all the way from Colorado to make this happen and I will be back again for future needs.< /review>< gmap_id>

I had a very interesting and challenging problem. My younger brother is a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corp. He has worked his butt off to protect this country, traveled the world and loves the SoCal lifestyle for surfing and off-roading. His Van was 10 years old and has never been right with respect to Ford ESC and the life of the wheel bearings. He had done some research and found the WeldTec site and all their great work. He wanted to redo his van with their custom radius arms and bent I-Beams.  The issue was he was in Florida for Duty, both his older boys just went into the Corp and he was working 15 hour days for our safety. He reached out  to me and I contacted Jeremy at WeldTec to help make this project work for my brother, his tight schedule and be reliable.  WeldTec went above and beyond. They built up complete I-Beams, loaded them up with Spindles and brakes. Found all the brackets used parts he would need  taht may be missing from teh old conversion. Basically made it an almost bolt on operation.  My brother was able to do the project in a day and a half at the Base hobby shop!! It all worked and fit as designed. Has never felt or driven better!

It was just fantastic service, quality and execution. Would not go anywhere else for custom Van Off-Road equipment and customization. Pretty sure they do more than vans, but they have that dialed in. I was able to pay for it, they direct shipped and I could gift my brother a safe, reliable Van to carry him and his family to the next base or duty. Cheers to WeldTec. GOD bless our men and women in uniform. Thanks again!<//Review>

Update: I am not violating any terms. This was an honest review. Your website is scattered, unorganized and you don't update it. I purchased a vehicle based on parts that you make only to find out after I made the vehicle purchase that you don't make them anymore even though they are listed for sale on your web site.< /Text>

<text>Of the various ways to get a motorhome up out of harms way, Weldtec  I believe has got it figured out. This is the most 'like factory'  lift but better in several ways. The Moog parts they use are better than factory and the ride and handling are superior to the original. The ride is smoother, I believe, due in part to the better shocks (Fox) and the longer trailing arms. The higher height (4" is what I chose ) does not feel more tippy but actually more controlled and quiet. If we ever trade vehicles I will be back to have it lifted-- no more scraping the rear hitch when going into the gas station, store, or driveway. Plus Jeremy and his crew were very gracious and explained everything they would do. Couldn't be more  pleased!
Thank you Jeremy, Alyssa, and the rest for your excellent work.< /text>< user_id>

I purchased a new Coachmen Freelander class-c  RV this year and *really* love the coach.  Perfect floor plan, size and amenities.  The bad news is that I soon found a design flaw.

The sewer black tank outlet and gray tank plumbing was only about 4 inches off the ground.  It scraped even small speed bumps in RV parks, never mind my favorite kind of camping, the boondocks.

I searched for a solution and thankfully found Weldtec Designs.  Check them out on YouTube.

From my first contact with them, having many questions, to having now put about 4,000 miles on the 6-inch kit they installed, my experience has consistently been truly amazing, start to finish.

Not only can I now take my rig nearly ANYWHERE, but surprisingly it also handles much better on the road than it did brand new.  Don’t skimp on the custom leaf springs or the Fox stearing stabilizer.  Wow what a difference.

Bottom line is that the Weldtec lift is worth every penny.  Hands down, and then some.< /review>

So i find WELDTEC online, look at all their videos, ratings, called them couple of times. I drive 450 miles to get a 4" lift installed at their Calif. shop, WOW customer service is off the scale, product is perfect, actually  a little better than that as it looks good.These guys are so soft sell I had a bit of doubt, but the office manager showed me finished Class C's (2) without being to busy, answering my questions, when does this happen anymore, and a prior customer came and picked his class C up with a big smile. It was a 2 day install and they let me sleep in my RV in their parking lot. They are my friends for life,No body does what this company does for product,or service. THANKS WELDTEC !</Text><resp>{'time': 1590595936399, 'text': 'Thanks for the awesome review, John! We work hard to meet expectations like yours, and we’re happy to hear we hit the mark for you.

<Review>Watch Out!$! Negative 10 stars! Jeremy is a complete liar and very fraudulent. He gives vendors like Fox a bad name, he even says Fox service is terrible, even though he sells & installs Fox & the service dept. is half a mile from his shop. My steering stabilizer malfunctioned, sent it back to Weldtec. Jeremy said he took it to Fox, I called Fox & no record for either Jeremy or Weldtec??? After calling, being lied to that Jeremy's out of town, I called from a different phone & Jeremy answered, I thought you were out of town👌He then admitted to taking it to ORW, the lies continued! They had my stabilizer for 45 days, wouldn't send it back until we had several wonderful conversations. He then offered me $40 for the stabilizer that he charged me $300 & it was on my can for a month. Great business plan Liar!! Stay away & report fraudulent shops to the B.A.R.< /Review>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1565136869488, 'text': "Dear Tyson,\nWe're extremely sorry that you had to face such difficulties, problems in customer service is not something we are known for. As you can see from our other reviews, we pride ourselves in providing great customer service and we'd like to do the same for you.\n\nI took it upon myself to look up your latest transaction with us and that was on March, 29, 2018... OVER a year and five months ago. I apologize that it took almost a year and a half to write a review on us.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that it just so happened to be your steering stabilizer that malfunctioned. According to my records and recollection we resolved the issue. However, we NEVER deal with FOX directly. We go through companies like Agile or ORW. The steering stabilizer itself is around $170 but since you purchased the kit that is where the extra $100 comes from. In the end, your steering stabilizer was rebuilt to ensure there was no issues and shipped to you promptly at no charge.\n\nOnce again, we apologize for this inconvenience that you faced as sometimes things are beyond our control. Such as, a malfunctioning steering stabilizer and the companies we use to fix them. We wish we could do everything over here but we cant!\n\nHopefully this message finds you well and you continue to enjoy your Baja Grocery Getter lift kit and steering stabilizer for many more years on your 1999 Ford E-350 7.3L :)\n\nP.S. WE LOVE OUR FOX SHOCKS!!"}< /Resp>< GmapID>

I gave them a call like a month in advance to schedule the install of a complete performance kit in my E350. I stoped by in the morning the day we agreed on and I was blown away by their awesome customer service and approachability. While waiting, we were able to hangout in a room with fast internet and we were even able to shower, it really felt like home. The best part is that I was expecting the job to be completed in 2 days, the first for the install and the next for the alignment. They did it in ONE day which got us some extra travel time :).

So I drove in the morning with a van that was driving really bad, wondering all over the road and came out the same day with a van that drives better than any new truck.. this thing really handles amazing and it get's better the faster you go.

Im totally satisfied by their service and product, I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their suspension, Weldtec design are serious people that get the job done fast and right while making you feel at home, I'll definitely come back for some more upgrades in the future.

PS ->
- The brewery around the block is pretty good, they also have food trucks everyday.
- You can overnight on the street or right out the fence, but since there are several garages around for big trucks and busses it gets pretty loud after 4am.<//text>

Jeremy and his crew are the best! I have a 2001 Ford E350  2 wheel drive and these guys turned into the perfect desert/trail machine. I had the complete 6inch performance package put on and LOVE IT! I would recommend these guys to anyone needing custom modifications.
Thanks Again Jeremy!<//text>

Been working with Jeremy and his team for years on my 2012 Ford E350. Started with a lift, then bumpers, then had them make a new rear bumper with double swing, rock sliders, custom seat mounts. Next up are custom front seats and a roof rack!<//Review>

Weldtec did a good job lifting my year 2000 Chevy Roadtrek class B RV!  Previously the ride was really harsh and the new shocks, rear wheel spacers and leaf springs really made a difference.  The ground clearance was significantly improved for our many dispersed camping/off road adventures.  I was also able to get larger wheels and all terrain tires.  With the higher clearance the van does roll a little more than previously around the turns but the trade off is much improved off-road capability.  Thanks Jeremy and crew!<//text>

< review>
Jeremy and the Weldtec Designs crew do great work.  Jeremy created a custom long travel suspension for my Chevrolet Express van at a time when such a product didn't exist.  This combined with some other work I had done to the van have made it an outstanding all-around vehicle that hauls, camps, and travels just about anywhere I'd want to go.  I recommend their products and would gladly use their services again when the time comes.</review>

<text>Summary:  All positive --- No negatives.  I recently visited Weldtec while out west on a trip from Florida.  During several separate visits Jeremy was excellent at explaining what was available, as well as giving me a tour of his shop.  He was very patient with my endless questions which resulted in a very good feeling about the organization.  The projects that were being worked on in the shop appeared to be very well done and all the staff was very friendly.  As Jeremy says:  "I can build anything."  I came away feeling that was true and that the job would be done well.  I intend to have him upgrade my GMC Savana van soon.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Jeremy and the crew over at Weldtec are jam up. Had lots of questions before I ordered my "Baja Grocery Getter" kit for my E350. Everytime I called Jeremy took the time to answer the questions I had. Once I ordered the kit it was processed quickly! The assembly went great and I had a few questions, called them up and again Jeremy was able to get me pointed in the right direction. Great company and a great product. Will be purchasing more from them in the future.

Thanks Jeremy<//review>

< review>
The folks down at weldtec have got my chevy express sitting right! First off, companies that offer cool things for 96-02 expresses are few and far between. However, when i saw that weldtec had a 2” level spacer at a great price, i had to have it! They were great to work with and made ordering very easy. There was a mix up with shipping and I accidentally got sent a spacer for the newer style van. But not only did they catch it before i started wrenching on the van, but also immediately called to let me know and sent out the right parts. Had em within a few days and fit like a champ! Couldnt have asked for anything more. Customer service is on point and id buy again solely on that aspect, not even mentioning the quality of the product. Im not typically one to write reviews, but i have nothing but great things to say. One thing i also want to mention that i have been extremely happy with is the outcome of my van once i installed their product. At first i wanted more lift but that spacer is all money could allow for at the moment. But those 2” did miracles to an ol work van. If i had it done over id buy it again in a hurry. My only regret is not buying sooner. Do yourself and your van a favor and buy from weldtec!<//review>

<Review>Unbelievable wealth of knowledge and passion for what they do! The "can do" attitude of Weldtech is so refreshing! I have had a huge wish-list, and for years, I have only heard no. Jeremy may be the only one in the industry that is inline with what I am looking for. And I am obviously not alone! I was able to take a ride in their latest SEMA build, and once the word gets out on that magic, they will need to get an even bigger shop!! I have had several 4x4 Vans and dumped tons of money into their suspension. Never have I achieved a ride I found satisfactory. I just assumed I was doomed to have a terrible ride if I wanted the rest of the benefits of a van. Well, my mind has been blown, and I will be selling all of my toys to afford this new build!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Drink were made super fast and the staff in the back were super nice but the lady at the register didn't want to give me info on cup sizes or flavors of sweeteners. I never felt like I was bothering someone at a Starbucks. Every Starbucks I have been to gives me more info then I even ask for.
Would be 5 stars without that register lady.</text>

It's a Starbucks. I order via mobile phone, walk in and out. Everyone was friendly and where to pick up my drink was clearly identified,  which is not always the case.</review>

If the white lady is making your drink watch her. I request no water in my drink and I watched her put water in it. And when u asked if she put water in it she couldn't look me in the face as she lied through her teeth.</text>

<text>While the customer service was phenomenal, the food was in poor taste. Crepes, sausage, and eggs were cold and along with taste in food was not as good.

The only tasty part of the meal was the Candied Bacon Pancakes, sweet and delicious. The hash browns were able very scrumptious and crunchy.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We retirned the next day and found Gaby to be equally attentive and again the food was great. Happy to be able to dine in even if it was out doors.<//text>< user_id>

< Review>
This is a standard chain restaurant. Grandma loves it here. We had a party of six and were seated quickly. We ordered 4 coffee's but there are free refills. We ordered a Brioche Foster combo, a Rise and Shine Breakfast, Blueberry pancakes, 2 orders of hashbrowns, Big Steak, a Split Decision  and another side of something. Breakfast is consistent here. It was good and served warm. Server was good.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Me and my husband called for a pick up order. I ordered Spicy Shedded Beef “BOWL” but I got a burrito and whoever got our food said I’m sorry we made a burrito if you want we can make it but it will take like 20mins or so..like what? Why did you not tell the kitchen to remake it before we get there? We went there like 40 mins after we place the order. And my husband ordered a breakfast sandwich with no Swiss cheese but they have a Swiss cheese in it. So I guess the guy should pay attention to details of our order coz I know it’s not the kitchens fault it’s him. The guy should be train better.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I’ve ordered from here twice. Both times they messed up my wife’s order where they forgot her pancakes and this latest time they charged us for specialty pancakes but gave us regular ones. This was after telling us it would be ready after 30 minutes, in which we waited another 20 minutes once arriving on time. The management is spreading their employees too thin. The waitress at the cashier had a lot of customers and was doing 3 different jobs by herself. Never coming back here again.</Review><userid>103412646771498142083< /userid><gmapID>0x80dc75ac04e264b3:0x81896fb724519d61< /gmapID>< Name>

Going at night you might have to stand around a bit for one of the employees to come out.  There is only a couple working and if they are in the back grabbing something you might be standing around.  Dont worry though they were really friendly and super helpful.  The food was tasty and who doesn't love bottomless pancakes.  Their eggs and hashbrowns are pretty good to.  Restrooms were clean last time I went in.< /text>

I ordered ihop online they use door dash as their delivery service when the driver pulled up it was a dirty old car. When he got out he didn’t have a mask or gloves on. His has were dirty with long nails and dirt under. I did not feel comfortable eating my food at all. The manger jack not the best person to voice your concerns too couldn’t find my online order when I called. Didn’t apologize about the situation immediately blamed doordash. This morning he called me telling me he refunded me and not to call again! Wow great worst service ever!

Update Jack manger called me back two days later and stated they refunded me and to never call back again wth kind of manger is he. Should be nice so I can go back?? Did he go to College of customer service for clowns???

Anyway never got a refund but why bother with such a nasty manger keep the money obviously you need it since your horrible customer service keep everyone away!!!< /text>

Very slow location...at least in the evenings. The food is good, nothing special, and the dining room is clean. Everytime we have been it has been slow. We get sat right away, the area is quiet, and the food is what we expect. The employees are always friendly and happy to grab anything you.< /review>

<Text>I never go to IHOP, this was my first experience in a very long time. Overall I would say it was good. I only got pancakes and hashbrowns, which came out to around $13, which is ridiculously expensive if you ask me. But oh well. The food was good, table was clean, staff was nice, what more do you need. I'll probably end up going again.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dc75ac04e264b3:0x81896fb724519d61< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

worse experience ever! Walked in, they sat us down and that was it. We waited for about 20 minutes, they never offered us anything to drink none the less food. They were just walking by our table and never even acknowledged us. We walked away and they didn't even realize that! We came to San Marcos IHOP and right away almost they offered us drink and took our order! Very happy with ihop in San marcos service!<//Review>

The waiter was really attentive to my family and I. I ordered french toast and it was really good. Wish there was an option to get   a smaller portion like two slices instead of three. Still very tasty though! Thank you!<//review>

<review>We stopped here around midnight on our way to Sam Diego, CA. Our waiter was very friendly and welcoming, there was only other couple in the place and our family, they took kind of long to bring our food out but, the customer service that we received over powered the fact that we waited too long. Our waitress noticed that we were tired and just annoyed and she went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. She even offered us coffee to go for the road. But, we were gonna stop at a hotel for the night. I appreciated the customer service we received.<//review><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

The IHOP in Vista is my father's favorite breakfast spot. The coffee is always hot and the service is fast and efficient. Seems to be always busy but you always able to get a seat quick. The Turkey dinner was good, but they give you a Logenberry sauce that is extremely sweet. The Turkey sandwich was really good there was plenty of it! Maybe a little less turkey and another piece of bacon would be good. Everything was nice and hot and the service was very good.</Review>

I'm surprised every time I try something new. I've gobbled a gazillion pancakes and waffles through the years. But Burgers? Killer burgers? BBQ? Chicken strips? We had all of these the last time we visited. I cannot believe the high quality of each one of the aforementioned items. I ate so fast I forgot to take pics. You will too. ❤️< /review>

Great service. Friendly cashier. Food was very good. We had a very clean table. Kid friendly. Prices are mostly affordable. Dinner prices on some items are a little high. For a family dinner. Breakfast is my favorite. Waitress was fast loved children in my opinion. We don't have any. But that day at least half of her tables had one or more. Very patience and had a 😄.</review>

Food was great. The service; on the other hand, was not good. Upon entering I was not informed that only one cook was in service ( The waitress informed me about the cook after taking my order) therefore, I had to wait more than the normal waiting time. It would be very opportune if the customer is informed when entering, so that way the customer has the opportunity to decide to rather wait or not.<//Text>

It's the first hang out place my husband and I would visit when we were just friends. Your restaurant does not have a welcoming homey feeling to it anymore. The new look, makes you feel like you are in a business office, uninviting. It was not busy and our waitress brought out drinks, said she would come back and never did. They didn't inform us if she was going on break or if we were getting a new server. After receiving a new server, he explained it's because she was busy and he would be taking over. (There were only two other guests there). Your new menu is so corporate, there are no more kids menus. It's now one small section in the back of the regular menu. Your prices are high and your portions are smaller. I got a split decision with two tiny pancakes. They were kid size pancakes. My husband and I were upset with our hashbrowns. There were hardly any, put together it would be one order. Our bacon was cold. My sons macaroni and cheese was watery. It seemed like the food was sitting there before the manager brought our food out. The wait was long, food was cold, and the atmosphere was unwelcoming. Three different people to wait one table in almost empty restaurant. I have to say after visiting this location for 8 years we will no longer be coming back. We are now only Denny's patrons. Their prices are almost the same but their food is not cold and the portions are double.<//Review>< Name>

This IHOP was a mixed bag, mostly good but places where there could be improvements. The food portions were very sizeable (i ordered the Cowboy burger), however the service staff seemed a bit inattentive, despite having almost no other party to wait on during my time spent there eating.<//text>

<text>Began visiting @ IHOP regularly after my first time there being pleasantly comforting.  With each visit come new pleasantries.   Definitely suggest going to IHOP if you're into a earthy, small home town feel, and great hospitality with a side of warmth in their smiles.
Oh yeah, the food is great as well...lol<//text>< pics>

I'm visiting with my family on Mother's Day. Even as busy as it is, it was still a short wait. The noise level isn't overwhelming, and all of the servers are very pleasant. The food was predictable, which means it was good. I'm not in this area very often, but I would come back.< /Text>

Araceli was very attentive and gave excellent customer service! I had ordered a vanilla iced coffee and she didn't even ask if I wanted another one. As soon as she saw that I was just below half she brought another out! It was great! Very friendly! She made sure we had all we needed and asked if our food was good. Thank you Araceli for the amazing service!</text>

<text>It was "alright" but overpriced. $60 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Bacon and scrambled eggs where flavorless, hashbrowns had no flavor, hot chocolate was in a tiny mug and our raspberry tea with free refills are mostly ice and finish in 4 gulps and take a while to get refilled. Atleast I didn't have to cook breakfast this time ...</text>< Pics>

This place did not have a changing station in either the Male bathroom or the female bathroom. It was a huge inconvenience. I'll never come back here again. If you have small babies, dont waste your time coming here.<//Text>

We were first in line to pay for our food and the cashier made told us to circle what was going to be taken  off the ticket even though we had already verbally told her it was the one meal. She made us wait since we wanted to split the ticket and started checking other people out who was behind us.

Our food was delicious and the service was great! I didn't give it 5 stars because the portions seemed smaller than before. My parents got the breakfast sampler and i got some diet breakfast meal. My parents ate their entire meal and my dad even ate some of my toast! We enjoyed it so much though, we will be back.</review>

<text>Food was okay but not the best,  2 of us ordered a wrap and there was more lettuce on it than turkey and avocado very disappointing.  Our waitress disappeared and we couldn't get refills on drinks or even get our check. Had to find someone to help us which want easy. The sad thing is that there were only about 10 people in  there and nobody to working. Sad< /text>< Pics>

Great staff & service overall but was overpriced and food was not so great. (Had the Spicy Chicken Ranch Sandwich & my husband had the Steak Omelette-not enough steak so they stuffed it with more hashbrown &eggs)</Text>

<Name>Peter Guidera</Name><review>This place used to be one of my late night “go-to’s”. But ever since they stopped being a 24-hour restaurant a few months ago, it’s gone downhill. Service is really slow both when they seat you and when they serve you at your table, and the staff seems like they just aren’t interested in doing their jobs. Tonight I showed up at about 10:15pm—45 minutes before they close—and waited for about 5-10 minutes with four other people at the front. When the hostess/waitress finally came over to us, she said that they were only doing “to go” orders. Never in all of my IHOP experiences have I ever been told something like that. I suppose that would be reasonable if I showed up 10 minutes before they closed, but not in this case. All four of us turned around and left. Do your job.<//review>< resp>

I usually don't comment for these, but this place is exceptional!  Everything you look for in a mid-price dining experience: quick, courteous, and delicious. I drive past my closest IHOP (and many other restaurants) to go to this one in particular. They're the reason I'm always up to go if someone suggests IHOP for breakfast (or dinner)!<//text>

<Text>Great ihop!! Has amazing service and I always feel wanted there. The only issue I have I guess 😂😂 is that they dont have many options for the kids eat free menu. Other than that this IHOP is a good one.<//Text><time>1474440982955< /time>< resp>

I went to IHOP with my kids we are regular customers and we got there every two weeks and my son ordered a T-bone and what I got was a uncooked, horrible tasting, and horrible looking meat my son told me and I informed the waitress, she told me do you want a box to take it home or do you wants us to cook it more and I said no I don't like the look of the steak and she left and didn't even say sorry. I'm not upset about the whole amount I payed  for everything, I'm upset of the T-bone's condition.<//text>

This place used to be one of my late night “go-to’s”. But ever since they stopped being a 24-hour restaurant a few months ago, it’s gone downhill. Service is really slow both when they seat you and when they serve you at your table, and the staff seems like they just aren’t interested in doing their jobs. Tonight I showed up at about 10:15pm—45 minutes before they close—and waited for about 5-10 minutes with four other people at the front. When the hostess/waitress finally came over to us, she said that they were only doing “to go” orders. Never in all of my IHOP experiences have I ever been told something like that. I suppose that would be reasonable if I showed up 10 minutes before they closed, but not in this case. All four of us turned around and left. Do your job.</review>

< Review>
It’s close to my other job, it’s open 24 hours and it’s near some friends houses, so yeah when we ride out late this is often our go to spot for latenight eats. It’s a welcome change of pace form the fast food and Mexican readily available everywhere else. It’s much better than any Denny’s around and they recently remodeled the entire place.

The latenight staff is much more friendly than other places, not even because we are semi regulars here. The key is order some food for here and order food for breakfast tomorrow so you’re not as hungover.

My go to’s are French Toast (kings Hawaiian if they have it, dulche de leche if they have it). Combo for the eggs (overeasy), sausage and bacon. Coffee or iced tea, water. The French toast is always consistent, eggs are never overcooked (unless you go scrambled). Sausage is on the blander side and the bacon I like crispy. We split a sampler for the sauces and fried food similar to a fast food place. We recently tried their new burgers, you know, since they are now ihoB.

The Mega is big, but not huge. Double meat, 2 cheeses, go easy on the onions since they are red. The quality of the bun, burger, build are good, way better than Dennys (you never go to Denny’s, you just end up there….because your night has gone to hell). We also split the Big Brunch which has hash browns (be sure to ask for extra extra crispy) and the egg is perfectly soft and runny.

With the recent renovations, friendly staff, reasonable prices, late hours and consistent food, decent burgers, it’s a solid go to place for latenight eats. It’s not islands, but better than a lot of places for the burgers alone. I’m not sold on the change in the business focus, but they certainly did not abandon the breakfast items.

Watch out for the drunks, I’ve seen some things go down here, but I guess not everyone can handle their business.</Review>

<text>We came as a part of a very large party. They could not seat us all at one table because of our size So we sat separately which was fine. During that time a waitress came and knew we were apart of that party. She took the other tables order and left. It was quite busy. She did not let us know that she would return. She was gone long enough that our table of three was able to make up our minds what we would like to order. We never received any refills on our existing drinks. Our waitress was not so bad, but the staff was very impolite. At one point my daughter was on her way to the bathroom and accidentally bumped into a staff member. She apologized and the staff member told her "she needed to learn how to walk right." As we were talking, two other staff members were pushing through my fathers seat to try and move a table and chair to the other side of the restaurant and didn't announce their presence until they were pinching their way through and bumping into him. While we paid our bill the cashier Vanessa asked us how we enjoyed our experience. My spouse said we didn't have very good service here overall and she replied "Why Thank you" in a snooty tone and as we left we were in shock at the attitude and Vanessa said "You're welcome" Then she shook her head and rolled her eyes as we left. The manager was greeting people at the opposite door and at no point did she say "I am sorry to hear that" or "here is our manager". Instead she decided to become offended and talk in a very rude tone and this was not customer service or the attitude of someone who should be in customer service. I own my own business and take pride in treating my paying customers with respect and these experiences in no way reflected an enjoyable experience for my children nor my spouse and I.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc75ac04e264b3:0x81896fb724519d61<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm noticing the reviews & I go weekly so if you have a problem with anything he will correct it. He always takes a minute to see if everything is ok say hello & thank you & ask you to come back. His staff is great also. I pass up another ihop & go extra miles to come to this one because they're consistent & if anything is wrong Miguel will make it right. My absolute favorite place to dine.< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>This is Nothing like the original International House of Pancakes. Two bucks for a Senior cup o'coffee! I (thought) I'd be getting Two eggs with my order, (wrong). The butter was hard,,, I look at the "cute" ads, & the main thing I see is Sugar, sugar, sugar for the kids.

My breakfast was cold. I was hungry, & I don't believe in wasting food. I needed use of WiFi, & this iHop has none. I'll be notifying friends on FB. Disappointed customer.

<review>(Translated by Google) This restaurant already recommends it because the pancakes are all raw, poor service, the servers do not serve you well and there is no manager to attend to the problem.

(Translated by Google) Very badly I ordered a meal they gave me raw, it is so that they give good service just as the times are and grabbing things as with their feet, less they will sell😏

Muy mal ordene una comida mela dieron cruda,  es para que den buen servicio así como estan los tiempos y asiendo las cosas como con los pies menos van a vender😏</Text>

(Translated by Google) I was waiting for 40 minutes and only the waitresses passed by and they did not attend to me. My money is not worth to attend to me.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I liked the food a lot but there are some details that need improvement, first detail we arrived first that some customers and the clients that arrived after they received their food first, second detail after serving the food did not come back to ask if we needed anything else, third detail such It was a careless time or so in this restaurant But there were no extra napkins, fourth and last detail I am Latin and for the same reason we sometimes get bad treatment because most do not give tips so when we see that we are Latinos they automatically think that we are not going to tip and the treatment is different than that of other customers

(Original)
Me gustó mucho la comida pero hay algunos detalles que necesitan mejorar , primer detalle llegamos primero que unos clientes y los clientes que llegaron después recibieron primero su comida,segundo detalle después de servirnos la comida no regresaron a preguntar si necesitábamos algo más,tercer detalle tal vez fue un descuido o así es en este restaurante Pero no habían servilletas extras, cuarto y último detalle soy latino y por el mismo motivo a veces recibimos mal trato porque la mayoría no dan propina así que al vernos que somos latinos automáticamente piensan que no vamos a dar propina y el trato es diferente que el de otros clientes< /Review>
