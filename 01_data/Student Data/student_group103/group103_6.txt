Belal Hamideh Law has a wonderful staff who is always available for any questions. They were also available whenever we had any concerns or questions about our case. They sat down with us for over an hour and really helped walk us through the entire settlement process and what we should expect. I am very glad that I worked with that firm and will definitely refer them to other people.<//Text>

I worked with Belal Hamideh and he was amazing. He was always helpful, responded to every email the same or the next day. He kept me updated throughout the entire process. I would recommend this firm to anyone that is having difficulty with the insurance companies paying any settlement. They have truly amazing customer service.<//Text>

<text>Great lawyer, made everything very easy and understanding. I found out about Belal through my mom.  He helped her in an accident case also.  He spoke to me himself when the accident happened and took good care of my case.  He sent me to a good doctor that helped me feel better.  Then he negotiated my settlement himself.  He has assistants that help him on the case and they always answer my calls.   Great result and customer service.< /text>< userid>

<review>I had a car accident on 1/29/21 called Belal and spoke to him personally the same day. He talked me through the details of how a PI case works and I signed our contract. He immediately called a doctor and got me in the next business day to get my neck and back looked at . Belal seemed to be very prompt and caring about my injuries which made me feel very positive I had made the right choice for him to represent me. So far I had had a very pleasant experience with all the physicians his paralegal Mattalyn has chosen for me. I've had MRI's and Chiropractic care. I will keep updating as my case progresses.<//review><resp>{'time': 1615409972865, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the positive feedback!

I was referred by a friend to see Belal after a car accident. When I called, the response was immediate and throughout the claim I was always provided with updates. I felt overwhelmed at first because it was right as quarantine started, but Belal and his team made it easy! It has been such a smooth and easy experience. I only had to speak with insurance company once to start the claim and then they took over. I am thankful that I found a great attorney to help me with my claim. I would definitely recommend Belal!< /Review>

Belal Hamideh is an excellent attorney. I retained his services last year following an automobile accident in which I was the victim.The meeting with him was very brief yet very detailed and to the point. Mr. Hamideh was excellent in communicating with me via email and phone regarding my case. I was able to receive a favorable decision and I am sure it was due to Mr. Hamideh's efforts. I highly recommend Mr. Hamideh & his firm for your legal needs.< /Review>

It took me a while to compile this, because there are so many great words that I have about him. Belal took my case after another attorney, that totally screwed it up and was verbally demeaning. Belal promised to get me justice and he DID! My case was very hard and the company was denying their liability, making me a perpetrator instead of the victim of an assault by a coworker. Belal even settled a civil case in addition to the Worker's Compensation case. He is absolutely amazing. God Bless Him! He will fight for you and will treat you with respect and compassion. It's no wonder that he is considered a young STAR Attorney. Very Professional and Knowledgeable, as well as great hearted personality. All of these qualities in one person is such a rare case in our world. I believe that Belal Hamideh is one of the best attorneys, and I'm fortunate to have found him. My wife and I wish him all the best! A++++++++++++++< /Text>

<name>Sean Callahan</name><Review>Belal Hamideh Personal Injury Attorney:

We had originally retained Belal for my wife's case which is complicated, but understandingly still ongoing. Among all of the lawyers we consulted with he was the only one who explained how everything works.

When I was injured my wife knew immediately to contact Belal. Soon after he got me to the correct doctors and made sure I was provided transportation to my appointments. He was very thorough and in constant contact with me on the progress and materials needed for my case. He was also honestly concerned with how I was progressing physically and how I was feeling mentally (he asked every time we talked and still does). If I had any questions or needs he would frequently return my calls himself or if he couldn't my case manager would get back to me that day or the next. He made sure I was compensated for missed work as well as my current and future medical expenses. My case was resolved in less than a year and the result exceeded my expectations. Belal truly goes above and beyond for his clients. Thank you for answering our prayers.

Sincerely,
Sean C.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1589914519037, 'text': "Sean, it was our pleasure assisting you with your wife's case!"}< /resp>< Rate>

The Belal Hamideh Law Firm helped me through a difficult time for not one but two auto accidents. They kept me informed and guided me through each process which enabled me to focus on my recovery.  When neither insurance company would make a fair offer, Belal Hamideh immediately went after them and filed suit.  When my case was settled, Mr. Hamideh went the extra step and negotiated down my medical bills so I could put more money in my pocket. I highly recommend their services.< /Review>

If you have a worker’s compensation claim and need help, look no further! Mr Hamideh is the attorney for the job! Coming into my claim I had no idea that I would even need an attorney. When I hired Mr Hamideh, he took care of every aspect of my case. He made sure I under stood what was going on and how he planned to respond. I never had to worry about anything besides getting treatment and getting well. He was able to resolve my claim with a desirable amount. He fought for me in my claim and was able to get me the finances needed for my care. He is a man of his word, he is very polite and courteous. He assured me from the beginning he would fight hard for me, and he did simple as that!!! He even checked in often to see how treatment was going and I appreciated that considering my employer never even seemed to be empathetic about my injury. I highly recommend him. Kudos to Mr Belal Hamideh for an outstanding job handing my case.< /Review>

<Text>I was rear ended in February of last year and was in very strong pain in my neck and shoulder. My car was stopped at the traffic light and the other car crashed into me. I reached out to BelalHamidehLaw to seek assistance on getting the insurance process started. They immediately scheduled me for a medical exam near me at a time that worked for me and then handled everything from there onwards. They were sending me updates regularly on the case. When I told them I did not feel the chiro assigned to my case was helping me, they automatically changed me to another doctor who was much more helpful. Belal and his team were able to recover from the insurance all medical fees plus additional personal injury compensation. Julia was the one assigned to my case and she took the time to explain to me everything through the process and answer all my questions. Highly recommend this firm if you need a lawyer for an injury case.</Text>< Pics>

When the insurance company was pushing me around, and not giving me clear answers to my questions, I decided to call Belal Hamideh, we spoke on the phone about my case and he gave me multiple scenarios on what to expect of him as well the case. He also told me not to worry about anything that he would make sure that I win with the best outcome possible. He told he would get the most trust worthy and professional doctors we could get on my case. Not only did he keep his word but he made sure to regularly keep me in the loop, by personally calling to let me know how a court case went. If youre currently reading this review and youre not sure if you want to give him a call, just the fact that you're reading this proves youre interested and I can definitely/personally say, that 5 star review isn't for show. Its a fact.< /Text>

Attorney Belal is very professional and friendly. He help me with my personal injury case and got me a 90% recovery for my settlement.  I'm very pleased and would definitely recommend him to all my friends and family if they were to ever need his service.  He's  also handling my Worker's  Compensation case and I have no doubts that he will lead us to success. Thanks attorney Belal I appreciate all your help.< /Review>

I Found Atty Belal Hamideh on google based on searching for a workers compensation Attorney... I called him at 11pm Friday evening because on google it shows open 24hrs; At 8am Saturday (next day) I spoke with the actual Attorney himself!  He is very Nice and provided a free consultation. He also listened to every question I had, unlike other attorneys I contacted they immediately want you to retain them. Atty Belal  provided & explained the process of  workers comp! Very thankful for the knowledge he shared because this is all new to me! Most definitely will refer and RECOMMEND him to people in need of an attorney!!!!<//Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>I had a work situation not that long ago where I was discriminated against at my place of work. It was a very stressful time being that I was also a female dealing with a very toxic male environment. After doing some thorough research, I came across Belal's firm where I was able to seek tangible advice that helped me tremendously. It's very nerve wrecking when you're unsure what to do in this type of a situation and I felt very limited however, they reassured me and helped me through the process allowing me some sense of relief. Not only are he and his team extremely insightful they have this type of confidence through their work and due diligence that makes you feel as if you're in the right place. I HIGHLY recommend him and his team because there is truly nothing better than feelingas if you're in the right hands!<//text>< rating>

Belal Hamideh was very knowledgeable and explained everything very well throughout the whole process. He was very efficient and got back to us in a very reasonable amount of time. When talking with him you can tell he really cares about his clients and takes the time to do things properly. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great injury lawyer.<//review>

<Text>Mr. Belal worked on my case for more than three years. Dispute the effort he put into my complicated case he still charged me less than any other attorney will charge. I always felt that my case is in good hands and never worried about the conclusion, as I know how much he works and care to settle my case with the maximum amount. He always kept me posted with any updates on my case and the most awesome thing that I was able to text him and him anything directly without having to go through his staff. I highly recommend him and will recommend to all my beloved one if they needed an attorney.<//Text><rate>5</rate>< user_id>

<review>Thank you Belal Hamideh and firm in regards to my workers comp case. I'm very pleased with the outcome. The attorney was able to reach a settlement with my previous employer promptly and able to help me receive medical treatment after my previous employer declined to pay for my doctors visit. The firm is very knowledgeable and would respond to my emails and calls same day as well as remind me to show up to my court hearings. I definitely recommend the firm.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I never thought I would be in a situation where I had to contact a lawyer. However that quickly changed this past summer. I was very scared and confused on what to do or who to trust. That wasn't the case with Belal Hamideh. I felt to comfortable with my decision in choosing them. They made me feel like family and were there every step on the way. I highly recommend them to friends and family. They were the best decision!<//Review>

I have nothing but great feedback for Mr. Hamideh, I was referred by a close friend and I was guaranteed amazing service. I was very pleased with this lawyer as well as his friendly and professional staff. They went above and beyond to help me understand my case and kept  me informed throughout the entire process. He kept me informed of the status of my case. His paralegal Maricela was such a great help they were both always in communications with me. Mr. Hamideh made this a very easy process for me. I would deininty be using Hamideh law in the near future and I highly recommend his services to anyone seeking legal help. He is an exceptional lawyer.</Text>

Mr. Belal Hamideh is a legit lawyer. I was involved in a car accident while in a taxi cab an he settled my case in less than a year. All my medical bill paid with compensation for myself. He also gave me a discount. I will refer him to anyone involved in a car accident and continue using his services for myself. Received my settlement today. Thank you Belal Law!<//review>

Unfortunately, last year, I was rear ended and my car was totaled. Snake Attorney’s come a dime a dozen which is why I feel they solicit so many clients through commercial ads and billboards.. In order to avoid that, when I needed representation, my Doctor referred me to a Law office he felt would do me a great service. However, I received everything but great or mediocre service and have therefore, had one of the worst experiences with an attorney this past year. I noticed Belal Hamideh in the building we both work, as I heard him speak casually to people and I could tell that he was an Attorney.  Since I was going through the stressful experience with my current attorney,  I verified his profession with the receptionist in hopes that I could receive a consultation. At that time, I wanted to switch attorneys; however, Belal explained to me that it was too late for me to switch Attorneys (so much time had passed, almost a year with current attorney). Without question, Belal provided me with advice free of charge, he treated me like a client (I wasn’t even his client), more so than my own Attorney. Because of this, I can honestly say his service is quality over quantity. Belal was genuine, respectful and an expert in his skill. When I was stuck in a rut with my dreadful Attorney, Belal helped me get through. I spoke to him a couple of times after our initial greeting and he advised me on how to close my case and deal with my Attorney who wouldn’t even answer my calls and only “preferred me to email.” Consequently, I won’t tell you who not to go to with my negative experience with the unprofessional attorney, but I can with confidence advise you to seek Belal Hamideh Law. Thanks Belal!< /Text>

<text>On September 20th around 12:00 pm midnight I got in a very bad accident,it was a hit and flee.  The other guy ran a  red light and caused us to tbone him.  My sister got out the car because my seat belt got locked and noticed the other guy was drinking and driving.   He hit another car also and they started chasing him. There was police and ambulance that came and I had bruises.   I found Belal Hamideh on Yelp and he agreed to take my office even though it happened last year.   He is going to help me with medical treatment next to my work.   I thank Belal  for agreeing to take my case when other lawyers didn't want to help.<//text>< pics>

Belal provides grade A service.  I called Belal about a car accident, he was able to provide info over the phone.  The process was fairly easy, he took over all communication with the insurance company, was able to cover my medical bills, repairs, and lost wages.  If I ever have an issue I will reach out to him.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I chose to take couple of minutes and compose an audit about "Belal Hamideh Law" firm. I do read on different audits. A companion of mine let me know about Belal Hamideh and in the wake of going by such a variety of law offices in LA, I chose to try it out. Belal Hamideh was so decent and exceptionally proficient. He helped me with my pile up. The greater part of the individuals that I know let me know that it was my deficiency on the grounds that I was making a left turn on a yellow (turning red) flag light on Beverly Blvd and Vermont Ave. That 99% flaw is the individual who makes the left turn. Well prepare to be blown away. that is not genuine. Belal Hamideh helped me. I am so glad. I kept their data and I as of now offered it to my loved ones. I recently suspected that it will be beneficial for you to try it out.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1564686406780, 'text': "It was great working with you, Edwin!

Mr hamideh is an excellent lawyer.  He does what he says he is going to do.   I used to have a lawyer before him that didn't help me.   I switched to him and it was a great decision.   He won my case at trial and I recommend him to everyone.</Review>

We came to Mr. Hamideh and his law firm with a very challenging case concerning my daughter's serious injuries. He was aggressive, knowledgeable, and involved with me and my family through the whole process. And he got us a great recovery! I would highly recommend him on any cases involving injuries to their children or themselves.Thumbs up for this law firm!!<//Review>

I sincerely recommend the lawyer Belal Hamideh, he has just solved a car accident case which does not raise any power to recover anything from that case. But lawyer Belal could do it and I recovered the maximum in that case. Personally I recommend it and has a very professional and friendly staff<//text>

I was injured in a severe car accident. I hired Belal Hamideh Law and after an initial consultation, Mr. Hamideh took my case. While being caring and compassionate with me he fought real hard for me and he got me a great settlement in my favor for my injuries.His staff members were very courteous and professional. ...he is also medically very knowledgeable with all types of injuries. .. I highly recommend him as your personal injury lawyer.<//Text>

I absolutely recommend this personal injury attorney! Just about a year ago I was driving when a huge truck ran through a red light and totalled my car. The other driver lied and actually tried to say I T-boned him. I was in pain, completely stressed out and worried beyond belief. I walked into Mr. Hamideh's office and they immediately calmed me and made sure I was well taken care of. Because of him, the other drivers' insurance company took responsibility and Belal Hamideh won a substantial recovery for me. I was very pleased and would use him for any future claims! 😆😆😆</text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>My friend Ricardo has an accident at his workplace and suffered a terrible injury on his shoulder. Aside of that, his now former employees were very abusive with him and thought they would got away with everything just because Ricardo doesn’t speak English well and because of his legal status. After looking for lawyers in LA and finding nothing but opportunists and scammers we came across Belal and his team. Ricardo was able to explain everything himself in Spanish and was supported since day one. Several months later he got his full compensation. What I want to highlight (and what motivated this review) was Belal’s level of commitment with my friend’s case. He knew that not only law was infringed but that an injustice was done to Ricardo, and unlike most of the lawyers he was more interested in making justice than in his paycheck...< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Absolutely do not recommend if you want your furniture in one piece. They broke 4 pieces of furniture (nightstand, desk, shoe cabinet, book case), despite a decent amount they charged for every little item (~$4200 for one bedroom apt) and a generous tip. We haven’t unpacked our boxes yet so we don’t even know yet if there is damage to other items. They didn’t reattach the handles to the dresser. Not only that, they told us we had to pay their parking ticket. Very disappointed with the service and recommended to a friend moving from CA to NY not to use this service.</Review>

<text>If you value your belongings, avoid CA-NY Express at all costs. Several of our chairs were heavily scratched and broken during our move (chairs that their crew had wrapped), porcelain was scattered (packed carefully and in heavy-duty plastic boxes). The moving crew was clearly rough on our moving goods, which we saw firsthand as they unloaded our belongings in California.

CA-NY Express do their very best to discourage you from filing an insurance claim. For example, insurance claims are only accepted by registered mail and with a notary. They also ask you to send photos, which is fair and normal. What is not fair or normal is that they several times claimed that they did not receive the photos even though I sent them over and over again (using Gmail). Tamir, at the claims department, kept stalling the process (for months) and even stopped replying to my emails at one point.

Several months and many, many emails after I filed the claim, they finally responded. But only to offer us a measly $46 (the damages amounted to over $1,750). Knowing that they would never reimburse us for the broken porcelain, we had only claimed the chairs (as mentioned, they had wrapped and packaged the chairs themselves).

CA-NY Express cares as little about your belongings as they do about customer care. Don’t be fooled like us and hire someone else.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

I could not be happier with the service. I was lucky a friend who moved from NYC to LA recommended this company to me. From the first email, the entire team was very responsive, clear and professional.

On moving day, the team was excellent. Corteous, on time and very mindful. They packed items that needed extra safety and made the whole process very smooth.

Communication re: delivery was frequent and timely and the delivery was arranged easily and went through very well.

I guess my most valuable piece of feedback is: at least in NYC, moving companies have a terrible reputation, always trying to swindle you by being overly strict/opaque re: inventory changes etc. This company was the exact opposite. I trusted them every step of the way and I am glad to report all my stuff is intact now that the move is complete. Highly recommended!</Review>

These guys made moving cross country completely painless. We had an awesome team in NYC who safely and effectively broke down our furniture and wrapped it. The foreman worked hard to minimize extra costs. They have a great labeling system that ensured that we got everything that went on the truck at the end of the move. The CA team was efficient and very fast. Our belongings made it cross country in under a week. I'd definitely use them again!< /Review>

<Review>We wanted to move with a storage service that already has all of my boxes wrapped and ready to drop off with a moving service.

CA-NY Express refused to work with me to adjust their rate in any way to reflect that they were not moving me out of my apartment.   They were very standoffish.   Bob who runs their quoting department was completely inflexible and one of those "we only do it this way guys", telling me that they would have to charge me for the crew even though there was no crew moving us out.

If you have any complexity at all don't work with these guys, they'll try to push you into their standard operation and "volume fees" which have their various costs baked in. Bad experience.< /Review><user_name>Nick Michlewicz</user_name></record></dataset><record>
<rating>1</rating><Review>this was the WORST moving experience I have ever had. All my boxes showed up broken and beaten. There was a thick goo that leaked into my boxes and ruined a lot of my personal belongings.

The worst part is my brand new 60" flat screen showed up and was broken. Despite them wrapping it in a moving blanket the TV showed up with scuff marks that look like someone was just kicking the tv. I turned it on the screen was completely broken.

When trying to call them to rectify this situation they give me the run around and have stopped responding to requests.

their website says they have an A+ rating on Better Business Bureau but when I contacted them to file a complaint they have never heard of this business.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY</Review>< date>

<review>1) I was given a false quote (even though I asked if I could send pictures to help with the quote)
2) The move cost much more than the quote (quote was $2000 actual was 4500)(I was never told a ball park of how much more the move would be or what I could do to make the move less expensive)
3) The movers left an object and then were late to pick it up which greatly inconvenienced my friend who was doing me a huge favor.
4) the day of my move - the most important time to talk to someone-  everyone was MIA
5) In general no one has reached out to me or been proactive about resolving things
5) My things left a full week after they were supposed to missing at least 3 trucks they could have been on
6)  I never received an apology or even just an acknowledgment of what happened
7) they lost a bench and eventualy returned it 2 months late
8) they offered 150 off the move - in general the worst customer service i have received. david is the worst.

in general terrible experience<//review><rating>1<//rating>< user_id>

Nothing but good things to say about Moveeast. Used them to move our 1-bedroom from NY to LA and it couldn't have gone smoother. For the move-out, they forgot a few boxes in a closet and the team leader for the day drove 15 miles out of his way in rush hour NYC traffic in his personal car to come get them before we flew across the country the next day, so they made the truck in time. Our stuff showed up in LA sooner than we expected and scheduling delivery was a breeze. Remarkably, nothing was broken in the entire process. Very affordable for what you're getting.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Would 100% recommend  the company. They were fantastic on both ends, both New York and California.

They were completely reliable and came on time both for pick up and delivery. Their storage service was excellent since we needed an extra couple months between moves. I also was very impressed with their communication. We got emails all the time with updates including the exact location of the truck on its way from NY to California. Once the truck arrived we got a prompt phone call from dispatch scheduling our delivery for the next day. The movers themselves were courteous professional and packed and unpacked everything perfectly with no damage.

Also they did not take advantage at all in terms of pricing. They were very fair and stuck to the estimate very accurately. Also, because they are specifically set up to move back-and-forth between New York and California, the movers appeared  to be local and knew the area very well.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c63cc89263c7:0xb475d550b4ac193e< /gmap_id></record>

<text>I recently used California New York Express movers and had a great experience! The process beginning to end was so easy and my stuff arrived very quickly in LA which made all the difference. The administrative/planning staff as well as the movers were a pleasure to work with and I never felt like I was being ripped off (like a lot of other moving companies!). I really appreciated their support through the move and would highly recommend them.</text>< pics>

Absolutely horrible!!!

1. How do you “lose a TV”. I paid extra for you to pack it. I had guaranteed delivery by July 11. It is two days later and there is no update on where my TV is. They said give is an extra week to see if we can locate it! Locate a TV???

2. Insurance claim form is only accepted by mail and with a notary. It is COVID-19 y’all lost my TV and want me to mail you a form instead of sending $

3. I packed the vast majority of my items. The night stand that they packed and covered came with a huge crack down the side. Of the 3 items that you packed (1 was lost and 1 was broken)

I need my TV or a check!! This is ridiculous</Review>

This company has amazing customer service & their movers in NJ helped me estimate my move & helped me pack quickly & efficiently. They informed me of the estimate as we went along which was helpful.

Eric was super responsive immediately & helped me with quotes and sent paperwork immediately.

I landed in Los Angeles & they told me days before & a confirmation the day of that they would be standing by. The movers in Los Angeles made me so happy. I felt so welcomed. Their energy & cautiousness with my furniture to how they put our furniture back together was flawless.

They made my move seamless.

Grateful for them.</Review>< Pictures>

1. Are you willing to be a referral?
Absolutely

2. What did you like or dislike about our service?
Both crews in NY for pickup and LA for delivery were amazing. They were courteous, helpful, efficient and exceptionally careful with all of our belongings. Our move was from NY into a warehouse for six months, then shipment to LA with virtually no breakage or damage. The price was by far the best of any reputable mover, and everyone in the company we spoke with was totally polite and knowledgeable.

3. How can we do better?
You have a great company so just keep doing what you’re doing. We will be pleased to recommend you, and (of course) to use your service again if the need arises.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I wish I could leave 10 stars! This was our first time using professional movers, and we will never look back. From Josh, who set it all up, to both the NY and CA moving teams we experienced the most professional and friendly demeanor. Everything was clear and efficient. It was the easiest of our big move. Highly recommend! Be sure to ask for Josh.< /Review>

<text>I cannot thank CA NY Express enough!  They made my stressful cross-country move easy.  The teams in both New York and Los Angeles were knowledgeable (we moved a grand piano!), efficient, and friendly.  I felt confident that my items were taken care of.

The process was simple, and I felt like I knew what was happening each step of the way.  The estimator came and quickly made an inventory of every item in my Brooklyn apartment.  From there, it was easy to decide how I could trim my items, and they accepted a revised list.  We changed our schedule multiple times, and the team was friendly and understanding about our changing plans.  The day of the move the team showed up and within hours had every item of furniture wrapped, blanketed, and protected, items that could be disassembled taken apart, and every box tagged and numbered with our information.

Once we secured our new home, the team was unloading at our new place in under two weeks.  I received notifications as to where the truck was as it made its journey from the New York warehouse, and a friendly team member called me to set up my delivery to happen on the same day as my items arrival in Los Angeles.  Again, the team at the destination had everything unloaded, items unwrapped, and furniture that was taken apart put back together within just HOURS.

I'm a go-getter kinda gal, who is not afraid to use a drill, but the team insisted I just tell them where to place items, and they would do everything.  I cannot recommend them enough!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Moving was done so smoothly without any hassle. This has been the most stress free move for me ever. There were no issues with overcharge or extra charges as long as you tell them exactly what you are shipping and quantity. I got regular updates about my stuff and scheduling delivery was so easy too. They are so flexible with your schedule. I would recommend them without a doubt.</text>

<Review>When I received a job offer in San Francisco, I was terrified about the thought of moving across the country from New York City. Luckily, a friend had recommended CA NY Express. First off, coordinating with the CA NY team before the move was extremely easy. The company's inventory estimate system was easy to use and helped give me a reasonable quote. In fact, my quote was almost spot on compared to my actual costs incurred. Furthermore, CA NY Express was always responsive when answering all of my emails with questions about the move (Josh was awesome!).
When it came time to move, I was terrified of moving from NYC, but CA NY Express was awesome! They were able to find parking, then quickly packed my belongings and wrapped fragile items with lots of care. I had some old antiques and the team did a great job wrapping them!
During the move, the CA NY Team was great about keeping me in the loop. In addition, my new home in San Francisco was on a narrow street, so they helped coordinate a smaller truck for the move. The team did a great job unloading and I was very happy!

Overall, I would certainly recommend using CA NY Express! I had a very positive experience!</Review>< gmapID>

My husband and I checked out many long distance moving companies in Los Angeles before finally deciding to use CNYX. It would have been a difficult choice but the fast transfer and competitive rates made it a no-brainer once we looked everything over. No stress, just straightforward moving. Highly recommended by us.<//text>

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!!

Incredibly disappointing experience.

After discussing the move-in date on multiple occasions as May 15th and asking what the best pickup date would be to meet that delivery date, he confirmed May 5th.

The movers came May 5th, they were great, and I thought this would be a good experience. Other than the fact that they raised the price $900 for 5 boxes and a bike.

Their emails encourage you not to follow-up. "DON'T CALL US, We're on it".

So, naturally I didn't call when it said delivery date between May 14-20th.
Thinking that they'd do what they agreed to on our numerous conversations.

3 days later I get an email stating they haven't left California. I don't panic, they still have a week to get to NY.

3 days  after that. Same update. Your items haven't left LA.

I call, they're closed at 4:30 on a weekday.

Naturally, I don't get a callback, so I call the next day. They inform me that they're going to LEAVE LA on the 15th and if I had a specific date I should have called earlier?!

Explaining how this was my mistake. Not the employee WHO PICKED the pickup date with me to insure an on-time delivery.
"I should have reached out!" When ALL their emails state NOT TO REACH OUT!

They tell me no need to worry, it'll be delivered on the 19th. It's the 19th. Now I'm told I can't get it delivered today, maybe tomorrow.

I've spent $500 on a room  and a rental car until they show up.
They offered me a 3% discount. $100
We'll see what they've broken tomorrow when I get my stuff. If I get my stuff.

They’ve  broken my wine cooler, swifter and punctured a bike tire.

Tldr:
Their price quotes were grossly  inaccurate.
They have horrendous communication standards.
They hold your items in state for 10 days.
They damage your stuff.</Review>

< review>
I moved with this company in 2015 from NY to LA. The staff - both online and the movers themselves - could not have been more friendly and helpful. They were on time, cordial and incredibly efficient. When I needed movers from LA back to NY in 2018, I knew just who to call. I was able to store my belongings in LA for 45 days with them rather than incur additional costs in NY. Once I had my apartment secured, my stuff was driven from LA. Again, the service was efficient, cost effective and the movers were a great group of guys - especially the foreman Teddy!< /review>

< review>
My fiancé and I have always talked about moving from NY to LA to start a family there. This year we finally got the resolve to do it. Finding the right mover was hard because we’ve both had bad experiences with other companies. I liked how they maintained constant communication as well as having to deal with one company without any subcontractors in between. Highly recommended!</review>

<text>CA-NY Express Movers were super easy to work with. I was very happy with the customer service from start to finish and the price I paid was less than other quotes I got after calling several other companies. Both moving teams at the pickup and delivery were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was broken and everything arrived as planned. Also, I really liked the online tools they have to estimate the cost of the move and the email updates notifying me when my things were on their way were very much appreciated. This is a very professional company at an affordable rate for any cross country move.< /text>< pics>

I moved a 1-bedroom from New York City to the Bay Area (Peninsula).  I surveyed multiple companies for quotes and CA-NY Express gave a competitive quote along with an in-person estimate.  They were prompt in terms of the timing and facilitated an end of month move.

There was no issue or damage with furniture moved including a dresser and a couch. The self-packed boxes did not have an issue.  The movers were friendly in reconciling the lists on both ends.  In addition, once the truck was moving across the country, you received an email with a daily update on where the truck was.  I would recommend the company for another move.<//Review>

Delivery was on time, clean and professional. Checked out the inventory on arrival and made sure every item arrived, cleaned up after unpacking.
- In home inventory and estimate and I paid not a cent more.
- Other movers were charging if 18 wheeler won't have access to pickup or delivery locations but CA-NY Express estimate has them included and less than other movers' base estimates.
- Pickup and delivery was within the estimated time provided.
- Daily status updates were provided.
- As others noted, they said they would reward for the review but never asked for positive review. This is my real experience.< /Text><username>Suresh Deevi<//username><rating>5< /rating>< time>

We couldn't have had a better experience! 3000 miles of moving from NY to CA, a month of free storage in LA, with fast and courteous service. Nothing was broken or damaged. No hidden costs. No bait and switch. I have already and will continue to recommend this company. Thank you CA NY Express!<//text>

<text>I had two moves that your company took care of for me. One was local in LA and the other was west coast to east coast. I have to say that both moves were seamless in that both crews did an exemplary job in executing both moves. I would highly recommend your company based on my experiences. From the beginning with the visit from your estimator David to the final execution and deliveries for both moves your company did an outstanding job and I happen to be a very critical individual.
Thanks Again</text>< Pictures>

I 100% recommend CA NY Express for any long distance move. I have used them twice now to move back and forth cross country and both times, the service has been impeccable. They are thorough, competent and kind. All my belongings were numbered and counted and everything go there in one piece I got updates on where my things were each step of the way. Moving can be so stressful and knowing that everything was in the hands of these guys made it so much easier. 5 stars.</Review>

<review>My husband and I were beyond impressed with California New York Express! It was our first time using movers, and from start to finish we felt informed and supported. From the video links on how to pack, to the day-of move, to then helping us assemble our furniture at our destination, our movers helped us every step of the way. To top if off, all of our items were accounted for and arrived in one piece. California New York Express was also the cheaper option by far. A win-win all around.

Highest recommendation to CA-NY Express.
I had to reschedule my move 3 times before I could lock in a date - they never lost their patience with me. Always accommodated my questions and changes and kept my confidence in the process high.

They were on time, energetic & friendly, brought their own supplies to protect my items further, clearly explained every step of the process. Over phone and email the communication and response time was outstanding. Clearly their operation is a well-oiled machine. The teams in both NY and CA seemed really happy doing the job. A cross country move like this could have been very traumatic and these guys kept my confidence and energy high.

Honestly they were the highlight of my move. Don't let the low estimate fool you - these guys have this process down so efficiently no quality is lost.< /Text>

I moved from NYC to LA and California New York Express Moving did an AMAZING job packing and shipping absolutely everything.  All the movers were professional and polite, and extremely efficient. They packed up my entire apartment in NY where I'd lived for almost 10 years, and got it to Los Angeles in less than a week.  When everything arrived they were incredibly organized and thorough about making sure everything was here and accounted for.

I would definitely use them again (though I sincerely hope it's not anytime in the near future) and I recommend them highly to anyone who needs to move!<//text>

I can't recommend these guys more highly. I've used them several times for moves between CA and NY and every time they've come in at the exact quote they gave me. The movers themselves are excellent and careful - I've never had a problem with any of my items. The customer service team is quick to respond and helpful. Solid company.< /Text>

My husband and I were nervous about moving all of our things from San Francisco to New York City, but the crew made sure all our belongings arrived on-time and in great condition. CA-NY Express were really fast too - they had our things to our new apartment in 8 days, which was 3x as fast as any moving company. When we called their customer service line for a status update on our move, the agent was very polite and gave me real-time updates. We felt well taken care of and important to the movers during the entire process.
CA-NY Express is definitely high value for cost. We will certainly be using the team again in the future if we ever move back to San Francisco. Thank you CA-NY Express for taking the stress out of a stressful event!</review>< pictures>

Courteous and professional is how I would describe everybody I worked with at California New York Express! From the beginning to the end, they all worked efficiently and quickly! And about a week later, from New York to California, they arrived at my front door! And all along the way, they emailed me every few days to let me know what city they were in. The movers were very friendly both in New York and California. And they worked very hard (about a half a dozen) and non stop until everything was packed and then unpacked. Everything was labeled and checked both ways, with a list of what was in each box!
I'll always use California New York Express!</text>

<review>When moving from NY to LA, I went with California New York Express because I was not moving too many items, they had decent reviews, the price was good, and I liked that I worked with just one customer service person.

The pick up was a little chaotic because they came a day before I had planned (although, after looking at my order they had arrived on the right day). They helped us complete the packing and were personable and friendly.

Our order arrived as expected with all items in good shape after just seven days during one of the busier parts of the year. I received my email updates every day as advertised and there is nothing that they could have improved on to enhance my experience. I would really recommend them!</review><name>Justin Haines</name><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

I was so pleased with the first time I used CA-NY (NY to SF) that I booked them again for my move back (SF to NY)! They made the actual move the least stressful part of the equation and for that they deserve 5 stars. They are on time, friendly and they don't nickel and dime you. Highly recommend.</Review>

<text>We found CA NY Express on a blog that was happy with them and so are we. They were super personal in the pre-moving process, explaining everything. To be honest, my wife and I didn't do the best job packing or with our inventory as we were doing it remotely and giving it our best guess. We didn't sign up for partial pack but the guys when they showed up quickly looked at what we had done, and explained the cheapest option. For us that was buying 3 wardrobe boxes and putting some of our loose stuff in those. They were fast and furious packing up and wrapping mattresses, art work and couches. Our stuff actually beat us back to LA because we were in Kansas City for the weekend. Our stuff was delivered on our first preferred day and nothing was broken including not one BUT TWO HUGE mirrored desks. We had just expected that they would be broken, but not even a crack! The best part is the estimate and the actual price were only $200 different, moving companies usually add all kinds of hidden fees when they show up and we hadn't done the best prep or inventory job so we were expecting $1000-$2000 over our estimate. We were super happy when $100 was the difference. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE GUYS!</text><Name>Clayton Jones< /Name>< Pictures>

<review>The guys were friendly and punctual, the office communicates just the right amount before, during, and after the move, and you get daily updates on the location of your stuff as it makes its way across the country.

The cost was very competitive and the delivery window was the same or better than I received from other movers.

It was a pleasure doing business with them.</review>< rating>

No Dislike at all. Courteous, Available, On time, Careful, Efficient, Informative, Price was perfect & most of all honest. Crazy to go with any other company. The suppos'ed "BIG" companies said stay away from the "smaller" ones. I didn't and was so happy, especially the service I received for the cost I paid.<//review>

<text>I have used Ca to NY express twice now and both were great experiences. The team that packs and drops your stuff is really nice and professional. I would recommend them for anyone looking to move.﻿ The only thing that I would suggest is that when I had my stuff dropped off in New York and Packed up their were 4 movers and things moved quickly but in LA there were 2 movers so it took time.<//text>< userid>

Called this company 4 days before I needed to move from NYC to LA, right before Christmas. They were really easy to schedule with, I received a quote immediately while on the phone (which was the same as what I paid), 3 guys came to pack up everything (very thorough) and 7 days later all of my belongings are in LA unharmed (including a flat screen & other delicate pieces)-- also 12.26, thank you!

If you're nervous about certain high value items, wrap and/or pack them yourself & get some additional insurance (I used Baker International).

I would recommend to anyone looking to do a cross-country move!<//Review>

< Review>
CA-NY Express Movers made my move so easy. I really couldn't have imaged a smoother process. They did a great job communicating all areas of the moving schedule to me, from cost to pickup. They had the HARDEST WORKING STAFF of movers I've ever seen. They seemed to care about the condition of my items even more than I did. I would definitely recommend them and use them again. Of course, hopefully I don't have to move across the country again any time soon!</Review>

I can't say enough good things about Ca-NY Express Movers. From day one through delivery day, everyone involved has been wonderful to work with on this long-distance relocation. Moving is never easy, but the staff at Express Movers made everything so much better. They were kind enough to keep me informed every step of the way and even took the time to find some ways to save on the moving cost and delivery time. Can't ask for better service.< /Text>

I had a great experience with California New York Express Movers when I moved from New York to California, and then back again. All staff I had worked with were professional, organized, and easily accessible. They were reliable and I was rest assured that my belongings would be handled with care and reach their destination safely and in a timely manner. I have, and will continue to recommend California New York Express Movers.<//review>

CNYX is one of a kind in the world of Long Distance Movers. Their prices are competitive and their service is top notch. They do not use any agents or sub carriers, and provide an A to Z service - all the way from packing to unpacking with complete assembly and positioning of furniture. Delightful.

Long distance delivery schedule is guaranteed and the company is offering $100 refund for each day of unmet delivery schedule. During the move, daily emails convey relevant transit information and the company is flexible with special pick-up and delivery requests.

This is by far the best moving experience available. Highly recommended.</Review>

I recently moved to LA from New York and this service was excellent and the price was fair. Pickup and delivery were on time, the people were friendly and careful, and nothing was broke or missing. Best of all, shipping my goods from one coast to the other took only a week! Can't beat that.</review>

I shopped around with several movers and found their rates to be the most reasonable. The moving employees on both coasts were very professional, respectful and responsible. I also received daily updates on the location of the truck and my items arrived sooner than I expected.

USE THIS SHIPPER. Every aspect of this process was transparent, smooth, trustworthy, and reasonable. Take out cash to tip, because the quality of work these guys do warrants it. An excellent company top to bottom.< /Review>

<Review>I have used California NY Express three times in my move from NY - California.
They are professional, reliable, competitively prices, and on top of their game.
From my first call to schedule the move to the delivery of my things, i know i will be treated well and my belongings will arrive as scheduled in the condition they were sent.
I am now finally done with the bi-coastal transition, but if I weren't, I would call them again!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend California New York Express Moving. Fantastic customer service, fast and above all affordable. When the CNYE movers arrived at my delivery location they were fast and efficient. The week leading up to my delivery I received updates via email letting me know exactly where my shipment was when it would arrive. I can't speak enough good things about California New York Express Moving.<//text>

We just moved from NYC to Los Angeles, and we couldn't be happier with our movers. I worked with Josh who helped organize the move, and he was always prompt with his replies. In general the costumer service was excellent. Also, the movers were fast
and did a great job with our stuff. We moved out a bunch of antique furniture and everything arrived in perfect condition. Side note: we had to increase our estimate by a lot right before the move, and the company was very accommodating and fair. I was nervous
that we were going to get gauged because of how much more we had than we originally estimated, but it was totally reasonable. All in all I highly recommend.< /Text>

<review>We have moved almost 10 times in 10 years for my husband job and my suggestion would be to do not waste your money on full service movers. Moving from Riggewood NJ to Orange County CA costed a staggering 30k USD for a 3 bed two bath house. We chose this guys because of the reviews but the usual scam applies for them as well... lacking of transparency and additional charges that popped up right after they delivered the goods.. guess what when you pay in New Jersey no credit card charges when you pay at the arrival in California a 3% charge. I have refused to pay and I was even open to pay cash in Monday (delivery was on Saturday) obviously they refused it. They left us with a mountain of boxes and additional charge (on top of 30k USD!!!!) would apply if we ask them to haul away the empty boxes. Plenty of damaged  furnitures that they even tried to hide grossly screwing in badly broken leg of the office desk leg. After packing in New Jersey they told us that they should have charged us more because the boxes where more than expected!! (Guess what since the estimator cane we gave away a lot of stuff!!) There is not such a thing like a fix price with this guys. Different name same Scam keep your eyes open and don’t believe in one off pricing.<//review><user>112787891891271764706<//user>< Date>

I recently had sixty boxes of books to ship from the UWS of Manhattan to Long Beach.  In New York, three very helpful young men assisted me with the boxes, and in Long Beach three equally helpful workers unloaded them in good condition after a reasonable 17 days across the country,  and for a reasonable price.  I was certainly satisfied.< /text>

I moved from Los Angeles to New Jersey within 2 weeks. Everyone involved at CA NY Express Moving were very friendly and professional. Customer Care explained to me everything I wanted to know about my move. The email tracker that provided daily updates on where my goods were at along the way made scheduling my travel to NJ and my move-in at my new place so simple and stress-free. The local teams that picked-up and dropped off my goods were both super friendly, very professional, packed my large and fragile pieces AMAZINGLY! Prior to my goods arriving, a call was received to schedule a time for drop off, everything went quickly and everything arrived in tip-top shape.  Very happy with my decision in choosing California New York Express Moving company. Highly recommended!</review>

Two people I know moved with this company and were very satisfied, so I chose them to help me with my move from NJ to CA. Movers were courteous and great on both sides - at pick up and at delivery. Everything got to my new place fast. Communication was good throughout transport of boxes - I was emailed during the move so I knew where my things were and what their progress was to reaching its destination. I like how all the parts of the move were done by company itself and not subcontracted out. So they were in touch with me and held themselves responsible for everything throughout. (I have had bad experiences with a past move from a different company who subcontracted out for pick up, delivery, and storage. So getting everyone on one page and communication was a challenge. If part of the procedure went awry, they blamed the subcontractor). Thank you, CA NY Express!<//text>

<text>I just moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. I was a bit concerned about using this company at first after seeing some of the bad reviews but I did some research and this company seemed to have a good standing with BBB and it fit my budget so I thought I'd take the plunge. Judging by the reviews their San Francisco office doesn't seem to fair as well as the others.

I asked the movers to show up on the early side because I lived on a busy street. They came when I asked them to, which made it possible for them to park right out front my building. I only had to pay $1.25 for parking because they moved an entire 1 Bedroom Apt in an hour. (Not too much furniture, the only big things were the mattress, a kitchen counter, a desk, and a bed frame) Overall they moved 54 pieces for me.

I received an email from them every weekday letting me know where my stuff was. That was very comforting. My things arrived much sooner then I expected, it shipped on a Friday (Same day it got picked up), arrived in LA Thursday, and was dropped off Monday. (10 days over all - they could have come Saturday but it was inconvenient for me so they agreed on monday.)

The movers themselves were very polite and very friendly. They explained what they would do before they moved my stuff into the truck and when they unloaded it. They gave me the inventory from the pick up and let me check off things as they came into the house. They also called out the numbers on the boxes for me to help me find them on the inventory list. This made it so that I knew all of my stuff was in the house and I wasn't scrambling around to make sure I had everything.

I will say that a few of my boxes were a bit banged up but I think that would be common of moving that much stuff across the country. If I had moved it myself the same would have probably happened. Thankfully I packed my very fragile things in small boxes that I then put into a large box. Nothing was broken.

Overall I highly recommend California New York Express. I had a great experience and it made my move a lot less stressful.<//text>< gmap_id>

<text>Recently moved from SF to NJ. At beginning I chose CNY Express because of its reasonable quote (~$2000 for one bedroom apartment with lots of furniture and boxes) based on cubic feet instead of weight. Later on very happy with the nice and professional movers for both loading and unloading. It was delivered in 9 days with every item unscratched, including a all-glass cabinet! Highly satisfied.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Have a pity on yourself - do not do it. It seems like everything that can go wrong went wrong with our move. The truck could not be traced, delivery time was pushed back three times, finally drivers showed up 4 hours late, with no tools to assemble our items, not even box cutters. I offered them my swiss army knife which they stole. Then they drove off without giving me a proper change and left all packing materials inside. They forgot our TV at warehouse and I can go on and on.  Office managers and truck drivers, who looked like complete thugs, yell at each other on the phone in foreign language. Nightmare! Next week I'm actually filing a police report for theft. Enough is said, one of those bottom feeding joints.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1365821297535< /time><rate>2<//rate><user_id>113892392975721230702<//user_id>< name>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>California New York Express was an excellent choice for my moving! I checked several companies, and several of them harassed me when I was requesting infos & prices. CNE was the only company to answer quick with an honest price, & they were super helpful
to me to have an idea on how much it would cost me. At the end I spent the price I thought, absolutely NO damage. I received everything on time & they were kind to delivery me a few days faster than planned for the same price. The movers were excellent & nice
& helpful. They packed a few stuff their selves & did perfectly. They reassembled some stuff at my new place perfectly as well. I will definitely use this company again & I encourage you to do so, I read so many bad things of other companies, Thank you California

High quality moving company with competitive pricing. I was planning on renting a u-haul to drive across country because all the other moving companies quotes were so high and/or not transparent. California New York Express was half the cost of a u-haul and a lot less stress.

Movers were like assassins. They have a crew of 3 and I've never seen people work so fast. Everything got shipped from LA to NY in 1 piece and on the date I had asked to get my stuff delivered (I paid a little extra to get the exact date delivery).

I would highly recommend and I am not easy to please (haha).<//text>

<text>Everything went fine up until they asked to use my bathroom at which point one of the four gentlemen proceeded to steal one of my colognes ($400 bottle).

I do not recommend using these guys despite their competitive price, you will pay the difference in stolen property.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>My husband and I had an excellent experience with California-New York. We were initially interested because of their great reviews and the extremely reasonable price they quoted us - less than half most other vendors ' estimates. We did see a few lower quotes, but all from companies with one-star reviews that mentioned lost and broken belongings, fraud, and vanishing shipments. Given that, we decided to go with C-NY.

The actual move was as good as we'd been led to expect. The office checked in with us regularly prior to the move and let us sign our documents online, which was a big plus. They got to our apartment on schedule, packed up in a good amount of time, updated us regularly on the status of our shipment, and kept precisely to their promised delivery date and time. When I pointed out that they'd tracked some dirt onto our carpet, they offered to arrange for cleaning - on them. And in addition to all this, their original, amazing estimate turned out to be right on the nose.

If you're planning a cross-country move, definitely check these guys out.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c63cc89263c7:0xb475d550b4ac193e< /GmapID></record>

ALL THE ONE STAR REVIEWS ARE AT THE BOTTOM,
YOUR MOVERS BROKE A PIECE OF MY FURNITURE, THE ARM OFF A CHAIR, AND INSTEAD OF INFORMING ME TRIED TO REPAIR IT WITH GLUE AND A SCREW. I AM POSTING THIS ON ALL OF YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA UNTIL I RECEIVE A CALL FROM YOUR OWNER. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.< /review>

<text>Horrible experience.  Not only were the movers late on both the pick up and delivery - many of my items were damaged and the movers were inconsiderate and rude.  At the end of the day DO NOT trust these people with your belongings - it was shocking to see how little they cared about making the situation better and how much they wated to tack on extra charges.  READ YOUR CONTRACT - they make it almost impossible to file claims if your belongings are damaged.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c63cc89263c7:0xb475d550b4ac193e</gmap_id></record>

They were meticulous at packing all of my belongings and had no hidden fees. My stuff got from NYC to LA in only 7 days and whats even better is that they notified me every day as to where the moving truck was. Constantly keeping me in the loop. Their moving guys, drivers, customer service...it's all top notch. Anyone moving from CA to NY should definitely look no further than California New York Express.</text>< Rate>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I used CA for my move from NJ to CA (LA). Having read so many negative reviews for various movers I was very worried about this cross country move; then i stumbled upon CA via Yelp. I read testimonies of so many satisfied customers & I decided to go ahead with California New York Express. They sent "Noel" for estimation & provided me with an guaranteed price (which did not change at all till the end :) ) & this price was lower than the rest of the quotes. On the day of he move the guys were right on time infact they were few minutes early ! Very diligent & professional crew. I got my stuff in LA within 10 days & once the stuff was on road I was informed on day to day basis of the truck location. AT LA the crew which came to offload were even better. I have to move again I will definitely use these guys. Thanks you for a hassle free move!!!</text>< pictures>

I had planned a move out west for a long while but was very skeptical about which company to hire due to the many horror stories you hear and read about on the Internet.  Being that this was a long distance move from one of  the two furthest endpoints in the country to the other, you can imagine my trepidation of having my furniture held hostage, last minute jacked-up prices or worse--lost/missing irreplaceable items.  So, I had whittled down my choices to three companies who were either recommended by friends or via the Internet.  Some had a mix of great and awful reviews, so it was still hard to judge who would be the better company to go with.   In the end, I chose CANY for one of the best reasons offered by Noel who was a charming guy in the NY office who presented an argument I couldn't refute--they have a presence on both the east and west coast, so you can be assured that they have staff that are answerable to problems that come up even after the move, being that they are employees of the company and have a vested interest in doing the right thing.  Otherwise, you can have stellar service moving you and then gorillas rounded up at the other side of the move to unpack you.  My friend in Boston had that happen with another moving company.  Move went off seamlessly until they came to his house.  Since the company was a NY-based company, they had no workers in Boston and hired day laborers who didn't really care about anything other than being paid for the day and so his priceless items were juggled like in a circus act and many things were damaged on his move-in day.  Not a scenario I want to envision or have to encounter on my own.

The move itself--five full days to pack up 35 years of stuff was daunting, but Silas, the foreman was outstanding.  Most of the guys were great (shout out to Tony who killed many trees with tons of paper used to pack  my stuff that took eons to unwrap and more time to unload in Sanitation, but came out undamaged).  A few workers were eh-eh (don't know who in particular put a jar of fish with my books...The jar broke, of course and my books smell fishy!), but overall a nightmare process that I sweated on for months came to an end within a mere 4 days after our arrival.  There were some damages (broken items on the premises itself and others that came damaged) but nothing that couldn't be fixed or repaired.  I did have insurance but some of the items were not covered (for whatever reasons) and another shout out to Perry in the CA Claims dept--who went over and beyond reasonable charges and ensured that I was covered for those items insurance didn't pick up.  All in, nothing was missing out of 548 items which in itself is a miracle.  True, some of the items were misplaced (i.e. dining room tagged items were stuck behind a box in one of the bedrooms and not found till months later), but everything was accounted for at the end of the day.

Even though they were the costliest of the three estimates I had received (so no vacation for the next 5 years!!), I am glad I chose CANY. I plan to move again in the near future and hope that the experience will be as good the second time around with CANY.< /text>

Had the damage happened to goods that we had packed, I could understand their decision to provide a minimal settlement. However, their movers did such a horrible job packing my items and still they would like to offer $100 as a settlement. Never once, did they try to send someone to fix what they broke. In the end, they are very expensive for a HORRIBLE JOB. Find any other company!<//Text>< name>

These guys were great. I was in a bind three days out from move day. (I had issue with other company.) California New York Express came through last minute. Not only were they on time for pick up but delivered our stuff within 6 days. Not business days. They did it in six days...NY to LA. Crazy. My wife and I were kind of blown away by them.  And the price Josh quoted me on phone remained the same the entire way. Moving companies can hit you with charges on the day.They all do it.  We've moved a bunch in the last two years so we're a bit more experienced than most. Before we moved we pretty much knew exactly what stuff we had. (That always helps...everyone needs to be on the same page or else that price will change.) In our case, some of our inventory changed the day before the move, I called Josh and told him of inventory changes. He adjusted price to reflect and it was smooth sailing from there. Remember to ask when booking your move about what charges that could come up on the day. Like Long Carry...if the movers have to carry stuff for more than 100 yards (each company has different amount of yards for it to be considered long carry. And each company does it.) Some charge for stairs and depending on where you live they might have to get a smaller truck to deliver your stuff than a 16 wheeler. If they do need smaller truck you'll get hit with a charge for that too. Just do your research and ask, the all important question, "What kind of charges can I get hit with other than the move itself? Josh at California NY Express will be more than upfront. The delivery teams on both sides of the coast were great. Total pro's and just a bunch of good dudes. We lucked out with these guys and I couldn't recommend them more highly.< /Review>

Beyond helpful and supportive, starting with Eric in Sales, who took 5 calls and answered countless questions from me regarding moving from NYC to LA and how to save money: buy supplies and pack as much as you can in advance. The pick up guys called 30 mins before they would arrive and actually made it a little earlier, didn't charge me for wait time, and were already ready to go when I got there. They divided and conquered so that they packed up 250 cubic feet in less then 45 mins. They wrapped some really important heirloom items and my dainty lamp with a ton of care, and didn't really charge me for additional materials used. And I was actually able to fit more items then I originally thought because they gave me advice on packing more items in less boxes! The guy in charge was super organized and read through every item with me to make sure it was wrapped to my liking and cataloged, so that I would know which # corresponded to which item when moving into my new place. You get 30 days free storage in the city you move out of. I called customer service a few times to ask about policy, travel time from NYC to LA (up to 15 days, but they can push it through quicker if they have some extra notice) and delivery window/days (7 days a week up until 10pm) and Ellie was a doll and beyond helpful. German and his team squeezed me in so that I wouldn't have to miss work to accept delivery (although you can have a roommate or neighbor sign for you, with your written permission) and they were done moving me in / setting up my bed and unwrapping a few items in less then 30 mins. They put boxes in rooms I requested and were out in a flash. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants a seamless and stress-free move. The experience was great and will be using them again when I move downtown in 6 months!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

CA-NY Express Movers are excellent communicators. They make you feel comfortable in preparing for the move, communicate well during the move and are prompt with the delivery.

However, there are 3 things they are really bad at:
1. Packing your stuff
2. Moving your stuff
3. Resolving issues when they break your stuff

We moved from the Bay Area to NYC with CA-NY Express Movers. Having lived in temp accommodation for over a month, we were really looking forward to moving into our own apartment with our own stuff and get the feeling of being at home in a new city.

The delivery team arrived on time and started unloading, after accepting full payment, of course. As the first pieces of furniture starting coming in, my heart started sinking.

We immediately noticed broken furniture and damaged cartons. The delivery crew foreman himself told us that this was really bad packing and that they often see this with the California packing crew. So after paying to pack  and move the furniture, we had to buy the ENTIRE FURNITURE FOR TWO BEDROOMS. Yes, that’s right, two broken beds, two night stands broken, one chest of drawers broken and unstable. And that was all the bedroom furniture we moved an nothing survived the move – so basically we shouldn’t have bothered!!!

Then I start opening the torn/tattered cartons. My delicate show pieces – Crystal, Porcelain, Stained Glass, were literally DUMPED in cartons (And I specifically showed the pieces that required extra care to your moving staff who came to pack). How they survived without breaking is surprising. Horrible packing, no fragile tag.

Next, moving on to the Wardrobe boxes – loose shoes just tossed at the bottom of the carton with my coats on top. To add to that, my umbrellas and other products were thrown in between shoes. I'm just going to guess  these guys who packed my stuff travel with their dirty used shoes just packed in between their clean clothes. To me that is disgusting. Shoes should have been packed separately.

I explicitly mention that my Heeled shoes need care – but it didn’t matter, things were tossed in and my expensive shoes are now damaged.

Multiple items were packed around my TV in the TV box so now the back has a huge dent.

And through all this, I swear I kept my cool. What made me lose it is that toilet waste bins and the bathroom and toilet rugs were packed with my kitchen items. Yes, with my kitchen items and to be specific – WITH SPOONS, FORKS ,PAPER PLATES, MY BABY’S MEDICINE, CANDY and BABY’BOTTLE WASHING BRUSH. How do you get kitchen and bathroom stuff mixed in the same box?

And just in case that was not enough - They packed the 2nd bathroom stuff including a waste bin and shower curtain with my baby’s clothes, toys, sippy cup!

It’s appalling to us that professional packers would not use the common sense to not mix unsanitary products with a baby’s utensils. Is this how they would pack for their own kids whom they chatted with us about while packing?

The amount of washing and sanitizing, throwing away good stuff because it was damaged, drained us more than we would pay a better quality mover.

When we wanted to file a claim for damages, this was made super difficult. We had to get the claim notarized and sent a very specific way for them to consider it.

Once sent, they promptly sent us a claim settlement for $50 for all the things that were damaged, misclassifying many boxes as packed by us, when everything was packed by their crew, misclassifying furniture as not covered.

When we sent them the corrections to their claim settlement, we just stopped hearing back from them.

Please stay away from these guys and find better movers, if you care about your possessions and sanity.<//Text>

As a born and bred NY'er I never thought I would move, much less to the west coast. I made the decision to follow my daughter out to the west coast and after her absolute nightmare with a moving company I was all set to rent a Penske truck and do it myself.  After I made the reservation, I make one last ditch effort to check out moving companies and came across California New York Express and I am so glad I did.  I received a quick response with an inventory list  which I filled and sent back. I was given a quote that never changed throughout the process. I had a relatively small move but my box count was continually changing and I partnered with Elizabeth who was my LA representative who assured me I was still within my quote.  I knew enough to ask questions to make sure there would be no hidden or extra charges and they were upfront with the information and documentation as to what would cost more money i.e. if they needed to wrap or box anything, it would cost you.  I had everything boxed and taped myself, all they did was pick it up and put it on the truck, it took all of 40 minutes.  I received emails letting me know where my stuff was throughout the journey and I set up delivery w/ a third party and it went smoothly at that end as well.  My only advise is to READ the info they send you carefully, it will outlay any additional charges in black and white.<//Review>

Moving an apartment of furniture cross-country by myself from New York to California was a daunting process. I compared prices between a number of moving companies and was impressed by the affordable rates provided by CANYX. Once I requested a quote, I began a line of communication with a very helpful customer service representative at the company, who promptly answered all and any questions I had via email and phone. After deciding to use CANYX, the process to organize my move went smoothly, with an easily accessible online inventory that I could update up to 72 hours before the move. I was also able to schedule the pickup and delivery dates with no problem, and I booked about a month in advance to my move.

On the day of the move, the movers arrived in the provided time frame and Ivan (I think!), the man I assumed to be in charge, went through everything with me beforehand and afterwards. He and his two other movers were all extremely polite and incredibly efficient, packing and wrapping everything carefully, and even dissembling a patio table.

After they left, I received frequent email updates informing me of the progression of the shipment, and in about week, my belongings were in California ready to be delivered. Because I hadn't moved yet, I authorized my roommate in Los Angeles to oversee the delivery, and she also reported to me that the movers were very friendly, quick, and efficient, and arrived during the designated window.

A cross-country move is incredibly stressful, and I am so grateful to CANYX for making it as painless and easy as possible!</Review>

<date>1439417984090<//date><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>The people who picked up my things in New York were really responsive and easy to work with. Delivery though was another story. They gave me a delivery window between 12pm and 3pm. A little after 3pm I still had not heard from the movers or received my items. So I called the LA office and spoke to an extremely rude man who told me that because I had requested an afternoon delivery time (which is not true, it's just the window that they gave me and in fact I would have preferred a morning delivery time), there was obviously traffic, the truck didn't leave until 1pm, and that they would "get there in a little while". He did nothing to try and get me a better estimate of when my stuff would arrive. Also, even if I had requested the afternoon delivery window, if a company guarantees that something will be delivered between 12pm and 3pm, then you have a responsibility to deliver it during that time. For what you pay to have things moved across the country I would expect a little bit more professionalism and courtesy, and not to be dismissed by the person in their dispatch unit who can't even do his job properly.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

They are very bad at their job and they have no customer service after you "sign".
they crushed my shipment, everything is beyond broken, damaged and destroyed, basically i have to call a garbage company to pick everything up.
It too them over 2 months to even respond to damage, its been over 6e months and they refuse to send someone to look at the damage even though their own driver wrote "MAJOR DAMAGE" on their paperwork on day of delivery.
I use and deal with shipping?trucking companies due to my business as a designer, have done so for over 27 years and have never dealt with this kind of damage and  negligent and lack of customer service or integrity...
do yourself a favor and delete their name from your list, they have so many complaints and issues, their permit was taken away at least twice and so on.
i got fooled by their rep in NJ, should have looked into them more.
taking then to court now, had over $75,000.00 in damage.<//text><userid>104709192853693688807< /userid>< Name>

Forced me to have a mask on while waiting. Which is dumb. I was the second one in line first thing in the morning. I had to wait over an hour before I even got called to the back. This was my very first appointment here. Definitely not coming back. Worst experience at a dentist in my life.<//text>

<Review>It’s worse service  ever..... , I Don’t recommended them.
I scheduled an appointment in that location by phone  , she asked me this is the first time, I said yes, and i told her i have Insurance ( that my insurance provided that location( in a network))  before one week and I went to the dentist before 3 days to make sure everything are ok , I talked with Jessica at that dentist and she wrote me that card .
Today I went to my appointment and i surprised, she said to me : i have to call your insurance to make sure in a network!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and today Saturday are closed.
She did mistake , supposed to be when i went to the dentist before 3 days ago she has to call the insurance because it’s shown in a system ( follow the procedure) .
No sorry to me  .

They are the worst dentist I have ever had to deal with. I visited the location on elk horn blvd and have had to wait six months to get a simple teeth cleaning. Every time I had an appointment I would show up to be told the person who cleans teeth was not in. I missed work twice and after that the next two appointments I received were rescheduled  the day before because of the same issue. After calling and complaining they scheduled me an appointment at 8 this morning I show up at 7:45 and after waiting until 8:30 I am told they are going to do X-rays and I cannot get my teeth cleaned. They are absolutely ridiculous  and will lie to you in order to keep you from making a big deal about anything I would not recommend this place to anyone, they really need to either get new employees who do not lie or reevaluate how they handle their patients.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>We moved to citrus heights not long ago and decided to pick this western dental because of the reviews and because it's close to our new home. I think something changed as of recently because this can't be the same place that has 4.5 stars! The place was dirty, very rude front ladies and I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt on my first visit. The hygienist was the best I must say. I went ahead and scheduled an appointment for my husband but since it was during the holidays he wasn't scheduled until today (01/21/2021). Well he took the day off and went only to find out that the office was closed! I called and they said that unfortunately they closed for the day with no warning! Or rescheduling!
Some other customers were also waiting in line when my husband broke the news to them they all said its happened many times before. STAY AWAY FROM THIS WESTERN DENTAL.  We will be seeing a different clinic now and unfortunately my husband is out a day of work and still with tooth discomfort.< /Text>< Pictures>

You wait 2 hours to see the dentist every time faithfully why schedule my appt at 230 if your not going to deal with me til 430. Its like a part time job coming to this place. My time is valuable too

Than they messed up my crown and had to send it back 2 times this is thee worst dental experience I have ever had in my life. They should give a no star option<//review>

<Text>This place need to be shut down! They never have appointment availability for those that have an emergency 🚨 they are always booked and when you come in for an appointment they always take forever to call you to the back what’s the point of having an appointment at a certain time if they don’t comply with patients appointment hour... This place needs to be shut down! Don’t stress I recommend you go somewhere else.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1608659970388, 'text': "Hello Candis, we're so sorry to hear about your experience.

This place has been a complete waste of time. Me and my wife had three back to back appointments for regular general dentistry, but in all three instances the door was closed and in tow instances nobody was there was nobody or in other words it was a dead zone. When we called the customer service, they expressed unawareness. Don’t recommend at all!<//review>

STAR RATING
Everyone was so friendly and helpful.. the dental hygienist Jolley was so careful to make sure that I didn't have any pain during my deep cleaning procedure. His assistant Tammy was so friendly and helpful such a big smile. Delaney was also very happy and helpful and setting appointments and dealing with financial affairs. The office was very clean and quiet and well-organized. I would be happy to recommend this dental office to any of my friends relatives or acquaintances.</Text>

It takes nothing less than three hours every time I go there. Twice lately I had to reschedule because one of the dentists called out. The financial advisor left without seeing me, and they had asked her to see me before she left. She just left me waiting in the chair, and didn’t come back. My dentist was absolutely amazing and so was all the other office workers! The one I’m upset about is the financial advisor. She knew that she needed to come talk to me but just left instead, leaving me to sit in the chair numb, and with my bad tooth exposed no longer with it’s crown. I wasn’t able to speak with her so I couldn’t be told any options, and couldn’t move forward for extraction. You have to sign a payment plan etc to get the work done!!! But I as the patient was unable to speak with any financial advisor to do anything to move forward. The dentist was doing his best to make me leave in a comfortable manner. He again did a great job as always!<//review>

<Review>This is my second time bringing my daughter here. They say she is not assigned here while before coming I specially and specifically called this place to confirm that she is assigned with them and she has appointment. When I showed up today they told me the second time that my daughter was not assigned to this place. The lady on the counter was nice and fixed the issue after calling the office.<//Review>< username>

ZERO, THEY MAKE COMMISSION ON APPOINTMENTS BOOKED... they will tell you you need treatment you don't and then do a poor job, they took all of my teeth out on top and gave me the worst fitting/looking denture, I found out from my previous DDS when I returned to her office that my teeth were pulled unnecessarily.<//Review>

Once I finally got seen, the staff was wonderful. The wait, however, was less than desirable. My first appointment had to be rescheduled after waiting over two hours and forty five minutes. I had had enough. The second appointment I wait an hour before being seen. Other than the wait, the staff is great!<//Text>

When I arrived to my appointment I was politely greeted by the receptionist. The waiting area was nice, clean and comfortable. Even though there were about  10 other patients waiting I was called in to the back in about 20 minutes which okay because after my visit understood why. The back office was just a clean and comfortable. Christian who is training to be the office supervisor was very pleasant and he made sure that I was comfortable. Jolly was the dental hygienist who performed my deep cleaning. I was nervous but Jolly took his time and was gentle.  I was only scheduled for a deep cleaning but I really needed to get my fillings taken care of because I had a cavity  and a chip tooth in the front of my mouth. Jolly asked the dentist would he have time to fill my tooth and fix the chipped one. The dentist (whom I can't remember his name) said that he would see if he could make time that he had three clients. When he couldn't fit me in he ask Dr. Sing (I hope that I spelled his name right). Dr. Sing came and introduced himself and said that he would help me. Dr. Sing is WONDERFUL! He took his time and when I tell you he worked on my chipped tooth like an master of his craft. When he was done my tooth was a perfect match to the others. I left the office smiling my beautiful smile again feeling great! Western Dental on Elkhorn is the best dentist office that I've ever gone to and as long as the staff and dentist that are there remain there then so will I. I will be switching my kids to that office as well. To the people who want to complain about the wait time I would like to say this. Who wants a dentist or hygienist who rush with their clients? I appreciate the time and attentiveness that I received at the office and all of the beautiful people who work there. You can tell they are doing this work because they care. Thank you.

< Review>
Greatest dentist I've been to by far  and I'm glad I came. The dentists are so friendly you feel like they genuinely care for you and want to give you the best service. I've never had any altercations with anyone, in fact I have had quite a few great laughs. My favorite people are the dentists in the orthodontist section, they are all like family to each other and that light friendly air makes you feel comfortable. Aside from that, I mean braces are expensive just like anywhere but they really do take care of you to try their hardest to give you the greatest results in the end.< /Review>

Been going to western dental for a little over a year now. More specially the Folsom location. All the staff there from the front desk girls to the people in the back are the best. From the doctor to Laura to Brenda to all of them. Every time I have an appointment they make sure I’m well taken care of and they keep me laughing and smiling. Wouldn’t want to go to any other orthodontist. Keep up the good work guys!<//Text>

I normally don't get excited about my visits but today was different. Staff members are amazing Tileina was very helpful and kind. She took her time to explain things to me because English is my second language and I can appreciate someone who doesn't brush me off because I don't understand them very well.</text>

Great and friendly staff. Even when they're short staffed and running around trying to take care of multiple patients at a time, they still make sure to make you feel wanted and like every patient is important. Judith the lady in charge of insurances was very friendly and made all the hard insurance information very easy for somebody like me who knows nothing about it.

Jolly, my dental hygienist was great at making you feel safe and has a very soothing voice that easily reassures you that you're in good hands. Trust me on this you are in good hands with him. He worked with me every step of the way and took extra time to explain things in full details so I knew what I needed to do for great oral care after my visit.

For the life of me I cannot remember their names, and I'm sorry, but the back house supervisor and both my dentist that worked on me were also very friendly and professional. If you need anything they'll assist you right away. If you're in too much pain they'll take a break and give you time to breath. If the pain is too unbearable they'll even use more numbing shots to take away the pain. They make jokes and like to have fun there because who like to goto a boring dental office right?

All in all this staff is very friendly, fun, professional and hire great employees. I will be coming back often. I hope you do too!< /text>

Love the dentist and the assistants. Always nice and positive. When I come into the office I'm seen almost right away. Longest time I had to wait was 20 minutes and that's when it's really busy. Other than that I am in and out within half an hour. That's counting the waiting time and the time it takes to do what needs to be done. Highly recommend coming to this Western Dental and Orthodontics.< /text>

<review>Called the local number for this office & advised the guy who answered I needed an appt today or Saturday if possible & gave him all of my insurance info. & was advised I couldnt get into that location @ those times. Spent an hour on the phone while he called a few other locations after waiting on hold was told no other Western Dentals anywhere could get me in I proceeded to just assign me 2 the closest office & make the appt.(next Thurs 4 an emergency) so I called my ins.2 advise& after being put on hold with them while they confirmed this, I was told sorry, they are not taking immediate transfer patients.??? What? So apparently the Western Dental Call Center & Western Dental locations do not talk 2 each other. The ins. Person told me its a mess & its been like that 4 a while now..What a waste of my time! Very disapointed. Literally was @ this half the day. Still dont have a dentist. Have a broken tooth & an emailed list of dentists that may be able to take me but of course its 5pm now. Thanks 4 nothing Western Dental!</review><resp>None< /resp>< date>

<Review>Stay away from this place, they are just terrible. I had an appointment for 11:30, when I got there, after filling paperwork, they said they need to verify my insurance coverage and do other paperwork, so they want me to come back at 2:00.
When I came back at 2:00 they said doctors went for lunch break and they won't be back until 3:00. The girl at the front desk was encouraging me to book an appointment for another day (getting rid of me)! I said no and I'll wait, at 4:00 another one finally called me to the front desk and after spoke with me, turned out that they don't have oral surgeon and don't extract wisdom teeth there. The day before when I booked the appointment over the phone, they said the exact opposite thing.
I wasted my whole day off for nothing.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Time>1504117240122</Time><Review>After having a fairly good consultation visit, I'm sad to say that I will be no longer seeking dental care from this particular place. Not only did I get a terrible dental assistant for two of the three visits, where she barely spoke to me and even hassled me at the last appointment to make another one, but the fillings I received were poorly executed and one has cut up my mouth. After trying to get an appointment to fix it, I was told that I had to fit it into their time table and they were unwilling to find a day and time I could work with. Therefore, it would be my suggestion that if you go here, you make darn well sure that they do everything to perfection or find another place to get your dental work.</Review>< pics>

This western dental. It's the most unprofessional place ever!!!! All the way down to the DOCTOR AND STAFF. I CALLED AT 8am to get am emergency appointment. I was happy to hear that they had an appointment for me today.  Took off work.  Drove an hour to get there and the staffs straight up told me  the doctor don't want to stay late and they can't take me.  AS THEY CAN LOOK AT ME AND TELL THAT MY FACE IS SWOLLEN AND I CAN BARLY TALK.  STILL TOLD ME THEY CANT SEE ME.  How unprofessional!!! They didn't offer to make me a different or offer me to a different location. I asked to speak a manager. And there's no one to speak to !!!!! I would not recommend going to this place at all !!!! No respect for the patients what's so  ever !!!!</Review>

If you don't want to read this whole review, let me sum it up, don't go to Western Dental for you dental needs, especially this location! There are trying steal your money! I spent $1287 just on deep cleaning alone; which my mom says it not good for you cause it can damage the good part of your teeth, and other places does deep cleaning for way cheaper. $800 should be the max. And then they don't tell you about the add on tooth bush kit that give, which cost $197! You can get a way better toothbrush at Costco a lot cheaper, or even at other places. And now, I'm trying to figure what's going on about my interest, I think I'm being overcharged. I called the corporate billing #, and they transferred me to the office I signed the contact with (this office). But the first time, they just hung up. Shake my head. Then, I call my office directly, and they tried to transfer me back to corporate billing #. And now I'm trying again, calling my office. I am writing this as I'm being put on hold. I've been put on hold for 34 FREAKING MINUTES! I think they are not answering on purpose! So after I pay off this last payment, I'm not going to go to Western Dental for my dental needs, or at least this office! My mom has been to this office too, and she didn't like it. They lied to her. My old office at Florin was a little better. I only moved to this location because it was closer to where I live now. This is totally unacceptable! I would even rate  stars if I could, just horrible.

So finally this person answered, and told me that they don't handle interest at the office level. So what is the point of my calls? #I'mdonewithwesterndental. This has been an honest review. Thank you for reading and hope all of you don't make mistakes like I did.</Text>

By far the WORST DENTAL PLACE EVER! Doctor numbs my husband and asks him "can you feel that?" my husband responds "yes" and what does the quack do? Grabs his tooth with the pliers and BREAKS IT IN HALF! Naturally, my husband is SCREAMING  in pain. And the doctor says..."Oh is that pain or pressure?" I'm beyond livid and am consulting with lawyers. My husband ended up in the emergency room with symptoms of shock due to the traumatic experience. Don't EVER go here. ESPECIALLY with your children!< /Text>

I just had the best experience ever both Delaney and Yer took care of me today. It has been a long time since I had my appointment. I just had a great time in check in today because of their smile that that gave a reason to be a great and happy costumer for Western Dental. They both treated me with respect and just had a very positive attitude and put me in a positive mood. I am so happy they work for Western Debtal and thanks for their smile they brought to me just by them ahowing their smile and giving such good customer service. I walk in happy and I am walking out happy with a nice bright smile. Thank you Delaney and Yer for making me smile and having such great customer service skills. That really does make a good difference :)<//Text>

<text>0 stars! try to avoid this place
First off the tall Russian dentist lady tried to convince me to get a molar pulled because she said it is going to go bad and hurt in less then a year, so she said pull it and get an implant. When I refused she looked at me like im a complete moron for not taking a "dentists" advice. Well guess what you rude obnoxious woman? It has been 2 years and no problems! They just want your money.
Second the people in the front desk are complete uneducated workers. They are very rude and you will be better off talking to a wall for your answers. Recently they made me wait an hour and half before telling me I should come back a different day. REALLY?? People have responsibilities, jobs, kids, you cant just mess with their schedule like it is garbage. screw this place<//text>< gmapID>

<review>Went in a few weeks ago after scheduling cleaning/exams for my kids. I get there and am told I have to reschedule because ortho wasn’t in that day. So, I reschedule for this past Monday at 2pm. 3:30 comes and they FINALLY verify my insurance (after they removed their wires and bands). 5pm rolls around and they finally finish the exam but SURPRISE! Took so long that the orthodontist left before putting the wires and bands back on. They tell us to come back Wednesday (today) between 1 & 4. We get there at 1 and are told that they won’t put them back on because payment has to be made prior to any ortho work (excuse me?! It would have all been done on Monday had they been more timely!)- my daughters have
torn up lips for being sent home 2 days ago minus wires and bands.... So I pay,l (even though the ACTUAL ortho appointment isn’t until the 29th and payment was supposed to be made prior to THAT day. We go back, they put everything on, only to find one of my daughters has neon purple bands on top and burgundy on bottom (she is 15 so this is a big deal, never mind that we PAY for this to be CORRECT!) we ask that the fix it real quick and are told “no, we are too busy”. Are you EFFING KIDDING ME?! They didn’t mind making us wait 4 hours on Monday and have to come back again 2 days later to finish their job! I call to file a grievance, get hung up on when asking the customer “service” reps name. I go to another location to see about switching at least to better OFFICE STAFF and apparently you can’t change ortho locations unless you travel over 1.5 hours to get to your current office. Total joke- surprises me that these people are even in business anymore!<//review>< pics>

They did fillings and a short time later they all fell out, my dental cleaning only took less then 2 minutes,  witch really all dental cleanings usually take 30 minutes.  I would never go back to this place, thier work is always hurried and very pore quitly.<//Text>

This place is great!!! Cammie got me braces here and she was really friendly from the start and I've been coming here for months now and all the dentists and my Ortho, Dr. Trinh are very helpful and optimistic. I like how patient the front desks receptionists are esp for ortho I like Myra, always smiling. I recommend this specific branch for anyone who needs braces</Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU CAN AVOID IT.

I called for an EMERGENCY extraction appointment due to a tooth being broken off at/below gum-line, and went in to said appointment the following day.  I get all the paperwork, x-rays, etc, and wait for a couple hours.  Nothing happens.  Finally I am told I must continue to wait for almost an entire month to see an oral surgeon.  To make matters worse, they send me away with an Rx for some un-needed antibiotics and only FIFTEEN pain pills to last throughout that entire wait period!  I realize that they cater to the "low/no-cost" crowd, but that doesn't mean you have to skimp on legitimate PAIN PILLS!!!  If you can't help in an EMERGENCY, say so and refer your patients out to someone who CAN!

DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU CAN AVOID IT.< /Review>< name>

I have western dental as my assign provider for over 3 months. I have not seen a dentist although I  have had 4 scheduled appts. They ask me to pay a collection fee that apparently belongs to me but they have no paperwork of any kind and some information does not match. I still agree to pay in the mean time so I can see some one hopping ones Its all clear they would need to provide me with documentation of what I pay. Happens to be That they schedule my appointment, the collection has not yet been cleared although customer service made a note on system. All these retarded,  lazy receptionist have to do is grab the phone and confirm the information. But they obviously have lack of customer service and care less about customer retention.  I'm pregnant and so done of fighting with them!< /Text>

<review>If I can rate this place a 0 I would love to..
Let me start by saying this, the customer service is horrible! Very unprofessional! Don't have a clue what there doing and lack of communication between each other.  I went to Europe to visit my family and when I return western dental said that my account was in collections so I paid the entire contact almost $1,300 I had my bank statement showing I paid and I booked my appointment through corporate and they scheduled me almost a month later, when I got there they were extremely RUDE! I explained to her YES I did pay the entire contact she said no you didn't, but they had already brought my son back there and so she went back there and told my son to go back with your mom!  Completely e ridiculous!!  and couldn't be seen! so I wasted a trip from Davis to Sacramento in after work traffic, she said I don't know why they booked you, she said to call corporate and of course the office was closed.  She also said that I should have went through the office but I also tried to explain that when you call I get directed  to corporate!!!   RUN!
Waste of money!  Rude staff!  No one knows what there doing total lack of communication among each other.  I had 3 accounts through western dental I pay all in cash!!  Paid them all in full!  No one needs to be treated like crap!
When you call corporate to explain your story they come up with all excuses!  And no one will connect you to someone who actually is important to speak to, you get the run around!
This is the western dental/ortho on Elkhorn Blv.
In Sacramento CA.    The rude unprofessional lady her name is Camie.   She's in the ortho dept.     my name is Debra
Read all of western dental reviews 1st.
From all there offices!

My son has been extreme pain all night cryibg non stop because his tooth since it was a Saturday his office wasn't open and the only place that was open was this place . He used to be seen there but he had been assigned to another dental office and was going to a different place but due to his pain and his office being closed on Saturday .  I called and made an appointment with the western dental on elkhorn and when I did call I explained everything to them and told them I understood he wasn't assigned there but he needed to be seen and will pay for whatever was possible I basically would of been a cash patien .  I came to his appointment and checked him in the lady then told me that even though im paying cash they can't see him because he wasnt assigned there . I argued with her explaining that there the only place open and I don't want them using my insurance just let me pay for his visit and any treatment needed . she tried telling Me it would be fraud if they seen him and took my cash and said to go to emergency room . By then I'm upset to where I'm crying because my son has been in so much pain and I know er can't really do nothing but give him meds witch I already had . I ended up taking him to urgent care and explained what they told me they said that was illegal and they can not deny care Even though he wasn't assigned there and I was offering to pay whatever.  They told me to file a grivence because what they did was wrong and should have seen him . Not to mention when I went into western dental there was only one person waiting in waiting room . They  illegally denied my son and sent him away for no reason . I will be fileing a grievance and be contacting the dental board.  Now I would of understand if I wasn't offering to pay but I had cash and credit card ready and they still denied him.  This place is wrong and what they did was horrible.</Text>

<text>The reason I'm giving you guys 3 stars is because 1 your staff members are nice and all 2 the wait can be litteraly unbelievable like when I make an appointment to se the dentist they say oh your appointment is at 1:30 today and the really the wait is like 3 hours so basically 4:00 and 3 I hate how I go in the ortho for my appointment and they never say what they're doing or what they're planning on doing they literally just ask you how your day is and then put colors on your teeth and then say ok your done like litteraly your not going to even tell me what your doing to my mouth and I think you guys need to change that other than that it's doing ok for now<//text>< username>

(Translated by Google) Terrible attention I have been wanting my son's teeth to be checked for more than a year, I understood because the pandemic happened but since they reopened I have missed 2 appointments because I make the appointment early to leave my work on time and they spend more than 2 hours without That they attend him and always the same excuse, that there are only one or 2 doctors and that is why it is late and they give me the option to change the appointment; very easy for them why better not do something to change their service. I do not recommend it, I already change

(Original)
Malísima atención llevo a más de un año queriendo que revisen la dentadura de mi hijo, lo comprendí porque aconteció la pandemia pero desde que reabrieron he perdido 2 citas porque hago la cita temprano para salir a tiempo de mi trabajo y pasan mas de 2 horas sin que lo atiendan y siempre la misma excusa, que solo hay uno o 2 doctores y por eso esta tardado y me dan la opción que cambie la cita; bien fácil para ellos porqué mejor no hacen algo para cambiar su servicio. No lo recomiendo yo ya me cambie</text>

Melanie is one of the customer service representatives for the company and everytime me and my family go through for detailing, she provides outstanding services! Honestly, the place is awesome with competitive prices. However, they need to fix their vacuums, because they don't entirely detail to expectations, and are low on suction power!!!<//Text>

Drive through carwash. Be sure to pay the extra $3 for the big blow dry at the end.
Machines did a good job.</text>

Great, clean, convenient, fast car wash, a much needed addition to Pleasanton! An affordable car wash that prioritizes sustainabilty.  Kids get lollipops and dogs get dog treats! Make sure you get your free dash wipe, too.

Update: This is not a fake review. The owner let us trial the car wash early. The car wash is also now open.<//Text>

Pretty decent service. Prices are just a lil more than the regular drive thru washes. Best part? Getting to use the vacuums and getting all the crevices that other hands on washes miss</text>

<Review>This is machine-wash service. Pretty fast and good service. They did pretty well. The vacuum is self-service and free. The quality of vacuum machine is awesome. I went on Sunday around 10 am. There was no rush so I took my time to vacuum my car and I am pretty happy with the overall value of money. This was my first time and I will come here again. I recommend this place.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

<review>Omg this is the car wash I have been looking for. I came all the way from Stockton and I'm impressed. The staff are extremely friendly. They have a car wash that actually cleans your car right. My car looks amazing. Where they really stand out is in the free to use vacumns. They have air blower guns. No other car wash has that and it makes a big difference in getting your interior clean. They also have a vending machine with after care products including micro fiber towels if you forgot to bring one. My car has never been cleaner. This is truly a car spa not a car wash. Lol. I got the 44.95 epic membership and I love this place so far. So much better than about 6 other car washes I've used</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Take your time vaccuming with good tools after driving through the wash with all sorts of options.  I skipped the buff at the end.  I usually do a touchless wash at home, but this is good in a pinch.</Text>

Brand New car wash that has self serve vacuum stalls. The vacuums are great, too bad that they use a rail system that tracks your wheel finish and spinning brushes that leave swirls in the paint...<//Text>

< review>
This is a nice addition to the neighborhood and more inviting than the traditional small one-car-at a time gas station car wash places... and they have female employees that make me feel less intimidated... it’s brightly lit and open... with a huge lot and high powered vacuum and compressed air hoses that hang down like tentacles attached to some futuristic robotic beast, but it’s super convenient, albeit quite loud with all the suction and air flow that doesn’t turn off... you just pry the hose down, off of the felt like stopper, use it, and then replace the nozzle back up. While there is a recommended time limit for vacuuming in the lot, they won’t kick you out and everyone I’ve seen is conscientious and works quickly and then clears out of the lot. There’s a little outdoor sink, trash cans, and a bathroom but I think it’s closed due to covid...<//review>

Really nice place for car wash. Free vacuums in a dedicated place is the best thing. There is also a high pressure air pipe along with the vacuum which is helpful to blow away dirt from places where vacuum can’t reach. Price is reasonable and worth it. Before i used to go to gas stations for car wash and vacuum but now i will go to this place.<//Text>

Probably the best car wash in the bay or near-bay area. Great results and reasonable price. My go-to place for monthly/bi-monthly car wash.</Text>

I wish I had taken photos, but it was inexpensive and came with a free car air freshener, a baggie for trash and dashboard wipe. Free vacuums after the wash. It was the longest automated car wash I've been too with lots of scrubbers, lights, and foamy soap! Car was really shiny and clean after (it had been caked in ash from the wildfires).<//Review>

<Review>Free vacuums and blowers!!! And they are powerful! The process was fast and easy and the end product was acceptable considering how very dirty my car was before getting washed the bit of dirt left on the rear of the car was fine as far as I'm concerned I could have paid double and had it hand washed but that wasnt needed.<//Review>< Pictures>

You can get your interior really clean with these professional strength features. I wont go anywhere else. The price a fair and they have package deals that make it even more affordable.

Had to get that layer of ash off my car. Great wash for the price. No waiting. Lots of space to dry and vacuum. Will return. *Bring a towel, they have high powered blowers but there were lots of drops to dry before they left spots.</text>

<text>Super fast, super clean drive through car wash. After going through the wash, there's a long row of covered parking spots equipped with vacuums and air blowers. The staff is always friendly and helpful. If you sign up for the monthly pass, there's a dedicated entrance lane. Highly recommend this carwash!<//text>< pics>

the best of both worlds!! Drive up to the gate, be greated  by friendly staff, select 1 of many drive thru washes. After the wash either leave the premises or choose parkIng under the shade of a canopy to use equipment for high pressure air And vacuum!
Friendly service, new, nice, clean, great 👍🏼 idea!

<Time>1580431428723<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Straight forward self service car wash. Car goes in dirty and comes out clean.  You'll need to do your own interior vacuum but they are provided at no cost. Probably worth bringing a small towel to spot dry some of the trickier spots. Even though they use distilled water for the final rinse (no spots), you'll still end up with a bit of clean water.

Pro Tip: Askk for a lollipop for any kids in th car.

Update: Not a fake review. The owner is my brother in law. We live in Pleasanton and he needed cars for testing prior to launch. I stand by my review. They opened on 12/16/19.<//Text>< pictures>

Great deal on a pair of shoes I wanted. They were half off what they were online. It was a clean and organized store.</Text>

I walked in for the first time during covid wearing a face shield because due to a medical condition, I cannot wear a face mask, and I have a medical exemption. I was told I could not shop there unless I wore a mask. This is called discrimination and is contrary to the American's Disability Act. The worker was uninformed. I have complied with a face covering for the protection of those around me. No other stores in Gilroy said anything to me as I completed.my errands tonight. I am doing my best to comply with the restrictions just like everybody else. Your employees need to be informed so that those with real disabilities don't get treated as though they are breaking laws.<//text>

If possible, I'd gladly give Reebok ZERO stars. I placed an order on the website a month ago to customize a pair of shoes (it writes it takes 3-4 weeks from design to delivery). Not only I cannot see any order history on the website, but I heard nothing back from Reebok. I just called them about its whereabouts, their representative told me the policy has changed and it will take around another month so suck it up. Her attitude  is more than arrogant and horrible. I really don't think I'll buy ANYTHING from Reebok EVER again.<//Review>

<Review>I’ve seen the 3 Dentist in the office and they were all great, easy to talk to, friendly and not pushy. The office is clean and I like that they have TV above the chair so you can watch Netflix while you get your teeth worked on. The dental hygienist that cleaned my teeth Monique (hope I got that correct) is awesome! She is so nice, easy going, barely felt her hands on my face while she cleaned it, walked me through the process and told me which area I need to brush more, and she is super nice and friendly! I love her, I will definitely ONLY schedule my cleaning with her.< /Review>< Rate>

I can't say enough good things about this office. From the friendly greeting right when I walked in, to how thorough and detailed my appointment was, everything in Dr. Lapiad's practice was outstanding. One thing I really appreciated was that I didn't feel like my appointment was rushed. The hygienist and Dr. Lapiad spent so much time explaining things to me and made sure I had a written treatment plan when I left. This was my first visit of many future visits to this office.  I'm brand new in town and after going to the same dentist for ten years, I was relieved to find such an awesome dentist and dental office so fast. Thank you, RiverPark Dental.</text>

<Text>I LOOOOOVE this place. I was so scared to go back to the dentist because of a previous, TERRIBLE experience at another place. They are all so nice & Dr. Lapiad is top tier in all aspects that include bedside manner , listening to the needs of her patients & being as thorough as possible. I don’t mind going to the dentist anymore thanks to Dr. Lapiad & RiverPark Dentistry!!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I was hesitant to change dental offices after so many years, but I'm glad I did!  Sometimes we get stuck in what's familiar while sacrificing quality of care.  The high tech/modern equipment is a huge plus.  And, the staff is friendly and highly efficient.</Review>< Rating>

<userid>111897495198324467263< /userid><text>I am really sad about this review. I loved this office and the staff was always great which makes this sad for me.

I had gone pre COVID and once my crown was put in I complained that the crown didn't feel right and that there was a gap.   I was told I would get use to it.  I was going to go back early 2020 regarding this crown but I cancelled due to COVID.

This year i went in to finally have her look at my crown again and I was told it was fine.   I then decided to go to two separate offices to get some second and third opinions. I was told that the crown was not done correctly because it  does not fully cover the vulnerable part of my tooth. I emailed this office and was told that they could replace it but I have to pay for the lab fee.  I am honestly disappointed in this and the fact that I had complained about it as soon as it was done and even recently.

Another red flag about this office is the pressure to do big procedures right then and there without even consulting insurance.  Again, I really liked this office and I am sad that I didn't see this sooner. I guess because I was comfortable and they are nice.

Just be aware,  and get second opinions.</text><Rate>1</Rate>< Name>

I highly recommend River Park dentistry and Dr. Lapiad!!! The whole staff was super nice and helpful. The place is super clean and super chic. They take your temperature when you come in and they have the floor marked following all the COVID precautions. My hygienist Ari was AMAZING she took her time and left my teeth’s spotless. I’ve gone to different dentist offices  and let me tell you they have never done a teeth cleaning the way they did it. I will definitely keep coming here.</Text>

<Text>This dentist office is very high tech and has installed many safeguards and use best practices and precautions during COVID. The staff is friendly, accommodating and informative. Dr. Pham who is a dentist who also cleans my teeth, observed that I had a receding gum line and took time to draw out what was happening to my tooth and what that meant for my future dental work. He also asked if I had ever considered Invisalign for my teeth saying that it would not only help cosmetically, but makes the teeth easier to clean as well. All procedures were presented as an option/suggestion without pressure to commitment. I have been going to this dentist for four years now for routine cleaning. I used to see Dr. Lapiad, but I have not seen her in the last three visits; she is very nice, but so is Dr. Pham.</Text>< name>

This was my first visit to Dr. Lapaid's office and I found her  and her staff to be very friendly and professional.  Dr. Lapiad's attention to detail was very impressive. She will be my Dentist moving forward. Linda Williams< /text>

<Review>I'm updating my review because I'm pretty disappointed with the recent work this office has done on my teeth. I had a cavity on the side of one of my teeth that Dr. Lapiad's staff pointed out needed to be filled. They filled it and it's fallen out twice. They repaired it both times, but mentioned that if it falls out again, I would need a crown. Well, it's starting to fall out again. I've had quite a few fillings done and have never had one fall out like this before, but I'm seeking out a new dentist for a second opinion.<//Review>< rate>

I'm a new patient here,  but I'm receiving dental care & services for almost 40 years from another dentist who recently retired. My newly found dental clinic are very professional, prompt and no wasting of any time in providing an excellent service. I can tell that all their staff are highly trained on their profession as their system & procedures are well explained. In an instant, I walked out with full understanding of my existing dental condition and works needed including coverages to maintain a good dental health. It was truly a blessing to find this dental clinic and would recommend to anyone.<//Text>

I had a great experience. My wife has been a patient for several years and she finally convinced me to switch over. I’m glad I did! The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. I was also blown away with how thorough they were.

And best of all....

YOU CAN WATCH NETFLIX FROM CEILING!

I started watching “Friends” and quickly realized that comedy isn’t the best option when someone is poking your teeth with sharp things.</review>

Called for a toothache. Was able to get in a few days later. Prior dental work was adjusted. Dr also noticed I had possible sinus issues and explained how that was related. Happy with the time to get in, adjustments done and recommendations on possible other health issues that can be causing it.<//Review>

They were friendly and accommodating. I asked if I could come in as soon as possible in the afternoon and ended up calling me rescheduling me quicker than originally since they now had the opening. It's a clean office and if you are into it, a screen over the chair so you can watch anything on Netflix while you are being worked on.<//text>

<Review>Dr. Lapiad and her staff were so welcoming from the moment we stepped into the office and through our whole visit. We took our 1.5 year old daughter there for her first dentist visit. It's nerve wracking for any parent and child to attend their first dentist appointment, but Dr. Lapiad and her staff made the visit so easy and as tear-free as possible. Everything that was done was explained so clearly and made us feel comfortable as parents knowing we were in very good hands. We highly recommend Dr. Lapiad and her staff at RiverPark Dentistry!</Review>< Pictures>

I really like Dr Lapiad, you're getting quality care with her.. but it's really expensive, even with insurance. There's no alternatives in treatment plans and what you're being quoted is it. No payment plans available, they have you finance with CareCredit. Great care but too expensive to stay on as a patient.< /review>

Great well kept facility. They have headphones and a tv on the ceiling so you can watch Netflix while they perform their services. They also explained everything very well from what work I needed done to what type of floss I should buy. I think what gives this place a five star vs a four is that the main dentist there is very humble and doesn’t treat her staff as subordinates. They chemistry and mutual respect between their team was refreshing to be around!<//review>

I had a lot of work done at Dr. Lapiads office and it was great at first. They were all very friendly and provided great dental care. I probably went there 20 times, I was always on time. But this last time I was a few minutes late and the receptionist, Star, gave me a lot of attitude when I got there and when I left just because I was asking her about a bill I got from them. On top of that, this appointment I had was for the last of my many major procedures so they had a brand new dental assistant on what seemed like her first day of work trying to help. She made so many mistakes, she had to apologize 8 times in the first 10 minutes I was there. It was like they were using my last appointment for major work to train the newbie. I wonder why they didn't do that on the first appointment. Later, I tried calling several times and never got an answer. Then I called with a private number and they picked right up. Interesting how that happened. They should treat their patients a little better than that. I'll be going elsewhere for future dental work.<//review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I became a patient in March 2019 when I relocated to Ventura County from  the Palm Springs area; and was immediately struck at the thoroughness of the services and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff.  I was there for my annual cleaning, checkup and xrays.  My second teeth cleaning was just last Friday and Tina tended to me on that occasion. Again, I was really impressed by the thoroughness and quality of service and by her friendliness.  I was heartbroken at having to leave my longtime dental office in the desert, not knowing if I would be able to find a dental office that would equal the quality, etc. to which I had become accustomed. Happily, I have found such a dental office with RiverPark Dentristy.<//review>< Time>

I used to hate going to the Dentist before I found Riverpark Dentistry.  They are much gentler then my old dentists and they are all so very friendly.  They also have a TV with Netflix above you so you can stay entertained and get your mind off the drilling and scraping lol.  The time always seems to go by very fast.  Thank you for the amazing service and care!</Text>

<Text>By far the best dental or even healthcare experience I have had. They really know how to hire. It's the most professional, competent, and thoughtful healthcare team I have seen in action. On top of that the office and rooms are pristine and modern. They are extreemly thorough and transparent throughout the entire experience. The way things should be.

Honestly, the only question you should be asking yourself right now is why am I not going to Riverpark Dentistry? The next question you will ask after you have been is, Why didn't I go sooner? That is the question I asked myself once I realized I had been living in the dark ages by going to the same dental practice I had been since I was a child. It was like going from horse and buggy to an automobile.

On top of that, the old practice I went to used ancient x-ray technology. I always cringed when I had to get x-rays because it's not comforting when your hygienist has to jump in a cement bunker to take an x-ray.  You know you are being irradiated. Riverpark Dentistry uses modern x-ray tech which will not take months off your life.

Give yourself and your health this gift and go to Riverpark Dentistry.<//Text>< Pictures>

Very professional staff. I was looking for a new dentist after moving to the area and I'm glad I found them. I love the fact that I can basically get any kind of dental work done all in one location. The only issue is the fact that since they are so great, it's a bit hard to get appointments at convenient times.< /text>

Star greeted me warmly with a friendly smile and offered coffee or water when I walked in. Tina had such a gentle touch when she cleaned my teeth-and her sweet and fun personality made any nervousness I had disappear. Dr. Lapiad's exam was the most thorough and informative I've ever had...she offered explanations-and solutions-for problems I have with my teeth that I never knew about! I highly recommend RiverPark Denistry-especially for anyone who dreads going to the dentist like me!</Text>< Pics>

<text>Love this Dentist.
Who likes going to the dentist? You will.
I'll be the first to admit I didn't go to the dentist as much as I should have, but going to Riverpark Dentistry is the best experience I've had in a Dentist's Office.
Staff is friendly. Office is clean and they do great work. What more could you ask for?
Oh you wanna watch Netflix while your there?
You can do that too!< /text>< Rating>

My Dentist of 20 years retired and i had a toothache from not see a dentist for over a year. I was able to get in to see the doctor right away. Dr. Lapiad  is so professional and knowledgable. I didnt have to wait in the chair long she came in right away. Her staff is sooo sweet and very experienced they explained everything thoroughly.  Their costs are very fair and they don't try to upsell unnecessary procedures.  I want to Express this because my husband went to another dentist a week prior to my visit with Dr. Lapiad with the same problem as me and his experience has been terrible. We will be switching him to Dr. Lapiad. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. LAPIAD/RIVERPARK DENISTRY. I just can't Express how happy I am to have found a great  dentist after my dentist of 20 years retired. Thank you, Dr. Lapiad for your professionalism and honest business values and care for your patients well being!  Jackie Flores/Oxnard< /text>

<Review>I have been Dr. Lapiad patient for more than 4 years. I have to say that I don't like Doctors and Dentists in general, I think they see their patients as $ and consider them not bright enough to explain procedures!. So to be my health professional, I have to see that they care about my well being first and foremost. There are exceptions and Dr. Lapiad is one of the best exceptions. I can see from her work that she loves to be a dentist and takes her Oat very seriously and cares about me. She works much harder than others just to make my dental experience a pleasant one. She has a great personality and always welcoming. I can write pages about her ..... but If we had more Doctors and Dentist like her ... we would be in heaven. I do wish the best for her and her new office.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

If you call and the insurance may or may not be right, they will put you on hold for over 5 mins and then hang up on you. Do not call this dentist.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Shelby Padua Lapiad and Staffs are very friendly, kind and always smiling. Very knowledgeable in any dental care. My family don't have any problem at all with our dental needs: routine cleaning, our crowns, fillings, my partial, etc. We are really very happy with the services we receive.

Clinic has modern dental equipments with scenic view. Enjoy free coffee, water, wifi, movie or music of your choice. No long waiting.

Dr. S.P. Lapiad is very approachable and highly recommended  by everyone.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>Love Dr Lapiad!!! Very thorough explaining of the whole process. Very professional and friendly staff. I'm always received pleasantly by Star and Pureza.
I take my whole family there. They are always accomodating with appointments.
I wish I would have found her office sooner. Previous dentist wanted to do a root canal on me. Nothing ever mentioned by Dr. Lapiad besides some filings and a partial on a back tooth that was broken.
I always feel at ease. The office if beautiful, clean and state of the art. I'm always offered wether I'd like to watch a movie or hear music.</review><time>1455826193142< /time>< rating>

Parts never came. I gave a few weeks for them to get things shipped or at least let me know what was going on. Can't get anyone over there to answer the phone. No confirmation of shipping. No contact. After reading other reviews here and at the BBB website, I went through my credit card and started the process of reversing the charge. Pain in the backside.<//Text>

<text>I ordered a 1969 c10 grille for my truck in November 2020. I called and called and called then finally in March I got a grille in but it was to a gmc truck not a Chevy which I ordered. It’s now June 2021 and still have not got my grille I ordered.< /text>< resp>

<Review>I ordered a fuel tank kit on 23 Dec 2020 and got confirmation of my order the next day and funds had been charged to my bank account. Several weeks passed and no shipment email follow up, I thought due to the holidays and C-19 I would have a longer than normal wait.  I reached out to RPS via their phone; however, no luck, the line was down. I was able to find the company via EBay and sent a message stating I could not reach their customer service via phone.  I received a nice reply from them saying their lines were down due to construction being completed in their area. I mentioned my issue and within a week I received the majority of my order less the fuel tank.  They stated the fuel tank would be shipped directly from the mfg.  I waited a few more weeks and no follow up email with shipping details from them about when the fuel tank would be shipped.  Again I tried via eBay and their customer service line, no luck.  I fear I will never see the tank.  I recently read a review from an individual who’s waited over a year for his order, and I wish I read his post prior to placing mine.
RPS, I ask for a little decency in regards to a reply to my order.  If you are able to resolve my tank dilemma with the mfg, I will be happy to change the amount of stars I am leaving your business.</Review><gmapID>0x808f91250df604f5:0xef1ef4eb67a9ba4a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I ordered reproduction speaker grilles for the rear shelf of my 65 Galaxie from RPS, I got them just a few days later. Tony at RPS is a joy to work with and has been able to provide me with top quality reproduction parts at a very good price, give them a call!< /Review>

I bought a whole mustang door frame assembly. It took a few extra weeks because frieght is moving so slow right now. Tony was very helpful. Even arranged for me to pick up my part on will call. Saving me $250 shipping cost. I had no issues buying this really expensive part from Restoration Parts source. I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again.< /Text>

Thank you sir for my parts and with covid-19 things must make it that more difficult on shipping and getting things readaly available to those who want it like yesterday.

there should be a ZERO STAR provision for this outfit. absolute thieves and it pains me to have to say that. ordered $272 worth of parts on 4-18-2021...they wacked my CC on the 23rd....never shipped. they do NOT answer the phone...voicemail is full...sent total of EIGHT emails asking for tracking and shipping confirmation. no response. if you want to get scammed out of a substantial amount of money, this is the place to do it at. i will never ever deal with these crooks again. ever!<//Text>

They told me that it was backed ordered and that they will have it possibly until July. I placed the order back in February 1st. and their website said that they had it in stock. I am very disappointed on the unprofessionalism of this mediocre company and the way they handle the situation just telling me week after week that the trunk lid was shipped to me.

<Text>Well 1 star is more than they are worth. I wish I would have read reviews before I ordered. Because they are all correct. I ordered headlight bezel for my 66 mustang . They took my money with no problem. They said would send me a email when it shipped with a tracking number . It’s been a month now haven’t received my parts or email. I have tried calling but all you get is mail box is full. Tried sending email to customer service no response from anyone.

<Review>Placed my order for 2 shock mounts on 11/19/20 and they immediately charged my card.  After 4 weeks, parts never showed up, called last week and were told that they were on the way.  When they hadn't shown up by today I called and spoke with the owner Tony and read him several 1 star reviews with  similar stories of 4+ week delivery times.  He issue a refund and now I start over.</Review></record>

I have ordered many parts from RPS for my 65 mustang build.  I have never had any issues with any of the parts I have received.  Living in Alaska,  that really helps when you have to pay shipping.  Plus they were able to work with me on shipping to a company in Washington where a family friend works who ships to Alaska.  Will always come back here for parts.
After reading the reviews,  all my parts were ordered last year,  it seems there must have been a changing of the guard there,  because the reviews seem to be pretty bad over the past few months.<//Text>

<text>I ordered a part from Restoration Parts Source which said at the time of ordering that it was in stock. I did not receive the order so I tried to call numerous times and emailed this company which they would never respond to. After calling constantly for over a week I reached a person (who said they were the owner) who had no idea what the status of the order was so I requested a refund and procured the part elsewhere. It has been over a month and a half since I requested a refund and Restoration Parts Source will not refund anything and they will also not answer any emails or phone calls. I have filed a complaint with the department of customer affairs for CA and disputed the claim with my bank but still haven't received a refund. Do not order anything from this company. I do not believe this company is even a legitimate business.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

No customer service. I ordered and paid for my part on the 5th, they took the money out of my account on the 7th. They have not sent tracking info, do not respond to emails, and  calls go to voicemail which is full.  I hated to give them 1 star as its not deserved.<//Text>

I don't even want to leave one star, they are that bad. The company is a joke.  I spent $228.95 on a 66" Mustang luggage rack that evidently was not in stock.  They don't respond to emails or phone calls, when I finally got a hold of someone who said he would refund my Paypal account a week ago nothing ever happened.
Buyer beware.. stay away from this company.  Contacting Better Business Bureau now. thanks, Jack< /review>

I will never order parts from this place again, they don't respond to my emails nor voicemails. They are fast to take your money, but Not send  parts out. Its been 43 days since they debited my account and I still have not received any updates on my order.

I'm currently a costumer, I've been waiting about a month for my stuff. I spent over $100 that I'm afraid of that I might not see again. I should of read the reviews like others have said in yelp or google reviews. I'll change my review if I get my money back but in the time being I'll leave bad reviews to warn others or give them hope of maybe seeing their money back months from now. Oh yeah no call back or ability to leave a message(just try their company number all you get is a robotic voice saying “mail box is full”), no email, or communication after they have taken your money(which they take your money almost immediately for processing).<//review>

<Text>Well after waiting a month to receive my owners manual for my 1973 Mustang and not being able to get ahold of ANYONE, I decided to leave a review.

Transaction was easy, I got a confirmation email, but have yet to receive any shipping update and my order never showed up. ITS BEEN A MONTH!

Pretty sure this is a scam.

If someone could get back to me I appreciate it. Otherwise I’ll assume that I’ll never see my owners manual or the $17.00 reimbursement for it. Pretty sad.</Text>< pics>

Not sure why this gentleman gets all the bad reviews. I ordered my parts for my 85 vette. Yes he doesn't send emails, not on top of everything as you may think,  but he is. I got my parts, took a little longer but his prices are really good. Just hang in there, you will get your parts.<//review>

<Text>Ordered hubcaps for my 65 Mustang and they came without out the center hub, even though it was shown on the picture. Called RPS and Tony answered, looked at the issue and resolved it immediately. Shipping the missing parts FREE and it was not the problem from RPS. Fast service and will definitely use them in the future for parts that I may need.</Text>< Name>

Well .......... I will say this ........ I’m editing my original review from a few months ago that was extremely negative and I even upped it one additional star. Because after  5 months ..... yes 5 months and several phone call attempts later, I finally received the order I placed back in June 2020 ...... it is now nearly Thanksgiving. It was a very stressful ordeal of thinking I had been took for a $170 & would NEVER receive anything at all to the point that I had even rebought the exact same item from another source (which I received in just 5 days btw). But nonetheless I did receive what I had ordered FINALLY! This is a true true story of events, I now have 2 sets & spent twice has much has I should have. I won’t order from RPS again & don’t recommend u do either.<//text>

<date>1558125145083</date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Read a lot of negative reviews and was skeptical. Since I live near by, I drove to his shop to visit. First impression, Tony runs a very busy and lean organization, I can understand why some people may have had trouble getting through on the phone. I found Tony to by extremely knowledgeable, courteous, and non-stop-hard-working. We talked about what parts I needed, he checked warehouse availability and said he would be placing an order in about a week or so. I was in no hurry for the parts and in about a week or so, the parts were in and I picked them up. He does stock some parts but is not a warehouse of every part in the catalog, just to be clear. He seems to order parts for his customers when he has enough to minimize the shipping cost to his shop. That means cost savings to his customers. If you don't need your parts over-night and would like to save money on your project, RPS is the right place to get your parts. I would suggest to ask about availability before you order to avoid back order issues. If you need your parts in a hurry, ask before you place your order. I will be a return customer.</Review>< Pictures>

Don`t waste your time or money with this site, the prices are so good because he delivers nothing. I should have read the reviews before I wasted my money trying to buy a part here. Everyone has the same tale to tell, your money is promptly taken and then the weeks will roll by as you wait for your item that never comes. You can try and call and email but you are just talking to yourself. Now as countless others have stated I too have started a transaction dispute to get my money back. You have been warned, stay away or take the "Buggy-Ride".<//Text>

Ordered a radiator that the website said fit my car. Radiator came and did not fit. Contacted Rps and was told I would recieve a full refund. I sent radiator back and have yet to reciev my money back. They dont answer the phone. Mailbox full and have never responded to my emails. Thankfully I paid with pay pal and hope to see my money in 30 days. This company is the worst I have felt with in all my experience buying parts on line.... I would not reccomend you purchase from here.</text>

I have to say my experience was on point and perfect! I needed vent window for our late brothers high school 65 mustang fastback which we have owned since 86!,our plan was to start the restoration for Dave's 50th bday and it went perfectly,it was the surprise of his life! Sadly we lost him 3 months later .so now 2 years later his bday is coming up 4/25/2020 and thanks to RPS we have our final piece to the restoration puzzle! Took 4 days to arrive and that was with Easter Sunday involved! Forever grateful and would recommend for sure! Thank you RPS FOR MAKING IT HAPPEN!<//Text>

Submitted an order  a couple weeks ago and it hasn't arrived. I called to find out the status of my order and nobody answers the phone and the voice mailbox are full. No response to emails either.  Calling my credit card company to reverse the charges. Another source for parts bites the dust.<//review>

Scammers. Zero stars. I ordered one little part that was "in stock" one month ago, for $45, never received tracking number, so after 3 weeks I started emailing and calling them daily, for no responses. Still no part, still no tracking, still no response. Thieves. They'll gladly steal your money.< /Text>

Should have looked at reviews before ordering.  Order part on August 16.  Never showed up.  Called on August 28, spoke with owner said he had to call manufacturer and would get back to me.  Never called back.  Called on September 5 and he said he had talked to the manufacturer and that I should get the part no later than end of following week.  Didn't get it as promised.  Called and got voicemail, told him to call me.  No call back.  Just disputed charge.< /Review>

Called and talked to Tony (owner) 2 times - first time was to remind him to ship what I ordered since a couple weeks had passed.  Wrong part came as it was described incorrectly on the website-which he realized. He was pleasant and offered full refund on the first call.  No refund. Tried another call but was "disconnected'. 3 emails all unanswered.  I wish him well in his business, but it will not involve me.  Too bad since there are a few other things (much more expensive than above) that I need.</review>

<text>I am in  CO restoring a '63 Ranchero, and needed a gas tank and sending unit. RPS was one of the only places I found selling a complete kit (tank, filler neck and gaskets, sending unit, lock ring) and for a better price than anywhere else I found. I had some concerns based on all the negative reviews, which mostly seem related to the time to fulfill orders. I called first, not expecting an answer based on the reviews, but Tony (I assume it was Tony) answered the first call, and explained the part ships direct from the manufacturer and would ship the next business day.  I ordered it that day on the RPS website, and sure enough Monday I got a notice it had shipped. It arrived shortly after, and was the exact part I needed and expected, but the lock ring for the tank seemed to be missing. Again I called RPS (on a Saturday) and my call was answered on the first try. Tony explained that this manufacturer often tapes rings and gaskets inside boxes. Sure enough the lock ring and an extra gasket were taped on the underside of the bottom inside flap of the box, making it very hard to find unless you disassemble the box; probably would have never found it and thrown the box out with the ring if Tony didnt know that this particular manufacturer did that. I really am surprised by the negative comments as my experience was great, and I'll use RPS again for other hard to find parts.  It seems as one other commenter said this is a specialty operation and can take longer at times, but if you are not expecting Amazon-like fulfillment times I'd recommend RPS to anyone based on my experience< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f91250df604f5:0xef1ef4eb67a9ba4a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They ignored me after taking my money. This is my first time submitting a review. I have had bad experiences with other companies but never enough to write a poor review. But it might keep you from wasting your time. I ordered door strikers for my Falcon on 9/22/19. I track all of my stuff. So I looked for tracking information on 9/25. There is no order status on the website. I couldnt care less even if they were back ordered. But I wanted to know what was going on, regardless. So I emailed them on 9/25. No reply. Emailed on 9/28. No reply. Called on 9/28. Was told they were in stock and they would ship them out that day. I called today 10/8/19. Was told they are not in stock and they should be in stock in a day or 2. I told them to cancel the order. He said he would need my credit card information over the phone. I wasn't  comfortable doing that. Just disputed the  charge with my credit card company. All I wanted was a reply to my  email. I was going to order a bunch of stuff if this order went through okay. I'll give my business to a company that replies when emailed, instead. I dont even need the parts right away . But I hate being ignored.</review>

<Review>Ordered part, took almost a month to receive, it was damaged, asked for an exchange over the phone and via email. Was assured I'd get one. Called again after a couple of weeks with same response. A couple of more weeks have passed and no part to date, nor have I received a call or email with a status. Called VISA to dispute. Tony is either overwhelmed or he doesn't care about his company's reputation or growth prospects.</Review>< pics>

If I could rate with negative stars, I would.  I believe any positive reviews here are the work of friends and business  associates.  Five weeks to get my order. After my phone calls got no results I had my VISA card rep call and it took two calls from her to get action and then the parts were drop shipped.<//Text>

<review>Ordered parts for my 67 mustang. Got half and the rest was back ordered. Emailed them and no response so I called. He said they would send it out and months went by. Called again and said the same thing. It’s been well over a year and NOTHING! With I read the other reviews before I ordered through these unprofessional thieves . Do not use them!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

As others have said, do not order from this place. Took a full month to get a part they said was in stock, and that was after three calls and one email that has still never been returned. Buy from somewhere else.<//Review>

This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. I order a cowl vent repair kit for my 1966 Mustang. They had no problem taking my money, but when it comes to giving me any little bit of information for shipping or returning my emails it’s impossible. I have yet to recieve my parts. I will NEVER do business with this “business” again. Avoid with all cost.</text>

STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF. Miserable customer service. I ordered a part and my credit card was charged on 8/6/18. I had heard NOTHING so I emailed them on 9/1/18. No reply. I called on 9/6/18 and someone answered. they said they would call me back with the shipping info. No call back. I called again on 9/13/18 and they said the supplier hadnt delivered the part yet and they would call them and call me back. No reply. I called on 9/24/18 and no one answers now. I am filing a complaint with the better business bureau and disputing the charge with my credit card company. THEY ARE THIEVES.<//Text>

I ordered a 1970 Cuda radiator support and did not get any follow up information.  I called and was told the item would ship from PA and they would get back to me with the shipping date.  I never received a follow up call and all future calls from me went directly to voice mail.  I left my name and number but didn't get any response.  I replied to e-mail traffic looking for updates and no response there either.  I requested a refund and will seek remedy from Paypal if they continue to be unresponsive to my simple requests.</Review>

Will never order from them again.  They listed the part in stock but it wasn't.  It was being shipped from manufacturer. It took a week to get the order to the manufacturer then another week to get part. When I called customer service they said yeah that happens...jerks!< /Text>

Not real happy right now. Ordered two fuel pump bolts on a Wednesday. The following Wednesday I get a notice that they are just now shipping it Via the Postal Service.  The parts were four dollars, they charge me six dollars for shipping! I guess I got screwed. Shame on me!!!</review>

< Review>
I ordered a fuel tank sending unit from RPS for my 66 Galaxie. The price was half of what the other resto suppliers were charging, so I thought I’d try it. I ordered on a Monday and read some of the reviews the next day about not receiving products or refunds and at that point I assume I get screwed. Anyway I got an email with the tracking number on Friday and the part arrived the following Monday. The order was processed in a timely manner, arrived quickly, and was of good quality at a great price. My gas gauge now reads as it should. I don’t know exactly what happened with the people who posted bad reviews, but I’m satisfied. I would recommend this company, and will be ordering from Tony again.</Review>

Ordered dust shields a year ago. Call him every 4 months and he always says he will call back and never does. Never got my money back or parts. Beware!! Stay away!! I gave him a year before I wrote this which was plenty of time to do the right thing but kept giving me the run around.<//text>

Called and ordered a mustang complete floor (dynacorn).  I was skeptical due to the reviews online and the bbb rating.  Spoke to Tony and expressed my concerns.  After a 5 minute conversation, and the $200 savings over cj pony parts, I decided to place the order.  Ordered Tuesday late, so it most likely processed Wednesday.  Floor arrived Friday.  Couldn't be happier.  Customer service was excellent.  I will definitely be checking their site when ordering for my other restoration needs.  Thanks again Tony.< /review>

They had no problem pulling money out of my account, 12 days and still no response with a tracking number, just a useless invoice that provides me with nothing. Multiple emails with no response, I will be calling tomorrow for a refund. Go elsewhere.< /Review>

Im a bit worried, because the part hasnt even gotten to their warehouse and yet when I ordered they said it should be in the next tuesday or Wednesday.  I will look for a way to get a refund which I know will be like pulling teeth.

This business is not professional at all they do not answer there phones. Yeah it says 9-5 but no answer and no call backs and whats even worse is when you email them they do not email you back. It sounds like they just like to take people's money which really sucks.< /Review>

If you want to get good prices on a wide variety of very nice items for your home, you better hurry! The dtore is going out of business and there are markdowns of 25 to 50 %,, and they're selling everything, including all the fixtures and store equipment. They told us September 20, 2020 will be their last day.  So sorry to see them go!</text>

I can see why they are going out of business.   They should have stuck with their staple items - candles, Papasans and nice kitchenware.<//Review>

If all their stores are like this one it is easy to see why sales are struggling. The atmosphere was not inviting at all. We were not greeted until we had already been in the store for 30 min. The store was freezing cold. No music playing. No inviting smells. No warmth at all in a store that should be cozy and welcoming.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very sophisticated furniture store, a lot of things. However, the price is also a little expensive.

很精致的家具店，很多成套的东西。不过价格也有点小贵。< /text>

It you are looking for that southern comfort feel in So-Cal then come to Lenny's. The ribs are out of this world and mac and cheese is to die for. They make bananas foster at the table for you and you MUST try the opera cake. Most of the serving staff is professional singers who can sing a happy birthday to knock your socks off. The head manager Crystal is a sweet as the they come and the decor is southern roadhouse met with California style. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner you will not regret a meal at Lenny's.<//text>

Great comfort food - ribs, burgers, pulled pork mac and cheese sandwich. All great tasting. Service can be a bit slow and they've lost their liquor license. But still enjoy the food.</review>

BEWARE. STAY AWAY.
Went for lunch after hiking around the Chatsworth reservoir. Parking lot was busy, but inside didn't seem to busy. The wait staff seemed like they were not use to being that busy. Was only able to give us 2 menus for a party of 4. Had to order our drinks twice. I received my wedge salad (which was the best thing on the menu) with the rest of my meal. What really made the whole meal unbearable was the fact that the whole time eating owner/managers kids where running around like it was there personal playground, If I was at McDonald's then I could understand. Waitress said she couldn't do anything about it. Food was alright, the atmosphere with the kids ruined the whole meal. Never going back.</text>

Outstanding barbecue! It's mouthwatering from the moment you pull up since Lenny's out front manning the pit by the door. The waitstaff did an excellent job, including an operatic rendition of Happy Birthday. The portions are big and satisfying, but try to save some room for desert. The blueberry cobbler was excellent.< /text>

Lenny's is a hideaway off the beaten path where you will be served some of the best barbecue and smoked meats that you've ever had in your life! I recommend the rib-eye steak for your first time. Lennys has a small town country feel and is rarely crowded although we've never been there on Friday or Saturday nights when the live music shows up. Prices are very reasonable too.< /Text>

Really great food that carries it to a 3 star by itself. Honestly if they were able to serve alcohol or have it even be BYOB this would easily add an extra star. The wait staff was kind to us, something that is always appreciated.</review>

Went there on my birthday, server was told of that but she didn't acknowledge. The Whisky ribs were a bit too peppery for us. My mother mentioned that to our server, a red haired girl who rudely replied "Well, that's barbecue!" Gonna stick with the better and more reasonably priced and friendlier Stone Fire Grill. Won't be returning to lenny's, ever.</review>

I've heard about this BRBQ place and finally checked it out. Ordered a whisky glazed full rack of ribs with nice Mashed Taters. The Baby Back rib pork was lean, tasty and fell off the bone. Unlike other ribs I've had these were really meaty with a good smoke flavor. Even though I'm a big guy, that full slab was three meals for me. That's how good the portions are here at Lenny's! YES, I'll be back!</review>

I ordered to go beacuse I live just up the road and i decided to pair this with a hard cider and let me tell you what it makes a fantastic combination, but I digress. Everyone needs to come and try some of lennys food.

Lenny this is the best bbq I've had in a long time, I will definitely be back for more.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Best place in the area to find barbecued ribs, with the possible exception of my friend Peter's backyard. Check out weekend brunch too. If you let them know a day ahead to smoke the salmon they'll make you a mean-ass lox Benedict.< /review><GmapID>0x80c29d231b11bf33:0xf45ae26327e9a830</GmapID>< rate>

<review>Outstanding service and ribs. Corn muffins are excellent with a little jalepeno for kick. Bread pudding is the best, but you have to tell them to save it for you when you first walk in because they run out of it fast.< /review>< rating>

<review>The food is bland and soggy and everything is watered down. It seems to me that the servers don’t wash their hands. They have a “pet” mouse running on a wooden beam by the entrance. It has rumored that there has been maggots in the mashed potatoes. Flies are in the kitchen and in the dining area. Servers are absolutely rude and the waiting time is very long even though the place isn’t that full of people. Not recommended even to your worst enemy.<//review>< username>

Food is amazing, it was a little warm inside. Would be great if they added a kids menu, although my 8 year old daughter thought the half rack was one of the best meals of her life.</Review>

WOW..... So this just hapened. This has to be the WORST dining experience I have ever had. Normally when we eat here we see Lenny walking around or hanging out. He has never just randomly come over to his tables and introduced himself or asked how we are. Tonight was different. We ordered a full rack of ribs (to share). We split 1/2 smoked whiskey and half smoked raspberry and ordered an extra mashed potatoes. Our food comes and I was not impressed. I ask my mom how her ribs are.. She told me that she thought that they were "stringy and a bit tough". I then said to her. "I don't like mine either". The ribs are not easy to bite and I felt they were tough and stringy as well. We both agreed that the mashed potatoes were good. We called over our server and let him know that we were not happy with the food and could we please get something else. I sat and watched as he let Lenny know. Lenny shook his head no and then waived the young kid off. A few minutes later Lenny comes out of the kitchen holding our plates. He sets one in front of me and one in front of my mom. He very nicely let us know that he personally tried the ribs and that "there is nothing wrong with them." He let us know that they actually were "more tender than usual." He explained his smoking process (I, as a chef am well aware but was polite and let him continue). So my mother said... "So you are trying to tell us that you aren't going to let us get something else?" I knew that the minute he put our food back on the table in front of us.  Lenny told us that "if there was something wrong with the food" he would be "happy to replace" it. However the ribs are just the way they always are served. He said to us "I can take 20% off your bill if that helps". WOW... "helps what" is what I wanted to say. I told him "it's not a financial issue it's an issue that we don't like the ribs and neither of us are happy." Lenny just reiterated that the ribs are the way they should be. I told him that I respect his decision but disagree with how he is handling the situation. I told him I understand as a chef and business owner but sometimes you need to take one for the team to make the customer happy as opposed to losing business. He just looked at me. I said, "well I won't be eating this can I have our check" my mother asked for the food to be boxed up since she was paying for it anyway. Me personally.. I was fine to leave it on the table. Now mind you... The restaurant is completely empty except for a man who had just walked in before Lenny came to our table to give us back our food. As Lenny walked away I looked at the man who had watched and listened to the entire exchange. He has his mouth gaping and shook his head. Got up from his table and walked out. YES HE LEFT. So.... We paid for this awful food and gave the server a $10 tip. He was as nice as can be. He told me several things but for fear that he may lose his job I won't put it on blast. I came home and made some eggs for dinner. I let Lenny know that we drove across the valley and would never be coming back. He had no reaction.  SHAME ON YOU LENNY... this is what happens when your EGO is more important than your guest's. Lenny should hang a sign on the door.. "If you don't like my food... LEAVE"<//text>

OMG - good food.    My first time at Lenny's Smokehouse and and I cannot say enough good things.  Our waitress made us bananas foster at our table....what a great dessert.   I had the breakfast quesadilla and it was HUGE and the best tasting breakfast item I have had in forever.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating...we were 10 minutes late for the breakfast hours but Lenny took care of us. Inside seating and the patio are both great.</Text>

<text>I'm usually not very picky, nor do I write many reviews but this place pissed me off.

The Good:
Excellent customer service
Friendly atmosphere
Very clean

The Bad:
The food that I had was old. I came here with a  couple friends and we ordered the Greek salad, whole chicken, chili, and a cheesecake for desert. This place is not cheap so we where expecting top of the line stuff. The Greek salad was OK at best. The chicken was not fresh and was obviously reheated. It was extremely dry and tough and even the waitress agreed. She charged us for a half chicken instead but that was unacceptable. Maybe it was because I came an hour before they closed. I do not go out to a restaurant and spend good money for reheated chicken. The meat in the chili was extremely dry and the cheesecake was small and very disappointing.

Overall I would probably never come here again due to the fact that they tried to serve me reheated chicken. I do not go to restaurants and pay good money for that crap. Do yourself a favor and do not come here.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Place is in a secluded area. Didn't know place existed until a friend took us. Nothing impressive, we were the only people in the building at lunch time. Tri-tip was dry and chewy.< /Text>

< Review>
Service is snail's pace, and consider yourself lucky if you get fresh meat. Beware of the chili, which is made with leftover meat so old most restaurants would throw it out. I've driven by there more than once when the BBQ was aflame 4 feet high, left unattended. I guess if it weren't for the high heat he cooks his food at, Lenny's would be a danger to public health.< /Review>

I want Lennys to be good so much, I would love to have a great bbq spot down the street from my house.

Unfortunately Lennys consistently disappoints. I've tried almost everything, and only the breakfast is even close to good.

Food literally takes forever to come out.

Recently had a C score from the county

Waitress is very nice< /Review>

Food was good.  Service was friendly, but they forgot about me.  I ended up being so bored of waiting for my check that I had to stand up to stretch my legs.  Disorganized.  They also use that app that tells you how much to pay for the tip, which is rude.<//Text>

My mom and I showed up today right around when they opened. We got to meet Lenny and he personally helped us figure out what food to order. Everyone who worked while we were there was incredibly kind and attentive. But I have to say, this is the best food I’ve ever had. Ever. Not just the best barbecue or smokehouse type food, I’m talking best food ever out of all the food I’ve ever eaten.
Everything was fresh, thoroughly seasoned and marinated, melt in your mouth insane how-the-hell-do-I-not-order-everything-on-the-menu good.

We ordered barbecue Cajun shrimp (came out on a skillet resting in a puddle of garlic and rosemary and who knows what else with lemon in the side and this toast that I’ll never forget), pulled pork Mac and cheese sandwich (shivers), tri tip (just made), green beans (probably my favorite part???), jalapeño bell pepper cornbread muffins with honey butter, charro beans, a half rack of baby back ribs, and churro cheesecake with ice cream.

All of this for under a hundred bucks. We also had drinks.

We will definitely be coming back to this slice of heaven soon! Probably gonna do some cardio for a week then head on over...trust me, you’re gonna be rolling out of Lenny’s.<//text>

One time only the sauce for the ribs was watery and no flavor. The mash potatoes had no flavor at all. The service was bad the young man that took the order didn't listen to the full order. The employees didn't wash their hands at all I watched two of them touch the hair and still served food other guest. I don't recommend this place at all.<//Review>

<Text>Ribs were fatty and lacked much meat. Waiter couldn't explain the menu choice of side orders. I was expecting a bean/rice type combo. As that is what the waiters said the Dirty RIce was . He brought me an order of boring Dirty rice and order of boring beans. They asked me on two occasions if I wanted my Dr.Pepper refilled ; they refilled it with ice tea. I was ticked off from the beginning as I reserved a table for six by the window which I described to the hostess when I made my reservation the day before. Instead they gave us a table far from the window ..the place was dark as they had all the window shutters drawn which didn't help their mistake.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><user>109150388420572792011<//user></record>

My wife and I went to Lenny's to celebrate our 24th anniversary.  Outstanding food, great decor, and friendly servers and employees.

The food is borderline upscale gourmet and the presentation is outstanding.  We got the Tres Quesadillas and they were presented with vibrant colored tortillas with sauces accenting the color for a feast of the eyes as well as mouth.

The house mop sauce is a tangy mustard based sauce that would be at home in Kansas City.  Think Gates.  But better.

All in all, a fantastic meal and a great night.  Thank you Lenny.<//text>

Service was going downhill. Seemed to be better, though it was Election Night and there was no one here. My order was wrong (raspberry ribs instead of whiskey ribs) but delicious so it didn't matter. Plus I got a full rack not the half.</review>

Extra $2.50 for mac and cheese (really) because it's "upgraded"  They cook some penne with cheese in a little skillet and charge $7.50 (about) for it.  Fries were served to us cold.  Seemed like they kept the ketchup in the freezer.  If you get two different flavors of ribs they just throw one on top of the other so all the sauce pretty much runs together and you can't tell which is which. The tritip was just ok.  The first piece I had was pretty much all fat and gristle.

Another table came in about 15m after we sat and ordered, and somehow their food arrived at the same time ours did.

Biggest fail: The actual meat really had no flavor.  I could taste the sauce, but when I actually bit into the meat the flavor just wasn't there.  I've tried quite a bit of BBQ over the years in various states.  This was marginal at best.

However, the biscuits, were great.

Would I go back? Probably not.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29d231b11bf33:0xf45ae26327e9a830</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Sometimes you walk into a business, and you expect everything to go well. Nothing could not be truer about Lenny's Smokehouse BBQ in Chatsworth.  As I pull into the parking lot and I am greeted by the pit-master, I just knew everything would be alright.

I walk in without a reservation, and Grace immediately greeted me.  I should have had a reservation and felt wrong as she drilled that point home.  "Table for 2," I say calmly, amid the stern reprimand.  "There is about a 20 minute wait, sir" she stated.  My friend and I take a seat. In about 20 minutes or so, when Grace came to seat us, she informed me that the only seating available was outside.  I was against sitting outside because it was chilly, and I was coming down with what later become a cold.  Note to self: do not drive from Los Angeles to Phoenix, then back to Chatsworth for dinner with the air conditioner blowing in your face.  I eventually relented and sat outside. To her credit, once an inside table was available, she moved us.

My waitress' name was Brandy. She started off attentive and friendly. The hiccup came when she informed me that Lenny's does not have cornbread. I am not sure I have ever had that happen, no cornbread at a BBQ joint? I ordered a mixed full rack of the Raspberry Ribs and the Whiskey glazed ribs, with a side of Smoked Red Beans.  The fruit reduction sauce let me know immediately that this would not be a traditional BBQ dinner, but did not lead on the the surprise that would come later.  Furthermore not having cornbread saddened me, but Brandy offered to bring dinner rolls in their stead; unfortunately she may have forgotten to bring them.

I am no BBQ rib expert or pit master, but I do know overcooked and under-cooked meat. The rack of ribs I received from Lenny were both.  No smoke ring, hard pull on the under-cooked ribs, easy pull and even bone-cracking on the overcooked ones.  I will not bother asking where the dry rub was because it certainly was not on the ribs; perhaps the words [cajun rub, and special rub] were just used as a colorful description to distract you from the hoity-toity raspberry reduction sauce.  Or maybe the they were Kansas City ribs?  You know drenched in sauce with little meat or rub flavor profile.  The ambiance, live music, and overall feel of the restaurant is Southern, more specifically Nashville or Memphis.  So it seems we have a Tennessee restaurant in Southern California serving Kansas City-style BBQ ribs, I suppose I can get with that. We all go through an identity crisis at one time or another, right?

Lenny's Smokehouse BBQ looks great, and feels even better.  The setting makes you feel right at home, a Tennessee home; unfortunately the ribs are Kansas City not Tennessee.< /review>

<Review>We've eaten here now three times.  I've had the killer quesadilla, whiskey ribs (tender, juicy), tri-tip (maybe best ever), pulled pork (piled high), tri-tip chili (big chunks of meat, smokey), mac 'n' cheese sandwich (fat free!  not!) , and the blueberry cobbler (OMG). We've never been disappointed in the quality AND quantity of the food.  We've always left with something to take home. When you go, leave room for some cobbler. No, seriously ... leave room for the cobbler! You'll thank me later.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c29d231b11bf33:0xf45ae26327e9a830</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It was fresh and warm. I had the sausage egg and cheese bagel. The best I've ever had. I will definitely keep going back there.< /Text>

If you need food fast, this is the place to go. Nevermind quality because they don't have any consistency. Some days their beans are burned others their taco shells are stale, there is never a time that everything is fresh and crisp. Fries are usually undercooked as well. Best option is their del Tacos...when they put enough cheese on them. 🤔<//text>

<Text>I receive excellent service today at this Del Taco from Dinette.
This Del taco is above average, the staff was friendly the dining room is clean and a lot of people seem to use it.
The food was fresh and as ordered.
Clearly a Del Taco doesn't compete with a steakhouse... But comparing this location to other Del Tacos, and other fast food options, they definitely stood out as clean, polite, and efficient.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7TBFo_5jhYC7UjFWSFE5TpM_5vSEDefPJNrmS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Ordered. Paid. Asked to wait up front. After 10 minutes, they bring the food. Didn’t seem fresh at all and a burrito was missing. Not the best but decent.</text>

After I placed my order, I drove to the window and the lady looked at me as if I was crazy and I told her what I had just ordered and she told me to go around and get back in line. Made no sense. I won't be going to this location.</review>

Got a piece of glove in my burger . They did it  purposely . Saw the lady who did it joking with a male employee. No one loses that big of piece of gloves and not notices or is curious as to where it went. Absolutely disgusting!!!<//review>

I only went because the line at wendy's was to long and I was on my break. Every Del taco I go to is stingy with there meat. Tacos are mostly lettuce and cheese. I don't recommend them if your looking for a good taco. You'll get disappointed.<//Text>

Best Del Taco I've been to in awhile. And I've sadly been to many. One employee who stood out the most to me was Breanna. She definitely knows how to be personable, friendly, and make you feel like you're not just another car, even at 1am! Definitely made my horrible night a lot better just from her customer service.

Thank you! I'll be back</text>

<Text>It's your typical fast food. Restaurant was clean and food was delivered fast and hot. Staff was curteous and didn't hate that they were there. Ordered the chicken soft tacos and never let's me down. Food was fast which is why we stopped here. Employees were friendly and polite. Food was good. Impressive Bathroom was really clean.  Burrito was really big. Del Taco on Frederick in Moreno Valley is an enjoyable place to grab a quick Mexican meal at a reasonable price. The manager Irene keeps a great group of employees who always care about their customers. While I lived in town, I used to get my lunches there 3-4 times a week, always being able to stay in my budget. I am very thankful for the pride Irene displays in her store, and that is why I come to her store.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<name>LisaMarie Eubanks</name><Text>An AWESOME place to go for a family Breakfast. The environment and the employees are so sweet and family Oriented. We go there because of the Manager Bree, she is so sweet and our grand daughter lives to see her and gives her big hugs. It's more of a family Oriented place, where everyone knows everyone. If you haven't gone to Del Taco on Moreno Beach St. Then you need to go. Great food, and great people's and great employees. Go and ask for Bree, AWESOMENESS!!< /Text>< time>

<text>Very very disappointed in the food.  I asked when I ordered for HOT fries and we got cold and old grease taste.  And my red burrito, I asked for extra red sauce, extra cheese and add sour cream.  So NO sauce at all, i small dot of sour cream and absolutely no extra cheese. Then we were ready to go and needed a small bag and my daughter stood at the counter and 3 employees just kept walking passed her and never asked if she needed something for about 5 minutes.  What happened to customer service.  I worked at a Del Taco and it was all about the customers and the freshness of the food that would keep coming back.  So sad!!<//text>< Name>

I like Del Taco, the food is very light to medium spicy. The french fries are good size. Their Taco Meat is nice their nachos are excellent. What really makes them especially good in our small town is it they're open all night. There's only a few places to go if you've got the late night munchies Del Tacos a good one.<//Text>

Edit: Normally Deltaco has not disappointed, but tonight they did. I ordered two separate meals, one order was done correctly, but the second order of Del Carbon Tacos were awful. Each taco shell was completely torn in half with all the meat falling out, the shells were stale, like they were microwaved too long. The chicken taste awful. I don't know who made them, but they should be ashamed of themselves. I will call them tomorrow and let them know about this, I want my money back. Customer service is still fantastic.< /text>< rate>

< Review>
Wow, they have really gone down hill. The 1/2 pound bean and cheese burritos the last 10 times we have gone have weighed at 5.25 oz through 7.02. Two days ago I felt no weight after getting my bag. The burritos were so small I sent them back. We had been waiting for ever in the drive thru. They took forever and I drove through. I asked my son the check them. They were so small again. Felt way below the 5.25oz. So I parked and went in. No manager!! I let them know there was no excuse and to bring out their scale. They didn't. They remade them. I got home and weighted them as 7.75oz and 8.1 oz. So at least normal range. It really bothers me because they keep getting smaller when a half pound is a half pound, and the price has gone from .99 to $1.19!!!!< /Review>

That's what I expect from a chain fast food restaurant consistency. Today the drive-in employee forgot about me and left me out there for a minute or two. Accidents happen! That's for sure, but it's the attention to details and the customer service experience that makes a difference. I've been to this restaurant before and I will probably go back I won't hold this against them. What can I say stuff happens?? I usually get the number 9 which is a Del beef burrito,Fry's and a orginal taco and a mr. Pibb. What's your favorite combination to order?</Review>< pics>

I walked into Del taco to place my order, and the person who took my order was Mr. Sergio, he has such an up beat personality and had a wonderful smile that made me feel good.  I normally order my food and go, but l decided to sit and eat my food there.  The tables and floor were clean and there was plenty of condiments.  My food was ready in no time so I sat down to eat and enjoyed the atmosphere which was quite nice inside.   I ordered the large del taco and a medium drink with a charro on the side, it was delicious.  Mr. Sergio thank you for making my day Pleasant with a wonderful smile and a great personality you are definitely a plus for the restaurant.  I Recommended this particular Del taco, its a Pleasant place to eat.   Walmart, Games stop, and other businesses are located in the same lot.  Plenty of parking and the parking lot is well lit at night.<//review>< pictures>

I had a major issue with coupons with del taco but this is the only one in the Moreno valley area that was willing to work with me. I really appreciate their help and I recommend this restaurant over the elder avenue location.< /Review>

Del taco is the best! Always open and food is usually really good. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and the dining area was very slow, but the drive-thru see very consistent with a steady stream of traffic. The food was good, not the best deltaco experience but average to above. I'll definitely be returning to this location.</review>

No matter how long the line is in the drive through, I always seem to get through super quick. Is the food the best? With any fast food it's always up in the air, and of course every location relatively stays the same, but I can say it's always good food, and they actually care to make their deluxe chilli cheese fries deluxe. Some places do a spurt of sour creme and the fries are dry, not here!< /text><Rate>4<//Rate><Resp>None</Resp><Time>1485722415463< /Time>< gmap_id>

It's not my problem your speaker doesn't work for the drive-thru. Don't ask me or tell me to back up. If I can hear you and you can hear me, press your stupid fast food button. I don't really care. Fix your garbage drive-thru system.<//Review>

< review>
Just went in on 2/4/18 at around 1:50am.  Staff is extremely rude and undertrained.  The employee taking orders not only forgot his headset was still on but he had the nerve to complain about there being customers and having to work.  After complaining for a bit he realized his headset was on and didn't even apologize for being so rude.  I didn't even order anything because they'll probably make it wrong.< /review>

<Text>Waited there for 10 minutes just waiting to order food. And the whole entire time I watched them fill orders they were so very disorganized. I really don't know who is in charge of that store. Also I was Charged an extra .40 cents for jalapeños and didn't get them. Yeah can't even get an order right and they want $15 an hour!</Text>< Pictures>

Stopped here to grab a bite on our way home from the casino and even though there was only one small family of three other than me and my bf they took forever and the employees were arguing and bickering with each other over ridiculous minor things and there was only one napkin dispenser that was hidden as far in the corner of the ordering counter and they didn't give or offer us any at anytime so after having to get our food I had to get back up and hunt down some napkins while an employee watched me with a dumb look on his face 🙄 Should've taken 5 minutes but took 45!</review>
