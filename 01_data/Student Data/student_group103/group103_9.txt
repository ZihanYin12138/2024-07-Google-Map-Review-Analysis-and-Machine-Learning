<rating>5<//rating><review>Cherie was an amazing person to go to and get my car fixed. She was knowledgeable and understanding about everything. She went above and beyond to make sure we were in not only in a driveable car but the safest it could be. I definitely will be coming back and seeing her again! She was the first person to not actually judge my car or situation and just made sure we were cared for! Thank you so much for being an amazing customer service and working on the car! 💕

P.sthank you to the team as well! I know it's not always easy but you are making people's lives better and safer!</review>< Pictures>

Chris D'Arcy and his team are professional and kept me apprised of items that will need future attention.  I was able to get my car repaired and they also let me know about manufacturer recalls that were applicable.  I highly recommend Kniesel.<//text>

<Text>This is still the best place in town to take your vehicle. I had difficulty finding a place that would install a cabin air filter (my truck did not come equipped to take a filter); not even the Dodge dealer would do it. Chris made a special trip to make sure I got the right parts AND set it up on short notice. I bring the truck here for regular servicing, and am always happy that I do.</Text>< Pictures>

Very nice. On time. I had ordered wheels and tires from an online site and Kniesel’s Auto Services scheduled me an appointment upon delivery immediately. Very nice and caring. Only issue I had was after installation the wheels and tires were very dirty and they didn’t clean them so I had to spend an hour cleaning them but I think they had just accidentally forgot. Overall recommend this shop.<//Text>

<Review>Outstanding place to do business. As a woman when something goes wrong with my car I panic. This morning my battery was dead from parking lights being on since Saturday. Having my car for 5 years I knew it was time to replace the battery. I called around and got numerous prices. I was headed to another establishment when I remembered going into Kniesels once for air in a tire and they were wonderful. I dropped in to be greated by Cherie. She was very professional, quoted a better price for a longer warranty and got me in right away. Less then an hour later I was on my way. Very happy customer, and if I ever need my car serviced I will go here first.</Review></record></dataset><record>

My A/C problem was a huge one for me, and you took care of everything in a timely manner and got me on the road. I appreciated the shuttle to my home.

I went in to get an oil change for my bmw 4 series. I was quoted $120 on the phone, i get there i’m quoted $175 i ask why and they say because my car uses synthetic oil, which is obvious but that wasn't mentioned on my call. Not only that but they used the cheapest possible synthetic oil 0w-30 and they tell me that my car only takes 0w-30. They pretty much lied to my face. I have done oil changes before but i didnt have my lift this time around, so i wasnt able to do it and I know for a fact that this car doesn’t ONLY take 0w-30 synthetic but of course thats what i’m told anyways. So anyways fast forward they change my oil with the filter i provided its all good. But then they don’t even reset my maintenance light for the oil, telling me that the mechanics have to “google it”. Because they apparently don’t know how. They also fail to check my car battery and cabin air filters services that are included with my oil change claiming that it was too hard to access for the mechanics. Absolute joke over charged me on a simple 10 minute oil change and couldn’t reset maintenance light or check my cabin air filter or battery. Last time ever coming here.<//review>

<Name>Patti Howell< /Name><time>1588397873007</time><rate>5< /rate><Text>My car died on Sunday and I had to have it jumped to get home. Later this week I called Kniesel’s. I spoke with Chris who was, as always patient with my questions and willing to answer. He said it was best to have my car towed in so they can determine if the alternator is having issues. Once my car was fixed Chris called to tell me I only had a dead cell in my battery and they took care of replacing it and resetting the computer in my car. They also sent an Uber driver to bring me to get my car. I conveniently paid online and Chris met me in the parking lot with my key. All the staff at this Kniesel’s are a pleasure to interact with and I trust them to take care of my car needs.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Took my scion into this scam of a place, heard they were honest, trustworthy, and fair priced, what a lie that was. I let them do a full diagnosis of the car seems like they were thorough got update and a final review at the end. Some of my issues were very minor and normal wear and tear.
Turns out I needed new spark plugs and a engine coils 500 bucks later car is having issues called to see what was going on, got told they only changed one coil and to change the broken one was 162 and for all 3 another 5 hundred something.  My initial reaction was fear as I didnt think another 500 for coils
I ended up doing research got a new coils for 56 bucks
And watched a YouTube video and changed them in 5 min

Long story short this company is a scam idk how they sleep at night with the business they run.
I hope they take a long look at them self in a mirror before they scam another person with something so simple. I understand a family business but this is high way robbery

<Text>This place is an absolute blessing! We have been with them for about six years. They are so much more trustworthy than taking our car to the dealer. We get our oil changed every six months. We were out and suddenly our car just cut off at a STOP light. It started right back up, but it ran raggedy. When we started it back up, it started smoking. I had it towed to Knisiels. They made it a priority to get me back in my car as soon a possible. Even considering that this is my only mode of transportation. My car is over 16 years old. My water pump came apart, which started a domino effect of disasters under the hood. So many things needed to be replaced and repaired.  Within two days, the excellent mechanics here had my car completely repaired and at a reasonable price, and now it is running like a new car.<//Text>< Pics>

Spence and the crew went beyond our wildest hopes of a service facility. We brought our car in due to the water pump leaking and car overheated, mind you this was LATE Friday (barely got to the shop before closing) and they would try to look at it Saturday as they were booked.

Saturday morning Spence told us that someone cancelled their appointment and that he would have the car done before closing. Shortly after we realized that we wouldn't be back in town before the shop closed. Spence arranged for us to pay online and he dropped the keys off in our mailbox (luckily we lived extremely close to the shop).

We went from having our car break down late Friday to picking it up Saturday night. Spence and the crew there did everything they could to get us rolling ASAP and were thorough (even fixing our heater for low cost  as we didn't have any issues before we dropped off our car with them and picked it up to find it not working[and completely unrelated  to what they did])</Text>

I had an oil change done at the Roseville location this weekend, and I was amazed at the professionalism and attention to detail that I received from Spencer and the service team. They were full of appointments, but still fit me in and took time with my car to check everything over. A few maintenance things were brought up, but I didn't feel pressured. I appreciate that they inspect major parts of cars, and even take pictures of their findings and send a full report after the oil change. This alone made me a new regular customer. I appreciate the honesty and customer service, as I have been to several places where the business is not run right at all. They even rotate tires free and give a free carwash coupon after each service. My mom has been going there for years and finally convinced me to go and I'm glad I finally did!<//Text>

My turn signals light bulbs needed to be replaced on the front and rear of my 2003 4Runner. Something simple for most people, but I couldn't do it myself. I am new to this area and live near Kniesel's. I called them up to get a quote on labor as I already had the bulbs. Trey Pundt answered the phone, told me to come on in and they would take a look. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was so impressed from the moment I walked into Kniesel's. Customer Service top notch. Waiting area fantastic! Trey replaced all my bulbs in no time, at no charge . I am very grateful for the wonderful service and your kindness Trey.  Thank You!!!</Text>

I started coming to Kniesel’s in Roseville in May 2018 because of a friend’s recommendation, and I’m so glad I did. The service has never been less than exemplary, and their Guardian inspection has proven invaluable. Every discovered issue, diagnosis, and suggested work has been thoroughly explained and documented (with photos!). Always professional, willing to really work with tricky schedules, and open on Saturdays! Pricing is very competitive and reasonable, and they even wash your car for free (or provide a free voucher). I’ll never go anywhere else as long as I’m in the area.< /text>

< review>
This place is great!  Danny runs a good ship up front navigating phone calls and the arriving customers.  I had been disenchanted w dealerships since I moved to the area and gave these guys a try.  ABSOLUTELY always professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  I recently went in a 7400 mile road trip and they made sure my car was ready for the trip.  I had a correspondence with the during the trip and brought the car in when I returned.  We've got a little work to do on the car now, but let me tell you - the car wash in the end is worth every dollar of service!  It sparkles inside and out - and there's no dust left on the dashboard!  And, the coffee is good, too!<//review>

I have used Kniesel's for over ten years.  I have always received great service from them at both locations.  When I hear or feel something going on with my vehicle that I don't understand, they are more than happy to take a look, even if they don't find anything wrong that needs fixing.  When I do have needed repairs, they provide service with a personal touch.  I have never had any complaints about the work that they have done.  I am a Real Estate Broker and have Kniesel's on the referral list that I provide to my clients when they move into the area.  Keep up the good work!< /review>

Let me tell you something, this has been by far the best car repair experience ever. They were nice professional and kept me aware of everything and told me all my options, helped me with a rental car and when I got my car back it was all clean. Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the engine bay was a little dirty from previous oil change and radiator flush I got. But top notch place!</review>

I received a "Happy Birthday" coupon for an oil change at Kniesel's.  I know they've been in business for quite some time, but I've never been there.  I made an appointment and was pleasantly surprised!  Jason was very nice and I was even given a cupcake!  Start to finish I was in/out in 45 minutes.  Great job!  I will definitely return.  :)< /review>

<username>Richard Espinosa< /username><rating>5< /rating><text>Took my wife's 2008 Lexus RX350 in to have the rear struts replaced.  They were very honest about the cost upfront.  While they had my car, they emailed a comprehensive safety report.  They found a leaky steering rack.  I decided to have them replace it since I have heard noises coming from the steering when turning sharp.  The repair was completed when promised.  The car was washed.  The Service Adviser (Scott Smith) was pleasant to work with.  The car runs great.  I can definitely feel a difference in the steering and the way the car rides.  My wife is very happy with the results.  I would use them again.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Excellent service.  I was greeted immediately and introduced to a Service Advisor who had transferred from the Citrus Heights location.  He understood the service I needed and promptly prepared an estimate including the coupon I had.  Coupons are a definite factor in my returning to Kniesels in addition to the excellent service they provide.  My auto was ready about 15 minutes before promised and the Service Advisor attempted to reach me by phone to notify me.  When I went to get my car, the Advisor explained all the costs involved to my satisfaction.  I do recommend Kniesel's to my friends here in Sun City and I will return when I need service in the future.

Kniesel's patched a tire for me two weeks ago.  Four stars then but just barely.  On this visit I had four new tires installed.  First issue; I asked to have pressures set 10 lbs above spec so that when it cooled down at night I would not have to add air to get to the factory cold pressure spec. (60 front 70 rear).  Instead of 70 psi front and 80 psi rear I got 61 62, 67 and 68 psi.  I had to add air to all four of the tires to get to the factory cold pressure spec.  Next issue was that none of the wheels were put back on the corner that they came off of so my tire pressure monitoring display was all wrong.  I had to get out my TPMS position identifier and re-set the display.  A minor issue was soap on my previously very clean chrome wheels.  Yet another was a modestly damaged valve stem thread where it was seemingly pulled into place with pliers instead of a stem puller.  Another minor one; I asked about their lug nut torqueing practice and was told it is done with a torque wrench by the tech and checked by a supervisor.  Three wheels were torqued properly but one had six of eight lug nuts 10 to 20 ft-lbs low (I pull a 9,000 pound fifth wheel so properly tightened lug nuts are critical).  Finally I arrived early for a 2:30 appointment but didn't get out of there until almost 4:30.  I know some jobs run long but I didn't get the slightest apology that the work took so long.  I'm giving two stars only because in my experience no other local tire shop would have done much better.< /Review>

Brought my '91 Nissan Sentra into Kniesels Automotive here in Roseville CA for a replacement Idle Air Control Valve.  Well, they did the work and it was the best work on a vehicle I have seen.  They had the new IACV in the vehicle in record time.  The price was very economical.  These people are five star all the way, they even found a bolt and 10mm socket I had dropped in my engine cracks and crevices.  I recommend Kniesels Automotive repair for all of your automotive needs.  They are very fair about their prices and the work is excellent.  The quality of work is par excellence.  Thank you Kniesels!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>On a Thursday I had a simple oil change and made an appointment for 8 am in the morning the next Friday. Mark was very helpful and made the appointment for me. On Friday Jason helped me and got right to the oil change at 8 am. A reasonable 45 minutes later I was ready to go and what was so impressing was both persons that helped me knew what needed to be done and there was no confusion because one person helped me. the folks at Kniesel's are engaging and know the business which is refreshing. this was my first visit and my experience was such that I will not hesitate to return as my vehicle needs service.<//Review><user_name>Jennifer Oneill</user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Kniesel's was WONDERFUL!!  They got me in without an appt to replace some burned out bulbs and then offered to take care of my smog check which was due.  Everyone there is professional, committed, efficient and very polite.  And, their women's restroom is absolutely the CLEANEST public restroom I've ever seen!!  You won't be sorry doing business with Kniesel's - they've just become my favorite auto repair shop.  I"m a very happy customer who will return to have any and all work done on my vehicles from them!<//Review>

<review>Jason Sears greeted me upon my arrival within thirty seconds of arriving. He was extremely helpful and made friendly recommendations about what repairs would be needed.  He gave me a no nonsense estimate and called later when the estimate needed to change.  I have had another car serviced here before, and the work was done well.  Kniesel's has serviced my other car very quickly and I got it back the same day.  I plan on coming back to Kniesel's for all my future repairs. - Jon Pickens<//review>< Date>

<Text>I started my relationship with Kniesel's - Roseville, in December 2012.  From day one, they have been exceptional in the level of support and service they provided to me.  I had major repairs needed in my first visit, and I was nervous about starting with a new repair shop.  The staff at Kniesel's, starting with Dane C., was welcoming, supportive, and provided a wonderful service.  They completed all my repairs at below their estimated costs, which was a blessing for me at Christmas!  I took my car in recently, and once again, met with a wonderful level of support.  I know I will continue to bring my business to Kniesel's.  I tell everyone I know about them, and have no problem sharing how wonderful and professional they are.  Thank you Dane C!  Thank you Kniesel's staff!!!!</Text><response>None< /response><user>103600850098569829975</user><name>Michael Henderson< /name>< date>

First off... no, Kniesel's did NOT ask me to write this.  I posted a few days ago my disappointment with a misdiagnosis on my truck. The result?

They not only called to find out what my complaint was, they rescheduled me ASAP, got me a ride home, fixed the problem and THEN went above and beyond:

> Fixed the problem at their cost,
> Did some additional repair that was NOT part of the original estimate, and
> Had the truck washed.

THIS... is excellent customer service.<//Review>

<text>Best oil change I had in awhile. Last time I had an oil change they told me tons of things were wrong with my car all of a sudden. And they charged my account twice! The transaction was smooth and the service was awesome! Can definitely say I'll be back there in the future.< /text>< pictures>

I stopped by and asked for an alignment, smog check and minor repairs.  My vehicle was dropped off in the morning and was ready in the afternoon.  The customer shuttle service to and from the shop was a plus.  Service was great, price is similar to other mechanics but Kniesel's was willing to use the parts that I purchased where other shops turned me away.

< review>
I took my Ford Ranger to Kniesel's Auto Service to have the heater core replaced.  David, my service advisor gave me a thorough breakdown of the cost involved in replacing the heater core.

When I picked up my Ranger, it was washed and ready as promised.  Being a retired mechanic, I was skeptical of the quality of their workmanship as I had never had work done here before.   I was totally surprised of what I saw of the finished repair.  You could not tell that my truck had even been torn apart.

I would highly recommend Kniesel's Auto Service to anyone that asks me for a good auto repair shop.

I've been going to Kniesel's in Roseville since it opened. I also used their Citrus Heights location for many years before that. I have always been extremely satisfied with their work. The service advisers are excellent, the work is top-notch, and they consistently go the extra mile to ensure I am completely satisfied. It's a great local business, and I recommend it without reservations.</Text>

I've been using this location for years to service my vehicles. I've had an issue or two over the years, but they have been quick to resolve anything I bring up. I have since changed my view. Their estimated wait times are strictly a guess. They don't check batteries properly and as a result I had to replace one that went dry. Very disappointed.<//text>

<Review>I have been bringing my 2010 Prius to Kniesel's Roseville for the last 4 oil changes. They know the special needs of my hybrid, their prices are way better than the dealership and on top of that, I get a $10 off coupon each time I come in toward the already-low price of my next oil change. I always wait for my car and they have me in and out in less than an hour. The last time I was in, they noticed a license plate light out and they replaced it at no charge!! This is a friendly, trustworthy shop who understands that sometimes it's more important to make a friend than a couple o bucks. I will keep coming back. Guaranteed!!< /Review>< username>

Used to go to Rocklin for my auto repair needs....until one day my car happened to break down (faulty alternator) and the AAA tow truck driver said I would get a free tow to a AAA recommended shop. The driver said Kniesel's would be a good place to go to have them repair my vehicle. We determined the Roseville location would be the most convienient for me.  I was skeptical of course but didn't have much choice.  So we went....and they took very good care of my vehicle. They even found some issues that the other shop had missed. That was three years ago. I've been going there for my repair needs ever since. I look back on this as a happy accident. I have found a competent, reasonably priced, and clean repair shop close to home. Jason is my go to guy for auto repair needs. He takes the time to explain to me the issues with my vehicle and is quick to honor any special requests (I've taken my car there straight from the body shop and they are careful not to complementary wash the new paint job :-) and they will give me a coupon for the car wash so I can go when the paint is dry).  Bottom line I've never regretted taking my vehicle there. They are always willing to give me a ride in the shuttle whether it be to go home or go to/from work. Kniesel's is an excellent dealer alternative, their prices are competitive and they will not try to sell you a new car every time you go in.</review>

Seems like every couple of months I'm bringing in my car to get something new fixed. I have a 2005 Honda Accord and I want to try and make this car last as long as I can. Recently it wouldn't start again (as I had a brand new starter put in a month ago). I was really frustrated and called the shop. Jason knows me by name at this point. He sent a tow truck to get my car AND a rental to pick me up...no out of pocket on my part. The guys diagnosed it as a bad part in the starter and replaced it again since it was under warranty. Offering up the rental and having it for two days at no cost was a stress saver to say the least! I guess this is the kind of service that keeps me coming back to them each time I need something done :)< /review>< pictures>

<text>I was pleasantly surprised when Jason and the service tech. walked out to my daughter's car within 3 minutes of me walking through the door.  In about 20 mins (maybe less) they had completed my oil change and their multi-point inspection, checked and filled all my fluids for the exact low price they quoted before they started the work.  In other words, I was not charged anything extra for them to top off my washer fluid.  The staff management and service worked very well together and seemed to get along very well. My wait in the waiting room was very tranquil as the tropical fish tank was very entertaining.  Looking forward to my next visit.</text>< pictures>

Had a set of wheels installed. Two of the wheels were not balanced very well. 1/4 OZ off on one a little more that an 1/8 OZ off on the other. Not OK, since you can detect it a 65mph. I had to pay for another shop (Firestone) to do it right. Next, the mechanic started it up dead cold and took off flying on a test drive without letting the engine warm up. The car is brand new and this is really bad on new engines. I am a former mechanic and know better. So should Kniesel's. I won't be back.</Text>

Took my Lexus to Kniesel's when it wasn't starting. The problem was fixed quickly and I haven't had any issues since. I recommend coming to Kniesel's if you have any car issues. They're a very honest auto service.<//Text>

I was pleasantly surprised when Jason and the service tech. walked out to my daughter's car within 3 minutes of me walking through the door.  In about 20 mins (maybe less) they had completed my oil change and their multi-point inspection, checked and filled all my fluids for the exact low price they quoted before they started the work.  In other words, I was not charged anything extra for them to top off my washer fluid.  The staff management and service worked very well together and seemed to get along very well. My wait in the waiting room was very tranquil as the tropical fish tank was very entertaining.  Looking forward to my next visit.< /Text>

Came in with an unknown problem with my headlights they found out what was wrong, how to fix it, had the correct parts and got it all done in fast, informative, and effective manor.  Their customer service was welcoming and ontop of all this the repair was only half of what a similar shop quoted.<//Review>

<Time>1364233197650</Time><Review>Called to find out how much they charge to replace a sensor and the guy was telling me they have to do a diagnostic that adds on 115.00. I told him the dealership already did a diagnostic I just needed them to fix the sensor. The guy was rude and obviously did not want to do the service without adding on cost . So I will not go here. If your rude and trying to scam me over the phone , why would I let you touch my car. FYI just because they have a nice building doesn't mean they provide better service.< /Review>< Rate>

<text>As someone going through financial and other very serious life/health issues, I think it would serve you best to train management / employees to not laugh when customers are inquiring on pricing, I've heard good things about this establishment, but don't underestimate the intelligence of someone raised by someone who worked on military Aircraft engines. I have -NEVER- heard of a mechanic needing a VIN # to get 'an accurate quote' while just before, insulting me by saying you couldn't, without the make/model - when it was mentioned several times over, then mention the VIN. What?! I just wanted a ballpark dude..

Makes no sense, maybe get off social media while on the phone with customers or actually pay attention to what they are telling you. I am guessing because I have a car nearly 20 years old they figured I wasn't worth fair dialogue with integrity, which is a shame because the person sounded very kind until laughing in my ear and mentioning the VIN.

I will also add they have needed multiple tries to fix an issue they guaranteed was fixed and then implied if it wasn't, they would need to do something else requiring more money on top. Luckily the issue stayed fixed after multiple visits, because I would have gotten every last cent back if not.

Thanks for the time, hopefully you motivate / train your employees and management better which would reflect back to how they treat customers, but I am just assuming you figured my business was 'bottom of the barrel' since you made that clear in the way you handled our conversation, in my eyes. Who knows, maybe you heard a good joke on the other side of the room during our convo? Doubtful

EDIT - I just got off the phone with another mechanic, he did agree that IN special cases, VIN's do help with giving an accurate quote, although in this case considering I wanted a ballpark, the price is negligible and your reaction makes no sense / you were too lazy to research it. If you are so worried you can't articulate a ballpark figure because a few bad lemons with little education couldn't comprehend what an estimation means, I suggest  Kniesels getting someone who can better and properly articulate while being confident in what they speak. People are skeptical of what they don't understand, and in your line of business, whoever I talked to on the phone is the epitome of why.</text>< pics>

Just got my oil change done here for the first time and I was honestly impressed by their service. Very clean place, the service was fast , the location is great also , right across the street from Starbucks.  I even got a phone call today to ask me about my experience. That's a lot of service for just an oil change. They even put a coupon on my windshield for my next vist. Defenetly going there again.< /text>

Jason and his staff are extremely helpful and customer service oriented. As soon as you walk in the door at Kniesel's Service Center in Roseville, you are greeted by a warm smile and a firm handshake. Jason listens intently, making notes and asking questions when you are finished. Then he quickly writes up your ticket, lays it out in front of you and explains everything that his experienced staff will do to put your car in top condition while making your wait as comfortable and convenient for you as possible. If you need a ride, either take their shuttle in the morning and afternoon or one of their staff will take you to your next destination as soon as they are available. If you decide to wait, the high speed Wi-Fi and tasty Keurig fresh-brewed-every-time coffee will make your stay comfortable and productive.

When your car is ready, Jason or one of his staff will pick you up from your "waiting zone" and bring you back to the shop. They will print up the completed work order and insure that everything that you expected was accomplished including a test drive if needed. And Kniesel's always performs a 28 point safety and fluid check. And an added bonus, the car is detailed by the nearby auto wash. What a deal!

Finally, Jason will review with you the recommended services or repairs that your car needs based on mileage, make, model and condition. If you listen to Jason and his explanation you will never go wrong. He will also explain what services and repairs can wait and what you should do soon. His only goal is to make sure you are never unaware of any safety items or maintenance items that would cause your car to underperform or breakdown and cause you an inconvenience or an emergency.

I have been a Kniesel's customer for over 20 years and I expect that I will be for 20 more years. I always tell my friends and family that Kniesel's is the best value in auto service in Northern California. Try them and you will see what I mean.</Review>

At Kniesel's they were the best. I was in for a Ford Winstar and for some reason my van broke down. I went there the next day and they told me they could fix it. Also i went in at another car repair for my oil leaking and they said ok it would cost us 10 dollars and they did it. Next day later oil leak! Kniesel's boom they fixed it .<//Text>

Both me and my fiancée have always had a good experience and great service with Kniesel repair shop. Recently, I took my car in for a Timing Belt replacement as well as double check some noise in the suspension in the front end of the car. Another repair shot had told me I needed 100's of dollars of work on my suspension. As it turned out I only needed a new set of Hub Caps. The mechanics at Kniesel saved me lots of money. Also, I was very pleased with the workmanship on the Timing Belt replacement. They fully explained to me what all had to be done with the Timing Belt replacement, as well at the costs involved, and how they also do a more complete job of it than most car repair shops. Which I appreciated greatly, because I've had a Timing Belt go out on me in the past and it would have cost me over $1500.00. I was so satisfied with their car repair service  on my car, that when I was at Sears, where I bought my Tires for a FREE tire rotation and balancing check, I gave them as a reference to a lady that was sitting in the Waiting Room with me, getting her car's brakes fixed. It was a great experience working with Kniesel, and I intend to keep going back to them for service not only on my car, but also my fiancée's car.< /text>

I trusted them 30 years ago with my Pinto and I do today. If you want to be able to trust that the work is done right and only done if you need it go to Kniesel's.</review>

<review>Don't go there if you want value for your money, they charge more than what the dealers charge and by roughly one and a half times more, I couldn't believe my ears. I decided to ok the repairs because I already had them do a diagnostics check ($116 to read a scanner which probably didn't take more than 10 mins) and I just didn't want to pay a dealer for another diagnostic check.
The job itself wasn't bad but it was rea.....lly costly $$$$$$....
They will NOT match the dealer's price, will give you some discount after lot's of hassle but you'll still pay more than at dealer's. Small shops like this should be charging much less than dealers'.
Don't go there unless money is no issue.</review><Name>Sergio Platonoff<//Name><rate>1<//rate><Response>None< /Response></record>

Well I was in the market for a new van on a saturday. And I stubbled across Kniesels and when i arrived i could see that they were really busy, but i needed to get the van inspected and make sure it was a good price and quality for my family and I. so jason did a great job and got us in that day and let us know a few things that were going on with the van and brought them to my attention. I ended up buying the van and based on the customer service and knowledge of the employees at Kniesels my family and I will be a customer for life. thanks guys!!!   love the van.<//Text>

Jason is friendly and the staff does smile. my car has been here before and unfortunately I have been taken for a ride by other dealers before so I don't have much to say. I wish i knew more about BMW'S in order to narrow diagnostics down at least. My car is always washed and runnin' so that is half the battle, right?< /Text>

I like the bar and the staff is nice. This will be a great place once thing get back to normal. Typically, I do not write a reviews for any place but after reading some of the reviews here I thought I needed to for places I like that are getting bad reviews because people seem to forget we have been in a pandemic. For a place to be open they have to serve food  it is a  state rule. You should know this before going into a bar and most places tell you as soon as you walk in and every bar I have been into in Palm Spring has said it. Some bars maybe short staffed and it could take a lot longer to get served drinks and most are not use to doing food . Keep in mind its hard to keep staff when you are open one day and required to close the next.</review>

This isn’t a traditional Eagle so don’t expect leather and hot men on the patio. The food was actually good but the service was truly lacking. There was a little host wearing no shirt and he was running around but doing nothing. We waited forever to get a drink order. We waited a very long time to get our food. We even waited and had to look for our server to pay. It’s like they didn’t want our money. The host who I mentioned earlier wasn’t lifting a finger to do a thing. He just seemed to be confused and walking in circles. I’ve been in the business for a very long time and the one thing I learned is team mentality. If a server is in the weeds, you help that server out. It’s all to expedite the experience of the guests so that we can get in and get out to free up another table. So please retrain this host so that he can become a better employee. Hosting isn’t cruising. He needs to understand the difference.</Text>

<Review>Terrible. Music at a funeral would be better than what was playing tonight.  One server for our non full area, that was not attentive.  We were there for 2 hours & only had 2 beers. Not because we didn't want to drink, but because he was that SLOW!!!
Local restaurants had better music.< /Review>< rate>

<text>They've fluffed up this bar a bit and it looks nice and fresh but still has that feel of a 1st class dive bar. Drinks are great and the service is spot on. Lots of men hanging out enjoying a cocktail or a cold beer. I was there during the middle of a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly busy. As for ADA access they are lacking. If you're in a wheelchair the door is small to enter and has a bit of a lip to it to get inside. Once inside the bathrooms do not accommodate an electric wheelchair. I had to park mine outside the ADA Bathroom and walk into where the pot is right next to the door. Pretty uncomfortable situation. They get an 'F' on how they remodeled for ADA accommodation.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80db1b5d7157c143:0x877b5092d95abd8d< /gmapID></record>

When we heard a leather bar was opening on Arenas, we were initially skeptical. But it has exceeded our expectations in every way. The owner Scott truly cares about the leather community and bringing visibility. The staff is incredible, especially our new friends Martin, Andre, Sam, and Johnnie.

If you want to support visibility for the leather community, this bar is for you.</review>

I was on a casual visit to Palm Springs (I live in NYC) and this place quickly became my ‘Cheers,’ due in no small part to the charm and warmth exuded by Thomas, the friendly bartender. Don’t miss it!</text>

The Eagle 501 has potential.  It needs to decide that it's a leather bar and go for it.  It also needs to get its $h!+ together as far as music goes. Tonight they were playing the Beatles(❓❗) If they don't, they're just going to be another bar on Arenas.  And then, why bother?< /review>

< review>
This bar has a very different crowd from one day to another. Was here on a Friday night and the crowd seemed to be jovial and very friendly. However Saturday during the day I found the crowd to be very clicky and a little overly intoxicated.</review>
<response>{'time': 1568255695797, 'text': "We're so sorry for your experience. Yes, there are sometimes different crowds during the daytime than at night. I'll make sure that our bartenders stop serving intoxicated customers. Thank you for your comments."}<//response><name>Richard George< /name>< userid>

I can’t say enough good things I have been a on and off client for 20 years , I have proven data that when I don’t work my business it works me . In those times I am struggling I am not applying the skills I gained from Drive. They have the tools available for shop owners and it’s up to us to use them and be proactive to have a better business and better peace of mind. It is up to you if you want the skills and proven track record they have to help you with your goals for your business. And the New name “Drive “ is great, they do what the name says .< /review>

Management Success has been a very powerful tool,  when I started with MS more than 15 years ago I knew nothing about running a business.   I am now having fun running 2 shops that both make money, with the help of Gloria (my consultant) and everyone else at MS.   One of the best things about MS is you have a huge network of shop owners to get and share advice with.   You will make some powerful new friends here. Worth every penny!  Thanks MS<//text>

< Review>
I Love Management Success!!! They have helped me understand how to run my business instead of working for my business and run it efficient. They also showed me how to hire the right people, assemble a great Team and market my business effectively, which in return created a steady work flow and a great working environment. I am finally happy again to come to work and am now able to work normal hours (8:00 - 5:00) so i can spend more time with my family! I highly recommend Management Success to anyone that owns an Automotive Repair Shop or is starting a new one and doesn't want to be held hostage by his business!!!
Thank you Management Success!!!< /Review>

<text>Our shop was in it's third year when we saw an ad from Management success in our mail box. As an owner I was running around like a nut. We were doing great work and the shop was getting very busy.  I was writing service, helping with repairs and handling the bulk of the paperwork and all of the marketing. I felt a ton of pressure. I knew where I wanted to go with my business but figured it would take ten years to get there. After attending the seminar my wife and I realized Management Success had the plan and path to get us where we wanted to be. The best part was we could get there much faster and with a lot less stress. We knew it was a big investment but felt it was worth the risk. After signing on for consulting I soon found out the program was working. Management Success showed us a plan for all aspects of our shop from appearance, advertising, marketing all the way to work flow and employees. After all of the pieces started to fit together our business took off. It is truly amazing!
Thanks to Management success we not only are reaching our goals for the year, we are blowing them away!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Management Success taught me how to look at the shop with using graphs and statistics. Know I manage my business weekly. They showed me how to handle work flow, manage my employees, and customers. We now have a budget in place for marketing and do this monthly. We have been using Management Success for many years. I do not know were I would be today if it was not for them.  I have taken most of there classes and each time we have set new high levels for the shop.  We first got started I had only one employee and now there is six of us. The shop runs smoothly and I take a week off without any stress. I am a much happier guy and can take time to watch my son high school games.

Thank you
Steve McNamara

Hands down! The best automotive training group in the USA!! Done lots of training since 1979 when I started in the Auto industry. No ONE has a program like this. The power of this group is the not only that they trained me on being a better owner. They train my staff to become able to sell, manage, execute and communicate with complete confidence. Success is what they created in our shop.<//Text>

Just hit one year with MS. Sales are up from last year to date $187,264.77.  We were doing okay before we joined MS but seemed to have plateaued. What MS has done for us is taken us to the next level, and now we are pursuing even the next level. The sky is the limit and the whole team is on board. We are a four bay shop in a rural area that won't quite hit a million this year but definitely will next year. It takes a lot of work but MS gives you the tools to work with and helps you along the way. The money we spent we recovered relatively quickly. MS will improve your business, it's still up to you how much. Thank you for being a large part of our new success!! Four stars just because nobody is perfect:)</text>

I signed on with Management Success in 2007. This was about the time I was going to close my shop that I had run for 10 years and could never seem to get ahead. After signing up and APPLYING what my training and consultant were providing me, we started becoming profitable. It is now 5 years later and we have grown from a one person shop, to a four person shop that is profitable, debt free, and has money in savings. The best part is, I can walk out the door and we still make money. Thanks Management Success!< /text>

After going through some difficulties as new shop owners, we decided it was time to make a change.  So we went to a Management Success seminar.  It was like they had been to our shop and knew all of our problems.
Wade stayed in the shop until 1am everyday because he would get behind from doing all of the front and back work.  I worked a full time job and would come to the shop in the evening to do the paperwork.  We wasn't able to spend any time with our kids.
After we started Management Success, I have been able to quit my job and work at the shop full time.  Wade and I are both able to leave at 5 now, plus we are able to leave and go do things with the kids.
We're now running a profitable business making the money we should have been making from the beginning.  We were able to hire several more staff and now have both the front end and the back end being managed.  Our shop is doing very well.

Thanks,
Wade and Kristi Wright

After being in business for fifteen years my wife and i went to a management success weekend seminar and wow what an eye opening experience. All the struggles we had encountered for all those years were addressed that weekend. We got involved with the company and with there help took our company to a new level of success. They have the tools they teach you so you can apply every week to keep your business growing without being a prisoner of the business. It is a great company to be involved with and there passion to help is amazing.</text>

<Text>With the help of management success my bushiness runs profitable without me being there on a daily basis. I have a great team of employees that all work together to achieve a common goal. Before i used the consulting services from management successes. I worked 60 plus hours a week with no vacation and no reserves.  Now I work less then 40 hours a week and can take a vacation for 3 weeks at a time. My shops sales and customer base have been increasing during the economic down turn.  Thank you Ron, Karla and all the consultant's that helped me get my bushiness running profitable and successful.</Text><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The AMAZING TEAM! at Management Success has helped me transform my small general automotive repair shop into a strong, profitable, successful business that is thriving in this new economy. The knowledge that I have gained from the staff at Management Success has given me the tools needed to run my business as an owner. If your shop is not doing well and you are looking for help, and you are willing to change, the team at Management Success will get you where you want to go. I have no doubt that my shop would not exist today without the help I received from this company. I will continue to refer any shop owner who is struggling to the AMAZING TEAM at Management Success.

After being in business for 13 years and throwing away numerous Management Success flyers and advertisements, we decided to sign up for our first seminar almost a year ago. Since then we've worked with our consultant and attended workshops that have given us the tools to manage our shop which has opened up doors to more profits, more freedom and peace of mind. We look forward to our future with Management Success and the additional tools that will help our shop grow and move in the right direction and continue to increase our profits and freedom. We wish we would have signed up for the program years ago and highly recommend the program to any new or established shops.

<review>I had been in business for 20 years by the time I joined Management Success. I succeeded in ducking their promotions for a couple of years, but after figuring out that I wasn't making much money and had no time for my family, I decided to go to their seminar. Well, the rest if history. I found out how much I didn't know and what was holding me back. In 2008 I was able to take a 5 week motorcycle trip to the west coast and the place was running as well when I got back as when I had left. I have a great team in place, who care about each other, and a manager, who creates expansion. Every successful person has had help along the way, but perversely, shop owners think they can do it on their own. Unless we view the business as an asset that can exist without us, we just went from being an employee of somebody else to owning a job. As Michael Gerber says in "The E Myth Revisited", "if you are self employed, you are working for a lunatic". Management Success teaches you how to be a business owner, not a self employed individual. There is no freedom in being self employed. That luxury is only reserved for business owners.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>A big thanks to the folks at Management Success! for helping me better understand the day to day operations and organization of a profitable repair shop. The seminars which I attended at their HQ in Glendale were informative, enjoyable and most of all never had me feeling drowsy. A great bunch of people with many great ideas and strategies!

Thanks Desirae and Wes!

<text>Through working with this company, I've gained a new perspective on life and on my business.  I've made a lot of friends and connections that I can actually talk shop with (when the significant other couldn't care less :) ).  Though trying something new by working with them was a little scary in the beginning, Management Success! has helped me make my business work for me (not the other way around.)  And each person I interact with there cares about what they are doing and acts with integrity, which is refreshing.  These guys raise the bar for auto repair shops, and in turn help you become the shop that raises the bar for others.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2c057cb0068fd:0xf011f875867d3cc7<//gmapID><time>1384197648822<//time></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None< /pics><Time>1375305657660<//Time><review>Six years ago I went to a Management success seminar and my life hasn't been the same since.
I was hesitant to go in the first place. It was a three hour drive, my weekend would be lost, and didn't know if I'd get anything more then any other seminar I'd been to. I'm so glad I did!  I'll never forget Lisa, she called to invite me to their seminar. She listened to my struggles and gave me the solution. At that time I was working 65 to 70 hours a week and was making no more money then a good technician at the local dealership. I always felt like I was running around like a crazy person but couldn't get ahead. The money came in and at the end of the month it was all gone month after month after month. She told me they could help me get things under control, reduce my hours and I'd make more money too. Luckily I decided to go.
Today I work 30 to 35 hours a week and make more money to boot. I can't thank them enough for what they've taught me and helped my accomplish. The changes have improved my life and most importantly I have time to spend with my family.< /review>< gmap_id>

Management Success! is the premier training organization for any small auto-repair business looking to step up in any way. MS! agents and consultants are honest, friendly people who will go out of their way to ensure you understand how to apply the tools they provide, as well as the heart to follow up with positive, reinforcing motivation. What a great company and group of individuals working to build up an industry with a dire need for such. Thank you MS!< /Text>

<review>If you are having doubts about the future of your business or if you are in a secure position and would like to expand but not quite sure how, you NEED Management Success ! We have been clients for 2 years and I can honestly say that without the help of Management Success my shop would have closed. We have been able to completely change our existence and are now more profitable than ever, and able to take time away from the shop without "paying for it" when we return. The only reason I can see for any Management Success client to fail is because they did not  implement the necessary recommendations. It is refreshing to finally find a company that does EVERYTHING the say that can be accomplished for your situation !</review>< Pics>

< Review>
When we initially started with MS they asked us for ALOT of money up front. It seemed like they had a good product, and we needed help so we signed up. Shortly after signing we realized we really did not "click" with our consultant. She ended up leaving MS, and a new consultant was hired. The new consultant had no idea about the Automotive Industry at all! She was just a consultant. We never really felt like we got what we paid for. The cost was so significant and just when we thought we were getting "over the hump" MS wanted more money for us to continue. Besides the cost of the program, flying from the east coast to the west coast, paying for a hotel and meals so we could attend the classes - for our small business it just plain cost too much money. We were getting more behind.
In the last few months we have signed on with another company which does the same sort of thing on the east coast. There is one fee up front (no hidden costs) and a guarantee that we will reach the agreed upon goal or they will continue to help us (free of charge) until we get there. Our consultant has been in the automotive industry all of his life, and has owned his own shops (two of them). He is REALLY helping us make big strides towards our goal.
MS was a stepping stone, but I think dollar for dollar we are getting a much better deal now.< /Review>

<Text>I can't say enough good things about these guys. If it wasn't for their help my business would have closed years ago. Now I have a better understanding of how to run my shop profitably. I'm making money now, and I have access to probably the greatest network of auto repair shop owners anywhere. The tools they give you are irreplaceable and they way they teach you to use them is second to none. Always professional and great group of people overall. Rarely have I had the opportunity to be a part of such a terrific group of individuals.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>As I look back at where I was before I overcame my stubbornness to get business management help, to where I am now I have to acknowledge Management Success for all they taught me over the years. I invested in many employees as well as many pieces of equipment and was successful in other peoples eyes but MY success was due to my relationship with Management Success. I thank the staff past and present for giving me the guidance and training to make me to able to pursue activities I care to pursue personally as well as in my business.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2c057cb0068fd:0xf011f875867d3cc7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>MS! has done more for me in improving my business than I could have ever done by myself. I'm a mechanic that opened a shop thinking that because I knew cars that I could run a shop. I quickly learned that wasn't true. Luckily I attended a Management Success seminar. I knew right away that they would be able to teach me everything I would need to know about running an auto repair shop.  I've been working with management success since 1999 and now I have one of the top shops.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Management Success has helped us take our business from mediocre to great! We had staffing issues, we were not making any money and we did not enjoy coming to work. We were ready to sell the business. Currently, we have been able to put away savings, the cash flow is there, we are in control of the daily functions of our business and our staff are happy to work for us. They have truly changed our lives and made our business great! We enjoy working with them and look forward to many more years to come! As for our Consultant Wes, he is absolutely wonderful!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I was only in business for a few years and was a one-man-band trying to do it all myself. I figured I would hire people as the business grew. The fact was that I could only get about 5 hours of work done in a 10 hour day. With the help of Management Success! I have been able to see that my growth was severely limited by trying to do things that way. I have since hired good people to do the major operations of the shop so that I can spend my time doing what I should be doing - working on the shop instead of working in the shop. My sales have tripled in the last 2 years and I have plans in place to continue that rate of growth. They have been incredibly helpful in all areas of my business including hiring, employee management, marketing, accounting, financial planning, and communicating better with customers to be a more effective service writer.
I am so glad that I made the decision to allow Management Success! to help me make my business what I truly want it to be and by extension make my life what I want it to be.</text>

< Review>
Every business owner starts their business at some level of knowledge and experience.  In my situation, I was good at fixing cars  and well organized.  I was competent enough to open the doors and get started.  One important thing was missing and that was the knowledge associated with running an automotive repair shop.  I spent over 10 years running what I thought was a good facility.  Trial and error, ups and downs, learning curves were the name of the game.  It wasn't until I stepped up to the plate and started taking course after course from Management Success, that,  I realized  I could become a professional.  I currently run a well oiled machine, thanks to the education I received from Management Success.<//Review>

<Text>It took me four years after paying for the seminar to go to it. I talked my wife into going even although she was prepared to be totally bored. Well, waiting that 4 years cost me around $400,000.00 for each year because in my first year on the program I doubled my Gross Sales! My wife joined me in the business to do my marketing & is still doing so.
My consultant was THE BEST to get me to do what I had needed to have done many years earlier by holding my feet to the fire as I was a huge procrastinator! I jumped into the program with both feet & after 4 years in the program I regret none of the actions I have accomplished through the help of Management Success. Every class I have taken has improved me as well as my business to which I am very grateful!
I whole heartedly recommend that every one that is in the automotive business, whether it be a general repair shop, body shop or big truck shop, to sign up with Management Success & then give it your all & I know you will improve yourself while greatly improving your business sales & profits. Clients of MS! are wonderful people & I have gained many great friends across this nation & Canada as a result.
I am still a client & will remain so as long as I have my automotive shop because I will not stop learning how to continue to improve my business with their help<//Text><name>Robert Archer< /name>< user_id>

Thanks to the Management Success Team for helping our business to become more productive, profitable and a more enjoyable place to work. From their recommendations and consulting we have almost doubled our gross sales, and retained more of the sales as profit in the 3 years since joining Management Success. We have better handle on managing our business financially, thru the use of key statistics. We have progressed to have more time away from the shop than in previous years. Thanks Again for what we have accomplished thus far. Evan & Mary Lang< /Text>

Management Success! taught us the skills we needed to be very successful Truck  Shop Owners.  We had the tools to work on the trucks but we were lacking the tools to manage and run the shop.  Now our tool box is full and our shop is growing by leaps and bounds.  Thank you Management Success! for taking the stress out of our lives and consulting us towards the life we truly want to live.</review>

Management Success taught me how to manage my business using graphs and statistics. They showed me how to efficiently handle work flow, the crew, and my customers. Before when we did $25,000 a week in sales I was running around with my hair on fire and working long hours. Now when we do $60,000 the shop runs smooth and I can leave when I want. I’m a much happier owner today and my family sees me more. Management Success has helped me grow my shop from 1.7 to 2.6 in just 5 years with a bad economy.

Thanks for all the great help

We started with M/S in 2009,they taught us to hire the right people,manage by the numbers,put policies in place for jobs, empower your people and hold them accountable.
Using these tools we have steady growth,(double digit) $ in the bank,time off when wanted,a current payable list and much less STRESS.

Thanks M/S

<Text>My brother and I joined MS! in September 2014 in pursuit of taking over our fathers shop.  We joined not knowing anything about how to really run a business.  A technician and a customer service rep...not business owners.  We were heading in a downward path with the shop and in just 3 months we are making leaps and bounds!!!  Our consultant and the entire team of MS! take you step by step...never leaving you fall behind and always holding you accountable.  We couldn't be more happy with the decision we have made...just wishing we would have made it sooner! Thank you so much, and we can't wait to see what you have in store for us in the years to come!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Management success has been a great partner in helping us grow our business.  They have provided us with the management tools to understand exactly how our business is doing on a week to week basis and how to make changes that help us to continue on the right track.  They also have a wonderful website development team and we have had many comments from new customers about how nice our website is.< /text>

Thanks, Management Success! I have my life back, money in the bank and a sense of security and well-being. Fear, doubt and pride held me back for far too long. I wanted to do it on my own, not asking for help or guidance. It was my business and I wanted to run it my way. Management Success didn’t change that. They guided me and my business through an evolution in a matter of months.< /Review>

<review>These guys are for real!!  They helped me take my shop from a small family run operation, working 7 days a week, barely making ends meet to now......we are a large company, growing all the time. We are profitable and now we consider ourselves HAPPY business owners.  From marketing to sales, efficiency to production, they have seen it all and have helped us grow to a size I never thought possible. Everyone that works for Management Success are very polite and extremely helpful!  In my mind they are the only people out there that have the ability and technology to truly make your Collision or Mechanical shop profitable and organized!

When we started with Management Success we were a very busy shop with no money and an owner that knew a lot about fixing trucks but nothing about running a business. We now have money, just purchased our building and the owner spends his time working on the business instead of just being an employee. Cannot say enough about how far we have gone with the knowledge that we gained from our relationship with MS!

<Date>1420486271932< /Date><rating>5</rating><review>We have been shop owners for almost 12 years and for the most part, our business has run our lives. My husband has worked countless hours every week and I have helped him as I could. Although we have always been able to make ends meet financially we have been enslaved to our business and getting sick of it! MS! contacted us yearly for 6 years before we finally agreed to go to one of the weekend seminars in 2013. We were very skeptical but signed up for the 6 month consulting program.  We learnt a lot about industry standards, how to track our costs, what we needed to bill to make a profit, what was an acceptable price for the services we provided, how to run an organized shop...and so much more!  We set goals (a family vacation, money in the bank, a 69 Camaro...) at the beginning of our consulting and 11 months later we had achieved them. We still have a lot to learn and implement but we feel we are so much better equipped to be business owners. The staff at MS! are great, we have enjoyed getting to know some of them as well as many other shop owners. The only draw back of the consulting program for us was the amount of time and money we had to spend to travel for the workshops. Being from Canada it really adds up, but I would still say its been worth it!< /review>< pictures>

<text>I dragged my husband to the seminar because I was tired of supporting his hobby called auto repair business. Now 8 years later we are running the business together and are very happy with the help we are receiving from Management Success. We are now competent business owners and have help within reach any time we need it. Thank you Management Success.

We have been MS clients since February 2013, during that time MS have been there to coach us in the building of our business. It is like getting a 4 year degree from a University - but in this case it is real life experience rather than text book.

I would highly recommend them to any Auto Repair business that wants to grow in size and character. These guys are AWESOME!!!< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Working with Management Success was the smartest thing I ever did in management,
don't get me wrong I did a lot of right things over the years but when you think you know everything you can't learn and things only get better from trial and error or luck and I've never been much of a gambler . The product and service of this organization is the best anywhere and I've seen it all. No matter what size level or condition your company is they can make it better. The more you do with them the better things get.

Working with MS has been a great help to our company. We might not be in business right now if it had not been for their guidance. The only reason I have not given a Five star rating is because I believe we should all continually improve.< /Text>

<Text>I was pretty new business owner in over my head.  I had only been a tech my whole carrier, and owning a business was a whole new thing to me.  I decided to go to the seminar in Denver just as my partner decided to back  out, so I was on the verge of either closing or trying this.  After a year I have expanded and doubled in size and sales, and now become profitable Finally.  I owe alot to Gibran, my consultant who has applied just enough pressure to keep me on the right track.  Thank you<//Text>< response>

Thank you "Team Management Success!".

We have been in business 20+ years and we were looking for a business coach. A specific "automotive" business coach to not only help us improve our methods and conditions but help us with transitioning those conditions to our next generation of owners. We found that in Management Success!.
MS! has definitely moved our auto repair company up a notch or two. I can now prove that statement with statistics I have learned to measure with their program. Statistics not only recorded each and every week but evaluated for monetary and personal worth. Does a 15% increase in sales to 1.4 million dollars, a 25% increase in Net Profit and a four+ weeks per year vacation time grab your attention? We did it through our training, education and coaching with Management Success! and we are not through yet.

Once you make your decision to go with Management Success!, believe it or not, you will enjoy the price of this investment in your company. You will enjoy and look forward to their guidance throughout the program. Not only because those at MS! really seem to love their jobs and make it fun for us but probably because their program really works! You will enjoy the classes professionally taught by "those in the know" about our auto repair industry. You will enjoy your coaches personal attention to you and your specific shop and you will enjoy networking with other shops around the country.

Thank you once again "Team Management Success!".  We're looking forward to our long term relationship with you.<//Text>

<Text>They are a bit horrible, I would avoid at all costs. In the first class they have in your nearby city it will sound amazing.
If you keep the book from that class and use your auto body trade magazines as references you will find all the numbers and processes you need to have and all the same suggestions they give for doing things. If you are a really small shop they just don't get it. They don't understand every market.

They will have you do things that are against your morals(at least mine) like suggesting "tipping" tow drivers to bring in cars. Offering 'gift certificates' for people bringing in cars. As well as cheesy ideas that are embarrassing to even implement. I did them because they said to do them and feel I alienated more customers than I gained.

I would try a different consultant agency before giving over the $14K they want for the first 6 month 'program' that also requires two trips on your own dime to Cali.

Read the trade magazines and implement the suggestions in them. Hire a quickbooks pro consultant for that work. Get a good accountant who will look out for your best interests. Then if that doesn't work hire a collision consultant who has actually worked in a body shop.

The MS! consultants seem to have never set foot in an actual shop. They just give you a pattern of plans to follow that are available for free if you pay attention to all the available resources in the industry.

If your numbers(percentages) are good then get someone who will come into your shop and help you work on processes. Not all of what MS! teaches is bad, they do have some good info, but you can get the same info on your own.

Last but not least they are owned by and located in a building apparently owned by WISE Group which is owned by the Church of Scientology's investment arm or something related. They will use some pretty shady methods to turn you against your spouse and family by calling the "suppressive persons".

They use L. Ron Hubbards accounting/management methods, which is fine but the whole thing feels like a really dirty setup. I came back from CA after the first 'workshop' and felt so dirty. I was practically in tears wishing I had never signed up. Something isn't right and there are better consultants out there.

Did I learn some things? Yes. Was it worth the cost? no, not financially and definitely not emotionally.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< userid>

Management Success has saved my business from a slow death!   My consultant Desirae is amazing and helps push me to building the business up!    Had Williams Automotive Inc not seeked Management Success's help I do not think we would still be in business today - I can say now (with no hesitation) that there is a light @ the end of the tunnel and I can honestly see making money in this business now.   I can see the stress's of this business slowly melting away  .... I can not say enough about Management Success and I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone!    Just jump in with both feet I would tell them - it will DEF pay off!</Text>

They can not make you do anything or change any thing, but if you are ready for change then these are your guys.  you get out of it what you put in it. you can get as much or as little as you want... i wish i had implemented more things and did what they told me more. i would have gotten more but that was my fault not theirs!

<Review>I have been using Management Success as a consulting firm for my business and to manage my website for many years now. The customer service I recieve from MS is Excellent. My consultant is very knowledgeable, professional, and always leaning on me to do better...I need that. Not like a drill instructor, but like a business partner that is vested in my success.The advice they offer is not made up, it's comprised from information that they have derived from dealing with automotive shops across the country.  I receive compliments on my website by many sources that offer the same service and from my customers. I would highly recommend them, especially to a newer start-up shop...they will get you started on the right foot.

In 2004 my wife and I opened an RV and travel trailer service company in Houston, Tx., with much anticipation and excitement. We managed to outgrow our first facility in the first year of business and moved to a much larger facility. There we found we were seemingly busy and working hard, but terminally broke. We were grossing $750,000.00 but had nothing left for ourselves beyond bare minimums. In 2008 my wife convinced me to go to a seminar in Dallas, and with much grumbling I ceded defeat and went. I liked what they had to say and found the prospects quite intriguing, but was very skeptical as seemingly most "consultants" are interested in extracting cash from your pocket, but really having no interest in helping you learn how to be profitable. Well, the long and short of it is that we signed up for the program and have been with Management Success for continuing education and consulting ever since. As a matter of fact, we have just entered the Masters program and have recently completed our third move for the business due to growth. In our last facility (the second one) we just finished 2011 and 2012 with back to back years of $1,400,000.00 and were completely maxed out on what we could produce there. We are currently in the process of up-staffing to meet the demands of our customers and the increased work load. we are projecting around $1,800,000.00 or better for 2014. Our success and growth we have experienced has been to the grace and generosity of God and His limitless mercy, and the quality, sound business advise from the staff of Management Success. If you are sitting on the fence wondering whether you should make the move to their services, the answer is whole heartedly yes!!! If you do not take advantage of what they have to offer, you will never know how successful you could have been.</text>

We opened our shop in September of 2004, my husband working as a tech with 1 helper. I remember going to the seminar in August of 2010 having no money and making no money.  We signed up for a 6 month training program. Scared to death, 2 credit cards later and not knowing how we were going to pay it off or if the program would work....  Well now we have 3 Tech, 1 SW and my husband is finally wearing the owner's hat and we tripled our sales.  This was definitely the best decision we have ever made!!!
Everyone at Management Success are the nicest, most honest, hard- working people you could ever meet!  They truly want every shop to succeed. Our consultant is the best!  I honestly don't know what we would do without him.
We feel like we got a college education with Management Success.  We learned every facet to running a business, from Sales, to Marketing, Finance, Operations, and Management and it actually cost a lot cheaper than my kids’ college education and they majored in one area.
We have also met a lot of shops through Management Success.  The best networking ever!  These people have become our friends and they are scattered all across the U.S.  Between the Management Success staff and these other shops, everyone is in this together as a family and we all do what we can to help each other. Amazing!! Changed our lives forever!  Truly Amazing!< /text>

<text>Management Success has helped me turn my body shop into a true success.  Before I consulted with them I was working a lot of hours with not much pay. In less than 3 years I doubled my gross sales, I hired additional people to do the jobs I was doing and now I concentrate on being the owner.  I'm now working about 40 hours a week and making more than twice as much as I was before my involvement with Management Success.  I can also pick up and leave without worrying about the business.  Thank you Management Success for helping me turn my life around.  Mark Probst owner of Probst Auto Body.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

When our business was originally contacted by Management Success a few years ago, we were at a point where we needed to completely change our methods, or shut down and look for jobs. Numbers were down, spending was up, and there was no "leader" allowed to make day to day decisions. Everything that the MS representative talked about on our phone conversation rang all too true. We are a partnership collision facility equally owned by 3 non-related individuals. The investment that we made in Management Success was the last straw for our company, a huge financial risk. After going to a seminar in our state hosted by MS, we decided on the spot that this was do or die. This was not easy, because we could barely pay ourselves or our vendors anything, let alone take this huge risk. Our spouses were with us at the seminar and helped us take the leap. I have always been the "dreamer" of the group, and I have always seen what we could be, but I didn't have the tools I needed to take us there. Top that with the guilt of changing my partner's lives forever by opening a business at the head of a recession, and with no clue as to what lay ahead. Now skip forward to present day, two years of help from MS and a couple years on our own with the training and methods in full use. We have a leader (Me the dreamer).We are run by the numbers, not by emotions. We have policies in place that are enforced and rewarded. We hire only high toned employees and remove anyone that brings the shop tone down. We have developed our own market advertising group with other local businesses to share advertising costs, have joined a BNI group, and have started a women's empowerment group with 25 other local businesses with a female owner. (One of our owners is a female). We have given back to our community and surrounding area and have been repaid with a growing client list. We have not worked in our back shop for well over 2 years and do all scheduling, planning, and direction from the front in writing. Questions and info from the back, in writing. If you can picture your ideal business, all you need are the tools and support to get there. We have 3 technicians in the back, owners in the front, work lined up for weeks, delivery dates met or exceeded, and the most online reviews of any collision facility within 300 miles. Our sales have exceeded half a million dollars this year and continue to climb. Reserves in the bank could carry the shop for months with no additional income. We as owners have taken a substantial raise and our employees have been generously compensated for their commitment to speed and quality. We have outlived our original bank that had told us we would never make it.(They folded 2 years ago, I think we were the only ones paying our mortgage). We offer benefits, and a well-structured high-toned place to work. This would not have happened if we did not have MS to guide us. So a huge thank you to my friend Ari Cohen, and the team at MS! If you are reading this and have not come to a decision about your shop, but are in the same situation we were a few years ago, call me. I will talk to you as a shop owner who used to be an employee in his own company. If you work this program, and use the tools provided, along with the support of many shops and experiences across the country, you will become the owner, and you will have success! Call me. Seven 1 five, five 7 one, One zero 6 0.< /review>

My wife and I learned of Management Success in our 6th year of business and I knew we needed help or we were through! We had plenty of business, that was not the problem, I just had no sanity left in my life, the shop fridge was always stocked with many "cold ones!" Within a year of signing up my wife and I went to the Florida Keys for a week, our first vacation since opening and I did not call the shop once the whole time...and it survived, in fact it did a little better than when I was there!

That was in 1996 & 1997, these guys are real help, a lifesaver and I trust them fully still today!< /text>

My husband was a great mechanic/technician, and he worked really hard!  But with having young children at home, he was working very long hours and not getting to spend any time with our family.  He was a one-man show doing everything from working on vehicles to answering phone, dealing with customers, ordering parts, and doing paperwork.  He went to a seminar put on by Management Success and figured he would go back and put his 36 pages of notes into practice.  But then he got overwhelmed with all the info and no real direction to be pointed.  When things were at their worst with sales only being about about $4000-$5000 per month (yes, I said month), he HAD to do something different!  That's when he took me to another seminar, I also saw the potential, and we got on board and got the help, support and direction we needed.  With the help of a consultant acting as an advisor and business partner (so to speak), we were able to get a lot of things put in place to work properly and efficiently and got sales up to around $750,000.  And not only do they have really good information and know what they're doing, they are all really nice people and friends now!  Our shop would not still be open today if it wasn't for their help!<//Text>

I have just about spun myself into the ground reviewing 2015 for my shop.  On this last day of the year, I felt absolutely that I owed you a look at what I'm referring to.  From January to June 17th my shop had grossed $174,170.00.  From June 18th when you became my guide and mentor through December 30th, we ran $360,695.00.  That is a total of $535,000 for the entire year!!  The previous year we ran $371,000 for the year which is a $164,000 gain for 2015.  There is a clear connection to the change that took place when you became my business coach Gloria!  The reason is YOU!  I could not possibly have been this successful without your insight & direction!  I believe in giving credit where credit is due & you are due much respect & praise!  You have assisted me in personal growth & motivating my employees to work harder & understand the direction I plan to take my business to.  I didn't possess this ability on my own & I owe you a debt of gratitude for all that YOU helped me & my business achieve!  This year ends today, but because of your persistence I look forward to seeing what 2016 holds!< /review>

I started my business in 1985 as a 1 man shop. I grew to add employees and move to another building, but this created more problems than benefits. I started with MS - had health problems and reluctance to change, so I did not benefit from all of my opportunities. We built a new building and now are a 10 person shop that is busy and profitable. Much work still needs done, however, MS and all of their team gets the credit for bringing me out of the dark ages. they have done everything they told me that they would do. MS has helped me to change financially and personally, to see possibilities instead of problems. We look forward to a long future with them as our shop needs arise.< /Text>

Management Success is an incredible company. They really care about their clients. They truly empower independent automotive repair shop owners with the business tools that they need to succeed. My shop, Knockout Collision Repair, is a good example of steady growth in a "bad economy". We did this by applying what we learned from Management Success.

Sincerely,
Kareem Abouzeid

<review>I first started using Management Success in 1995. The business operation technology they teach is outstanding. Using the things I learned I was able to turn a 2 bay service station barely breaking even into a fully operational 3 bay repair shop that sold and allowed me to open my dream shop a ten bay service facility with white heated floors, a warm welcome lobby, a highly skilled and well trained staff, and a great customer base. We are servicing approximately 100 cars per week and growing. Management Success has helped with everything from "how to sell" and "shop flow" to transitioning marketing to today's internet, web based "let your finger's do the walking" world.
Warm Regards and Thank You

<text>What a trip.  After hiring this firm for consulting, attending several training classes and conventions, I have grown from a one man shop doing $135,000/year to 4 employees with annual sales around $600,000.  All in less that 3 1/2 years.

Best decision I ever made ! RJ is the man , My shop is running smooth and Im making money !! When they said to me "get your tool box out of the shop you will make more money" I thought they were nuts but turns out they were right, who knew ? I have never been more relaxed and stress free . Work smarter not harder thats my motto.  I had a choice try and figure it out on my own or sign up and learn from the best !</text>

i joined management success 2 years ago,we had opened in 1999
my shop had many ups and downs and we had our share of employee issues and many times just poor communication on my part,
thru the training i am recieving the shop is improving and i am now able to start to relax some from the stress and worry due to having the proper training to find the right people to employ....
The staff and management team are awesome,
i always leave re energized and ready to apply the lessons taught at each class.
my consultants are always available to me and the management team is on top of the program..
i definitley recommend this business to other shops that are wanting to improve their shop
Five stars for sure</text>

<Date>1560006787967<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>When my husband plucked the Management Success! , (now Drive) flyer out of the trash and signed us up for their seminar back in 1996, he had spent the previous thirteen years being a self-employed automotive technician .  He was a great mechanic but in spite of his college education, did not know a whole lot about being a business owner.  Being a technician, he was accustomed to fixing things himself.  It was a life changing moment for us when he realized that he needed help to fix our business.  Luckily for us ,we turned to Management Success/ Drive and obtained the help and we needed to own a successful automotive repair business.  We attended the seminar, and subsequently signed up for the Workshops and Personal Consulting Package.  MS! / Drive taught us how to manage our business by tracking key statistics  and graphing changes to determine the condition in all areas of our shop including sales & marketing,  finance, production, quality control, public relations, administrative planning and executive planning.  We learned the exact actions needed to improve and eliminate undesirable conditions and maintain and strengthen desirable conditions.  The powerful combination of the "hands on training/ drills"  acquired at the workshops along with the guidance of our "personal consultant" gave us the skills we needed to successfully apply the MS! /Drive technology in our business.  These tools along with the most caring, highly trained consultants, skilled workshop instructors, and competent support staff are what sets MS!/Drive apart from all those other consulting companies.  We were so pleased with the results from the MS! /Drive program that we have used them for other training and services over the years, including our website design and SEO management.  It has all been fantastic!  The bottom line here is  MS!/Drive was able to transform a struggling self-employed automotive technician into a successful automotive shop OWNER.  That is the big difference.   We went from having no money, no time, no family life to having money in the bank and lots of time for eachother and our four children.   It is this huge improvement in the quality of our family life that we are most thankful to MS! /Drive for helping us achieve. Thank you MS!/Drive</text>< pictures>

Our family owned shop was purchased in 1990. We always seemed to be busy, but the profits were low and the hours long. Gross sales ran in the 300-400K range annualy. After 1 year of consulting with Management Success anual gross sales were at 900K, and my time was spent running the business, not turning wrenches or writing service. There will always be new challenges in this business, but we now have the tools and help to overcome any obstacle in our way.You cannot afford not to have this service. A shop without a gameplan is not a business, it is just a job!<//Review>

Our business reached a plateau in which we were not sure on how to move forward.  Over time I joined multiple steering and advisory committees to try to find the answer we were searching for. What I found is that everyone was looking for the same answers and with no results. In March my wife and I attended a Management Success seminar in Pittsburg and decided to give it a try. Since then we have attended two workshops and are going to be attending advanced classes. As of July 1st,  for the first time in Thirty years we are closed on Saturdays. How awesome is that!  Just this week we hired on an Assistant Service Writer and began  interviewing for an additional Tech. For the First time ever we are building a reserve account to be used for future growth.  When I was first introduced to my consultant,  RJ, his first words to me was" I will either be your best friend or your worst nightmare". Well, needless to say, RJ has become a friend. RJ pushes me hard, but for all the right reasons. I have never worked so hard on our business as I do now. My wife and I are on a 2 year program, I can honestly say it will be hard to say goodbye when it ends. My only regret is I wish we would have found Management Success earlier in my career.< /Review>< pictures>

I came to Management Success very reluctant. I had used several consulting companies in the pass and all had left a bitter taste in my mouth to say it nicely. However my sister January ( and yes that’s her name ) is my partner in our shop and she was impressed with what Management Success had to offer,  --- I was not buying any of it. --- However
much as sister and wife’s are, I lost out on the vote and we join Management Success,
I was not one of their ideal clients and fought them the whole way. I have to give them credit they were relentless and stayed on me to make the changes that we / I needed to make. They took a dumb old wrench twister and taught me, --  that’s right they taught “me” how ( kicking a cussing ) and turned me into a business owner. We went from a 3 man ( one woman ) operation making $10K a week and broke, -- to a 3 A -Technician 2 Service Writer shop, with me completely out of the shop  (  and 1 woman in charge )  making $30K + a week – Is that better !!!!  ---  And YES they can even take a wrench twister like you ( or your brother / husband / wife  ) and make business owners out of them!!

I am writing this review on behalf of Vic Andrushko - Owner of Crashpad Collision Services located in Parksville British Columbia, Canada.

Management Success was instrumental in helping us grow our business on a solid foundation of knowledge and support. Since joining Management Success we have expanded our business, we have moved to a larger location due to the increased volume of work, and now have joined the Fix Auto Group Franchise. None of this would have been possible without the excellent support provided by Management Success!

Horrible customer service the girl that answers the phone is rude and gave me a hard time " I'm just trying to place a simple order how hard is that" and it sounds like she hates her job. Furthermore based on this alone I would not recommend this place to anyone until they hire professional customer service representatives to take orders through the phone.<//text>

This is a very delicious place! I love going here with friends because it is a fun environment to be around. My favorite part about this place is the fact that the people that are serving you are super nice hilarious, and can make anything fun. The food is super amazing because they offer a variety of things. I especially like the teriyaki that they give at the Teriyaki House, for example the teriyaki bowls, but they also have sushi. I love this place so much. My favorite part about this place is that it is extremely local.</text>

Very delicious food. Very much worth the money, I would suggest getting the bento boxes if you’re starting out over there and work up to sushi or get both lol! Either way the sushi was definitely worth it and the bento boxes had very good portions not to mention the staff being pretty nice people. Would definitely comeback with different options or seconds! 🥰</text>

Take out does take long bits it’s reasonable, and yummy.  They have increased prices about dollar and half more.  New menus supposed to be printed in Jan 2021 to go.  Will see cause they’ve never had to go menus!<//Review>

Overall, the environment was friendly, the food was decent, and the prices were great.

The menu prices of the Rolls are what makes this restaurant appealing. The Rolls are not the most beautiful or aesthetically pleasing I have had. That is probably why the prices are lower than other Sushi restaurants. Also, I understand owners want to cut down on costs, but I prefer chopsticks that will not give me splinters.

From my first trip at Teriyaki House I have come to the conclusion that this is not a high quality restaurant, but merely a place to get your quick fix of delicious Rolls. This is not the place for the ultimate Sushi dining experience.</review>

I’ve been to many sushi spots around California and I can honestly say. Teriyaki House is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant. Found this place in Highschool. And many years later I still cant get enough. The staff is super friendly and helpful.   I recommend their Shrimp tempura, Juliana Roll and Salmon tempura.< /Review>< resp>

The man taking orders has a huge heart. Anytime i visit this place with my family he goes out of his way to make my daughter happy. The sushi is fantastic also. Mexican roll is amazing as is the Vegas roll. I do not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. I encourage it.

My only gripe about this place is that they got rid of the fried chicken dinner. LOL. Yes i know, who goes to a sushi place for fried chicken, well me. Im fat....so what.....

VISIT THIS PLACE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2904acf10f7e5:0x5625df5844019888< /gmapID></record>

The roll was fine with acceptable size and portions. I love that they provided the better chop sticks that are rounded and not the cheapies like Panda Express.

The ramen...while not bad, it's more Korean than Japanese. Cabbage, shrimp, and noodles noodles, no egg, scallions, bamboo, nori or anything I expect to see in Chinese or Japanese ramen. The noodles appeared to the de-fry-drated variety rather than fresh or air dried.

So the question, would I go back? To try more sushi, yes. For the ramen, no, I can make better at home.< /Text>< Pics>

I feel at home the service is a humbling experience. The owner Duke is funny and is always in a good mood. My fav rolls are Alaskan, Mexican and The Hungry Man is a Must! Thank you Teryaki House for being so affordable and close to Home in San Fernando, Ca.</review>

Overall good place for sushi. The rest of the food they sell I wouldn't try looks old but the sushi is fresh and inexpensive. Only thing perhaps is the wait I waited over half an hr for my Togo over and I choose Togo because the place is small there's only room for a few small tables. They don't have menus to take home so u have to show up and look at the menu to order. Their thai tea is standard. The waiter seemed very nice but the owners wife seem to be quite unbearable.He on the other hand was nice and spoke Spanish to his helper.</Review>

<Review>Went for dinner for my sons birthday and the food tasted good, but the rolls fell apart easily. It seems they are not rolling them tight enough.  After we finished our $35+ meal and were ready to go, I asked for a cup of water to go since I never received one while dining and the owner said he could not give me a cup to go. He said he only had cups for dine in only. I was never given any water while dining in and was only thirsty after I finished and was ready to go. This kind of poor customer service will not have me return again. The paper cups might cost his establishment $0.10 and he could not give me a cup of water and prefers to lose a paying customer over $0.10. Smh!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>2< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Double charged credit card, it should've been 32.50$ but instead got charged $63.72. Lagged on our spicy ramen. DON'T. COME. WITH. CREDIT. CARD. COME. WITH. CASH.<//Text>

They sell the spicy seafood ramen for $5.99 but I saw them opening a pack of Instant ramen and put in the seasoning. You can buy that at an Asian market for $1. Also no tofu in the miso soup. Overpriced as well.</review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Perfect, the food, very rich, but I do not like to close at 8:00 pm, we were my family and we were not allowed to eat there because they close at 8:00 pm, and it was barely 7: 10 pm, and just to go, I would give the 5 stars when they close the wings 9:00 pm ,,

<text>Started off to the 3 different playgrounds. Took a walk around the trail to the bottom diamond fields. Walked back up I was with family members, we had a wonderful time. Different people exercising their freedoms at this wonderful history of a park. The garden class is awesome. Maybe next time. Recommend this park to anyone. People are so alive at this park. The energy it brings is refreshing. Nice golf course. Such a professional landscape. Good work in taking care of the People.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Great park. They have so many different play areas for kids, it's amazing. On a gorgeous day like it was April 11th, there are so many options for kids. Lots of grassy areas too. The park looked very clean too. It was a good day<//review>

This is another place where my dogs can run and have fun Oh course I have to watch these two girls close, they are chalets so they are not user friendly.
The scenery is spectacular Mountains surrounding you. Clean Air everywhere.
God is so great in His creation.< /review>

Best walking park in the area.  I say this knowing there is another fantastic park very close but that one is better for hiking.
Paths that go through the park. Bathroom near soccer/football field or by indoor gym are the cleanest. Lots of pavilions and toys for kids. One playset is made for kids with disabilities.  Also one of the best pools. My daughter swam there five years.  Great free teams.  Classes for all ages and really cheap, but good.  Also they have great nighttime summer programs.  Highly recommend.  Lots of amenities. Baseball, soccer, football fields, tennis courts, indoor/outdoor basketball courts, horse shoe, pool, recreation center and right next to cheap golf course.  Lots of walking skate boarding bike riding paths.  Very busy on holidays and weekends for birthdays.</Review>

El Cariso park is part of the Sylmar triumvirate.

"Sylmar" means "Sea of Trees", and this park proves why. Acres and acres of wide grassy areas punctuated by beautiful old trees.

Among other things, this place has our dog-cooling area for hot days, a police station, and also is our emergency shelter center.

Again, don't tell anybody. This is our secret.</review>

You can have carne asada, eat, exercise, run and even swim if the pool is open. It has tennis courts as well. You can even walk a mile, half of mile or a quarter of a mile. I had a good time with my family. The park is located next to a community college.<//review>< user_id>

This is a very family friendly park with lots of activities for kids. They have movie night in the park. It's safe and the police are present but not overbearing.

The park has a swimming pool and tennis courts. There are soccer fields and an outdoor track. I feel safe being out at the park even at night.<//review>

<Text>Great park to bring family and friends. There are a ton of different recreational opportunities here; you can play handball at the wall, play basketball at the numerous courts, run or jog on the routes mapped out, or even go for a swim at the pool. It may get full of people on the weekends, but for those that get there early it isn't much of a problem. Lots of room for lots of fun!<//Text>< pictures>

It is a clean and safe park. It has a community garden which my boyfriend and I found and are now members of. We will start planting in our little garden soon. There's also a pool and a beautiful walk way for an evening stroll.</text>

This is a big park. There are lots of picnic tables. The bathrooms are small but have running water and soap in them. It's a nice place for a picnic if you're in the area.</text>

<Review>I go here for the birria hands down the best around if you like spicy ask for the special sauce they have in back. If your a weenie dont try it it might be too intense for some. Hand made tortillas and great service over all love going here.</Review>< pictures>

<time>1412568420585<//time><rating>5<//rating><text>restaurant is consistently good. It is a 5 mile drive for us and worth every foot. We ate there this morning. I had huevos  rancheros. They were outstandingly flavorful. If you like authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place.

Parking can be problematic. This morning we had to walk two and a half blocks. Still worth it though.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Good food the coffee is really strong, but the quesadillas are delicious because they are made with hand made tortillas. It's a small place and busy but the birria is good.< /Review>

Just discovered birria here, and love it! The goat meat soup, with the most yummy dark broth imaginable, came with an assortment of condiments and a huge stack of soft, chewy, piping hot tortillas.</review>

A perfect bit of Mexico.  Fresh tortillas on demand are the bomb.  The chilaquiles verdes are my breakfast favorite.  I don't know what Ryan Ausanka-Crues (of course look at his photo) was sayin' about the beans... they're beans... simple and very good, and the fresh tortillas are the real deal.  Wait staff always smiling is a plus.</Review>

Birria at 7:48 on a Tuesday morning? Menudo with fresh tortillas and lots of onions? Taquería González has you covered. I come for the tortillas, usually made while I order, and one of the stews. On each table is a service container holding onions and bright cilantro, a molcajete full of oregano and dried chilies, then another with lime slices, three kinds of salsa in squeeze bottles, and a bucket of rich, oily, nutty mole. This morning, the tortillas, were too hot for me to touch when they arrived at the table. The birria de chivo is sound but not complex. With lime and onions and chilies to taste, you have a delicious filling for a fresh tortilla. There was a re-run of Mexico playing Panamá on the T.V. today, but no one was really watching; everyone was too interested in their food.<//text>

The birria tacos were ok but the goat soup here lacked flavor and extremely bony . And pretty expensive I'd say compared to other places I've been.< /Text>

Yo fui y compre un super burrito y me dieron una chimichanga, estava bien de sabor pero Mal hecho con tortillas de hacer spring rolls, soy visitante y en la ciudad donde yo vivo los super burritos son super burritos no chimichanga, por ese Motivo Les soy una estrella, no le roben a la clientela con la comida, uno paga por lo que quiere comer no lo que le quieren dar.<//review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) It is good but what I did not like about that place is that the one who grabs the tortillas is with the phone in his hand and then takes out the tortillas and does not wash his hands is something that is not organic, you have to be more careful with food .

(Original)
es buena pero lo que no me gustó de ese lugar es que la que ase las tortillas esta con el teléfono en la mano y luego saca las tortillas y no se lava las manos es algo que no es igenico tiene que tener mas cuidado con los alimentos.<//review>

I love 99 cent only stores but the manager at this place screams unprofessional! Everytime I come in, he's either talking down to employees or giving someone an attitude. Today, he was in the front area of the store literally on his phone on a personal call being loud as ever. I just feel bad for who ever has to take him seriously as a boss.<//Text>

<text>My son needed to use the restroom so we had to ask twice for the code to the bathroom and both times someone was supposed to be coming. No one came. While we were waiting there we heard a few people in the employee room next to the restroom I heard people in there. I knocked and asked if they could open the door for my son so he could use the restroom and no one answered it also got quiet in the room. Moments later the door opened and a man by the name of Ivan walked out in regular clothing. I asked him if he heard me knocking and he said, "yep" when I said why weren't you able to open the restroom he said, "i don't know" and I said well that's rude you weren't allowing a child to use the restroom for your own selfish reasons. Be then said, "I don't give a f**k" and continued walking to the front of the store. Clearly, this worker has NO customer service guidelines, and needs to be retrained again with the proper procedure on handling a customer. Very unprofessional of ALL the employees to leave a CHILD waiting to use the restroom. My basket of items was left right at the door, and I DO NOT plan on returning.<//text>< Pics>

The store is a great place filled with shelves with merchandise for all needs. However management has made poor decisions and placing management over its employees and customers. From the manager Jose who look completely lost to the manager with a blonde and black roots, stubby who is sour with life. She gives off an unwelcomed, facial expressions, vibe, and rudeness to the customers. At one point we got into an argument so she waist and slammed one of my rock stars causing it to burst and make a disaster in my bag with my merchandise. Your customers deserve better service if you want us to continue shopping there!!!<//text>

I usually come here when I want to buy stuff for camping, however the night shift manager was absolutely disrespectful, there was a homeless man behind me asking for just 10 cents so he can afford his food.. after I paid for my stuff I  wanted to pay for his food instead of just giving him 10 cents (mind you, he wasn’t bothering anybody and just asked me only for 10 cents he wasn’t even begging like that). The manager that was working at register 1, told me that I couldn’t pay for his food and that “he has it” looking down at the counter as he was struggling to count his change to make sure he had enough, I told the manager that I’m going to pay for it regardless and I slide my card, HOW pathetic and disrespectful you guys have for a night manager! Who is she to tell me what I can and can not do! I don’t care if she sees him on a daily basis and knows him more than me if I want to do something that’s none of her business! Very insensitive and how is this customer service? Was it possible discriminating? Against this man?!</Text>

I can usually find what I need.Lines are horribly long. Some cashiers have no customer service qualifications at all. So today is the 3rd of Aug 2017, I just came from store...I was WOWed by the appearance,it was clean neat, i still didnt get a "how are you?" but it was very nice and clean,the line was actually small,thank you for listening.<//review>

My Aunt was celebrating her 89th birthday.  I wanted to do something special for her.  So I contacted Marin Floral Studio.  They provided my aunt with, in her own words, an "absolutely gorgeous bouquet".  She went on and on about how beautiful it was.  Thank you for making her birthday special.  I will definitely be using you again!</text>

Catherine's floral arrangements are gorgeous, a work of art. She is so pleasant to work with and her customer service is superb! I'm so glad I found her in Marin and I highly recommend her!<//Text>

I called Marin Floral Studio from out of state and requested a bouquet they featured on their site. Their work is beautiful and they far exceeded my expectations. My friend was thrilled by the bouquet and the flowers included in it (her photos). Marin Floral is very responsive and does work as beautiful as the pieces featured on their site. Highly recommend!< /text>

There is no question but that Catherine of Marin Floral Studio is a master floral artist!  She and I had a very nice conversation as I was ordering a floral arrangement for my son and daughter-in-law and their family for Easter.  I live in Ohio and they live in Marin County.  I knew from looking at the website that the floral arrangements are pretty spectacular, but I wasn't prepared for the beauty of seeing the arrangement in person!  I saw it several days after it was delivered.  It was perfect, still looked fresh (and did 10 + days after!)   The selection of flowers and accents Catherine used were amazing.  And my daughter-in-law said it was the most beautiful floral arrangement she had ever seen or received.  I know who I'm going to use to brighten the day of my loved ones from now on.  This is the way flowers are supposed to be...vibrant, fresh, gorgeously presented.  Thank you, Catherine for the joy you brought to my family!</Text>

Catherine helped me choose a plant for my friend's birthday and created and delivered a very lovely arrangement with orchids and succulents. My friend, who lives in Terra Linda, was happy with the gift and charmed by Catherine as well!  She said she now knows where to order flowers in her neighborhood.<//review>

I am very impressed and I will always go to Marin Floral for any of my floral needs. I Highly recommend it!! Catherine Miller is genuine, sweet and very kind. I could tell that she loves her job and she makes every arrangement with love. Thank you so much Catherine!! I can't wait to do business with you again!

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I spent the better part of two hours pouring through reviews to try to find the best florist local to my mother to send her some flowers. I am so lucky that I found Marin Floral Studio! After striking out with a few different florists (unreasonable surprise fees tacked on at the end, poor reviews, and unreliable service), I was SO relieved to call Marin Floral Studio and speak with the actual woman who would be preparing my mother’s arrangement. She was polite and professional and walked me through all the specifics of my order. On top of that, her pricepoint was better than anywhere else I looked (which does not make sense for the level of quality she delivered). My mum received her flowers the same day I ordered them and they were absolutely gorgeous. I still cannot believe I was able to send her such a nice surprise at such a reasonable price. I wish all of my family was local to San Rafael so I could support this business more often!

If you’re shopping around for the best option, look no further. You’ve found it.< /Review>< Pics>

Catherine was absolutely amazing! I was so extremely happy with the flowers at my wedding. Catherine was one of the first florist I reached out to and immediately she was so kind and listened to everything that I wanted. I met her at my venue and you can tell she is an expert in flowers. I told her my color scheme and shared her my Pinterest board of ideas I liked and let her do her thing and she just nailed it! I had a budget and she stayed within it, and any changes I asked for she did it. My bridal bouquet was so perfect and I could not have been happier how it turned out. I would 100% recommend Marin Florist to anyone looking for a florist for their wedding.</text>

Excellent quality and service. Our flowers have stayed fresh a good while. Relatively expensive but maybe worth it.<//Text>

Had a floral emergency and had to send flowers to a very special friend / Covid bride ASAP. I'm across the country and found Marin Florist through a google search and was impressed with images on website. Left an after hours message explaining what I needed, and received an almost immediate text from the owner that she would take care of it in the AM. We spoke at 7am and she understood immediately what I needed, and delivered the most gorgeous, stunning, extravagant arrangement to the bride right as she was getting her makeup done early that afternoon. Have received many positive comments from people who saw it - and the bride loved it. VERY impressive customer service! For reference, that is a $150 arrangement. Truly a work of art! Turned out just as I hoped it would!<//review>

I recently had the pleasure of working with Catherine (from a distance) to arrange a delivery for a friend that was recovering from an illness and in the hospital.  For a number of days, Catherine patiently held on the delivery of the order until I could confirm that our friend had been finally discharged home.  This took several days but in the end, our friend received a beautiful and fresh Orchid plant with fresh flower stems, just as I had ordered.  Thank you for your professionalism and patience Catherine!  ~Patty Kiddoo</Text>

Catherine of Marin Floral Studio made a gorgeous arrangement for me and delivered it the very same day.  Her arrangements, in addition to being fresh and beautiful, are a great value.  Just the week before the most recent time I ordered flowers from Marin Floral studio, I ordered an arrangement from Adelaide's in La Jolla, San Diego's most old-school fancy flower shop.  The flowers I got from Adelaide's were fine, but were more expensive and less interesting than those from Marin Floral Studio.</review>

I called to order flowers for a family friend’s son who had passed away. I rarely order flowers and was stuck on what to order, what to say and didn’t even know what I wanted or what to ask for.  The lady on the phone put me at ease and told me she had just been to the market that morning and that she would put together a lovely piece for delivery. First she asked me If there was a budget I wanted to work with which  I really appreciated. She also made some suggestions since I really didn’t know what to say. She added a light to a dark and somewhat awkward situation. She was very respectful, kind and easy to talk to. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. It’s not often you come across people who you can tell have a heart of gold over the phone . Unfortunately, I don’t remember the woman’s name, but if she ever reads this....Thank you!

<text>Katherine did a superb arrangement at the last minute for Mother’s Day. My sister loved it! I live in Oregon and she made me feel like I was right nearby. She’s the best—artistically and so caring.< /text><Time>1526852131136<//Time>< user_name>

Sent flowers to my sister on her first Mother's Day after the passing of her son.  Catherine was so compassionate and caring, and that definitely came through in the arrangement my sister received.  The flowers were absolutely exquisite!!!  I just can't say enough!  Thank you, Catherine!!< /Review>

Catherine created a unique and lovely corsage for my son's prom date. Interacting with Catherine was a pleasure. She is responsive, creative and fairly priced. I will definitely be contacting Catherine at Marin Floral for my future floral needs.<//review>

<name>Rebecca Bennett<//name><Text>This past Saturday I was looking for a florist who could deliver to a memorial service the next day, but I couldn't find anyone open on a Sunday until I called Marin Floral. Catherine answered, and we discussed what I wanted. She was very knowledgeable, and within a few minutes, I had ordered an arrangement. When I walked into the venue, someone had placed the flowers on a piano, and they were so bright and lovely! As it so happened, they were the only flowers there, and I was very pleased at how beautiful the room became with their presence. I highly recommend Marin Floral. The next time you want to send flowers, call Catherine!</Text>< user_id>

She has an innate ability to combine colors and textures in such a way that they become true works of art.  Her Monday arrangements look just as lovely on Friday and often she has something in the bouquet that will pop out as the days goes on.
I would use her in a heartbeat if I was having a personal event.  She is courteous, reliable and very efficient.  She is a true talent.</text>< Pictures>

I have only recently met Catherine and already don’t know what I would have done without her! I called her with less than two weeks to spare for a 50th anniversary party for my in laws! She made me feel calm, like we had plenty of time, she didn’t rush me, we chatted over the course of a few days before making final plans. She helped me come up with a perfect design, was there early to help set up, was always available to discuss the party, and kept well within our budget. The centerpieces she creates were stunning!! I have already referred her to several people and more will ask, I’m sure!! Thank you, Catherine, for being an integral part in making this special night perfect!<//Text>

I just went into the store today. The manager is extremely rude and has no manners. She was treating  the customers In a horrible way. I’m extremely upset, and I hope it doesn’t happen to anyone else again.<//text>

They should provide discount when I used my Visa credit card of Bank of Communication China, but the cashier boy said that there was not discount with any cards. Jesus, the prompt is right outside ur door. Check out the activities you are holding and train your staffs better okay? Shame on you!</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>District attorney should pursue for discrimination against race on quantity purchase.  Wasting our time to select clothes and manager said there is a limit quantity on purchase without  even able to produce the real company written policy. The two so called managers of the store should not be there if cannot do their job properly.  You dont deserve our business forever. Good bye.</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Everything is made in China. I do not say that I use pure Italian brand, only that it should be cheaper not at the price they sell it ... very expensive to be made in China.

Todo es hecho en China. No digo que yo uso pura marca italiana, solo que debería ser más barato no al precio que lo venden... muy caro para ser hecho en China.< /Review>

<Text>They are great! Wonderful communication and easy to work with. Booking an appointment is easy thanks to their super nice office staff! My partner and I have had our windows tinted by them twice. Best prices, best service. I can’t recommend them highly enough and we will keep taking our vehicles to them.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Great custom auto shop for auto detailing and window tinting! top-notch service for affordable prices. I can't recommend them highly enough. The first time I came to their shop was a couple of years ago when I first moved to the area and ever since they have been very helpful.

<Text>WOW! What a great auto shop! They got my car in and out for window tinting and leather repair. I’m quite impressed by the quality of their work and their fair prices. I would use them again the next time I need auto detailing and I recommend you to do the same.<//Text>< rate>

<Review>I like cleaning my car on a regular basis but once a month I take it to Conejo, they always do a great job and leave my car good as new! They are the best auto detailing shop in the area. Their crew is super friendly and know what they're doing. I can't recommend them highly enough. This is definitely a 5 star company!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>I wanted to get a complete interior and exterior auto detailing service and found Conejo in the area. I called in to inquire about their availability and prices and they were able to fit me in their schedule right away. Great customer service, amazing result and the price was more than fair.

I've used them now for 4 different vehicles and each time their work and service have been fantastic. The first time I visited their shop was for window tinting and paint protection. What I like the most is their honest crew. No upselling, no games, just quality work, and quality materials for a fair price.</Text>

After reading all the positive reviews, I took my car to Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Malibu for repair.  I had a small dent in the driver's side door.  Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Malibu did a fantastic job repairing my car.  He had to repaint the entire door and the color match is perfect.  He worked quickly and I got a great price.  I will take all my auto body work to Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Malibu's in the future.< /review>

I want to recognize this business for their customer service and highly recommend it to everyone. If you are looking for a place to get your windows tinted don't go anywhere else. The guys from Conejo are the best! They offer high quality products and they have competitive prices! I’ve done my research so you don’t have to worry, just go straight to Conejo and thank me later!< /Text>

I highly recommend these guys. I wouldn't go anywhere else. I've had a couple of cars tinted by these guys and they always do a wonderful job! They are trustworthy and the quality of their film is great. I don't live in the area but it's worth the drive. I highly recommend these guys for window tinting.</Text>

<text>I called Conejo to do window tinting in our office and they did great. The sun is very intense during a few hours and it hits just the front of our offices so it was a little hard to stand it. I gave them a call and they promptly responded and in no time we had our appointment and they did the job perfectly! I highly recommend them</text>< Pics>

Excellent job applying window tinting on both of our Teslas. I highly recommend Conejo to everyone. I was given prompt and accurate information about their window tinting services and they were willing to answer every question and concern I had. I want to thank them again for all the hard work they do.</Text>

Conejo and their staff installed window tinting and detail my vehicle before our 2 month road trip! We want to thank the whole crew, they went above and beyond to make sure the job was done on time and we love the job they did.

I just got my windows tinted with these guys! I can tell you the service was great, the price was fair and everyone was very friendly. What more could you ask for? The best part is, the tint looks amazing! You can tell they only use high-quality tint.  It adds so much quality to my vehicle and keeps the heat out while also protecting my interior.<//Text>

I needed tints for my new car so like an elite online citizen I did my research. I found this place based on location and Google reviews.  It was just up the street from my house which was super convenient.  Contacted them through their website and got a really fast response. They gave me pricing and same day availability info.  I gotta say this was excellent customer service from the beginning.  Told them make and model of my car and then I was on my way there.  A member of their staff greeted me promptly and discussed tint color options. There is an inside waiting area with air condition and comfortable seating to wait there.  2 hours later and I was out of there on my way home.  Not too shabby for a Saturday morning. Super pleased with the quality as well  as the customer service.  Would definitely recommend their services!<//review>

What most caught my attention is that the Auto Detail Service at Conejo does not compare with another. They are so kind and fair with payments that when you see good service and good service, you even want to pay more. Incredible Tintings, my cars are luxurious! I couldn't choose better than Rabbit. More than grateful!< /text>

Two weeks ago my grandparents came to visit and I drove them around town. It was lovely. Except, they smoked in my car. I did not want to stop them because you know, I love them and they would not listen anyway. As soon as they left I took my car to Conejo to have it detailed. Those guys are great! My car feels soooo good now! I highly recommend.</Review>

A painter got overspray all over my moms car and we coordinated with Conejo Auto Detail Malibu to take it off. It just so happened that we scheduled the appointment on most likely the hottest day of the summer and they had it through early, worked hard, and did a really good job for a fair rate. My parents were very happy with the results and I will be bringing my cars to them for sure.<//Review>

<review>Conejo Window Tinting is the right place if you want your car to look amazing. The best price in the city and they are very professional. My oldest daughter recently graduated from high school and we gave her a car. It was not the time I wanted. The final result was great. It was a very fast job. I highly recommend Conejo Window Tinting. For future work I will return. I am now another satisfied client and my daughter is very happy.

Let me give you some valuable advice: go to Conejo Window Tinting and get your cars tinted there. Don’t waste your time and money going somewhere else: just go to Conejo Window Tinting. Trust me. I’ve tinted a lot of cars in my life since I have a car rental business and when I found these guys I decided to keep them. They always give me a fair priced, fast, efficient, and high quality service: whether it’s a tinting service or auto detail, they always deliver with excellency. Other businesses like this one usually just make excuses to deliver late, or deliver wrong. I have never been disappointed with these guys and I’ve been bringing them my cars for 5 years now. I first took one of my cars there for tinting and I was amazed by their great service and kind staff. I decided to take another car for the same service and same result. Same with auto detail. It’s just great.</Text>

It had been at least 5 years since I last had my car detailed, I called Conejo Auto Detail Malibu to get a quote on what I wanted to have done and their welcoming attitude really caught me so I decided to with them. They had my car ready on the same day I took it in and WOW! It looks so nice that I won´t go that long again before having it detailed, and for sure I will bring my cars to them from now on.< /text>

<review>Conejo Auto Detail Malibu is the absolute best detail shop.  I've been using them for years and will make the drive from L.A  have them work on my vehicles as long as they are around.  They are the people to trust with your car.  They are wizards when it comes to detail needs, including ceramic coating and whatever else you are thinking about.  They are also happy to take the time to give you honest opinions and share their knowledge about different products & processes.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I like to get my car detailed once a year, I used to go somewhere else but last year I was very unhappy with the service so I decided to go to Conejo this time. Not only they are closer to my office but they are also super friendly and professional! They did such a great job that I couldn't believe it! Thank you so much guys! I definitely recommend them and I’ll be coming back for sure!</Review>< time>

I have 2 French doors and I bought blinds to save money. The designer of my house suggested that applying window dye was a better option for a cleaner appearance. The window tinting is not cheaper than the blinds, however, I like to make it look better. I'm glad I chose them because it was a pleasure working with Conejo Window Tinting, who made an incredible window tint for me.

Top-notch work and professional attention to detail. At Conejo Auto Detail Malibu they have a trained eye for their work and they can identify any issues and recommend fixes for them, but they also go beyond that by letting you know how to take care of your car after it's out of the team's hands. We did a walkaround of my car (an Audi S3) and they quickly spotted problem areas and situations that he and his team would handle to get the car looking its best. I can say for sure that it looks much better than new after the work was done</review>

I work for a tourism agency and recently we acquired a fleet of mini vans. And once again I counted on the services of Conejo Window Tinting for the windows tinting of the trucks. The excellent service and professionalism with which this company deals with each job makes me always return to request their services. The work team always strives for all customers to get the best service. I will definitely refer anyone who needs window tinting to Conejo Window Tinting.<//Text>

< review>
I’m a contractor and recently did a huge remodeling in a house. We put a huge window facing the patio and the pool that looks great, but we needed to find a great residential window tinting service to keep my client's privacy. Our usual provider was unable to work for us at the time so I needed to find another reliable option quickly to stay on schedule. My assistant found about Conejo Window Tinting on google and we got a fast response, and they had great residential options, so we decided to hire them. They did a wonderful quality job, delivered right on time and it looked pretty great. This left my client very pleased with his windows and the team at Conejo Window  Tinting really saved us from a big delay. I  would absolutely call them again for another job because they were very professional and gave us a fair price.</review>

I just bought an SUV but it brought the glasses completely clear. Impossible to use with the heat of California! Of the companies that I called alone Conejo Auto Detail Malibu he offered me a detail of the materials and inking levels they handle. With all the information it was easier to decide. I was very satisfied with all the work they did in 2 hours, the guys were very thorough in their work and the installation was very well done. I noticed the other two cars that we have in the family and the inking looked already very discolored, so I will also take those to make the inking change. The truth is that I recommend them a lot.</Text>

Pro tip: Come early April and you may see cherry blossom without going all the way to Japan. We did

Pro tip2: To save a few bucks for the parking fee you could park across the street in the mall and walk in to the park.We didn't do that ;-)

We also got lucky and saw some Mexican/Indian celebration (Hope we got this right) so cool to see something that's authentic which they did it for themselves and not for tourism.< /review>

Beautiful park for an amazing walk/run/hike. Stream runs the length of the picnic areas and playgrounds. Plenty of green grass areas with shady big trees. But this park main attraction are all the great hiking trails and views.  Beware of bobcats, coyotes and rattlesnakes.< /text>

<review>Cool place for jogging,  hiking or just to relax under a pepper tree.
The only downside is that it is so littered. People should start appreciating this place and what it represents, when they start appreciating it, they'll start respecting it as well. There's more than just sloppy humans on this planet.< /review>< Resp>

I recently took my grandchildren and dog to play at this park. This was the park that their father used to visit when he was a little boy. Back then there were animals and a flowing river. I was so happy to see that it is still well maintained. They have 2 great playgrounds and several long winding trails. The park is wide, spacious and very inviting. My grandchildren want to visit again and at that we will have a nice picnic.</Review>

Very nice park to go for a run/walk. Just the thing that bothered me were the rocks on the trail but if you like that then go right for it. I went with my dad for the first time and we really enjoyed it. Really nice views too.</text>

<response>None</response><Review>Great place to take a minute to enjoy the outdoors with out going to far. Park goes all the way back to hills and a horse stable.  Looks private horses IDK if you can rent for trail rides. Still nice place for a walk or hike if you like.</Review>< rating>

A great park to walk around! Came here last week with my dog to view the cherry blossom trees and we weren’t disappointed! The main walking path was lined with dozens of sakura trees, and most of them were in full bloom. This park was spacious + clean, and visiting on a beautiful spring day made the experience even more special. 🌸

Parking: they do charge for parking, so if you don’t want to pay I recommend parking in the small shopping center next to the park.

*Note: this park does require everyone to wear masks! I thought that most people would be maskless but I was pleasantly surprised to see that 99% of the people I passed were wearing one 😊</text>

<Text>This really is a great park.  So many trails and beautiful hills.   Great place to go and disconnect.  The reason I removed a star is because I was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake.  Just be careful on the trails.  Walk in the center of the trail and look out.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Park with playgrounds, hiking trails for all levels, and horseback riding. You can park inside (paid) or try to find street parking along the neighboring areas. It’s located right across the Puente Hills Mall, so you can easily grab a meal or go shipping before/after being at the park. Public restrooms are available and still open during covid. Masks are required.

There are a lot of different trails you can take and there’s workout equipment like pull up bars available. Some of the hikes do get a bit steep, but there are family-friendly options. There’s also a cement path for those looking for a more flat surface. There’s not a lot of shade, so bring a hat and wear sunscreen. There are a lot of picnic tables and I noticed a lot of families/groups using them. There are snakes and mountain lions so be mindful. Overall, this park provides a great way to have access to nature even in the middle of the ‘burbs.</Review>< username>

<gmap_id>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d< /gmap_id><text>With the stay at home locked down ended yesterday, it’s the best time to go to parks to enjoy nature and soak up those much needed vitamin D to boost your immune system.

After the rain, the sky was extra blue and the air was so clear and fresh. Coming out to Schabarum regional park was the best decision. My wife and I heard that the stay at home locked down order had ended, we immediate decided to come to this park to catch the plum blossom before it’s too late.

This park is the only few of the parks in LA that have cheery and plum trees where they will blossom at the beginning of Spring. Without being able to go to Japan this year to view the Cherry blossom, this place is the closest thing.

It’s kind of interesting to know that in 1992, this park formed a sister relationship with Kairaku-En Park in Japan.

With the rain this week, the flowers are blossoming  with extra beauty. The colors of the flowers, white, red and pink blanketed the whole park. This scenery made you feel like you’re in Japan.

After gluttonous picture taking activities, we decided to hike up the hills to get some exercises. Once we get to the top, we were awed by the beautiful scenery of. The San Gabriel Valley. With the clear blue sky we can see all the way to the snowy top of Angeles Crest.

There are more to do in this park then just viewing cherry and plum blossoms. People come here to play soccer and tennis, picnic, hike, and horse back riding.

For the hikers, the trail here connects to the historic Juan Bautista De Anza National Historic Trail. There are plenty of parkings. Normally the fees for parking is $6. But during the pandemic, it seems that the parking is free. No body is at the gate to collect the fees.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<review>Very beautiful park. From cherry blossoms in the spring and hiking in the south end of the park, it’s well worth visiting. However, you have to pay for parking which can be rough, especially on weekends where it’s $5 and park may be overcrowded. But it’s very lovely driving inside the park once you get in.<//review>< name>

Good for a picnic. Restrooms were in good shape. Toilet seat covers, TP and foaming soap dispensers were well stocked on a Thursday in January 2021.</Review>

<Text>The Schabarum Skyline trail is truly one of a kind if you're looking for a variety of landscape for a jog, hike, or simply a walk. You can choose from a flat pavement to a more intense incline trail at a higher elevation. One thing I would note is this place have snakes and mountain lions which is typical in a vastness of grassland that considers to be a wilderness. It is advised to accompany with others if you decide to go on a wild hike. Also, there are horses that you can rent at the park if you want to have a wild experience.</Text>< pictures>

All cherry blossoms trees are donations from dr. Gu at Azusa in remembrance of their son who died in a hiking trip. They chose to turn grief into passion, the love of nature in a form of cherry blossoms which are enjoyed by so many people! While we are mesmerizing with its beauty, we always remember the pain that they went through. The pain of loosing a son who just graduated from university. We should cherish life and be grateful with each family member in our daily life!</text>< Pictures>

Great park feels like the wilderness...in the middle of the city. Hills, mountains, trails and trees 💜< /Text>

Been going three straight weekends Sunday. Been doing the .2.0 m trails that overlooks the park. Great workout,  and also has some machines for stretching  and the front entrance. No so crowded has bbq grills but so far have not seen anyone use it. I've eaten at the tables but thats about it. Has some drinking fountains and bathroom. But just bring your water bottles</Review>

<text>This place is amazing it has plenty of space for picnics. It has plenty of space for family or friends get together. It has beautiful hiking trails and if you want to know one of them leads to horses. Some of the restrooms are open so you need to pay attention to the sign in the entrance to see which ones are. People take their bikes here so if you want bring yours. If you want a park that has tranquility this is definitely the one for you! My boyfriend and I make this our twice a month adventure.< /text>< Pics>

Nice big park with lots of room to spread out and remain socially distant. Most people wear masks, at least when they get near other people which is also comforting. There is a lot to explore in the park, I just wish people would take better care of the park and pick up their trash. There is a lot of small pieces of litter in the park.</Review>

Great park with lots of places for picnics or barbecue. Several playgrounds for kids to play on too.  Spring time is a great time to come and take pictures among the blooming cherry trees. Free admission on weekdays and paid admission on weekends.< /Text>

Beautiful big park.  Friendly staff.  Always clean.  Great for parties. The best trails for walking or horseback riding.  Free parking on weekdays and late afternoon on weekends.The best time to go is after a big rain when the stream is full of water.  Bring your camera. You will want to get some pics.</text>

I head down at least once a week for my hike. Its lovely seeing the changing seasons throughout the year. From the park, you're able to see the changing foliage and cherry blossoms, and out on the trails, wildflowers bloom and give way to brush and the like. It's always a treat catching sight of all the wildlife on your way up as well. The trails aren't too daunting, and the park is large and lovely. Would highly recommend visiting with the whole family.< /text>

Loved walking the path toward the horse stables. People were pretty good about social distancing. Walked 4.5 miles!<//Review>

One of my favorite places in the San Gabriel Valley. Schabarum Park is the best way to "get out there" without really leaving suburban LA. There are miles of trails teeming with wildlife to be explored on foot, bike or horseback. Some trails are easy and popular with somebody always within eyesight. Others are more remote and it's easy to forget you're a few miles away from a mall. They do charge for parking on the weekends, so park across the street in the mall lot and walk over.<//Review>

This park is very large with plenty of parking for $6. Lots of land throughout this park with plenty of shade.lots of picnic tables and BBQ's. hiking trails for hikers and mountain bike riders. Also great for horses to take on this park with lots of terrain and hills throughout this area.great to bring the kids for gatherings and special occasions such as B-days or jus for families or friends to enjoy a little outdoor activities.lots of wildlife out here also. Be watchful for the kid's due to lots of cars coming and going throughout the day at this park.<//Review>

<Text>The park itself if beautiful, and also allows access to miles of wilderness trails into the hills.  The trails allow walking, running, biking, and horseback riding.  Trails are closed for two days after rains.  Passing signs that indicate the trails are closed can result in a citation with a fine.  The trails are beautiful all year long and provide many views of wildlife and the cities below.</Text>< pics>

Went on a weekend and there were lots of homeless people and trash scattered around the park (canned food, plastic wrappers, etc). The entry costs $6 per car. If you're paying to come here, I'd recommend you look for other regional parks in the area as they're more likely to be cleaner and be bigger</Review>

<Review>WOW! THIS PARK IS AMAZING!!!!!  Just being in this natural beautiful place is just a little slice of paradise in the LA county area. Who would've guessed this gem of a place would be tucked away so sweetly. I saw so many squirrels, rabbits, butterflies and so much more!

I will be back to take another relaxing nature walk.

Great trails up the hills with interesting climbs, for easy walking, mountain cycling and outdoor family fun. You will get a good exercise on this trail with great views.

Then come down and enjoy the greenery of the park if you want to do easy scooting rides, pushing baby prams with wide spacing to ensure everyone gets the exercising without crowding. Family enjoyed our outing here.<//review>

<Time>1517102407811< /Time><rating>1</rating><text>Got hint that there was cherry blossoms blooming around the time I went.  I guess I just missed it or something was astray. I saw one tree bloom but it was too small to make dent int the experience. So,I said hey how about the hiking trail. The trail is great for beginners but I found forks that had no map direction. The experience probably would have been better granted I didn't get charge to visit a park. I never heard of that until I came here. To rub salt in the wound, 30 mins later there no one was charging to park. I guess we drew the luck of the draw. Maybe , next time will be a better experience.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz64LbiXCYvnF3cBG3p3ne8fw_8PoEZ2e3TQhJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9ZEJ7LOmMS0YFTYEvxK9EzVWwugXW4Odmqsg5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBbQh6sm49f8St3kwaANwW_CXhQ7Si5ov8layz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgUJ2rHIMfuciNbH__NpgT9e0znpKYORDZygXq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdrISXqEDldoeZT436_8BOAy1-rbTyvuPFOCr0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZdCWaFs9oK5Fu41Hq-SGx9rXQ20v7slc5xNuF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb7Y3W7LjJBMaENiCLsx3yfg6DmqiHnKPqagnm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

We were here to see the cherry blossoms.  There aren't lots of trees but good enough to take some pretty pictures.  Weekdays are less people with no parking fee charged.  When you enter to the front entrance, you'll keep driving down until you see the horse ranch on the left.  That's where all the pretty cherry blossoms are.<//text>

Went there for cherry blossom but the big cherry blossom trees in the back of the park have no flowers. It's a wide park. Go there get sone fresh air, walking around see people and small cherry blossom trees are blooming.</review>

Safe place to hike during covid-19. Most people are cautious and wearing masks and social distancing. Great for getting adventurous hiking miles in the morning.<//Review>

I love bringing my dogs to this park. I get a long line and train my dog. It's pet friendly. Deeper into the park there is a trail I take my dogs to as well. It's free on the weekdays. On the weekends I park along a side street.</Review>

<Review>Any park with an exercise area AND a hiking trail is automatically dope. Not to mention that it's so pretty, and the view up top is fantastic. Hike, exercise, play tennis(!), or just chill and have a picnic, whatever you wanna do it's a great park for it.< /Review><Date>1519164265488< /Date>< username>

<name>Denise A< /name><resp>None</resp><text>This is a huge park. There are trails, abundance of picnic tables with grills, parking spots, public restrooms and grassy areas to choose from. Great for walking, jogging and biking. The signs say no drones and skateboards are allowed. This was a great spot to walk our dog, she sure loved it. Watch out for snakes and mountain lions in the hills/trails. Make sure to check out their dedicated butterfly and humming bird area sanctuary next to the amphitheater.<//text>< pictures>

Always busy but that's okay, this place is huge! Free parking during the week but pay for parking on the weekend...$7 if i remember correctly. To me, not worth the fee...stick to the weekdays.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Our second time visiting this park. I enjoyed it this time as much as the first. The park is huge and has different kid/pet friendly trails. Not sure if this Park is busy during Summer season will have to give that a try in a few months. Today's visit was awesome with our big family.  We were able to have the end side of the park all to ourselves. Highly recommend.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I'm only giving this place 1 star, and they are lucky to even get that. These silly people that run this park do not allow drones there, for what reason I don't know. Get over it people it's a form of photography and videography. You all that are against quadcopter's are watching to many movies,  If you think people are trying to spy on you when they are flying.

I'm only giving this place 1 star, and they are lucky to even get that. These silly people that run this park do not allow drones there, for what reason I don't know. Get over it people it's a form of photography and videography. You all that are against quadcopter's are watching to many movies,  If you think people are trying to spy on you when they are flying.  I'm guessing the people that are against drones are mad also or upset because they can't afford a drone, a nice drone I should say.  Save up!</Review>

Safe place to hike during covid-19. Most people are cautious and wearing masks and social distancing. Great for getting adventurous hiking miles in the morning.</Text>

Nice trails, a few playground areas, an exercise area, picnic areas, some informative signs about the animals, insects and plants along one of the paved paths and if you play pokemon go some stops and gyms with decent spawns along the paved paths< /Text>

Always busy but that's okay, this place is huge! Free parking during the week but pay for parking on the weekend...$7 if i remember correctly. To me, not worth the fee...stick to the weekdays.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I only go during the week as entrance to the park is free. They charge to go in with your vehicle on weekends. This park has a few trails that are fun to walk, run, or hike. Also has a ton of picknick areas with charcoal grills. Great for groups, kids and well, everyone.<//review>< Pictures>

We went hiking today. So many trails. Im sure it takes many trips to get to know this place. I recommend it. It might not look big from the street but this place is huge.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>This park is free to public during weekdays. The gate for vehicles to enter closes at about 5:30PM, so make sure to get there before that time. There are good amount of trails for people to wonder around, and some nice green lawns for people to play on. Overall a good park to visit.< /review>< Pics>

<text>This has nothing to do with the park itself. It's lovely there and for the majority of the time it's clean. I have in the past reccomended all my family and friends to visit here. So, I'm extremely  bummed I'm posting this review: it's become clear, from my last couple of visits, they're not implementing masks wearing for vistors and within the staff out on site. Also, the park has slowly become more congested these last past weeks. Please correct this!</text><rate>1<//rate>< response>

The park is beautiful and has so much to offer.  It is perfect for hiking, picnics and gatherings.  The one thing we did notice is that there are various trees that are dying or dead.  We were curious if it was due to improper care,  irrigation or a tree disease?</text>

<text>This is a great place to hike, picnic, or take your kids. Free parking on weekdays (except for holidays),  a 2-mile hiking trail around the park, an even longer trail for people more fit than me, horse stables with riding classes, multiple play areas for kids, an outdoor body-resistance gym area for adults, and numerous grassy & wooded areas to explore. This has become my personal place to just get away.< /text>< pics>

this place have been a lifesaver since all the gym have been closed this place allows you to walk miles and miles of trail up into the mountains and gives you a good break on your mind and the well-being of your body, the park is well-kept quiet and safe.</text>

Schabarum park has now planted a bunch of cherry blossoms. Thanks to all the rain we've been having the hiking trails here are awesome. Bring bug spray though</Review>

<username>Bernard Bailey<//username><Text>Great park during the week. Costs something on the weekend but I've never done that. Lots of shade and the property goes on for quite a ways. Horse ranch at the very back. Several play areas for the kids. An outdoor exercise center for those folks who want to do that in public. Nice place to catch Pokemon too.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I only go during the week as entrance to the park is free. They charge to go in with your vehicle on weekends. This park has a few trails that are fun to walk, run, or hike. Also has a ton of picknick areas with charcoal grills. Great for groups, kids and well, everyone.</Review>

As of late September, there are lots of flies and mosquitoes. Wear long sleeves if possible or make sure to bring repellent</Review>

Beautiful park, and I've only seen 1% of it! It gets pretty busy so if you do come via car plan on being patient when parking as cars enter and exit. When I was there working on one of the several picnic tables I heard several car horns.

Four stars because the bathrooms were very gross and this was at 9 in the morning so you could tell they don't clean them overnight. Also picnic tables were very dirty and sticky. It wasn't from the trees, it was from beverages being spilled and other sorts that made it sticky.<//text>

Nice retreat from the suburban sprawl. Great picnic areas to reserve for BBQ's & gatherings. This regional park offers hiking, running, horseback riding, trail biking, tennis courts, amphitheater, playgrounds for kids, free summer concerts, nature to explore and re-creation for all. Support the park - pay the minimal parking fee!< /review>

Not really sure... rattlesnake warning signs around, but I used to live in Palm Springs...the rattlesnakes don't bother anything.  The self entitled, arrogant wanna-be movie star, no-knowing ATTITUDE in general is more venomous.  This park is beautiful... you can hike as far, or short as you prefer.  DO watch out for the critters... THEY we're there before we were!  Respect their rights!!!<//Review>

<text>A great local regional park with trails, play grounds, creek and picnic area with grills.  You can decide how far and how long of time you would like to walk on trails.  You may cross the top of hills and walk to the other side of Fullerton.  Also horse trails inside the end of the park, and you may arrange horse rides.</text><date>1559265039089</date><GmapID>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d</GmapID></record>

This park is pretty expansive. It's got good trails, nice playgrounds, good looking trees. It goes a mile or so back in with parking so there's plenty of space. They do charge entry on weekends and holidays, the rates all seemed to be under $10. I plan on coming here frequently, it seems to be a great place to get some easy steps in< /text>

This park is huge. It's really nice and makes you feel like you aren't surrounded by the chaos of the city. I've been attending the concerts in the park on Thursdays. Parking is free for the events, however I believe there is a fee for parking normally.<//review>

Gotta say it's a nice park. Decent size not real big but easy in and out of the place. Close to lots of shopping centers. Right in the city but feels like your in a bigger park further from the city.. Never new it was there but went to a car show held there and was a great spot</text>

This is my favorite part because of the combination of natural, Wild open spaces where you can hike and encounter wildlife, and for the beautifully designed strip down the main thoroughfare which is perfectly balanced and spaced-out for you to the rental Pagoda, play tennis, have a party, let the children run loose on the playground, or meditate and there is also horseback riding at the very back of the park. This is a wonderful Park</Review>

Regional Park that provides adequate recreational activities for all age alike. Hikers and trail seekers have abundant place to do their trek. Plants and wildlife abounds. The only thing is seeing some trash on the small creek that runs through the park, although not a lot it ruins the natural habitat of some animals, who might be living in that creek. The management should post more warning signs about trash responsibilities to all visitors.< /text>

<Text>While staying at the Courtyard Mariott hotel, I made the short walk to this park.  I walked on the trails that led into the hills at the back of the park.  There was plenty of room on the path.  From the upper levels of the path, the view of the valley was nice.  The area was well maintained.< /Text>< user_name>

Hey this: It's across the street from a mall and a Soup Plantation, a mall, a costco, a movie theater, a bowling alley and so much more yet you can hike, ride a horse, play several sports, enjoy scenic views and wildlife and awesome and clean amenities for kids. Not to mention the awesome staff. Did I mention the urgent care and daiso right next door.<//Text>

<text>I come here for getting my exercise of the week in. Running up from the base near the exercise equipment, it's an uphill battle through relaxing and fulfilling scenery. Last time i went, some Sneaky McSneaks put a snake corpse at the end of a pedestrian bridge (think of how cats respond to cucumbers).

There are lots and lots of bbq grills, with plenty of restrooms and multiple children's play structures.</text>< pics>

<review>This is a huge park with lots of terrain for hiking. Great for those family bbq or picnics. Plenty of solitary spots for you lovers. Beautiful scenarios such as at the wedding gazebo. The park's crew are very friendly and always helpful. Plenty of fun for all!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Good place to hang out with the girlfriend. We grab our food to go from the noodle place across the street and come have a picnic here. Plenty of space and tables. Even when there are many people the park is large enough to find privacy and eat a meal in peace. Keep in mind that the restrooms close when the front booth does. This place is worth the admission price($6) if your going to spend a good part of your day here. Go up the hill high enough and you see a good view of the surrounding areas.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>This is so much more than a park! Came here for a hike with a friend I hadn't seen in far too long, and we just explored and wandered around -- finding trails on hillsides that looked totally removed from the city, the horse stables, the tennis courts, and lots of lovely paved roads too. This park is the perfect spot for family fun days outside, picnics, engagement pictures, etc. It's right across the street from Puente Hills Mall, so if you don't want to pay for parking on the weekends or can't find a spot, head to the mall and walk across the street.

There's a few playgrounds and tons of clean bathrooms. Many groups use the park for weekend salsa, yoga, soccer lessons, etc. Wonderful community space and a great outdoors area for the inland empire.</review><date>1520316522812<//date>< Rate>

I've been going to this park for a long time! It is a lot of fun and quite expansive. I like to stroll through the winding paths, then take a nice hike in the chaparral covered hills that have a great view. The park is also full of beautiful trees and healthy grass which make it a great picnic spot< /review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Schabarum Regional Park is one of those hidden gems in the larger LA area.  Despite being right next to one of the busiest freeways in the city, this is one of the cleanest and quietest parks I have ever been to.  It has great hiking trails and plenty of picnic areas.

I happen to go on a Sunday for a light picnic.  The weather was great for a picnic as the trees would alleviate from the heat, yet there were no picnic-ers.  Perhaps it had something to do with the $6 parking fee.  I thought this to be a small fee to pay for having a quiet picnic.  Sometimes you do want a large space just to yourself.< /Review>< pictures>

Have been coming here quite a bit to hike, and I love this park! Free parking during the week, but you must pay on the weekends. Hikes are nice, and trail is kept up. Typical busy trail hours are anytime after 6pm during the week, and anytime after 7am during the weekend.<//Review>

<Review>there are a lot of winding trails in this park and different routes to walk around through. the trail is well maintained and pretty busy the later in the afternoon it gets. i suggest get here early and leave early as well. overall, it's an easy to get to location and it's close to home. there is somewhat of a difficulty when it comes to finding and parking there though.<//Review>< rating>

This is a great hike. Its about 3 miles roundtrip with steep incline. We usually take the right to left loop for increased level of difficulty.< /review>

Great place for a morning or night walk, dog friendly, next to the 60 fwy, and yet so refreshing! They offer free concerts on Tuesdays throughout the summer. If you are driving there be ready to pay for parking. There are several nice and big areas for picnic, you may need to call to reserve though.< /text>

They need to have someone patrol the area at all times, especially being a popular park, I've been coming here for years and I don't want to see it go to ruin. I took my daughter and there were drug addicts by the bathroom doing what they do best in front of kids!! A lady yelling and walking back and forth talking to herself and scaring the children.</Review>

<text>Lots of parking throughout the park. Bathrooms ok the few times I've gone in. Great trails and beautiful views. Some family tried to close off the bridge leading to the jungle gym area one Satyrday because they reserved the tables for a party. A park worker found out or was informed of this and quickly came over to tell them they can't block access, and that they only have reservations to the tables and not the whole area, which is used by other families and children and pokemon players.
The grounds are nice, I have yet to step on any dog poop which is a huge plus. Dog walkers are considerate and restrain their pets and clean up after them. Just overall a really nice place for a hike, dog walking, picnics, and public events like the pet adoptions, music shows, and pokemon community days<//text><userid>102103962967456590224< /userid><time>1564836722353< /time><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d< /gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><Rating>5</Rating><username>Lizeth Allman<//username></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Never have a bad experience here. There are picnic tables throughout, restrooms located every so often, and playgrounds for children to enjoy. Bring your dog too and enjoy the hiking available (just be sure to have them leashed as it is a leashed park only for pets). Beautiful scenery and lots of open space to picnic.<//Text>< pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Cherry blossoms, horses, lizards, electric towers...

It was not a hike I expected because it was like a walk into the park at first (at least the trail we took) with cherry blossoms surrounding you which were pretty and then it got steeper barren hills. The view over the hill was awesome though, especially since I got to be close to the electric towers and saw a beautiful view of the city.

Bad part was $6 for parking which was a surprised when we entered this place, but at least I had a good time and went to 85 degrees after which was directly across from this place. Cool place to check out and then there are many places to eat and walk around it.< /Review>< name>

Great paved walking paths and some hiking trails. The park is well maintained. Decent amount of pokestops but as you move further into the park, reception can be spotty. Has two tennis courts where there is normally a wait to play. There is also a park admission fee for vehicles depending on day and time. Park closes at sunset.</Text>

<text>This a great park to visit for some fresh air. Lots of open space to walk around and plenty of green grass to enjoy. There are even some workout benches alongside some of the trails, and there was a camping area at one end of the park. As a side note, it is now frequented by Pokemon GO players.</text><name>Cameron Birrell<//name>< Time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>A place where people of all ages and ethnic groups can be found using the wide public spaces available in this park. Numerous hiking trails of varying difficulty, as well as play areas for kids as well. You can call the city to reserve picnic tables, as well as other spaces for private events. Overall, a great public recreation area that meets the needs of the local community. Check it out for yourself. Park on side streets for free parking too< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Nice park. Pretty crowded though. Great place to gather for party or weekend bbq. If you looking for a remote hike this isn't the place for you. If your looking for some easy local trails then this is it. Pretty scenery ..flowers trees dogs are ok on leash. There is also a park fee I believe it was $6 . I parked across the street in the mall parking lot for free.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Trail length: 8/10      Trail difficulty: 4 - 6/10

Big park; restrooms near the parking area. Expect to pay a parking fee on the weekend, which helps maintain the park.  Plenty of shade near the parking and restrooms.

The trails can range from moderate to fairly difficult depending on which ones you take. Their are horse trails you can follow and some get really steep. Others are longer and meander along at a much gentler slope. Some of the trails have some shade but be prepared with a hat.

This places get fairly busy in all areas, from the park grass to any of the back trails, so expect to see people.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I'm not an outdoor person. I only came here to catch pokemon, so I'm mainly rating it for that.

By the entrance is great, 3 stops and usually have several people to talk to.

As you go further in though, signal drops a lot. Also, when I was there, the sprinklers were on and spraying one of the main roads up at around 4 PM - 6 PM, which kind of sucks for people walking.< /text>

This is really good park for exercises and other activities.  Monday to Friday is free parking.  The weekend (Sat and Sun) is charged for $8 I think.  I like to come here for trail walk.  Sometimes, I will bring my dogs to walk with me.  You can drive your car all the way up and park there.  There is a loop trail about 3.2 miles.  Usually it takes me about 70 mins to walk.</Text>

The trail offers different degree and level of hiker’s expertise. I’m satisfied with the terrain, distance, view from the ridges and impressed how well it’s maintained.</Text>

HUGE park with lots of different areas as you drive up.  Where the normal grassy park area ends there is an equestrian area.  Beyond that is a good amount of hiking trails that go up the mountain.</review>

Decent park in Rowland Heights--no parking fees on the weekdays, but there is a fee on the weekends. A good place to just hike, walk around, and just enjoy nature.  There are no horse trails here, if you're looking for that kind of stuff</Review>

Big park suitable for all types of activities. Has multiple playgrounds, tables and grills, hiking trails, and even a horse stable. Plenty of street parking if you don't want to pay the entrance fees.< /text>

<user>103933959540024378642< /user><text>I came here for Bulbasaur during the Pokemon GO craze. It is definitely a park for those with Asian heritage. It can be daunting for people like my fiance who don't share that heritage. Also, it's huge. If you don't want to pay for parking, get there EARLY and park along the street. Get ready for a long but casual hike, if you plan to go all the up the mountain.< /text><pics>None</pics><Name>Lloyd Allen</Name><date>1486611938000</date><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great for hikes, bikes, dogs, walks. Great for grandparents and pokecatchers. And grandparent pokecatchers. You can catch a horse ride, explore multiple trails that can go for hours, or make the circle 3-mile small hike around the park. Play tennis, picnic, playground with the kids (but only if they're your own kids). The rain has brought back some of the childhood brooks!! FINALLY. We used to catch tadpoles here.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Visited this park with my fiance when we first began dating a couple years ago.. we still go. Very serene, I used to like sitting underneath the trees or hiking & hear the wind blow through the trees. There's also wild animals; rabbits squirrels & owls I once even saw a bobcat!! The trails are great, but watch your step!! Theres horse poo & ruts after it rains and gets muddy.</review>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Great place to ride a bike.  Some of the trails (the Skyline) can be quite steep so if you are a beginner, stay away for now.  There is a parking fee on weekends so we tend to park on the street beside the park.  No, you cannot park at the Marshalls near by :)</text>< time>

Morning or night, great trails and good air.  Be careful, 6-9AM is busiest due to older people trying to get in their daily walk.< /Text>

I really like this park, it has hiking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas where you can have carne asada, lot of trees and squirrels, oh and if you are lucky you'll see bunnies too 😉 Parking is $6, if you want to take fresh air and forget about the city and the smog this is the place!<//review>

Huge park. Amazing for Pokémon Go players with multiple stops, gyms and tons of Pokémon. Biggest problem is people constantly walk in the road way in front of cars instead of the walking paths. Park is free on weekdays, pay on weekends.</Review>

< Review>
REALLY BIG PARK WITH MANY TRAILS THAT GO INTO SORROUNDING CITIES, GREAT VIEWS.. SOME TRAILS ARE A LITTLE TOUGH BUT WELL WORTH THE HIKE..WITH PLENTY OF WAYS TO GET IN...THIS MAKES IT FREE, SINCE THEY CHARGE ON WEEKDAYS I THINK..WEEKENDS IS FREE BUT ..IN REALITY ITS FREE EVERY DAY.. THERES 3 JUNGLE JIMS FOR THE KIDS, THERE A CAMP CIRCLE FOR FIRES OR STORY TELLING..THERES A SOCCER COMPLEX FIELD.THEY HAVE HORSE THAT YOU RENT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, ITS AN AWESOME PARK TO HOST EVENTS..PARTIES ETC</Review>

This park is huge. Theres a lot to see in this park and is a perfect  place to get a nice work out just walking around enjoying the scenary. It has a very nice trail you can go up to. Many people take their beautiful dogs and you can even see people on horses come by. It's always filled with happy people and kids. If you play pokemon GO then this is  a perfect place to come as well because of all the pokestops. I have been coming for a year and have yet to see all of it.<//review>

Tons of tables for picnics. Plenty of bathrooms and water fountains. Workout bars at the bottom. Playground in middle with sandpit. Many people walking dogs up hill as well as a few joggers.<//Review>

I always come here with my cat and dog. Watch out for crows if you bring your cat because the crows like to scope the area surrounding cat. But they never attack.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>(Translated by Google) When I came to LA, it was the first time I came here. It felt very hot, as hot as Phoenix, but at least there are big trees to enjoy the cool and a little green turf.
This park has a big playground area for walking and children (but it’s still too hot at two or three o’clock). However, there are too many police officers. I see a patrol car every ten minutes. I don’t know. what happen? There is a helicopter when I have to go...it’s really hot when walking here with a child on my back

(Original)
來LA，第一次來這，感覺很熱，跟Phoenix 一樣熱，不過至少這還有大樹可以乘涼、少許的草皮綠衣點最。
這公園有很大可以走路運動、小孩的遊樂區可以讓小孩玩（不過兩三點來這還是太熱）、不過，這警察也太多了，每十分鐘就看到一次巡邏車，不知道發生什麼事？要走時還有直升飛機...背著小孩在這走路，真的很熱...< /review>< time>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><username>Stacy Choi</username><Review>(Translated by Google) The parking lot is big, there are lots of toilets, the trail course is good, and there are several forked roads, so it's easy to walk around and get back on the way. It's great for kids to play with, and they have exercise equipment.

파킹랏도 크고 화장실도많고 트레일코스도 좋고요 갈래길도 여러개라 자기체력에 맞게 걷다가 도중에 돌아나오기쉬워요.  어린애들 놀기에 좋고 운동기구도 있고요.<//Review><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) It may be a common natural park in the United States, but it's the first California park I've ever met. Phytoncide, the bush? So good. It is good without separation. It is just nature. As soon as we left, we could climb to the right, and the view of the city was very good. Anyway, it was good. Berry berry. I want to live in California. I grow up every day.

미국에선 흔해 빠진 자연 공원일지 모르지만 내가 처음 겪은 캘리포니아의 공원이라 그런가 피톤치드, 숲향? 너무 좋다. 별거 없이 좋다. 그저 자연이 좋다. 출발하자 마자 오른쪽으로 올라가서 보이는 전경은 도시가 다보여 너무 좋았다. 아무튼 좋았다. 베리베리. 캘리포니아에서 살고 싶은 생각이 든다. 매일매일 무럭무럭 자라난다.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Rowland Heights Highland Park, sometimes you can see snakes, you must be careful of snakes when you play. The view here is very wide and the scenery is very beautiful!

<review>(Translated by Google) This is Regional Park in the middle of Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights. Many people are here for hiking, kung fu (tai chi), dancing, horse riding, and tennis cricket. Convenient; there are large areas of cherry blossoms, and the cherry blossoms are quite beautiful.

(Original)
這是Regional Park在Hacienda Heights及Rowland Heights中間，許多人在此健行、練功夫（太極）、舞蹈、騎馬、还有網球埸，地点適中，停車位多，去Hollywood Biwl都有公車站，非常的方便；有大片的樱花，樱花盛开時相当的美。<//review><user_id>112955752355599562226</user_id></record></dataset><record>
