<Text>Working w/ Jessica at Borders Custom Embroidery was a pleasant experience. In addition to excellent customer service, Jessica helped me pick out the best mask that fit perfectly. The embroidery on the mask is definitely top quality. I’m looking forward to do more custom embroidery in the near future. Thank you again!<//Text>< rating>

Great service and even greater quality! I remember when they were working out of their garage and now they have grown and expanded to a legitimate business. I have been going to borders for all my embroidery needs since day 1.  The quality and price are unmatched. The work that they have done for me ranges from custom t-shirts to beanies, and even graduation stoles. They do everything! If you are looking for custom embroidery, Borders is the place to go because with Borders every stitch counts!< /review>

<Text>Thank you so much, I needed an embroidery shop asap to have so late gifts done  and Borders was the only embroidery shop to respond and  that was literally open. They had my order ready for me in one day. This is definitely the fastest the fastest turn around time, I have ever experienced as most print shops normally take 3 or more weeks to complete . Will be coming back here no matter what for my embroidery needs. Thanks so much you saved me, Jessica is so awesome  I love her and Borders.!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2917687de572b:0xc9020ff1427601c2< /Gmap_id></record>

I came by the store for a couple of Loving Memory pieces I needed to get done. Johnny was very helpful in picking me out a design for font as well as sizing of the embroidery I needed. Since I needed a dozen shirts as well they hooked us up for a deal I couldn’t walk away from. The entire process was smooth and we was alerted what was going on the whole time. Now me and my buddies got really cool Loving Memory shirts with a little design made specially here all thanks to the hard work of John. Def coming back for more work.

Before leaving the store my 3 yo was looking at some toys they have there and we happened to find a few for him as well. Lol a little something for everybody I guess. Thanks guys !!!</review>

Finally found what I’ve been looking for!  Borders Custom Embroidery has got to be one of the best places out there.  They greet you with a smile and you end up leaving with one.  Superb customer service.  They have got to need more customers with how low their prices are.  The other places I’ve looked have double the price, sometimes even more!  The moment you open your items, you can immediately tell they take their time to assure quality.  I like that.
I offered to expedite my items for a price since I needed it by a certain time, but they refused and told me it was going to take that long anyway.  They work hard!!! What great service they provide. They’re like McDonald’s, I’m loving it!

The shop itself is very unique, it’s like a museum, very interesting.< /Text>

<text>I normally do extensive research on the kind of company that I want to be affiliated with so that I can achieve my brand goals. Borders Custom Embroidery is one of the top 3 companies on which I set my eyes on and I was not wrong in my judgment as the values of this company are very much in line with the values that I have set for myself. This company is truly great because it offers small entrepreneurs a chance for progress and grow.

Overall, Borders Custom Embroidery is a company where I can work collaboratively with bright people to achieve my goals. Thank you and I will be bringing my business to Borders Custom embroidery.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Borders custom embroidery was able to help my family out with a couple of detailed work on shirts. We just opened up a jewelry shop and needed customized professional shirts for the employees and this company gave us a lot of ideas. They even worked out a logo for us and was able to finish the entire project within a week. Thanks again so much for the help and the fast timing our shirts look awesome.< /Text>

Most other shops will not even quote you until you send them an email or else they will not waste their own time. Not these fine  folks they actually care !  Thank you ! Above all else the Embroidery quality is on point and the best quality i have gotten compared to other embroidery shops . will be bringing my business back here , Thank you again ! - Solomon</text>< username>

<Text>It’s hard to find good quality embroidery. Most places are cheap and take shortcuts either via material, color, detail. This place was a diamond in the rough. The owner Jonathan is a super chill guy. He gave a small tour of his shop which is like a legit spot to chill. I bought a white hat with a Freemason design on it. It came out amazing!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>If you really need something embroidered , Borders Custom Embroidery is the place . They offer super quick turn around times and also will literally print you a sample of your logo before they actually start printing . They take the time to understand the customers needs and that is really rare now a days. I needed a dozen hoodies and sweat pants and was allowed to pick everything from the font I wanted to the colors and specific sizing. Very affordable and excellent customer service. I seldom write reviews but this one  I could not miss, Thank you Yessica you are Awesome !</review><Response>None</Response><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>5< /rate>< user_name>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND ! The environment is very welcoming, friendly and professional . They do excellent work here beyond my expectations. I came here to get my graduation sash embroidered (which I had many ideas for) and I couldn’t have picked somewhere better to get the amazing results I did.

This place is so awesome! The owner is super welcoming and works amazingly to create the perfect custom designs to your liking. Will definitely be back; my little cousins loved the custom anime masks he made. Thanks again :)</review>

Let me first start out by saying how amazing and unique the inside of the store borders is, truly amazing I have never seen anything like it, which makes for such a friendly and  relax environment  . I Purchased a rush order item I really needed the same day and they literally took the time to cater to my order and get it done .  No other store I have gone to will do this and with such a great quality of customer service and smile. This company is strictly about the customer and that is why I will always be bringing my work here . Overall embroidery work is 10/10.  Thank you guys !<//text>

They have a wide selection of material and a wide variety of customization options available. The owner is a great guy, super helpful and guided me with options and ideas to help define what I really wanted. I came in not knowing much of what to do at all, but with the help of John and Yessica their expertise and craftsmanship assured me.

The final product was superb (I had custom beanies, hats, shirts and some hoodies with my business & personal logo on them) Borders will be fulfilling all my personal and business embroidery needs for the future to come! Keep up the great work guys!<//review><Time>1588731587439<//Time></record>

They have excellent customer service that communicates very well and can walk you through all of the options and costs in a relaxed, simple way. I went to several different shops to get custom embroidery on hats but none were as professional as Borders. Also they are open on weekends and even after hours, so you can call and they’ll likely be there to help you.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2917687de572b:0xc9020ff1427601c2</gmap_id></record>

I have found a new nail salon home!  My manicurist is a rockstar.  She is super professional and very personable.  Her work is impeccable and I am very particular!  The gel polish selection is expansive and very up to date with all the latest colors. This was my second time at this salon and I will be back again for sure!!!<//text>

I love my manicurist!! She is super detail-oriented and nice.  I am OCD about nails and details and usually I have to turn a blind eye but I think I've finally found quality at this place!  My nails turned out top-notch quality for a work conference next week.  They really mean the "plus" in the name and offer amazing service and take great care of you when you're there. I'll definitely be coming back for high quality pampering and looking my best!</text>

This place is amazing! We went today to get pedicures and they did a great job. They took their time to make sure our nails were perfect. Everyone working there was very friendly! They also have just about every OPI color that you could wish for. I will definitely be back!< /Text>

Wanted to try this place because some girls I know go here. It was very clean and the nail polish was well organized. The staff were extremely helpful and went out of the way to make me feel comfortable my first time. It was amazing of course totally worth it!< /Text>

<review>They are very rough on your hands and rush through to get to the next customer.  Their $35 pedicure does not include any kind of massage on your legs and feet!! Such a RIP off!! Skin around my nails ached and bled after. They were not cleaning the stations in between customers either.< /review><username>subrina lara< /username>< user_id>

They were very sweet. I came here with my grandma we asked for pedicure but no gel. I got no gel for the pedicure but my grandma did, the price for a pedicure without gel was 10 or 15 dollars but they paid us 25 each.<//review>

The next day we asked if they could redo 3 of them but they instead only cut them. My friend and I don’t recommend to anyone to get there acrylics done here. They had terrible customer service and were talking bad about us to redo it when they are the ones who messed up.

They should have the option of 0 stars horrible service we went in there to get our feet & nails done but it was too packed so when one of the employees come up to us  to see if we still want our feet and nails done even tho every chair was full and had no space for us. So we kindly told her no and will be back first thing in the morning she give us and angry face and says something to the other workers and they all turn back at us and she had a male worker come up to 4 of us ALL women to tell us why are we still here and  motioned us to get out . Very disappointing and  disgusting< /text>

SADLY That is the lowest you can go on Stars. FIRST AND LAST Time I will be going there. Worst service ever!!!! Ugh!! My nails look like a little girl did them literally. She used the same gloves that were used on the client before me and probably even the one before, they were filled with Different nail polish color, she cut me as well during the manicure, and she still wanted to charge me for the original price. Worst,Dirty, unprofessional job!!!<//review>

<Text>I loved how they do an affordable pedicure ! It was nice and they did a good job! The only problem was that i did my nails too on my regular nail and i had matte and a couple hours later one nail chipped and the paint had gone off but i went back and they fixed it for me ! Besides that i will continue to go for pedicures only!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Great low cost pedicure but hard upsell. Would rather pay 15 without the discomfort of saying no so many times</review>

Exactly what I expect from a pizza by the slice, price and taste-wise, but won't give 5 until I try it again for consistency.</text>

The pizza and sides tasted great! I got the deluxe pizza and the garlic cheesy rolls. I really recommend the garlic cheesy rolls cause the cheese pulls were so satisfying and it was a good ratio of cheese, bread, and garlic. The wait time was a bit longer than estimated from ordering through yelp so make sure to call before you head over if you're picking up.<//Review>

Wanted to eat something at the airport that wasn't a burger. This was one of the few choices available. It is right near gate 18. The food was just ok.. We ordered the bbq chicken pizza for $18.18USD. It came out looking like aAmeci Pizza Kitchen . Not much sauce, meat or large at all. Normally, we can't finish an entire pizza. However, this pizza was sliced into 5 pieces and we were able to all of it. We also order the shishito peppers. It was tasty. However, a bit on the salty side. I was fairly disappointed. I don't think I will come back to this establishment again.</Review>

<review>Worst customer service!!!! I walked in to Foothill location to place an order and the salesperson was sooo not welcoming. He didn’t say hi, I was asking questions and he was not answering them or just saying “what?” with a blank face.  Seriously, I’ve never seen a salesperson with such an attitude in my life. How even they let a person like that deal with customers?! The pizza was great though. I was ordering through Postmates before and didn’t have to deal with their customer service before, but oh my God, that person ruined my day yesterday. I will never walk in there again!</review><time>1567107170448</time>< GmapID>

One of the best pizza places in town for sure.
The service is incredible....They treat you as a family. The pizza itself is so fresh and lite as i wanted it. Definately coming back anytime i am in town. Thanks 5 star for sure. P.S prices are unbelivable.<//review>

I usually get delivery from the Glendale location but I've ordered a couple times from here from a friend's house. I'm glad they opened up here. Nice staff and best pizza around.</text>

I was skeptical being that this is a new place. But after ordering pizza and wings I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, price  and flavor. The wings are man sized not the cheap tiny wings you get from the other chain places. I will definitely order from here again. *Update* this review was done when this place was not Ameci.< /Text>

<text>We tried this place out for the first time tonight, WE ALL LOVED IT!   We intended to try the cracker crust but forgot to mention it, we got sent home with a lovely sample . It was fanatic,  will definitely be going back. The wings are baked too and yummy!    Ohhh and they have gluten free options too!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

(Los Alamitos) First visit lasted 10 minutes when the doc heard my concerns and immediately ordered 3 tests including a CT scan. I felt it was rushed visit but I trusted him.

Second visit, with test results also lasted barely 15 minutes although there was no diagnosis but I again trusted the doc maybe indeed it was not ENT problem.

What makes me upset is that doctor did not seem to hear my symptoms and was rushed throughout. Even forgot to review CT Scan test report, which when he did look… it was on a computer 8 feet away in a noisy lobby where I could barely hear anything.

What amuses me is that the staff offered to schedule a follow up appointment, which I declined as the doc has already told “can’t help you”.

I think the doctor is great, my problem may not have been straightforward, but I expected some plan or recommendations from the doc.<//text>

Dr. Miller is professional and takes time understanding patient health issues.
He cares about each of his patients and is easy to talk too.
I’ve been a patient for over 8 years and have had 2 sinus surgeries done by Dr. Miller.
I have been happy with each outcome and patience visit.
Dr. Miller is top notch.<//text>

Dr. Miller is very knowledgeable and has great bedside manners.
He listened to my concerns and addressed each accordingly.
He also performed a endoscopy on me that was painlessly and walked me through each step.
I would recommend him to anyone looking for an ENT specialist .< /Review>

The office personnel, medical assistant or John, and Dr. Todd Miller were friendly, focused, as well as very competent.  Dr. Miller did his assessments and got right on the necessary procedures, shared his findings, and next steps to take if I chose to continue to maintain my ENT health.  I trust Dr. Miller's judgement and recommendations.  He is open to questions.  He's a good guy as well as being professional in all aspects.<//text>

Dr. Todd Miller is efficient in determining a course of action subsequent to diagnosis. The doctor executes a treatment plan that has worked 100% of the time for me. Great ENT and I have recommended him to all of my family and friends. The doctor's office staff is also very professional and helpful.< /Text>

I called in for a refill for Dr. Fishman and discovered he retired and so I needed to be seen by his partner Dr Miller. The nice receptionist was able to get me an appointment the next morning. Dr Miller quickly diagnosed me with Sinusitis and prescribed meds and I was out of there within 30 minutes. I was amazed at how fast my appointment took. The whole experience was pleasant. Dr. Miller and his staff are so nice and I highly recommend them if you need a great ENT doctor.</review>

Friendly staff & clean office.  Good COVID protocols.   Easy to make appointments for the same week.  Great communication in regards to appointment reminders (texts).  The office seems to run very smoothly, as I have never waited long to be seen by Dr. Miller.< /Text>

My appt was for 3:15 and I was taken back into the exam room exactly 3:10.  The assistant asked some questions and said Dr. Miller would be I. Shortly.  With 5 mi utes he came in.  He asked more questions, looked in my ear, saw the problem and fixed it.  He also checked the other ear to make sure it was ok and then also looked up my nose and in my mouth. Very thorough!  He also answered all the questions I had.  I was very pleased with my experience with Dr. Todd Miller and the other staff.< /Text>

<Review>Dr Miller was GRRRRRRREAT. From the time I checked in till the time I walked out was under 30 minutes. The whole staff was very friendly and the young lady who walked me to my room and took my blood pressure was very funny reminding me if I did not fill out all of my forms someone will go to my house and knock on my door. Once she left a few minutes later Dr. Miller came and examined me made some notes and forward my prescription to my pharmacy of choice.

Thank you to the whole staff at that office for your prompt and courteous work.

This is got to be one of the best doctor visits I’ve had in a long time.</Review>< pictures>

I have been seeing Dr.Miller for over a year
I have a Deviated Septum, and other problems.
He's always on time courteous, and gives
You the best advice and treatment. If your
Problem still persists  Surgery is last option.<//Review>

I had to spend a night in the hospital due to a choking incident, so visited Dr. Miller, an ENT dr.  The asst took info and typed it into the computer.  When Dr Miller came in, he also spent the majority of the office visit on the computer.  He did check my nose, ears and throat and removed wax from my ears.  He said to continue following the instructions from the speech therapist and come back in 3 months.</Text>

<Review>I was misguided by the good ratings on Insurance company website.  Overall result was bad. I went there for throat pain which my PCP could not understand. Dr. Sidney was nice, ordered a few tests and gave some prescriptions to Walgreens in Cypress on corner of Ball and Moody. Insurance wanted generic. Faxes between Walgreens and Dr's office went on for days but no medicine. Pharmacy and office kept on blaming each other until second visit. Second visit was early morning. Looked like he was still tired. At this age, he may need more rest. I told Dr. about medicine issue due to poor communication from office. Behavior wasn't pleasant but was kind of reactive. Another prescription was sent to pharmacy. Same thing happened again. No medicine. I hate to ask Dr's office again. On my way to work, I was thinking in a different way. The doctor actually is the worker in this office. The staff makes sure that doctor doesn’t waste a minute because he is the one who earns money for the salary of all staff and the overheads. Who is the boss?<//Review><time>1539828910448</time>< Pics>

Dr. Fishman was very aburpt and rough. He never introduced himself or asked my name. Before he was to examine an area he didn't  have the courtesy to explain what he was about to do. He just pushed or jerked my head. Absolutely NO bedside manner. I reported him to my insurance about his behavior.  (1st time I've ever done this)  After telling friends in the medical field about his behavior...they ALL made the comment he has a horrible reputation for the things I experienced.</review>

I would not recommend this place to any of my friends or family. I felt belittled by Jeffrey Lee, and felt as though he was a salesman, more than a dentist. He tried selling me on irrelevant things, and upped my intial estimate by more than 400%. He seems very money-hungry than friendly. Again, would not recommend.

Also, met him during the beginning of Covid-19, when everything was scary and uncertain. He mentioned to another patient that he traveled to a different state because they were allowed to dine-in there. NOT something I want to hear when I am meeting a health-care 'professional' who is dealing with multiple patients a day.</review>

I am a general dentist and I work with several oral surgeons in the area. All my patients are always happy when they return from Dr. Lee's office. So when I needed a wisdom tooth removed, I chose Dr. Lee. Painless and comfortable the entire visit. His resume speaks for itself.</text>

Having your wisdom teeth taken out is a very scary process. I usually don’t write a lot of reviews, but I absolutely have to because my experience was so WONDERFUL! My dentist referred me to a office (not Dr. Lee’s) to get my wisdom teeth pulled, when I reached out to them to make an appointment no response. It took a month to get a reply saying they were “so busy” and I didn’t hear anything after that!  So then my dentist gave me Dr. Lee’s information and the front desk was beyond amazing they made my appointment instantly. They even accommodated me with a earlier date because my teeth were starting to bother me. When I got there I was pretty nervous, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Everyone was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. Dr Lee came into the room and explained exactly what he would be doing and offered me two services; Growth Factor & Ozonotherapy Injection. If you are going to do the surgery I highly recommend doing these procedures they cut your healing time! It’s only a little more money, but completely worth it! By day 4 I felt almost completely healed. I had heard horror stories from my friends about the healing process, but not me! They also do a follow up to check up to make sure everything is good and no infections. Dr. Lee’s office staff was very on top of everything and I have already recommended a few friends to go there! Thanks again for such a smooth procedure! :)< /text>

Had all of my wisdom teeth pulled here. Dr. Lee is very knowledgable and does all he can to make the operation as pleasant as possible. I followed his aftercare directions to a T and had zero pain for the weeks following as well! I also appreciate the checkups that the office provides; I will definitely be returning to have my wife's teeth pulled here as well.<//Review>

I had all four wisdom teeth extracted. I had a lot of concerns prior to surgery, and dr. Lee honored all my requests. He explained in detail what would take place during and after the procedure, so I felt very in-the-know, and it helped me feel more comfortable. No horror stories for me! if you have concerns, you are in good hands here. Staff is friendly as well, would definitely recommend.</Text>

Outstanding, kind and compassionate Oral Surgeon. Within an hour of entering his office he performed emergency oral surgery on my wife while our regular dentist was on vacation. He followed her recovery on a daily basis for several weeks with the same kindness and compassion each day.  His office staff also reflected this same kindness and greeted us with a smile and hello each time we entered the office, as if we were long time friends. I highly recommend Dr. Lee and his staff of professionals to anyone. Single best experience we have had in a dental office in Southern California.</Text>

<review>My son had surgery to remove the 4 wisdom teeth, at first we had many doubts about the procedure, but the staff and Dr. Lee explained us very clearly and answered all the questions we had, before the procedure they also explained to us about the total cost  of the surgery, and they gave us the option of doing it or not, for me it was necessary to know the cost since I was going to pay in cash, but the best thing was that the doctor gave me a discount, my son had no problem before or after  of the surgery, also he had follow  up calls, to verify that he hasn't any problem with the surgery, we are very happy with the service they provide to us.
I saw to many comments about that the services are expensive, but I think that you are getting the service for what you are paying.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I got both of my bottom wisdom teeth extracted here because they were too close to my nerves and so my dentist didn’t want to be the one to do my bottom extractions so he recommended me to Jeffrey Lee. I had a great experience, the staff is so great, and the operation went super smooth. My healing process has been so manageable too, which says a lot about how the procedure was done!

<text>I just completed my treatment and I am very pleased with the results.  I had an extraction and an implant and all went very well.

The total experience was excellent.  Dr. Lee and his staff were professional and very friendly.  Dr. Lee thoroughly explained all aspects of the treatment.  He genuinely cares about his patients.

The outcome was outstanding.  I will miss my chats with Dr. Lee and I wish him and his staff the very best in the future.</text>< pictures>

<review>I arrived to my appointment early @ 1pm due to new patient paperwork. I was fasting due to anesthesia. I haven't ate since 7 am this morning.

I wasn't brought in the back until 2:30 and Tamara did the panaromic
X-ray. Around 3, Dr. Lee gave me a consultation. Another woman (did not get her name) went over the expenses.

She did ask if I wanted to get more work done that needed to be done but I declined as it was $1400 out of pocket. Dr. Lee did wave the fee for the X-ray out of courtesy. Thank you God!

As for the procedure, I was waiting quite some time. I was hungry due to me fasting. Tamara and Marie we're amazing and very considerate.

After all was done, another assist asked if I had any questions regarding the healing process. I was walked to our car in a wheelchair by Tamara. By far the best in comforting.

As I arrived home, I noticed they did not give me dissolve stitches. I use to go to Western Dental and they even given me dissolve stitches.

The bleeding has yet to stop for me to eat. I'm concerned and upset. I'm hungry and have yet to eat or drink anything. I wish I would have read reviews before going.

I have my follow up in 3 weeks and I will post an update when this day arrives. The waits are long, especially if you are fasting. The run around on the phone was quite unusual for medical offices, I've dealt with. The over procedure was fast but waiting laying down was quite to long. We left @ 4:50.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Would give negative stars if I could. Please read all reviews before seeing Dr. Jeffrey as I wish I had. The office staff while very nice, failed to inform you that it will be a minimum wait time of 3 hours just for a consultation. I had to leave and come back as I had another appointment I had to make after waiting 2 hours. When I came back again we waited another 3 hours. When we finally were able to see Dr. Lee he was very impatient and annoyed to have to answer any of my questions. Despise being in my network, the consultation  cost me $400 just to be given an outrageous estimate that was 3 times more than other estimates I received. Then weeks later I received another bill for an X-ray they said was covered, but now all of a sudden wasn’t. I was also told they would work with me on lowering the price of the surgery, but based on other reviews on here, there is no way I trust them. Lowering the price seems to be their dishonest way of convincing you to have them do it while they end up just billing you for all additional procedures after the fact when there is nothing you can do about it. This office has very shady business practices and I recommend going else where.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcdbd9b7bcfa8b:0xe28099ea15118100</gmapID>< resp>

Initially I felt nervous because I had to remove all four of my wisdom teeth at once, but Dr. Lee made me feel comfortable prior to the surgery. He communicated with me patiently and clearly what exactly he was going to be doing and how I should take care of myself post-surgery. The procedure was quick and painless, and I'm relieved to say that I am going through a smooth recovery. Much appreciation for Dr. Lee and his wonderful staff!</review>

I am pleased with the overall experience of my wisdom teeth extraction. Dr. Lee's office squeezed me in last minute to accommodate my insurance coverage date. The office staff are thorough, friendly, and professional.
Dr. Lee was available by phone on a holiday and provided consultation to me on his time off. Additionally, the nurses and staff called multiple times during the recovery weeks to check-in on my healing process. This is quality care.
I highly recommend Dr. Jeffrey Lee.<//Text>

Dr. Lee is the total professional.  He is knowledgeable, personable and dedicated and has the expertise to solve any problem.  Equally important, he takes the time to fully explain everything about your situation.  His office staff is absolutely outstanding.  I have never seen such an efficient and friendly staff.  It is a pleasure to interact with the staff.  I highly recommend seeing Dr. Lee for any dental issues.</text>

<Review>Dr. Lee was very welcoming and a kind surgeon who made me very comfortable in his office. I went in yesterday, and after filling out a bit of paperwork, his staff led me back to evaluate me and walk me through the process. I was extremely nervous beforehand about my wisdom teeth extraction, but his staff certainly put me at ease. The operation went without complication, and the swelling on day two is minimum. I give his office a 7,000 out of 10. Heck, I'd even get my teeth extracted again.</Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
A definite five star review for Dr Lee and his staff. My first impression was wow look at this man's credentials!  The office is immaculate!  I first met Dr Lee as I had an emergency consult for a damaged tooth.  I was provided my options.  I wanted an implant and really did not know much about it including the process.  The entire process would cost quite a bit of money and my insurance for the year had already been used up.  After the initial consult and detailed cost explanation which were very over whelming to me.   In the days to follow I conducted further investigations of other surgeons.   I was convinced that Dr Lee is the choice for my situation.  The surgery was handled beautifully.  Kathryn was so knowledgeable regarding cost, insurance and making sure I understood everything.  She was very patient with me.  The end result is that I have an implant and even though my dentist's lab created the tooth the final results are amazing.  The practice makes sure that you understand everything and are patient and kind.  I am very pleased with the whole process and each step of the way. I would not hesitate to go back if needed.< /Review>

I needed an emergency extraction and it was a Friday afternoon.  My regular oral surgeon couldnt see me until the following Monday, and I was in a lot of pain.  My dentist recommended I call Dr Jeffrey Lee, whose office was further away, but he said he was an excellent surgeon.  When I called the office staff was very responsive and caring, and they worked me into an already busy schedule that day!  Dr. Lee stayed late in order to accommodate me, and besides being affordable, he was very skilled and attentive.  The follow-up phone calls and visits were outstanding as well.  I recommend Dr Lee without reservation--you won't be sorry!< /Text>

Dr. Jeffrey Lee and his staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I took my daughter there to get her wisdom teeth removed and everything went smoothly. They were very detailed about the procedure and the post care. We had such a great experience that I took my other daughter to get her wisdom teeth removed as well a few months later. Would recommend for wisdom teeth removal.<//Review>

Dr. Lee and his staff were professional and definitely nice. When originally scheduling my appointment to have 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, I appreciated the staff asking if I was currently having problems/pain to see if I needed them out urgently. Fortunately, I did not. I was able to schedule an appointment for the day and time I wanted. The day of surgery went well. The procedural sedation was adequate and without problems. 2 weeks later during the post-op visit, everything was simple and the quality of care from Dr. Lee and his staff is top-rate.</Text>

Dr. Lee was recommended to me by my dentist when it was discovered I had to have one of my front teeth extracted. Through the entire process Dr. Lee and his staff were very clear about my options and presented the costs of each step (extraction, implant, abutmen) upfront. The surgery went smoothly and I experienced almost no post operation pain. After placing the abutment Dr. Lee continued to work with my dentist to ensure there were no issues when placing the crown. My teeth look great, you would not be able to tell which one was fake unless I told you. I would recommend Dr. Lee to anyone requiring oral surgery.< /review>

<review>I had all my 4 wisdom teeth extracted by Dr. Jeffrey Lee about 2 months ago. Prior to the surgery, they alerted me to certain procedures; during surgery and right after they helped me recover; then after the surgery they told me about the cautions I had to take. The service was wonderful and Dr. Jeffery Lee did an amazing job with my surgery. I felt absolutely no pain during surgery and almost no pain afterwards. The healing process was simple and quick. My mouth looks like nothing even happened. Everybody in his office was extremely nice and professional. I was very happy and lucky to have Dr. Jeffrey Lee to extract my wisdom teeth.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Lee removed all four of my wisdom teeth at the same time and as much as people say that was going to be very difficult to handle, Dr. Lee and his staff did a great job and made it as comfortable as possible for me. The consultation, surgery, and post surgery care were all EXCELLENT. I had two impacted wisdom teeth and even with the difficulty of the surgery, Dr. Lee did an excellent job removing them.

My experience with Dr. Lee was amazing. He was very nice when I met him along with the staff and everyone at the front desk was super kind and willing to help. It made the process a lot more enjoyable and easy to do. In addition, Dr. Lwe talked to us about everything that was going that happen and why.< /Review>

Dr. Jeffrey Lee recently removed my son's wisdom teeth and we had the best experience. He thoroughly explained the surgery in detail and also what to expect in the days after. He was very sensitive to my sons questions and fears. His staff is very nice and followed up several times to check on my son.
I highly recommend Dr Jeffrey Lee for any dental experience you may need to have done.< /text>

I just recently got my wisdom teeth extracted by Dr. Lee. From start to finish, I had a great experience. His staff is extremely helpful and was always following up on me post-surgery, which was appreciated. I would come back to Dr. Lee again if i needed anything and I would recommend Dr. Lee to anyone that needs his dental services!< /Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Jeffrey Lee is unusual in that he is both a licensed physician and a licensed dentist.  Several members of my family have gone to him and we have all had exceptionally good experiences with him.  He’s the only oral surgeon I ever want to go to again.

All that said, this would be a five-star review were it not for the attitude of the back office crew.  On three occasions I’ve been placed in an examination room and left alone without contact for over half an hour.  After the second time this happened, I discussed this with the office manager Diana, who agreed it shouldn’t happen and who told me it wouldn’t happen again.  Two appointments later it happened again.

So, I don’t trust the office manager.  ☹<//review>< pics>

But on the day I met Dr. Lee I was pacified with his unassuming behavior and professionalism. His clinic set-up is very professional in every way from reception to his assistants. Not to mention that Dr. Lee is not only an oral/maxillofacial surgeon but also certified in medical practice. I really felt I got good, caring and professional care from him and his office staff....highly recommended.</Review>< Response>

< Review>
Dr. Lee and his staff was professional and friendly throughout my treatment. I recovered quickly and had minimal pain. They followed up and made sure I was completely satisfied. Dr. Lee answered all my questions and took my appointment on a last minute which I greatly appreciated. I would highly recommend Dr. Lee to anyone looking for an oral surgeon, he is someone I trust.< /Review>

<review>I had all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. From beginning to end my experience was the best I could of asked for. I had little to no pain and healed relatively quick. Also, the staff is friendly and makes you feel very comfortable in what seems like something that could be a scary experience.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><Resp>None</Resp>< user>

<Review>After I had felt pain throughout my mouth for about 2 months (it was off-and-on), my dentist referred me to Dr. Lee.  I knew about him because my brother also had his wisdom teeth removed by him.  I called to set up a consultation appointment with him so I could determine the best course of action.  The staff was really friendly and helpful in setting it up.  And although they thought that I was going to have my teeth removed at that time, they were really nice about my situation and wanting to have them removed at a later date.  When I came, they got me in quickly, and Dr. Lee extracted them without any trouble.  He had warned me of possible complications and whenever I had a problem, he was quick to return calls and answer my questions.  And even the staff was friendly enough to put up with my constant changing of my follow-up appointments.  I would totally recommend a friend or relative to him for wisdom teeth extraction.< /Review><Date>1356064093234<//Date>< GmapID>

Dr. Lee is a great oral surgeon! Our daughter had 4 wisdom teeth removed by him.  She didn't feel any pain during the procedure and she healed very nicely.  The staff was was very helpful and friendly.  They answered all our questions and continue to follow-up to ensure that our daughter is doing ok.  Definitely would recommend Dr. Lee to anyone who is looking for an Oral Surgeon.<//review>

<Text>My experience at this office was amazing. The surgery I underwent was wisdom teeth extraction. They were very careful, friendly and informative before and after the surgery. It was the best oral institution I have ever been to. Nothing less than 5 stars for Dr. Lee :)</Text>< Pics>

<Text>My name is Jim H. and I thought Dr. Lee and his staff were amazing. I have been told for years now to that I have to get my wisdom teeth pulled. Of course I put it off for as long as possible.  I ended up needing to get a molar pulled and decided to to get the wisdom teeth pulled at the same time. My dentist recommended Dr. Lee. That fact that I was going to be  put to sleep at a dentist's office made my wife very nervous. She called the office and was relieved to find out that Dr. Lee was not only a dentist, he was also a certified medical doctor with a very qualified surgical staff.  I decided to have the procedure done through Dr. lee's office and could not have been more pleased with the experience.  I called his office several times with a lot of questions. A few days after the surgery, I was concerned that something was wrong (I was reading to many things about wisdom tooth extraction on the internet).  I called the office and they got me in right away even though I wasn't supposed to return for a follow up visit for 3 weeks.  Dr.Lee examined me and assured me that everything was normal. I was so relieved.  I can not recommend Dr. Lee and his competent staff enough.</Text>< rating>

<rating>5</rating><review>I was also pretty apprehensive about getting my wisdom teeth pulled out, but now that the experience is over, I am really happy to have seen Dr. Lee for the procedure. It was very convenient to have all the procedures (x-ray and surgery) performed in one visitation, especially for a person who has difficulty getting days off from work such as myself. I felt nothing during the procedure itself; any pain I felt during my recovery only was felt for only 2 days. He and his assistants were very nice and thorough in their explanation, even in my follow-up appointments. They are always willing to answer any questions. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Lee and his surgical assistants for any wisdom teeth removal. I will admit, however, that my experience with the front desk was not exactly the best. When the doctor was out of the office for a conference for an additional week, the front desk FAILED to notify me of my cancelled appointment although they received this information from the doctor 3 days prior. If anyone needs verification calls from the office to remind them of appointments, don't expect to receive any. Hopefully you won't need to call them to ask if your appointment has been cancelled.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

At first I was scared when I heard that I had to get my wisdom teeth pulled out but when I stepped inside the office the staff was very friendly and it helped me feel less nervous. Dr. Jeffrey Lee was really nice and made sure I understood the importance of getting my wisdom teeth extracted and the procedure. I chose to get sedated and the surgery went perfectly fine. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lee to everyone!<//Text>

I had a great experience at the Jeffrey Lee office! I thought the office itself was beautifully designed and the staff was very friendly and seemed to work very efficiently. Dr. Lee was straightforward and told me what he was going to do and how. I had two wisdom teeth pulled and I literally felt zero pain after. I was actually kind of worried that I didn't feel anything or have any swelling but better than being in pain! I would definitely recommend Dr. Lee to people looking for a good dentist!<//Review>

When I was referred to an oral surgeon for removal of 4 wisdom teeth, I was really terrified. But on the day I met Dr. Lee I was pacified with his unassuming behavior and professionalism. His clinic set-up is very professional in every way from reception to his assistants. Not to mention that Dr. Lee is not only an oral/maxillofacial surgeon but also certified in medical practice. I really felt I got good, caring and professional care from him and his office staff....highly recommended.<//review>

I was referred to Dr. Lee by my dentist after discovering that I needed to have my wisdom teeth removed. Dr. Lee and his staff are very professional. The procedure was explained and any time I had questions, they were answered. The procedure itself was done quickly and was pretty painless. Unfortunately in my case, I did experience dry socket afterwards, however,  Dr. Lee and his staff have continued to take good care of me and have been wonderful in the process. The only minor issues that I have ever had with the office is that during my first visit, I waited a pretty long time and on a follow up visit there was a scheduling mix up with my appointment but even in light of these minor issues, I find that Dr. Lee and his staff are definitely worth your consideration for any future oral surgery needs- I know that for myself, I will continue to use their office should I have any future oral surgery needs.< /Review>

< Review>
I had a great experience with Dr. Lee.  The surgery was fast and easy. After the first two weeks I got dry socket and the pain was excruciating.  I called Dr. Lee's office and they bent over backwards to get me in that same day. They treated the problem and I had instant relief.  After the treating of the dry socket I had no more problems and healed great. I am so thankful to Dr. Lee and his office staff.  The care and willingness to help is   something that I applaud them for. Thank you!!!</Review>

I love this office! This was my first time here getting my wisdom teeth removed and I was extremely nervous and anxious. The process was explained  thoroughly and the cost was up front which my dad really appreciated. The staff was very comforting and calming and doctor jeffrey lee did an amazing job. I then had to reschedule my follow up appointment about 3 times due to my schedule and health issues and they were very understanding and friendly throughout the whole process. You can definitely tell all the staff members care about their patients. The only thing is I did have to wait a little longer than expected for my appointment to get started, but i wasnt in a rush and the treatment definitely made up for it. I am very happy with my experience here!</text>

Great experience at Dr. Lee's office. Both my teenage sons had all four wisdom teeth pulled.
Dr. Lee was referred by our orthodontist. He is kind and professional. All went well and we had no problems at all. They explained all about the procedure, possible side effects, and after care.
Courteous staff, nice office, short wait time, free wi-fi, accepts insurance.
Quoted from my son "Dr. Lee is a super chill dude."< /text>

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming and service was great! They called and followed up on me after my surgery to make sure I was ok, which was very kind of them. I had my follow-up appointment and everything went well! Definitely would recommend this practice for taking out wisdom teeth!<//Review><UserId.>116145228961309193474< /UserId.>< Response>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I would have rated my experience 10 stars if it were an option! I had 4 days to be ready to travel on business when my wisdom tooth began to give me trouble.  Dr. Lee was able to work me in quickly.  His front office staff was so helpful and professional during the whole process even though it was a rushed situation. Dr. Lee was very gentle and I had very little to no pain after my extraction. His assistants, Jo and Leslie, were knowledgable and called to check on me later that evening and up to a few days after my surgery.  It was truly like a well oiled machine. I am so grateful for their help and service.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Please do not go to this dentist. They are overly priced. I was quoted 4 different prices for the same tooth. The receptionist said that was a one week special and that the prices have changed, I asked her for the updated price, she said 495.00 I said that I will bring my own X-rays in that way it's cheaper, then she says "let me double check the price" she puts me on hold for 28 minutes, I end up calling her back, she says I'm sorry I misread the notes, the total price is 695.00. Mind you last week the price was 386.00... Within a week the price shifted 4 different times! To top it off, I've asked to speak to the doctor 4 times and I have never received a call back. Please do your research before going here. Thank you,< /review>

They have a nice staff, clean office, and a professional doctor. One thing I have to say is that on the day of the operation, it took 2 hours to even get in the operation room (Regardless of having an appointment).<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I had a great experience with Dr. Jeffrey Lee. I was having teeth extraced at my regular dentist office when one tooth became a problem. After they worked on me for over 3 hours they recommended I see Dr. Lee.I was in incredible pain and very upset, but the staff and Dr. Lee made me feel comfortable and relaxed. He was straightforward and told me what he was going to do and how. I had the problem wisdom tooth pulled and I literally felt zero pain the morning after, and within a couple of days almost all of the discomfort was gone. I would also like to add that I thought the office itself was beautifully designed and the staff was very friendly and seemed to work very efficiently.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Lee to people looking for a good dentist!<//Text><Date>1407199757523</Date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>108809487625579358219< /user_id>< gmap_id>

I went into Dr. Lee's office thinking that i would have to suffer through several weeks of pain and discomfort after getting my wisdom teeth removed. However, the procedure was very comfortable and painless and I did not even need stitches! There was no pain at all and I was able to resume eating normal foods at about the third day. I would definitely recommend Dr. Jeffrey Lee for anyone looking to have their wisdom teeth removed.< /Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>After experiencing an extremely painful toothache for about 2 weeks, I went to my dentist who informed me that I had a wisdom tooth infection and referred me to Dr. Lee to have them removed. I called the office a couple of hours later to try to set up an appointment, thinking it would be a week or so before they could get me in. Much to my surprise they told me to come in that same afternoon and they would take a look.
Upon getting x-rays and and taking a look, Dr. Lee performed the surgery in the same afternoon, extracting all four wisdom teeth in a very timely, efficient manner. A process which I thought would take a week ended up taking only a couple hours in total.
Not only was I very impressed and satisfied with the timeliness and speed in which everything was taken care of, I was also extremely pleased with the friendliness and sincerity of Doctor Lee and his entire staff.
Obviously getting four teeth taken out at once is not the best thing in the world, but the environment in which I was able to have the operation done was superb, and I can say with confidence that I highly suggest and recommend this office for anyone needing oral work done.
Thank you again to Dr. Lee and his exceptional staff!</Review>< user_id>

<Review>The staff is very well coordinated and efficient. They took really good care of me during the operation and provided me instructions before my wisdom teeth extraction on how to take care of it. So if you would like any type of wisdom teeth extraction I really recommend people to go here.<//Review>< name>

<resp>None<//resp><Rate>3< /Rate><review>I came to Dr. Jeffrey Lee's office for a procedure to extract my wisdom teeth. I have to say the staff was very professional and helpful. Probably by far, the best staff I've ever seen and been in contact with. Unfortunately, my three star rating is attributed to the misfortune I've faced while in the office. I know Dr. Lee must be a very well-known oral surgeon with the number of patients he has, but it has made every visit difficult. The first visit I remember waiting over an hour in the waiting room because of some complication in the office and found out that they had forgotten about me completely until I came up to the desk again. I do not blame the staff at all for this, but however recommend you see another oral surgeon if you do not have the time to wait. Lastly, I have previously been in contact with other oral surgeons for different procedures. I have to say that Dr. Lee wasn't as sensitive to my issues as I would have liked. I always felt my time with him was very rushed and didn't feel at all welcomed by him, but instead intimidated. Maybe it's because I'm a student and under 20 years of age, but I do see him welcome other older patients with a smile. Also on the day of the surgery, he didn't really seem to acknowledge me. I know he was preoccupied with finding my little veins for the IV, but again I felt no warm presence like I would want with any doctor. This is only my opinion however. Overall, he did do a great job with my procedure. Everything went fine. I only do not suggest him if you cannot wait because he can get very, very busy.</review><Time>1406182454581</Time><UserId.>104191369023912601773</UserId.>< Pics>

I was always pushing back my wisdom extraction because of all the horror stories I've heard. However, after going here I was relieved and super enlightened. Dr lee is a real professional who has the best staff. I was terrified for the painful surgery to the point where I avoided it for years. Dr lee told me from beginning to end what was to happen during surgery. I was literally scared and the staff helped me feel comfortable. They are really good at what they do. They told me upfront all the complications that could occur and were honest. They also explain all the costs and if I wanted to add 02 to my tooth extraction. Which I swear is worth it because after my surgery I felt no pain. I took the pain meds for the first day and didn't need them after. I was totally fine. After the first couple of days I was fine to eat anything and ready to work two days post surgery. This was a great experience. My wounds healed quickly and it feels like I never got surgery. This is great and the staff is amazing. Post check up they care about you really well. I don't know who said the receptionist is not nice because both times they were more than pleasant. If I had to get another oral surgery I would definitely come here.<//Review>

Dr Jeffrey  Lee was awesome.  He made my 4 wisdom teeth extraction as easy and painless as possible.  Matter of fact right before I had the surgery done I thought I would be in alot of pain which the pain  was actually less than what i originally thought.

I recently had a dental issue which required that I see a dental surgeon and my dentist, Dr. Pannu in Costa Mesa, referred me to Dr. Lee.

I had a tooth with an infected root that had to be extracted.  Not a fun procedure by any means, but very necessary.

Dr. Lee’s office set up a prompt appointment for the extraction.  His staff went over details of the procedure with me and what to expect during and after.  His business office pre-verified my dental benefits and explained the details of my coverage and what I was expected to pay out of pocket.

The actual procedure was not painless, but I was given various options of sedation and chose to use only local anesthesia.  If I had to do it over again, I would have probably picked another option.

The procedure itself went very well and, surprisingly, I did not suffer from much pain after the extraction.

I have had many follow-ups after my procedure and each one has gone very well.  I really appreciate the time Dr. Lee has taken with me following the procedure and the professionalism and care of his staff.

I am happy that I my dentist referred me to Dr. Lee.<//text>

Dr. Lee and his staff were incredibly professional and kind. I went in to have my wisdom teeth extracted and had a pleasant experience, no pain or irritation during the procedure whatsoever. I experienced pain after the extraction which is expected but Dr. Lee and his staff was very accomodating and helped me through the healing process. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lee and will be using him in the future for any more dental extractions.<//review>

Dr Lee and his stafff were amazing throughout the entire process. I had a wisdom tooth extraction, and even when there was some pain days after the procedure, they told me come in and they took care of it right away. Everyone there is very professional and courteous, I would refer all my family and friends.</Text>

< Review>
I got a wisdom tooth extracted by another dentist and he was unable to extract all of my roots. He took out 1 out of 3. I was in so much pain for almost 2 months. I could not sleep or eat without pain. I saw 3 different oral surgeons with over 20 years experience and they told me my surgery was very complicated and that I needed to have it done by a USC Oral Surgeon. I called them and they told me it was a 1 year wait before I could make an appt. So finally I go into Bright Now Dental for a consultation and they told me they’re surgeon would be able to do my surgery. I was so exited!! So after waiting 1 month to get my surgery done at Bright Now Dental the surgeon also tells me my case is very complicated and he was sorry but he would not be able to do my surgery. My pain was so intense by that time. So the receptionist at Bright Now Dental recommended i go see Dr. Jefferey she said he’s the only doctor she knows that for sure would be able to do my surgery. She spoke very highly of him! So I went home and called Dr. Jefferey’s office. The girl that helped me I believe her name is Ashley...she was super nice!! She was able to answer all my questions and told me I could get my surgery done as early as that same day! I ended up going the next day. The whole process was smooth.  Everyone there is very nice. Dr. Jeffrey did my surgery and I am back to normal. It’s been 2 months and I’m completely healed. Pain was gone 2 days after my surgery. I highly recommend Dr. Jefferey!!! Thank you soooo much Dr. Jeffrey!! And Ashley for your outstanding customer service!!</Review>

Dr. Lee did a great job. I didn't feel any pain after the first day. The procedure went great, however it was a little pricey. I would recommend this place if you need to get your wisdom tooth out.< /text>

<Text>MY ADVICE IS SIMPLY AVOID GOING TO JEFFREY LEE AT ALL COST! I was referred to Lee's office by my general dentist for a biopsy and as a result, the Mental nerve was permanently damaged. I lost sensation of the lower right side of my face; I lost sensation of my teeth and have the feeling of numbness in my lips 24 hours/day. After the biopsy, he decided to refer me to an endodontist to perform a root canal treatment on two teeth. This endodontist made the ice test and confirmed that the nerve was severed and refused to do the root canal. I don't blame him; he did not want to be a part of this massacre. I later visited three other oral surgeons (maxillofacial) and they all were completely surprised and confirmed that damaging the nerve could have been absolutely avoided if the surgeon was skilled. All three surgeons also unanimously said that the root canal for the two teeth was not the correct treatment plan.
In summary: *You need to know that Jeffrey Lee is so arrogant and does not listen to you. *He never explained the biopsy process and never told me the consequences of the biopsy and the possibility of damaging the nerve. *While sitting in the dentist chair a few minutes before injecting the anesthesia, one of his team members will come over rushing you to sign a bunch of papers to take your legal right away. Do not sign any of these papers without reviewing the details and reading between the lines.  *He works like a machine and does not know what he is doing. *All he cares about is making money not your well being. *The rating system requires at least one star but my fair rating is minus 100 stars because he ruined my life forever.<//Text>< username>

<Text>Very dishonest staff and doctor. Was quoted different pricing even though I have insurance. I called another oral surgeon and was told that Jeffrey lee should have quoted me whatever my insurance contract states even if I am maxed out. Please consider prior going to this office.

I was referred to Dr Lee. I found the office to be exceptional along with his staff. At my first consult, they performed a full xray set which Dr Lee then used to show me my issue. I had no pain but had a lower wisdom tooth pushing in and causing resulting in a cavity. So in order to save my regular doctor referred me to Dr. Lee. Dr Lee was rather harsh about waiting until I was 52 to get this done and highly recommended sleep sedation and because I did not have a ride home, we rescheduled. Because I was going to asleep, a went ahead and had both pulled. OK, for anyone thinking of waiting...  the longer you wait the more pain it will be post operative.  I don't want to scare anyone off, but sooner is defiantly better as I have the upper two done in the 30's and did not have as much pain. The good news is Dr. Lee saw me on sort notice one week after and reassured me, prescribed more pain meds and after my 3 week follow up all is well and I am healing well will little pain. I plan to have my older son of 16 in sometime this year to pull all 4 to save him the aggravation before he goes off to collage. If I ever need any other heavy duty work, I know how to call.< /review>

I'm not really sure one could say they loved getting wisdom teeth removed, unless you love pain or something like that. Of course there is pain in change, but the experience and care is what counts. When i came in, they explained everything. the staff was incredibly kind and i can say i'd definitely recommend him. Great experience.<//Text>

Office is very clean and organized. Office staff is friendly and the Dr. Lee is very knowledgable and professional. I had my wisdom teeth removed and the only thing that I wouls comment on is the wait time. It was supposed to be a 45 minute procedure but I was in there for over 4 hours. The transition times between the x-rays, doctor, office staff talking about payment, and getting to th OR for the actual procedure took quite long. After each person would talk to me, the turn around time before the next person would come was long.< /text>

I recently went into Dr. Jeffery Lee's Office to get 3 wisdom teeth remove about a week ago, i remember being very nervous and scared to get my wisdom teeth pulled out, however the staff was very friendly and helpful, they answered many of my questions and gave me great advice to a fast recovery. Not to mention his office was very beautiful, i recovered sooner then i expected and was very satisfied with my visit to Dr. Lee's Office Thank You.< /Review>

The girls at the front desk are snotty little smart mouths. Rude.
The dental assistants are low skill and un-knowledgeable.
The procedure was crude and painful. This dentist is from the 3rd world and runs his practice as such.
Don't go here.</Text>

<Review>This review is based on my husband's experience. (John. N)

With one tooth bothering me, i was told it was my wisdom tooth. My dentist referred me over to Dr. Lee and he advised me to get all 4 of my wisom teeth extracted. I went ahead and got the procedure done, and i am glad i did. The procedure lasted for an hour and a half and was real painful, a pain i dont want to go through again. Dr.Lee prescribed goods meds that got me through. The staff was helpful and informative, which made the experience easier, I would recommend Dr Lee.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<time>1462595387750</time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I randomly got referred this Oral Surgeon for a 4 wisdom tooth extraction, and it was probably the best thing to happen. Even prior to showing up to the office, I had a wonderful back a forth with a secretary named Jeanina (not sure if that's how her name is spelled). They worked with us to schedule the surgery before my teeth got any more impacted. A very easy to find, clean, and friendly office. My mother who took me to my appointment and home from it, said she is definitely going to use this office again for any future oral surgery business. The pain meds they prescribed have eliminated basically any pain that was bothering me before.
All the assistants were wonderful, especially the one who gave me an x-ray, I called her a great nurse 2 or 3 times post-operation, she wasn't a nurse, but was flattered to hear it.
Anyways, I don't leave reviews often, but this place blew me away and really came through on an operation I was not looking forward to having.
Thank you very much Dr. Lee and Associates.<//Text>< pictures>

They told me to go in as soon as i could, and when i arrived they did x-rays and Dr. Lee clearly explained the procedure he was going to do. He suggested i get all four wisdoms removed and i'm so glad i took his advice and got all four removed so i wouldn't have to go back a second time. I wasn't in pain after the surgery, just a bit of swelling. I would highly reccomend Dr. Lee and his staff to anyone who requires an oral surgeon, and I would go back if i needed to! :)<//review>< Pics>

I went to Dr. Lee because I had a "TMJ Disorder" and his website said he did a fellowship focusing on TMJ.  My jaw was locked to the point that I could only open it two finger widths. Dr. Lee did all that he could to treat it without surgery, which I liked.  He gave me a splint that I wore 24/7 for about 6 months and then just at night as the pain went away.  Every visit I had, Dr. Lee asked me how the pain was.  It was getting better every time.  Now there is no pain and I still wear the splint at night but my bite is very off.  None of my right teeth touch.  I can't rip or tear with my teeth.  My jaw still locks but it unlocks.  My new dentist suggested that I get braces now to realign my bite and hopefully relieve my jaw. I cannot speak on any other procedure that Dr. Lee performs but for problems with TMJ, go somewhere else.  The pain was treated but the problem persisted and led to other problems.< /review>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>Amazing experience. Couldnt be happier with Dr Lee and his very friendly staff like Tinelle for example. Its been a month since procedure and everything has been smooth smooth. Theyre very helpful and cooperate with you on many levels. Even financial. One thing though... I get that its a Doctor's office and certain situations force us to wait longer than expected, so having a flat screen tv ON with some HD movies or Netflix in the waiting room would not be a bad investment. Might help some future patients relief that anxiety. But overall that really did not ruin my experience. They always called and checked up on me to see how I was doing, scheduled me in a couple times to track my progress, which means they really care about their patients. They gave me a sense of security that you dont get from many Doctors. Thats why they deserve the 5 stars. Would defenitely recommend!</Text>< Pictures>

I had a very difficult condition but the Dr succeeded and made it work. However, I visited him twive after the operation for checkup, and I still don't know what's there, what he did, how and why? I'm just very curious about happened around my jaw. I couldn't do it again. I would like to know what's going on.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Honestly the best possible experience I could have expected. Called them in the morning after getting a recommendation from my dentist after experiencing extreme wisdom teeth pain. Front desk was very helpful and told me to come in and they will do their best to make room for me. So I went down there and waited an hour or so and was called in. Dr. Lee checked me out and explained the whole process clearly and then was explained the payment clearly. I had all 4 wisdom teeth extracted, well one ground down, but the whole experience was awesome considering how much pain I was in before. Dr. Lee Did a great job and I hardly had any pain or discomfort if anything after the procedure, I followed his recovery recommendations to the T and I feel great now.

<Name>Teresa Griffin</Name><Date>1620160375263</Date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>Friendly and efficient customer service.  Plenty of space for social distancing.  Everything looked clean and fresh!  I enjoyed my acai smoothie with blueberries, bananas, strawberry and pineapple.  I also got a ginger and lemon shot to boost my immune system.  Cayenne is typically included in the immune booster shot bot I requested to omit it. Will certainly revisit.  Not sure if they have a parking lot but I found street parking which was close and convenient. It was a little pricey but I think worth it!</Text>< pictures>

As soon as I walked in I was greeted.  Everyone smiled at us.  The place was clean, smelled great. Had a cool sink where they wash their produce so you know it's clean. Met the mom and her sons.  They let us try beetnik sample which tasted great.  I highly recommend the kale greens smoothie.  Tasted great and boosted my energy!  Good job guys!<//Review>

The Acai bowls here are really tasty. They fill me up quickly.  I'm not a fan of their empanadas but glad they offer them to give the menu a little variety.  The place is always clean and the staff is really friendly.< /review>

Acai P bowl is delicious 😋. Loove the taste. Nice staff, clean, good amount of seats.  I've only gone in the evening and Sunday's. There is always parking in front during those times, or I've just been lucky the last several times 😁. Only thing,  sometimes it melts so quickly that I have to eat it there. I prefer to take it home to chill 😋 Other places last a good 15 min before they start to get soft... ( I love acai bowls lol) I tried to make it home with this one.. 8 min drive ended up being a smoothy practically lol buttt still love their acai bowls😋</Text>

Never had a problem with any of my framing needs here.    They've already gotten a couple of projects from me.  Each one costing about $500 or $400 respectively.  Not cheap.  They do things right.  Great customer service.<//Text>

This place was such an authentic place. I loved the atmosphere and the lady at the cash register (the owner I believe) was such a kind lady. My favorite kind of ice cream is green tea, and this was by far the best green tea  ice cream I've ever had!<//review>

What distinguishes this branch from the others is the people who own it and run it. Z and AJ are super warm and welcoming and have my usual order memorized. Their delicious acai bowls and green blends are to die for (you can tell they use the freshest high quality ingredients) and will energize you for the day. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area looking for healthy food options that taste like comfort food.<//Text>

First time going here, the barista was super friendly and helped me choose the right coffee I needed for staying awake. The coffee was honestly some of the best I've had in a while, and it's in a good location if you're a USC student.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I like that it looks very clean, I have never bought but I have seen some drinks and they look tasty.

My 90 year old mother was brought into the emergency room this past week. Every person we came in contact with, from the admitting station to the nursing staff, from the doctors to the test technicians were exceptional and put her at ease. They were extremely professional in analyzing her condition and compassionate. This was our first experience with Placentia Linda hospital since we live out of the area, but I am very grateful for for their excellence.< /Text>

< review>
I really loved the level of attention I received at Placentia -Linda Hospital, Dr Lu and all the nurses were always very polite and caring. Melisa my Nurse was fantastic and she was willing to help with minute of request. Is not fun to be sick but definitely having the best medical staff always makes anyone feel better.</review>

I took my 6 yr old because he had a little accident & hit his head playing with his brother. Bottom line, we went here & it was super fast, staff super nice & friendly. He got stitches & a CT scan everything done within an hour. Also want to say THANK YOU for what you guys are doing for us during this pandemic. ❤️</Text>

I have been to at least 10 hospitals throughout orange county and the inland empire and this is by far the best hospital I’ve ever been to. They have a check in system so you can check in online ahead of time for an emergency room visit. It makes things so much faster. They are incredibly fast despite this. I was there today and they took me in immediately into a room, my nurse was there within a minute, no more than five minutes later the doctor was there talking to me, and no more than five minutes after that I had meds already. Everybody was very kind and respectful and took care of me as usual. The doctor listened to me and got me the right meds the first time. It was amazing. Best ER visit I’ve ever had. If I ever need to go to a hospital and I’m close enough to go here I come here.< /Text>

Everyone along the way was awesome: That includes security, er greeter, admitting clerk, ekg tech, radiology transport, the nurses and doctor. They were all pleasant and efficient. They operated as a team to get us speedily through the work up and make a diagnosis and institute treatment. Was thoroughly impressed by their efficiency and kindness as was my mom.  They kept us updated with the plan including labs and radiology results. Special kudos to nurse Christa Gayton and Dr Eric Quimbo. Everyone went out of their way to make our visit smooth and our visit welcoming.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1618833146231, 'text': "Lynne, thanks so much!

I always chose this facility to have a yearly routine mammogram. It's easy to make an appointment, check -in was fast and easy. Due to Covid-19, they do check your temperature before you can get in the hospital or clinic. Also, social distancing is seriously implemented here. All seats in the waiting room are 6ft apart, sanitizer provides in multiple locations... Very clean facility.
Staff was friendly and helpful. X-ray technician was professional and well trained.
Would definitely recommend and will be returning if needed.</review>

my dad got covid really bad so we took him to the hospital and they said he was going to stay and we though oh he’s going to get better in days. we called the hospital every day and they said he  was doing good it just takes longer for someone older to recover. not once did they called to say he was doing bad. they didn’t called us to say he went to the icu. they only called us to say he  passed. who’s knows what they did to him because he was doing good and i was expecting him to come home. me and my family are in shock. then said he passed away at this time then they changed it. what the heck? they didn’t even let us speak to the doctor because he was busy. i wish i never took him to this hospital.<//Text>

they said my family member was doing good and was recovering and they didn’t let us see him,and one day they just called us to say hepassed. just like that. they didn’t call to say he went to the icu or anything. they didn’t call to say he was doing bad or was getting worse. every time we called we asked to speak to the doctor but they always said he is busy. some of the nurses didn’t like that we asked questions. but the fact that they didn’t call us to say he was getting worse and that she went to the icu. we didn’t even see him for so long and we were expecting him to come home and just like that. if your family member has covid don’t take them here please don’t make the mistake we made.<//Text>

Update 12/2/2020. The hospital responded to my email and is working on my concerns. Placentia-Linda has exceptional doctors and nursing staff. My one star rating is for the administrative staff and billing department. For 25 years my family has utilized the services of this hospital from the birth of our children, to orthopedic procedures, and other medical needs, both minor and major.  In all cases we were very happy. The most recent visit occurred in May 2019 for a CT scan.  The hospital billed both my primary and secondary insurance, both of whom paid. When it was my turn to pay my portion, an error in the billing to the insurance was discovered.  The hospital and Anthem went back and forth for over a year. I got involved and during a three way call Placentia Linda admitted the billing error, made the correction, and confirmed a zero balance.  I was informed I would be getting a statement confirming the payment.  Two weeks later the statement arrived with an even larger balance. I attempted to reach out to the billing manager (no response) and the hospital administrators office (they responded but never followed up).  Again the doctors and nursing staff are the best; however, the administrators and lack of communication by them and the billing department will cause me hesitation in considering a visit to this hospital in the future.< /review>

<Review>Came in for pain, saw a doctor for less than 5 minutes. She prescribed me penicillin and strong ibuprofen. Found out I was charged over $3,000 for the "service," and I have been fighting between insurance companies, the hospital, and medical billing for 2 months now. At one point I was on hold with medical billing for 2 hours. I been bouncing back between so many departments and at this point I have no idea what I owe but one thing is for certain, $3,000??? For what? Penicillin? Give me a break. Next time I'm just going to risk it and wait until morning for an urgent care to open.< /Review><rating>1< /rating><Gmap_id>0x80dcd404b52e2c0f:0xf9ec80b5729f9ff3<//Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< username>

<text>The nursing staff was amazing during the time my dad was there due to a cardiac arrest. Unfortunately my dad did not make it and passed away. However, this hospital tried to say that my dad died from COVID-19 on his death certificate. He was tested multiple times for COVID and would come back negative. They even allowed us to be at his bedside. Why they were trying to falsely claim COVID?? I don't know but it's sad that hospitals are doing this. I sure as hell made sure to call and get the matter fixed and even the staff didn't understand why COVID was listed as the reason for his passing since none of his records indicated it. Very upsetting.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><GmapID>0x80dcd404b52e2c0f:0xf9ec80b5729f9ff3< /GmapID><Resp>{'time': 1610574850740, 'text': "We're sorry to hear this, Michelle.

<Review>You will continue to get bills (that you have already paid) till you die. I have come to this hospital twice and both times they have billed my insurance with duplicate claims. I have spent HOURS disputing what seems like an obvious mistake on their part. The service is rushed and the billing will take you back to the 60s. Be prepared to spend the rest of your life reliving the poor decision to visit Placentia Linda.</Review>< date>

Treated more for covid, that I didn't have. I had some treatment for my copd and chest x-rays done.  I came out worst than when I went in and with no answers to why I did.  Also I was sent to a nursing home in anaheim, ca. that I wouldn't send a person I disliked to.  I am trying to use the nicest words I can to say what was one of the worst times in my life. I know others will and have had worst than me, i hope things get better for you all going from here.< /Review>

<userid>108890725721104785663</userid><Text>I've never written a review on anything so it says alot that I am doing this.
My review is based only on my billing from this hospital (the staff was very nice and professional).
I went in to get checked for possible appendicitis and was there approx. 2-3 hours with some of the time waiting for the CT scan, EKG and blood work to come back. No appendicitis, no surgery and my bill came back at over $26,400.
My insurance paid some and I'm left with a bill of nearly $4,000, part of which is a deductible.
When I questioned the billing with an employee, it came across as normal and there was no room to negotiate the prices of what felt like extremely outrageous and inflated charges.

Just putting it out there for people so you know what you may expect... that's not a typo, $26,400 for 2-3 hours with no surgery.</Text>< GmapID>

All the staff was super friendly and nice. I went in for a surgery that was very emotionally draining for me. They made the process so much easier for me. Ryan at the intake desk was super nice and informative. All the nurses were so helpful. I had my own room while there. The process was fast. I liked that it was a small hospital because it wasn’t as hectic and the nurses checked on you every five minutes. Thank you so much for making this process so much easier for me.<//Text>

I normally go to St Judes because it’s only 4 min away from my home but one day I decided to come to Placentia Linda due to major life threatening complications and I must say it’s the absolute very best decision I could have ever made. They got me in right away I didn’t wait long exhausting hrs to be seen and from the ER to being admitted I received the top of the line quality care one could ever ask for. All of the medical team was so kind, patient and knowledgeable. Their bedside manners was superb and their infection control cleanliness was soooooo good I felt so safe and comfortable.  Thank you everyone at Placentia-Linda for going above and beyond to save my life!!!!</review>

I entered the Emergency facility around 3:30 pm with bleeding from a tooth that was extracted days prior.  The entire staff was attentive, compassionate, and very up on the COViD-19 protocols.  From Randy the check-in clerk to Ron the nurse and to the Doctors, including Dr. Pohoinak, they were amazing.  I also observed how they served other patients and they got the same care, kindness and consideration I received.  Thank You Placentia-Linda.< /text>

< review>
I had the best nurse ever, a young energetic young man name Kyle. I could not believe he had only been nursing for one year. I am from a medical family and Kyle had an extrordinary amount of knowledge for one year of nursing. Kyle was always eager to help out and came running every time I pushed my nurse button. I predict that that this young man will make a serious impact on the medical future whatever direction he chooses to go!<//review>

DOU 105
was transferred in from a different hospital for an angiogram. This was the best hospital experience I’ve had thanks to my nurse Vickey and Sarah. They made sure I was comfortable and all my needs met and taken care of. Made the time go by fast and ease your mind.

<time>1502826898045<//time><Review>Was in the hospital three times in short span of time in June/July time period. The care I received from the nursing staff (all shifts) was amazing. They were all very caring and gracious (even at 3:00am). I would recommend this hospital on their nursing staff alone were it necessary. However the doctors and quality of care for the entire staff are wonderful. Thank you for caring for me. P. Martin< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>Been to several hospitals for the past 4 years,  my dad gets sick a lot so we usually go to a medical center/ hospital/ ER in Fullerton and I was impressed with their service until I came to Placentia-Linda Hospital for a surgery. The service , the staff everyone was so helpful, knowledgable, your ring the bell they come to you immediately Lorin and Tatiana were my nurses and  they were awesome , They ask you questions and they just wanted to make sure I am comfortable. Only little feed back, the other nurse Virginia she needs to pay more attention to medicine times and also listen to the whole question before she answers. Thanks Placentia-Linda Hospital. Btw there on time from check in, put me in my room and then then surgery time.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating>< name>

Very poor care provided by nurses and Doctors in the ER. Patient released with high blood pressure, dizzy and weak. Severely lacking in the ability to assess, analyze and treat. Patient was returned and admitted to the hospital the following day with a severely worsened condition, only to find that the hospital holds the same Non-proffessional, non-caring demeanor. We all understand the difficulties associated with human interaction,  but they would definitely benefit with a course in human kindness. Beware!!!< /text>

If I could give it zero stars, I would.  Although the Hispanic gentleman who took my ID was very sweet.  I went in, like I have for years to get pain management for my ulcerative colitis, and they shoved a tube in my nose and down my throat, making me dry heave, only make making the pain in my stomach 10% worse.  So they gave me IV Tylenol and took a useless chest X-ray ( that I’m sure is going to cost me a fortune). All because I just moved back to Yorba Linda and had no on to pick me up.  They treated me like a junky, looking for a fix.  Pick anywhere else.  Please.<//text>

My brother was admitted for substance overdose-Suicide, and my mother was with him most of the time. Staff and nurses kept preventing from releasing current information; gave my mother the run around of procedures. At some point she was not allowed to see him although she had already been by his side. I was on the phone with my mother most of the time as I was not able to physically support her in her need. My brother was there for more than 10 hours before he was seen by a "counselor" and they still couldn't tell my mother when he was going to be admitted to another location, they kept him on tranquilizers but yet said they were waiting for him to wake up?! (I do admit, he became a nuisance and was giving meds (( 3 doses within an hour!)) as he woke up wanting to go home and asking when was he going to be seen by an actual doctor). He was also restrained at some point and boy does he have dramatic bruising on his body including the area were he had the needle for meds; HIS ARM WAS BENT KNOWING HE HAD A NEEDLE and he kept complaining about it! Anyways, sorry for going off topic... The fact is, when he was released to another facility my mother was never called... so she learned about the transfer at the hospital... My mother asked to speak with a supervisor and was told by female staff "K** N.- Director" was not available and she was not contacted because the nurses had been rotated for their shift (My opinion; lack of communication among peers if this was true) and was not sympathetic at all.

I completely understand and respect any title within a hospital, as they put their health at risk, but it shouldn't give them the right to make anyone feel ignorant or dull under any circumstance, my mother felt that way along with impotence or hopeless under this whole unfortunate event and the staff at this hospital made her feel this way when it should of been comfort of more at ease knowing my brother was in good hands. I speak on behalf of my mothers experience.</review><Name>E Crown< /Name></record></dataset><record>

I have been a patient at Placentia Linda Hospital several times. For my surgery, the intake staff were polite and attentive, including the billing office! My anesthesiologist took extra time to address my special needs, which has never happened before, and when I needed her after surgery she came immediately when called. My nurse was almost always at my side. The whole experience was excellent. I also have had 2 procedures at Rose Imaging where the staff and technician took care of me with exceptional kindness and professionalism. I know, I worked as an RT in hospitals in another state in the 70's. I'm hard to please!< /text>

I just had visited here, due to the fact I have no free-time during regular hours and have had an infected finger for over a month. First the doctor was very rude and had major attitude issue. She immediately dismissed me before even actually looking at anything and told me it was all in my head yet weeks ago the doctor had said I definitely had a problem and just earlier it have been leaking dark yellow pus. After being sent away on medication that was supposed to fix it, one that I was already on and was doing nothing, I got to my car to realize I had left a bag. I turn back for the bag and when I got back asked to check the room I was in. This was no more than eight minutes maximum after I left. I was denied it the ability to do so. Then I asked for security cameras to prove that happened and was denied. I feel a little argument security came out to allow me to check the room. But now I had been over 20 minutes, whatever they wanted was gone because my bag was not there. They then refuse to do anything more or give me anyone else's contact. This is absolutely unacceptable!!!! I expect to be contacted!</review>

I regrettingly went to Placentia Linda wound care at 1041 e Yorba Linda Blvd suite #203 Placentia,ca 92870! Now I’m being scammed from Placentia Linda hospital for $3,267.52 for a hospital facilities fee! The doctor visit was only 20 mins long! Dr Saif Siddiqi cleaned the wound and put some cream and gauze on it! I still haven’t received his bill and I still have another facility fee bill for my 2nd visit and a dr saif siddiqi fee! This is a scam and destroying people’s lives paying this ridiculous fees for 20 min visits! Stay away from this place unless you want to be hit with major facilities fees! I’m so glad I canceled my 3rd visit, this is so very sad that Placentia-Linda hospital scams innocent patients of these ridiculous facilities fees, the bill is so vague with no details on how the my charged nearly $3,300 just for facilities fees for a 20 min visit! I was never admitted into the hospital, never used any part of the facility, 20 min visit is going to cost me $3,300 plus I still have to pay Dr Siddiqi to clean a wound, add cream with some gauze! Don’t come here for any services!<//Review>

<Text>I brought my elderly mother into the ER because she was experiencing a lot of pain. We were new to the area, and had not been established with any doctors yet. At first I was very impressed with the care my mother was getting, so much more efficient than doctors back in New Hampshire. However, they never asked what my mother takes for medication. She was prescribed a couple of medications by the doctor and sent home. After a few days my mother was complaining of being dizzy, and falling a lot. I was getting scared. I went online and checked drug interactions with the medications she normally takes, with the medications the doctor prescribed in the ER. I discovered there was a severe interaction with one of the medications!! The staff at this hospital need to be more careful when it comes to making sure they know what medications patients are taking, before prescribing anything to them. This mistake could have cost my mother's life.</Text>< Pics>

I would give no stars on this hospital.  Simply rude and moody staff.  Staff had no compassion and always in a rush.  And when my family asked for something they rolled their eyes and seem they were bother.  My love one went to the bathroom on her self many times because no one  bother to come.  Simply awful.   Do not come here.  Not professional and stressful.  Go to StJude or kaiser< /text>

Husband had severe back/hip pain come on suddenly over the night. He couldn't walk let alone get up without help and uncomfortable sleeping for him. THEY were recommended by another urgent care and is super fast and helped us right after registering in..pain meds kicked in and I would recommend this hospital for anyone needing medical services!!</Review>

< Review>
Needed a chest x-ray just to confirm I didn't have TB for some volunteer work I do, so I went to the local walk-in place and they said they'd do it for $105 but to check with the imaging centers affiliated with my insurance to see if they'd do it for less.  So I went to Placentia Linda imaging center and the nice lady at the check-in desk said it would be $85 (I think it was...that's close) so of course I had it done there, instead of the walk-in place for $105.  A month later I get a bill for about that from the Radiologist that "read" the x-ray and issued the report.  Then a month after that I get a bill from the hospital for over $300 ! ! !  I complained but still had to pay it....
Bottom Line: DO NOT TRUST WHAT THEY TELL YOU WHEN YOU CHECK IN!</Review>

<review>Very poor hospital. Billing department is very poor. They charge you and then refund you half the amount and bill you again for the entire amount. If you email the management, they do not entertain any response. DO NOT GO HERE. This has happened to us twice. They will charge incorrectly to the Insurance Provider and HARRASS you mentally by sending bills at home which you do not owe.</review><resp>{'time': 1547616848926, 'text': 'Thank you for reaching out, Vishal.

<Date>1552078802510</Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>I'd rate it no stars but I couldn't post this otherwise. My boyfriend was having breathing issues so we took him to Placentia Linda's ER we had to wait over an hour just to get his x-rays of his chest even though he had TWO asthma attacks and was having chest pains in the waiting room, all they did was give him breathing treatment and sent him home. The next day we had to go back because he couldn't breath again, he was VERY worried about the bill but I convinced him to go, when we got there and he was being checked out the nurse asked why he didn't have an inhaler, when he told her we couldn't afford it she replied with "if you don't have money why are you here" staff is super rude, we had to wait an extra two hours for the doctor to bring him his prescription and when we asked for water they didn't bring it until we were leaving. Before leaving the second time we spoke with someone about the billing who knew we were struggling and we needed info on getting him insurance. They told us he had medical and both days were taken care of, all we had to do was sign to confirm and today we got two bills that total to almost $2,000. Horrible hospital, they honestly should be shut down, my boss once told me about when she went to get surgery here and they mixed her up with someone else... You're a hospital do your job? After everything we went through here we still don't know what was wrong with my boyfriend. Shut Placentia Linda DOWN< /text>< pics>

<Text>From the admissions process (Christine) to lab, x-ray, and outpatient surgery I could not be happier with the care I received.  In the outpatient surgery department Debra, Marylou, and all other staff were professional and caring.  After my procedure I was assisted by a CNA named Mary and a RN named Christina, both were excellent!</Text>< UserId.>

My young adult son recently had to go to emergency after experiencing chest pain and left arm weakness.  I went with him for support.
PRO:  We were in and out in an hour and a half.
CONS:  The people that work there (except doctor) are not compassionate or nice.  They don't smile and are not friendly.
The staff at the check out counter collected a bogus $25 copay from us, although the insurance card clearly states no copay if within 24 hours of emergency, which it was.  Even questioning it they insisted we owed it.   He has tried calling billing since then and cannot get through to get a refund.  Manager Cynthia will not return calls.  We will file dispute with credit card.</review>

<text>Came here for a hand injury and they have kept me beyond my will now since Wednesday. They told me I would have received better care if I was a homeless person and could have gone home by now. They have made multiple mistakes and errors and given a lot of inconsistent information all to just give apologies and have no accountability. I wish I would have read the reviews but in a state of emergency I just called 911 and this is where they took me in the ambulance and now I'm being falsely imprisoned. Medical patients beware this hospital is not doing correct medical practices under the state of California. Read about the AMA Act and the torts law I am currently still waiting for a patient advocate after they first said they have no one. They have now denied me to even see my pregnant wife after they let me see her up till they made mistakes and even let her spend the night and now they keep changing everything. I have no record  of crime or abuse or self-harm. To be unlawfully detained  is completely illegal  and unwarranted in this situation . For coming in for an injury this is all very extreme and I am extremely scared for my life right now.</text>< Rating>

<review>After waiting an hour for surgeon to arrive from another hospital, they did not even have the OR ready. Seemed ill equipped to handle a patient with a complex medical history. Filed a request for a pathology report but the discharge nurse never bothered to submit it. comments made to my child during her stay by some nursing and other staff were completely unprofessional.

<Review>My family and I visited this ER 4 times. The first three times went great; we were treated with respect and attention.

The fourth visit, HOWEVER, they ignored my daughter for more than an hour after allocating her a room! It was yesterday and I could not stand what happened! Not a single doctor bothered to come and look at her ears! I had to leave them in the middle of the visit and decided to take my daughter to a better place where doctors take care of their patients in a timely manner. In St. Jude ER, she was taken care of promptly and diagnosed her with ear infections in both of her ears and prescribed her a strong antibiotic. Meanwhile, the Placentia-Linda ER sent a different antibiotic to CVS without any doctor examining her ears; they just took an X-Ray of her chest and said "respiratory infection" over a voice message after we are gone! I told the doctor who was taking care of her at St. Jude ER and was told to NOT take it for my daughter! You could've been better!

If it wasn't for the last bad experience, I would've rated them as a 3 or 4 star ER!

Update:
They got from my insurance over than 2000 dollars and they want me to pay 100! I sent you an email, but they didn't respond!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd404b52e2c0f:0xf9ec80b5729f9ff3</Gmap_id>< name>

All of the staff members at this hospital are warm, kind and provide excellent care.  I have had my father at this hospital several times and it is always a positive - family like experience.  Last Sunday my father was rushed to the ER, not only were his needs met with exceptional care, but also the needs of others.  I could hear the nurse or nurse assistant consoling a patient who was a domestic abuse victim.  This nurse was so kind to this woman, that my sister and I were in tears.

Now my father has been in the hospital for a few days, the staff is always smiling and trying to be kind and helpful.  I would highly recommend this hospital.< /Text>

Everything at this hospital seems to be outsourced - bills come months and months after the visit from a variety of different collection agencies and none of them seem to have a clue about the details of procedures done at this hospital, which makes working with insurance a nightmare. I was admitted quickly for a 2nd degree burn but was then left in a bed listening to the wailings of 4 other people in pain, all crammed into the same emergency room on beds divided by curtains. Finally after waiting in bed for about 1 hour, a doctor came in and spoke directly to the nurse, not to me. After that, another nurse came with instructions for me from the doctor and then left. Nobody even said when I was free to go, so eventually after waiting another 40 minutes, I just got up and walked out. For that sub-par experience, my insurance company and I have been charged upwards of $13,000.</Text>

Warning!!  STAY AWAY!!  The emergency room put me in a soiled room and charged me over $6k and all they did was basic lab work, which they didn't go over with me and which wasn't even the testing I was hoping to get.  I was there about 3 hours and almost all of that time was just waiting for lab results.  I disputed the billing, followed up multiple times with no response before getting another bill.  I called again and found out that my dispute was denied but they wouldn't provide me any documentation on that.  No I'm doing a formal complaint thru my insurance co.  Oh, almost forgot, the $6k, doesn't include the doctor or lab tests, those were billed separately< /text>

<text>They have ONE radiologist to perform a treatment and he works ONE day every other week.  You have to schedule an appointment to see him to discuss the treatment ordered by your doctor THEN you schedule an appointment for the treatment.  Of course, this pushes your treatment out 4 weeks because you accommodate his limited schedule.  Unbelievable.</text>< pics>

My sister was there yesterday for a simple urine diagnosis. She asked many times how much it will cost and they refused to tell her and she said them if it costs more than hundreds she’s not interested. Because she felt bad she did it. The final bill was 1445$. She said that will not pay so much one time cause have no money with her. They said that will call the police, that this is America not your country and have to pay money here and if you are poor don’t come to us and other racist things the day after I called them and they said that is 4000$ bill on her name and she already paid 300$. And we wanted to pay 1045 in 3 months but now...   . No customer service. If you’re not a rich American don’t go there<//Text>

This review has to do with the emergency room.  My husband went there a few months and is still dealing with them over there very inflated billing and other issues.  They charged him over $6k for some lab work and putting him in a room for about 3 hours.  The room was soiled that they put him in and that seems to be a common occurrence from what I see on Yelp.  He's been asking for a complete breakdown of their charges since 9/4/18 to see what he's been charged for but still hasn't received anything.  He finally spoke to the hospital administrator Cheryl in mid November but she was uncaring and promised she would send the cost breakdown in 2 to 3 days but he never received anything explaining the over inflated charges.  Only go here if you have great insurance and don't mind dirty rooms.<//review>

ER was fine, but once admitted it took 3 hours for treatment...wouldn't even give me water.  Not one doctor on staff at night.  NONE...so calls had to be made for approval of my treatment.  I was in horrible pain and the two night nurses were rude, unsympathetic and then we're pissed when a complaint was made....day nurses were nicer but in 3 days I spoke with the doctor a total of 15 minutes.   Terrible hospital all together.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
How about I came in the Emergency at 3 am this morning with a 10+ headache thinking and praying it was not serious, the doctor never told me his name was not consernco about anything I was going through or feeling and just said I'll give u a MRI and asure u it's not anything. Got the MRI sat in the room 3 hours never not 1 time did ANYONE COME AND CHECK MY VITALS CHECK ON ME NOT SAY ONE WORD TO ME . I was wondering is it cause I was a black woman. So I walked out and left I ask the same doctor before I left did he get the results back he said NOT YET BUT U CAN GO IF U WANT, I SAID WELL U ALREADY SAID U ASSURE THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH ME. SO I CALLED AFTER A FEW hours after I got home from a nightmare experience and they told me they could not even give me my results I have to fill something out and wait for it in the mail. I said do if I'm bleeding inside my head u can't tell me?? Like this place needs to be shut down. None of the ppl were nice at all and looked at me as if I was a other from another earth. Worst hospital I ever been to in my life< /Review>

I normally bring my daughter and it's a nice gem, a community secret. The staff is normally sweet and the doctor (not very involved ) is nice and super friendly...
BUT as my luck should have it, I ended up with Darren Hom, MD, and I was NOT happy.
Their mission statement is "Quality health care with a personal touch," he added his personal touch... jerk. Very rude and unprofessional. As he was explaining things to me like I was ignorant and had the IQ of a brick, he turned his back to me and walked out of the room.
I could grumble about the rest of the experience but the RN was a doll. So, if you visit, be mindful and expect to be treated terribly if you have the horrid Dr. Darren Hom.<//text>< pictures>

The ER Doctor that attended to us has no bedside manners, he was rude and obnoxious.  I was asking a lot of questions and he gets annoyed being questioned.  I am a RN myself and when my patient's family asked me questions I answer them and if I can't answer I get someone to help me.  This ER Doctor at Placentia Linda Hospital doesn't want to be questioned and was not gracious enough to answer my questions.  His name is DR. HOM and he wasn't nice to me, maybe, because I am Asian or I am female.  Dr. Hom if you can't answer my questions, get someone  to help you.  Stop being discriminating just because I'm Asian, or you have problem because I'm a female. I give that ER Doctor---  Dr. Hom a one star for poor customer service.

He was not worth my $150 co pay for this ER VISIT.

5 stars for the ER RN, her name is CYNDY BEAR.  She was worth my $150 co pay in the ER.  She gave my husband and me information that the ER Dr. Hom could not  answer.  She taught my husband ways to relieved the pain on his knee and educated my husband on the anatomy of the knee and pathophysiology of a torn meniscus.   The best part of her education to us was the surgery how it will correct it and the recovery time after surgery.

That RN exceeds my expectation, she was awesome.  That ER Doctor, Dr. HOM should be taught what are bedside manners and customer service.

The RN gave quality healthcare with a passionate touch.  Thank you CYNDY Bear RN .</Text>

<text>UPDATED:
After getting a post on this message board from an employee of Placentia-Linda Hospital I reached back out to them to see if they would reduce some of these outrageous charges.  It turns out that that the post on this site was just a public relations post from them, and they never had any intentions of providing me with a fair deal.  In the end, people trust hospitals and the medical system and thus they would never think twice about a hospital ripping them off and taking advantage of them, especially at their most vulnerable moment.  The "manager" that I spoke with ultimately said after investigation on my file the charges were fine, and that they can charge what they want as there are no laws or regulatory boards for the charges and costs they bill.  They are SCUM bags at the highest level, taking advantage of vulnerable people that trust the system.  In other industries this type of abuse or usury is punishable and illegal, but since they are in the medical industry they get to do what they want.    The sad reality is most people won't read this post until after they get burned because as I mentioned people have an inherit trust for medical institutions.
Original Post:   I was charged $12,927 for a nurse to give me an IV and to run a cat SCAN.  I had a sinus infection and they wanted to look further into it, so they ran a CAT Scan.  I also got a separate bill from the Dr. that wasn't included in these figures.   Upon disputing the bill I was informed they can charge what they want for the services they provide.  When I researched the costs of the tests they ran the standard hospital costs were  $250-$300 for blood tests and liver tests and they are charging $1,600 for the 2.    For CAT Scans average costs are $1,200 and they charged $3,500, which they double billed to make it $6,500.  Their attitude toward the billing and disputing is what is most disturbing.  Essentially I was told "it is what it is" and we can charge what we want and you can not dispute whether or not you agree with the costs.  The care was average, and the costs were extremely unfair and unethical.</text><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

<rating>1</rating><review>I am suppose to take my wife for a relatively minor procedure next week to Placentia-Linda Hospital. After reading the reviews (Thank You Google!), i will contact the billing dept. to make sure what's covered by our ins. & what's not?
It is interesting as how this facility has averaged 31/2 stars, which is above the average. What is looks suspicious w/most  5 stars reviews, are unnamed, avatars of 5 years ago & those of recent dates, use generic terms, i.e. doctor good, nurse good, place clean....etc.,where as "REAL" patients with negative review give extensive details of their experience at the Hospital. BTW, what's the term "Guest Relation"?If the job's done right first time, there's no need to contact the "Guest Relation Dept." Once these issues are explained to me, i will change my rating, which i must give!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I would give it a 0 star if I could.

Went in for horrible pain/swelling in wrist; they re-did x-rays that I had done 3 weeks ago to just tell me its "fine" go home and see your orthopedic. I would have seen my ortho, but he was booked and I can't pick up a cup with out pain, I can't sleep, and had to call in to work. What a waste of time and money.

The least they could have done was ACTUALLY looked at my wrist and could have seen the swelling, popping, clicking/ grinding noise... What a joke.< /Text>

I went in with pain in my abdomen and had an MRI done. To my surprise  I was diagnosed with a  fibroids on my uterus.  Being that I DONT HAVE A UTERUS  I was shocked. Since I was given the report I have been trying to reach every director in the facility I could because no one is getting back to me with an explanation on what happened. Here I till 7 days later no one is calling me back. Shameful and so irresponsible for any medical facility much less a hospital!<//text>

Doctor Darren bob-Nuy Hom was a JOKE..!
I went the the emergency room twice this week
He was the doctor in charge at the time I arrived.

After a couple of x-rays of my knee he invented that I had some type of bacteria that was eating my skin.
And I'm saying he invented it all because all they did was to take x-rays and how can a doctor diagnose a bacteria with a simple X-ray right?
But he sent me home just like that knowing that the pain at that point was almost out of control, I was almost crying from the extreme pain and he said, there's nothing I can do just go home and take your medicine and he gave me some pain killers..

2 nights after I went back because the pain was just increasing by the hour and the medicine he gave me wasn't working AT ALL.., This time there was Female doctor she was nice and she was the one who did blood work and some other exams, but then Dr, Nuy Hom came to take place and the first thing he said was, the only thing we can do here is to give a phone number for an specialist and he proseeded to discharge me knowin that I was stil high from the pain medication the gave me when I came in..
I wanted to ask him questions but he said HOLD ON and walked away after 10 minutes waiting he sent his assistance and told me to leave because there was nothing else to talk about..
sad story but very honest, I went home driving and High but at that moment I felt disrespected and frustrated.. I'm thinking I should get some type of profesional advise..< /text>

<Text>Not happy at all, I should read the all the feed back before sign the paper.  I was questioning the front desk and they said will get back to me but they never get back to me. They just busy doing other papers. No customer service/ coutersy. I'll stay away from this hospital network ever. Bad experience in ER room, they recommend to go choc hospital. They told us it's because there's no pediatrician in the house ! How come ??? It was on dec 31 2016. Maybe they don't have main doctor in the house that day. My son it's 15 years old, regular good doctor should be good enough to handle him not pediatrician. And They should know what happened After they doing a lot of test, scannings in there. After went to choc hospital and stayed 1 night in there They found nothing on my son. Ending up with higher 2 hospital bill to deal with. Try to ask for discount up to  6 months but no considaration, their charity program it's almost impossible, it's all because only 1 time incidents. So, it will not be qualify on the out of pocket expenses. On the other hand, the other hospital was really helpful, on their charity program.. much easier to qualify after back and forth sending proof of income paper,etc... resulting, they cut Half of the hospital bill. If I knew what will happen, I should just go straight to the other hospital straight instead just bouncing around and ending up paying 1 bill instead only 1.

Not very happy and very sad patient ( parent )

I went to their ER twice in one week.  Once by ambulance. Sent home in pain both times with what they called sciatic pain. Two days later went to St. Joe's and was admitted where I received the care I needed.  Got an MRI and needed surgery.  Placentia Linda was a waste of money and time. Please don't go to this ER unless you like wasting your time and money.</text>

Worst experience ever!!! Extremely rude, disrespectful and awful nurses with bad attitudes! Especially the night nurses! Instead of doing there jobs they just stood around and talked to each other. What I hated most about this experience is that when I went to ask for a cup of water and a blanket for my family member that was rushed into this ER. The nurse rudely told me that she will but when I asked my family member if they ever brought him the cup of water or blanket he said that they never did and no doctor nor nurse ever went over what his condition was.  NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN!! This ER is not family friendly and they have very bad people skills.<//Review>

I brought my husband to the hospital in May 2015 because he was urinating blood. They did a cat scan and was told he had diverticulitis when he had bladder cancer which the cat scan clearly shows. He died on January 17th 2016 from bladder cancer. I have just received a bill and when I called Melissa Palm the adminastrator and Fred Voltaro thery told me to pay the bill or sue the hospital. This is not quality care or service excellence that they claim to have.  Helene Emmerich<//review>

Last March my husband took me to Placentia Linda Hospital for an emergency appendectomy. Dr. Cole was the surgeon on call that night. I arrived at 11:30 at night and there were only 2 other patients in the ER. I was diagnosed at 2am with acute appendicitis. The surgeon was called and he said he was on his way at 230am. I was given many drugs to keep me sedated until the doctor got to the hospital. Hours started going by and he never showed up. I and my husband asked the hospital to call the Dr. again. The nurse -Elizabeth- called Dr. Cole again he again said he was on his way. I was in horrific pain and begged the hospital to call another surgeon. They said they couldn't that Dr. Cole was the one on call. I was given more and more drugs to sedate the pain and the clock was just going by. 4am, 5am still nothing I felt as if I was being stabbed on a constant. They called him again at 6 he again said he was on his way. Still nothing 7am begging the hospital to help me and to call somebody else a nurse in the hospital explained to me that Dr. Cole likes his sleep. My husband was talking to everybody, they did nothing. 8am Dr. Cole was called again, he again said he was on his way. I cannot explain the pain the suffering the anguish. NOBODY deserves to suffer this way. 930 am Dr. Cole finally shows up I had surgery. Tired worn out and feeling no right I was released the next day. I had constant pain and fever for days. My husband made many calls to Dr. Cole explaining that something is wrong. Dr. Cole refused to see me and said it was gas. Dr. Cole instructed me to take an anti gas agent and I would feel better. I tried it I was getting worse, sicker and dizzy. We called Dr. Cole again and he literally argued with my husband saying I was overreacting. I had a fever and by the 5th day got Dr. Cole to agree to see me. I waited another two days for my appointment. Upon going to Dr. Coles office 7 days later after surgery, I was severely ill and could hardly walk. I went into the office and Dr. Cole reviewed my records from my surgery 7 days prior. He then said Well....Your appendix was compromised,(burst) and I think you have an infection. He never bothered until now to read the pathology report. I was immediately admitted into the hospital for an emergency surgery to clean out the infection and stayed 9 days. Still very ill the problem wasn't resolved. The damage done to my internal organs from the infection caused my gallbladder to have issues. 10 days later Im rushed back to the hospital, I was going septic and had another emergency surgery to remove my damaged gallbladder. Again I stayed in the hospital for 9 more days. 3 abdominal surgeries in 5 weeks. My poor body had really suffered. Dr. Cole said after all of this.. "your entire right side is covered in adhesions" You are at a really high risk for these adhesions to move and cause blockage with your intestinal tract. They move and wrap around organs, intestines. To this date a year later, I have constant pain, constant digestive issues. The explanation that I was given by Dr. Cole was because my appendix ruptured and the multiple surgeries to correct the damage. I WOULD HATE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ELSE, ALL BECAUSE THIS SURGEON WOULDN'T GET OUT OF BED. NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT OVER 9 HOURS FOR AN EMERGENCY SURGERY!</Text>

<Review>Oh. My. Gosh. Everything we ordered was incredible. Perfect pastry, delicious seasonings - absolutely delectable. The shop owner came out and chatted with us for several minutes - super nice guy. My husband and I ordered 14 items and definitely had leftovers. They’re reasonably priced for such high quality, and there’s a built-in discount when you order 12 or more. Please try them if you’re in the area - you definitely won’t be disappointed.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80844b86e54ba3c1:0xb0218773688ae440<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

All the empanadas are mouthwateringly spectacular!  You absolutely can't go wrong with any selection!  The owner is one of the nicest people in the biz.   He is always so nice and loving.  They even put a little flower that his kids pick on the box for my wife.  I find myself craving Vinoma at least once a week!  Steak & Cheese and buffalo chicken are my favorites!< /review>< gmapID>

My wife and I were pleasantly surprised at how amazing the food here is! The best part was the customer service, especially given the pandemic.

The empanadas are smaller than the pictures look, but good things must come in small packages because they were amazing.

The dough they use is the best I've ever had; definitely recommend this and will be coming back.< /review>

What a surprise.....  absolutely delicious menu items.  Ordered 4 dozen frozen  to take back to LA.  Very unique.... you'll be impressed. We had to eat outside because of Covid issues.< /review>

Owner is very nice and friendly, during this time you will order outside and someone brings your empanadas to your car. I love a classic beef and olive empanada with chimichurri on the side. They also have some vegetarian options like the artichoke and cheese empanda, one of my favorites.< /text>

<text>Love them ! Me encantaron !! I was skeptical about it...as an Argentine myself, I see many businesses selling “authentic” empanadas which they are usually not. I was driving by this town and saw the sign and had to stop to test them. Delicious ! They are the perfect size and packed with flavor. I tried both the traditional and the spicy beef and could not decide which one I like more. Thank you and great job !!<//text><user>104054140678551499737< /user>< Pics>

<Review>Ordered online for a pickup an hour later...arrived and the door was locked (would have been nice to have a note on the door saying such). The Tapas were very good, but a tad bit expensive. I would probably go back and use them for appetizers instead of a meal due to their size.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>So, so tasty! We we tried them all except the breakfast ones. They are all delicious. Our favorites are Buffalo chicken, traditional, and apple. And plum bacon. And really, all of them. Easy to order online. Super COVID-19 safe. You don't even enter to pick up - - they bring your well packaged order to the door. Super nice people--the owner is a delight! We've ordered a couple times now and they are very consistent. Highly recommend!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

So tasty, fresh and flaky perfect crust. The filling had delicious meat, olives, hard cooked eggs, sauce and plenty of it. Wow! Dare I say better than our Chilean empanadas! We will be back for more, so glad they arrived in Sonoma County.🌺🌸🌼< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great service. Cute little spot. Awesome soda!! Empanadas were good but nothing earth shattering. Want to go back and try the dessert ones. A little over $3 bucks (plus tax) for one very small empanada (literally two bites, maybe three) is pricey. We bought 12 and I could have easily ate them all myself. 40 bucks for basically higher quality fast food for one possibly two if you are not hungry. Definitely recommend you visit for yourself but their pricing is not going to work out long so hopefully they change their strategy. Nice to have something new in the area. Wish them luck.< /review>

If you are looking for real Argentinian empanadas this is the place to go.  Thank you for this amazing dinner! It was worthy the trip and I encouraged empanada lovers or Argentinian food to go and try them. In my point of view the best empanadas I've ever had in the United states.
Para los Argentinos y latinos amantes de las empanadas no duden en ir a probar éstas empanadas!! A mi criterio las mejores empanadas que he probado en los Estados Unidos. Sabor tradicional 100%< /Review>

The Tapas were very good, but a tad bit expensive.

This is a casual restaurant with fantastic food! The empanadas are really good, especially the spicy beef. The owner-chef is clearly passionate about his cooking, and the restaurant has a very friendly atmosphere.< /review>

<text>First time here, food was good. We ordered 11 baked empanadas and one frozen one,  and they called to make sure we wanted one frozen item (we did). Would definitely come again.</text>< name>

Delicious! Brian was very friendly in explaining the different flavors that they served. I got one of each of the meat empanadas. The crust as flaky as you bite into it and the flavors burst as you start to eat it. Loved it!< /review>

<name>BAIJC<//name><text>First and foremost, let me just say WoW!
This sweet little family owned eatery is one of a kind!!!
I was so hungry and I ordered a dozen a couple of each flavor.   If you're looking for a vegetarian option, they got you covered on a few different delicious choices♡
Brian the owner was so kind and so efficient.!
It's right next to InNOut.. so if you're looking for a quick double, Vinoma Tapas has got you covered. Only it comes wrapped in love and baked to perfection. You'll get your food faster and you'll also be supporting a local business that needs love at a time like this!

Support your local businesses!!! Eat good food, shop local always ♡
THANK you Vinoma<//text><gmap_id>0x80844b86e54ba3c1:0xb0218773688ae440<//gmap_id><UserId.>100604529068289873429<//UserId.><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

<text>Great service. Cute little spot. Awesome soda!! Empanadas were good but nothing earth shattering. Want to go back and try the dessert ones. A little over $3 bucks (plus tax) for one very small empanada (literally two bites, maybe three) is pricey. We bought 12 and I could have easily ate them all myself. 40 bucks for basically higher quality fast food for one possibly two if you are not hungry. Definitely recommend you visit for yourself but their pricing is not going to work out long so hopefully they change their strategy. Nice to have something new in the area. Wish them luck.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg7h0LAVVLMB-FaDQL_hqTmaHGMIIWLFd7YSyA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

My discovery of this gem was a happy accident. I got stopped by traffic turning into the In-N-Out and my wife spied Vinoma tucked in next to it. I stopped by and the chef met me at the door (no dine-in at this time due to pandemic) and told me all about the menu. It includes traditional closed empanadas and open-faced versions with a variety of toppings and flavors. There are also breakfast and dessert items. I tried some of almost everything (there is a lower unit price for a dozen+) and all of them were delicious. The plum & bacon was wonderful, ditto the al pastor. Meatless Caprese, creamy corn, and spinach artichoke varieties were also highly yummy. I've spent a good deal of time in Argentina and these are authentic. The natural sodas are tasty too. The chef was friendly and helpful and I will definitely be back.</text>

OMG!!!! Being an Argentinian and finding a place like this one has been a Godsent!!!! The empanadas are truly tasty and the service is great!!! I didn’t find the empanadas to be pricey at all knowing the amount of work it takes to prepare them and the good quality ingredients used.
We’ll keep coming back for sure!!!</Text>

It was worthy the trip and I encouraged empanada lovers or Argentinian food to go and try them. In my point of view the best empanadas I've ever had in the United states.
Para los Argentinos y latinos amantes de las empanadas no duden en ir a probar éstas empanadas!! A mi criterio las mejores empanadas que he probado en los Estados Unidos. Sabor tradicional 100%</review>< Pictures>

I lived in Buenos Aires but have not tasted empanadas autenticas in the U.S....until now!  Delicious, the real thing.  Also, nicest family who owns the business.  My wife and daughter loved their caprese & spinach artichoke empenadas.  They were impressed.< /text>

(Translated by Google) It is grilled at the same time as the order, so it’s so very delicious!!! I was going to take it home and eat it, but I ate one and it was delicious, so I ate it all on the spot. I will come again~!!!!

Great food, large helpings, and friendly staff, but the ambiance is the best part. The Cafe is part of the V-6 Ranch, so don't be surprised when you notice cowboys and cowgirls amble up to the bar. The cafe is a little remote, but when else will you get a chance to dine while sitting directly on the San Andreas Fault!<//text>

Fun cowboy restaurant with saddles for seating at the bar.  (Beer & Wine) Lots of branding irons hanging from the ceiling.  Their hamburgers are the best with buns made in a bakery in Atascadero.  The Shakin Burger was a must have.  Service was slow, but cheerful.</review>

You have to want to get here, but you'll be glad you made it. Food is great and genuine ( this is ranch country) and the wait help is super friendly. Beyond that is all the historical information and artifacts of ranching that adorn the walls. The most seismically active spot in all of California, this is a spot that captures many facets of California oak valley ranching history< /review>

<date>1566164307010</date><rating>4<//rating><Text>Nice cafe in the pretty little town of Parkfield, Ca. (pop 18). Best known for its proximity to the San Andreas fault (as you cross the bridge into town, there is sign that says, 'Now entering the North American Plate').
Along with  bbq, the cafe features excellent burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Hamburger, grilled cheese, plus glasses of local wine were $35  before tip.
There was a very strong country-western atmosphere, with a collection of branding irons and tack on the ceiling.
Service was prompt.</Text>< Pictures>

Love this place! Food is always, and I mean always fresh and delicious. The food is definitely worth the money.  You can literally taste the difference in their beef and feel healthy and full hours later. The Chicken Ortega burger is definitely worth a try as well as anything else on their menu</text>

I love the Parkfield Cafe. The food, setting and ambience are amazing. Plus, if you carry your ice chest you can even pick up some great grass fed beef to grill at home. 😊<//Review>

In my dozen plus dining experiences at the Parkfield Cafe they were extraordinary. No matter the choices from the menu, each and every item from a simple hamburger, divine salads, a steak to die for or ribs beyond compare makes the going well worth it.

Though as to service, it too is beyond compare.  The staff are locals, very friendly, helpful and see to every last detail to make every customer feel welcome and well cared for.

So forget those high prized jazzy places because Parkfield has it all and if you're lucky, you'll get a shake with your meal too!< /Review>

Not sure how you could find your way all the way out to Parkfield and not have a Parkfield Shakin' Burger!  Just thinking of it makes me hungry - I wish I was sitting out on the Cafe's porch on one of the saddle-covered stools with one of those right now!<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This spot has delicious burgers from the nearby V6 ranch. They're charbroiled and so very flavorful. The buns are from a local bakery and remind me of a soft ciabatta bread. The fries are crispy every time, too.

On this trip I needed a cup of coffee to help perk me up and found out they serve a nice cuppa Joe as well. I always look forward to stopping here. It's a popular spot for Moto travelers.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) (in Portuguese for Brazilians) Undoubtedly a place that was worth every minute ... My family and I were in February 2017. Brazilians looking for an unforgettable family trip. And it really was so! So much so that today my daughter remembered the place of the crooked house and the desire to return filled our minds. This is a post of longing and for Brazilian tourists to come to know. See you later...

(em português para brasileiros) Sem dúvidas um lugar que valeu cada minuto... Eu e minha família estivemos em fevereiro de 2017. Brasileiros em busca de uma viagem em família inesquecível. E realmente foi assim! Tanto que hoje minha filha lembrou do lugar da casinha torta e a vontade de voltar encheu nossas mentes. Este é um post de saudades e para que turistas brasileiros venham conhecer. Até breve...<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Great prices on tires. Used tires and new tires. Great place to go if you are really low on funds and need some good tire or tires for your car. Very helpful, very good workmanship, nice people to do business with.

Price is affordable but you get what you pay for. Came in this morning and got front tires replaced... the tires the guy put on were different sizes than what my car had on, and to top it all off he went and put on two different sizes... my steering wheel was shaky because they were uneven sizes...later at home I noticed one of the tires literally flat and when I started the vehicle I had a "low tire pressure" message on the other tire and a light on my dash. Came back and the guy's equipment malfunctioning and could not get the tire off, he messed up 2 of my screw caps and put on spare ones he found... the worst experience ever had to come in twice the same day. DO NOT COME HERE GUYS, PAY A LITTLE MORE BUT GET GOOD QUALITY TIRES AND YOU WILL SAVE TIME AND GAS TOO.< /text>

<time>1622906355050< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I wasn't expecting a great time, but it was disgusting. The pizza tasted like a frozen pizza from the grocery store, the food was cold, and in my drink after I drank half of it there was plastic container stuck in the bottom of the Stein. When I went up to the manager and told them what happened he said sorry things happen can I refund you or do you want another drink. It should not have happened that is dirty and with all the pandemic that is been going on it should have been caught. At the end of the night when we were leaving one of the crew members told us how they had been robbed at least four times in the past few months right before closing and there were just waiting for us to leave so it was a very very intense moment and I will never ever go again to the location in Santa Ana.</Text>< pictures>

<date>1601888266738<//date><pictures>None<//pictures><text>Of the pizza I have had in the city so far, Shakey's Pizza Parlor is easily one of the top in my list. (If only they delivered or were closer to me!) The deep dish is excellent, with a perfect crust, fresh sauce and great topping combinations. The thin crust is really tasty as well. I love the caprese salad as a perfect appetizer for one or two. They have a great selection of wines and beer. The atmosphere is casual, but classy and kind of fun. Service has been alternately really friendly and great, and bordering on rude and neglectful. Other than this, Little Star is an awesome pizza place.<//text>< rating>

After two previous visits to a different shakies I had completely given up on shakies all together but we decided to give it another try but at this location instead of the one closer to my house and its the best shakies food I've ever eaten. I dont know what they're doing at this one but its working the food was amazing and customer service excellent!<//review>

<review>I ordered a medium pizza and an 8-piece order of chicken for delivery for Super Bowl 55.

What I got was dried out bland pizza, over fried chicken (some pieces were like jerky), and a mound of thinly-sliced, disappointing mojos.

With DoorDashe’s delivery charge, the whole order came to nearly $60.00. I was very disappointed with the quality of the food, because I’ve always loved Shakey’s chicken.

Maybe the event was too overwhelming, but that doesn’t take away my feeling of being overcharged to be underwhelmed.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I was visiting from the Bay Area, and my friend recommended this spot. She was hyping it up, and saying its one of the best chicken sandwiches in Socal, so i decided to order the slider n tender combo medium and hot. It was really good, and the honey made the sandwich so much better. I would recommend just getting medium if you dont want to slightly sweat. The heat for the hot is good, and made me sweat a bit. Will definitely come back again</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

🍕 tasted great. Called in our order and was ready to pick up in 15min. The fried chicken never fails. No complaints, but the pizza slices could have been sliced/cut better. A few did stick, but my teeth took care of that.😁👍</Review>

The young lady with red hair and glasses, I unfortunately missed her name, she is an incredibly kind, great costumer service, The Best Representative and shows Great Leader Ship  ! I strongly believe she will make a great leader. The current " Boss " there is not so friendly or kind whats so ever. She deserves these Five Stars... not him. It's about what you'd expect. Pizza actually exceeded expectations, nice warm thin crispy crust and good overall taste and varied selection. Chicken was ok, spaghetti was a bit bland.  Decent price for buffet though. Less than $9 for lunch.</Text>

<review>Very good pizza, and the "Bunch o' Lunch" is still being offered after all these years.  It's a great place for family entertainment and a meal.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's kind of expensive.  I can get a large pizza at "the competition" for half of what a medium costs at Shakey's.</review><rate>4<//rate>< pictures>

<Review>It's about what you'd expect. Pizza actually exceeded expectations, nice warm thin crispy crust and good overall taste and varied selection. Chicken was ok, spaghetti was a bit bland.  Decent price for buffet though. Less than $9 for lunch.<//Review>< Pics>

Great service and very entertaining place. Food was not exactly the best, but it was pretty decent. The pizza sauce is not too good. There is great atmosphere and many types of games streamed throughout the whole restaurant.<//Text>

<Text>It was a perfect place to have a fun dinner with friends. The staff was really nice. I was able to reserve for 20 so easily. There was no pressure about ordering ahead of time. It was really nice. Food was delivered to our table sooner than anticipated. It worked out really well.<//Text>< Pics>

Their all-you-can-eat buffet is great! They have alot of different pizzas, fried & roasted chicken, both are great! Plus other entrees and sides and a nice salad bar. This is not a high end buffet but I like it. Their people are friendly and eager to help. They have 4 or 5 large tv's in the main dining area (if there is an event you want to see, all you have to do is ask...they have the Dodger channel), an area for reserved parties and a game room that the kids seem to love. All-in-all it's a great place to have a meal and take the load off, enjoy some good food and watch a game.<//text>

To start off we arrived closer to closing time, about 25 mins before... That being said the food was okay.... Not the best not the worst either. The pizza was lackluster but the chicken strips weren't too bad and neither were the potatoes. The place seemed clean. They seemed a little irritated that we showed up when we did... the guy taking our order wasn't very helpful, even though we said this was our first time there.<//Review>

Shakey's is a perennial favorite. I can't get enough of their golden fried chicken. Ok, it's a pizza place, but I love the chicken!<//Review>

<text>Go on a week night after 8pm and your good. Take a close look at the soda dispensers, they are coated with grime in areas on the outer spout. But food was good besides pizza crust tasting a little cardboardy. Seat had greasy hand prints and crumbs on table. Ticket worker was rude to kids and tried to rush them to pick candy instead of a toy.</text>< pictures>

Shakey's Pizza is always sooo delicious, always made fresh, chicken and mojo potatoes seasoned just right, we went to the location in Santa Ana on Fairview St, friendly staff ready to take your order, check it out, nice dining room or do take out, but great food for your money 😃</Text>

Lunch deals are good but have a big appetite to take advantage of the deal.  Standard buffet servings but limited.  Food was okay.  Several types of fresh pizza.</Text>

Not your average family pizza joint. This place has history, you can feel it almost as soon as you walk through the door. Not to mention the food is served very quickly. Would recommend.</Text>

<text>Absolutely love this place. It's always crowded with families and local sports teams coming by for pizza, chicken, and Mojos.

Speaking of, their weekend lunch buffet is fantastic. You can fix yourself a great plate. Salad, rice, Mojos, pizza and chicken.

Their family arcade can keep the kids occupied and screens for sports! No frills, just good food for a cheap family night<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcd892393bb3bf:0x2ffa22fa64331a81</gmap_id>< Pictures>

Man this place is expensive for tow large pizza and 3drink and a salad 100$ plus there super highly priced games this place is more expensive than Chuky Cheese food wise and games I feel like if this place is smart make everyone download the Shakey's app people can get coupons or discounts on top of the deductions of the high prices this place should bee completely full I mean bolth rooms and the only wey that could happen is when you guys stop taking advantage of all of the people that pay Shakey's owner bills oe expenses maybe we should get alot back after all this year's of living more then healthy MR or Ms Shakey's hope I can come back the staff is great costumer service< /text>

The most ridiculous shakeys ive ever been to. Most of their machines dont work and instead of focusing on that they rather not sell me a salad bar for 10 something for my husband because i got a pcm medium pizza deal . Never coming back had to down grade his meal just to salad . Lost money never heard of a buisness doing that before< /Text>

<text>If you want to hear crying and screaming from children whilst eating subpar pizza this is the spot for you! Pizza is subpar at best and the chicken is okay but nothing great. It's just a spot I visit probably once a year out of desperation after eating out at every other place.</text><gmap_id>0x80dcd892393bb3bf:0x2ffa22fa64331a81<//gmap_id>< time>

<text>In my opinion thid pizza really sucks lol,, i have never been a shakeys fan and im a pizza lover,,, pizza is salty, chicken is greasey, and mojos are dry with the taste of everything fried,, kids seem more intrested in the game room which does have a few of the newest games,, im sorry but this is my opinion and maybe your opinion is contrast to mine so im giving you the chance to be fair snd test this shakeys yourself then decide,,<//text>< userid>

<text>I got the salad bar...but walked out before I had my second serving. I saw 2 flies near the salad bar. The salad containers did not look regularly maintained-not very clean. I must have caught a bug after eating there because I had stomach cramps all night. I called the restaurant the following day. I told them that they need to take care of that salad bar more often & maybe use better enclosure for their food. The manager was very rude, he probably thought I wanted a refund of freebies, he didn't care about the unsanitary issue, he said he was absolutely sure there was no flies in his food, and I saw that with my own two eyes. It was expensive anyway.....Eat there @ YOUR OWN RISK!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcd892393bb3bf:0x2ffa22fa64331a81</Gmap_id>< pics>

<review>The food is delicious but the salad bar doesn't have many options. It doesn't look like they maintain the salad bar very clean. I've seen alot of flies on the ingredients. I don't really eat  much salad there so is ok. On the other hand the pizza, chicken, and mojos are delicious. Little expensive but totally worth it.<//review>< Response>

Nice place
Affordable price
Food was good 👌
The cups were kinda dirty but other than that it was a nice new experience
Been coming here for a while and I gotta say that the area where the cokes and straws are at it's really dirty , everything is a mess ,the plates ,forks etc dirty , the area where the mash potatoes are at it's dirty it's mix with different foods like it falls from a customer plate and they just leave it there they don't clean it up< /Review>

Man why is this placed looked down upon so much? I've had the most fun here with my brother since he was 6. Going into the arcade after eating like 10+ pounds of pizza is more fun than a week at Disney. Looking for a good time and a way to gain a few pounds? Shakeys got ur back :)<//Review>

I was invited to a party and the line was long and by the time it was my turn there was no pizza I had to go back to my place and wait for them to put back. Fortunately, my friend was well prepared and brought snacks and snacks for the meantime.
