I got my car back today and I can say I got it back looking better than it did at time of purchase. When I was looking for a place hands down the only place I'd go is City Collision Center. You walk in amazed by the awe of how nice the location is as well as their outstanding customer service. Veronica one of the nice front desk agents helped me get all set up and while I waited, offered a cold bottle of water. The place is luxurious for the customer and makes you think they definitely must give the cars this much detailed attention too. You can see the finished work is meticulous and everything is done on a timely manner. Anyone needing dent to accident repairs will receive the highest form of care here by far.</text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Bad experience.  Took about a month and a half to fix a bumper and hood, $8K in damages on my Tesla model X. When I finally got the call to pick up my car they said it passed their QC "quality control" I got to my car and the remote key fob was not working properly,  it would not open the doors! They said give us about an hour we will have it ready... 4 more days later they finally have it ready, they couldn't figure out the issue and had to take it to Tesla to get it working properly again. The communication is the worse part. Only reason I gave an extra star is because there is one girl there who actually is legit, the girl with the tattoos. Probably will not use this shop again in the future.< /Review>< Pictures>

I've toured this place long before I had my car in for service. I was impressed back then to say the least. I'm far more impressed now. I wish there was a way to rate above 5 stars! I was devastated when my Tesla got rear ended, but I knew who to call right away, City collision has been on top of everything every step of the way. The day after my accident I called as soon as I woke up. (Right about 10am) this was a Saturday morning, within 2 hours they had picked my car up from the overnight impound and moved it their lot. Veronica has been super helpful with answering any questions I've had, weather its something she knew off hand or something she had to call me back on she has been on point! I have horrible anxiety issues and I am so happy to have our Model 3 in the hands of a company that makes me feel confident that I don't have to worry. This place is an absolute GEM of a repair center. I can't wait to get my car back. But until then I know she is in good hands! Thank you so much City Collision!<//text>

I couldn't be more satisfied  with their quality work, not to mention their overalll level of service. Last but not least, their operational layout is well organized; which it didn't surprise me to realize that city collision center is justifiably endorsed by highly profiled and successful car makers like Tesla, Nissan, Ford, Chevy and few more.. As well as most major insurance companies...
I wholeheartedly recommend City Collision Center to whoever wants their car revisited body and paint.<//Text>< Pics>

I had come into City Collision Center to get some work done on a rear collision I had happen a couple months ago. I had been postponing it as it was only minor to me and my fault backing into a pole. I spoke with Gary and he offered me a great price compared to a couple others around and the results were great.</review>

Excellent Service, do not look anywhere else! Thank you Eric for taking care of State Farm for me they weren't easy, and wouldn't budge. My claim got denied twice and State Farm didn't want to pay additional money for my finder. Eric made me feel at ease, and took care of my car and the insurance.. I recommend this place to everyone! I can't wait to pick up my car.</Review>

Second, my car turned out like new! I had been in a fender bender with a parking garage (the garage won), and was told the entire door would have to be stripped, fixed, and re-painted. I simply can't tell where the new paint is, and my car is a tough light blue/silver to match.

The last car shop I ended up at took 3 weeks + to finish my car, and kept pushing the time further out. At City Collision Center, I was given an estimate and the car was finished right on schedule in just a few days.

As with any car repair, there can be some unexpected issues or extra battling with insurance, but the difference is extremely apparent at Karry's. They went above and beyond to make things right, and Gary truly had only the best of intentions.

Everyone here really cares, and I've never felt so comfortable handing over my keys before. While I hope to not go back any time soon, I know exactly where I would go again to give my car the greatest treatment. Thanks again, everyone! :)<//text><pics>None</pics>< gmap_id>

After a chain of emails with Veronica their receptionist I finally get the green light to pick up my truck. I go in and it turns out that the truck is still missing 2 parts. I wait another month and then I am told that my truck is ready. I call Friday evening letting them know that I am on my way to pick up my truck and will be arriving shortly. I arrive a littler after 7:30pm. When I arrive all the lights are off, please keep in mind that their hours of operation on Fridays are from 8am-8pm so I had arrived 30min before closing and yet they had decided to close early. I waited around and then an employee opened the gate I told him I was there to pick up my truck he made a call and told me to sit tight for about 10min that the owner was on his way to give me my truck. By 8:30pm I had decided to give up. I wrote Veronica an email and I did not get a response until the following week. They agreed to drop of my truck at my home since I don't have time to be playing games. I was working when they dropped off my truck, once I got home I realized that they had stripped the paint off of my tailgate and didn't bother repainting it. In other words my truck came back from the body shop in worse condition than when I took it in. Again I emailed veronica and she told me to bring it in. I asked how they were going to remedy the situation before I continued wasting my time. They never replied. Worst business experience I have ever had, complete incompetence on every level of this business, from the owner, to shop workers, to estimators, to the receptionist. Do yourself a favor and just take your business elsewhere.<//Review>< rating>

<Text>Was driving down to Anaheim to spend 2 weeks with my friend. Had another driver hit my driver door whilst on the highway - I was pissed. Since I had the time, I dropped my car off at City Collision. Took a few days to get the part - expected - but they did a wonderful job replacing and paint matching the door before I drove back home. Cool interior, great service, nice people.<//Text>< pics>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>I got into an accident 3 months ago after I had someone rear end me. I took my car into the shop and 3 days later it was repaired. It looks exactly how it did when I first bought it! These guys are great and I would recommend them to anyone looking to get their car repaired quick and painlessly.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had my front bumpers replaced here and they did an awesome job. I was planning on bringing it to my usually auto shop but decided to do this one since I was going to be in the area on that day. They did an excellent job and the staff was able to accommodate for me in such a short notice. The waiting area was pretty nice too!<//Text>

My new Audi was literally wrecked after a car ran a stop sign and couldn’t break fast enough to prevent slamming into my front passenger door. I took my car over to see Victor and he gave me a great estimate which I sent back to my insurance. The work was fast and flawlessly done. You can’t even tell it was in an accident. Call my man Victor he will hook you up.< /Text>

This place is one of the best body shops I've been to, the staff are great and Veronica was so helpful she kept me updated on all my  repairs and great communication skills. Eric is such a great person and helpful also.. I was very satisfied with the work they did on my Tesla D100 wouldn't trust anybody else with it thank you guys so much and thanks again Veronica and the team you guys are superior :-)< /Text>

<Text>Gary and his crew were so good! I got into a car accident in my Corolla a while back and they did an amazing job fixing up my door. It looked like new.

I recently got a new car and came back for a full car detail. Gary personally came to say hi to me and give me the pricing details.  Amazing service and excellent job!

Side note, I loved the super cars in their garage and ritzy waiting area.<//Text>< pictures>

I'm from the midwest and was in sticker shock at car repair prices in LA, but a coworker recommended this place and I'm glad I listened. Great service, nice employees... they gave my car back to me looking better than I brought her in! Thanks, guys. True Hollywood treatment!<//review>

Rating F.... Bad business practices and extremely unprofessional.. Do not bring your car here. Overpriced ripoff the cost of parts are over MSRP.. This company is dishonest and the workmanship is poor. The BBB also has an F rating and dosen't give City Collision an accreditation.< /Text>

Victor and Gary both helped make an unpleasant situation much better. I bumped into a car in a parking lot, damaging my front end. After a couple of quotes had me wondering if I should even get the repairs or not, I came into City Collision expecting more of the same. But I was wrong, I had a quote much less than the competition, and the work was done quickly and efficiently. I would definitely recommend skipping the headache of other shops and heading straight to City Collision next time you need body work.<//text>

<Text>This place is so bougie and so nice! Right when i walked in, they asked how can they help me and then offered me water real quick. I'm digging the service so far! I recently got a new Lexus but someone keyed my passenger side's door already! I was pretty upset by this but i read the reviews at CCC so decided to check them out. They fixed my door within 3 days, and it looks just like new. The paint job was amazing and i am a happy driver again! Def would come back again, especially since the place and the staff are incredibly nice!<//Text>< pictures>

<review>It's a beautiful place and they promise the world. That's as far as it goes... just promises. In reality, I've never seen so much incompetence, delays and excuses .
First they told me I had to leave my car there to get an estimate which has never happened in 40 years of driving. State farm needed an additional estimate. and said" just send it'll be approved ". City said they would send it the next day. Two days later I call ...it has not been done. I got a bad feeling. they've already broken their first promise .I nagged them into doing it that day .They got approval two days later so by Friday they could have started the work. They didn't hurry. They waited till Monday even though they were open Friday  late and open Saturday.
They subcontract work out. You don't know who's doing your work nor the quality of it. When City got my bumper back.. it was not done correctly so it was sent back .So I lost another week.  How good could a subcontractor be if it had to be done twice ? the cheaper the sub.. the more money City makes .
The owner Victor told me he would follow it and expedite it. He never got on the phone again with me. When I would ask specific questions, the most common answer I got from Julian who actually mishandled the repair was "I don't know". Then City had to Paint it Twice  because the first color didn't match . This is supposed to be a high-end Collision Center ??? Even trying to pick up my car when it was supposedly ready. I had to call 3 times and it wasn't ready the day they said.
They had my car 15 Business days for two Bumper repairs basically minor  work. I'm sure they will respond and they will spin it but I have to tell you the only thing they're really good at is deception ,excuses and explanations that make no sense. The only reason I found these things out is because I asked a lot of questions . They were not forthcoming  with info. Be warned.<//review><response>None</response><Rating>1< /Rating>< username>

< Review>
I got into an accident and the front of my Prius was done!
I found City Collision and I talked to Veronica, she was so friendly and helpful. The lobby is very clean and warming. The couches are comfortable and they have a tv and fireplace going while you wait. My car was towed to City Collision and they got me in right away. When I got my car back a couple days later it looked better than before I got into the accident. If anything ever happens to my car I’m coming back here.< /Review>

First class customer service like a concierge-- they did a breakdown, haggled with usaa insurance, arranged my rent a car, and a dozen other little things. I reclined in their lounge. They brought me bottled water and updates. Treat yourself if you got the coin. These folks di it right.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

This is the shop of shops that anyone that's in goes to for any high end detailed autobody work. I had a lil bumper car action on the 405, well I didn't see it possible to get my COBRA back to tip top new quality. But not only did they fixed the damage, the precision details they did made my COBRA even more nastalgic then it was when Mr. Shelby sighned it over to me. So wanna look good and fit in with the in crowed? Then look no further, City Collision Center is the best in town.< /Text>

<name>Anmar Kamoona<//name><Review>These people are scandal af they're bunch of liars
Erick is a freaking sneak
My case been open since October of 2016 and there's still parts of my car that haven't been fixed and they cashed the money out and took it without fixing my car
Every time I go there Erick blames State Farm and tells me that it's their fault
I would never ever go there or recommend anyone to go there
It took 2 months to get my car out of the shop and they messed up my cruise control, paddle shifters, and my airbag light was on after I took the car from them

Just wondering if they changed owners in 2021 or they changed their recipe for the garlic, and lemon pepper wings? Not the same, the seasonings/flavors just weren't present this time around, : ( very disappointed, use to go all the time, even before it was Padak and it was "Love Letters".  Wings were bland. Not giving up though, will try again.< /review>

Came across this when googling Korean fried chicken places, and decided to give it a go.
Ordered the combo #1 and an order of Korean kimchi tacos.
The combo was hands down the winner. They give you the entire bird, your choice of flavoring, medium sweet potato pizza , and 2 liter soda of choice.
It wasn’t as crunchy as other Korean fried chicken that I’ve had, but the flavor and juiciness  of the chicken made up for that. That and the freshness of the chicken too. The sweet garlic sauce won over the soy sauce option in my opinion.
The sweet potato pizza was surprisingly good. I’ve never agreed with pineapple on pizza, but it worked well with the rest of the ingredients. The pizza bread was dense and soft, but not the type that leaves you in a bloated food coma like other pizza doughs.
The kimchi tacos where pretty disappointing, the tortillas weren’t toasted or warmed, and the added salsa and sour cream didn’t mesh well with the bulgogi and kimchi. I honestly didn’t even taste the kimchi in there.
Aside from the taco that was a huge disappointment, I’m going to go back to try other flavors that caught my eye.<//text>

Def upped their game. And still one of the cheaper wings around, although as they have seen, customers are willing to pay more for better quality. Think I'm gonna order some right now itS making.mw hungry !< /Text>

< Review>
This is our first time here.  I came out for a nice lunch with my fiancée and sat out on the balcony.  They were doing some measurements for renovations and needed measurements underneath our table.  I had no problems moving to allow for it and the owner was kind enough to let us try their desserts on the house for that.  I'm really glad to have tried it.  He has us try a modified setup of the tiramisu with red berry sauce on top.  It tasted like marshmallows with the coffee and berry taste.  You should get it.<//Review>

Very interesting wing options, the chilly ones are my favorite. Love the waffle fries too! Service has always been really nice. Deducting one star cause the food is a bit too greasy for my taste.< /review>

Having been to the ice cream shop next door, we saw Pa-Dak and were curious. When we walked in, service was prompt and friendly, but the place was a tad messy, as if they had just experienced a big rush.

We didn't know what to expect from the chicken (which is the reason we came), but I suppose I was expecting something a bit unusual. Most of the other Korean cuisine I've tried has a distinct flavor profile, and maybe I was hoping for some distinctiveness in the fried chicken.

Well, it's fried chicken. It was hot, crisp, and good; but not distinctive. The batter is somewhat crunchier than our typical fried fare; which was interesting, but again, not distinctive.

I can't comment on the other dishes, but they get good reviews here, so perhaps I'll try again.</review>

We always order the Happy Combo #4 and its enough food for 2-4 people. You receive a medium margherita pizza, Korean fried wings, and a 2-liter drink. You can choose 2 flavors for the wings. My favorite is the sweet chili. I thought it was going to be super spicy but it’s mild with a good flavor. The pizza is very tasty and cheesy. Overall, the service is great, food is delicious, and the place is clean.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I have recently started going to this place and I LOVE their pa-dak chicken. It is definitely one of my favorite places to go to for that popcorn style type chicken. Their pickled radishes are the best pickled radishes I've ever had. Since they are open late too I will be coming more often at night.< /Text>

The crust is amazing and it's filling . The small pizza has four slices and contains three types of meat the bugogi was delicious. Tried some waffle fries and my least favorite was the popcorn chicken because it was mostly dark meat so the chicken pieces did not look appealing. The pricing was reasonable and ALOT of customers order to go.<//Text><user_id>114918780050714364259</user_id><GmapID>0x80dd2d049ddc97ab:0x9b17451e6cbb14d</GmapID>< resp>

<Text>Solid late night spot!

The PaDak Korean chicken is crisp and the slightly tangy sauce makes it oh so delicious.

I got it in the #1 combo with the golden medallion pizza. The gold medal pizza has the stuffed crust and it's pretty addicting.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The wait was short and the atmosphere was just what we were looking for with my girlfriend coming off work - casual and comfortable. Got the sweet garlic popcorn pa-dak, corn cheese, and spicy chicken cheese, all fantastic. Pa-dak was crispy, sweet, and savory (would get wings next time, we were just lazy). Corn cheese was on point and even had a little pineapple. Spicy chicken cheese was a new venture for us and was delightful - extra savory, not too spicy but packed with flavor. With a pitcher of beer the bill barely came out over $40 - definitely plenty of bang for your buck. This place is perfect for when you want to grub on some perfectly executed comfort food. Can't wait until our next trip!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>It's small but service and food are good!!! Love their beer and their fried chicken wings!!! All flavors are sooo good - crispy fried and sweet garlic are my family's go-to here! Their cubed pickled radish is yum!! Their pizzas are good too! Love their crust - it's more fluffier than crispy. All in all - YASSS PLEASE!

One star off because the wait is a bit long. If you are like to drink and chat with friends & family & don’t mind the long wait...the food is GOOD. The potato pizza is surprisingly good. The Happy Combos are reasonably priced. The wings are delicious.

I have to warn you though. They serve you a plate of coleslaw with corn. Don’t eat it! Wait until your food comes. I was just snacking and snacking & the waiter brought us another plate. Soon I was too full from the coleslaw that I barely managed to eat a few of the wings & a slice of pizza. If I had known, I would have held off on eating the coleslaw. That’s just diabolical!

Parking is free but the lot fills up pretty fast. The bathrooms are decent. The servers are friendly. There’s not that many tables/booth so time your visit well or you might have a very long wait (cuz a lot of people showed up after us). Informal dining so you don’t have to dress up all fancy.

There’s a cafe nearby & ice cream shop if you still have room for dessert afterwards.</review>

< review>
This is the best, crispy KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) in the area.  Get the sweet spicy sauce on the side to preserve crispiness.  The side of pickled radish cuts the richness a bit. Pizza is interesting but only ok.

Service is very slow when they are short-handed so generally we do takeout.  You don't get the complementary slaw which is pretty good though.<//review>

Flying chicken or pa dal is great place to go if you want good fried chicken or chicken wings.  I say it is much better than your average American fried chicken or wing. Dduk bok kind is great too.   Also 2000cc sapporo draft is something you gotta have.</Text>

<Review>Attack of the Flying Chicken Pa-Dak!!

When I say corn, you say cheese!  Corn!  Cheese!  Corn!  Cheese!

When I say foul, you say fart!  Foul!  Fart!  Foul!  Fart!

Flatulence is a small price to pay, for when corn cheese tantalizes the tastebuds.

Flying Chicken Pa-Dak, formerly Pizza & Chicken Love Letter, is a casual Korean restaurant serving pizza, chicken, chicken wings, popcorn chicken & small bites, along with beer (draft & bottled) & soju.  Beer towers, too!  Gracing my sexy presence by walking in, I already knew I wanted the corn cheese.

Complimentary salad greeted me as I waited for my order to be up.
A large heaping helping of shredded cabbage, corn & dressing, the salad was crisp, light & a great way to stay regular.  Considering the amount and it's complimentary, it was great!

Corn cheese ($5.99)
Corn, cheese & a few pineapple chunks.  Simple, yet effective.  Melted gooey, fatty, unctuous cheese was incredibly delectable.  Corn niblets, a lot of them, provided the sweetness & the brightness came from the pineapple chunks.  I normally prefer pineapple fresh by itself, but I'm glad Flying Chicken Pa-Dak didn't go overboard with it, as the pina went well with the dish.  Anymore, and I probably wouldn't have liked it.  One caveat - the aluminum foil helps with cleanup, but I found as I tried to scrape every last bit of burnt cheese, it started to rip apart.  So, unless you want a little more metal in your diet, be careful of bits of foil in your spoon.  Great dish!

Flying Chicken Pa-Dak's menu includes common pizza, such as BBQ chicken & Margherita, along with fusion creations like bulgogi & sweet potato.  I'm a fan of Korean wings, and Flying Chicken Pa-Dak has wings in various ways - sweet garlic chicken, for example.  Their namesake, Pa-Dak, is chicken topped with green onions.

Service was good.  The wait wasn't very long & the attendant checked on me while having my lunch.  A fair amount of booth & table seating, with 2 flatscreen TV's & Korean pop on the speakers for entertainment.

Parking is in a private lot, shared by Café Maji & the soon to be open Bruster's Real Ice Cream.

You have Pa-Dak to be kidding me!  You definitely have to check out Flying Chicken Pa-Dak, if you haven't already.  Have a slice of fusion pizza, some delicious Korean wings & a tipple or two of Sapporo or soju.  And, of course, don't forget about that corn cheese!  Just make sure to stay downwind of me after having it ;p

Highly recommend!

(Translated by Google) Order pizzas with sweet potatoes Delicious As for fried chicken at But only slightly tasteless As for the cabbage salad Salad dressing is quite agile.

Good four star service Because he brought fried chicken But without sauce Must request more This shop is busy all along with a lot of customers. Overall Clean restaurant If eating an Asian flavor pizza Therefore recommend this shop

(Original)
สั่งพิชซ่าหน้ามันฝรั่งหวาน รสชาติอร่อยดี ส่วนไก่ทอดกรอบได้ที่ แต่อย่างเดียวรสชาติจืดไปหน่อย ส่วนสลัดกระหล่ำปลีนั้น น้ำสลัดค่อนข้างเปรียว

การบริการดีระดับสี่ดาว เพราะเอาไก่ทอดมาให้ แต่ไม่มีน้ำจิ้ม ต้องได้ขอเพิ่มเติม ร้านนี้ยุ่งตลอดลูกค้าเยอะ โดยส่วนรวมแล้ว ร้านอาหารสะอาด ถ้าจะทานพิชซ่ารสชาติเอเชีย จึงขอแนะนำร้านนี้<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The pizza and the chicken are delicious. Sweet potato pizza seems to be Korean style and Supreme combination pizza is similar to costco pizza but thinner than similar. The texture of the authentic Italian pizza is also felt. All delicious.

(Original)
피자, 파닭 다 맛있네요. 고구마 피자는 한국 스타일인 것 같고 슈프림 콤비네이션 피자는 맛이 코스트코 피자와 비슷한데 보다 더 얇습니다. 따라서 정통이태리식 피자의 식감도 느껴집니다. 모두 맛있음.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The chicken is really fragile so if you don't really season it If you don't want to sprinkle it or just fry it, you can buy it separately. Returning doctor 100per. Good because none is irritating

닭이 염지가 진짜 약하게 되어있어서 정말 양념만 안시키면 하나도 안짬!! 그냥 양념 안뿌리고 달라고 하시던가 그냥 후라이드 시키시면 양념은 따로 사세요.  재방문의사 100퍼. 하나도 자극적이지 않아서 좋음<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Is it me or does their large pizza look huge?! Any way, I ordered a half pepperoni and half cheese for my kids and a vegan for me. I loved it and so did my kids. Owner (I assume) is very nice. I had left overs the next day, so what I did is I heated up 2 slices in the microwave for about 40 seconds, then I put the slices on a griddle to toast the bottom for about 10 minutes and omg!

<text>We eat here on the regular and rarely have complaints. Today we had a toppping mishap that sent my preschooler into a melt down. They had a 2nd pizza made and delivered asap. They handled the issue so fast and were really caring about making it right with us. Just another reason we love ordering from them. The food is top notch and the prices are way lower than other places nearby.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Pizza cool, but they stop delivering super early. Called at 650 and they were done. Smh. Choosing a place that has better delivery hours.< /review>

<review>We've ordered 4 times in the last 4 months the pizza is soooooooo yummy! The first time I ordered there two different sizes thinking it was a large and a medium. There are four of us we had pizza for a couple days. The last time we ordered the man remembered my husband and asked him where have you been I haven't seen you. I guess he wasn't working a few days we ordered. I think that's great customer service. I recommend Papa Nino's Pizza!<//review>< Pics>

You HAVE to order from here, their ingredients are so fresh! Best pizza in Manteca and their vegan pizza is amazing, indistinguishable from regular pizza! I've tried I haven't had pizza this good since I left the east coast.</Review>

<Text>I have never been to their shop but I've eaten their pizza leftover after  two days. It was excellent! I can't imagine what its like when its hot and fresh. The only thing I can find wrong with their business is that they don't charge enough for their pizza. I wish I lived in Manteca. I'd be eating there twice a week.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>I've been to a lot of pizza shops before but I have to say this place is one of the best. Great food and the owner made us feel like I've been there 100 times. We drove all the way from Turlock to eat at papa nino's and I'm going to do it again. Thank you Papa nino's.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>No complaints here! From the time we ordered till the moment we walked out. This was an amazing place! So nice clean.

The pizza! I love that it's not greasy. It's perfect! And the crust easily broke off. As if the bread melted in your mouth. We ordered the pizza jalapeño , pepperoni and pineapple. SOOOOO GOOD!

Than we got the Nutella pizza with strawberries. It's literally ! So good! This would most likely be our spot on Tuesdays</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x8090151f85f60c0f:0x76dfb2dcfc973742<//GmapID></record>

Ordered a large pep mush saus pizza and a chicken garlic. The pizzas looked very good,  not too thick in crust which was refreshing. My only gripe is that the sauce needs a bit more tang or pop to it. Overall very good.  I can see what the hype is about considering how the other pizza joints are here in manteca.< /text>< pics>

Is a nice clinic, the personnel is nice and polite. The other thing they have is early appointments, I like it because there is no too much traffic and  you get in and out faster. You have the ability to check in online or by phone so you also save time in this manner. Over all I recommend it.< /Review>

Dermatologist PA Roger Bellamy is extremely knowledgeable, proficient and personable.   He had so much patience in listening to our concerns regarding the many skin cancers my husband has had.  He explained in great detail how to deal with these situations and what we should look for.  The staff at the office was very polite and efficient. We highly recommend PA Bellamy and West Dermatolgy.< /Review>

I pre registered using the on line application so upon arrival the check in process was pretty quick.  Had PA Roger take a look at a spot on my nose since it resembles a possible skin cancer concern.  Roger took a sample for a biopsy, patched me up and I was out of there quickly.  Friendly staff, efficient operation. Now all I have to do is wait a few days for the test results.</review>

Very nice and pleasant “chair side manner!” Explained cause of issue, stressed the importance of a “good sunscreen outside at all times” and gave me choices as to what my “plan of care” could consist of. Very happy and impressed with this provider! Will recommend, highly! And as always, office/ancillary staff wonderful, as usual! I like to see the same faces there every time I return!🙂</Review><Name>Bruno From HB< /Name>< rating>

<Review>I had rosacea breakout for about a year which i was not aware i had, and went to a dermatologist who made me spend so much money. Until i was referred to west dermatology. Dr. S. Mohale cleared my face beautifully. In only 2 months my life was back to normal, From day one they have given me excellent customer service and cared about my issues. I usually don't like to public any coments but i am sooo happy with west dermatology. Thank you dr Mohale and all the staff from west dermatology in redlands.</Review>< Pics>

Dr. Sharon is amazing and has helped me so much where other dermatologist were mistreating my condition.
My only issue is long wait times. Otherwise everyone is pleasant and I am now faithfully a patient of Dr. Sharon</Review>

The staff is very polite, and sweet. The office is extremely clean. Dealing with the doctor is a refreshing and wonderful delight . I would recommend this doctor to anyone who has any type of  affliction with skin. This  doctors office is a dream come true for patients with any type of problems with the skin. I felt open to speak to the doctor about anything and he was excepting of all my afflictions. If I could give this doctor more than five stars he would receive all the stars in the sky. I love this doctor amazing and the staff as wonderful as he is.</text>

I live about 45 miles away but wouldn't go anywhere else. The whole organization is professional and very well run! They don't overbook and alert you to your appointment several times prior so no way you will forget and miss an appointment. Dr Shiell is friendly and pleasant but doesn't mess around with a lot of chit chat but rather takes care of business and shakes hand and moves on! I appreciate that and so should every patient because means they don't sit around waiting. He projects his knowledge by his quick evaluations which have never been wrong! He is skillful in his work. Not much more I can say about the organization or the Dr! Their professionalism speak for themselves?</review>< user_name>

<review>I met Dr. Shiell for the first time.   I really liked him.   Excellent bed side manners,  easy to talk too, a great listener, and answered all my questions.  Made me very comfortable through a very stressful ordeal.  The staff were all great  and also demonstrated the same traits as the Doctor.   Providing services on Saturday once a month was well received by patients.  Overall, an outstanding experience.  Thanks to all! Don< /review>< Rating>

As usual, my experience at West Dermatology was excellent. The entire staff  is pleasant and professional.  Dr Shiell always makes even the unpleasant procedures bearable because of his bedside manor. He explains everything he is going to do and why.  I enjoy my experience every time I come. The stAff always makes a follow up call as necessary and promptly.<//Review>

<text>While Roger was very quick, I felt I was given very little instruction about the care of my face and the two moles that were frozen.  BTW they are still on my face as I’m not sure they are doing what they are suppose to do. Also he was in quite a hurry to exit and it was a struggle to ask him questions.  The prescriptions I was given were quite costly. Approximately $180 each.  I haven’t filled them yet and may cancel my next appt.<//text>< pics>

I was early but waited until at least 30 minutes past my appointment time before I was even acknowledged by the staff up front. In short, I was forgotten about, skipped for reasons unbeknownst to me or you were really backed up but failed to communicate with the customer. Not a great experience while I waited.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I initially came to West dermatology with an infected cyst that had not let me sleep for multiple days. After waiting a week, I was greeted by Sharon who was the PA on call. She indicated that she could not do anything for me except prescribe an antibiotic. I indicated I would probably have to go to an ER given the severity of the pain and the fact I couldn’t sleep to which she responded that we had to wait for the antibiotic to take hold.

She indicated that if it was not better to call back which I did after two days after which time it was much worse. Dr. Shiell then Saw me at a moments notice and provided treatment which relieved the swelling and subsequently the pain as well as change the antibiotic.

Upon return to have packing removed, PA Sharon seemed more concerned in making sure that the doctor had confirmed her diagnosis than in treating my wound.
The staff at West dermatology was first rate and the facilities are great as well. Dr. Shiell was better than good, he was very attentive, and followed through with good practice and professionalism. I believe Western Dermatology would benefit by replacing PA Sharon with someone who is a bit more professional and capable.
However, I would give West Dermatology 5 stars with the omission. Of the treatment by the PA.<//Review>

I was seen right away and was treated with courtesy. All my questions were answered. I was also given a prescription for something I’ve been struggling with for awhile. I didn’t need to do anything everything was taken care of through the office.</text>

Staff was nice. Dr asked me several times if there was anything of concern. He listened. He was fast at the procedures of removing troublesome spots. Only thing was appts were running a little late, which I would like to know up front.<//Review>

I have met the best dr. He off course very knowledgeable and very caring.
But I have one suggestion, when he order his staff to give this patient some samples, make sure they should check the expiration date on'm. Thank you for good services.<//Review>

<review>I have been seeing Dr. Shiell for over a year. I've been to many dermatologists, however Dr Sheill is the only one that really takes the time to listen and understand my problem. He is booked full, so the appointments are short, but I never leave feelng that I was rushed. He seems to genuinely care. I highly recommend.< /review></record>

The receptionists are rude and lazy and let you know when they feel irritated through the way they respond to questions with there tones and demeanor. Very unprofessional in my opinion.

They actually argue with you at times.

I most likely will not be going back to this office again and switching to another office anywhere available.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Luis Velasquez<//user_name><text>This doctor sliced a piece of daughter's skin to see what going on with her condition. After so much cleaning and healing, they never called us back to tell us any result. Shady practices??? idk NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. Plus, going into the doctord office the nurses acted very professional, id expect them to be the ones be the doctor. But when the actual doctor comes I feel like im being eximaned by the legally blonde girl coming back from starbucks. never again..<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x80db560daa664403:0x591bb05ffef3adbd< /GmapID></record>

I am so sad to say, I  will never shop here again over 3 wet bales of hay,  instead of just believing what a good customer was saying.  went on a camera that they have as people drive through,   said the bed of our truck was dry, and so was they hay.  It was stacked in our hay shed as soon as my husband got home, It had not rained for way over a week,  so when I opened one bale, it was wet all over the top of the bale, and had seeped into the hay, something you cannot feed horses.  I called and told them and one of the women gave me a credit for that bale and asked if there was anymore, which I had not checked,  so later found 2  more bales and not sure of the ones stacked on.  We were expected to drive back with the three bales if we wanted our money back.  there goes the gas, not to mention my poor husband of 65 would of had to lift up the bales into the truck, which is alot different then dropping them from a truck.  Anyway they lost a good  customer over three bales, because  they would not believe me, or just let me fax pictures.  It is quite a drive for us.  So Last batch was dusty and half looked like end bales, instead of the beautiful kentucky blue grass, which is 21 dollars a bale, so you expect the best.  and this batch, so far 3 wet bales.   Again lost a loyal customer, over three bales of hay</review>

Due to a minor defect, I received a discount. This was without me saying a single word. I recommend this place to everybody.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Good people, good selection, if you are from Oakdale you know it is a family owned business, they have a good selection of pet and farm supplies and a nice selection for clothing, the people working there are friendly and helpful.</text>

<text>Horrible customer service! I was trying to purchase boots, and two young ladys behind the counter, even when asked for help, were not interested in selling me anything! No one asked me what I was looking for at all. After I walked back to the boots trying to figure out what they had instock in my size, I gave up and left. I've purchased 200 dollar hats, feed, and boots here before, and customer service was never this bad! I'm on my way to boot barn right now and it's sad. I wasnt offended, I was very disappointed! I'd rather support local business, but being ignored like that, what other choice do I have.<//text>< rating>

I came in looking for dog and cat food. One of the ladies came up to me asking if im finding everything ok. I told her what i was looking for and she was very help full. She told me about a deal to save and gave me some samples for both cat and dog food. She was very nice and very helpfull.</review>

The warehouse/loading guys are always quick and friendly. When we, or our customers, had supplies delivered to our ranch (before they raised their delivery fees) their delivery guy (I believe 'Dan' but could be wrong) he was extremely nice and helpful.
Uodate 6-17-20: We haven't conducted business here in awhile and they once again confirm why. I purchssed over $125 of items and upon given the receipt the clerk says nothing. I tell het thank you and she impatient replies, "Uh-huh".  Just rude. They really don't want business even cost more than nearby feed carriers. Do your business some where else where they WANT your business.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Gmap_id>0x80eeab197808f599:0x942f8c8ac6580974<//Gmap_id><Review>This store embodies how I want to raise my child. Full of wonder, full of awareness, and full of kindness towards the world. When you enter the store, you feel like a kid again. There are unique, colorful, informative, silly, and just plain fun toys, books, decorations, gifts, etc. I wish I lived closer! I have already made many online purchases until the next time I can go in person. And I love the way they decorate their packages!</Review>< rating>

Such a wonderful store for kids toys, books, and more! Love the message of this place to promote equality and inclusivity. A safe place for everyone. We were helped by the kindest man. Really happy we stumbled into this store and bought some fun toys and unique books for our nephew!< /review>

This is our go to shop when we have our grandchildren with us. They love going to the “rainbow” store. The book selection is the shining star of this shop. The staff is always friendly and so very helpful when you have a four year old who insists on looking at each and each single thing before picking an item. We are so very lucky to live close by and visit often.</review>

<text>This cute little toy shop caught my 2.5 year old’s eye and we went in. It has such an array of toys that I can’t find anywhere. You can tell they put a lot of thought into the items they sell. I encourage you to take your little one in there because they’re going to love it! Both my daughter and I wanted everything in it! Or if you’re too far- their website is great for online orders! Support small businesses if you can.</text>< pictures>

I am from the Central Coast area of California, so to me this is still shopping local. I love supporting small business people - and this is one that that is awaking the inner child in me! I love the retro feeling of all the toys, but yet the newness of inclusiveness and awareness. I tell people I shop here for my grandkids, but it is really for me!</Text><username>Sheri Humphries<//username>< Date>

Onederchild is an absolutely magical little toy store! I go to get gifts for all of my nieces and nephews as well as whenever I need a gift for any child (or anyone who's a child at heart). You can tell that they really go out of their way to find toys that are not the normal plastic stuff you can grab anywhere but beautifully crafted thoughtful items, which makes it possible to get gifts even for the kids who have everything! I absolutely adore their "Social Conscious Library" book section, their books are all about self love and inclusion and are the PERFECT thing for anyone trying to raise a good tiny human. I love this store and wholeheartedly recommend it to any and everyone looking for toys or books for little ones!<//Review>

One of the best children’s stores I’ve ever had the pleasure of stumbling upon. A magical realm where children can explore and create in a safe environment filled to the brim with amazing toys and art supplies. Their dedication to furthering not only children’s intelligence but emotional well being is extremely apparent. I would give this shop a ten star review if I could. Absolutely Onderful 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤<//Text>

This store was our favorite in town. When we moved out of the area, I was most sad about leaving this store but luckily we can still online order. The vibe of this store is just so much love. The owners are amazing and the sweetest. When I am looking for cool, unique toys I check out their online or Instagram first, and if you need some new literature to help continuously raise socially conscience, informed, progressive children, this is the store to check out.
My boys love “the rainbow house store” and always ask to go back!</review>

ONEderChild is the most thoughtfully enchanting, and beautiful toy stores we’ve ever been in. The staff was helpful, full of laughs,  and the whole vibe of the store was a perfect blend of fun and educational; everything a children’s toy store should be. The sweet offerings of woke literature and fun is just the perfect blend to a great experience. Grab some stickers at the checkout by a local artist. They’re fantastic!<//text>

I live about an hour away from Onderchild, but follow them on Instagram because they have such an incredible variety of quality items for kids. When the holidays rolled around, I ordered through their online store and got awesome gifts for my kids and nieces and nephews that I wouldn’t have been able to find anywhere else. The kids loved them! (The unicorn waist pack was especially a hit!) I love supporting this store!< /Text>

Every time I go inside Onderchild, I am instantly happy!!! It is where I go to buy every birthday gift for my kids and their friends. The book section is on point- I never leave without a book! Not only does this store offer so much happiness, it also gives back in a BIG way to local organizations like Angel Foster Care, amazing store with a beautiful  cause behind it!!</review>

<Review>The best shop in Solvang. A must visit. Excellently curated toys, gifts and books!!! The staff is so friendly. They’re beyond cool with kids testing the merch (such a relief in a store). Stop I , say “hi”, grab that gift for your cousin’s baby. It’s the best!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Walked into this store on a road trip from so cal to Paso Robles. I was drawn in by the rainbows, and my wife and I were so happy to see a store full of products for kids with families that look like ours. We have been ordering Christmas and birthday gifts for my nephews since discovering this place, and we can’t wait to visit again on another Solvang trip!< /Review>< Pictures>

<resp>None<//resp><rating>5< /rating><username>Chew This Up< /username><Text>I LOVE SuperFood Cafe. I used to live in Santa Monica, but now I drive there from Marina Del Rey for weekend breakfast. The gluten-free/vegan waffles and pancakes are my favorite. But, we have ordered the chicken sausage scramble (numerous times), sriracha sandwich on gluten-free, superfood smoothie (walnuts, blueberries, etc.), and they have tons of gluten-free baked goodies. We always find street parking. I feel that the prices are comparable for the area. They offer a lot of gluten-free options and some vegan options. And, if you don't have food sensitivities, you will still love the food (says, my family). They don't take reservations, but you don't need one. Many customers order food to go, leaving plenty of indoor and outdoor tables for you. The tables are perfect for 2-3 people. Enjoy them!< /Text><time>1543293623295< /time>< Pictures>

<text>This super cute place is amazing. Loved the food and especially the gluten free waffles 🧇...definitely will be back. I had the chicken sausage scrabbled eggs; it was a little sweet for my liking so I probably wouldn’t order that again. I’ll try something different 🤗< /text>< resp>

<Review>Superfood Cafe is a little gem in Santa Monica.  The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable compared to other eateries in town.  They have WiFi access and all ingredients are mindfully chosen and prepared.  Ask for Sam.  She is super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>All about supporting local businesses, but this place is not worth your time or money, unfortunately. My iced coffee was $7. Smoothies are between $8-$10. The food is extremely underwhelming & terribly overpriced for the quality / presentation of something you’d whip up in your kitchen before running to work. The entrees we ordered only slightly resembled their respective menu descriptions, which was another disappointment after being charged an arm & a leg for beverages alone.</Review>< UserId.>

This has been my boyfriend's and my go-to weekend brunch spot for almost 3 years. While we have tried a number of items on the menu and loved all of them, we still always get the same thing: a breakfast burrito, a pupusa con huevo, and a super smoothie. We love SuperFood because it is colorful, beachy, and friendly just like Santa Monica, the food is consistently amazing, and because of the wonderful staff (we love you Edgar)< /text>

We ate here three times in the two days we were here. The people are so nice, the food is delicious, AND they have vegan, gluten free choices. But good for meat eaters too. This place has it all. Even cute little booths!</Review>

<Text>I've actually eaten at this restaurant many times and the food is actually good but overpriced for what you get. Unfortunately they served me bad fruit in my To Go order that they should have caught because it was obvious. The cashier was very apologetic on the phone and tried to make it right. When I came back however to receive my promised refund the manager was there and was confrontational from the beginning.

I understand mistakes happen and that is why I was polite as was the cashier. The manager however had an attitude and tried to refuse my promised refund. She said I already ate the food and they could give me some fruit but that was it. They claimed they had got some more fruit, which frankly didn't seem sincere. I actually had not even eaten the whole meal since the bad fruit made me sick. After I told her that and that I would not come back if I did not receive a full refund, she questioned the cashier and chastised her for telling me that. She begrudgedly had the cashier give me a refund but was very rude to both of us.

Her behavior was out of line and unnecessary and I will not be back. That's just bad business.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>Avoid! Made an appointment at 4 PM, arrived to hear that the appointment was made at 2.30 PM and the doctors can’t look at me. ( not my fault!)  Drove 30 minutes for nothing, they did not even say sorry, validated my parking or anything! Funny they ask for 5 star reviews, while they don’t ask you to confirm your appointment, to make sure they put in the right time.  Well here is my review, thanks for reminding me of that. Don’t waste your time, the reviews are FAKE on Google  - Check Yelp and all the other sites, you will see that I am not the only one they treated like this - sad!</text>< pictures>

<text>As a first time patient and former Relation Patients Specialist, the front office was quick & efficient in getting me Registered. When I first called to set up an appointment they were able to accommodate me with one for that same week. I did not wait long for the Doctor and his assistant was super helpful. I feel like the drive will definitely be worth it to continue care at this practice.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<UserId.>108027604623816698631</UserId.><rating>5<//rating><date>1614807507554< /date><pics>None</pics><review>I couldn't be more thrilled with the treatment I received at LA Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Allergy.

I've always struggled with breathing through my nose, and have (much to my chagrin) been a life-long mouth breather.  My issues are cause by a naturally narrow nose, and slightly deviated septum.

It wasn't enough to justify a rhinoplasty for me, and I was worried about such major surgery and downtime.

The doctors here recommended that I explore a quick procedure called VivAer, which uses radiofrequency and some manual manipulation to reshape the internal airway and give me more literal breathing room.

The procedure was almost entirely painless, and I had only very minor swelling with no bruising the day following.  I'm three weeks post-procedure now and can already breath so much more easily.

Imagine my delight, then, when in my followup I was told that I could expect continued improvement over the next few weeks.

Everyone here has been so sweet and helpful, and my results were worth every penny.  If you're curious and/or fed up with poor breathing, I heartily recommend the team here!<//review>< response>

Dr Rami is an excellent doctor. However his office staff handling scheduling is a disaster. It is not possible to get anyone on the phone in less than 30 min on hold, often nearly an hour. The staff seem to not be communicating with the individuals actually providing medical care. It's easier to call after hours on the emergency line to get service, or to just show up unannounced.</Text>

My appointment was at 9:30am and I was seen by an assistant at exactly that time.
I was shown to a treatment room and only waited one or two minutes for the doctor and his assistant to come in.
The doctor was friendly, listened to me, asked many pertinent questions and seemed genuinely interested in the issues I had been having with my ears and parotid glands. He was reassuring and suggested a CT scan and a hearing test which were arranged by the support staff along with a follow-up appointment on my way out of the office.
Overall a very pleasant experience</review></record>

The DR, was very good with figuring out what is wrong with my ear and hearing. Then it came to scheduling my surgery. Here’s what has happened. While at my check up before scheduling my procedure, I was told that I didn’t need a covid test for the procedure. I go in office the day of and the receptionist asked if I had a test, not only was I told that I didn’t need one, but no one scheduled a test for me which is the protocol for their office. They rescheduled my appointment for the following week with a booked covid test for the Monday,
4 days before the procedure. I got a call on Thursday the day before the surgery and was let known that because of covid numbers my procedure would have to be rescheduled. Which was actually a good thing because the testing site they sent me to didn’t give me results until the day after my procedure was supposed to happen. They reschedule my procedure once again for this last Monday, I already went on my own to get a covid test to ensure I’d have my results on time; as I’m on the elevator ten minutes before I was due to check in I get a call saying the DR doesn’t have to the tools for the procedure. 10 minutes before... so unprofessional. As I let the surgery department know my concern he said I’m going to rebook you for Wednesday; and I told him there’s a a chance I won’t be able to get Covid test results back in a day. He then told me that he would try to get me a rapid test for the morning of the procedure on Wednesday, and he would call me back for details, but that never happened. Instead I spent all day Tuesday either on hold or waiting for someone to call me back to either cancel or reschedule. I only got a hold of their answering service where a woman named Anna told me she talked to her supervisor and emailed the surgery department with an urgent message to call me back to figure out my options. 5 PM came and went and I never got a hold of anyone from the surgery department. The next day arrives, the now 3rd time when I’m supposed to have the surgery... and no one contacts me. Instead hours later I get a text thanking me for using this ENT clinic even though I never once had the procedure, and then days later a text to rate the experience, so this is where I am. I think that everything has been handled completely wrong and the staff is really unorganized. I did have faith in the DR, but if this is what is happening with the staff I’m not really sure how I feel anymore, and still weighing out if I should wait 3-6 months to see a different ENT.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The only thing I believe needs improvement is the fact that it’s hard to get someone on the phone to make an appointment. The staff is very friendly and professional. The office is very neat. You won’t have any questions unanswered by Dr. Abdou. He makes you feel like you listens to your concerns.<//text>

They can’t manage communication on emails from prospective clients- no way I will let them get near my ear nose throat- no good. All I did was ask about a service and next they bombarded me with how the service was and multiple calls a day to book an appointment- they have no clue how to make a good service impression- not going there and not happy about contacting them. Totally “ unflushable” if you get it... stay safe!<//text>

<Review>I am so glad that my family doctor recommended Dr. Rami Abdou! This office has the best doctoc and staff anyone could ever ask for! Unlike other doctors'offices, I was seen so fast! I barely had to wait a couple of minutes! Dr. Rami Abdou has a great bedside manner, and wonderful smile that brightens your day! He explained every procedure in details and in a language that I can understand! Unlike other doctors who speak in technical medical terms! You would never feel nervous over there because they would put you at ease! The staff is just the best! Everyone is so nice, professional, friendly, and sweet! You can tell that they all love their job and really made for it! I left the office very happy and smiling! I would definitely recommed this doctor to everyone I know! Thank you Dr. Abdou and all the staff for making my day! I greatly appreciate everyone's help at the office and all your hard work! 🤩😍🥰😊😃😁⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐💯👍</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The care side manner of my doctor and PA have been pretty good. However, the support staff has been lackluster. I have received constant text requests to give a review, so here goes. Often the people answering the phone have been difficult to understand, abrupt, and unhelpful. I’ve had to reschedule my appointments twice during the COVID era so this is annoying. I recently had a staff member cancel a procedure  because I hadn’t scheduled a COVID -19 screen. However, the support staff hadn’t mentioned anything about said test after the doctor had ordered the procedure during my previous office visit. I was given an email address to schedule a screening and couldn’t attend due to work commitments. When I tried to schedule a different time, the email contact never circled back with a confirmation. Each time I’ve called, I’ve spent at least 15-30 minutes holding to speak with an office member. They “offer” a call back service, which unfortunately gives you a busy signal and hangs up on you after you sign up for a call back. Currently, I’m waiting on hold today and have waited 16 minutes and am #4 in the call queue. I’d go somewhere else, however, I’ve already had 3 office visits, an MRI, a hearing test, and numerous nasal probes. So, I’m committed already. My primary physician referred me here, but I’m pretty dissatisfied. I’d look somewhere else with a higher level of professionalism. After 3 visits, I can’t blame these factors on somebody having a bad day.< /text>

I really appreciate the care I received from Dr Abdou and his staff. The doctor is a nice person and the conversation with him about my issues was caring, adept, and comfortable. The rest of the staff seems to take on the doctor's professional and pleasant demeanor. Thanks LACENTA! (Also they have an office that is sanitized at a notably higher caliber than most.)<//text>

<Text>Always a pleasant experience. I’ve been seeing Dr. Abdou for almost 3 years now and as a musician who takes his hearing and ear health very seriously I can honestly say that I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Just had my ears cleaned again yesterday and I feel like I have super hearing! Thank you Dr. Abdou, and thank you LACENTA!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I was seen right away, the staff was friendly and pleasant,  and they completely took care of my issue.  (I had a part of a gel earplug lodged in my ear).  Easy to get to- but allow time to find the building in the complex.< /Review>

<review>I brought my 4 year old in for a first appointment with Dr. Rami Abdou, and had a wonderful experience. I have seen other doctors for my son's breathing issues, and not had positive experiences. But Dr. Abdou was warm and polite and easy to talk to, in fact I have never felt so actively listened to by a doctor before. He validated all of my concerns about my son's breathing and gave his recommendation, but was never pushy about treatment. His low-pressure attitude and confidence made me feel 100% secure in putting my son into his hands for surgery. I feel so lucky to have found a fantastic doctor!<//review>< Pictures>

I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Abdou to get checked what I thought were possible vocal nodules. He explained in detail every question I had and told me how the vocal folds work, putting me at ease. The appointment was quick, efficient, and informative. I was prescribed some antibiotics to take care of my less-serious-than-I-thought problem and have a few follow ups left. Definitely look forward to seeing him again.</review>

I’m so happy that I had the pleasure and luck to know dr.Jeffrey Jumaily and dr.Geoffrey Trenkle
Dr.Jeffrey Jumaily was my surgeon for one of the most big surgeries in ENT its : UPPP with Septoplasty  and Rhinoplasty (all in one)
Dr.Jumaily was very professional, listening well to all my concerns, very well mannered, helped me a lot,
The outcome for my surgery is amazing,dr.Jeffrey is really gifted, I got back to work today (only 10 days after).
Great experience with everyone who works here, very friendly and very nice people,<//Text>

The entire staff was delightful....and I can not say enough about the Doctor.I have been seeing alot of Drs lately and have never felt the sincere caring that I  felt from him. He took the time to sit next to me and explain my situation and my options. I felt somehow empowered when I left his office. He is definitely following his passion. He is a wonderful Doctor.<//review>

Dr. Abdou calming, reassuring, and comes across like a real human being. He takes a lot of the intimidation out of doctor’s visits. He also seems like he’d be mad chill to party with. —Stapes</Text>

The BEST medical experience I have ever had. Dr. Abdou is honestly a godsend and and true professional.  The staff along with Dr. Abdou care about the wellbeing of their patients, and go far and beyond for them.  I feel lucky to have had such great team take care of me during what was the most scariest time of my life when I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  Without the care and support of these individuals my experience could have been very different.  I am eternally grateful to Dr. Abdou and this team.< /review>

<Text>I supposed the one good thing about getting hit in the face by a Ferris wheel is discovering Dr. Abdou, my now lifetime ENT doctor.

I couldn’t recommend Dr. Abdou more highly.

I recently had a Septoplasty procedure and my wife had to have the same procedure a few years ago. Our experiences were night and day.

While she suffered for weeks and had about 100ft of gauze dissolving in her nose- I know because I had to pull it out (and nearly fainted in the process), Dr. Abdou used internal splints which he removed about 1 week after surgery... and it just wasn’t that bad!

After he removed the splints- I could breathe better than I have ever remembered breathing in my life... I was greeted by a fresh lemony scent- which I then discovered to be purel hand sanitizer all the way across the office! Amazing!

In all seriousness Dr. Abdou is a very gifted ENT doctor... and I feel a little safer knowing that, although genetically predisposed to ear and sinus infections, I can go to the Los Angeles Center for Ear, Nose, and Throat- with the full confidence that I will be receiving the highest possible standard of care.<//Text>< pictures>

<Time>1524070637741<//Time><Review>Dr. Rami Abdou is GEM! This man went into medicine for all the right reasons; to help people. I first met Dr. Abdou back in November 2017 when I started having an issue with my throat. Before seeing Dr. Abdou, I had seen an Otolaryngologist in Glendale who told me everything was fine. Now I know my body and I knew something was off, so with the help of my primary physician, I was referred to Dr. Abdou at the Los Angeles Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Allergy at the Hollywood office. From the moment I met Dr. Abdou I had a feeling he would get to the root of my issue which at this point had become unbearable. Within a minute of performing an endoscopy, he found a mass in my throat. I started to freak out and he quickly calmed me and discussed the my best course of treatment. He told me and I’ll never forget, “ I’d be a bad doctor if I just performed a biopsy and didn’t remove the tumor at the same time.” I didn’t know if it was benign or malignant, but knowing that I had this “thing” in my throat really affected me emotionally! Within 3 weeks of my initial diagnosis, I had to procedure done. The first thing he told me as soon as I awoke from the anesthesia was “benign!” He gave me my life back at that moment. Since then, he’s also had to perform a tonsillectomy on me with amazing results. I have healed beautifully from both surgeries and now my father is a patient of his too!

I can’t even begin to describe how grateful I am to Dr. Abdou. I’m not one to use to word “love” loosely, but I do LOVE this man! He is by far one of the best doctor’s I’ve ever had. His professionalism is top notch. He takes his time with you, you never feel rushed and you can definitely tell he has your best interest at heart. This man is very passionate about what he does and it shows in his work.

If you’re looking for an Otolaryngologist, please see Dr. Abdou. I guarantee you he will win you over with his professionalism and expertise. Additional perks; he’s easy on the eyes and funny too!< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< Name>

Dr. Abdou truly cares about his patients, which makes all the difference in the world. After a surgery I was able to email him with any questions and concerns and he personally got back to me immediately.</Review>

I've had a unit here for years with no issues regarding the unit. They did change gate access hours at some point during COVID and they are crazy strict - you MUST be out by 6 p.m during the week and 5 pm on weekends, but you can go in as early as 6 a.m. because that's necessary?! I'm hoping they return to the old hours of 'until 9 p.m.' or maybe try sunrise to sunset, but 6 p.m. makes unit runs challenging after work.< /text>

Very high priced and doesn't offer any discounts or understanding due to covid-19. No payments plans or anything and even raised their price twice during hard times. They don't care how long you've been a customer, give them their money or get your stuff out before they take it out. Basically< /text>

I have been witmmmh them for about 15 months and have been consistently well taken care of and have had no real issues. Unfortunately I went from paying $64 a month to now, less than a year and a half later, I'm paying $98!! That's insane and makes me feel like I'm getting taken advantage of. Besides all of that, the last thing that has been the same since the day I started renting from them is that the driveway is on an angle that has literally made my car bottom out every time I go there! The problem is so obvious that I truly thought Public Storage would have fixed it a long time ago. I have even mentioned it to them twice but it's still the same. For the record my car is a BMW sedan that hasn't been lowered. I can only imagine what's happened to other people's cars. So here it is simply put Public Storage.... Go hire a couple concrete guys to come out and grind it down. It would literally take a two man crew 3 hours max. So with it being so easy, quick and inexpensive WHY haven't you fixed it? I would love to hear the reason.</review>

<Text>Sam was very knowledgable. He helped me reduce my cost for storage I’ve had for five years. Pro tip: keep everything packed in good boxes if you plan to store long term and keep an eye on the going rates as they tend to fluctuate while your rate will continue to increase periodically. Then when the price is right do a transfer. I was able to get the same size for a lower rate. Having everything packed right made it easy to move. I got all my boxes from Sam. Thanks again Sam the man!<//Text><userid>106246168254097578961< /userid>< time>

<review>Was there less than a month happened to be on the property after hours. As a result no warning, no conversation and I got a 72-hour vacate order. The manager, Sam, passed the buck and said it wasn’t his decision and gave me a phone number to the regional manager who won’t answer or return any calls. I’m paid in full and don’t see anywhere their legal right to tell me I have less than 3 days and then they’re going to dispose of my belongings or as Sam told me “throw it away”.< /review><Time>1581813648886</Time><Rating>1</Rating>< user_name>

Sam, the manager of this site, was so kind and helpful. He helped me find a replacement unit after the one I originally reserved became unavailable. I am a first time storage unit renter and Sam guided me through each and every step. Highly recommend this location!</Text>

< review>
I am new to public storage.  The fellow at the front desk was wildly helpful, accomodating, and friendly.   I got there where there was a limited time-window for set-up but he made it happen (good because that was the day I had my rental truck)!  So far so good.  The facility seems to be clean and well-run.<//review>

The 5 stars is for Marina who works at this property. I couldn’t ask for a smoother, easy, no stress experience. Marina knew I was overwhelmed with my move but she offered solutions, gave me all the information I needed, checked me out seamlessly and provided impeccable service! She was very knowledgeable and a total professional. I can’t thank her enough and the help alone makes me always want to use public storage!</review>

<review>Marina was so helpful in getting my little storage unit set up! From the moment I realized I needed a unit to the moment I was all set with all my stuff in the storage it took maybe 30 minutes? She is so friendly, kind and helpful, I wish everyone provided customer service at this level! Marina made me an advocate for public storage because of how easy she made the whole process! Thank you!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

We had a delightful time with Patricia.  She was instrumental in renting my wife and I a storage unit in a relatively short period time.  We gave us a tour of the facility along a detailed explanation of the locks codes needed to enter the facility
And our unit.  I would highly recommend Patricia to anyone wishing to rent a storage unit at this location.<//review>

<response>None<//response><Rate>5</Rate><text>I have had to move Self-Storage places twice the last 5 years due to the locations being closed. Finally had it with San Francisco and looked for a location outside the city. Read the great reviews for this business and after signing up for a new unit today I'd like to add my own positive review. Cliff was the agent who helped my wife and I out and he was totally on the ball—from the moment I walked in the office to the signing of papers. He walked us through everything; the grounds, the units, insurance and the finer details of the paperwork. He made suggestions on products we should get for our unit and told us about the specials that they had on boxes and all the different sizes in stock. He didn't rush through the information. He was concise and to the point. He valued our time as he valued his. Lastly I was also impressed at how he dealt with another customer while he was busy with us. He was polite, gave the gentleman a time quote on how long it was going to take to wrap up our business and suggested a neighboring location if he was in a rush. Great customer service! Cliff was efficient, polite, and knowledgeable. The location itself was fine. Clean and in good working order and much cheaper than what we were paying downtown SF with better security. We don't mind the drive.< /text><user_name>Rick Gaston<//user_name>< gmap_id>

So far my experience with this location has been amazing, Nicole, Dino, and Buddy have all been great and customer service has been outstanding. I just started using storage with them and so far I've been helped with everything I need, they have been patient, gave me the best possible deal on my unit, and walked with me to choose between several locations and preferences.
I am hoping that I will be able to write another excellent review once I am done renting my space. Great team! friendly as well.

<Text>I have been a tenant at this Public Storage location for many years, under multiple leases.

In spite of the fact that there are multiple storage locker facilities in this particular area – including other Public Storage locations – I continue to rent storage space at this location due to the high performance and tremendous customer service provided by one employee in particular – Dino, the Property Manager.

Dino is very professional and personable. He is prompt at returning phone calls, polite, and efficient. His management of the property allows me to leave my valuables stored at Public Storage without any worry or concern about the safety of my possessions.

Dino makes certain that this Public Storage location is kept safe, secure, and clean. He credibly assures his customers that he will protect their valuables and possessions. He offers solid advice about storage units and is always ready to assist.

And, finally, Dino does all of these wonderful things with a smile! And, therefore, Dino makes it a pleasure to do business at this Public Storage location.<//Text>< pics>

I just rented a storage space here and the customer service was amazing. Brittney helped me with everything I needed even though I had a ton of changes happening! I got a great price and I was able to see the different sizes of units to fit my liking.

Looks like they have security cameras and an up to date lock system to keep properties safer. No troubles so far. Customer service was awesome.<//text>

The costumer service was extremely helpful and very aware of the property. We are a family moving across the state we were greeted with a friendly face, and a knowledgeable representative which helped to make our stressful trip a little bit easier.

The property is clean, and very accommodating to anyone looking to store property they care about. With the affordable prices and super great service, we couldn't possibly go anywhere else.

Thanks Brittany and Public Storage</review>

We were looking for a storage space to accommodate a house full of furniture and had reserved a space online for the Meath location. When we arrived Cliff showed us the 2 available spaces and was extremely knowledgeable in telling us about the spaces and how to place our items in the rooms in the most advantageous way. Unfortunately, neither of the available rooms suited our needs. Cliff volunteered to research other local PS storage facility options advising sizes, prices and other info about those locations. He was extremely helpful and thanks to him we easily found a spot that was perfectly matched to our needs. Thank you Cliff you're awesome!<//text>

I recently rented a small unit at Public Storage, and Cliff was amazing.  He was very attentive and professional.  He knows the business backward and forward and was able to recite all of the necessary information very articulately.  It was a pleasure to see this young man take so much pride in his job.  It gave me great confidence in using this facility to hold my belongings.</review>

<Text>I've had several public storage units in the past and this is the best customer service I have ever had. Cliff was really really helpful and had excellent advice regarding the type of storage unit and etc. He spent a lot of time making sure i understood everything. He never too pushy or didn't make me feel rushed. I had only came in there to get information and look at some pricing. I didn't even purchase a storage that day but he still have excellent service! Would definitely come back in the future.< /Text>< Pics>

I recently rented a small unit at Public Storage, and Cliff was amazing.  He was very attentive and professional.  He knows the business backward and forward and was able to recite all of the necessary information very articulately.  It was a pleasure to see this young man take so much pride in his job.  It gave me great confidence in using this facility to hold my belongings.<//text>

<Review>Apparently your get lock in on the property after 9!!!!!! I have been stuck for almost an hours. Not getting a single call returned or anything. Nobody did a round to check and see if there was anybody on the property? The sign for the lock time is so small it has to be for novelty purposes. The price is great. Having to call emergency services to be able to go home at night is not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>I love how public storage's are everywhere.  I recently moved to a smaller place
and all my belongings would not fit.  Right down the street was a Public Storage
facility,  The young man in the office (Christian) I think, was so helpful. I loved how
clean & secure it looked,  He helped me choose the right size unit for my thing.
And the price was just right.  Thanx....<//Review></record>

This has always been my favorite under-the-radar storage location.  The property manager, Britney, is nothing short of a rock star; very impressive.  Cliff has also been a great help when I've had questions.  Great property and now also very well-managed and staffed.< /review>

My public storage experience has been great!  A young man named Cliff is who has assisted me throughout the process.  He is very helpful, courteous, and he has definitely  made the experience much easier for me.

I had to move due to unforeseen circumstances which caused a deal of stress but Cliff made dealing with storing my things much easier.<//Review>

Brittney was amazing.  All other places near Daly City was going to cost $170.  Brittney was able to get me a storage unit for less cost and near my daughter's Apt.   Brittney was friendly, professional and very organized.  She definitely is the reason, I would do business again with Public Storage... specifically where Brittney manages.  Thank you.</review>

A couple of weeks ago at the end of the Month of June. I need a storage ASAP. I called and made a appointment with the Manager (Cliff) on Meath Drive. Not only did I rent a storage unit, he gave it to us half of for the first Month.

Keep up the good work.

Thank You,

3:15 pm. Didn't have any tenders ready. Told them I would be back in 40 minutes. Bag had only 1/2 my order. Ordered popcorn while waiting for them to cook more tenders. Asked twice for sauce. Manager had a REAL attitude and threw sauce in bag. Won't go back there!< /review>

<Text>Extremely slow because of staff shortage and/or lack of food prepared and ready to go. Everyone had to wait for their food about 16 to 36 minutes. Well I guess it was freshly made but it was a mad scramble to pull it off. Other than that its basic KFC. Now abot the restroom.  The floor was slimy slippery. You stand to do your business and notice your feet sliding apart. Remedy is to clean the mop and bucket properly or replace then stay on track with cleaning the mop and bucket. That slime is grease and degreaser and heavy bacteria from not properly cleaning the tools.</Text>< Rating>

If I could give no stars I would, worst KFC ever. I came here on my lunch and the sign says open and everything was functional I even see a worker in there eating and the doors are locked and supposedly their closed. I'm never coming back here again.<//review>

<Text>No sense of urgency what so ever. Obviously my order didn’t come out correct the first time, had to wait longer than usual to get my correct one. The employees here seem to drag their feet everywhere not wanting to work with no direction or organization. I don’t even want to get into all the health code violations I saw while waiting behind the counter, but for starters never pick at your face when your working with food, that’s the grossest thing ever. Water was also coming from the back seeping out into the dining room with no wet floor sign on the way to the entrance to the bathroom. If I was the person who owned this franchise I would be utterly ashamed and embarrassed , it gives the KFC branding such a bad name.< /Text>< GmapID>

Not knowing that i speak spanish i asked them if they were closed and they said no we are open. It seems like they are lazy the sign at the door said 10pm and it was 9pm.<//Text>< Pictures>

<resp>None< /resp><review>This is the Slowest fast food restaurant I have ever been to. I don't go here very often, but whenever I do there's only two people working. One person is in back cooking astuff while theres only ever one person in the front of the store taking orders and bagging up the food. Takes me 20-40 mins to get out of this store every time.< /review><user>112931045786769940327<//user>< Time>

The food is sometimes OK. The staff is marginal. Many times they have run out of the items I want to eat. It's good to have a second choice...<//review>

This store is terrible. The employees are rude, careless, immature, and improperly trained. They always mess up our orders, not have the regular items we want available during the lunch or dinner hours. Different cashiers always ring up our order higher than what it should be and the prices are never the same. I'm always completing the surveys and even called to raise the concerns with the manager. But nothing has improved at this store. I end up going the Fremont Blvd location which is farther away but their service is so much better and they have the items available we want at the same price every time.<//Review>

Not the best KFC. Chicken was a little dry and biscut seemed thin.

Staff was pleasant and they kept it clean while i was there. They are really cramed into this space but make it work.

If i would return i give minimum 3 stars. 2 stars says I'll not return.</Review>

< review>
Worst customer service experienced. Employees are rude and careless.
I ordered 8 piece chicken. All the chicken were old, spiceless, and dry. I waited about 20 minutes for the order that was less than $15. When I asked them to cancel my order and give my money back, they told me that they can't do that. I called this restaurant  and asked if I could talk to the manager, then they told me that manager was not there. I called later and that same person who answered the phone first time was pertaining to be the manager. It a ripoff.<//review>

<Review>While visiting my grandma in Central California, we decided to visit this beach, after coming here numerous times in the years prior. The beach is fantastic during low tide. It is notorious for containing multiple tide pools, as well as rocky beaches and rocks to climb. Wildlife as always is present, and you can get some fantastic pictures here. Parking and restrooms are, not a problem in this area, as they're both nearby. This is a fantastic place for pictures, as it provides interesting rock formations. If you can, climb up the big rock that's located on the north-western point of the beach, and you will get some fantastic shots of the scenery. Coming here during high-tide is not advised, as none of the things mentioned above are accessible due to the high water level. All in all, a great place to come especially if you're in the area.<//Review>< user>

<text>I was visited this beach on July/10/20.
It is small beach but it is perfect for all ages.
It has everything I’m looking for.
There is no parking fee, and street parking too.
It has a basic bathroom, no sink, but its clean when I was there.
It is breathtaking and fun place.
All little and big rocks come with different colors and shapes, they are very pretty.
If you like to collect rocks, this is the beach for you to find your favor.
It has few little caves, interesting rock formations, cliffs for me to hop back and forth very fun, and a huge adventure rock to climb up to enjoy the view of the Pacific Ocean.
I definitely will come back here again.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJafMFS2zFhIysB29bbsgAcImlna-SqvxX7EfH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP18RndVO8eUO1eu6-rwySnNUAx8xNII7E73EA0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdvUK854tOzbH2Jj_BY7LE91VuzBlPHNhCpSD1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmvmza9zLfx5t9XjOq4NVQ4xSWOQLzXEewa_pQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRJ0xoGQQAhpb07gqWm0IJVTkgr-V_kIuVt8tc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOcbbfooIV8_oj6w0RvbB_eLZPeYAF_EmkwQer=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6Aweo_5W28M73xWRFN-ZPk0Hea-jRKCp92oGE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZWxgviE003s3o-Nuh3dtU0mSl64Okh7zg8Etl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiTYnYWBYt65b6gzfqWkUZEb69QVVWcBJEabDM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsmXn13U5w8lyY9tggDtCAL7sSFin6ZpmOeR8q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWVaMtlezZSABuJ7XjFcTwBIYRvFZyNnWsK9Z2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlDlyPr3CHFmGDxpNrXvKEB1xUPZ0SNCaCTaCs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

This was a great little part of the beach to come and visit. There wasn’t too many people but the parking lot was somewhat small. There’s a great variety here, from the beach to hiking paths and the cliff side views.<//Review>

<review>Beautiful and fun place. Very basic bathroom. No sink. All the rocks here were beautifully sanded down by the waves crashing into the Ricky mountains by the beach. Love this place! We plan to come here again in the future</review>< Pics>

<Text>Neat cove with some unique rock formations. The beach is more rocky than sandy but a good place to hike or picnic for the day. There are restrooms but no washing facilities just the bare essentials. About 20 minutes south of Morro Bay along some winding narrow but well kept roads.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3CLli3OEOviYfDch68vKu7rbgum9Pt3xEB_0M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtWTtZ6FZfW2etKOXm6221iS3Pyf3jftoQxttA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiqDh3lGmsFcmdyF62ZZkq8F8YRReK9kRC8687=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHe23V1hJEqfNyFsUgB3EUIPhnQY7sHADZtwmT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80ece2a59aa8b0b7:0x72acfa44627e63b1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Phenomenal. Such a nice small beach with great picture opportunities. I found an abalone shell, intact and a lobster tail. Such cool findings and nice slow walking. There are bathrooms here, but it's basically a port a potty with a real building. No water to wash your hands with either. Plenty of parking. DON'T FORGET YOUR CAMERA!</review>

<text>Beautiful cove. Rock formations are so cool. Sand is much coarser than typical. I think it is the only spot in Montana de Oro State Park that dogs are welcome.</text></record></dataset><record>

So beautiful. Every corner is different and spectacular even in the minutiae of different textures on the ground. Highly recommend also hiking to the cliff top next to the cove for even more beautiful views<//Review>

<Review>Beautiful Spooner’s Cove is located in Montaña de Oro State Park.   During the spring months there is a lovely lagoon.  The sea is very rough and swimming is not recommended.   Very busy on weekends and holidays.  Parking is limited.  Dogs may be on the beach but must be leashed.<//Review>< time>

Beautiful and usually not too busy. The sand is coarse and rocky, so it's not really a strolling beach, but it's great for relaxing and finding shells and listening to the waves.<//Review>

<text>Spooner's Cove is a secluded rocky cove on the Pacific coast of the California Central Coast, sheltered by cliffs with tide pools. Perfect for avoiding crowds in these times. The layered rock I believe is ancient sedimentary ocean floor deposits< /text><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Beautiful place to experience the power of the ocean by watching the waves crash into the rocky coast. If you like to collect rocks and shells, you could sit for hours and find some interesting pieces. Lots of small chunks of jade can be found if you look hard enough. A curvy road to get there but a must visit place  if you are in the area.<//Review><gmapID>0x80ece2a59aa8b0b7:0x72acfa44627e63b1< /gmapID><user_id>114622166617360728933</user_id><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None</Pics><time>1578686481493< /time><username>ross krumland</username><Response>None< /Response></record>

It's not our family favorite place.  Its secluded and pretty but the rocky beach makes it a huge pain on your feet.  I feel like I cut the bottom of my feet and took a day to heal<//text>

This one of my favorite beaches in California, I've been coming here for over 40 years. It still makes me feel happy when I get here and find a couple of gems on the beach.< /Review>

Beautiful beach and good for the kids to walk around. We went down a cove and skipped rocks. Bring enough water. They even have some restrooms along the way.<//review>

There were family's with pets. It didn't detract from the ambiance for me but I suppose it could if children or dogs annoy you. I would recommend wearing tennis shoes the pebles hurt to walk on and there are some nice big rocks to clime on but I didn't feel safe doing so in flip flops.</Review>< username>

< Review>
I Love Spooners Cove and Montana de Oro campground. Bern coming here off and on  over 30yrs. Spotted a tooth in the sand, water went out, came back in and as I try to get away from it, well let's just say I was no longer dry.< /Review>

<Text>Spooner's Cove is a great little beach that gives you access to the bluff trail and some really nice ocean scenery. We could watch the waves and sea lions all day, very beautiful area.</Text>< pics>

<Review>It is always great to go there with my cousins, there is a wide variety of thing you can do there, if you are lucky the tide will be low and you can go explore the caves. It has a great view of the ocean especially if you climb onto the giant rock you can see everything. It has a fresh water steam/pond that come down and meets with the ocean which is great for the kids to play in on a warm day.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>This to me is a hidden gem, the beach is a rock beach, meaning it's mostly ground up shale rock and other ocean things.  It's not Rocky or in comfortable to walk on bare foot.  The cove isn't really for boogie boarding or surfing.  My family and I love the trails and beautiful views.  Also, go see the historical shop above the cove.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Beautiful! It's not a sandy beach, it's more pebble-like. A bit of a drive and limited cell service, but worth it for the view and tranquility. Also, be aware that the restroom is more of an outhouse, but it's something!< /Text>

< Review>
This stretch of beach will always have a special place in my heart. During early morning hours and most weekdays it's a delight to visit, but on weekends and holiday seasons it's absolutely chaotic. There are always a few strange characters wondering Spooner's as well, so do be aware of your surroundings.</Review>

Love this place. It's beautiful and peaceful. The walking trails along the bluffs offer wonderful views. The campground is basic with pit toilets and shorter parking pads at the sites which limits accessibility by larger RVs. There is a restored ranch house that offers tours and has a small nature store (no groceries). The aggressive racoons can be a problem.< /Review>

Quiet beach with some wind protection. The actual material that you are walking on is small pebbles as apposed to sand, so have shoes handy. Can get busy during summer and weekends. The beach area near the water is very steep.< /text>

The beautiful, small cove with rocky shoreline has a quaint old fashioned feel to it. Its  small creek and hillside with Monterey Pines add a protected natural environment to relax and enjoy it's natural wonders. Definitely a place to return to.</Review>
