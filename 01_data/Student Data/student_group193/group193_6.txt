<text>This is by far the BEST place I have ever been to to get waxed.  The staff are all so friendly and the studio vibe is easy going and relaxed. They have me in and out in very little time and they follow Covid-19 protocol easily.  I have been coming here for 2 years, and I have been waxed by most of the staff.  I can't say enough about this place!!  Easy, Fun, Professional!!  So happy to feel normal again after a long 2020!!</text>< Rating>

Every technician there is friendly and knowledgeable.  Their scheduling system makes it easy to schedule or adjust appointments. I've been more then satisfied for every tanning and wax service I've had done.<//Review>

I have never left this place crying but today. I definitely did. I use to love this place because I have really sensitive skin and their wax is gentle on my skin. I would drive from Los Angeles for 2 hours to San Diego just to use them. However, after my last experience I really understand the person makes the difference. My service was booked with Viviana. Not by choice but I selected the next person available.  I was running late as halfway to San Diego there was a deadly car crash that blocked the I-5 for 45 minutes. I called the location and informed them of what was going on, they said no problem just know  some of your services (bigger services such as legs) would not be able to fit into your appointment time.  I  had no issue with that as I understood I was the one running late.  Upon my arrival I was told the appointment was canceled as I took too long (even though I still had 35 minutes remaining on my appointment time, a 5 minute underarm service could of still been provided)  and their was another client coming. And Under normal circumstances they only wait 5 minutes.... Why would that not be mentioned on the phone when I specifically said I was driving from LA and their had been an accident? I could of saved my headache, gas, 3 hours on the road and just turned around and gone home. That’s not the worst part. The worst part is, I was sent a link to rebook my appointment. I click the link and it offers me to rebook my 5 minutes underarm waxing at 4:40PM (20 minutes before they close).  I booked it, was sent a  confirmation text, and email,  so I waited in my car. At 4:32PM I walked up to the door,  and it was locked. Viviana was inside but was yelling through the door. After a while of seeing I couldn’t hear her she came to the door to inform me they are closed, she clocked out already and so that’s that. I told her I had an appointment for 4:40PM and thought don’t close until 5PM she told me that’s not true because there was nothing in the computer saying I have an appointment. And she clocked out so.....  I showed her my confirmation. She said again “well I clocked out already”. I asked her if I could use the bathroom and I would just leave after that and head back to L.A. she told me No as once again “she clocked out already” and was the only person there.  I’m not understanding how after  driving 3 hours. Something as simple as “may I at least pee in your toilet?” Gets a “I clocked out” and the store is still technically open for another 24 minutes.  I assume it’s personal. Maybe my being black was an issue as I’ve never met this woman in my life to be treated like a liar and  like I was the one who had done something wrong when I was simply following a link they sent. I’ve never been treated like I was doing something wrong by asking to use the bathroom in a location where I would be a paying customer. I did not expect any major favors after my 3 hour road trip, but I at least expected that if they asked me to rebook they would honor that rebooking. If the computer is wrong then they need to update their system instead of confirming appointments for the client then claiming to be clocked out when you get there.</text>

I got in on a next day appointment - their system
Is very easy to use and book with. I ended up having to change times last minute and they were very accommodating.

My actual wax was with Bree. She was very sweet, asked questions about my previous wax experiences, and she was fast (which I like- it somehow hurts less).

I only took away a star because it was too fast - and when you’re that fast, you’re not very thorough. I felt a little rushed, and there were some areas she could’ve taken more time on. But it’s an appointment based business so I get it- the more appointments you get the more money you get. I would definitely go back but I just know what to expect.

Heads up- they use a combination of hard wax and soft wax. Soft wax strips that top layer of skin causing some sensitivity. Just so you know.< /Review>

Based on the reviews I’m sure it would have been a better experience but unfortunately they cancelled on ME last minute after I booked an appointment a day in advance. On top of the confusion I got an email saying my appointment was 20 min later than what I set. Probably won’t try this place again<//review>

First rate waxing studio. Friendly staff, extremely efficient and great attention to detail. Even though they are on busy Adams Ave, the parking lot in back makes it really convenient. I have the monthly plan now, making this a superb value.< /text>

I was fully expecting to love this place after reading the reviews but my actual experience was lack luster. I scheduled a French bikini wax and face wax. After the waxer completed my face wax, I noticed that my sideburns were uneven and I had stray hairs left on my face. I immediately asked to use her tweezers to remove the stray hairs and I asked her to make my sideburns even. It took 2 attempts to even out my sideburns which left them shorter than desired. She kindly filled in my eyebrows after waxing them which I appreciated, but when I got home and removed the make up, I noticed stray hairs that I needed to clean up. I was mostly satisfied with my French bikini wax. My only complaint is that the top wasn't waxed in a straight line. My remaining hair is a bit slanted and oddly rounded at the top. I will say that the staff are friendly and professional. However, in my opinion, the outcome of the services and the experience did not align with the price point or my expectations. Unrelated to the service, the parking situation is a bit difficult to maneuver. Beware when entering the parking area or exiting, you may have to reverse to make room for a car coming toward you in the opposite direction.</review>

My favorite place! Sabrina is so sweet and really gentle. My skin is very sensitive and she never fails to treat me right. I’ve been following her for years and won’t see anyone else. Her listening and communication is key she makes sure I understand what is being done and the expected result. I always recommend her to my friends and coworkers and some have even became regulars like myself. My advice book with her asap before she schedule packs up!!!<//Text>

<Review>Cute wax bar located in Normal Heights/ Kensington. I usually get me waxes done by Bree and she’s amazing! Appointments are always very prompt. She does a great job and it’s as painless as possible. She’s always a good conversation to take your mind off the waxing and makes sure to get rid of any stragglers. Bonus, she has a good show playing in the background!</Review>< Date>

Recently new to San Diego and I was on the hunt for a waxing studio. I am a travel nurse and have to find new waxing studios in every state I go to. With so many options I happened to come across this gem. This was the FIRST and ONLY place I tried. I booked my first visit with Angie for a Brazilian. I waited several days to see my results. I was so pleased that I went back in shortly after for my underarms. My appointment went smooth. I walked in, was greeted right away, offered a beverage, and waited only a few minutes until Angie came out. Angie is a really sweet and professional esthetician! She made me feel comfortable, answered all my questions, and even gave me some helpful tips. Being a nurse, I always watch for the cleanliness of the esthetician and facility. Angie exceeded my expectations, she changed her gloves, never double dipped, and went from clean to dirty areas without cross contaminating. I am really glad I found this waxing studio. They offer an awesome monthly membership for Brazilians, which I highly recommend!</Text>

I had an awesome experience with Sabrina! I’ve been waxing for a while now and have had many waxers over the years but none of them were as quick and thorough as her. She was also very sweet and friendly which made me feel very comfortable. Needless to say, I will definitely be returning!< /Review>

Very flexible with scheduling if I have a problem getting to an appointment. Very open to any way I want my brows shaped, getting my lashes done I always leave there feeling so pretty. The staff is so sweet and I would recommend them to everyone !!<//review>

The girl, thay goes by coco that works here insulted my friend and made here cry. She said loud enough for her to hear, "I hate fat people". It was so incredibly rude and hurt my friends feelings . The girl that did mine had to make rude comments that my friends overheard about me too even.<//text>

<Review>I love coming here, not only because it is close to where I live. But the girls there are GREAT. I go to get waxed by Rachel, n she's amazing as it is. Very professional n funny at the same time. She definitely helps remove the first time jitters n after that it's smooth sailing. I highly recommend coming to Elixr Wax Bar!.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5< /Rate><gmap_id>0x80d9544c21542899:0x2f09c5a8d697c788<//gmap_id>< username>

< Review>
I've been a loyal client every month since 2013 (it has gone thru a few name changes since then lol), and I would NEVER go anywhere else.  Hands down, this is the best wax boutique in the county.  I think I first found them (then 'Wax in the City') on Yelp - and was very impressed by the reviews, so decided to check it out.  The boutique is so cute.  The girls are the sweetest, most friendly people - and I love my Angie!  This place is Clean, clean, clean!   The wax they use is top of the line, and they use different types of wax on different parts - so they obviously know what they're doing.  And in all the years I have been going, I have Never seen anyone Double Dip!  Don't cancel last minute/no-show - it'll cost you!  These girls rely on their appointments, and they fill up quickly... I think walk-ins might have a tough time, because this place is regularly booked solid (but that's what happens when you're the best).  Their booking website is really easy to use, and you can make any changes to your appointment.  Hey!  If you're a student, you can get a special discount on Thursdays - I love that!  I have never been to their downtown location - but Angie only works at Normal Heights, so that's where I go.  I hear it's really nice, though.
Go. Ask for Angie. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

They do a good job however, I never seem to see the person I schedule with. I'm not a fan of surprises, at least let me know in advance that the person I'm scheduled with will not be in do I can decide to reschedule or not instead of arriving to get the surprise.</review>

I have been going to Waltz Family Chiropractic for many years - they are excellent. I feel very fortunate to be able to see Kara for chiropractic work and Nicole for massage - both are kind and expert. Thank you</Text>

<rate>2< /rate><text>After reading the many wonderful reviews about Dr. Kara, I had high anticipation for our initial visit. I was fairly disappointed in said initial visit. While I'm sure Dr. Kara is quite skilled at her work, I felt our visit lacked thoroughness. For example, it appeared my intake form had been skimmed through for the first time within the context of our initial visit. My initial "exam" seemed to only consist of a simple range of motion observation of my neck. Lastly, following my adjustment, there was no discussion on treatment plan, findings or recommendations moving forward. I had to inquire about this and felt rushed out when I did, as Dr. Kara's next client was waiting to be seen. This combination (in addition to Dr. Kara briefly playing with my hair) was unsettling, and did not help me to feel valued as a patient.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great chiropractor to work with for a newbie to chiropractic care! Dr. Waltz was recommended by a family member and I am so glad I went. I highly recommend her! (and she is a trauma-informed and intuitive practitioner, which is always a plus!)<//Text>

I have been a client for massage therapy to address shoulder constriction from a surgery 12 years ago.  After a couple months of regular appointments, Nicole unwound over a decade of constriction, and on top of that I’ve learned about my own body through her explanations, insights and instruction.  Highly recommended.</review>

< Review>
I have been seeing Dr. Kara for a few years now and I have made so much progress getting myself adjusted with her. She’s helped me to get out of neck and shoulder pain, sleep better, and feel so much more calm in general. I can’t thank or recommend her enough. I have been to many chiropractors and have finally found my match! Dr. Kara listens to me and is always very in tune with what is happening in my body. She is also always happy to recommend ways that I can be taking the best care of myself in between visits, and I love doing the regiments that I have from her such as specific foam rolling exercises and deep spinal stretches. You have helped me in so many ways Dr. Kara, I hope that people will find this review helpful and know there is a great chiropractor they can trust right here in Rockridge.<//Review>

I had a motorcycle accident some time ago and had to get the 'main-frame' straightened back out. It was luckily nothing too serious, but it was enough to be a constant nuisance in the weeks that followed the accident.
I booked a couple of sessions with Kara and that was practically all it took. It was my first time ever to visit a chiropractor and I have to say I'm extremely satisfied with the outcome.</Text>

<Review>I was referred to Dr. Kara after getting into a rear end car accident. I have never gotten chiropractic work done before so I was a bit anxious. I was particularly nervous about getting my neck adjusted, but because the person who referred me has been going to her for years, I was able to relax into my adjustments. Dr Kara's demeanor is very welcoming and calming. There were a few times that I forgot to mention problem spots and she intuitively targeted those spots with just the right amount of pressure to give me relief and/or increased mobility. The series of adjustments and recommended massage therapy sessions (by Nicole in the same office) have drastically decreased my pain and increased my mobility. I've always had an aversion to deep tissue massage, but Nicole did such a great job at softening my really tight problem spots that now I don't mind it. She has great bedside manner and does a great job being intuitive about when to adjust her pressure to be stronger or gentler.  I've had such a great experience here that I plan to incorporate chiropractic adjustments and massage therapy as part of my wellness care once my car accident case is resolved. The office is very clean and offers a relaxing ambiance despite being on a fairly busy street. The location of this office is very convenient since it is located just a few blocks from BART and the freeway. On the days that I've driven to the office, I've never had an issue finding parking nearby.< /Review><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

I have always had a great experience with Kara! She takes the time to really get to know you and your body. Most of all, it feels like she really cares about your overall health and isn’t just wanting to put a bandaid over a wound, but fix the underlying problem!<//Review>

I've been going to Dr. Kara for years when I need an adjustment, and I trust her completely. I always leave her office feeling like the adjustment helped, and usually with some good advice about what to do going forward to maintain the positive effects of the treatment. She's also just a really nice person!< /Review>

<review>Great and thoughtful chiropractic care -- Dr. Waltz did an excellent job diagnosing my back issue and realigning me accordingly.  My back was incredibly responsive to her approach I was fully better after just a couple of sessions.  Highly recommend!< /review>< name>

I first saw Dr. Kara Waltz after a back injury in 2008, and I have been under her care on and off ever since. Her warmth and care for you as a person paired with her effective treatments keeps me coming back when I'm in need of a chiropractor. I always feel better when I walk out of her practice having been adjusted by her powerful - yet tender and healing - hands. If you're looking for a chiropractor, Dr. Kara is AMAZING! Stop reading now, and go book an appointment to see for yourself.</review>

Dr Kara is awesome! I had seen other chiropracors before but wasn’t getting relief. A few sessions with her made my whole body feel much better than ever before and I became a very happy, loyal client of hers for years now! ✅</review>

< Review>
I love Kara, and have been going to her for the past 11+ years. She has saved me many times from the neck pain brought on by my athletic adventures. In particular, I love that Kara connects easily with athletes and mothers. I went to Kara through 2 pregnancies. I like the casual community setting of her office which is kid friendly (which is a huge for me as I often bring my kids). I would recommend Kara to anyone!< /Review>

I love it here! Kara is always great at knowing the right adjustments my body needs. She’s also not pushy in trying to sell me more stuff or appointments that I don’t need. She’s candid and also very direct in what’s happening with my treatments and how my body is reacting to it.< /text>

I'm on my fifth visit with Dr. Kara and each time I feel better and better. Dr. Kara's magical healing powers make me feel as if I've shed both emotional *and* physical weight after each adjustment.  She's in tune with my body, is a great listener and truly connects with the problem areas.

Waltz Family Chiropractic is a clean, conveniently located, comfortable and thoughtfully warm office and Kara is one very gifted healer! I would recommend her to family and friends and especially athletes working through old injuries, just like myself.</text>

<review>Kara helped my son, Leif Greening-Hamlin in such a deep and profound way. Leif had bone cancer at age two with severe treatment complications, including an irradiated right shoulder blade and upper arm. At age three he finished treatment but there was so little help for him once he finished medical treatment. Kara provided Leif with care when there was so little to help him heal from all he had gone through. She helped his body in such an amazing way - a tiny body racked by chemo and radiation and distorted and damaged. She took his body in hand holistically and helped him re-inhabit his body, find healing and alignment and range and hope. She is a very good person. She is an extremely skilled practitioner and a healer.</review>< Pics>

I go to Dr. Kara for sports injuries.  An athlete herself, she understands the injuries and how to treat them.  She will help you get back on to the field or the track.<//Review>

<text>I met Kara for the first time about seven years ago through our love for soccer.  I went to her to help me deal with a long term injury on my neck, and lower back, to find she has magic hands!  My neck continues to feel such relief.  She's works on my feet, continues with all of my back, neck,...and I feel so much stronger and healthier due to her healing abilites.  She has a gentle spirit, and cares for myself as well as the rest of my family.  She believes and loves what she does, which is helping bodies align in their natural state of being.
Thank you ALWAYS, Kara!  You have helped the quality of my life improve.

I've seen 5 chiropractors within the span of over 8 years for various reasons.

By far, Kara has been the most thorough in terms of monitoring body placement & educating me during adjustments.

It's been 9 months now since becoming a regular client of Kara Waltz.

She is awesome! Free-spirited, open and from the first day we've built an immediate rapport.

Aside from her technical skill level, she shares several lifestyle tips for overall wellness that I've found helpful for prevention of neck strain, better posture and ease while I work on the computer for several hours daily.

If you're looking for a chiropractor that is on your side and wants to support you in achieving wellness goals, she's a thorough chiropractor and great resource for information.<//Text>

Immediately after I placed myself in Kara's care I noticed a definite difference.  A scapula and neck injury (dating back to almost 7 years ago) that has given me chronic issues now feels as close to normal as I ever could imagine.  The transient pain that felt lodged between my shoulder blades, extending down to the middle of my back and up into the base of my skull is gone!  Kara has been giving me adjustments for little over a month and I am beyond impressed by how great I feel.  In addition to the effectiveness of her techniques, she has a very soft, gentle touch that never feels invasive.  I am a regular patient of Kara's and look forward to continuing with our sessions.  I recommend her without hesitation, ESPECIALLY if you were nervous about being adjusted like I was.</Review>

If I could I’d give it no stars the lady who took my order was super rude and when I got my food they got upset cause I asked for more sauce, I got two big plates and only one sauce. Food was good but the experience made me not want to return<//Review>

The food was delicious. I liked the service. The people were nice and funny, it was very welcoming. It is not very nice looking on the outside or the inside but the food was very good. The prices were affordable but they were not displayed on the menu. It was a convenient place to go and will be returning soon.</text>

The food is great! You get a large serving for a reasonable price. It may not be fancy but it’s a hidden gem. The customer service is great and the restaurant gives you a comfortable feeling . It’s a great place for a family meal or if you want to come to grab something for yourself to go.< /Text>

Local hole in the wall taco spot. Dingy and hot so as along as you order takeout, it isn't too scary. Best french fries in Compton.<//review>

This place is nasty!! I ordered asada fries and ate almost the whole thing with my 12 year old son when we saw a good size roach all sqwooshed into the cheese and beans...we both incredibly started throwing up..I took it back to the restaurant to show the owner and they just handed me back my $8 without a word....must happen alot. DISGUSTED!< /review>

<text>I was craving pupusas and I was in the area and decided to stop by. I ordered the mixed and spinach and they were amazing. The salad water was delicious and had a second cup. For desert I ordered fried plantains and plantains desert with cream. Everything was delicious and I was amazed that this place which was non descriptive could produce such quality food.</text>< userid>

Good pupusas but their other offerings are very expensive. Food takes a long time to prepare.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Come to have breakfast, lunch or lunch at Silvia's pupuseria. Its menu is extensive in a great variety of Central American and Mexican food. What a good seasoning it has. It has Central American drinks and delicious coffee. I will be a regular customer of this restaurant.

<Review>Great place! My lashes were beautiful. I was a little worried because the building is skettish. Once I entered the room, I felt better about the place.  Fair warning: know what you want.  Choices: Amount of lashes: Classic, Hybrid or Volume.  Curl: C-slight curl, D, DD, etc.  Style: Natural, Babydoll, cat-eye.  Length: 12mm, 13mm etc.  My photo is classic, 12 mm, babydoll with D curl.  I might go longer next time, but this is good for me.  Cost $109 with extra $5 for Covid.< /Review>< pics>

I absolutely love having my lashes done here! I’ve been coming consistently for over a year. LashBar Kearny Mesa is always clean, well organized, and well staffed. I highly recommend everyone they have on staff, with my most favorite staffers being Raymie, Jenny, Tran, and Ran!!
Sometimes I am HARD on my lashes (work stress, working out, etc) but these babies last! I have not suffered any damage to my natural lashes or any slowing of growth.
We could all use some “I woke up like this” in our lives. Get your lashes done or gift some lashes!!< /review>

<Text>I had the best experience here and can't wait to come back! I had my lashes done by Tran. She was super helpful in showing me the different styles and lashes to choose from and was so patient with all my questions. I originally booked a classic set and went with the volume after her recommendation and was so happy I did! The lash bar itself is super clean, inviting, and relaxing - so much so that I fell asleep during the set and so it really flew by! Above all, I am soooo happy with my lashes. They are incredibly full, look natural, and are holding up so well even after swimming in the ocean, showering, working out, etc. Such an enjoyable experience and an even better outcome! Thank you Tran!!!<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< time>

<Review>Professional, clean and courteous staff. I get my lashes done my Tran and she is amazing. Knows exactly what looks good on me and you can tell by her work that she takes her time to make sure it comes out well. She doesn’t rush it and really goes lash by lash and makes sure you are satisfied. Worth every penny. The results are just beautiful and I don’t have to worry about putting on make up every morning. I look good day and night thanks to Lashbar! And esp shout out to Tran for being so awesome and sweet!</Review>< Pictures>

So I don't get anything for myself here, but I bring my girl to get her lashes done. Even though I'm not having anything done, I've got to say that the staff is so friendly. They treat my girl very well and are extremely courteous to me while I wait as well. Plus, her lashes always look amazing when she's done. I would recommend this place to everyone. My girl is super pleased with the results and I'm super pleased with the service. Five stars, easily.<//Text>

Customer service was amazing. I called in last minute but still got an appointment at my best convenient time. Tran set me up with some amazing lashes. I've been to a few places already but Lashbar has become my favorite. Lash quality is as important to me as customer experience, and truthfully I'm very impressed.
The salon was beautifully designed with a white fancy theme accommodated by champagne, something very unique to me. Easy parking and convenient location next to freeway are also big pluses. Also, Tran is very friendly as well. She really knows how to make her customer happy and beautiful. I highly recommend!< /review>

For my first time, I got a classic set but wanted my lashes more full so when I went back for my fill, I upgraded my fill to a hybrid set. I got two different stylist each time but they were both really good and made sure I was happy with the results. I also had to book my appointment last minute due to my work scheduling but they were still very happy to help me in a short notice. I will definitely come back.< /text>

I loved the lash service here and Tran was simply amazing. She was patient and listened to what exactly I was looking for. The extensions were reasonably priced and I loved the results. The atmosphere at the salon was pretty unique and comfy . Definitely deserves 5 stars and I would highly recommend the lash extensions !<//Review>

I’m so glad I went to Lashbar Kearny Mesa because they took such great care of me the entire time.

First off Tran is so sweet, and patient in answering any and all questions that you have if it’s your first time getting any of the services offered here. They’ll walk you through the entire process and you’ll definitely leave super happy. I’m absolutely in love with my lashes and I’m so glad I don’t need to wear strip lashes anymore! I will definitely be back consistently to continue getting my lashes done. The quality of care and attention that they give you here is absolutely fantastic.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

When I stepped into LashBar Kearny Mesa I was greeted with warm welcomes. I was given a consultation to see which set would fit me best. It has been a week since I’ve had my lashes done at LashBar and they feel absolutely amazing!! Soft and high quality lashes. I really look forward to my next visit!<//Review>

I’m sooooooooooooo thankful I went to LashBar to get my first set of lashes. Tran did a wonderful job putting on my lashes and patiently explained to me how to care for my lashes. I would highly recommend this place to anyone even with a single thought of getting lashes!  From the beginning to the end of my visit, every step of the process was explained to me and it really assured me that I was in great hands.

Aside from the awesome lashes, I appreciate how clean and beautiful this place was. They really know how to decorate and furnish the place to make me feel relaxed as if I’m at a spa. The personal touches like lychee champagne makes this place so unique too!

Also, shout out to the front desk for putting me in last minute! I saw this place when I was driving on the 163 freeway and searched  it right away. They squeezed me in literally the day after I called.
You guys are all awesome! I’ll for sure be back for my lash refills!😊</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Text>Finally the wait is over, i got to try the burger thousands are raving about making them #7 place to eat in the US. Exciting to say the least! I really wished my opinion would be the same as the thousands that ate here but....
The burgers were NOT life changing. Sure it was good, but so is umami, and in-n-out
I went with the truffle burger which I thought was pretty good, again not the best.
Their cheese fries with some onion jam was delicious though.
Their happy hour was cool, we got the sliders (came out cold) was replaced and still came out cold, the chicken tacos, and the wings. All of this was average stuff you can find everywhere else.
And for finally the long awaited infamous bread pudding. This was good!!!!
Will I return?? probably.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Defined a place to recommend !

I went to the cinch Saloon last night, alone (visiting from France). The decor is great, the bartender was very  welcoming and the general atmosphere was chill and friendly.   I was surprised of how mixed the clientele was for a gay bar, but everyone was friendly, and I had a great time at the Cinch. I’ll be back !</Text></record></dataset><record>

This is the greatest gay bar on Polk Street. Jeremy,  Scott, and Eddie, are the Queens of Polk street. These men are wonderful, fun, kind, and great in every way! Queen Chasity and I send our love! This bar is the place to go on Polk! 6/5.</text>

<review>It's bigger on the inside! The only gay bar left standing on Polk St, The Cinch is a San Francisco treasure. Great beer selections, speedy bartenders, and excellent drink prices. I sometimes forget there's a patio all the way in the back, because I like to sit next to the front by the windows and watch the people walking by. Between the front bar and the back patio is a big room with benches and a pool table. Because The Cinch is a ways from Castro, it's often full of locals of all types who just want to get together after work for a drink and a chat.< /review>< time>

Great remnant of the original Polk Street gay bars!

The first time I came in here, the bartender bought me a drink to welcome me to the Cinch. And that's the homely friendly place this is.

The clientele does skew older, but I don't think I've ever come in here without having an interesting conversation with a number of people. Cute little outside patio that gets good sun in the afternoons, and the beer is cheap (even if the taps don't change very often).

Two pool tables, and there's plenty of seating (bar, small tables, big booths).<//Text>

< review>
Happy hour is a time when your friends are spending quality time with you, basically gossiping, while you stuff your faces with discounted food and drinks. One of my friends sent me a list of the top happy hour restaurants in the LA area from an article, so we can try new places together. This is one of those places, and it is soo worth it! This is in the Los Feliz area with their own parking lot! There is outdoor and indoor seating, and the place is pretty decent size so I doubt you would have to wait for a table or wait for too long.

Two problems with happy hour is the lack of selection, and the time. Most happy hours have a few cocktails, beer, and wine that's served with basically sliders and wings. Their list of happy hour foods is impressive. Yes, they do have the traditional sliders and wings, but also have turkey burger, Mac and cheese, soft pretzels, nachos, tacos, salad, chili hotdog, and churro with ice cream! Yes, they even have dessert on happy hour! Even their cocktail menu was pretty generous, and it did have wine and beer as well. The variety on the menu is very impressive, so there is something for everyone! The second issue with happy hour is the time because most end at 6pm. My friend doesn't even end her work until 6, and by the time we get there then it will be about 6:30. They end their happy hour at a decent time of 7pm! So that gave us enough time to order without feeling rushed.< /review>

<Review>In these days with gentrification in the city I love going back to authentic gay bars in SF. Marlena's is gone but the Cinch still serves the best drinks in town, low key, gay clientele and makes you feel at home. I so hope that they don't sell this place out now with all the changes in the neighborhood. We need to keep our authentic gay bars running. Awesome place for entertainment.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>The Cinch is a great neighborhood gay bar to grab a couple (strong) drinks, munch on free popcorn, or play a quick game of pool. If you're lucky enough to meet a regular ask them about the bar's history for a quick run down on historic Polk and the rise of the Castro. Make sure to find, and of course take a picture with, the lion on the wall opposite of the bar. You'll know what I'm talking about when you get there.< /Text>< Date>

<Review>I usually have a great experience when I visit this bar. I've been going to Cinch for years way back when it was owned by Richard and Mario  and Danny Dibble work there...  but I will say that Halloween night this past October was not such a great experience with a bartender that served me and my friends that night... I'm not sure what his name was but he was a Latin bartender with major attitude. We  ordered a round of drinks, my friend paid with his credit card and decided to leave a cash tip so when he signed the credit card he put 0 in the tip column. After he served our drinks my friends didn't believe me when I told them which one of two beers was a wheat beer so we asked the bartender  and he told us that he shouldn't tell us because we didn't tip him. I then told him that we left him a cash tip right there on the counter which I saw my friend put down a 5 dollar cash tip. I also bartend and always leave other bartenders a tip. It's just proper etiquette. Well, he just totally ignore us and would not answer our question we finished that round of drinks and ask for another. He would not even acknowledge that we were sitting right there in front of him. Finally he looked over at us and said if you leave a tip you might get service. Then once again I told him we left you a tip and he argued with us in front of everyone about not leaving a tip on the receipt because he had both copies and there was nothing under the tip column. We were appalled by his actions and his attitude that night. Finally at that moment a really nice young lady who I guess was a regular customer  noticed that there was some issues going on and asked what was the problem...she knew the bartender and ordered our drinks for us. He then made the drinks and we gave him the money which he snatched  out of my hand and through the $20 into his tip jar did not ring the drinks up or give me my change I thought this was very rude and totally unprofessional. I refuse to go back there anytime he is working. I felt he was way out of line....you don't argue with a customer for not tipping you it is a privilege not a mandatory thing.< /Review><user_name>Raymond Evans< /user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>111451245009620497778<//user><Time>1422684528251</Time><resp>None< /resp></record>

This is a "must see" during each and every visit of mine to San Francisco.  I have been served by the same bartender for 18 years.  Love the pool tables and the "very strong" drinks!<//text>

As you pass though the swinging saloon doors, you find this gay dive bar is big and welcoming. The folks are friendly, they have some great round booths, and there's pinball!</Text>

<Review>I see all these negative reviews about cash only - who cares? Go get cash out! Also hands down best fish tacos ever. Their homemade red salsa is AMAZING.

Also great customer service - we were $.95 short on our order and the gentleman who took our order pulled out a $1 and said don’t worry about it.

Always the best spot to go to for fish tacos - need to try the rest of their menu eventually!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>

<date>1570738093001< /date><Review>The food here was very tasty. The tostada was absolutely wonderful. I also had a wet burrito which I was surprised that came with mole sauce which was sweeter then I’d like, but I’m not a big mole fan. My daughter in law tasted it and she said it was true authentic.  This is kind of hard to find but I definitely will be back. I’m looking forward to trying the fish tacos.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6q9xGettzXw_Sz7EiVKHBmBHp6rL-9gROap_C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxIAl7FLFv-XL4WeEmFYRtxKxT_AxkzZgl9lGS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics></record>

This is one of my favorite places! They are really known for their fish tacos but I think anything you eat there is great. Is a family-owned business and the service is always good.  Don't expect frills, just tasty food!< /review>

Not your typical tacos. I had the chicken tacos. The onion is cooked so it is better to get the tacos with everything and then taking out what you don't like..... makes a world of a difference.< /Text>

Came here and enjoyed a great meal. Carne asada burrito with nachos, beans and rice (#15) and hubby had the 2 fish tacos with nachos, beans and rice (#11). The cashier was super nice and gave us free mini nachos because it was hubby's birthday today. :)

Everything tasted great and we really enjoyed our meal.</review>

<text>If you don't read reviews, at least read this: ORDER THE BURRITO DORADO STLYE!

Probably one of the longest lines you will wait in, but totally worth it. The lines moves fairly quickly and the food is prepared even quicker.< /text>< Rating>

<review>Had the Cali Burrito, it was ok. They claim to have great fish tacos but I didn't try them, however I did see many people come and order them.
I would give it a shot as a taco shop but there might be other options more attract nearby.</review>< resp>

<text>Hands down, the best fish taco you can get in the area. I mean, it is absolutely perfect. Their red taco sauce in the squeeze bottles really compliments it too. I have also had their shredded beef hard tacos and they are delicious as well. The fry the shells fresh and they are not pre made like a lot of places.

Beans & Rice are just so so.

If you only go to this place for the fish tacos alone, it is worth it.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I ask for a Carne Asada burrito and they give me a burrito full of beans sprinkled with carne asada. Watch what you buy here because the amount of carne asada on my burrito was less than the carne asada on a taco.<//text>

The food is not that great and the customer service needs major improvement! I waited for a while for someone to take my order then a cashier looked to where I was walked over to see if I needed help? I told him I've been waiting for a while he just didn't say anything. After I ordered I was looking for napkins and plates to get some salsa but didn't find any I had to ask for everything they didn't have anything accessible for the customer not a good experience.</Text>

<review>After finally finding this place I was very disappointed in the food and overall experience. I ordered the taco and cheese enchilada plate. They charged me extra for carnitas meat...why? It did not indicate it was more on the menu...but that wasn't what upset me. What upset me was that when I got the food my cheese on the enchilada wasn't even melted. It was barely warm on the outside and cold shredded cheese on the inside. The sauce was also a sweet cinnamon tasting sauce. Had the cheese been melted it would have been a decent enchilada. My taco was filled with mainly lettuce, very little meat (which I paid extra for) and lacked flavor. The beans and rice where just mediocre. Nothing to rave about.

The restaurant is small and NOT air conditioned, so it was very hot and humid inside. It is not very clean either. There were flying bugs around the salsa bar that I had to shoe away.

I will not go back here again.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great Mexican food, I ordered a Carne Asada taco, a fish taco and a Carne Asada sope. Being Hispanic myself I am very particular in my flavor of food, and this food has good flavor! Will definitely be going back!</Review>

The best pizza place in Isla Vista. No questions. Cheap, unlimited ingredients for less than $10, quality ingredients, friendly staff, deals happening quite often... Just perfect.< /Review>

I got the garlic knots and got home and realized they didn't give me the sauce. I brought them back and they made me 4 new knots, free of charge.

Excellent customer service and good food.< /text><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>5<//rating>< Date>

I've been to pizza chains like this before, fresh fired, thin crust. In comparison, I found the crust to be a bit too thin/a little too weak to hold stand up to the ingredients, I didn't load this one up too too much. Good quality ingredients, good flavor, nice variety of drink options.</Text>

Fast, tasty, filling food and really good drink options make this place pretty good, but the best part is the people. I went in once and they were out of one of my favorite things, so someone went way into the back of the store to get more for me even though I was content to have something else. 10/10 service.<//review>

<review>Wednesday night. 8pm. Just got off work.  Biked super speed to Blaze, grabbed my pizza, and dashed to my dorm. Literally ran huffing puffing up the stairs. As soon as I opened my Blaze it was like unveiling treasure. The smell and sight overwhelmed my senses. I just about cried. I wolfed that Blaze down so quick I was about to order another one, but I didn't have $15 to complete the minimum delivery order.  None of my friends felt like pitching in, so I was out of luck. One of the best nights I have ever had. Definitely will do this again tomorrow if I get more money.< /review><Name>Kieran Apgar</Name>< resp>

Subway was very popular when it was new in the 80's until consumers realized its was made with cheap, unhealthy  ingredients and was not the sandwich they once thought. Blaze Pizza will follow that exact same path. It's a franchise that uses very low quality ingredients that require no skill to produce and the end result is a cheap pizza. They do not make pizza by hand but rather use a press machine for lack of skill or knowledge in the pizza making process. This is what franchises do. They teach inexperienced operators to produce cheap products while they collect a percentage of your gross sales. The dough does not have a proper fermentation time as they have limited space and time to produce a properly fermented dough ball. The result is a spongy dough that lacks crispness and good flavor.  The toppings do not taste or appear fresh  and would be considered the cheapest toppings that can put on a pizza. Understand that franchise made pizza will always be made with the cheapest ingredients using the least skilled process. Just think Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesar's and soon to be Blaze Pizza. This franchise has no passion for producing a quality pizza but rather a desire to make a quick buck producing another lousy, franchise product.< /text>< pictures>

Such a cute pizza place right in the downtown area of the university. Definitely has a college vibe. Very clean & friendly staff w outdoor seating in front w heaters & umbrellas. There's a parking lot about a block up to park in, but there is also a few spaces on side of building I didn't realize I could park in as well.  Definitely recommend.< /text>

Blaze is one of the few places where you can get your pizza really personalized. They have pretty fresh ingredients so if you have some time on your hands and don't have to rush off anywhere I would say Blaze is a great quality pizza place. It's relatively cheaper than a larger pizza at Woodstocks but the downside is they only offer personalized pizzas so save your leftovers to get your moneys worth! Pretty good costumer service but I wish their hours were open later.< /Review>

The build your own pizza can be absolutely fantastic and all the regular pizza options are tasty. The cheese selection is better than you would expect. The blood orange soda on tap is delightful. All in all a good experience if you're looking for a personal pizza</text>

Nancy the GM and Ricky the cook are always nice people to talk to specially Ricky you can heard him a mile away when he greets the customers. Over all Blaze has been my number one place to go for lunch i enjoy coming twice a week and just have my pizza and a good talk with the employees. Can wait to see what BLAZE is going to bring next on the menu????</Review>< pics>

You can hardly go wrong at one of these places -- it's part of a much larger chain and has a commitment to quality. There's a lot of pizza spots in the area, like Woodstock's or Domino's, but Blaze manages to maintain it's individuality with their custom crafted pizzas and overall freshness. I love the pizzas made here, and it's a great place to go for a good meal.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

It's okay, nothing too special. If you don't like the food you really can only blame yourself because it's a build your own. Reasonably priced.< /review>

The pizza was mediocre, mainly due to the burnt leftover charcoal crumbs that stuck to the bottom of my pizza. They need to clean the pans or something bcs my hands were black from the burnt parts stuck to the pizza (the pizza wasn't burnt tho).<//Review>

Like Subway for pizza. Very fun. Crowded, so you know it is popular. Two kinds of tomato sauce and I tried both. The spicy one was too ranchero-spicy. I like a good zesty Italian sauce but this tasted like Mexican food spice to me. Now I know, and will definitely go back</Text>

This is a very unique pizza joint.  They make the pizza right in front of you.  It's a fun experience.  $5.85 for a one-topping pizza or $7.95 for any toppings.  The pizzas are good, and they have smore pies for dessert.<//review>

<review>I would normally rate this Blaze Pizza a 5, however a recent series of events in my experiences eating there have foced me to change my rating. DUE TO 2 REASONS
1.Incorrecting orders- through misplacement of my pizza
2.Spoiled lemonade- that was not changed or emptied for the safety of customers.

Therefore the 5 star quality has dropped to 2.

Blaze was my favorite place in IV, I hope it will improve in quality, so I can once again give it a 5</review>< Pictures>

Best pizza in IV. And it is fairly priced. The signature pizzas on Woodstocks go for 27 dollars. At blaze it goes for 7 a build your own pizza.< /Text>

They were entirely out of chicken when I was here last. How does that even happen? During a dinnertime rush, no less.

Generally great value (as toppings are endless) and quick turnaround time!< /text>

We make an effort to go through street parking and walk over to pearl's finest teas. The consistency is what's key. We love that it's not overly brewed and bitter but just enough tea taste mixed with milk (Creamer?) and honey.< /review>< Pics>

<text>If you need to get some work done or meet a friend for catch up -ILB is the spot.

The staff have never been crazy friendly here - and their menu (though sprinkled with healthy options) - has never been my favorite - but what Joe and the Juice does have going for it -is a plethora of chairs and tables, outlets to plug in your computer, easy wi-fi (without password), and a low key work environment.

Unlike most spots in the financial district - Joe & the Juice is open till 9 during the weekday - so you can easily grab a tea, juice, or little bite to eat - and just work to your heart's content.

I feel like I'm in New York City - typing away on a hightop table - seeing the bustle of downtown pass by the big windows beside me.

I honestly love this place I thought the lasagna for the special was delicious, the flavor was great and so was the texture. I also liked the lighter take they took on all their entrées the lasagna wasn't super meaty which made it a little more lean and less oily which I thought was amazing and gave it more flavor also the chicken and vegetables were cooked perfectly and were very delicious another healthy option on the menu</review>

<text>I was very angry at how long I had to wait for my milk tea.  First, terrible location cuz there is no parking.  Second there were two people making drinks and I waited ten minutes for my stinking milk tea.  Did they have to go out back to dig up the tea leaves or what?  I will not come back.</text><Response>None< /Response>< user>

Drinks are just awful-disgusting, it's a shame. Boba is hard and old. Bad service, dirty bathroom and dirty place. The one and only star is for been open late. I tried it enough times thinking it was just a one time bad experience, but it was not. They seem like they count how many bobas they give you...

Again disgusting...</Text>

<Review>Rude as hell. The guy didn't let me close the door and it was freezing that night not just that but people smoke outside and the smoke comes in. Actually they don't even blend their drinks that well.. they leave them watery as hell.  Might as well go to the bona place on Vermont and 7th which is only 3 blocks up. Thank me later.< /Review>< Pictures>

For a family owned business this location in particular is very professional. They are very good at what they do and meet all your needs with a wide range of services provided. I will always bring my jewelry and watches to them. Competitive pricing and fast service makes them top notch in my book! Not to mention their interesting pieces they have for sale from estates.  Thank you fast fix!< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I stopped in last minute and was delighted to see they were still open, even at 7:30 pm., when most other watch repair places are closed.  This place happens to be inside the Victorville Mall.  The nice young lady changed my watch battery and cleaned my rings for me, all in 15 minutes.  I would definitely recommend.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-xiIBGJKmqrYbsOgJdGPc7Kk2LTsRbwqN7lDs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

I went in Fast-fix to have my G shock watch battery replaced which cost $45 with 5 year warranty which is great. But I got the watch back the day after and none of the buttons worked on my watch. Returned the watch the same day to see why the buttons have no response. Well, after 3 days they could not figure out why it did not work even had their watch maker Troubleshoot it. Needless to say I will not be be giving then my business in the future.< /review>

However, I, wholeheartedly, believe in supporting small(er) businesses...so I paid the add'l $$. Great work.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Had them resize, reset the sapphire and clean up my 18k YG Sapphire ring.. I am beyond words! They did an extraordinary job indeed. The ladies are all a bunch of sweethearts. Vanessa is an invaluable asset to this establishment, an outright delight and very knowledgeable. I was provided with courtesy and professionalism throughout my experience. I can't wait to acquire another quality piece to bring in. The resizing is perfect, and the ring looks outstanding. Thank you Vanessa, Kirstin and Maricella!

2nd Visit::
Came in once more for cleaning on some hardware. A++ Natalie was awesome, extremely knowledgeable, polite and helpful. I highly recommend Fast-Fix. Thank you.

<Text>I went to Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair. The young lady that assisted me was very knowledgeable about the watches I took in about 6 of them, all different brands and models. Very honest as well, one of my watches had the guarantee battery that I had forgotten about and she did not charge me to replace it; It had been about 3 years ago. The band adjustments were perfect. Prices are reasonable, service is very fast, I dropped them all off at closing saturday night and they were all ready to pick up Saturday morning. I would definitely recommend Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair to all family and friends.< /Text>< Rate>

Took about an hour and a half for them to resize my ring and I’m in a LOVE with how it turned out, the quality is so nice you can’t even tell it was resized. The staff was so nice as well and very professional. I definitely recommend this place if you need any jewelry or watch repairs< /text>

I needed my wedding set resized and soldered together. Although the price tag was a higher than other local jewelers/jewelry repair, the work was completed within 24 hours. Great attention to detail and very good quality work. Definitely worth paying the extra buck when your other options require you to send out your items for weeks at a time!</text>

We've gone to Fast Fix a few times over the years and always had a great experience.  Natalie in your Victorville store is an amazing person. She's patient, knowledgeable, understanding and suggests alternatives or something better when we were unsure of what we wanted. You have a true gem of an employee in Natalie.</Text>

I brought my wedding ring in for a resize and to get a new center head mount. My center diamond was missing two prongs. They completely changed the center mount and resized my ring with great quality. My ring also received a deep cleaning and honestly it looks like a new ring!!!! 🤗 Thank you for everything! We will be back for future jewelry needs!<//review>

Sceptical about taking a family heirloom piece to any jeweler but Natalie the manager seemed to be very knowledgeable so I was able to make appt to sit and watch the jeweler while he re- sized and re tipped the stones also rhodium dipped over the gold, have to say it came out beautiful looks brand new
Thanks fast fix<//text>

I went to this place to get three silver bracelets engraved. They had them ready for me sooner than they had anticipated. And I must say I couldn't be happier. Maricela did a beautiful job with  the engraving and the price was great. I don't remember the name of the lady who took care of me but she had beautiful blue eyes. I want to give her a special thank you for being so sweet.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>First time ever going to this place, I've always walked past. This time however its Christmas time. So I'm looking for something very specific for my wife's gift. I went to every jewelry store in the mall, and some had similar items to what I wanted, but as I was let down by most of the stores. This place was on my way out so I figured what the hell. I went in and marisela was there, (hope she doesn't mind me saying her name) I asked for a charm bracelet and she happily said yes, and they even had all the charms! No other store had this item, not only that but my wife and I lost our dog so I wanted something in remembrance of her and they offer engraving!! This was an absolute must! I can't believe that they were able to do this for me. The perfect gift for her, I saw they're engraving and its amazing. So thank you Mari for your help! I hope this review helps you! Merry Christmas!!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>if you need a piece of jewelry repaired
or looking to buy a new piece this is the place to go. I took in my diamond ring for repair. I messed it up good. I broke it, bent it, lost one of the stones, messed up the prongs, & it needed to be resized. I spoke with Natalie. Super lady. Very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. She quoted me a price for all the extensive work needing done. I was happy with the price. They just about rebuilt my ring. They ripped the prongs, added gold channels, built bridge anchor head, tightened all the stones, replaced the missing stone, resized it and cleaned it. It looked better than when I bought it. I am so very happy I took it there. I'm sure you will be too. Thank you to the staff at Fast-Fix Jewelry and Repair and<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This was a delightful store.  I had been looking to replace a watch that was stolen from me for three years. Walk in to Fast-Fix jewelry and I was seeing anything I liked but the ladies didn't give up they went into a bottom drawer and there it was the perfect watch. Even my grandson said grandma that looks like your old one. Thank you ladies I'm very happy with my purchase<//text>

I was nervous about taking my diamond wedding rings to get sized soldered and rhodium dipped, but i took a chance being that in the past i received good service on a watch and had read many good reviews .. I was told my rings would be done in 2 hours which only end up being like 1 hour so i was pretty excited.. on my way home I realized one of the diamonds on the side of my engagement ring was cracked in half and appeared to be glued together and re set back into my setting.. i was furious and immediately drove back to the mall.. Once I got back to the store i showed the employee (Maricella)my ring.. she showed the jeweler and said they’d fix it, i wanted a refund, and asked why i wasn’t notified that a diamond cracked in the process of my repairs and how would I know the quality of stone they were replacing it with?Mind you my ring is over 10k.. she told me she would test the replacement diamond with some handheld device she had..I told her this was totally unacceptable and wanted to speak to a manager and a refund of the $188 i just spent ,she told me no way could she do that and I could only get the defects fixed, and that their was no manager available ..I asked for corporate number and was told the only way to reach the corporate was office was by email..I end up finding a corporate number and left a message with a woman named joann or joanna...This is now day 5 and I still have not got a return call from anyone .. Please be smarter than i was and never take your valuable jewelry to this place! I have insurance on my rings through the store my husband purchased them at but didn’t want to wait the time(2-3weeks)that it takes for the store to send out my jewelry for sizing, soldering and rhodium dip, so i came here as a quick and easy solution...wrong decision ! Go elsewhere and make sure you insure your jewelry and use the insurance, never trust Fast-Fix in Victorville< /Text>

They took my beloved old watch that had been dead for 2 years and they popped a fresh new battery inside that bad boy. It works great and it was fairly priced. I love this place and the people that work there. After resurrecting my watch, I wouldn’t be able to just see them as a watch repair business, I’d consider them healers. Would recommend< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Brought my Nixon watch in today and I knew it needed to be drilled out and was informed that it would take a day until the guy who could do it came in. A little over an hour later and I received a text to let me know it was done already.

Turns out the tech there was able to pick out the part that I was originally told would need to be drilled. Both employees are both super nice and informative and highly skilled.

Will return for all my watch and jewelry needs.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

They were able to engrave my bracelet within an hour. The girl that helped me out was very helpful. The other one said two days but the girl hat helped me did it herself. Their machine scratched part of my bracelet that got engraved in the back but it think it was just a simple mistake.</review>

They where very nice people but their prices for simple things are way to over priced. I done need a 5 year warranty for a simple watch battery. That alone costed me 44$ and to get a link placed back on my watch they charged me another 30$  To get those simple things done should not have costed me 75$< /Text>

<review>I absolutely recommend Fast-Fix! I purchased the lifetime battery plan from them which was so much cheaper than taking it to the original jewelry store I had purchased the watch from. They fixed my watch within 30 minutes and even cleaned it. I will definitely be using Fast-Fix for all my watch and jewelry repairs in the future.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>I carried a wedding ring in to Fast-Fix Jewelry that was overdue for cleaning and polishing. Before the end of the day, it looked brand new. The service was prompt and the representatives were friendly and knowledgeable about their products and their services, particularly regarding diamond rings. Their estimate for services was reasonable. I have no problem recommending them to others in need of the services they provide, also if you are in the market for some jewelry.< /Text><rating>5< /rating><user_name>Melvin Gunn</user_name>< user_id>

they did a wonderful job resizing my ring. it was a little more expensive than I anticipated just because of the reviews I saw, but worth it. so glad i can wear my wedding ring again. I paid just over $100 to get it downsized 1 size. very happy with it<//Review>

These guys did a great job!  Customer service Was excellent!  They replaced the battery in my watch within 15 minutes.  The only issue I had was, they didn't have a replacement band that would work with my watch.  That could be that the watch is very nice bit also about 10 years old.</text>

****NEW REVIEW MAY 7,2021****
Went to their store to resize the diamond ring my mother gave me and was greeted by the store owner. She was just lovely. Very kind and incredibly knowledgeable on her diamonds. Took the time to explain diamonds and to evaluate my moms ring and give me a ton of information. I had to size my ring up 2 sizes and her pricing is great, very fair for the work they had to do. I couldn’t do it that day but she made me an appointment for Friday. I went back on Friday a little late due to personal business stuff BUT again was greeted my the store owner and although they were really busy for Mother’s Day weekend, she was super sweet and remembered me right away and was excited to help me with my ring. The sizing took less than an hour, I could watch the jeweler from the other side of their plexiglass and they polished and cleaned my 1.3 carat diamond ring when they were done. Fast fix jewelry store was fantastic! My ring looks beautiful and seamless. The customer service is top notch. I will always go there when I need work done on my jewelry AND they sell a lot of beautiful pieces as well as estate jewelry.</text>< pictures>

Vanessa was the best associate I’ve dealt with. She was very patient and knowledgeable and she didn’t try to push a sale. She took her time explaining what i needed, when I came back to pick up my wife’s ring came out looking like new. I would highly recommend going here and speak with Vanessa!</review>

I’ve been going to Fast-Fix for years and their service is fast, affordable, and by far the best quality service I’ve ever had! I won’t trust anyone else with my watches and jewelry. Thank you Fast-Fix!!<//Text>

<review>Whenever I need any repairs done on my jewelry I always use fast fix at the VICTOR Valley Mall because of their knowledge and expertise in the items that they are handling. Today a young lady by the name of Vanessa was who helped me out she was very polite, and very helpful. I have come to see that nowadays customer service is not what it used to be back in the days but I want to thank Vanessa for helping me out with exactly what I needed and providing excellent customer service. Thank you!</review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Resp>

< Review>
It would have been nice for a  suggestion to other need repairs at the time rather coming back to have something else on the same item repaired. Wow, now,  I’m thinking they are not proud of their ability or perhaps they only see what needs to be done as requested. No in-sites mentioned to repairs that may be needed in the short future.  That’s why we all go to a professional, we  hope one repair will not lead to another. I’d rather pay upfront for possible failures in my jewelry now..... then taking two or three trips in the future. This is why I gave two stars. Other than that,  the work that you did for me was terrific.   I’d rather know at the moment if something else will or may fail. Again, I’d rather pay now for intuition by a professional to fix or secure items now rather loose what is presious and /or make several trips later to have them fixed.<//Review>

I went in to have my wedding rings sauntered together as I have been wanting to do this for years but I was uncomfortable to leave them with any jeweler over night. They fixed my rings within an hour as I waited. He did an amazing and beautiful job on my rings. I never imagined they would look this good. They also cleaned them. My husband agreed on the workmanship they did. They have great and friendly customer service. I would 100% recommend them for the work they did for me. Sincerely, Barbara Michals<//Text>

This is my go-to jewelry place now. They get simple fixes done within minutes which hardly gives time to shop at the mall (that's a good thing! Lol) They're always nice and knowledgeable and they have a nice array of jewelry. My whole family goes here.<//Text>

I didn't remember I had a warranty on my watch battery, but they found I had one and let me know when it expires, so they are very honest. I highly recommend this place, they are all awesome! I took my watch in on a Sunday morning and I did not get the name of the young lady who waited on me, but she did a fantastic job and was very courteous, an attribute more shops in the mall need.< /review>< pictures>

Sent my watch in to get the crystal replaced. The Citizen watch was working perfectly fine before hand and when I got it back two weeks later, the watch doesn’t keep time anymore, the tachymeter doesn’t work, there was lint/particle inside the watch. It’s best to  avoid this place unless you want to waste your money.< /text>

She even went out of her way and asked if I needed it set to a certain time zone. Which was a brilliant idea since it was going to someone in Florida and figuring it out on these watches when you just got it can be a pain but she took care of it. She told me what time it’s be ready because they were working on something else and I came back a little early and to my surprise it was already done. Always have to be thankful for timely service lol no pun intended.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My name is Jeannette, and needed. My precious necklace fixed which was from my daughter. They fixed the chain for me as a courtesy.  They also do free cleaning of your Jewelry. They are very polite and couteous to their customers. I am getting my watch fixed through them. Their prices are good and they give free estimates. Go see them in the Victor Valley Mall.
I am recommending fast fix to all my family and friends.</Text>

Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair are fantastic! They take care of all my Jewelry needs. They have great service with quality and fast repairs. They were able to adjust my wedding band and wrap to sit better for a more complete look.  I take all of my watches for cleaning and repairs here. Today I left them a vintage pair of earrings to repair and clean. While you wait they clean your rings for free! The prices are very reasonable and the warranty is worth the additional cost. The store manager Sounique took her time to understand my needs and offer feedback and solutions.
If you need cleaning or repair work, check out Fast-Fix. You can have lunch at Red Robin while you wait.< /Text>

Everything is a positive for this place, had one Mavado watch that stopped working they said it needed a new movement, Two weeks afterwards that replacement movement needed to be replaced as well. No reflection on them only on Movado.Couple weeks later I took a Bulova Acutron chronograph to be reset, but unfortunately it to need a new movement. Prices are reasonable, friendly staff all went well</review>

Veronica was great! I came in to have a couple of links taken out of the watch band. It was less than $20 and she said she could do it in less than 20 minutes! I walked around the mall a bit and came back. She was finished, but the band was still a little loose. She took out more links and then it was too tight. She put one back in and it was a perfect fit! I appreciated that she did not give up until I was satisfied.< /text>

Went in to have a necklace repaired the lady's there welcomed me and asked how they could help me. I explaining what had brought me there . One of them went on to tell me that they could repair it and how much it would cost me and the length of time it would take. All in general it was a very satisfying and pleasant experience .I recommend this place to anybody who needs jewelry or watches repaired.< /text>

I came into the store on a Saturday afternoon to fix my necklace and they didn’t have a jeweler available to properly fix my jewelry.  They should always have a jeweler on site on a Saturday afternoon of all days.</Text>

<text>So I’ve been looking for a good place to clean my rings and none of the stores up here in the HD are good, so I decided to try this place and the very beautiful young lady helped me with my rings, she was very sweet, and nice and very helpful. It all took like 10 minutes for like 5 rings and they came out stunning ! So clean and nice, even the young lady was like “wow they came out shinny”. All and all she was a great help, and had excellent customer service! Highly recommend this place for ring cleaning, watch fixing, and purchasing jewelry definitely coming back!!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

As of this date 12/30/19 they came apart at the same place they were fixed. Fast fix said because it is passed the 30days by 7 days I will be charged again. I won’t recommend this store to my worst enemy.. Beware another bad business in the high desert.< /Text>< pics>

It wonderful to walk into a place that not only lives up to it's name but you can trust and the prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.  I had a gemstone reset in my ring and they did a wonderful job.  Before the ring I brought in my boyfriend's watch for a battery.  They take great care when handling your items and explain everything to you beforehand.  Highly highly recommend this place.<//Review>< pictures>

I needed a new battery for my watch. The person at the counter was very courteous. I got a new battery, a warranty and they even cleaned my watch for free.  I definitely would recommend this place.<//Text>

<text>Had several opal rings over the years that have broken or needed  sizing . Went to your store . Natalie was  helpful , gave me pricing on each one ,but no pressure to do it .She even put in writing her proposal for each ring and the cost. I am retired on a fixed income but today I was able to take two rings to be repaired. thank you for your kindness and your understanding and your expertise. I am GIA certified myself, these people know what they're doing and they're honest!< /text>< Time>

5 stars for Natalie one of the nicest,Kindest  exceptional person working for Fast Fix! Even with the line growing behind me she still took the time to explain everything she was going to do to fix my watches. And make sure we agreed on everything before she worked on them. Fast fix is the only place I’m going to go to get work done. Thank you Natalie for taking the time to explain everything to this old man... J.C.</Text>

I needed a battery replacement and I thought I would try Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair.  I was amazed at their quickness in replacing my watches battery, and I was totally gratified to get their offer of 5 years battery coverage for $24.95.  Batteries normally need replacing every year, that means I will only be paying $5.00 for each battery.< /review>

On Sunday I walked in to get a battery replacement for my Bulova water resistant watch, an engraved gift from my employer for 10 year's. The taller young girl told me it would be $19.99, or if I wanted a 5 year warranty on the battery it would be $24.99. First, $20.00 is too much to pay for a 'maybe' $5.00 battery to be replaced but wanted a "professional" so they would know how to take off the back without scratching. She told me it would be 15-20 minutes. We left at 11:53 and returned at 12:30. The first girl appeared to walk back to the "workbench" where my watch was, fiddled with it a bit, then walked to me to explain the back needed to be put on. Then she asked the dark-haired, shorter, girl to assist. That girl finished my watch, came up to the counter, handed it to me. I noticed the inscription on the back was crooked and I made a comment. She said "well when we put on the backs we just put them on". I said, "but that's not how you received the watch". She said "I can redo it!" and me thinking time said "never mind". Then I also noticed back was also on upside down and I asked her to put the back on right, the way it was when I brought it in. She took the watch and while walking back to "workbench" said "I told you I would do it!" I reprimanded her stating "No. 1 rule is' the customer is always right!'
Now back to the pricing. The first girl explained $24.99 is 5 year guarantee, 2nd girl explained $24.99 for 5 year's and replace battery 1 time each year. Two different explanations concerning 5 year benefit. Bad service and my husband will learn to take back off before I pay minimum wage girl/employee to do again.<//review>

<Review>The girls there were great. Very helpful and courteous. They replaced the batteries on my watch and my brother's in less than a half hour. And they were both under warranty. So it was a good experience overall.</Review>< response>

<review>I felt their customer service was not welcoming, I felt the person that assisted me had an attitude upon helping me. I know they experience a lot of riffraff in that area but you should never judge a paying customer based upon other situations you have delt with in the past. Furthermore I had the battery replaced in my gold plated Nixon time teller watch, that holds sentimental value to me, a gift from my children for fathers day. A watch that I've only worn a handful of times since I received it, usually it sit in my closet in it original box. The watch was in great condition when I took it in to have the battery replaced, this is the first time I have ever had the battery replaced. My miatake I left the store without looking the watch over trusting their work and to my surprise the battery cover plate was scratched and chipped in multiple areas removing the gold plating. They had me purchase a 5 yr warranty but I will never step foot in that place again. Anyone doing business with them I hope you have better luck than me.< /review>< Pictures>

Way way over priced!!!! They wanted to charge me $250 to have the setting on my wedding ring reattached. I went to another place and had the same work done for $65 with a guarantee. To other customers please look around for a better quote.</review>

I went in on 12/14/18 to get the battery on my watch replaced and the ladies were very nice. I was told the wait would be 20 minutes and it was replaced in about 15 minutes. I liked that quick service. Thanks again.</Text>

I had a watch engraved here for an anniversary gift. They were super fast and very helpful through the design process. The only snag was that the engraving was incorrect. Nothing major! It just was not quite the design I'd asked for, so it looked less streamlined than desired. Would still absolutely recommend!< /Text>

Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair stepped up to the plate when no one else could.
Other businesses told me I’d have to wait a week for a battery replacement and that they would have to send it out.
Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair fixed my watch on the spot with no wasted time. Excellent customer service, very polite and knowledgeable. I got my watch sooner then the estimated time it would take. (Big + for me with a busy life style.)
I differently would recommend Fast-Fix Jewelry and Watch Repair if your looking for a fast reliable service. I will be back for all my future watch needs.

Thx!

They fixed my bracelet and neckless. All seems good. And the lady was very nice.
But I haven't worn neckless yet. to make sure it does brake again.
I needed to have my sterling silver rings re-gold dipped. But she said it was $89 per ring. Which I was told by other jewelers it would be about $25-$30. So $89 was extremely high I thought and said no.< /text>

Simple battery change. 15 bucks on a higher end watch. In and out with no damage and they reset the time and date for you... cant ask for much more for 15 bucks.</text>

<Review>They didn’t know what for sure to charge. Didn’t give me my military discount and the toggle job was sub par. A nick in it as well as not being smooth on the inside.<//Review>< pics>

I was here to switch my watch's battery. They provided outstanding service in a timely manner. PS: One of the buttons on my watch wasn't working after the battery replacement. I went back to the store and they quickly fixed my watch for me, hassle free! I highly recommend this location.< /review>

<Text>Great customer service, they’re fast and work clean ! I took my Michael Kors smart watch to them to have it fitted and they were very fast in removing the links , most jewelry merchants would not remove links and fit my watch for me ! When I got my watch back they had it wrapped in tissue paper and it had been polished up the screen was clean as if the wiped it down with a polishing cloth , very satisfied which the service provided .<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Customer service was exceptable and they fixed my wife's broken glasses. Far to expensive though for the fix that was done. The right arm of the glasses frame was soldered together fixing the problem but at $59.95? Seems a bit steep. Granted new glasses could cost 5 times as much but, for the work done the price was high. What are you going to do though?</Text><Name>Michael Haston< /Name><UserId.>110678808565928053176</UserId.><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><rating>3< /rating><Time>1541815430452<//Time></record>

<Review>This is the best little jewelry/watch-fix place. I take my watch there every time my battery goes out, and they leave a note inside the watch as to when it was last placed so that if it goes out before the warranty, they put a new one in at no cost to me.< /Review><Time>1534989790171< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Work is done professionally and at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, repair people are not always there and customers may have to wait for estimates on work.</Review>

< Review>
My 16 yr old Omega watch stopped working. Repair time was between 2 and 3 weeks.
Cost was $ 395.00 which seemed very high.
Warranty is one year.< /Review>

<Text>An unscrupulous woman massed up my expensive watch and told me that she didn't  do it. Also when I asked her the price of changing the battery she looked at my watch and said 99.99 (ninety nine dollar and ninety nine cent). I complaint about the  price is too  high then she said 39.99. How can I trust this kind of store and employees!<//Text>< Pictures>
