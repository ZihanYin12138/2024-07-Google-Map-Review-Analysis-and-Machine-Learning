<pics>None< /pics><Text>I really hate leaving a bad review, especially when businesses are struggling, but our experience warranted this. We probably should have known to walk away when our drinks came. I requested iced tea with sweetener, what I was presented with was a container holding about 10 packages, all stained and old. Giving the benefit of doubt, I emptied the content of an equal packet into my drink and it was Orange and chunky. We tried several of the packages, but all were spoiled. I requested a different beverage and let it go. I figured it was a pandemic thing.

Then there is the service…once our order was taken, we literally never saw the server again. Our appetizer never came. My husband’s food came out first and since it was a hot item, I encouraged him to eat. He was done and we still had to wait quite a while for my food to come out. The food itself was subpar. Considering what we ordered, or at least what we got, it wasn’t worth the price.

We ultimately had to flag someone down to get our bill and left so unsatisfied that we walked up the street and had a couple slices of pizza.

Ultimately, they have a lot of work to do, but when it comes to sushi, we won’t be chancing it again. Our digestive systems already paid the price once.< /Text><user_name>Mrs. Suzanne Carter, MBA</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Yesterday was our first time we visited this good restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the courteous service, with the great  dishes and booze and with the honest cost. We will definitely come back again.<//text>

<Review>Such a warm welcome experience with amazing food. Staff was very helpful and always ready to take any special requests. They made special sushi for us. Definitely will be returning to this place. Very small and very homemade very good. Definitely a must go to place. Really good sushi high-quality. Sashimi was fantastic. Service was even better. Classic Japanese style very fun. If you're in town definitely check it out, a cute quiet little place that does food right.  The sushi bar selection is good and the beer selections even better</Review>< Resp>

Simple, quick, cheap, fresh and I always feel satisfied and healthy afterwards.  That's why I often consider it in my lunch options.  It's not too expensive, and the food is really good for a quick experience like it is.  It's a somewhat unique experience sitting at a bartop and getting the rolls made right in front of you, one by one as they come out.  I'd also recommend the sake cup, it really compliments the meal.<//Text>

<Review>I keep returning and don't tend to put the time to share my opinion on experiences with restaurants but this place deserves it. I tend to be picky when it comes to sushi. This place is really good. Service, food, staff, chefs, cleanliness. On birthdays the restaurant does this neat little light show with their bulbs and follows the rhythm of the music playing. If you ask for spicy and crunchy they do not mess around. Dessert is delicious. This place doesn't disappoint.<//Review>< Response>

Oh my good gosh damn the El nino roll.  Without question the single best roll I've ever eaten.  The rest of what I tried there was pretty average, but I am going to have dreams about the El nino roll.  If I find two other rolls that I really love there this will be my favorite sushi place in the area and I will change my review to five stars.<//Text>

First time here. Service was horrible. We weren't greeted. Stood around and finally sat down at sushi bar even though it needed to be cleaned. We waited and waited. I got up to get a menu. We weren't even offered drinks. We finally, asked for drinks. They didn't come. Had to ask again. A bus boy came and cleaned but didn't give us are utensils...  Chop sticks, napkins ...
Waitress finally acknowledged us. We were very patient for they had a large party and others and ONE waitress! I felt bad for her. It's not her fault.
Sushi bar chef was solo as well and swamped. He finally took our order after we remembered we had to fill the order chart out which I went searching for and found on bar! We ordered food came and it was FANTASTIC!  The good news!
Sushi chef was very pleasant.
But service sucked that night.
After the large group left I mentioned to waitress and cheft did someone call out sick? She was working hard. No, she was on her own her second week! The whole restaurant!
They locked the doors for it was closed and we were still eating. They cleaned around up around us. We sat for it seemed like forever to get the bill. We had to ask a few times. It was awkward.
Food was great. Service was lacking.<//text>

Rolls are great but we all know that the real sushi is served at the bar on behalf of the working chef .... Get with the program</review>

Hesitant to try this place again.  Went with my wife for some sushi and upon my first bite I received a nice bone right through the gum behindmy tooth.  Not cool at all.  Let them know and showed them and got a nice little smile and a very slight head bow.  Give me a break, in a sushi place I get a bone.  No remake on the sushi and no comp if anykind on the bill.  Lets just say I will not be going back.  Mahé is better quality and Sushi Ryokan is good as well.</Text>

<review>I’ve given this place a chance a few times only because it’s convenient, right by my house and not that expensive but every time I’m disappointed. They leave your nails really bumpy and they come off right away. Plus if you give them special instructions and they are not familiar with them, they give you a bad attitude and make the whole session so uncomfortable. Really bad customer service. Not recommended.</review>< Gmap_id>

This place sucks. I told them I wanted a white tip she painted a pinkish color. So since she insisted I let her. As soon as I got home two of the nails were already peeling off. Plus she kept like almost 10 dollars in tip. I will never ever go back to that nasty place.< /review>

< Review>
I guess you can judge a book by its over. Came here wanting a manicure  pedicure with gel on my fingernails . So first off the cut my cuticle and I started bleeding and she was trying to justify it by saying she had to because it needed to be cut. Then the pedicure was so fast and I asked for a calleous remover and she completely skipped giving me a sea salt scrub and massage that is suppose to come with every nail service. From there I had a nail that I told her needed to be fixed and she insisted on pulling it off. Cutting it low. I told her NO thank you I would like to keep the length of the nail and told her how this other nail salon saved my nail. She decided to use super glue which helped a little to fix the nail but then she skipped the manicure part which is to massage my arms. I was also shocked to see they had at most 20 nail colors for the gel. And when she tried taking of the previous nail color I had one she used an electric nail filer. Ugh I hurt so bad. She completely thinned down my nail. It's safe to say I will not be coming back here again. I gave it two stars because she finally did listen to me about my broken nail and she had one gel color I thought was ok. But other than that. you can't understand them and they get mad when you try and tell them what you want.</Review>

I went in sunday and the lady dipped in the nail acetone/alcohol idk. Then she put glue on my nail n put on the wet nail on; three days later they are lifting up.i went in today and it cant be fixed by anyone because if they fix it they arent going to get paid for the work because manager said she isnt going to pay for it. If it was done right i wouldnt be with fkn nails trying to pop up. So dont waste your money.< /Review>

They do the nail shape pretty bad they leave part of your real nail showing. They paint your nails but they paint your cuticles too. Those aren't my nails dude.</review>

They are very unsanitary I had a pedi done there they didn't remove my nail polish completely instead she used a nail filer to remove the gel she soaked my feet into cold water while cutting my nails she cut a piece of skin layer put alcohol to stop bleeding which helped the next day my foot was itchy I went and bought athletic foot spray because I was scared to catch fungus very disscusting place..<//review>

<Review>The worst place ever, they get you as new member in a low fee without explaining the hidden fees and the year contract you signed without reading it, because of their excuse to send it by mail.

It gets a bit packed so hard to use machines. They also don't say on their site about a $49 fee after 60 days and $49 fee on January 25 every year until you are signing up for there membership.. But other than that it a good place to work out<//review>

I’ve been here for 6 years and I couldn’t ask for a better gym experience since 2015. I’ve met friends here and I hope to continue my journey as an adult!</review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1613111986422<//time><user_name>Memo Perez</user_name><Text>I've enjoyed this gym, I've been coming here for years with USA Fitness and its prior accomodating earlier hours, however, the new hours are not as accomodating for the early people such as myself. I really wish they opened at 6:00 AM or at least 6:30 AM. Its impossible to go in the morning because they open at 7:00 AM for many of us that work. It is also impossible to go in the evening because its extremley crowded and if you have a routine, its impossible to keep it since you'll be waiting for a particular machine.

On behalf of other loyal customers, Ive reached out a few times requesting to open a little earlier during the week. I was told in December they would accomodate the request this past January, which never happened and I felt I was lied to.

I believe opening a little earlier may benefit this gym by minimizing the over crowding in the evening and/or bringing in more customers who are only able to work out in the morning.

Not sure if anyone will read this, or, for that matter, probably even care. We're just requesting to open a little earlier during the week.< /Text>< user>

Their flower bouquets are hand-delivered all over the place by their professional delivery man. They make certain that your loved ones receive a fresh flower bouquet customized with your message and touch. They are constantly studying and improving their methods in order to provide you with better service.< /Review>

The flowers were absolutely stunning and perfect! We appreciated the option of same-day delivery, and we were moved by the thoughtfulness with which our friend was treated when the flowers were delivered. I would definitely recommend the flower shop to all of my colleagues. Thank you once more!<//review>

I'd like to give a quick update - I was contacted by Natalia and she quickly offered an explanation and was more then happy to replace the flowers.  I appreciated the quick response to my issue. I am absolutely going to use them again based on their wonderful customer service and as I said before the roses looked great!!!</Text>

Andrei, as we agreed on, I am leaving a review here if I was satisfied with the flowers, and I was definitely happy with them.  The roses were beautiful, and my boyfriend loved them!  The arrangement looked really nice, too.  You made both of our days.  Thanks for your help, and I'll be sure to return the vase =) .<//text>

You must be known by many! Last Monday, I gave my mother a bouquet of roses, and she was so happy with it. I couldn't give her that kind of gift without this wonderful flower shop. I like the flowers because it was all fresh. I thanked Victoria for arranging it nicely. Huge thanks to all of you! Highly recommended!</text>

Great florist! I found them online within my daughters same new zipcode and found the perfect succulent arrangement for her taste on their website. I ordered this on her moving and birthday weekend and they delivered it to her the same day! Great service and not only did I receive an order confirmation and delivery confirmation, but a snapshot of the actual arrangement that they delivered. She loves it! Thank you to Darlings for being able to surprise her on the weekend since I couldn't be there!</review>

This is a long overdue review! Darling's Holm & Olson Florist did an AH-MAZING job for flowers for our wedding in April. They were beautiful, especially the arrangement for the arch. I remember during the ceremony looking up at the archway piece and thinking "worth every penny". It was stunning.<//Text>

I was in at the same time as reviewer John Munoz (Villanueva). We walked in at the same exact time on Valentine's Day morning, yesterday. This florist is very busy for good reason. Luis, half of the husband-wife duo running the show, explained that on Valentine's Day, walk-in orders are not feasible unless you are willing to wait. He reasoned that there were over a hundred orders ahead of us and it would not be fair to everyone who already ordered and paid weeks or even months in advance. This guy was not happy with this info and stormed off in a big huff. How can you review a business if you haven't even been a customer before? I know they would never turn away a potential customer on any other day. His review, which fails to mention critical details, should not even be posted up as it is in no way accurate for this business.

Anyway, I was happy to wait. There is a reason Darling's Holm & Olson is so busy. Aida always has the best arrangement designs and freshest flowers, and the locals (and plenty not-so-local) know it. My family and friends have been customers for at least 20 years and probably more. Hands down this is the only florist worth visiting in Los Angeles. Any other day I know I can expect to walk in here and within 15 minutes, have the most fragrant, freshest flowers filling my car with their enticing aroma. I don't know how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars!<//review>

<review>Lovely green space designed more like a green house than typical plant shop.  Many assortment of indoor plant varieties and succulents.  Easy to be inspired to add a few to the collection at home.  I got potted soil and cactus soil and a couple of plants and everything was very reasonably priced.<//review>< Pictures>

Very pleased with my purchase. Bought the orchids for my moms birthday and she loved it. Was happy that I could purchase them from where I live on the East Coast and she was able to receive them where she is in Los Angles. They sent me email updates as well as a picture of the arrangement of flowers she was getting. Will purchase again. Thank you<//Text>

<review>Best florist EVER!! I've been a loyal customer for well over 25 years.  Their flowers are super fresh and arrangements are thoughtful and artistic.  Every time the "WOW" factor is present when arrangements are delivered.

There are not enough keys on my computer keyboard to say all the good things that can be said about Darling's!!  True caring and professional super stars!

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Otis is a great alternative to Art Center. It's a friendlier environment and the student body is suited to for students coming from high school and community college. The new addition to the campus is really going to change the environment and make it even more communal because they are now going to offer on camps dorms. The education is awesome and like anything you need to work hard to receive the full benefits.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I went to Otis College right after moving to La I already had studded design but wanted to update myself to be up to the American local Standard Market in portfolio and software that is trending because this is obviously what design is all about here. I wasn't very familiar with the system how's your register and I thought that if I take the same class initially as none credit since I'm not enrolled in a program I would still get the exact benefit or that I could enroll in the entire certificate program or continue for a Bachelor of Science in some subject that I end up choosing. unfortunately after completing 7 classes as a non credit I go back to enroll in the illustrator program thinking I only have a few units left to surprisingly find out and without even being previously told that all the thousands of dollars I spent didn't mean anything because it is all non-credit they don't even have grades for me and they don't follow up on it. and that there was no way for them to grade it not refund me not even consider them as units. having taking class in the past and now 6 or 7 I will not go back to studying the same subject that's insane it was very devastating and I think it was very cunning because why would you charge me a hundred less or 200 without advising me and just having me enroll in an evening program while if you are in the same program paying a bit more you will be taken to a different class and treated differently to be prepared for the course I still need clarification on that. nonetheless I did benefits from the school I like that the teachers are in the business so they teach you the master of trade instead of an instructor who only teaches because he couldn't make it in the field that makes a big difference to teach you how to utilize it tool is way different than teaching you how to think of creating the design and concept. I really like the teachers there, but probably since it was a non-credit program they never bothered to finish the curriculum as intended although they did offer to finish it via email after that because the classes are short. I do love the feel and theme of the college it's very hip and modern, I wish they had a good counseling system where students who is new to town would know what they're doing.< /review>

<response>None</response><text>My oldest child took one of their courses for high school students thinking about going to art school. What a waste of $300. The teacher was a scatterbrained mess. One minute she would be ranting about her reading glasses, the next she would lose her train of thought while attempting to teach the kids something new. My child learned nothing in this class. The teacher only gave them suggestions of things to draw but told them that she “ didn’t care if they finish it” or “ if you come to class”. Wait. What?!?!  My teen sat in the classroom with other teens doing basically what she does with her friends , sitting around a table , drawing and chatting. Ugh.</text>< Rating>

Why would you host a fashion show that took up all the parking during finals week? Any other week would have been fine but they did it during finals when students already have enough on there plate and cant afford to miss there final. Sending out a last minute email to warn students about the very limited parking and recommending them to take ubers is not a viable alternative to students on a budget who cant afford a $30+ Uber ride.</review>

<Review>Expensive art school that is here to give people who dont have the eye the eye. Artist aren't fully encouraged to do things in mediums desired. You dont have access to art facilities or supplies as they orginally state. That said you could learn a lot and receive opportunities for the name.</Review>< date>

Got there close to closing time, they were friendly and did not rush us. It's a family owned business, if you are into supporting local businesses and like Indian food like we do please give them a try.

We started with 2 appetizers that complimented each other: fried veggies ( Gobhi Pakora) and a cauliflower dish ( Manchurian Gobhi). The sauce for the cauliflower dish was excellent and I dipped the fried veggies in it, it was superb!!

For the main dish we ordered the chefs choice lamb and the shrimp tanduri. Both were very good. Combine that with excellent hospitality and you have a winning combination for mod week lunch experience.

Will definitely come back with the greater family. I just hope these guys can survive the Covid outbreak.< /Review>

Delicious! Great service. Got the chicken tikka masala plate with yellow daal and garlic naan. The naan was just ok and thin, but overall good meal. Ordered medium spice.</text>

Well we finally found a great Indian Restaurant, and it's near home in Rancho Bernardo! Super nice gentleman on the phone and at the desk. We started with Aloo Samosa..perfectly stuffed and fried with excellent dipping chutneys. Our main courses were Chicken Tikka Masala...perfect from taste to heat and Lamb Rogan Josh was perfect as well with very tender lamb. Delicious Naan and a small aromatic Rice Pudding so good with cardamom. Coming from New York, we're quite spoiled when it comes to ethnic restaurants, San Diego has quite often been a let down, especially Indian food. If you love Indian Food, look no further. If you have a desire to try it for the first time, THIS IS THE PLACE!! Thank You Sher E Punjab!!<//Text>

I love finally trying restaurants that I deliver for, the ones I choose have great staff who attend to their at home diners with as much consideration as their in house customers. I’m so happy to be able to recommend this restaurant, as I enjoy the service I get when I pick up there. The food is great! For four people we got 2 starters, bhaji and samosas, 2 entrees, which come with rice,and naan. It was perfect! I ordered lowish spice level, since eating with wimps,even though I usually enjoy a lil more kick. It was still plenty flavorful, and everyone enjoyed everything. The owner is awesome and you should check it out.</Text>

In years of travel, this is one of the best Indian restaurants I’ve found anywhere. Given the home style cooking, dishes can vary substantially week to week, but I’ve tried nearly the entire menu at this point and have enjoyed it all.
Family and friends have become regular customers.<//review>

This place is amazing delicious. I took my boyfriend for his birthday, I mentioned it when I made the reservation and they hooked us up with a tasty bday treat- they even put a candle in it! The staff here was kind and attentive. The food was dope. If you like Indian and want it a fresh new way check this place out. Also just loved the decor- no Indian meal is complete without a Bollywood movie playing somewhere in the room.</text>

This review is for the brand new Rancho Bernardo location. Absolutely delicious! I went to the lunch buffet and it is sort of a soft opening right now because it is not officially open yet and the old name with the old owner sign is still up, but these are new owners and they are the same as the original Sher-E-Punjab, And the food is absolutely delicious! Very friendly and kind and respectful service. I did not feel uneasy eating alone as a woman. They had a wonderful variety perfectly seasoned Northern Indian dishes. They did have some Southern Indian options as well, but they are Northern Indian, themselves. The basmati rice was fresh, and did not taste like it had been sitting around all day. The price of the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet is very affordable. While I do eat meat sometimes, I primarily I'm vegetarian or even vegan, and they had absolutely a delicious variety of vegetarian friendly food! They make their own cheese there, And I tried the paneer tikka. Very perfectly seasoned, and their homemade cheese is light and fluffy. Also, unlike many all you can eat buffets I have been to, this seemed very fresh and the food was not overly salty. It was just perfectly seasoned. Another standout dish was the veggie korma, which is one of my favorite dishes, and I will say this is the best veggie korma I have ever tasted. The restaurant is very clean, and I will definitely go back and bring my friends. Another thing about the service, it was just right. If you needed someone they were available, so you never felt like you were being ignored, but there was no hovering either, which was great! Really fantastic, and I can't wait until the location on Bernardo Center Drive is officially open and known to the public!<//Text>

<Text>Went in for lunch on a weekend. It is quite ordinary or subpar Indian restaurant. The buffet lacks variety and quality when compared with price at other Indian food restaurants in the vicinity.
We went in a 1pm and had to make good with bottom scraping for most items.< /Text>< pics>

3 star for value for money buffet. Can't expect more from a 9 usd buffet. Its a decent quick and cheap eat! Tandoori chicken was overcooked, Daal fry and matar paneer was nicely prepared. Overall veg options were better than the non-veg.<//text>

The lamb biryani is so delicious. I asked for very spicy and they made it very spicy and delicious. The lamb is tasty and tender. The rice is so flavorful. They give you so much lamb. Overall, great Indian food. If you are in the San Diego area and crave Indian food, try this place.</Review>

Awesome food!!! We live in Mira Mesa and got bored of most of the Indian restaurants nearby..we wanted to try something different and stopped by here..every dish we ordered had a unique flavor and quantity was lot more for a single person to handle..service was good as well. Overall we really liked this place and would definitely make several visits in future :)</Text>

The veg biriyani had lot of white rice in it. Looks like it wasn't mixed well. Aloo paratha, one of the worst I even had.

<Text>Placed to go order , lamb tikka masala and tandoori roti . Food was totally disappointing. Lamb was too hard , chewy and tasted so bittery. Looked like the lamb was kept frozen for long time. Curry and Roti was ok . The only go to food my husband and I suggest here is their regular lamb biriyani (not the dhum biriyani). And yes it taste way better on weekdays than weekends!<//Text>< Pics>

I had such a delicious experience for my first time eating at this restaurant. The Goat Curry was flavorful, spicey, and tender. The environment was pleasant, clean, and classy with enjoyable music. Finally the service by Manoj was polite and friendly. I am coming back with friends for sure to enjoy their buffet next time!! - David</text>

<Review>It is one of the best worst Indian restaurant one can find in San Diego. I would like to give ZERO STARS if I could.
Seriously, $12.92 for a worthless buffet made out of remains in your fridge and canned food. Rather I can go to a grocery store and buy a frozen meal for $3.99. I am very knowledgeable about the restaurant business and kitchen. It is absolutely waste of money. Every cheffing dish was empty. They don’t even refill anything except water after asking twice. I understand if it is busy, but they had three tables not all at the same time. I can assure you that you will be wasting your money and time if you are in real hungry. They do not give a feel that you pay for the food. Really very simple menu with lot of reheated food. If you are not a chef you may not know the difference between the fresh and reheated one. I know very well how a restaurant works as I am a chef in one of the finest star hotel. I’m not expecting a Michelin star food for the price, but it should appropriate with standards. With the Mexicans you cannot get any better Indian food. You better hire some good Indian chefs or shut down the place. IF YOU SIMPLY WANT TO SEE THE PROFIT WITHOUT SATISFYING YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU BETTER SHUT IT DOWN. AS A FELLOW INDIAN I AM GIVING A FINAL ADVICE. DON'T ROB PEOPLE'S MONEY. DON’T EVEN THINK TO GO THERE... ABSOLUTE NONSENSE< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>I have been to India and am a big fan of all her food. Dakshin is the highest quality not just authentic but uses the best ingredients in Southern California. Great and friendly service, and beautiful chai. I have many favorites  shrimp korma, topping the list. The buffet is wonderful as well. I prefer this place to enjoy Indian food outside of India herself... Dhanyavaad!<//text>< UserId.>

Food was amazing but not their' s no attention for the beverage refills.  Just in future pay attention to  customers beverages that they are readily available for customers for refills that 3/5.  Hire more people to avoid lack of customer service.    Thanks.< /Text>

It is a decent restaurant. Food is made fresh only.

Dosa tastes good. Rava Dosa and Masala Dosa will be too good. But the taste of Sambar and chutneys must be improved.

Rotis and gravies were good. Sizzlers tasted very average. But fresh.

Restaurant is neat and clean. Service is good.</Text>

< Review>
My favorite Indian place in San Diego.  Lunch and dinner are traditional and delicious.  Food is traditional Indian style, with whole spices in food for strong traditional flavors (people, if you find a cinnamon sticks in your food just set it  to side of the plate and keep eating).

Love the buffet, yes it's all you can eat.  Take your time, enjoy the sights, scents, and Indian atmosphere.  Don't waste-- you can take a bit, and come back for more if you like next time.

Traditionally seasoned ragout-style dishes, Spinach paneer, Tikka Masala, usually a dhal, vegetarian and meat (chicken, lamb, sometimes seafood) choices.   Seasoned with mouth watering mustard seed, cumin, fennel, peppers, magnificent cardamom!  If you're lucky on a weekday there will be gulab jamun those deliciously cardmom and rose spiced milk dough balls floating in sugar for desert!<//Review>

there was just one veg curry for buffet of 12 bucks. Everything else was non-veg. Naan wasn't made fresh. Not the best dine in buffet experience for the price. Last time when I went, there were 3 veg, 3 non veg option and naan were served fresh.<//Review>

Service was great. We had a lot of questions and all were answered with grace and personality. Food was good. We were there on the weekend and the buffet is very expensive. Decided to order off the menu which ended up a lot less expensive for us.  We had heard about a dish called dosa which they had and enjoyed trying two different types of that. Dosa is what I am eating in the picture.
Update and funny story: we went a second time. This time took a friend recently moved here from India. He inquired about the "expensive" buffet I mentioned with my first review and clarified the price was $13.99. We heard $30.99 on our first visit due to the accent of the geniune Indian staff😁< /Review>

OMG! I'm so happy to have found this place. I thought it was likely something special when I noticed it was filled with Indians and it turns out it was. We ordered the lamb biryani and chicken tikka masala, both outstanding, along with the garlic naan. Yummy! Seriously the best Indian food I've ever had. The dishes were authentic and boasted fresh, quality ingredients. Be forewarned that medium spicy here is pretty hot. Your sinuses will clear out right away. I can't wait to go back to try some of the other tantilizing menu options. Highly recommend! Come here.<//Review>

They recently came into new ownership and the quality has improved a LOT. Their food is always good and their lunch buffet is worth the price. Best indian I've had in RB.< /Text>

Not really good. Chicken 65 is worst not any spices, no salt nothing on it. Briyani ok good. Bad impression.<//Text>

The chicken tikka masala was delicious.  The place is clean and presentable.  The lunch buffet at 11$ was worth the price.  I will come back every time I crave for Indian food.

The samosa was not the best though.  It seemed stale and not fresh enough<//text>

The food always shows up hot and on time.  The veggie samosas are fantastic with a fresh herb taste.  The Dal Makhani is the best entree we've tried with a nice complex spice mix.  The Chicken Tikka Masala isn't my favorite as it is a bit bland.  The naan here is really good and shows up delivered hot and soft.  The best is the garlic naan obviously. Pro tip:  the spicy option is pretty darn hot.</text>< rating>

<rate>1<//rate><review>One of the worst South Indian restaurants in California, we paid for the shittiest buffet ever. In the name of sambhar these guys served raw tomato purée with some vegetables, every dish was bad. Just by giving an authentic name as Dakshin the food does not become authentic. You need extra ordinary culinary skills to make it work and for South Indian food one should keep it simple.

Do not eat here.... when somebody says let's eat at Dakshin, run in the opposite direction!!!</review>< Pics>

<text>Very average Indian food experience.

The Naan was bland and saaj paneet, Tikka masala, and others were just average. Nothing too special.

The seat in my booth was falling apart. Hostess tried to fix it to no avail. Recommend going to any other Indian place for a better experience.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>Had  been there  for lunch buffet on Saturday afternoon. Expected lot of variety for weekend buffet. Very ordinary. All items are  tasteless. Not a single item is fresh. It is not authentic south indian. Thandoori chicken was super dry, hard and tasteless. Chilli chicken is like rubber because coating.::extremely disappointed. Name of the restaurent Is not justified.< /text>< Name>

Located in a unassuming little complex, this restaurant is surprisingly good. The curry is flavorful without being overpowering. I tried the tandoor chicken an Rogan Josh and enjoyed both. Their naan is delicious and the khulfi is delightful. My only dissapointment was the Mango lasi; it tasted more like pineapple than mango.<//Review>

<text>I came to this place on Thursday , for the buffet as shown in the website , and went inside to take a look at at buffet they have , but I got disappointed about what the host told me that no open buffet on Thursday but I showed her the website and she told me that was old and we don't have buffet on Thursday , and maybe the owner didn't take it off from the website, and unfortunately I already invited my family to that place , but they were not happy, so we have to go somewhere else to eat .
Bad day .<//text>< Pictures>

Food was OK but not as good as it was under the previous owners. The menus were out of date and had incorrect pricing. The single server was not attentive, probably because he was very busy.</Review>

The food was very good and the presentation was very enticing. I had the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and steak, proceeded by a delicious salad. At first the dressing on the salad was very salty. We sent it back and were offered profuse apologies and a new salad that was perfect. The owner was very personable and funny. He gave us a free Panna cota dessert which is creamy and delectable. I would definitely go there again.< /review>

Pasta was delicious, scallops less so. Ambiance was way too loud and tables are 6 inches apart. Drunken man next to us wouldn’t leave us alone and nobody helped us.</Text>

<Text>Mangia Tornò - roughly translated, to eat and come back!   The food here was fantastic.  If you know good Italian food then this isn’t a disappointing experience and the staff are all very attentive (as you would expect).   I am from the U.K. but worked all over Italy for many years and these guys do a great job in bringing a taste of Italy to this fantastic area of California.  Would highly recommend.<//Text><time>1536337898311<//time>< Name>

<user_name>Dillon Reinking< /user_name><review>Service was real bad. Waiter comes, briskly takes our order and leaves. Apps and wine come out quickly enough but we don't see our entrees or even our waiter checking in for almost 45 minutes. He then brings out the food one plate at a time to our party. Never asking if we even wanted our wine refilled our even acknowledging that there was a massive wait. Food was not that great when it did come out and definitely did not make up for the lack of contact with the wait staff.
Kind of a bummer of a night.<//review>< response>

<Gmap_id>0x80859a78f43e1631:0x62b3def364034796< /Gmap_id><text>As Italian food goes, the food is a cut above nearby Don Antonio, or Il Forniao or Jason's. Quite excellent. I had not known that Bolognese sauce is supposed to have carrot in it, that you can taste. The waiter explained this to us after we asked what was in it, because we found it so delicious and interesting. The service is relaxed and friendly, very nice. I have one major complaint though. In the inside dining room when we were there, which was at the beginning of dinner service, maybe 5:30 or 6, there was a really loud noise happening from some machinery in the kitchen. It was constant and very distracting. In the patio out front it was quieter and nicer. If you go, see if you can get a seat in the front patio. They should really do something about the noise. In addition to the machinery noise, the music they were playing in the kitchen was at about the same volume as the music playing in the dining room, so the sound experience was terrible. Only one star off though, because it's otherwise such a special place.</text>< userid>

Long wait time, immature staff. We ordered lemonade, he came back 10 minutes later says “we’re out of lemonade” we order an Brussels sprout meal, 10 minutes later, guess what? There out of Brussels sprouts :/ And it was only 7:30! Clearly unprepared with food. 1 star is just because the food was good.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Food was mediocre, service was great, expediting and busing need major improvement. Our entrees each came out individually and about 3-5 minutes apart.  Wine pairing is spot on. Noise level is HIGH. Will I be back for the Fettuccine Carbonara, no., but I will give it a second try.<//review>

Delicious Italian fare. The papardelle with oxtails will fill you and warm you on a cold winter's evening.< /Text>

My husband and I are locals and this was our first time at Gia's'; however, we have dined at every restaurant at this location since the 80's! This was a memorable night:  the ambiance is light and up yet relaxing; the food is amazing,  different and plated with a flair ( thanks Stefano) ;  and the service exceptional. Fabrizio the owner is friendly and genuinely interested in his customers , Ettore our waiter was more than top of the line...friendly ...helpful ....engaging. All the servers who interacted with us were attentive and actually looked you in the face and smiled...that's' a class act!  Grazie, Maria O'Rourke</text>

<Review>HIGHLY recommend Plumbing Buddies. Honest & trustworthy work. My water heater went out on Christmas Eve and Jeremy had a new one installed immediately.  Very informative and educational - I know more about water heaters than I ever thought I would. If you are in need of a plumber don't go anywhere else.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c32628ec9a7e1d:0x2a9286b3cde6b288<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Leak from the hot water facet in my tub was increasing each day without being turned on. Plumbing Buddies was cordial when I called and responded immediately. I had used and paid in the past promised to come but never did and didn’t call me back with any explanation covid 19 was the main culprit but I do appreciate a company that responds and makes every effort to help.< /Text>

<text>Jeremy was amazing. He was very courteous and professional in his personality and performance. I had a leaking water heater at both the drain and relief valve due to the incompetency of another plumber I hired that couldn’t get the job done and left it a mess.

From the initial consultation over the phone with Jeremy to describe the issue, I could already tell that he had the technical experience and understanding to get the job done correctly. Always nice to have someone knowledgeable pick up the phone to give that feel of assurance. Jeremy is that guy. I felt confident choosing him and was right.

Performance wise, Jeremy worked efficiently and in a very clean manner. There was no mess to clean up or anything. He finished a job that the other plumber claimed to have not been possible, clearly wasn’t as Jeremy got it done and saved me the cost of buying a a brand new water heater.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

We needed our garden hose faucet replaced and a shut off valve installed inside the laundry room. Bob's work was thorough and neat. He also was very professional when we were asking questions.

< Review>
We had a gas water heater that needed to be replaced.  After calling Plumbing Buddies Monday morning, we were pleasantly surprised that they could fit us in.  Dave came out early evening (when he said he would) and did a fantastic job.  I could not ask for more.  I felt like he was taking care of us as if we were part of his family.  He even followed up the next day to make sure everything was perfect.  He was extremely kind, knowledgeable, organized and clean.  He also made sure that we were aware of the rebates that we could take advantage of.  All in all, I wish I could give them more than full stars.  Thanks Plumbing Buddies!!!</Review>

The water heater went out in my rental house. Got on the phone first thing in the morning and spoke with Jeremy. He was at the house  a half hour later. Called me saying he had good news. Was just debris in the heater preventing the pilot from staying on. Fixed!  After further discussion I asked if he could just replace the heater as I knew it was old.   ( turned out it was 20 years old!)He had the new heater in by 3pm and my tenant was thrilled. Jeremy also installed a high efficiency heater instead of a cheaper unit. Good call.  Pricing was fair and the service was very friendly. I'd recommend him, if you need a solid plumber look no further. Call Jeremy<//review>

When our hot water service broke at 11.30pm, I feel like I called a Plumbing Buddies. he turned up when he said he would within half an hour, made everything safe for us and quoted us for a new unit to be installed first thing the next morning. Everyone we met was extremely friendly, explained what was happening, and stuck to the quote even when things turned out a lot more difficult than expected. The guys clearly take a lot of pride in their work, looked after us, and left the place spotless. I will recommend them to anyone who will listen.</Review>

We had an excellent experience with Plumbing Buddies. He was helpful and stuck with the diagnostic process, and we ultimately able to resolve our problem. The price was definitely reasonable for the number of times he had to visit to try to figure out the issue and make the repairs. I would highly recommend this company.<//Text>

Found a blocked drain on the side of the house this morning. Called Plumbing Buddies based in reviews. Arrived promptly and cleared the 'fatberg'. Advised me on future handling so as to avoid recurrence. At the same time found a problem with the existing pipes entering the aforementioned. Plumber was able to correct the problem quickly and efficiently. Also the fees were very reasonable< /text>

I would HIGHLY recommend Plumbing Buddies, and will never hesitate to call them as my first and only choice for plumbing services. specifically,  went above and beyond his job to make sure our concerns were handled in a timely manner.  I can’t express enough gratitude to him specifically.  Thank you Luke, and Plumbing Buddies!</review>

After looking online and seeing good reviews I called to arrange a visit to price up repairing a toilet and a price for replacing the toilet. Both were very reasonable. Communication was excellent and text to keep me informed when he was coming, he came on time, polite, did a great job, and left everywhere tidy. I have made a permanent note of his number and will definitely be using him again in the future. Highly recommended. Thank you, Plumbing Buddies!!</review>

I was looking around for a plumbing company, and he was the only company that could come to my house right away. There prices are better than a lot of companies, they were there on time.
Plumbing Buddies had his plumber Austin come to my house and install a new kitchen  Fossett and I was very pleased with his work. I would recommend that company to anybody.</Text>

<Review>Excellent service!
The staff at Plumbing Buddies was very helpful and friendly. Tech was very efficient and knowledgeable. He got the job done quickly.  Finally I had hot water! He also took time to explain things to me, the whys and hows of of the problem so I could understand what was going on. He is a very personable, up beat and positive guy and conveyed confidence in his work and in the company he represented.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c32628ec9a7e1d:0x2a9286b3cde6b288<//gmapID></record>

55 yr old house with cast iron piping.  Plumbing Buddies was very knowledgeable and explained every step.  He discussed the work before starting and showed their price for each service, no up charging or changing in mid stream.  Got an estimate for future work we plan to do later.

<Text>I had Plumbing Buddies come in to replace the toilet flange and shower drain. I also had a kitchen drain pipe section that needed replacing. They came in with a jackhammer and had everything done in 3.5 hrs. They said that they would come back in 2 days to complete the concrete floor and setup the shower base. They came as promised and everything was done at a reasonable price. Don't worry about using them.<//Text>< UserId.>

Plumbing Buddies is as honest and professional as they come...He serviced  units and the hot water unit after a sloppy job by the original installer. He spent hours on the phone with customer service and explaining the issue to me, and best options to solve it. I highly recommend Plumbing Buddies.<//review>

Plumbing Buddies came out on time and was able to give me a good quote on everything I needed done which included a tank less water heater, water softener and laundry sink in my garage. They worked together and had everything done in a timely manner. They went above and beyond and put the salt tank for the softener in a better location to make the job of filling it easier. I highly recommend them.<//text>

<review>Found a blocked drain on the side of the house this morning. Called Plumbing Buddies based in Hertfordshire. Arrived promptly and cleared the 'fatberg'. Advised me on future handling so as to avoid recurrence. At the same time found a problem with the existing pipes entering the aforementioned. Plumber was able to correct the problem quickly and efficiently. Also the fees were very reasonable<//review>< pics>

Jeremy the owner did an excellent job in fixing my shower trim cartridge.  He was on time and very professional.  He even gave me tips on how to correctly operate the shower spout diverter after turning off the shower knob which I was not aware of and was doing it all wrong all this time.  A friend of mine referred me to Plumbing Buddies and I’m so glad she did!  I will definitely Call them on future plumbing issues and I even gave their business card to my neighbor.< /Text>

<Review>Plumbing Buddies and team was an absolute champion, guided me through emergency fix over the phone, then attended site ASAP the next day to save an after hours call out. Found the leak, fixed it, cleaned the lines, cleared the shower filter and inspired the kids to take up plumbing. good with time and work.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

He is probably the coolest plumber I’ve met and extremely blunt and honest about what you need and don’t need. I love it.

A plumber was required to track the source of an unexplained leak in property. The source was tracked to the bathroom in the flat above mine and confirmed by the plumbing engineer for area. Photos of the flooding problem were taken and the engineer showed me the ‘evidence’. I may need this because the owner of the flat above is proving to be ‘difficult’ about resulting damage to my property. The engineer was helpful, professional and reassuring. Thank you< /Review>

Great experience with Plumbing Buddies! Jeremy responded the same day to fix the issue with my water heater pilot. While servicing it, he showed me a bigger problem! After thoroughly explaining all options, I decided to switch to a tankless water heater. Thank you Jeremy! He returned and perfectly installed the tankless and life is good! I highly recommend this company and you'd be supporting this great veteran also!</review>

After having read the bio from Plumbing Buddies and feeling quite confident in their integrity I decided to place a request. It was a pleasure communicating with Mike and starting the process. The issue was a slow draining tub.
I thought maybe a minor issue of just clearing local to the bathroom.  Thank you Jeremy. Jeremy  came to the house explained the process and began. After multiple unsuccessful  attempts, Jeremy did further assessments on the problem. He determined that the process, was a project, and was more involved.I reside in an older home with much older plumbing. I appreciated his honesty and his estimate. The estimate was very reasonable. Thank you for being able to schedule me in so quickly and being prompt. I can’t say thank you enough.< /review>

Plumbing Buddies replaced a recirculating pump on my hot water heater. They arrived on time and were very professional. Unfortunately the pump that was installed was defective and there was a small leak. I called after hours and left a message about the problem. quickly returned my call and had another tech to my house within 30 min to remedy the problem. I am extremely happy with their professionalism, great customer service and high quality of work. I will definitely use Plumbing Buddies in the future</review>

<Review>Our experiences with Plumbing Buddies have been nothing but positive.  They are able to schedule appointments for the next day or two, they give you a time frame in which the plumber will arrive, and they stick to it.  Brett was great. Very friendly but good at respecting social distance. He was honest, and fixed our problem in a timely & cost friendly manner.  Will call them again when necessary.</Review>< username>

Plumbing Buddies saved the day! He found the issue quickly and repaired it just as fast. The price was a fraction of what I had as a worst case in my head. Thank God for honest and professional plumbers. Thanks!</Text>

I was very impressed with the way the whole project was undertaken. From the very start, including preparatory work, the whole project was done in an extremely efficient, logical and successful way. Best of all – no mess at the end! I’d be delighted to recommend Plumbing Buddies to anybody.<//review>

Our plumber responded right away. He explained the process and reassured he will fix clogged pipes one way or another. He had and executed a solution with confidence. I have a very old house and was pleased with the overall service they provided.
Thanks again!!< /text>

< review>
Had a clogged sewage line emergency on a Sunday morning. Called Plumbing Buddies and they were onsite in no time. Mike assessed the situation and provided with clear options and estimate. He was great, along with fixing the problem at hand, he also thoroughly answered other plumbing (maintenance type) questions I had. I have future projects I need to do and Mike gave me some rough estimates for those too.
Work was done in less than an hour and I now have some peace of mind knowing what I need to tackle next. Highly recommend these guys for the quality value and service!< /review>

Had a Water Heater leaking and contacted Plumbing Buddies.  Jeremy answered the phone and I told him what the problem was.  After a few questions he knew exactly what the problem was and said I needed a new water heater.  From the past I had a friend who had the exact problem so I know he was right.  He quoted me a great price and said he could come out the same day.  Due to my schedule I had to set the install for the next day.  The job was done sooner then he had thought it would and take.  Within a few hours  I had hot water again and no leak.  The job was done above standards.  I'd 100% use Plumbing Buddies again.  Thanks guys< /text>

Great experience! They texted me about 20 minutes before he arrived. He was friendly and professional. His work was top notch and he also gave helpful tip on how to best take care of the plumbing at my house.

I was very satisfy with the service call. He showed up ahead of schedule and explained to me what my problem was. He was very professional and easy going. I would prefer to have him again if and when I call for future service. He is a very friendly technician that seems to know what he's talking about. Thanks Plumbing Buddies.</text>

He came out to look at a blocked laundry sink. He arrived when he said he would and was very knowledgeable a friendly. Issue not resolved as it is a warranty issue and I decided to chase up with builder but he gave me all the different options and was excellent in finding out what the problem was. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

Don't look further. I had two bathrooms backup on a Sunday.  They came out and were able to fix one shower and both commodes. Due to my travel over the holidays they came back when it was a good time for me. The total charge was just $150. They explained what they were doing and very sensitive to not tracking water all over the rooms. I can't say enough good about them.  Jeremy and "the other Jeremy" were great. Thank you Plumbing Buddies.<//review>

These guys were absolutely amazing! They relined our blocked drain without the expense and mess of digging and taking out old pipe. Very happy with the price as normal method of pulling out would have cost us a fortune and left a huge mess. Would highly recommend - very friendly and professional. Thanks guys!<//review>

<Text>During a world pandemic and all on lock down and I end up with a broken pipe. i contacted Mike sent him some pictures and he came out of his area and replaced my pipe.  I cant tell you how grateful I am. I am female and was worried about being over charged but I was giving a better deal than I expected. He arrived on time, very professional and nice. I would rate their service, performance and professionalism a 10. If your a single woman and have plumbing problems  this the company to call. Again thank you so much...</Text>< Pictures>

Friendly and professional service. They were able to send someone out the same day to investigate an issue and the plumber was able to fix the problem on the spot. They made a number of recommendations for further work but took a 'no pressure' approach and followed up with a quote for consideration after completing the job.<//review>

He did everything he said he was going to do. He and his tech showed up on time and stayed on the job, even though it was a struggle for I had unique situation with the plumbing in my slab foundation. He provided a solution that made it easier to clear my main sewer drain at a good price.<//review>

< review>
We had a clogged kitchen sink on a Friday night.  We contacted Plumbing Buddies and set an appointment for the next day. Mike came early and got the job done.  We have old pipes and knew it could have turned into a bigger problem. Mike was able to fix the sink and save our pipes.  We were thrilled with the work and are so glad to support a local business. They truly are tradesmen not salesmen.</review>

I had a broken water heater that was over 25 years old and had not been previously installed professionally. What a difference it makes to see quality workmanship and materials!  I was consulted along the way and came away with a great sense of confidence.  I’d use Plumbing Buddies again as well recommend them.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Was having an issue with my main line. Jeremy answered my call and was able to come out that next morning. He was able to get the line clear quick and then ran a camera to show me what I thought to be the bigger problem roots. He was very sweet and professional walked me through everything. I was a little nervous about the estimate but it was a very fair price and he also advise me of the 12 month no intrest financing. I will be calling the Plumbing Buddies again soon to schedule the Install Main Sewer Cleanout. Thanks again Jeremy for all your help.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Honest and Forthright.

Hired these guys for a home inspection. There was a misunderstanding and I voiced a complaint and then Jeremy sent me a full refund, which is more than I was expecting. Jeremy and his guys are honest as the day is long, would not hesitate to hire them again.</Text>

Nothing is scarier than a gas leak at your house. We called a few plumbers in our area and decided to go with Plumbing Buddies.
Jeremy and his team did an excellent job with not only replacing an old, leaking gas line, bringing it up to code with rerouting the pipes and installing a new shutoff valve but also replacing our ancient water heater. All in ONE DAY!

I highly recommend them to everyone who needs any plumbing work done because they are fast, reliable, and offer very competitive prices.
Thank you again for going above and beyond! We appreciate you treating our house as your own. You earned our business for our next project!</review>

Look no further, you’ve found your go to plumber. Plumbing issues are normally immediate and extremely intrusive, which is why it can normally feel like you’re being taken advantage of. Jeremy is fast, reliable, and honest. He’s more than willing to go the extra mile for his customers and I’ll never use anyone else.<//Text>

First of all, they answered the phone while on another job, when no other company I called had.  Then, the owner, Jeremy, gave me verbal instructions and sent a technician I called, another Jeremy, as soon as possible, which was 30ish minutes.  He went straight to work, diagnosing my problem in minutes.  He explained it to me in layman terms I could understand.  He gave me options I could afford.  He then left, got the parts he needed, came back in 20 minutes and finished the job.  He was fast, kind , knowledgeable and professional.  I’ve never needed a plumber in Covina before, and I’m so grateful I found this company.  I’ll never call anyone else for all my plumbing needs.</text>< pics>

<Text>It was a dark and stormy night, but all was well. You have a nice cozy home, with food in the fridge, a great show on television, and you know you'll have a nice warm shower before bed . . . Oh wait! (record scratch!) The water heater is busted! Dreams of a nice hot shower have just faded into the abyss of home warranty night mares and frigid water . . . there's even water flooding your garage!

The home warranty was a waste of time and money, but thankfully I was able to find Jeremy at Plumbing Buddies. We have already had two full days without warm water as we waited for the home warranty plumber to even deem us worthy of having a written estimate - just to find out they were going to ream us with out-of-pocket costs that didn't make sense. Plumbing Buddies were only a few miles away, and they were able to give a quick estimate and get the job done in only a few hours. They were even able to work with ME, and I'm not easy.

Spending money on these types of things is never fun - it is always unexpected, and it always comes at a bad time (What's a good time?). That's why it is so important to have a team that will keep it real, and that will not take advantage of your lack of plumbing knowledge.

I'm happy to have found that team in Plumbing Buddies. :)</Text>< resp>

Plumbing Buddies were courteous and thorough when explaining all our options after our garbage disposal went out. They were at my house within hours of the initial phone call, installed the new disposal, and even gave us a few tips on how to maintain the sink and the disposal. Highly recommend.<//Text>

<Text>We needed our entire house to be repiped;  Not only did Jeremy and Mike do a great job, clean, and in a timely manner, but they were patient in explaining what they were going to do, step by step, and why they needed to do it!  Willing to show/share the process;  they were polite,  concerned, and asked us for permissions before starting a new area.  Always arranged for us to have areas in our house that were unaffected so we were not inconvenienced.  Needed them to return a couple months later for an adjustment due to a new cabinet.  They came within 2 days, and were quick and friendly, as always.  They have become my go-to guys!  Very competitive in price,  and professional.  You can't go wrong with them!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1568841837397, 'text': 'Thank you Deborah, It means the world to us that you were so happy with the repipe, it can be stressful at times with projects of this size.

Mike is great. Was punctual with the appointment time and very professional. Took care of my plumbing problems right away and took the time to explain what the problem was and how to prevent further plumbing issues. Would strongly recommend Plumbing Buddies to next person that needs their help.<//Review>

They were super helpful. Jeremy was professional and answered all of our questions. The work got done quickly and our shower looked really good when they were done. They were able to find a mistake that was done by our previous contractors and correct it.< /Review>

Well, can't say enough good things about this company and Jeremy! Had my 50 gal. ancient water heater go out which services our bathrooms and was desperate to get it repaired asap! Called and spoke with Jeremy, who said they would try to get out the same day and replace it. Good to his word, Anthony was out within two hours with a new one, replaced it and had it up and running despite having to upgrade all the hosing, and hardware. Two months later, the water heater to our kitchen goes out on Sunday, Jeremy was out today (Monday) with a replacement. It was so plugged with sediment, it wouldn't even drain. He had to carefully move it out of the cabinet in our kitchen fully loaded with 30 gals of water, drain it and replace it with a new one, which required all new hardware to bring it up to code, 4 hours later we had hot water! This was all accomplished without any damage to my floor or cabinet and Jeremy maintained a wonderful attitude despite this being extremely difficult and time consuming! Plumbing Buddies  is my plumbing choice and should be yours!< /Review>

So thankful for these guys! As soon as we called they were cordial and so very helpful! They knew exactly what we’re talking about with the little info we gave them.  ( our water heater stopped working ) we were able to text photos to them and each time we called or they called us back they remembered my fiancé’s name. Good prices, especially for same day delivery and installation. Very clean and very fast! Couldn’t recommend them enough!!<//text>

Plumbing Buddies are great. We had an emergency, contacted them and got a response right away. They offer to come and do a free evaluation. They even have an app that gives you status where they are, very efficient. Both Mike and Jeremy came. They are friendly, patient and educational. Although it turns out the issue wasn't plumbing related, I'm still glad we found them. A good plumber makes big difference. Gladly to support our local business.</review>

<Review>Great customer service! I am so pleased with the way plumbing buddies handled my kitchen sink issues. They were fast reliable. Gave me an over the phone estimate and also came in person to confirm problems. Worked with my schedule and were in and out fast. They found other problems that were creating the leak and they found a way to fix everything while keeping the cost reasonable! Definitely recommend them for anyone's plumbing needs!</Review>< pics>

I somehow broke off the water hose faucet outside the garage.  I called these guys, I texted them a picture of the damage.  Being an emergency due to water just spilling out this broken pipe, I needed service immediately.  They immediately told me they would be there in an hour or so. They showed up no more than forty minutes later.
He told me that it would be four hundred and fifty dollars but actually ended up being four hundred dollars with a military discount.
They had to cut plywood inside garage in order to reach the pipe.  They were done in no more than two hours.
I definitely recommend this business. They were fast, made themselves clear, and I felt they knew how to handle this situation pretty good.<//review>

Plumbing Buddies provided professional, totally hassle-free plumbing service for us. The plumber was very understanding in getting us the most appropriate appointment. Our kitchen sink drain was blocked and the garbage disposal stopped working. The plumber explained to us what caused the problem and finished the work on time.</review>

The very best plumbers I have ever experienced.  Extremely reliable, courteous, and knowledgeable plumbers.  Prices were  something we could afford and not over-inflated.  They fixed a long ongoing drainage problem with my bathroom sink.  The P-Trap joint was replaced as it had a leak and appeared to be the original to the house.  They also snaked the sink and bathtub completely through.  A clogged toilet was fix as well.  Really these guys are amazing and friendly. They then came back and did the most spectacular job on our sewer lines.   I would highly recommend them for all of your plumbing needs.<//Text>

<Review>If you're searching for honest plumbers with excellent experience, look no further! My husband and I were in escrow for a home and had another plumbing agency perform the inspection. They had informed us that we had a "crack" in our saddle of our sewage line and that we would require excavation of the line and replacement which would potentially cost up to $17K!!!!! Price tag alone gave us second thoughts about moving forward with the home.

Luckily, we decided to call around to get a second opinion and stumbled upon Plumbing Buddies. Jeremy and Mike were gracious enough to come to the property on short notice and give their own evaluation of the situation. They informed us that there was no issue with the line and that we would NOT need additional work performed. They were patient and took time to provide additional comments and educate us about the type of line we had at the home and different ways to maintain the line in the future. I am so grateful we found them and didn't waste thousands of dollars based on what the initial plumbing agency quoted us. Luckily we don't need any work done now, but if we do, we definitely will know who to call in the future!!!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c32628ec9a7e1d:0x2a9286b3cde6b288</gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

Jeremy and Mike showed up on time this morning (impressive for a Saturday) and were very professional.  They even asked if they should wear booties on their shoes!  I told them that would not be necessary  They quickly isolated the problem and made a quick and thorough fix.  Even better, they easily beat prior estimates for the job.  I will not hesitate to use Plumbing Buddies in the future and I cannot recommend them highly enough.< /Text>< Rate>

Plumbing Buddies was the best referral for a plumber we've ever received.
Jeremy and Mike promptly came to the rescue to resolve our excessively leaking water heater and replaced it with an amazing tankless unit. Additionally, they set up our dryer with a new hook up.
After preparing ourselves to hear that they wouldn't be available for at least a week or so to come over, they were able to come at our earliest convenience.
We are impressed not only with their diligence, knowledge and professional work ethic, but they are the coolest and friendliest plumbers we've ever met. They gave us a very fair and reasonable estimate and are officially now our plumbers for anything that comes up.< /Text>

< review>
I have purchased my house about 6 month ago.  It is a 1955 house with "Original" water line in the house.  The previous owner did some upgrades but did not follow the code at all.  Therefore, the water pressure is not the same for the whole house.  I have decided to ask a plumber to take a look my water line.  I called Plumbing Buddies in the morning and they showed up in the afternoon to take a look my water line.  They have seen some potential leaking due to material and work quality that previous plumber's work. They recommend to repipe the whole house.  It is not a cheap project and could go wrong if hired a wrong plumber.  I called Plumbing Buddies next day and ask for detail quotation.  They provided me the material will be using and what will be done in the quotation.  I did some research about the material and found out they use superior quality material.  You can see from the image that they use "UPONOR" pipe.  I decided to go with them and they showed up couple weeks later as promised.  The whole project took exactly 5 days as they mentioned in the beginning.  I have new pipes all over my house and I can feel the water is much fresher than before.  On the invoice, it states 20 years warranty.  I am sure with their quality of work, it should last forever.

By the way, they even help me to add a water line in my back yard for free.  Really honest people and professional.  My water heater is about 15 years old now.  Once it quits, I definitely will call them to replace it for me.<//review>

They are informative and educate you in understanding what you need to know in plumbing. I love that Jeremy & Mike put their client as a priority by arriving promptly, accommodating with schedule and by going out of their way to provide service. Not to mention, they have quite a humor! They are respectful and clean up after their job. I didn’t have to mention about wearing shoe covers either. I feel confident and totally comfortable with their work.

The first time I contacted Plumbing Buddies was for a gas leak at my house. My gas was shut off due to fumigation and a SoCal Gas technician who came back to turn on my gas discovered a gas leak in my house. This is when I made several calls to local plumbers and fortunately Jeremy was able to come first thing early morning the next day as he knew my situation was an emergency. Jeremy and Mike was able to locate 3 leaks in the attic with the gas shut off. They were able to immediately start on the repairs on the same day. After a SoCal Gas technician turned my gas services back on, Mike came back after his business hours to turn on my gas appliances. He was at a grocery store at the time and he made his way back for me!

A few days later I had a plumbing stoppage. I knew I had to call Plumbing Buddies again! My existing house only had a one way clean out to the main sewer line and for some reason the snake was not able to go through for the clean out. I recently bought my house and did not know of these plumbing issues. Luckily, Jeremy and Mike took the time to educate me through it and explained per building code, a house is suppose to have a 2-way clean out. No one wants a plumbing stoppage. To avoid it in the future I gave Plumbing Buddies the okay to install a 2-way clean out.

Overall, Plumbing Buddies is your to go for Plumbing issues. I wouldn’t hesitate to refer my friends and family to them. They are life savers! Thank you Jeremy and Mike!<//review><UserId.>110069559411062405888</UserId.>< Resp>

I have finally found my plumbing team! I was referred to Jeremy and Mike by my boss so I gave them a call about a leak in my kitchen. They were on another job, so I was expecting them around noon, but they pleasantly surprised me by coming over a couple hours early! They set to work trying to assess the situation and found the problem quickly.  They told me the deal frankly and honestly. Then they went above and beyond by getting me in touch with another team that could help me with the water damage. What service!

These guys are a fun, prompt and responsive, amazing team. I wouldn't have anyone else do my plumbing ever! Thanks guys<//review>

<text>After a very bad experience with another plumber, we call Jeremy to see if he could fix our tankless water heater that plumber 1 damaged.   After several attempts at repair at no charge, we ended up buying a new heater.  Plumbing Buddies installed the new heater.  If I had to do it all over again, I would start with Plumbing Buddies!</text>< GmapID>

<text>Like to start by telling everyone that Plumbing Buddies is an A-1 plumbing business. I got a few quotes from other plumbing companies for a total repipe and was shocked by how much they wanted for an entire house. Jeremy and Mike came over, diagnosed where my leak was coming from and made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. They blew the competitors quote out of the water with a cost that was far less than theirs. They started immediately and finished the whole repipe in 5 days. There were a few curveballs my 1950’s house threw at them but they had a solution for every one of them. I’m giving them 5 stars for their expertise, efficiency and friendliness. This is a company that you can rely on for leaks, toilet replacements, water heater installations, etc. i had all those done during the job. I’ll definitely recommend them to my friends and families.

We called Plumbing Buddies to replace our outdoor tankless water heater. After calling several plumbers in addition to Lowes, we found Jeremy on the phone to be the most helpful, straightforward, and honest about our options, pricing, and the quality of the products we could choose from, including warranty and rebate information which no one else had shared with us.

So we decided to go with them and install the Takagi 9.3 gallon per minute water heater to replace the lower quality Rinnai that the builder had put in. Plumbing Buddies scheduled an optimal time for us to do the replacement, were on time, organized, efficient, and effective. Also very friendly, and they answered our many questions.

Since the contemporary units are wider and built a bit differently than previous models ten years ago, the new unit’s air vents didn’t line up with the metal panel the builder had installed on the outside of our house for the water heater. After we already decided on a very reasonable price (much more reasonable than the ridiculous price Lowes gave us, which was for a much lower quality water heater), Jeremy offered to enlarge the opening on the panel, and so cut the metal to size right away. Obviously, they came prepared for multiple scenarios.

Everything fit perfectly, and the new unit was up and running in a little less than two hours. The new unit works perfectly and will save us a lot of trouble in the long run, especially for the higher quality, longer warranty, and higher efficiency of this unit than what we probably would’ve gotten elsewhere. All in all, highly recommend Plumbing Buddies! Very personable and professional!<//text>

Someone referred me to Plumbing Buddies when I was having water heater problems. Came out quickly. Walked me through all my options and answered any questions I had. Ended up going to a tankless water heater. It was ordered and put in within days. Great job and now I am considering a repipe with them because I feel confident in their work and prices. Will call them now for any future plumbing needs. Thank you Jeremy and Mike!<//Text>

<text>Meadowview Park is a cute neighborhood park with a nice playground and a couple of baseball diamonds. There is a covered area with tables, great for a picnic or bbq. The park only has street parking so during baseball season both Meadowview and Kost Roads are full of vehicles.</text></record>

It would be nice to have the lawn mowed. With uneven ground below the long grass, it can be a bit hazardous. Thank you.</Review>

<user_id>105964017233380092566<//user_id><Response>None</Response><review>I found this place on Yelp and based on their high rating, I decided to give their carne asada tacos a try. They were very meaty, with only a couple of traces of fat. The salsas are really good. Even the spicy one had a lot of flavor. They gave me freshly made chips and they were very good too. To top it off, they have reasonable prices. I will be back to try other things on the menu. It's a smaller setting, not much seating but really quaint atmosphere.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

<review>Went there for the first time last night. Cashier & Cook were friendly, helpful and we shared a few laughs. Ordered the house burrito for myself and a Cali burrito for my lady. Probably one of the best tasting burritos I've had the pleasure of eating. With decent/competitive prices, I'd say that this little Mexican/seafood joint is a definite go to if your in the mood for what they offer. Great job guys!<//review><Time>1542642851486</Time><gmap_id>0x80d957020b0800e7:0x727ab1223840ffcf< /gmap_id>< username>

<rate>2< /rate><text>Beware. Looks like new owners/operators. Fish burrito was nothing like it was before with the original guys. Its smaller and needed more flavor in the batter and sauce. Got a cocktail and it was about half Tomato and half seafood. With the original guys it was mostly all shrimp or octopus, not to mention the price was insane for a cocktail now. Sorry but a 7$ Fish Burrito from any taco shop near here is as good or better.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

There's not much room to sit inside, as there's only two counters for seating. This is in an out of the way strip mall, but definitely worth going out of your way for.< /Review>< Date>

<review>For a while, I was pretty dissapointed every time I went here because the food was pretty hit or miss after the old chef left. But it looks like they redid their menu and the flavors were pretty good. Still worried it might be inconsistent, but seems like they're back on track.< /review>< Rating>

The house burrito is awesome.  Also I tried the 50/50 rolled tacos and they were great.  A little pricier than normal taco shop, but way more creative items and better ingredients.  Also, I hate soggy fries am frequently disappointed with Cali burritos but the fries inside the house burrito were nice and crispy!< /text>

<review>Went to restaurant I saw that your out hot sauces, I ask if they had any more, they said they were out. You go to Mexican food you expect to eat  it hot sauce/salsa. My wife order the taco but price of the taco I would expected being bigger, but flavor it was okay. . The roll taco I order didn't come with avocado, pico de Gallo and didn't even give me lime.wasnt even close to the picture we saw on Yelp it looked really sad. Just came with little bit guacamole and lettuce. I might be harsh giving one star but this was really disapointing. So I change 2 star cause kinda like flavor of the taco.< /review><UserId.>107393366676126572072< /UserId.><response>{'time': 1555291263365, 'text': 'May i ask why 1 star?'}< /response></record></dataset><record>

By far the best taco shop in San Diego. Everything is unique and I would recommend which ever taco or burrito you choose house style. My personal favorites are the scallop tacos house style and the mango habenero quesadilla. Try it and enjoy! You will not regret it, they also have menu items for alternative diets and they will customize anything anyway you want<//review>

The ceviche was okay. There was a disappointing amount of fish in it, and I think he fish is cooked. Which was weird but not bad... Also, for 16oz of ceviche, two tostadas is most definitely not enough.

We'll be back to try again some other time< /Text>

They have good house fries but don't order anything garlic. They don't have a restroom for customers and for mexican resturant they don't serve guacamole and I love guacamole. It's kind of a hole in the wall. It is hyped up for so-so food.</review>

Joshua Oliver is full of cr*p!!!  Just because you were drunk and couldn't get food one night doesn't mean you should have a voice.  Go to Taco Bell...
This place had one of the tastiest burritos ever!!!  My wife doesn't even even like spicy, but the spicy mellowed real fast and settled into great flavor in just a couple chews.  I seriously need to travel this menu to update my comment.  (House burrito is what i had by the way. w/salsa verde.)<//Text>

Stupid good tacos. Located in plaza with a banner sign you can't really read right before the intersection. Try the mako shark. Beer battered was good too. Prices are average for this sort of thing. Only a few places to sit, small place. They say they'll move to OB at some point, at which point that place will kill it I'm sure. Bonus that they have a cooler full of Monster haha.<//Review>

I've been going to this place since damn near day one when it opened when the menu only had a few items and it was off the chain then and my boy who owns the shop took it to another level with what's he's added to the menu. Everything they do is straight fire from the 50/50 rolled tacos to the taco bowls! If you haven't checked this place out you're doing yourself and injustice by not treating yourself to the best Mexican seafood place out there! Btw people who say the staff are lazy are out of there minds, not once have I came here and felt they were lazy as my boy who owns this place not only bust his ass everyday but he holds his staff to the same standard!< /review>

We all know how google maps work when searching for a place. Though, don't let high reviews fool you, always visit them to see the location and talk with the staff in person.  Be kind and personable and you'll find out how they care about their work. Happy employees make for a happier business.  Anyhow.....

Upon researching online and visiting different Self Storage websites.... I've noticed there is a lot of online deals to be had right on their websites.  I narrowed it down to 4 different Self Storages. They all have very competitive prices online.  Though, one is way cheaper but does not compare to how well the other 3 maintain their properties.

Of the 4, I was able to narrow it down to just 2 Self Storages.  They both had great customer service, clean facilities, excellent security features and knew their business well.  Very close in rental prices online too.

Richard was helping me. Scott the manager, was helping another customer and I couldn't help but listen on the side. Great and awesome people!

Richard was able to answer all my questions and then some.  Security is top notch here.

- Vented outside air into their facility. I couldn't find a climate controlled Self Storage around due to my time constraint and wanted to stay in carlsbad by Palomar Airport.
- They do use a special kind of lock that is set inside of the roll up doors with star keys. No hinges on their doors for padlocks. Another added security feature.  I don't mind.... I'll use StorQuest again in a heartbeat.
- Customer restroom. Well taken care of
- Surveillance system
- Free carts to use to move your goods
- Large Elevators
- Main building has a covered loading dock
- Well maintained
- Clean. Inside and out. Just a beautiful location
- Boxes and accessories if you need to buy.
- Go ask them about different leasing times.
- They do have different tiers on access times.  No 24 hour access.

- Though you have to buy storage rental insurance from them or provide your own.  An added cost, but I didn't mind for the price I was given.

Do check them out if you are looking! Check out their website first for availability and call if you have any questions about StorQuest. I feel very safe here and for my stuff.

I've added photos and a few videos of this place

P.S. All their doors are in the process of a color change.  Don't be alarmed if their outside doors are red and inside is blue. They are in the process changing it all to red.</text>< Rate>

<Review>My experience with StorQuest Carlsbad was exactly what I had hoped for. I had no problem accessing my unit as much as I needed, and the managers at this facility were always extremely professional and helpful. Scott worked with me to identify a good location for my storage container for both moving in and moving out. There were no hidden fees, as Scott was very transparent about the costs upfront. I would absolutely store here again in the future.<//Review>< Pictures>

Had a great experience here and appreciate Richard’s patience and work ethic. Helped me immensely by staying overtime to help with last minute storage sign up. The manager, Scott, was also very helpful and provided great customer service. Definitely recommend this location.< /Text>

Scott Jedlick had handled our account from the beginning. His expertise, professionalalism, knowledge and friendly manner really makes a difference and is the deciding factor for our decision to use this StorQuest location. He is also the 'why' behind our 5 star rating.
This is now our 3rd year with StorQuest and we can honestly say it is because of Scott that we remain loyal.
With regards to the facility, it is modern, clean, bright, safe and convenient.<//Review>

I honestly have nothing bad to say. Your team was very helpful and polite and the extended hours worked great for me! I really needed that. The walk through was beneficial and the manager made things easy to understand-  glad we did that! Staff was always available too to answer my questions on site. Even on the phone- your staff was very respectful and knowledgeable about your place. Also, as a female, I felt safe staying there late, so thank you for that!  I would highly reccomend you guys! Many thanks!<//text>

StorQuest Carlsbad was perfect for what we needed. The place is clean, safe, and well-lit and easily accessible off El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road. Scott was helpful and very informative. I wish we would have made the decision to use StorQuest earlier.< /Text>

The manager, Scott Jedlick, is very personable and responsive, made our whole expericence renting two storage spaces easy. He really took care of us, and a nice guy! Had the lockers for over two years. The facility is clean, accessible, plenty of carts to move items from your car to your space. The storage facility is in a very nice business park in Carlsbad, very close to where I use to work.  Never had a bad experience with either the facility, management or other clients. Very reasonably priced as well given the location and shortage of spaces in the market.

When we did not need the lockers anymore due to a work relocation, Scott was excellent and took care of us. Five stars to the facility and the management, highly recommend StorQuest of Carlsbad!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>We’ve had a storage unit for about a year and never had any issues! The facility is clean and well lite, super secure and well maintained. We upgraded out unite to a 10x15 and their price is competitive with the neighboring businesses.
Scott the manager is amazing and helpful whenever we needed something!
Highly recommend this place<//review>< pictures>

Scott was professional, pleasant and incredibly helpful.  Very easy process.  Very clean location.  Competitive, if not the, best prices in the area.  I was at another storage company's location, which was filled with dust, debris and bugs. This place is CLEAN.  If you want your things safe and clean, this is a better choice.< /review>

I was looking for an easy and affordable storage facility near my home. Not only was this the closest, but lowest cost. Scott the manager was helpful and efficient at getting me a unit and explaining how everything is managed. The facility is clean, safe, secure. Now I can get both my cars in the garage!<//Text>

When I needed a unit that could also store a motorcycle they made sure I got a roll up door. I'd highly recommend if you do need storage.<//text><Date>1614392977923< /Date>< pics>

Richard was very helpful. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. I was in a hurry, so I told  Richard that I did t have time to look at the storage unit. He informed me that by law, he had to show me the storage unit before I sign on the dotted line. I was a little irritated, but due to the fact I needed a storage unit that day, I of course agreed. He told me that he would be quick and get me out of there as fast as he could, which I appreciated. Thank goodness Richard insisted on showing me the unit because I was shocked by how small it was. I appreciate the fact that  Richard didn’t cut corners, and actually did his job. And I also appreciate his promptness, because he did what he promised me; he got me out of there super fast. Richard ended up showing me a bigger unit and even though it cost my first born (aka super expensive) I decided to take it. The unit was more expensive than a number of other units I found. However, I felt a little better about paying more because for starters, all the security measure in place ensure that all the things I am storing in storage unit will be safe (knock on wood). Secondly, even though my storage unit was inside, on the second floor, I don’t mind paying more for accessibility. I was able to back my U-Hail a few feet away from the elevators and there are large  dollies/carts available if you need it. And I definitely needed to use them and it made things so much easier and allowed me to get everything stored and put away so much faster!! And lastly, I don’t mind paying more for great  service. Richard was so helpful and I appreciate him dotting every I and crossing every T to ensure that I was completely taken care of. Oh and by the way, Richard deserves a raise and a promotion.

Thank you!!< /Review>

<Review>I just got a storage unit here today! Big thank you to Scott Jedlick, the manager at the Carlsbad location, who made the whole process of getting a storage unit super quick and easy.

I just got a storage unit here today! Big thank you to Scott Jedlick, the manager at the Carlsbad location, who made the whole process of getting a storage unit super quick and easy. He had an answer for every question I had and was such a nice guy. As for the storage facility itself, the place is conveniently located in Bressi Ranch, right off of Palomar Airport Road. Everything is nice and new and the place is kept really tidy. The loading bay is covered and hand carts are available for easy loading and unloading.

<review>Scott Jedlick and Jessica, forgot her last name,  were very experienced in helping me decide which size storage to reserve for my house move out for our remodel.  Scott explained everything to me in an easy to understand manner, showed me the space and pointed out the features of the facility.  Jessica was also very knowledgeable about the facility and help me access my space the first time.  The security features of the facility were also explained and really sealed the deal.  I feel very confident our possessions will be safe and secure while we remodel our home.  I look forward to storing our things at StorQuest over the next year.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Awesome customer service, Scott is very accommodating and has let us change units several times (we needed more storage).

He was quick to take care of any issues re my storage unit and very helpful in setting me up with just the right amount of space for the things I had to store.

<Text>Hands down the best customer experience I think I’ve ever had... for real, no hyperbole. Super efficient, respectful of people’s time, and staff that listens and responds with actual solutions.

Scott (seriously the nicest dude ever) saw that I was on a time crunch. He and his co-worker went above and beyond to get me exactly what I needed and set everything up within minutes. True professionals</Text>< Pics>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I called more than 10 storage unit businesses to get pricing and unit information for a medium-sized unit.  With long-term or military discounts, StorQuest was by far the cheapest, saving me more than $300 in a year.  And so far from what I have experienced, the quality of service and professionalism is not diminished by the cheaper price.  Scott, the manager, and his associate Richard were amazing in helping us get settled into out unit.  Absolutely recommend.< /review>< Name>

Rented various units here for 10 years. Always a good experience. Scott is very proactive and responsive to any issues. I recently decided to close out my unit as I moved to a new place with lots of space. I hadn't realized that a 7 day notice to vacate was required and I was on the hook for the next month. Scott jumped in and waived the fee unasked. Highly recommended!</review>

Had a great experience with Storquest Carlsbad, had a quick deployment coming up, within a day I had my locker secured at a great price with the help of Richard and Scott! Was easily able to store all my essential items for cheaper then other storages I looked through!< /Review>

<Text>The StorQuest at Bressi Ranch has the most convenient location, close to both residential and commercial areas of Carlsbad. It is somewhat tucked away and has the feel of a secured place. It is clean and has plenty of loading carts available. I have been using it for a few years now and have always received great service. The store manager, Scott and his staff are friendly, communicative and helpful. Thank you!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>I don't usually like 5 stars reviews because they seem like they're from fake or insider or paid accounts to gush about a service.. but in this case it's warranted.

Scott is one of the most chill and professional people I've had the pleasure of doing business with. He was efficient in every way -- fast, thorough, and made the experience easy and enjoyable. Without a doubt a breath of fresh air. The facility is clean, safe, and well-kept, and the prices are amazing. I cannot commend Scott enough for his work and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.< /review>< gmapID>

Scott is an amazingly kind and thoughtful leader, and his customer service and expectations for the team he leads ensures that customers have a positive experience.

<rating>5</rating><Text>As someone looking to quickly source a space I was very much at the will of all the storage businesses in the Oceanside/Carlsbad area. And if you're currently doing research you know that the quality of storage businesses in the area aren't the best, both in management and pricing. I went to 4 different places between Oceanside and Carlsbad where I came across either rude/unhelpful management of exorbitant prices. Truly it felt I was going from one dirty used car salesman to another.

However, when I got to StorQuest in Carlsbad I was blown away by the employees and prices. I was helped in a way that made me feel as if it didn't matter if I was going to buy a storage unit or not, they were just trying to help solve one of my problems. Not only did they help source me a storage unit that was $30-$70 cheaper then any of the neighboring storage businesses but they also accommodated me closer to closing hours.

I would highly recommend this business and this specific location.</Text>< pics>

I stored my household items here for over a year. From start to finish... the service was great. I worked directly with Scott, the facility manager, from the beginning of moving everything in until vacating the unit. He was THE BEST. He went out of his way to help me find the best possible solution and explained everything thoroughly. And ... he treated me like a valued customer as much when I was arranging to vacate the unit as he did when I was arranging to rent it! I will definitely be back if I need to store anything again and highly recommend Scott at StorQuest if you have any storage needs!< /text>

<time>1577307825136< /time><Review>My schedule is very busy. I showed up at the StorQuest in the middle of the Manager's lunch. The closed sign was up but I didn't see it, and went in with the  UPS man.
The Manager put his lunch to the side, and went through the whole process  of helping me rent a storage unit.
I am very impressed with their level of security.
I have rented many storage units, this was by far the easiest process.
As I was leaving, two more people came in to rent a unit.
Even with being a very busy center, they gave great customer service.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I am doing some research on storage units in a couple of areas and Scott delightfully answers the phone and was very helpful, reassuring and spoke to many needs that I didn’t even realize I had. He spoke to many concerns that I had not considered and I really got that he knows people, our needs and what’s important to us as customers.

I have had a few self storage units in the past at other places and they were always just ok. StorQuest is extremely clean and very well maintained. They have risen the bar very high in comparison to other self storages. Scott and Richard know what great customer service truly is. If you are looking for the best self storage in Carlsbad, look no further, StorQuest is the way to go!<//text>

Great experience in every aspect.  Scott and Richard are both amazing and really made a difference in the company.  As packages were delivered they both knew me by name, called if there were any problems, and were very helpful in management of my storage unit.  StorQuest itself was a great facility, but I can honestly say that the way it's managed is the biggest difference.</text>

We just rented a storage space today from Scott Jedlick. He was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain their different options and how we would access our unit.  This place was recommended to us and would recommend it to any one looking for a clean, safe and reasonably priced storage unit.< /review>

Easily the best storage facility in North County. Premises is always clean and accessible. There are always plenty of carts for moving my items to and from storage. The staff member, Scott, is incredibly friendly and personable. He takes time to get to know me. That personal touch adds just that extra level of pleasant experience.

Facility is extremely secure, with several layers of access code. It’s the safest storage unit I’ve ever had. This is my second time at StorQuest Storage and I will never use another. I’d recommend anyone who needs short or long term storage to go with StorQuest here in Carlsbad.</text>

I signed an online lease with StorQuest which made the process quite simple, however they left lots of questions and didn’t have me fully prepared to start using the unit. Upon arriving to StorQuest I was greeted by the manager Scott and his assistant Robbie. Scott informed me he was on break but Robbie could assist me. However, Scott ended up taking the entire time to answer any questions and make sure I was comfortable with all of storequest policies. This type of customer service is not found in the storage industry, and I am very thankful for Scott and Robbie’s assistance.<//Text>

StorQuest is THE BEST self-storage facility I've ever seen or used. I moved from another location to StorQuest and Scott sealed the deal for me. He is professional, super helpful, made it so all easy! The facility is very clean, well-maintained - obviously very well managed. So happy to have found StorQuest!  Thank you Scott!</Text>

I got a reasonable deal on line and expected a haste on location. Richard was professional and helpful and supported everything we were told online.  So far all is great.  Only surprise is our lock from extra space does not work at storquest.  Expect to pay an added $21 for their lock.
When vacating unit i was told over phone cost would be prorated and I would be rebated for unused time i already paid for. They did not do that in reality.<//Text>

Hello,

I really didn't expect to receive the customer service I did. Scott Jedlick was amazing. He was so knowledgeable and took such good care of me. Its very rare to meet someone that you feel like your friends when the transaction is over. He is such a asset to your company and he made it easy.</text>

We were very pleased with StorQuest and have always received great service from the manager Scott Jedlick. We rented a unit for over 7 years and found the facilities to be consistently clean, easily accessible, very secure and a good value. Scott was always helpful and friendly whether we needed a cart or had a question. We highly recommend the Carlsbad StorQuest.< /Review>

Scott was great explaining the rules and property layout. He also helped me lock in the best price for my storage needs. The prepay option is great for those of us that plan on storing items for a set period of time. They also had the best advertised price of any storage company in Carlsbad! The facility is clean, quiet, and easily accessible. Very happy I chose StorQuest.< /Text>

<review>I looked at several several self storage facilities before I found Storquest.  This is a great location and is very easy to access.  But......  what really sets you apart from the competition is Scott.  You are very fortunate to have him as the manager.  He is absolutely amazing.   Richard is excellent, as well.  Always very friendly and helpful. As a former business owner, I understand how difficult it can be to find good people who care about the business as much as you do.  Scott has that true sense of ownership and pride in what he does , and that is such a rare quality in this day and age.  Make sure you take good care of him!!  :)<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Scott and Richard were both incredibly helpful. Richard made sure that I got the right size unit for me, walked me through the various procedures for security and understanding my locking mechanism, and was all around a pleasant guy to talk with.

The storage itself is kept incredibly clean and always has carts and other necessities for moving things to and from my unit. This is the only place I feel secure in storing my personal belongings.

10/10, would store again.</review>< Pics>

I have to start by saying that the last thing I ever want to do is move again… However in the last few years I’ve moved several times.   Scott has been amazing and put up with me the last few years! He has gone above and beyond and making sure that my storage experience was effortless and hassle free!  Scotts ability to genuinely care and accommodate my needs made everything so much easier! Even this last week when I had to cancel my storage unit because I ended up having a change of plans,  Scott went above and beyond once again and making sure that everything I needed was taken care of… Not to mention even offering to take my lock off my storage unit so I wouldn’t have to walk!!!!! I will definitely be coming back if I ever need storage unit again! Thank you again Scott for everything!<//text>

My husband and I stopped by after work on Mon 1/28 for a rental storage. We had already booked a space online. It was near closing time an the young gentleman helped us through a quick and easy process. He was very kind, informative and showed us every step needed to get to our unit. Would recommend! Thank you!</Review>

We did tons of research & visited all the other storage units nearby and this was the best choice. Clean, super nice management, high tech, but what really put it over the edge was the security. I am super pleased with their cylinder lock system. None of the others had this & it’s one of the most secure. So happy with this company. Scott, the manager, was so fantastic and helpful! He sat down and talked us through everything and answered all of our questions.< /Text>

Would give 10 stars if I could! You can tell when someone is perfect for their job, and manager Scott's professionalism and conscientious communication moved me to write this review. He and Caesar were so friendly and helpful from the beginning, and have continued to impress. The facility is state of the art and impeccably clean and so well maintained. But the way Scott goes above and beyond in making sure you understand everything clearly and making sure your individual needs are perfectly met takes the cake!< /Review>

Kat and I cannot say enough about the service we experienced at StorQuest last week.  Scott and his team were absolutely amazing; answering all of our questions and doing so in a respectful manner.  The banter was fun, and our goal of finding a safe, clean storage facility in the Carlsbad area was fulfilled!

Keep up the good work!<//Text>

Who knew you could actually have a PLEASANT experience at a storage facility??  The staff here - especially Scott and Richard - are always so nice and friendly!

Can't say enough good things about this location. Super modern, clean and the best rate in the area (I called over 10 others). Scott the manager is SUPERB, and went way above and beyond to make sure I got the best unit, best pricing and walked me through every detail. Richard was also super helpful. Some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. Thank you so much - you made this easy!</Review>

Scott and his team were amazing to work with! The customer service here was next level and the unit we rented was perfect for our needs. The site is very clean and I always felt safe. Scott went above and beyond to make sure we were well cared for. If you need a storage unit, you should absolutely check out the Carlsbad StorQuest.</text>

Starquest is a top notch organization Scott is my dude over there. I am on my second storage facility and I had such a good experience last year with my first larger one that I decided to consolidate and get a smaller one this year. I have had great help with Scott and with Richard and it could not be a nicer experience, I would definitely recommend this storage facility to anyone!</Text>

Scott, Richard, and the rest of the StorQuest Carlsbad staff provided excellent service throughout my 6-month lease with them.  They were engaging and always helpful, which gave me great peace of mind that my unit was safe and secure.  The facility itself was always clean and tidy.  I’ve used three different storage facilities in the Oceanside/Carlsbad area and this one has been the best.</Review>

This place is great!  I've rented from a couple of different storage companies in the past couple years but this one is top notch.  The facility is clean, well-maintained, safe and in a great location.  Scott (manager) was very helpful.  He clearly laid out the options and worked with us to find the one that best fit our needs, and has continued to provide great customer service throughout our stay here.  Thanks for everything Scott!<//Review>

Scott was more than helpful, he went above and beyond to find the perfect storage unit to fit my needs. Even with a lower than usual inventory of available units to choose from, he made it work for me! I couldn’t be more pleased with the service he provided and will recommend this location to all my friends. Thank you, Scott!<//Review>

<Text>The entire staff was always friendly, and helpful. The facility is always clean, secure, and worth every dollar spent.  I have used other nationwide storage facilities before, and StorQuest has been the overall best that I've used over the years! Highly recommended since 2016!

I need a storage unit unexpectedly at the minute and I went back to Storquest to see if they could accommodate me.  Thankfully they did, and was glad to see that Scott was still there and continued to provide 5 star customer service with a smile. I must also to give Kudos to Sam who helped me in every way possible in getting my account set up, as I had forgotten my reading glasses and was in a rush against the clock. Thanks again to Scott and Sam, you guys rock!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1554475410443, 'text': "Hi Sean, thank you so much for your positive comments about StorQuest Self Storage!

Scott the manager is very nice and has addressed several concerns of mine very professionally and gone out of his way to make sure I am a satisfied customer.

Rented here for 5 years. I tell everyone how clean it is and the Manager Scott is great!

I am adding that it’s been six years now with StorQuest and, as in the above comment, I would not move from there if I lived in Los Angeles!  Scott is meticulous in keeping the place clean and he is positive and thorough in the business end.  Both Scott and Richard are terrific.  If Scott moved to another store I would go with him. I have brought in a few customers since I have been at StorQuest and they feel the same.  Thank you.<//text>

I have been using the Carlsbad StorQuest location for a couple years. It has served my needs wonderfully as a temporary location for some belongings while I relocated. When I visited my storage unit, I was often greeted by the friendly staff. Scott stood out as an incredibly hard worker and was always able to help when I needed questions answered. He is truly an asset and one reason I didn't move out sooner. Thank you StorQuest and mostly thank you Scott.< /Text>

This is the second time we have rented a storage unit at this facility. We were happy 10 years ago and happy again this year. It still is as clean and "new" as it was a decade ago. It still looks like it just opened!
Even more importantly is the outstanding treatment we received from the building manager, Scott. He was warm, friendly and engaging. He gave us his full attention to our storage needs. It is such a rarity to receive such great customer service in this industry. We were pleased to find the ideal space for our needs and also so pleased to work with this great professional. As a REALTOR in the community, I will be recommending StorQuest to those who need this service.<//text>

When I arrived at the storage unit, Scott Jedlick was extremely helpful, knowledgable and friendly in assisting me with getting a storage unit. If I were to recommend any storage unit in Carlsbad, I would definitely recommend this one!</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This is the second time we have rented a storage unit at this facility. We were happy 10 years ago and happy again this year. It still is as clean and "new" as it was a decade ago. It still looks like it just opened!
Even more importantly is the outstanding treatment we received from the building manager, Scott. He was warm, friendly and engaging. He gave us his full attention to our storage needs. It is such a rarity to receive such great customer service in this industry. We were pleased to find the ideal space for our needs and also so pleased to work with this great professional. As a REALTOR in the community, I will be recommending StorQuest to those who need this service.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1519393161642, 'text': 'Hi!

<review>Rented here for 5 years. I tell everyone how clean it is and the Manager Scott is great!

I am adding that it’s been six years now with StorQuest and, as in the above comment, I would not move from there if I lived in Los Angeles!  Scott is meticulous in keeping the place clean and he is positive and thorough in the business end.  Both Scott and Richard are terrific.  If Scott moved to another store I would go with him. I have brought in a few customers since I have been at StorQuest and they feel the same.  Thank you.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This facility is the best storage place I have ever used. It is very clean and very secure. The staff is courteous and very professional. We have dealt with Scott Jedlick (manager) several times (first time was totally remote from NorCal) and he always goes the extra distance to make you feel comfortable and remove any worries. We will always use this facility for our storage needs<//Text>

<Text>Richard at StorQuest Storage/ Bressi Ranch was great today! He went over our lease option in detail, took us to see our storage unit and was very professional, patient, and detailed in explaining the process of entering the facility and utilizing the elevator and exiting. Our customer experience with Richard was excellent! His Manager Scott evening took time to say hi to us while we were in the office area. I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to bring your business here. The facility is clean and well maintained and secure. Thank you Richard for all your help today and welcome to Carlsbad !</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< name>

<review>We are just beginning our storage experience here. If the days ahead are anything like this initial experience, I am confident this review will never need amending.
The manager Scott was very thorough and patient. He explained everything completely and clearly. That is surprisingly unusual in this business. He gave us good advice and made no attempt to upsell or parade me through an endless array of packing and moving supplies. He also explained the contract and potential ways we might save money.  All that and he is a great guy.
This has already been the best storage experience I've ever had.

Ok, we had our precious belongings here for a couple months and my original review in the paragraph above this stands. Everytime I have visited my stuff the entire place is spotless and secure. Scott and Richard provided excellent customer service on our exit, and frankly, they are also nice guys.

I'm too old to put up with BS. This storage facility is top-notch and gives you a "no muss no fuss"

<Review>Easy online booking service.  The manager, Scott Jedlick, was very helpful and informative - he took the time to show us several storage options and explained several pricing options for longer term storage.  The units are clean, neat, well lit.

This is an update to a review a year ago - I just emptied out our unit after about a year's use.  Once again, Scott took the time to explain all my options on timing for clearing out the unit and made the process simple.  He then called to follow up to see if I needed anything else and has gone to bat for me to get a refund for the extra month plus I had prepaid.  I cannot thank Scott enough for all his help and professionalism.  He is always a joy to speak with and most helpful.  StorQuest is very lucky to have him on staff.  Thanks Scott!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1535862775848, 'text': 'Jean, thank you again for your kind review; we are happy to pass along your comments to Scott!

<review>I was greeted very nicely today by a gentleman by the name of Ron. I immediately asked for Scott as he has been my go to person for years. Ron totally understood and just so happened Scott was returning from lunch and was able to help me. I have had units at this facility for years in Carlsbad and have always totally loved this facility. It is perhaps the cleanest facility I have used. I currently have one in Oceanside and that is why I'm here today. There is not anyone  available to help me in Oceanside with my concers and it definitely is not kept as well as this facility so I'm here for another unit!!
Thank you, thank you for employing such great employees (Scott and Ron) and having such a clean and beautiful facility!!</review></record></dataset><record>

The office staff at the Carlsbad office are awesome. They go above and beyond assisting you with anything. I'm so fortunate that they had a storage unit for me. Will always recommend them to anyone I know that needs a unit. Thank you and have a great and blessed day.< /text>

I have rented a storage unit at StorQuest for the last 5 years. Scott, the manager, as well as the staff are friendly, courteous, and always ready to help. StorQuest is extremely clean, well-maintained, and safe, as well as security-minded. I have been very happy with StorQuest and would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Definitely earns 5 stars!< /Review>

So, we finally caved and got a storage unit after YEARS of debating and procrastinating.  We looked at the various options around the area, and StorQuest was by far the best.  The cleanest, most accessible, safest, and best customer service.  Scott was our rep and he was fantastic.  He showed us our options and helped us decide which of the available units were the best for our particular needs.   We feel really good about our decision!</Text>

The manager, Scott Jedlick, was very helpful and informative - he took the time to show us several storage options and explained several pricing options for longer term storage.  The units are clean, neat, well lit.

This is an update to a review a year ago - I just emptied out our unit after about a year's use.  Once again, Scott took the time to explain all my options on timing for clearing out the unit and made the process simple.  He then called to follow up to see if I needed anything else and has gone to bat for me to get a refund for the extra month plus I had prepaid.  I cannot thank Scott enough for all his help and professionalism.  He is always a joy to speak with and most helpful.  StorQuest is very lucky to have him on staff.  Thanks Scott!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

< Review>
I highly recommend this storage facility! Scott and Vince provide excellent customer service & communication. The facility is impeccably clean, the location is great and the hours work really well for my lifestyle. Pricing is competitive for other storage places in the area,  but I do feel I was given a good promo when I moved in. It's great to feel safe & secure while most of my belongings are being stored away from me. I love that they have motion activated lights in the building so that energy is conserved when not in use. I also prefer to frequent businesses who support our local troops and veterans and these guys really do what they can. (I'm from a military family but not in the service myself). Although I definitely don't want to store "my life" forever, I'm really happy with this place and will stay there as long as need be and recommend them to anyone who needs storage in North County.< /Review>

I am a retired Cop who was looking for a safe place to store my stuff. I want security, security  and morr security! When I arrived at StorQuest Carlsbad Scott and his coworker went out of their way to help me and address my questions about security. As it turns out this facility is built like Ft. Knox with many levels of security in place. A couple  of examples....the units are alarmed individually and only people renting on a floor can access that floor. I rented a unit. The application process was easy. I would highly recommend this place to keep your possessions safe.<//Review>

Over the years (and in various locales), I’ve had a number of storage units, and I can say without a doubt that my experience at StorQuest - Carlsbad / Campbell has been one of the best, if not the best, storage-unit experience I’ve had.

First off, this place is CLEAN! Other places just don’t come close to the attractiveness and cleanliness of this place. And second, and high up on the list: both the manager, Scott Jedlick and his assistant, Richard offer great customer service. Prior to getting this storage unit, I checked out several places (over the phone and in person). During this period (person and phone), I talked to both Scott and Richard and they explained things well and came across as very professional, plus the rate I was quoted was extremely competitive. I got a 10’ X 15’ unit with StorQuest that was less expensive that some other places’ 10’ X 10’ units.

I was a little hesitant about a second story unit, but Richard pointed out the dollies around the facility and with being able to park right next to the elevator (and with my unit being close to the elevator), I found that my initial fears were unwarranted. It was easy to access my unit, and to move things in and out of it.

At this place, they have you purchase a cylinder lock (~ $20.00 plus tax) to lock your unit. This is a very secure type of lock! In the past, at another storage facility, I had my lock cut open and my unit broken into. When I told this to StorQuest manager, Scott, he explained how secure and virtually-tamper proof these cylinder locks are.

There was one more thing that I really liked about this place: after punching in your code at the entrance, the buildings are arranged so that you drive (in one direction) in a big square and exit at the other side (where you again punch in your code for the exit gate to open). This seemed safer to me than cars and trucks coming and going in different directions, and like I said before, I was able to park right next to the elevator in my building. The driving space/path between the buildings was quite adequate so that cars and trucks could easily pass around cars parked to the side.

I had my unit at StorQuest for about 6 months until I could arrange to move my items out, and Scott was extremely helpful on my last day there (extending my gate access hours by two hours to accommodate my needs). If I ever need a storage unit again, and am in this North County area, I’d definitely use StorQuest - Carlsbad / Campbell again!< /text>

We've been with the Carlsbad storquest about 5 years, and rent 2 units. Today we called in, needing some assistance, and Ron stepped right up to do everything he could to make sure we had what we needed. He was particularly sensitive to our family crisis. To be honest, this 5 star level of customer service seems to be just standard operating procedure at this location. Over the years Scott, Vince, others, and now Ron have always been so willing to go that extra distance. This team has a remarkable dedication to customers, and we are so appreciative. Thanks so much!<//review>

<text>I highly recommend this storage facility! Scott and Vince provide excellent customer service & communication. The facility is impeccably clean, the location is great and the hours work really well for my lifestyle. Pricing is competitive for other storage places in the area,  but I do feel I was given a good promo when I moved in. It's great to feel safe & secure while most of my belongings are being stored away from me. I love that they have motion activated lights in the building so that energy is conserved when not in use. I also prefer to frequent businesses who support our local troops and veterans and these guys really do what they can. (I'm from a military family but not in the service myself). Although I definitely don't want to store "my life" forever, I'm really happy with this place and will stay there as long as need be and recommend them to anyone who needs storage in North County.</text>< pics>

He would always come out to greet me when I drove up and when I was moving my things into storage he made sure there was a cart available.

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I recently was looking for a storage unit in the area. After reading some bad reviews of other places I stumbled across StorQuest. The reviews seemed legit so I decided to give it a look.

This was the first time I have ever rented a storage unit and most people don't get excited about storage units so I was skeptical.

I walked in and was greeted by Scott. First impression was fantastic. He was friendly and helpful. He walked me to through the whole process. Then he walked me to the unit I was about to rent. The hallways were clean, storage unit was in great shape, the indoor units are air conditioned, and they have security codes to protect your unit.

The following day I moved my stuff in. I pulled up to the gate and he came outside and greeted me with a smile. The move in went seem less (even though I was on the second floor). Moved right in and left without any issues.

VERY happy with StorQuest. If you are looking for a storage unit in the area I would highly recommend giving them a look. Chances are you will also be impressed.

Thanks Scott!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I recently signed a year long lease on a storage unit with StorQuest.  Ron was the manager I worked with and he was fantastic.  He was knowledgeable, kind and professional.  I had several concerns about storage facilities in general, as I had surveyed many of them in the area.  Most facilities allow transients to make storage units their residence.  When touring such facilities, I personally witnessed transients smoking crack and letting their pit bulls run loose on the premises.  But, Ron made clear that they didn't allow such conduct on their premises.  He explained the top notch security of this facility and that they don't allow riff raff to inhabit the premises, which was of particular importance to me since I'm storing highly confidential documents.  No joke, I surveyed probably 20 facilities in the Carlsbad/Oceanside area and this is by far and away the best one.  Thanks, Ron!< /review>

Polite, helpful, respectful, informative, and especially not pushy from the moment I called until my rental agreement was signed. A HUGE contrast with other storage businesses in the area. They offered to reserve the unit I needed without a credit card for up to a week.

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>When it comes to storage, there aren't a lot of requirements (for me at least):
- accessible for long hours (early or late)
- clean
- secure
- not shady

StorQuest exceeded my expectations in all these areas. I was making runs late in the evening, which was helpful for my situation. Reasonably priced, close to home, very secure. They even have flatbed carts for use - which was super helpful. If I need storage in Carlsbad again, I'll go back here no question.<//review>< Time>

Storing my belongings at StorQuest Carlsbad has been a super positive experience. All of the units are easily accessible (even with BIG items) and super clean. On top of that the service I received from Scott and Vince was always professional and they always went the extra mile to make sure I was happy. I highly recommend StorQuest Carlsbad to anyone looking for storage needs.< /Text>

<Text>What a great place to rent a storage unit. Such a great location that is easy to get to. The facility is clean and tidy, and the unit we were shown( and rented) was spotless clean. The service is fantastic! Scott is super informative and really explains all of the processes very thoroughly. Thank you Scott for making the renting very easy, quick, and convenient!!!! Give him some more awards! He’s only got 3 different awards on his desk! His guy needs a freakin trophy room over here!!!!

<review>I've been working with Scott Jedlick since the beginning of 2016.  Scott has always, consistently gone out of his way to make sure all my needs and requests  were taken care of as soon as possible.  He is such a friendly, personable representative of Storquest and any company would be lucky to have him with his attention to detail, willingness to help and above and beyond customer service.  Both Scott and Richard always make time for me and are happy, positive people to deal with.  Highly recommend Storquest for all the security and especially for their staff!!!<//review><Name>Kim Johnson</Name>< Resp>

<Review>They are the best.

Temperature control very good (best I've seen); very clean; very well lighted; good fire protection system and policies, a modern, multi-level security system, close access to all units; and the friendly staff is helpful and efficient with whatever you need (specialty boxes, bigger unit(s), etc.).  I looked at half a dozen local places -- they all looked fairly good -- before choosing StorQuest -- it looked better -- and will definitely use them again if the need arises.  And best of all: You can look up (if you're outside) and maybe see a P-51 Mustang or a B-17, (but usually a corporate jet) less than 500 feet above you (it's just south of the normal Palomar Airport landing path, kitty-corner to the end of the runway)!  (Admittedly, if your boxes of old books and grandma's heirloom furniture is truly priceless to you, then for perfect security I suppose being nearly right under the approach to the busiest single-runway airport in the country is not a feature.  But if it means that much to you, you really need a different level of security/storage anyway! :-))< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I've rented from StorQuest for over a year in the past, and again setting up a new unit. They have the best facilities in the area and their staff are the most professional and helpful individuals I've had to work with. I highly recommend this company for storing your property.<//Review>

Storquest in Carlsbad is newer and very clean, which are a couple of the reasons I like it.  The staff, Scott and Vince are super friendly and helpful.  The hours are convenient and there are plenty of carts available to use.  It's very organized and getting in and out is a breeze.  If you're looking for a great place to store your stuff, this is it.</text>

<review>We rented 3 units from them recently and opened them with 3 different employees there, and found them all to be extremely helpful, knowledgeable, personable, friendly and professional. Scott, Isaiah and Vince are great!

We had never rented a storage unit before, so wasn't sure what to expect, but this place exceeded all of our expectations. Even with 3 units, we never had a single issue arise where we couldn't get in, find a cart, or feel insecure.

Safety and security were a prime concern of ours, and though no place can be 100% secure, we found this StorQuest to be in a good, safe area. The units are accessible only to patrons.

Cost-wise, it's very reasonable, and the guys will work with you to give you the best rate they can.

We highly recommend this facility.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Scott J was very helpful and very professional.  We liked that the entire location was clean.  Scott provided us with a lot of details and information of what StorQuest provides.  We like that there are hand carts available on-site and the ease of finding the individual units -- clearly-marked signs to guide you in the long hallways.  We were especially impressed with the security of every storage unit and the overall location.  Scott was very friendly and informative (answered all our questions) in rental contractual requirements, payment methods, access times, fire protection, and Storquest's elaborate security system.  He listened to our needs and what we were looking for, storage-wise.  Thank you to Scott, for the wonderful tour!  We were so impressed with everything that we signed up almost immediately.  The promo is nice, of course!   Thank you, Storquest!< /Review><user>112997472594579138308</user><username>C. HulseBus<//username>< response>

Scott, Vince and Ron have customer service down!  I have been renting from the Carlsbad location for almost 5 years now.  I am also a lifetime storage renter!  This weekend I needed another unit for my elderly mother who is leaving her home after 50+ years!   It is a moving nightmare!  I rented one size then needed a larger size the day of the move.  Both Scott and Ron took over made the change as seamless as possible, and were happy to do it!  Wish everything was this easy!  Thank you all!< /Text>

I know I am a stranger on the internet but if you are reading this and need a storage unit, stop and rent here. The facility is impeccably maintained, the security of the facility is top notch, and the staff is amazing. Scott is amazing, he personally saw to my needs and requests to ensure I was happy with my storage needs. I will tell you that I would not store my stuff anywhere but here. I am moving 40 miles away and if I ever needed a storage unit again I would make the drive, it’s THAT good. Honestly look at other storage places in the area and then look here, you will end up renting at Storquest it’s not even close.< /review>

<Review>Have a storage unit inside main building.  Told staff there was a problem with the lights around my unit not coming on. So I have to access things in the dark !!  Told them again - the response was that I need to walk around the corner to activate the sensors that turn on the lights.  Tried everything - nothing - reported it again !  AND again - Wake up !!! Are you deaf ?  Fix the damn light - I am fed up of having to use a flashlight.   Plain English does not work with the staff at this site.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been renting a storage unit at the Carlsbad location for almost three years and if I could give the I I I    I have been renting a storage unit at the Carlsbad location for almost 3 years and if I could give the manager Scott and the assistant manager Vince 6 stars I would. Both of these gentlemen go above and beyond with exceptional customer service. The facility is always clean and bright including the restrooms. The lobby is cheerfull and nicely decorated. If you are looking for storage units and a friendly staff this is the  place to rent one.

I just finished up my second experience with this storage facility and will plan to use them again.  They are always very helpful at the front desk and the property manager Scott takes the time to get the right unit and unit location for you.  This is a very clean facility and clean units that never have that musty storage facility odor.  Overall, I would recommend them to anyone wanting to have a professional property storage experience!< /Review>

<text>This place is clean and well kept and it was unfair of me to give Scott a mediocre rating.  He does a good job and will go out on a limb for his tenants.  What I didn't know about StorQuest is they do automatic rate increases, like everybody else, in certain months of the year.  To avoid this rate increase, the tenant can opt to pay upfront for a long term lease (6 mos.) to lock in their rate.  I don't believe other storage facilities offer this.  Based upon this new information, I have revised my rating to a Five Star.  This is a nice facility where you're stuff is safe and protected.
It's too bad there aren't more storage facilities to provide competition hereby keeping the rates low. Us Baby Boomers like to hold onto our old stuff in case we need to sell it to make ends meet.</text>< Pictures>

From time to time we must adjust rental rates to keep pace with the costs of maintaining a topnotch facility. We notify customers 30 days in advance to ensure they are aware of any changes taking place. However, we do offer long term discounts for customers who prepay six months to a year in advance, which locks in their rate for that period of time. We’d appreciate the opportunity to speak with you to gain a better understanding of your situation and encourage you to give us a call at your convenience 800-784-9176.'}< /resp>

I just finished up my second experience with this storage facility and will plan to use them again.  They are always very helpful at the front desk and the property manager Scott takes the time to get the right unit and unit location for you.  This is a very clean facility and clean units that never have that musty storage facility odor.  Overall, I would recommend them to anyone wanting to have a professional property storage experience!<//review>

I watched this facility get built from my nearby office in Carlsbad and soon became one of their first customers. I have always been impressed with their professional appearance, clean, pest free environment, well organized, brightly lit, very secure facility and ease of monthly payment. Scott Jedlick has always been there to help me with great customer service whenever I have needed assistance. There are other storage facilities closer to my home in Oceanside, but I am willing to make the drive to Carlsbad because Bressi Ranch Storquest is just THAT good.< /text>

<Review>I'm a longtime renter at Carlsbad Stor Quest (2009-2013) and am currently, almost 2 years.  Scott Jedlick has been genuinely supportive and gracious throughout this time, all the while maintaining a professional, effective office and making sure the premises are clean and functional.  Compared to other storage facilities I have experienced, Carlsbad Stor Quest is by far the best in every aspect....I attribute this to Scott's professionalism and work ethic.  Thank you Scott!</Review><resp>{'time': 1519922317265, 'text': 'Michael – thank you so much for sharing a little bit about your storage journey with Scott  at StorQuest Self Storage.

At the end of a 9+ hour day of packing, lifting, and driving, it is dark outside and all you want to do is be over with moving; you meet Scott Jedlick. What a refreshing surprise. I even called him prior to arriving to say we were going to be later than anticipated and he was so nice about everything. First off when you walk into the office, it is spotless, the bathroom is clean, holiday decor is up and Scott stands up and greets you, talk about amazing customer service. The storage unit we had was a little to small so he showed us another option and it was perfect. Being it was just after 5:30pm and he was about to leave around 6pm he advised that if we had any issues to call the emergency number. It was new place, first time seeing the premises and already I felt like he was a close friend. Though we may not be visiting our storage unit too much, I am so thankful to have met Scott and he just lightens anyones day, great customer service and goes above and beyond.< /text>

<Review>I can't say enough about StorQuest Self Storage in Carlsbad / Bressi Ranch.  What a first class operation!   When I visited, I was greeted warmly and professionally by Property Manager Scott Jedlick.   He made my decision to rent here so easy!  He couldn't do more to ensure all my questions were answered and that I had all the information I needed to make an informed decision.  The property is beautiful and I couldn't be more confident that my belongings are safe and secure.  In all my subsequent dealings with Scott and his staff, I always receive first class service.  Every interaction is a personal experience.  They care.  I can't say enough good things about his facility and how well it is run.  Anyone looking for a place to store their belongings should most definitely go to StorQuest - particularly Bressi Ranch.  There are many storage options but StorQuest is by far the best value I have seen for such a high quality, top of the line facility and operation.  Many thanks to Scott and his team for taking such good care of us!  These folks are clearly #1!  Exceptional!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Vince and Scott have now on multiple occasions gone out of there way to make my life easier. The units are super clean...zero odor. All the access points including the large elevators are secured with a keypad which takes some getting used to, but the locks are super easy once you get the hang of it and you always leave the place with just no worries that your stuff will be well kept. You can't go wrong here... true problem solvers.<//review><time>1466962261308< /time><name>Ted Ehr</name></record>

Scott Jedlick offers a great service along with the rest of the staff.  Not the lowest price, but sometimes you get what you pay for.  Always clean, neat and have had no issues with pests or damage.<//Review>< pics>

This is my third time I have rented from StorQuest. Once in Temecula with a 10 x 25 and more recently upsizing from a 10 x 13 to a 10 x 25 in Carlsbad.
The staff at both locations was very helpful and friendly at all times!
There are two things that would have made my experience with using them a lot more remarkable:
1) a trash dumpster. Bite the bullet you guys! People will take advantage of this and it will cost you some, but the amount of $ your company makes monthly, every month for very little work to keep customers coming back?
2) the monthly rent on the 10 x 25 in Temecula $241 and the same size in Carlsbad $370??? WHY and no returning customer break?
I will endeavor to get rid of all my storage possessions soon as I cannot justify this expense at 66 years old!

<text>StorQuest Self Storange, is without a doubt, one of thee most professionally/friendly run businesses that I've had the pleasure in patronizing.

Believe it or not, I had attempted to rent a storage unit, at the U-Haul facility right down the road. They didn't have any units available in the size that I was seeking, so their manager referred me to, StorQuest. IMO, this speaks volumes; the fact that the competition would recommend a competitior.

Reason's why I highly recommend, StorQuest:

1, Their staff. Both Scott, & Vince are extremely professional, & were ALWAYS a pleasure interacting with. The front office is immaculate, efficient, & highly organized.

2. Best bang for the buck! This is a 5 Star facility. My storage unit, was actually cheaper than U-Haul, & much nicer!

3. Meticulously clean (even their bathrooms;).

4. Awesome location.

5. Safe!

FWIW: I can only assume, that the CEO of this business enterprise, must have a degree in, Business Management. With that said, it's the intangibles (things you can't teach), that make a business outshine it's competition. SQ, is in a class of their own!

The highest recommendation: 5 STARS!!!!!

Thank you!
Sincerely, John Lee Smith< /text><user>105154775961337270766< /user></record>

<Text>Very impressed with this facility. Driving up to it I thought " this is going to be pricey". I was pleasantly surprised after inquiring within that they are not only competitive with other major brand storage locations in the Carlsbad area but even cheaper when you compare apples to apples- oranges to oranges. The location is perfect for the tri-city area (central Carlsbad) next to two major thorough fares ( Palomar Airport Rd. and El Camino Real ). The facility itself is state of the art as far as storage facility technology (climate controlled, entry gate and unit access security ect...). Most important for me is that it is fully fire sprinklered for fire protection. In the past I suffered a major loss of heirloom items in a storage unit fire in Henderson, NV involving about ten units which did not have any fire protection systems. Insurance covered the loss but most items were not replaceable. Lastly, a big thanks to Scott Jedlick and his staff for outstanding customer service and running a tight ship!< /Text>< pictures>

<time>1431389342983</time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I've had a lot of experience moving around throughout my career, and as a result, to rent storage units a number of times in the last 25 years. This is by far the best. I have been so impressed with StorQuest at Bressi Ranch Self Storage, and the manner in which they conduct themselves, their business and treat their customers. I have been a StorQuest Bressi Ranch customer/tenant now for about 5 years, and I must say, it's been the best experience that I've ever had with any self-storage organization, anywhere!  The facility is always clean, well maintained and looks great. Scott Jedlick and Vince are just top notch; always helpful, friendly and efficient. They go out of their way to make you feel at home, comfortable, and work through whatever issues you might have, to make your experience absolutely the best. Their customer service is nothing short of exceptional.

In particular, Scott Jedlick, the property manager, has been amazingly helpful.  He has helped me identify my storage needs and he always takes the time to explain my options. His terrific customer service is always above and beyond, and exceeds my expectations ... I don't know that I have ever had such impressive customer service with any company. I am blessed to have found this facility, and feel so grateful and thankful to have Scott looking out for my best interests.  I highly recommend this facility to EVERYONE who has storage needs.

We will continue to use Bressi Ranch/StorQuest Self Storage for all of our storage needs.
