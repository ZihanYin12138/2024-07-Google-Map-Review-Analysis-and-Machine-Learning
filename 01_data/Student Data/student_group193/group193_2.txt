I bought my corn snake and everything necessary from the inside of her cage to her food here.
It's always fun to check out their animals when they're busy assisting other customers. The attendants are patient and helpful, no matter who comes to you. I recommend going here for any reptile need.<//review>

The workers here act as if they know everything & discount your knowledge. I am a Cultural Anthropologist with a minor in Ecological Biology. I have been keeping amphibians for over 10 years. I just wanted to purchase something. the worker continues to doubt that I can keep the animal. Telling me over & over to research the species. I’m telling the worker & answering their questions about my enclosure. Do your job & sale the animals, I’m telling you I have an enclosure specifically for something. However, I need to continue to research. I’m done coming here, good prices don’t make up for multiple bad experiences.</review>

I’ve lived in Sacramento all my life. I’ve been into reptiles for 52 years of my young life lol😆I’ve met owners of local reptile stores past & present and Grant has been the most honest owner of all, as I can’t say that about the others. GX3 is the best EVER reptile store period. Knowledgeable staff is what you want when making a purchase. They’re be in busy for the coming years.< /review>

So a Chinese water dragon decided to wonder in my house last night. We decided that we wanted to keep him so we needed to get a whole set up for him since we have never owned one before. Went in today and they completely hooked it up. Everyone was very helpful and completely helped out what we needed for this little guy!<//Text>

<Review>Amazing place, I was skeptical about their old location because the animals weren’t in great conditions at all but they did a total 180 with the new location. The animals I got there are super healthy and active and they’re in amazing conditions. Staff was super helpful and friendly too.</Review>< pictures>

Visiting the area, glad I discovered this place. Very awesome place with a lot of assorted reptiles, most I've never seen in person before. The employee there was very helpful, answered a lot of my questions, and was willing to take time off of what he was doing to help me out.<//Text>

LOVE THIS PLACE their invert selection is like none other. Every animal is kept in a fitting enclosure (minus the snakes who need rehousing upon purchase). Lovely, beautiful Tarantulas, people are awesome, their bettas are well kept and GORGEOUS, their fish selection is small but awesome and dont forget to ask to see the monitors in the back ;)<//text>

Excellent communication, outstanding inventory for any reptile lover. I got a red tegu hatchling and it was healthy and happy form the get go. Got it home and he’s a curious one, checking me out, comes right to my hand and will let me pet him. They had everything I needed and then some, I’m 36 years old and I swear I was I kid in a candy store. Delightful place.< /Review>

Went to GX3 to geta chameleon and its supplies on August 8th. I was able to get most of it, but they were out of a lot stuff which means I had to run to another pet store on the bus to get the rest of it. In researching chameleons I realized he sold me the wrong light. On August 18th I called to see what their return policy was. He told me 7 days. He absolutely refused to extend it at all. Of course there was no manager or owner around. He told me he was sorry and when I told him sorry doesnt work for me he hung up on me. Nice customer service.. I will make sure I refer NO ONE there. The Serpentarium may be farther away, but they have more knowledge and far better customer service skills. There was NO reason you couldnt of extended it a few days. Learn better customer service skills.

Update- The owner Grant got ahold of me by email. He apologized for the way I was treated and is allowing me to do the return.</text>

Recently bought some new pets from the reptile expo here in Sacramento and I was in need of supplies for them. I tried other places before I came here and they wanted me to buy 500 dollar set ups. This store had way better pricing and a lot less pressure when it came to sales. The employee was able to help me find a set up that was perfect for my apartment and I was able to do it in my price range. I will be coming back here for future pet supplies over other pet stores. I highly recommend this place for your reptile and exotic pet needs.</Review>

Walked into the place a little small. The guy at the front desk was very attentive to our needs. We  needed medium sized live rats for our snakes. Very happy with the product. The prices are great. Will be going back there for all our reptile needs. On the plus side it's close to home.</Review>

A customer came in right before you and bought it (as you saw because he was checking out when you got there). Unfortunately I normally can do holds, but I was unavailable to do it for you this weekend due to my wife and I having our baby shower! I try to be as flexible as possible, but I would appreciate you taking your business elsewhere, thank you!"}<//resp>< Text>
If I could I wouldn't even give them a star. The customer service is horrible.  Yesterday I went in there with my girlfriend and saw an iguana she's been wanting. We couldn't find it anywhere. I asked the employee if I could put 30 dollars down and come back tomorrow to pay the rest. The iguana was 40 dollars. The employee said sorry but we dont do that...
But there were other animals on hold. I wanted to get the iguana for my girls birthday in 2 days.
So I get there later the next day to buy it and as I'm asking to buy it there is a couple at the counter purchasing it!!! Every other reptile place will allow you to put a down payment. Not here. Moral of the story... the customer service is ahit. I called the owner and asked for the hell of it if I could put money down if I wanted to make a purchase but was short on funds. He said yes.< /Text>

Small but very well organized and thought out.  I didn't get a chance to talk to the staff, but he did offer to help and answer questions.  They have a good selection of live protein choices for reptiles.
Will update after the next time we stop in.</text>

white variety of pets and food at very fair prices. I always go here to get a rat to feed my snake, and it's way cheaper than the frozen ones you can get at local chain stores. they also offer live prey, which is great because my pet is pretty picky and doesn't take frozen well.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Time>1572126533134</Time><text>Place was filthy! Pets look sickly. I saw two turtles flipped onto their back (one not moving) in a mulch filled tank. Turtles can not flip themselves over in mulch. I notified one of the employees and he said (with an attitude) “eh, they'll be fine”. I called before hand to see if they had a certain type of gecko, he said “oh yeah! We have tons!” They had two.

There were kids running around like it was a petting zoo.

If you are looking for a place to get a reptile, please go somewhere else. There are plenty of well kept places in Sacramento.<//text><Gmap_id>0x809ad1ca09104fd7:0xa8e1834811ed6a8d< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Bought my baby tortoise last week from GX3, Grant (the owner) is without doubt one of the nicest guys,knowledgeable, and he will help you after a purchase. Prices are more than fair
I would recommend GX3 to any serious buyer< /Text>

<Text>I can't say enough good things about this place especially the owner Grant. I bought a black and white tegu last year and I'm very happy with the purchase.  The thing that really separates this shop from any other in addition to the great selection and healthy pets, is the customer service you receive.  Grant the owner is very knowledgeable and has been there for any questions we've had before and after the purchase.   So these guys are awesome will definitely be using them and recommending them in the future.< /Text>< Pictures>

Only shop of it's kind in the greater Sac area. They carry reptiles and amphibians, with some Ball Python morphs available, lizards, monitors and tegus, tortoises and turtles, chameleons and even some spiders. They carry feeders both frozen and live for any and all repitle needs.  They're friendly and knowledgeable.

I also highly suggest reptiles as great pets for kids because they can be easy to care for with minimal work. They also help with building confidence in kids in handling them. They're also really fun to feed.</text>

Very Nice. Cherry on top for the hotel.  The Starbucks employee who selected this location must be credited with developing the idea.</review>

<time>1525037372661</time><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>This is a unique Starbucks just outside the SFO airport off Old Bayshore Highway with an ocean view of planes landing and taking off. It's located inside the Marriott hotel and isn't easily accessible to the public, unless one is willing to pay the Marriott parking costs ($7-23) or park in the street and walk 10-15 minutes. Prices are steeper than normal Starbucks (around 20-30% more than normal) but that's part of the cost for the unique location. It's also "special" in its own way in that they don't offer typical Starbucks refills and instead only refill hot coffee drinks.

Other than that, it's a very nice spot with comfortable indoor and outdoor seating. WiFi was adequate too, freely provided by Marriott with 2Mbps down and up.

I ordered a trenta strawberry acai for $6.21 that normally costs $4.72 and found it be consistent with other Starbucks.<//Review>< Pictures>

This was the worst Starbucks experience I've ever had. The bagels were listed as being $1.50. When we were charged $4 each we were told the sign was mistake. No effort to make it right. Before  8 a.m. I was told they had no decaf no coffee and couldn't do a poor over. They offered an Americano which I grudgingly accepted. There was virtually no coffee flavor in the drink I received. For the $20 we spent here today we will drive to find a better coffee shop.< /Review>

Tried to go here and they told me the Starbucks is closed until January 2019. They do have a pop-up non-Starbucks coffee shop set up off the lobby, but wouldn’t go out of your way to go to it unless you’re a hotel guest.</text>

<Text>They do not participate in the holiday tumbler where you get a free coffee for the month of January with the purchase of the tumbler. I brought my tumbler to this starbucks because of its proximity to my office. I would much rather go to this Starbucks but since my tumbler is useless here ill continue to go to the one on Broadway Ave for my usual.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

There isn’t enough stars to rate my experience with Carlos! He was super helpful, accommodating, and professional! If he isn’t the manager, he definitely needs to be promoted ASAP.  My family and I will definitely patronage this location again.< /Text>

Been renting for quite some time with PS and this establishment is always clean. I usually bring in big bulky items and their elevator is spacious enough for me to do so. I’ve recommended this place to a few of my colleagues! Awesome place to store.< /Review>

Great guy ,  helped me out , broke down every question I had about the storage first time renter so didn’t know much appreciated the fact he showed me two spaces to see which was better for me if I wanted to be closer to the elevator or in a open hall way so I don’t  have to Much trouble moving in big Items , made the process easy and fast thought it would take a while but it didn’t Overall 5 stars in my book manager name was Nick that helped me for someone fairly young great attitude and customer service highly recommended</Review>

Awesome place and great summer deals !!!! Must go !!!  Today was our last day to vacate our storage. Thanks so much to the staff Shantae & Abby  who helped us out tremendously. They made our process today of moving our stuff out smooth. From the moment we signed up to leaving they have shown us excellent customer service. I would most definitely come back to rent again in the future!!< /Review>

Me and my mom come here almost all the time and we enjoy the environment it is very clean and the people that work here are very friendly and helpful. Overall this is one of the best storage's ever. Venus is always there to make sure things are running smoothly, she has really good work ethic and does her job well. Whoever she brings in to work with her, I hope they do as good of a job as she does. Keep up the good work! (:</Text>

Me and my mom come here almost all the time and we enjoy the environment it is very clean and the people that work here are very friendly and helpful. Overall this is one of the best storage's ever. Venus is always there to make sure things are running smoothly, she has really good work ethic and does her job well. Whoever she brings in to work with her, I hope they do as good of a job as she does. Keep up the good work! (:<//Text>

This property is bad, Meaning that everything is always breaking down , as you walk the building you just smell fish or something that has rotten out , probably mold, due to the “Property manager “ not really doing anything all day mainly on her phone instead of doing her job. Will not recommend to anyone to store here .</Text>

So I had never even considered renting a storage space before and didn't really know how it went. I was really fortunate to have Deandre at Public Storage answer all of my (long and stupid) questions so helpfully. As it turns out I didn't need a space, but I did buy boxes n stuff because Deandre rightfully pointed out that I shouldn't just be laying my expensive s**t around in the spare room. So now my things are all protected. Thank you Deandre and thank you Public Storage!</text>

<text>First time using Public Storage, and Ruben was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. But most importantly, Ruben went above and beyond his duty when he stayed over 45 minutes past the closing time to help us finish our move. We were very impressed that he would do that for us and offered him a small tip, which he refused - That showed character and honesty, traits that are hard to come by these days. Because of him, we strongly recommend this place. Reserve your space online and more importantly be sure you ask for Ruben.< /text>< Pics>

Aaron was amazing and made me feel really comfortable with this space. Being super stressed with moving he was making me smile and made it very quick and easy to get this unit. By far the best service at a storage unit ive ever had! Thank you Aaron for making this experience pleasant.</text>

Aaron was very professional, well spoken, and courteous. He took his time explaining everything pertaining to the storage unit. He also presented additional moving supplies, that are essential for my family's moving needs. This storage company is a one stop shop!</Text>

Came to this public storage just had a couple questions about storage , didn’t know what size , how much I needed to start or anything ! I must say the manager nisha made me feel welcomed with her gorgeous smile , she didn’t hesitate to show me different storage sizes , facility was also clean . Public storage gained a new customer ! Keep it up girl !!!< /review>

Some of them were good and some of them bad.  However, I would say the representation at the Public Storage in Hawthorne (off Crenshaw/Rosecrans) is THE BEST of all... Especially Venus.  She's not only a nice lady but always very helpful and professional.  She makes my experience at Public Storage very pleasant and I will definitely recommend her to anyone in need of a Public Storage space.  She's the BEST!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>This is by far the best Public Storage place I have been to! The facilities are extremely clean. The layout allows for easy access to your storage unit, which makes moving in and out extremely simple. They even have carts that you can use at any time. Best of all is the customer service! I had to move everything into storage on Monday. However, with LA traffic and construction on Crenshaw Blvd, I would have never been able to make it before 6pm. Vanesa offered to stay a few minutes after to wait for me and make sure I was able to get my storage unit before she closed the office. Even though she was after hours, she provided the best customer service. She thoroughly answered all of my questions, let me check out a few different units, and was friendly, patient and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this facility. Thanks again, Vanesa!<//Text>< rate>

Julian was perfect with customer service. I know I was a pain, but he made my moving experience feel at home. He handled all of my needs with flying colors. He is the very best!! Although the inside of the storage room was not very sanitary, in fact i rate the storage room itself a zero due to all the roaches inside. They were all inside of my boxes. Smh. THUMBS DOWN! I rate Julian a A+.< /text>

<text>Having a storage space was one of my biggest pet peeves because it was an extra expense in my eyes. But I must say Deandre was always pleasant when I came in the office and always went above and beyond to help me in spite of my attitude. So thank you again<//text>< pics>

We went for an item and they were out of stock. But the cashier/supervisor was incredibly knowledgeable on when the product would hopefully be back in and he also told us that he called another harbor freight (in La Habra) a few days ago and he told us that they had 300+ in inventory of it. That was absolutely outstanding service.<//Text>

First experience at this location was great. I generally visit Anaheim location, which reported item out of stock online and only whittier having in stock. Staff were very friendly, and very helpful. The item in question was not in stock on floor and I was quickly asked if I needed assistance. They checked stock and had the item available, bringing directly to check out while I continued shopping. I also learned the online inventory was only implemented a few days prior and was still subject to discrepancy.</Text>

The tools are much cheaper than Lowe's and Home Depot. It not as big as the two but there are a lot of items that is always on sale. That is why I became a regular customer.</review>

It's a great place for typical consumers to get tools and equipment at generally very low prices. It's not a place for most professionals and business that will heavily use the tools or put them through hard tests. Many times as a typical consumer you only need some equipment for a specific project or task and may only use it again every few months or years. This place will usually have what you need. Be aware that not everything is a great deal, especially when you consider quality, value, and durability, but I've generally been pleased.<//Text>

Low price tools! The majority of which have lifetime warranty so long as they are hand tools. Most of the electronic type tools are 90-day limited warranty. The employees here super chill and will help you find what you're looking for. Lots of people use this place as a tool rental place: Essentially buy what you need to get the job done and then return it and get your money back! Kind of screwed up but it's not against their policy lol. The line of tools by baauer: such as impacts & hammer drills and stuff like that, are actually pretty damn good, give Makita a run for their money @ a fraction of the price.</review>

Always a pleasure shopping there. Just keep noticing that everytime I go there prices are higher then the last time I was there. In some cases as much as 30% higher.< /Text>

The vets & staff at Memorial Beach were able to find her an appt quickly, and when the avian specialist she was schedule with had an emergency and couldn’t make it, they quickly let me know and found another vet with avian experience to see her the same day.  I appreciated the professionalism and care for my time and my pet.  They did a great job treating her injuries and the cost was very reasonable.

I have pet rats, and it is near impossible to find a good vet who will treat them. Dr. Marty is incredible. She makes you feel heard and valued, and always includes you in decision making about treatment plans. All of the receptionists and techs are amazing as well, making an effort to remember your pet's name and reasons for visiting. Really, all of the Memorial Beach Vet Staff make it so going to the vet is actually sort of enjoyable... They are very personable and professional. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!< /review>

Dr. Marty has taken care of our cat, Peaches & Cream, since we brought her home in 2014. She and the staff have taken excellent care of a kitty who doesn't like going to the vet. Best vet clinic I have ever known.< /Review>

<review>I am very grateful to the staff at Memorial Beach Veterinary Hospital .  They have been caring for my four legged family members for over 20 years.  During that time some staff have left, and new staff have been hired.  The changes in staff have not diminished the level and quality of care.
I know  that my pets will receive absolutely the best care.   When we walk through the doors of Memorial Beach Veterinary Hospital staff immediately focus attention to the needs of my pet.   On many occasions I have received training and information necessary to provide my pets with the best care at home.  They work with me as a member of the treatment team.  They are available by phone to answer and address non-profit emergency situations. The care received is not just preventative or medical. They've helped with behavioural issues, pet sitting needs, grooming, dental and dietary.
Each pet has a designated vet, which help my pets establish trusting relationships and reducing anxiety.
If I could rate my experience one to ten, they would get a 20. Absolutely AWESOME.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8084172378416969:0x937ae3f206dbc234< /GmapID></record>

I am new to Memorial Beach Veterinary. Our pet rats were coughing and having trouble breathing. I've used other Vets in the past that I wasn't impressed with. This office was friendly and Knowledgeable and got the rats on the road to recovery. I highly recommend them. They got me in right away also.<//Text>

Thank you Dr. Marty, Cathy, Debbie, Kendra, Debra and all the other angels at Memorial Beach for taking such tender loving care of Yum Yum and Yin Yang from their very first puppy visit almost 13 years ago Mother's Day (born) til Yin Yang's very last.  All of you made it so loving and peaceful for Yinnie, Yum Yum and me.  Also we hold a very special place in our hearts for Cathy for what she did for Yin Yang at the very end. We know it was difficult and we will always be grateful for her.  All of your actions come from your hearts and is something special and seldom experienced at other vets..  Thank you for being there for me and being our vet.</review>

Memorial Beach Veterinary staff and Dr. Marty cared well for three golden retrievers (Syd, Ben and Abbie) and two cats (Betsy and Quincy) throughout their lives. Now, we have just one cat, Sasha - age 10. We trust the  professional staff and know our pets will  receive kind and  caring treatment. Dr. Marty is focused, never in a rush and answers all questions. We so appreciate the wonderful care they've provided to our cats and dogs over the years. Walt & Barbara G</text>

Even though we moved from Healdsburg we still make the drive because we just can't imagine taking our pup to anyone else. They're the best.< /Text>< pictures>

They go the extra mile to ensure that not only your animal family is ok but you as well. Over the years we've brought all of our fur babies here. When one would pass they would send a card tell you sorry for your loss. So if you want to be treated like family and have great pet care come here.

My cat was having some eye irritation so I took her into Memorial Beach Vet Hospital.  I couldn't have been happier with the staff.  From start to finish everything was just great.  Dr. Lauren Marra is a very kind soul on top of being very professional, helpful and communicative.  I felt like my cat and I were surrounded by love.
My cat's eye is already better and we will be back soon for her booster shots.  We will definitely be back as regulars!< /review>

We love Memorial Beach Veterinary Hospital, or, I should say, our dogs love the staff there and that makes all the difference!  Drs. Martie and Cheryl are wonderful!  They explain everything and are very compassionate.  If one of our pups is seen at another hospital or vet, one of their staff,or they, call to acknowledge the incident and to check on the pup.  We love them!<//review>

I have been using MBVH since I moved to the area late 1998. They stay current with the latest trends, medicines, etc. The veterinarians, the techs, and office staff have always been understanding and helpful.  They are willing to work with you when you have the occasional bump in the road.  Dr. Marty and Dr. Cheryl have been fantastic when I had a house of "senior" citizens.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This will be my vet office of choice for life. I've been bringing my dogs her for for around 4 years and they have always been very helpful and very fair. I have always felt that the doctor's care and have always given good advice and made good and knowledgeable assessments. If your looking for a place that truly helps and care look no longer.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Everyone at Memorial Beach Hospital has always given the absolute best care to my little monster, Mr. Clyde. We both appreciate the level of attention he receives and for putting up with the little (lovable) monster. Much love and thank you for all you do.......Jeffrey & Mr. Clyde<//review>

BEWARE!!! Careless and incompetent. They are directly responsible for my dogs death because they didn’t pay attention to the blood work THEY did on him.

Considering their high fees you would think they would at least pay attention to their work.  Please  Find someone/ anyone else to care for your animal.</review>

<Text>We've been taking our pets to Memorial Beach Veterinary Hospital for as long as they've been there.  They go out of our way to be sure our pets are well taken care of, to the point where "Cookie", one of the original vets, called us in Switzerland to tell us our Corgi had mammary cancer and needed immediate surgery.  Now that's service!< /Text><rate>5< /rate><user>114685027371337750185</user></record></dataset><record>

They are very caring and knowledgeable. However you do I feel pay a premium for taking your animal here. Pricing seems to be higher than other vets in the area.</text>

My dog, Cooper, and I love Memorial Beach Veterinary Office. Cooper can hardly wait to get in the door. Once in the door he is given lots a love from the desk gals, vet techs, to the doctor. I am forevever grateful for the wonderful care they give to Cooper to make sure he is healthy.<//text>

Everything was great, as usual! My dogs and I love Dr. Jorgensen, and our vet tech (Vanessa?) whom I hadn't met before, was awesome with my two dogs! Dogs living a farm life face different issues than city dogs, and I always feel they understand and address my concerns.  I always recommend MBV to all friends!< /review>

He didn't come out as groggy or wasn't sulking like other times. Thank you Dr. Marty for taking such good care of him ☺<//Text>< Date>

< Review>
I live in San Francisco but make the trip up there because ....first I love Healdsburg ...but also because I love this place! You not just another person walking in the door, you are almost like family. They all care for the animals and it shows the minute you walk in the door. I can say I feel that my dog Asics is in the best care when i bring her here. I have many choices in SF but I decided what is best for Asics is Memorial Beach Vet!< /Review>

<Text>Brought my Lab and Yorkie to get tested for heartworm. Our Lab was fine and our Yorkie had it! After a whole explanation on how serious his condition was already; they gave me a quote for $1,200.00 (based on his weight; he weighs 5.6 pounds) to do the blood work and two treatments. I decided to get a second opinion with Dr. Baldwin down the street. His quote based on his weight for the same treatment and blood work was $380.00. Unless you don't mind getting charged 3 to 4 times more for any treatment; don't go to Memorial beach.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Being I have been with Healdsburg Memorial Beach Vet since 2006, I can highly recommend them - and especially now, with their current staff of which most have been with HMBV for as long plus.  Dr. Marty is our vet now, and she is fabulous - very personal, but more importantly is constantly in a research capacity along with attentive veterinarian care.< /Review><Name>Kitty de Brauwere</Name><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The most amazing vet I've ever come across. My very elderly chicken Lovelace was suffering from a severe prolapse, but I was able to get her into Memorial Beach Vet only several hours after I called them and relayed how serious the situation was. Dr. Lane is absolutely incredible and was so helpful, responsive, and kind throughout Lovelace's entire healing process. Every staff member I interacted with was warm and welcoming, and everyone treated my bird with more gentleness than I've ever seen with any other vet I've taken a chicken to. I will be going to this vet for any animal that ever needs care in the future!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3Y1DVyJPeK_Y9HMCKUdAgAM1wkqJ1wF5VcgZ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>I had a wonderful experience today as my first time as a patient. Acacia Mason was absolutely fabulous. She is the reason I joined the wellness program. She has confidence, knowledge and holds a genuine demeanor. 100% satisfied with my care today. The receptionist was absolutely outstanding as well. Very sweet and professional!</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I had been suffering discomfort in my hip for about one week. I visited The Joint because I live near and had seen the sign. I’m glad I did.  I was greeted right away. I was treated respectfully by friendly and professional staff. Step by step description of the recommended treatment and process was thoroughly explained to me. I followed prescription and felt better right away. I am now maintaining my progress and very grateful I found them.< /text>

I had been searching for a great chiropractor for years and after one adjustment here I didn’t have to look anymore. Dr Acacia is amazing! She fixed my back pain in just a few treatments. I love that she adapts her techniques based on the patient’s needs. Lisa is so friendly and helpful. Great chiropractic care, great people, great price!</Text>

My experience at The Joint has been wonderful. The staff is kind and welcoming, and Dr. Acacia’s adjustments are gentle but effective. I could hardly walk because of low back pain 10 days ago, and the improvement is dramatic.<//review>

The doctor is lovely, but I wish there was more non-axial adjustments available. I also have noticed that one of the reception persons doesn't wear their mask properly and the doctor allows patients to be unmasked in the service area, which, especially given the development of covid variants, I find incredibly disrespectful and unsafe.</Text>

Such a friendly, friendly team. I arrived basically at their lunch break but had driven furiously to try and make it for treatment and they were kind enough to put aside their lunch to treat me and help me with my pain. Simple human kindness but also excellent therapy and highly recommended. Thank you!</review>

But I guess that is the exchange for affordable care. I've been back 3 times since the review below and 2 times the wait was 30mins and an hour. I think I need to get there like 30 mins before opening or something.

However, if time isn't an issue for you here us my review for the service itself is 5 stars. My first time here was a great experience.  The front desk was lovely and the Dr was amazing.  I only had one issue. The wait time. I came in a Monday. And the front desk woman even apologized for the wait, she said that its never THAT busy and I guess the fact that there were about 4 or 5 new people in that one afternoon was out of the norm. I waited close to 2 hours. I didn't care so much as I had nothing to do that day. But it's the main reason I haven't been back. Dont get me wrong I want to go back but the idea of waiting really turns me off. I'll eventually go back and I hope that by not being a new customer will help the wait time. Overall it's the reason why I give a 4 stars instead of 5. I can't imagine waiting like that ever time I go in. And if it the case I really wish they had appointments.
I'll re review the next time I go.<//Review>< Resp>

<review>Wonderful experience. The staff was knowledgeable, and professional. My adjustment went very well. The Doctor was well informed, and answered all of my questions. At the end of the session I was offered a 2 month membership. 4 visits a month for 2 month's at a very reasonable price, and accepted the offer. I highly recommend The Joint Chiropractic.< /review><userid>101559965329894305594</userid><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>This was my first time at this location but I’m working on an ongoing back issue. The woman at the front desk was extremely friendly and fun to be around, and Joe not only did a great adjustment but gave me new information about the source of my tightness and some home exercises for it. This was definitely my best chiropractic experience so far and I would recommend it to anyone!< /Review>< rating>

<text>My wife visited the Joint one of the first days they were open, at that time they were giving free adjustments. When she came home she raved about it. After some  discussion, she talked me in to going. I was so glad she did! We even sighed up for one of the care plans, I have gotten great results! I tell everyone about Dr. Joe and how he helped me and my wife. I can only say the Joint is GREAT!< /text>< Pics>

My first time here. I needed an adjustment badly after being absent from regular chiropractor maintenance for a chronic issue. The staff  were extremely professional and personable. Made me feel comfortable and well taken care of.  My adjustment was fantastic and made a huge difference in my well being. I highly recommend and I will be back . Pun intended. !,🤣</Text>

<Text>The staff here were excellent. The gentleman at the desk was polite, friendly, and unusually efficient. He made everything easy and pleasant while I completed the signup process. The chiropractor was amazing. He helped me more in 20 minutes than anything I've tried for 3 years. He was kind and confident and I felt like he was in control of what he was doing at all times. Also the prices are incredibly low if you use their monthly plan. I can't recommend this place enough. A cut above in quality at a lower price.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>I’ve been suffering a shoulder injury for over a year and had gone through BAD expensive chiropractors, traveled over 400 miles multiple times just to find relief. I also tried my best to explain to the doctors about the issues, but it seemed like they weren’t listening. The attitude I got from them was to throw me on a cortisol program for a week after I explained what muscle it could be and how it happened.

To make this long story short, my wife and I were desperate and got tired of seeing me suffer, so she Googled chiropractors local in the area and found out about “The Joint Chiropractic”. I was expecting another bad experience, hence the situations I’ve been through, but Dr. Joe definitely proved me wrong. I was also surprised by the price considering how much relief I got after just one session! I paid thousands of dollars with other chiropractors in the past and none of them were even close to what Dr. Joe did. Plus no appointment needed to get treated here as they accept walk-in patients!

Dr. Joe listens to his patients and does the best he can to get the proper adjustment they need. It was definitely a life changing experience and I highly recommend them to anyone who needs chiropractoc care! Thanks Joe!< /text>< Date>

<text>I've had worsening back problems for 15 years, and yet to find a Dr. who can actually give me an explanation as to why. Upon entering the Joint, I was able to describe my pain and was given an answer I had never heard of before, and one that finally made sense. The 2 problems I've had over the years has been finding an effective Dr. and one I can afford. I've FINALLY found the answer with The Joint!! I can finally get help when I need it and can AFFORD to get help when I need it, AND I can afford regular maintenance to try prevent problems before they happen. After only a week of membership, I feel better than I've felt in a VERY long time, and I am so very grateful!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1605647426161, 'text': 'Thank You for the awesome review Rinah.

<Text>Great place! Couldn’t recommend it more if you are having back/ neck or shoulder pain like I was. Have been going for almost 3 months now and has helped me athletically by eliminating imbalances that I had and also keeps me sleeping through the night now that my neck doesn’t have a huge knot in it thanks to dr ace. The gentleman and gentle lady that work at the front desk are super helpful as well with all the information you need and also have been very flexible with me during COVID/ fire. They clean after every patient. All around great place ! Try it</Text>< pics>

Not the best adjustment I have had from the joint. Stopped by because I haven't been to my usual joint location and needed an adjustment. Doctor couldn't crack my neck or back to relieve tension on my back and neck.< /review>

Joe is great! He has a great way of explaining what he is doing and why. I have also had one other Chiropractor that I had a great experience with. I always leave feeling better than when I arrived. I can't recommend them enough.</Text>

<Text>The staff at The Joint in Santa Rosa are excellent!  Dr. Joe is the best. I’ve been a long time user of chiropractics, and I’m currently 7 months pregnant. Having regular adjustments have been clutch.

Dr. Davi is both surprisingly affordable and capable. I've seen four different chiropractors over the years. I'll admit I was skeptical at first because he is young, but he is the most knowledgeable I've encountered so far. He can pinpoint areas of need without the need for an expensive x-ray or randomly shoving areas of your back to see what moves. He's the kind of doctor that probably got straight A's in school. He's nice and humble to boot! Get him while he's cheap, cuz this guy will cost a fortune to see 10 years down the road. Worth every last penny.</Review>

Dr Joe is great. He identified my problem areas and has been a huge help in relieving my stress.  I love the “no appointment” concept.  Dr Joe and his staff are always friendly and professional.  I highly recommend The Joint.</Text>

Walked in with extreme back tightness and walked out with no more back tightness and pain, wow!   I totally understand what the problem is now.  My medical doctor tells me it's because I'm aging and didn't fix anything.  Dr. Davi fixed it with a treatment plan.  I'm convinced.</Text>

I practically had to beg for a manual adjustment, then the effort put forth was that of a put-out teenager. My back still hurts and I'm never going back here. What kind of chiropractor can't pop a back?</Text>

The Joint is  great with diagnosing the issues,  explaining what is going on,  and then correcting your issues.  Glad they have moved into north Santa Rosa! Highly recommended to anyone experiencing back and or neck pain!< /Review>

Very efficient operation, and the doctors are very caring and professional. I go every week. Unbelievably fast to get in, just swipe the card and go back. Almost never a wait, and any wait is brief. This is chiropractic of the future!<//review>

<Review>Not all McDonald’s are the same: this one is better than all of the rest. Perfectly cooked filet-o-fish. Nicely seasoned crispy fries. A quarter pounder that doesn’t give you stomach problems. To top all this off, the people serving you were some of the friendliest workers I’ve ever encountered at a fast food place. I highly recommend coming here!!</Review><gmapID>0x80c29e6437da2abb:0xc1973f0299c47422</gmapID>< Pics>

Just wanted a sandwich, on the way to a movie. I'm not much of a fan of fast food, but this is open all night & so close to home. Nothing new to report...it's a good McDonald's. Quick, clean, hassle-free.< /Text>

<review>I agree with most of the other reviews about rude and bad service. Staff is rude and not helpful. Managers are the worse. Their stingyness know no limit. The look on their face when they have to give complimentary sauce or free cup for water. 😑Never smiling. Always lying about free deals and free small soda with mobile order. I literally went to another McDonald’s same day to check and they gave me free soda with mobile order. Gave this store multiple tries but always the same bad vibe. 👎❌Avoid at all cost. 🚷</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c29e6437da2abb:0xc1973f0299c47422< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Southward-facing patio is clean and sunny and perfect for a little coffee and a nap after a hard morning trail running or cycling. Service is excellent. Food is great. Recently refurbished. Good location. Well appointed interior. You can order from a kiosk within the restaurant if you want. Certainly there were no lines in evidence while I was there. Excellent. 5 Stars.<//text>

Awesome and clean McDonalds. They've remodeled it a lot to always keep it modern and they are open 23 hours a day. They close from 4am to 5am sometimes and holidays.<//review>

I order some food, only got half. Then after calling the restaurant 4 times got nothing but a voicemail. Furthermore I tried to get a refund or the rest of my food and they said they couldn't do that without a receipt. The lady told me it was in the bag yet it is nowhere to be found. I know this is fast food but come on I'm fed up. Literally not physically -_-< /review>

This location is by far the most unprofessional Mc Donald's I have ever experienced. I have been coming here for months now. Almost every single time, something is wrong with my order. I sick of it. Ask a simple question and you will almost always get a bad attitude. Get ready to wait, chances are that even for a burger and fries they will make you leave the line and wait in the parking lot for your food. I have NEVER waited less than 10 minutes, even when there is no one else in line. This location needs some serious work.<//review>

<Text>I wish I could eat Mickey D's every day. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Like I want to eat it every day until I have clogged arteries and diabetes and have to scream at my wife to come help me up off the sofa. But I don't, cuz I know thats bad for you. Seriously don't eat it every day. But man when its time to finally cheat and have a delicious McChicken and a medium fry this is the place.</Text><pics>None<//pics><user_id>115409807134726825075< /user_id>< GmapID>

The service was the worst.
One of the workers was very unrespectful when we asked why the whole McDonald's was so cold
Asking for they to turn on the heater .
And they replied that they can't do it that is automatically
That is called thermostat not working
Fix it and learn how to talk respectfully to customers</text>

Do not like the new decor. Cashier was nice, friendly. The management looked miserable. Took about 11 minutes to get our order. The sweet tea is my favorite McDonald's item and that was terrible! Taste like sugar water with a bitter aftertaste. Thank you<//review>

<review>They close at random times at night even though it says 24 hours. They’ve gotten my order wrong at least 3 times one time ordered a quarter pounder, got home opened the bag and was a fish filet... like come on. Sometimes the food is fine but it’s just not a reliable McDonald’s. Just go to the one off las virgenes or topanga. This Woodland Hills one just needs some work.</review>< Rating>

Horrible I went to get food after a late movie . First the manager tried to shot change me of six dollars. After I brought it to his attention he never apologized and appeared to be upset that I confronted him and I ask for a decafgonayed drink and he said all he had was ice tea and it was not tea but a coffee / tea mixed . The food was horrible including the fries which are always delicious. I coul not eat the food and definitely watch you change<//Text>

Arrived home and find that they give me a complete wrong sandwich plus the apple pie it is cold and frosty in the center try to call for have an explanation but
Nobody answered my call
6 call.....phone ring 20/30 each time
Nobody repeat nobody answered there's not exudes for that!!!!
This is to be a worst service ever
I have the similar problems at the McDonald's in las virgines road
And I never went back
I will give a chance to this one more time but after one more problem
I'm done with McDonald's
Rather get a fresh sandwich at Ralph< /review>

<text>This place ALWAYS has poorly trained employees. There must be something going on with management because every time we come here the employees seem to be in training.  They don't know how to operate the registers; food takes much longer than normal; and often the food seems to be prepared differently than other McDonalds.
I inky cone here when I need food and forgot to stop at the other McDonalds on the way to the freeway.< /text><rate>2</rate><GmapID>0x80c29e6437da2abb:0xc1973f0299c47422</GmapID><response>None<//response>< name>

<review>Yes. It's McDonald's and expectations should be low. This location doesn't meet the minimum one could reasonably have. The tables are dirty, the service is rude, and something is always broken. Some days they can't take credit cards, sometimes it's the ice maker and today . . . no ice cream based items. No shakes, cones etc. It's always something.</review><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c29e6437da2abb:0xc1973f0299c47422</GmapID><rate>2</rate>< date>

<text>I ordered a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle and they got my order wrong with sausage instead. I asked to have them fixed it so they used the same one and just switched it with a new slice of cheese. That in itself is a health code violation.< /text>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Lousy services we were looking at stops there not even a good morning or even give us up and we were going to attend this way it was today at 7:45 in the morning we had to leave without what we were going to order because nobody gave us services but neither manager who are the ones who have to be the example for the people who are under their charge

(Original)
Pésimo servicios nos miraban allí paradas ni un buenos dias ni si quiera nos desian ya las bamos atender así fue el día de hoy a las 7:45 dela mañana tuvimos que irnos sin lo q ivamos a ordenar por que nadie nos prestó servicios pero ni la manager q son los que tienen que ser el ejemplo para la jente q esta bajo su cargo<//Text>

The positives:
They're responsive and kind when you speak on the phone and offer help or will send someone out right away.

If an appliance stops working they work to get you a new one fairly easily. Had a fridge go out and they replaced it with one that was too big but helped get the right one in there.

They got a new laundry machine when the one that barely worked broke down.

Keith and Perla are very kind people, always easy to work with and helpful, but see below for the negatives on the move out as that was where I feel they felt short.

The negatives:
They hire the cheapest contractors they can find and the contractors they hire won't do the work right or well. (Had a carport leak that dropped residue constantly on my new car when it rained, they didn't fix it right as the grating didn't fit in the drain, and it still leaked)

Laundry machines on site were terrible, and I mean terrible. I've lived in a lot of apartments and I've never experienced such poor laundry machines. It costs you about 5-6 dollars in quarters just to do the laundry and end up with it damp.

The cleanliness when I moved in was disgusting, but I needed a place and didn't complain about it at the time. (Pee below the toilet, a dirty shower, oven still had stuff in it etc)

The moving out process was the most uptight I've ever seen especially given the above statement on the cleanliness upon moving in. I went around the house with my girlfriend for hours filling every tack hole (yes tiny little tack holes that you couldn't even make out half the time) because of the complaint that holes hadn't been filled. Getting my deposit back I was deducted based upon that.

I also was deducted based upon touch up paint and minor scuffs which in any other apartment falls under the normal wear and tear so this came as a surprise to me because I've never been charged for something of that sort. Also the way they like to paint things is by just painting over old peeled paint and not sanding it and doing it correctly therefore making it easier for it to degrade.

The other surprise to me was that they called out that they had to replace items that weren't there when I moved in such as a tub stopper. (The tub has a valve switch to plug and unplug the drain which didnt work upon moving in but that's besides the point).

Apparently it took someone two hours to fill pinholes and paint minor wear which also is a surprise to me.

Overall I'd rate experience living in the apartment as fine and acceptable. The moving out part was the worst move out experience I've had.

Honestly look somewhere else if you'd like to have someone who will repair your issues correctly. And unless you like losing a chunk of your already ridiculous deposit to superficial things mentioned above then I recommend looking elsewhere.</text>

When dealing with these property managements out here in Sonoma county, idk about anywhere else but you have to do the work, you have to call and check your application status. Make sure they all you need because nobody will call you and ask though just probably move on to the next person.</text>

Susana is wonderful and was extra helpful throughout the process of finding a home. She made sure to communicate with us and was prompt in answering all our questions. She is kind, professional, understanding, and fair. I would happily work with her again. Thank you!</Text>

~Update: I was compensated by Keith Becker for the cleaning I did. My rating I'd now 5 stars. I am 100% satisfied with my experience at DeDe's~

With Perla's help, we were able to apply for our house and get accepted within 1 week. The process was very easy. Also, DeDe's Rentals was consistently the only agency that always had some rentals which allowed pets We love our home.
Sadly, I just found out that the time I spent cleaning the filthy kitchen and laundry appliances will not be reimbursed. I asked to be reimbursed for $75 for 3 hours of cleaning with my supplies, or $88 for a pro-rated rent amount.  The rental manager declined my request and said it was as-is. I didn't know that could apply to cleanliness.</text>

<user_id>102320521181930207739< /user_id><Name>Tony Massara< /Name><Review>As a long term renter, my review is simple.  Houses need repairs, and the responsiveness of Dede’s staff in coordinating those repairs has been flawless.  If they say they’ll call back, they will.  Somebody out sick that day?  Someone else steps in, seamlessly, and the team makes it happen. You can tell a happy crew, and the results speak for themselves.

Ariel, Perla, and Ana deserve special recognition: they’ve earned it. If you’re still reading reviews, it’s because you’re still looking.  Why not choose to deal with someone who enjoys what they do, people with a sense of humor and charm. Professionalism is a bare minimum in business, wit and personality is what really stands out in the long term-and why I’m still a long term renter.<//Review>< resp>

We had only 2 weeks to find a something since our previous landlords sold the house we were staying in. She is wonderful, not only professional but very understanding and goes beyond to help. Even during this crazy pandemic she is always willing to help and talk. I highly recommend Ana to anyone if they are looking to find something. She showed us many places to make sure we found what was right for my family.</Review><user_id>109244093036266613124<//user_id></record>

<review>I applied for a rental with DeDe's Rental recently and was impressed with my experience. During the stress of Covid the office staff were friendly, informative, practiced safe precautions when I had to enter the office, and answered all of my questions promptly via email. Their website for submitting maintenance requests and rent is easy to use. I would recommend working with them.</review>< Rating>

<text>I have really enjoyed working with Dedes. The overall leasing experience was fast and easy.  Ana is a very nice property manager to work with and we heard back from her with an approval within the week that we applied. One thing that I noticed when I moved in today was how clean the property was. Even the window tracks were spotless and you can definitely tell it was professionally cleaned before our move in. I also would like to give a big thank you to Jenny who did measurements for us before we moved in to make sure our refrigerator would fit.  Everyone here is very friendly and responsive.

We recently hired Dede's rental to manage our property. Ariel is our property manager.

This is difficult time for both renters and property owners because of Covid. But, we were able to rent out our house in two weeks. Ariel genuinely cares for both owners and the tenants. She is such a decent human being.  We feel lucky to work with her. Thank you! Ariel.<//review>

I worked closely with Susana and Cristal at DeDe's Rentals as a renter. They were amazing to work with. Susana was very responsive and really cared about our family finding a home and navigating the application process. We recently lost our home to the Glass Fire and having Cristal, Susana and the rest of DeDe's Rentals help us quickly find, and move into, our rental home was a blessing. We are so grateful for the help and highly recommend DeDe's (as a renter or home owner). Thank you!</review>

<text>As property managers, they are in a position to balance the needs of owners and occupants. I think DeDe's does an excellent job of balancing between the two parties. They look out for their tenants. They also are very transparent with the owners and clearly articulate how the property is being managed.< /text>< Pictures>

As a property owner I have to say working with Ariel and Perla at DeDe's Rentals was an absolute joy. The guidance and effectiveness of the team is really top notch, they are absolute professionals. I will work with them again in the future and would highly recommend them to others.<//review>

< Review>
I am writing a review for the excellent service provided by Cristel and Patricia.  Helping me achieve our goal to pay our rent in a timely manner seems simple.  My parents, however, are 90 yrs. old, not computer savvy and unable to drive.  Cristal walked me through a process that made it all easier for us.  My tanks and appreciation!</Review>

<review>I wanted to leave a review for Perla Perez. We recently had a leak from our toilet and had to have a plumber come out 3 separate times to figure it out. Perla was persistent and consistent with staying in contact with me and sending them right back as soon as possible and had me check in with her to make sure the plumbers were actually reaching out to me. Her hospitality and customer service surpassed my expectations. I really hope for Perla to advance in this company because she is a natural.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8084387271ffec67:0xe4cd40b97dcd05cf< /gmap_id></record>

<review>I have nothing but good things to say about Dede's Rentals. I had been looking for a rental for months and when I finally decided on the house I wanted it was being managed by Dede's Rentals. The entire process was not as complicated as I thought it would be thanks to Susana Hernandez. She was friendly and professional. She answered all my questions thoroughly, she would respond to all my messages quickly and helped our family get into the right home. I would definitely recommend Susana and Dede's Rentals to my family and friends.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I must say that they have been incredibly responsive during these difficult times in which we find ourselves.  Researching new law, propositions, etc. and giving information and suggestions.

<Text>DeDe’s Rentals & Property Management has managed our rental property for many years. We first hired DeDe’s for tenant placement – to screen applicants, show the property, and handle the required paperwork that goes along with lease of a rental property. Eventually we asked DeDe’s to take over full management of our rental and we could not be happier.

I cannot say enough good things about DeDe’s. We are very pleased with the management of our rental condo. Our property manager Ana and her assistant Ariel are awesome! They are both quick to reply to phone calls and/or e-mails. Ana and Ariel are true professionals. They know the property management business and are a pleasure to work with. Ana is always there to assist and take care of whatever needs to be done. She has met with maintenance technicians, dealt with our insurance claim adjuster on our behalf, assisted with paperwork, provided suggestions and assistance on unit upgrades. Thank you Ana!

I truly recommend DeDe’s Rentals & Property Management if you are looking for a company to manage your rental property or searching for a home to rent.<//Text><user>103335563609654649586</user><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

I showed up at their door a wreck with some money a steady job but with a extremely low credit score. They never once made me feel like I didn't have a chance or make me feel less than, what they did do was find me a place I could afford found ways to help me get in without breaking the bank. Fast forward to all the tragic things that have happened in the North Bay. All the fires flooding and electricity crisis. Every time tragedy struck, Keith and his staff would make contact making sure we were OK and offered up solution on how we all could pull together and get through these trying times. I never once felt in fear of loosing my place or there weren't willing to work with us if need be. I have lived all over the Midwest and east coast, renting every time, I have never found a property management company go that far out of their way to help their tenants feel supported and safe.

<Review>After a minor speed bump with my initial application(s), Susana Hernandez and Crystal Silva provided excellent customer service and communication. I had a problem with my application initially, but was in contact with them and was able to move in on the exact date requested. Keys, contract and utilities were smooth. The only reason why I couldn't give a 5th star is because I had difficulty with communication initially. The phone operators were a bit problematic in the status of property's. I would give a 4.5 if I could. Thank you for all your help Susana and Crystal for making the process smooth after the hiccup!

Actually also bumped it up to 5 stars because they have really impressed me with the service at the property. Anything I've needed was an easy email away and I have got the answer I needed. They have good answers and service people to help do work. Really enjoy that aspect of the agency.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1601094896075, 'text': 'Ryan, your comments about the phone system have been taken to heart, and we’ve made some significant changes to our answering and switchboard service.

Looking at the responses from DeDe's Rentals in regards to the customer complaints just seems very unprofessional. Instead of assisting the customers they are bickering with them through the review thread. Not proffesional at all. Nice rentals all though they require 3x the rent which is ridiculous. No wonder so many people are homeless. You would think a local business like themselves would help the community after such disasters such as Tubbs fire and the pandemic. Greedy rental market with no helping hand for the community.< /Review>

DeDe and Keith Becker has managed our properties in Santa Rosa for over 30 years.  We are out of state owners and have been completely satisfied with DeDe.  Keith has continued to educate himself on tenants / landlords issues and laws unique to CA.  He advocates for both tenants and landlords as well as active in the local community to address homelessness and housing issues.  We greatly appreciate his timely up-to-date communications during disasters and new legislative initiatives.  Thank you  very much for taking care of our residents and properties during this difficult pandemic time and through the many good and bad years.</text>

<Text>Ana @ Dede’s Rentals was warm and inviting. She made my first rental experience a memorable one. She gave me her business card and that of her assistant if contacting her ever were to be needed in the future. She is very professional and a perfect fit for the DeDe’s team. I am genuinely happy 😃 with my first apartment. I got an 1100 sq footer for a very good deal. Very spacious, new carpet, new faucets and beautiful oak tree view from my bedroom window. I can hear the wind rustling in the trees and crickets at night. Very relaxing and very peaceful. Ana, I would like to say thank you for being real, real professional, and really caring about making my rental experience easy and affordable. Best to you and your team.
I highly recommend seeing Ana, If you want  it done right!!!

Happy house hunting! :)</Text>< userid>

<text>Initially my relationship with Dede’s was merely to secure my lease with my landlord. My landlord became ill about 1.5 years into my lease and Dede’s began managing the property. Jenny has been very helpful and has a wealth of knowledge that has been very useful. If you’re lucky enough you will have Jenny for a manager. The rest of the staff is efficient as well but my experience with Jenny has really set the bar when it comes to management.</text>< gmapID>

<text>From the beginning, Dede’s rentals has made my experience looking for a home to rent very easy and streamlined. Anna, the property manager of the home I decided to rent, made the process very straightforward and any questions or concerns that I had, she addressed and answered in a timely manner. It can be very stressful and confusing trying to rent a home in a demanding market but Anna made it very easy for me and helped me look for the right one. She went over all of the paperwork with me, communicated with the owner about the additions that I wanted to make to the home to make the home more suitable for my living needs and gained approval every time. An example of that is adding an AC unit to the home.

All in all, the staff at Dede’s has been very helpful, courteous and attentive to my needs throughout the whole process.
In the past, I have had to deal with overbearing landlords wanting to continuously enter the home to make personal modifications which was exhausting for me and a constant reminder That I was at the mercy of the owners decision to do so and for as many times as they wanted. Through that experience, I learned that a 24hr notice is all that is needed in the state of California. Dede’s rentals and staff has ensured that I don’t have to deal with situations like that anymore and I can now live peacefully and comfortably. It’s safe to say that I am a very happy tenant :).<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1564794831034, 'text': "Hi Naomi - we recognize that, if not approached professionally and diplomatically, the landlord/tenant relationship can easily become very contentious.

<review>I’ve been looking for a place that I can afford off of a low salary in Santa Rosa. I looked all over Craigslist for 6 months and wasn’t able to find anything. I started to feel hopeless about it. Luckily, I was able to meet Ana at Dede’s. She listened to me, was understanding, empathetic, quick to reply, and was able to find me multiple places to look at within the first couple of days of meeting her. The application process was also fast and I got a response about getting accepted in less than a week. I had a great experience with this company. The staff was very friendly and professional!

We really enjoy having DeDe's Rentals as our property management. We are new tenants of a home in Santa Rosa and thus far our experience has been very positive. They have a very simple/easy process for viewing the home, applying for the lease, and finalizing our contract. They are centrally located in Santa Rosa, and their online portal is very easy/efficient way of paying rent and/or submitting maintenance requests. Would highly recommend them to friends/family in the area looking for house rentals.< /text>

<Text>Dede's Rentals makes the process of renting as easy as 1,2,3. Ana and Ariel were both very professional and easy to work with. With rental prices through the roof, its was nice to find a company that doesn't gouge their tenants on rent.

<review>Ana Pérez is an amazing property manager, she reliable, honest and hard working. In my experience every time something went wrong with our place she is always on top of it. My husband and I have  been with Dede’s over 3 years, if your considering renting you can rest assure that Dede’s is a trust worthy company and if your so lucky, Ana Is your girl.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x8084387271ffec67:0xe4cd40b97dcd05cf< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I just rented an apartment from DeDe's.  Perla at the front desk is great at explaining the nuances of each apartment requirement.  I was shown my apartment by Jenny who was noticeably kind and patient with my questions and went out of her way to go through each detail of the apartment.  Great service in this difficult market!< /Text>

Finding a place these days in the Santa Rosa area is harder than finding Hillary's missing emails or a day that Donald isn't tweeting about how bad certain news channels are that "he never watches".  But Dede's has come through for us in this time of need and specifically Ana.  With the rising cost of living, she was able to listen to our needs and find us the place that fit both our budget and lifestyle. We couldn't have done it without her.  Thanks Ana! -Anyong<//text>

I have had a working relationship with Dede's since 1997 as both a renter and property owner. The owner, Keith Becker, is ethical, extremely knowledgeable and makes every effort to do his very best for the property owner and tenant. The staff is professional and pleasant. Property manager Anna and her assistant Ariel go above and beyond! Thank you for all of your hard work!<//review>

The owner Keith needs a lesson on ethics. He denied my application after his employee gave us wrong information. What a waste of 10 hours of our life! I make a great living and so does my GF. We have excellent credit and excellent references as well as a high income. Upon taking the hour long trip to their office from our current residence they would not accept our application. They said bank statements will not suffice, they need tax documents. Are bank statements not verifiable income?!! I then requested to talk to the owner of the property personally since I was still in the process of doing my taxes and didn’t have the documents to produce. He wouldn’t let us even leave the application there nor talk to the owner.
The main purpose in hiring a property management company is to find the right fit for both the tenant and the owner. This is not Keith’s(owner of Dede’s) ultimate goal. He just wants to take the easy road and say”that’s not our policy”. He’s very rude over the phone and shouldn’t be in this profession. Don’t waste your time with this company!!</Text>

{'time': 1533166949199, 'text': 'I am wary of responding to each and every review, because I recognize that each has value and validity. However, I am frustrated by the allegations of this particular review. "John" was previously "Nick", but that\'s not of great consequence. What is of consequence: I informed Nick that, in relation to income, we request proof of legal, verifiable income. If a paid employee, paystubs work. If self-employed, tax returns are appropriate. Nick indicated that he\'s been self-employed for eight years, so we agreed his three most recent tax returns would be sufficient. However, according to Nick, these prior returns wouldn\'t accurately show his real income. He proposed that he be permitted to write a letter to the property owner, explaining why his circumstances are unique and why his application should be treated outside of standard process. I explained that, if we do so in this instance, we\'d need to be prepared to do so for any other applicant in similar circumstances. Furthermore, I didn\'t want to take any application fees without a reasonable expectation of being able to help. I - and everyone at DeDe\'s - try to maintain a high level of ethics. We are not perfect, and there\'s always room for improvement, but I don\'t believe there was any basis to say my ethics were in question. - Keith'}<//resp>

Dede's has been a positive and pleasant experience for renting in the Sonoma County area. Our property manager Ana and Ariel have been kind, honest, respectful and reliable to us since the beginning and we speak very highly of them both. When I enter the office even the front desk makes me feel greeted and welcomed!</Review>

<Text>Last fall DeDe's was recommended to me by the real estate agent who was helping me buy rental properties. I made an appointment with Keith Becker (owner/president) and we discussed what I was looking for in rents and tenants (families), he showed me the contract he has with the landlords and asked about the insurance I have for the properties. He told me that the company would conduct an inspection before the property was rented (and once a year after that) in order to determine what kinds of repairs would be necessary for "habitability".  He assigned my properties to agent Jenny Rihl.
Jenny did a walk thru with me for each of the properties.  She informed me of some repairs that were safety issues that I hadn't considered. Jenny arranged for the work to be done, either with in-house workers or outside vendors. She also set up ongoing yard maintenance. She cleared every repair with me. She put the properties on the rental market as they were repaired, and when she had applications from tenants, she presented them to me. If there was more than one application the choice of tenants was mine.  She took care of the lease agreements.

Since the properties have been rented, there have been a couple of repair issues that have come up and Jenny has taken care of them.

I want to be informed about anything that has to do with my properties and Jenny has kept me informed.  DeDe's sends out statements every month so that I have documentation of any cost, repairs, fees, etc. This is the first time I have dealt with a property management company and they have been very businesslike and I appreciate that. Jenny has been more than willing to answer any questions I have and to go out to the properties to check on repairs.  I'm happy to recommend DeDe's and Jenny and Keith to anyone needing property management help.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x8084387271ffec67:0xe4cd40b97dcd05cf< /Gmap_id><time>1554848231288</time></record>

I do not understand why Section 8 is not accepted in any of DeDe's Rentals.  I have  been on the program for years and have owners call me to return to their unit after I have moved on.  I am a great tenant with stellar rental history.  I am quiet and clean and respectful of others and property.  This is my home once I rent, and I treat it as such.  The HUD program is simple and wonderful for owners and renters alike.  DeDe's, please reconsider Section 8 as a good thing.< /review>

Keith and Jenny were very professional and knowledgeable when we did a walkthrough of a home I was considering renting. Dede's was extremely thorough both in explaining their rental policies to me and demonstrating all the structures they have in place to protect both tenant and landlord. Keith and Jenny prepared an exhaustive overview of comparables in the area and broke down how they decide what the market value is for a home and were very familiar with all the local laws and regulations that relate to rental properties and tenants' rights.
Very impressed by the professionalism at DeDe's. Would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to rent a property out.<//text>

My experience with Dede's has been most positive. I live in an older property and one of the many things Dede's has done outside of daily maintenance (which they do very well), is taking care of upgrades and structural issues. These events are difficult for tenants living on the property at the time. In my experience, when these projects need addressing the property management company usually evicts the tenant until the work is compete. Dede's has been most accommodating. They have shown a genuine concern for my inconvenience and well being. At the same time rendering the property to a safer and more comfortable level. I have appreciated their professionalism and courtesy.  I think if you are a responsible individual that respects the property on which you reside, you won't find a better property management company than Dede's. David Montgomery</review>

DD's management inspired us to buy our own house. And by inspire I mean that we couldn't even stomach the thought of renting again after all of our negative experiences. From the unprofessional owner Keith to service needs being ignored, the five years that we rented were not pleasant. Service people who didn't know what they were doing would come out (eventually) and fix the same problems over and over again until we gave up on calling. One thing in particular stands out in my mind: we were deciding if we wanted to renew our lease at a much higher rent. We had several days to decide. WE WERE THREATENED WITH EVICTION if we didn't sign. We are tier 1 credit, never missed a payment, but it was never about us because we aren't clients, we are merely renters. Also we would ask Dedes to communicate with the owners. The owners later told us this NEVER happened.< /text>

I thought DeDe's Rental was cool. They loan you the key to a rental you can check out for yourself.<//text>

This is a company that takes pride in what they do. All there team are accountable, they care, they have follow thru. I have enjoyed working with them. There actions show they know what they are doing. Cristal and was my property manager and was amazing to work with, She communicates great, follow thru asap. Debora, also in the management team always went out of her way to help with anything. I would highly recommend DeDe's Rentals to anyone. I look forward and expect to to do more business with them soon. This team is 2nd to none. Thanks again,</Text>

<Review>Man, they have zero tolerance for there applications. If you go here better have your tax income,references,5 year home proof, and most of all do not be honest with them. Not recommended for small business owners or anyone under the age of 20 that is just starting out.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x8084387271ffec67:0xe4cd40b97dcd05cf</Gmap_id><Rate>1</Rate><user>104538245858181337436<//user></record></dataset><record>

<username>Ruth Lapin</username><Text>After reading JB Albers review, I had to write and say how wonderful this management company has been. It was Keith's responsibility to secure the apartment for the owners who have trusted him with their property. They have managed our property for several years and living on the other side of the country which makes things way more complicated, they have been honest, always available and professional. I do not think you should take out your sadness on a company that was simply being responsible and doing the job they were hired to do.</Text>< rate>

Since 2017, DeDe's managed my property, professionally and upmost care. Thanks to Ariel Hiatt and her assistant Perla Perez, these ladies were always on top of their duties, not only they communicated promptly, they answered any questions or concerns of mine thoroughly. During the sale of my property, Ariel and Perla assisted my realtor with anything needed to make a timely escrow closure.
One of their great services of DeDe's is that they kept property owners informed with legal changes due to Covid, and continuously  provided communication during the fires of Sonoma County. I strongly recommend DeDe's property management services to anyone interested with renting their property. In Sonoma county, you will find no better.< /review>

Home owners at risk!/Poor business practices/ poor management .....Moved from AZ and was to be added on my fiancée lease for rental home she lived in for two years filled out all paperwork paid fee. I have a 767 fica score they did a hard hit on my credit record but never intended to provide us with lease. Fiancée been at the rental home for two years no late payments or infractions and on month to Month, but Dede can get $800 more in rent due to nor-cal fires and rental home shortage, so gave order to vacate with no just cause or opportunity to sign new lease. ...get the old out and jack the rate up is there motto!!!
.GO FIGURE!!!
. I will be serving them papers to correct the hard hit on my credit profile it's actually against the fair credit reporting act to do a credit check without do diligence . Having nothing negative and a high credit score they had no reason to deny me as an additional renter based on credit or income history and also a current AZ rental property owner.  Based on reviews on here from the home owners using this company they have no clue how this company is putting them in legal jeopardy with their wrongful practices. STAY TUNED!< /Text>

<review>My wife and I rented our upscale house in Santa Rosa after buying another home in Novato and moving there.  DeDe’s rentals has, so far, done an excellent job for us, taking care of numerous details flawlessly.
Our tenants, so far, are responsible people and we feel quite comfortable with them and with DeDe’s.  Cici Rosas, with many years experience at DeDe’s, is easy to work with and thoroughly professional.
We have recommended DeDe’s to other people who have rental property or who plan to.  We feel very comfortable having made these recommendations.<//review>< Pictures>

This is a joke as a company went to a open house viewing and door was looked all they said was opened at 4 got there at 425 and no one was there and no parking over populated for parking plus on top of that the rode it was on no one could show up right at 4 and did not tell us that the viewing stop at 430. If I could rate less the 1star I would< /text>

{'time': 1565453910660, 'text': "Occasionally, we APPRECIATE one-star reviews. This may very well be one of those instances.\n\nImagine this: a tenant has moved into a property that is governed by an HOA. The tenant, without the HOA's permission, gets a dumpster and plants it in one of the guest parking spaces, causing the HOA to send threatening notices to the landlord.\n\nFurther imaginings: The tenant is SUPPOSED to have only four residents in possession, but at the time of a scheduled periodic property review, the landlord counts EIGHT living there.\n\nDuring the same property review, the landlord discovers that there are issues that the tenant should certainly have reported, so those issues could have been repaired and maintained, but were never reported.\n\nAnd then imagine that the tenant decides that they no longer want to live in this particular property, but expect that they'll be able to rent a different property through DeDe's Rentals - and are upset when the landlord offers a sincere, professional, but straightforward explanation why there's no possibility of that happening.\n\nWhen it comes to one-star reviews, I'm willing to own this one."}< /resp>

<Review>Absolutely delicious water. I don't usually fill up a jug, but a nice lady insisted I do. She was like the "keeper of the fountain" for the day. The water is at a very low level so it is taking longer to fill. The right side pipe is completely dry. The middle pipe is flowing like a bathroom sink and the left side is almost a trickle. People don't care and fill up 5 gallon jugs and make people wait for 40 plus minutes.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This place was so amazing.  Stopped for awhile to walk around . Mountains were fixed to have a watering spot. People leave things as a token it was a relaxing place to clear your head . Need to stop and take in the views .</Review>

<Text>People come fill jugs and jugs of this water. Little kept secret. Water is clean and as fresh as you can get. I believe the fire department comes and checks the quality ever so often to ensure its drinkable.< /Text></record>

A little roadside attraction to see if hiking in the area. Nothing special only worth a visit if stopping here to hike or go to the beach.<//review>

<Time>1621561801871< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I went dress shopping at 4 other places, and even bought another dress at a different store, before buying my actual wedding dress here. I had such a great experience dress shopping here. The Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria has a seemingly endless amount of styles to try. My consultant was Kayla, and she was absolutely fantastic. She communicated with me prior to the appointment for my vision so she could pull styles ahead of my appointment. Additionally, during the appointment, Kayla was extremely attentive and really listened to what I did and didn't like about each dress. With every dress I tried, she paid attention to my feedback and presented me with better options with each next dress. She was also very cognizant of my budget, which is an understated quality - other places I went to kept trying to push dresses on me that were out of my price range or not in the style I wanted. She is by far the best dress shopping consultant I've had during this experience. The store also has a fabulous dressing room area and viewing/seating area for guests. I couldn't recommend the Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria enough to future brides out there!</review>< pics>

<Review>The staff here are incredibly kind and helpful. The alterations department did an outstanding job making my vision for my dress come true. The fittings were easy and quick, and the store is very transparent with pricing and services. My original consultant was Gloria and she was great. I am so happy that I found my perfect dress at Bridal & Tuxedo Galleria!< /Review><date>1623672640152</date>< user_id>

<Review>You know the feeling you want when you “say yes to the dress,” you’re not going to get it here. They will say anything to get you to buy the dress and, in the end, will not provide the quality services they promise.

Because I had a baby between the time I purchased the dress and the time I had it altered, the dress fit slightly differently than when I originally bought it. It still fit me, just had a few imperfections that needed to be altered but instead of offering solutions,, the consultants chose to make comments about my body - “that’s not the dress, that’s you,” “that’s because of your swelling,” “nothing we can do about that.”

They made the entire dress buying situation awkward and uncomfortable. I hated going back to my appointments but by the time I figured that out, I had already paid for the alterations and they won’t give refunds. Even when I brought all of this to their attention, they said they would do their best to remedy the situation but it was truly all talk. They’ll keep your money and pretend they tried to help but I promise you, they won’t.<//Review><gmapID>0x80d955b7f66baae9:0xb3f957c952f2eb4b<//gmapID>< response>
{'time': 1625263280506, 'text': 'Hi Daetona Lawrence, now Daetona Mascorro. We wish we could "rate" our customers too, but Google won\'t allow us to do that. We as a team tried everything possible to make you happy. Every request you had we did our absolute best. You insulted our staff calling them "stupid". You and your mother would say snotty remarks that were extremally rude to the seamstress and consultant helping you knowing that we can hear you, but we had to ignore your hostile tone. You would curse throughout our boutique at each appointment to the point our consultant was afraid to help you because she didn\'t want to get cursed at for only doing her job. You were extremely demanding and so rude. This store has been here for over 20 years and we have never had a bride as rude and disrespectful as you and your family. Your husband, Austin Mascorro already left us a poor review then you called and apologized and then deleted it only because we were still in the process of your alterations. We know in our hearts as the BTG team we accommodated you and your "requests/demands" more then any other bridal store ever would. The way you treated our staff, any other location would 100% say "here is your gown, you can go somewhere else" Your attempt to slander us on each social media platform just shows how rude and disrespectful of a person you are. You bought your gown March 2020 and did not start alterations till June 2021 and we expressed our alterations prices increased since your 2020 appointment (as everywhere else prices are increasing). We still honored our old prices to help you as much as possible because we knew you had just had a baby.\nYour alterations were done impeccable and your family and friends will agree with that when they see you in your dress on you wedding date.\nBest of luck.'}<//response>

<gmapID>0x80d955b7f66baae9:0xb3f957c952f2eb4b< /gmapID><text>My experience here was uncompassionate, and I was made to feel extremely uncomfortable. My mother had flown in specifically to help me shop for my dress. Prior to her arrival, I had injured my ankle and was wearing a large brace and crutches. I was already feeling sad about this happening since my mom and I were looking forward to wedding dress shopping for so long! This was not what we planned, but we were making the most of it and keeping a positive attitude. Gloria assisted us. One of the first things she said to me was "I'm really not sure how you're going to try on fitted dresses with THAT going on" as she waved her hand at my leg. Would you say that to someone in a wheelchair or otherwise?? Completely rude. I told her that I knew how to handle it and that she needn't worry about it. She showed us some dresses she pulled based on a very quick phone call she made to me less than 24 hours before my appt. We went back to the dressing room where she told my mother "normally no one else is allowed back here to help her with the dresses but I guess I can allow it". Excuse me?? This is my mother helping me! I told my mom it was ok, I could handle it, so my mom went to look around the shop. Gloria found my mom and instructed her not to touch the dresses. She explained that m mother may point to dresses but only Gloria may handle them. Lastly, all the dresses she pulled were not what I had described. When I tried to explain this she said “Well, did you look online like I had suggested when we talked yesterday?’ Ummm no Gloria, I did not drop everything I was doing at 3pm, the day before my appointment to look online at dresses from your shop. Her tone was defensive and slightly condescending as if I was the problem because I did not look online with less than 24 hours warning and with my parents arriving from out of town. I explained I did not have time on such short notice and that other life things took precedence yesterday. I thought our phone conversation yesterday covered all those bases. I was halfway through trying on a second dress when she was in the dressing room watching me and saying “I am worried about your safety, and I’m ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE DRESSES… but of course your safely with you trying these on.” (as she stared at my brace and boot).  It was very apparent that she was clearly worried about the  dresses more than me… we left after 10 minutes of her uncompassionate demeanor. If I would have started with this shop, my heart and excitement would have been ruined for the day. Thankfully, the next couple shops were kind and accommodating and did not make me feel that the dresses or more able-bodied people were more important than my wedding dress shopping experience.</text>< user_id>

I always strive for treating brides/customers with dignity, equality and\nrespect. Reviews from brides/customers to me and left here in Yelp, Google and Facebook\nattest to themselves.\nAt B&TG, we follow some rules and policy procedures in cases like yours when you\ncome to try on a wedding gown. Your safety and wellbeing were my/our priority at your visit.\nYou were very defensive when I said I was sorry about what had happened to you...your answer\nwas, “let's just leave it as it is”. That confirmed to me that you were not having a good day.\nRight away, I pulled the gowns I considered you would like to try on based on our phone\nconversation the day before. It is customary in the bridal industry to interview a bride prior their\nvisit to a boutique so that way, bridal consultants can use appointment time efficiently and have\nmore dresses in their brides try on lists. It was never an issue not having the time to search our\nwebsite or bring your own list of gowns. I also allowed your mom in the fitting room to help you\nwhen this is not a regular practice. I honestly did it in consideration of your physical condition.\nAt B&TG, we never ever deprive our brides or their guests of touching the gowns. Besides, who will\ngo to a bridal boutique if brides/guests cannot look, touch, try on or ask questions about dresses?\nAt our boutique, we treat every single gown with love and care and with the next bride in mind,\nbeing so conscious about the amount of money involved in the purchasing and the sacrifice that it takes to acquire a wedding gown… that is why, we are so careful and sensitive about how we handle our gowns.\nI tried my best to be helpful, caring, respectful, emphatic and communicative. I tried to understand your situation about your budget and your imminent wedding date and the fact that you did not disclosed your physical condition before attending your appointment.  In my opinion, a good attitude from the beginning of your appointment would have been a plus!. I Love my job and working for B&TG where our goal is to be exceptionally good at customer service and to make every single bride look amazingly beautiful and happy on their big day and we really have accomplished it! Good luck in your search. Gloria"}</response><user_name>Heather R< /user_name><time>1624908174078</time><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<Text>This place is incredible!! They have such an amazing selection of very reasonably priced and absolutely beautiful wedding dresses (and bridesmaids dresses, tuxes, veils, and accessories)! I loved that I was able to view most of the dresses online beforehand, especially during Covid. Davina was incredible and able to answer any question I threw at her. All the staff I encountered were so friendly and knowledgeable! The fact that they also do in-house alterations makes the process that much easier and so convenient. I would highly recommend checking this place out!! Loved my experience and I'm absolutely in love with my dress!<//Text>< pics>

Experience at first was good, but when my daughter decided to pick up her dress, the tear they had promised to fix was done very shoddy and they refused to fix it correctly. It seemed they literally used a hot glue gun to fix the hole on the dress. Unfortunately my daughter had signed off on the terrible repair because her wedding was only a couple of weeks away, and was anxious enough, but when my wife went back to ask for the repair to be done correctly they told her it was signed off on and that was it. My wife was adamant about getting it fixed correctly, but it seems the “owner” of the establishment was even more adamant of not doing the repair and got in her face and screamed at her. Luckily I was not there, because I would have not been as restrained and left as my wife did. Getting up in a woman’s face and doing this, crazy, I was convinced not to go back and have a word with this “gentleman” so that I would not end up behind bars before my daughters wedding, Christmas, New Years, etc.
Needless to say, before you sign off on any purchase here, please ensure the work is completed properly, or shop elsewhere as I’m sure there are many other reputable and civilized bridal places in San Diego.<//Text>

<Text>I can't say enough good things about this place. It's amazing.

Customer Service is excellent and they give their professional advice about what to pick out for every single event.

I've rented here several times for weddings and black tie events.

The store is open 7 days a week so in case of an emergency you can always call them or walk in. They also have same day service for certain styles.

Highly recommend this place based on his service and variety of styles and colors.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>This is a lovely shop with so many beautiful options for wedding dresses at very reasonable prices. Their system for choosing dresses to try on is so easy, and makes the process so much more efficient and organized than other shops. The staff are all terrific, and Janet, the manager is extraordinarily helpful, sweet, and patient. It's a very small space (though they still have TONS of dresses) -  I recommend making an appointment during a less popular time so you have more space to see yourself in the mirror and have your guests sit comfortably.  I highly recommend this shop!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

They have this computer system where I can see pictures of dresses in human models and then choose ones to try. Also they gave me hard copies of the dresses that I chose as for my top 2. So easy and convenient!! The conditions of their samples are excellent and prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80d955b7f66baae9:0xb3f957c952f2eb4b</gmapID><Text>I just went to this place this weekend.
Most important info: If you are a size 12 or above don't waste your time coming here!!!! They won't have a dress for you to try on.

First, the second you walk into the store you feel cramped and crowded. The dresses seemed really worn and the store felt a little low-end.

Second, the lady I spoke with asked me to pick out gowns that I liked from an IPad. She barely spoke to me to get my input of what I like or don't or what I was looking for.

Third, you will have to share the stage with other girls modeling for their guest. Everyone is around the stage watching and talking among themselves and sometimes loudly. They didn't even have enough chairs for two out of four of the people that came with me. They had to stand.

Fourth, the lady helping was nice herself, however she only could get me size 10s and was trying to force them onto me saying she could try to pin it or I should hold up the top to get the style. I told her I couldn't even get a good idea since I was just holding it up. When they didn't fit, I feel like she started to panic and was just finding ANY dress that could fit. I was able to try ONE size 12 dress that fit, however that was it. She was just trying to sell me a dress, not trying to find my dress.

It doesn't make any sense to me to only have size 10s and below for dresses. Which is fine, however then you should indicate that on your website that you only have samples that are 8-10.

If you are a 25 year old, at most a size 8, and on a tight budget, you will probably have good luck finding a dress. But try going to a real boutique and you will have a completely different experience. Luckily earlier that day I went to another boutique and had an incredibly awesome experience so this one didn't ruin my day. I had a private room for myself and the girls, the sales lady sat down and looked at my pictures and then went to gather the dresses and helped me put them on. ALL of them fit with clamps on the back for excess materials.

Good luck and I hope you at least go to another boutique for a real experience!<//Text><username>Carol Deak< /username><Date>1467071575117</Date><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY MAKE YOU ORDER LARGER DRESSES JUST SO THAT YOU NEED TO PAY MORE FOR THEM TO FIX THEM ( SUPER EXPENSIVE). THEY TAKE YOUR MEASURES AND THEN DECIDE TO ORDER LARGER DRESSES BECAUSE ¨THEY RUN SMALL¨ (THEY DON´T). AND YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR PLUS SIZES ( I´M NOT EVEN A PLUS SIZE AND THEY MADE ME ORDER A PLUS SIZE).
THEY GAVE ME THE DRESS TOTALLY WRINKLED, IT HAD A FISHY SMELL AND THE STITCHES ARE A MESS. I´M PRETTY SURE THEY ORDER THEM FROM CHINA OR WISH! IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I TRIED ON ON MY FITTING. A TOTAL REGRET!!! AND THEY ACT ALL RUDE AND ACTUALLY KINDA RACIST!  DON´T GO THERE !!! IT´S EXPENSIVE AND A TOTAL RIP OFF< /Review>< date>

They have a great selection of dresses and I love that they use the iPads to show you the different styles, as I had no idea what I was looking for in the first place. Brianna attended me and she was great and able to find everything I was looking for quickly. After I found my dress, she was also extremely helpful with the veil. Not only did I have a perfect experience finding my dress, they were also extremely knowledgeable about tuxedos and have a wide selection of bridesmaids dresses. I will be purchasing the tuxedos for the groomsmen and dresses for my bridesmaids from here as well.

Enrique helped my dad, my best man, my fiancé's nephew and myself to pick out our their suits and my tuxedo. He was never pushy about anything, answered any sorts of questions that I had, and gave great advise about everything. Made the experience very easy and comfortable for us. I believe, price wise, this place is like most other places. I remember paying about the same for a suit years ago at another place.

Thanks Enrique!<//Review>

< Review>
They ordered the wrong size bridesmaid dresses for 4 out of 4 of my bridesmaids. They ordered the wrong size tuxes for 4 out of 4 of my groomsmen. When asked what happened, they stated they cant help it if our wedding party gains or losses weight. Our measurements were sent in 6 weeks prior to our wedding, and none of our wedding party had gained or lost weight in those 6 weeks. At least as much weight that would have accounted for the size differences and all 8 members of our party...give me a break! My bridesmaids were forced to pay as much in alteration costs as they paid for the dress. We were running around the day of the wedding trying to get the right sizes of tuxes for our groomsmen. It was a total disaster. I have filed multiple complaints with the manager, he just keeps saying that my wedding party had weight flucuations. Now to my dress. They ordered my dress in a size smaller than I usually wear. When I asked before the order was placed, they insisted that wedding dress sizes run differently than other sizes. I signed off on the order. When I picked up my dress, it was very noticeably too small. By this point we had several small disputes with them about other things related to our wedding, so I just opted to take my dress to a different seamstress. I ended up paying hundreds of dollars in alterations. When I confronted the manager with this, he stated that I had gained weight and then stated "it didn't matter because you signed off on the size." I only signed off on it because they said that the sizes are different on wedding dresses. From the 20+ vendors we used for our wedding they were the ONLY vendor we had issues with. Awful, please do not do business here!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Very rude! They do not ask your size or help you get into any dresses. They brought all but one of the dresses I wanted to try on in either two sizes too small or four sizes too big and without any help into the dresses. At other stores even if it's not quite your size you have someone who can help you fit into it and they make you feel beautiful. Here, when I asked for help because nothing was fitting they just said that they only had sample sizes so my choices were either a 10 or a 20. At another store they would have offered to help. But instead they just made it sound like my body type was the problem. Terrible, negative experience. If you are higher than a size 10 then please do not go here.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<pics>None</pics><Review>Honestly, the best tuxedo place in San Diego!! I went shopping around for the best price in town for a fancy Ralph Lauren Tux for my wedding, since in my wife's culture is custom that i pay for all groomsmen tuxes plus ring boy, (tell me about it lol) so 6 tuxes plus mine was a pretty penny, specially Ralph Lauren. Cheapest I found not including shoes was close to $250 each elsewhere and when I came to this place is was shocked how much cheaper it was and it included the shoes. I won't give out prices but drastic difference. The 5 groomsmen, ring boy and I went in and we got fitted and everything went smoothly, all tuxes were correct in size and ready with time to spare for the wedding. They had every type of color vest, that picking our wedding color  was easy. The return post wedding of the tuxes was easy as well. I went in looking for a tux and came out making a friend for a lifetime, the owner Enrique is a classy guy, helpful, knowledgeable and amazing. I found my tux place, I was thinking of buying a tux for future wedding's but with the prices and friendship I built with Enrique, I look forward to coming by many many times. Thank you Enrique from your new life long friends, Suzane & Jonathan.< /Review>< gmapID>

Emily was fantastic. She was always smiling and sharing stories with me and she let me browse through their whole collection. I easily found a replacement dress for the one I lost at Bride & Veil (see my awful review of them on their google site). Everything went great until alterations. The price of the dress was less then HALF the price of the one I lost (big thumbs up), BUT the alterations made up for it. $400! I understand that hemming a lace dress is a pain in the butt especially when it has beading, but $400?! I sucked it up and agreed to it because my wedding was just around the corner. I was told I would be able to pick my dress up in about 3 weeks with one fitting in between to make sure it was what I wanted. I went in for the fitting and it was still all pins! Nothing was sewn yet. I figured I don't know anything about alterations so maybe they worked faster then I thought and this would be ok. This was 1 week away from my pick up date. I went in on the date to pick up and it WASN'T DONE! It wasn't even STARTED! The alterations lady (who is super sweet, but this still upset me) said that their other alterations lady quit and she had to pick up the slack for her, and their was an emergency dress that had to be done that day and my dress would be ready the next day. I was super stressed out at this point. My fiance went to pick up the dress for me and did the inspection and said he was concerned but would bring it home for me to see. When I saw it I almost had a breakdown. The back panel (behind the corset ribbon) was FALLING OFF. There were little threads hanging out all over. The appliqué looked like they were put on a different kind of tulle then they were made on and the edges were frayed (not trimmed up). I really wanted to give a good review because everyone was so sweet there, but I was so upset with the results I just can't give all stars. I am not saying not to shop here, I think you'll have a good experience here, just be sure to be VERY CLEAR about ALL DETAILS of your alterations, and stay on top of it, don't just trust it will be done right.< /Review>

I had a similar experience as everyone else. I had even look this place up and read some reviews, I just thought only people who had a bad experience were posting and that no one was posting anything good. Please listen to the reviews. My first appointment was fine and the sales lady was very helpful. After that the seamstress was horrible. They took over 5 weeks to do 5 inches of beading and add a hook in the back. Each time I was to come in for a fitting they called me the day before to say they needed more time. They also asured me that my dress would be cleaned and all of the lose threads trimmed before I picked it up.  This was not case. I have spent hours fixing my dress. I ended up canceling the tux reservations to save our self the headache.  Take everyones advice and spend the extra money some place else!< /text>

I got the Denver omelet and it was so good. I would recommend to try this place if you're out of state and want something good, you won't find it at home. Small place but the servings are a good size.</review>

<text>Great portions and food quality for the price. Reminds me of the northeast, where you can hit a family style diner and not spend a lot. Came here when it was busy on a Saturday morning and service was pretty good despite the serving staff having to attend both indoor and outdoor guests.< /text>< GmapID>

The staff was very friendly, and the food was delicious! It was great sitting outside in the wonderful weather enjoying brunch and the sea breeze. Highly recommended if you want a nice setting but without all the tourists.</Review>

Got breakfast here and it was the worst I have ever had. We got the chicken fried steak and a cinnamon roll. It was cold, had almost zero gravy. The steak was a nasty mush like dog food. The potatoes were plain, out of the bag frozen squares with zero gravy to disguise it. The cinnamon bun was something cold out of a plastic bag, probably from 7-11. 0 stars. I could barely eat it and I will eat just about anything. Avoid breakfast here!! Don's or Mary's has excellent chicken fried steak if that is what you crave. It's real cooked food and delicious.<//text>

I had the corn beef hash and eggs with hash browns.  They served the hash crispy like I asked for it.  Yum.  My wife likes her bacon served in the crispy almost to the original carbon form.  Bingo.  They did it just right.<//review>< pictures>

2nd time visiting 101 Cafe back in 2016 was when we discovered it. I have been craving this place for months now. I very scared this place might of not make due to 😷🦠☣️

LUCK FOR US its open for business cute temporary outside patio next to the 101 route

I got Driving South a$12.00 dish
Chicken fried stake covered is county gravy 2 eggs your choice of style house potatoes

Highly recommend it

+++ Cool murals sounding the cafe</Review>

Iconic Diner in downtown Oceanside. Very cool retro vibe with stainless steel tables and lots of history but the food was quite sub-par. My pork chops were like shoe leather and so was my husband’s ham steak. The bread was old. Such a disappointment in terms of food... and the bathrooms are outside across the parking lot. They do give you the quarter to put in for the bathroom.

I wouldn’t have minded the bathrooms so much if the food had been higher quality.

Despite all this, they were very busy.< /review>

< review>
The quality of food and pricing was on point! Ya never want to go where you over paid and your still hungry. This place for the amount of money and portion size as well as quality of food makes it worth it. Friendly staff. Serves quick! What makes this food unique. After you eat you feel a good full. And no food coma as if it a heavy food!

Update: I always give credit when it's due. This place is one of my favorite local places of Oceanside CA. Fresh,  attentive, friendly. Parking lot is small. But when you come on the downtime. It's a nice lovely cosey place to have lunch and breakfast. You can ask the waiter or waitress what they recommend and they will give you there opinion because they tried it! Keep it up! Oh fyi just make sure you get the French fries underneath the table clean!< /review>

<Review>The burgers here are really freaking good. Historic places established back in 1929. Be sure and take a pic on the south side of the building as a souvenir. Staff was friendly and attentive. Prices were reasonable. Would definitely return next time I'm in the area.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

It was fun but slow. My husband liked the Denver omelet a lot. My biscuits under country gravy were doughy and the gravy was bland. Really nice about modifications.</text>

For a quick look back in time at life in Oceanside stop in and grab a bite while the friendly staff in the photo share a few peeks of Oceanside's history. Don't forget to try the malts with your home cooked meal, done like mom made back then.</Text>

It has always been a great experience with the staff, good food, and environment. I have had food ranging from the Classic French toast to the South of the Border machaca and have never been disappointed, delicious range of dishes. I would defiantly recommend this place to be a fast choice on a dinner date or to bringing the whole family.

<Review>Reminds me of the many Mom and Pop restaurants in Wisconsin. Definitely a cool place too check out. Food was pretty decent, closes at 3pm. But, still a pretty neat place to check out and eat at for a reasonably priced food.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

A tasty diner that feels like it did when it opened decades ago. You'll definitely feel like you have stepped back in time when you step through the doors here. Staff was friendly and attentive and quick. The food was good, but pretty standard for a diner. They won't surprise you with weird gourmet options, but you will find all the traditional favorites here.</Review>

<review>Updated Review: Extremely impressed with the owner's prompt response and willingness to fix an issue my husband and I had after making a trip to Oceanside from Orange County. For this reason, I am changing my previous review and giving them 5 stars! We would love to return again soon!

Great open air cafe. Fantastic food,  portions and service. Highly recommend for breakfast.

** Fair warning though,  no indoor restroom so if it's raining,  be prepared to walk across the parking lot. They will however give you a quarter for the paid restroom.</Review>

Great food, good prices, friendly staff. Definitely will be making a trip up to Oceanside again to try more things on the menu!

We were on our way to beach break cafe and the line was out the door. I had remembered seeing 101 Cafe in our way to it and suggested we go there. SO HAPPY we did! Everybody in our group decides the food was better and the vibe of the place was awesome.<//Review>

The decor is awesome, but when your view goes from the pictures to the ceiling fans, watch out!! It looks like YEARS of dust, grease and filth are caked on the blades. The potatoes had absolutely no seasoning, my wife's "salad" looked as if it were poured out of a half-priced iceberg lettuce mix bag with three sad cherry tomatoes on the side. You can get better tasting tuna out of a can or at Subway. The coffee cake was so vile, I took a few chews and had to spit it out.</Review>< pics>

Small, quaint breakfast and lunch shop right on coast Highway 101 in Oceanside California. This little place does not have any ocean views, being about 1/8 mile from the coast. However, food was reasonably priced and very good. Waitress was friendly, attractive, and efficient. The parking is free.<//Text>

Love this place for its location, its history, and the food....but last few times I've gone the service was, well it wasn't too friendly. Staff always leave you hanging unless your a regular or family, and its hard to ask for something because they never look around enough or ask. Especially when its full house, I get it, busy, but gotta make time for your guests. Still its a good place to grub and the location is great, hopefully it changes a bit.</Text>

This place is an authentic 60s-era diner. Very nostalgic. My Turkey sandwich was hand carved and the soup was excellent. I love the old photos of oceanside for decor.</review>

<review>So, I have not been here since 1995. Since I'm out here working I decide to stop by.  Love that it is still pretty much the same!! Got breakfast, green Chile omelette. Very good. I recommend it. The service was excellent. Back to the omelette, did I mention it was freaking tasty,lol. Stop by and check it out. I'll be back.</review>< pictures>

The food was great! Tge service was excellent. I had the Texas Chilly omelette and they made it just right. Tge place is where locals and tourists come to enjoy a piece of Oceanside history. It is always busy so that by itself says alot. The pancakes here are also delicious. Tge parking is little tight and limited but there is room for extra cars on the street. I would go back time after time.</Text>

<Date>1530646472021<//Date><Rate>3< /Rate><Review>We are on a vacation and decided to come here and grab a bite. We saw this cafe when we were driving around and wanted to come for breakfast. The service was not too great and we had to grab our own menus before the waitress had come outside to take our drink order. We waited over 25 minutes to get our drink order and sat there almost a hour before we got our food. The tea didn't taste fresh and the coffee was average. Our food was alright, but didn't settle well prior to eating. We sat outside so we didn't experience the retro vibe. Maybe they were having a bad day because all the reviews seem good.<//Review>< Pics>

What a great little find in oceanside. I went for a drive a couple of weeks ago to explore some new areas I had not been to. I stopped into the 101 cafe for some lunch and really enjoy the food and atmosphere of a true 50's type dinner. The waitress  was great and the food was some much better than I thought it might be....<//Text>

<Text>My boyfriend is stationed at Camp Pendleton, and everytime I come to visit we eat here just about every single morning for breakfast! And, we absolutely love it!!!!! The pile up is amazing and the coffee is probably the best I have ever had! They have the most friendly service, we love Maddie, and the food is amazing! We love 101 Cafe!!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

A definite slice of Americana.  Cute roadside diner with stainless steel tables--cool to lean on the tables indoors when it's hot outside!  The place is small and there may be a wait on weekends.  Nevertheless worth a stop when you're in that 50s diner kind of mood.  I liked the ham and egg scramble for breakfast.<//Review>

good vegetarian options, although the corned beef hash here reputedly is the best in town; shakes and floats come in one size: ridiculous</Text>

<review>Killer breakfast, we've been there twice. Quant little place, we shared an omelette, and instead of them cutting one in half, they gave us each our own little ones. It was a really thoughtful way to split an otherwise huge breakfast!</review>< pics>

These old historic diners are slowly disappearing but this one endures. Big meals so think of sharing if you don't have a big appetite. Gets busy here in the morning. Egg dishes are good but their biscuits and gravy is a winner.< /text>

<text>Used to be a great place, although it's touristy, that's not a bad thing! Excellent breakfast and lunch. Great service. Now? Worst burger I've ever eaten, asked for medium, came shriveled and burnt by the lousiest server, cant really call her that. There was an old woman cleaning tables, while the child served was trying to make shakes from ice milk with syrup added to make flavored. Can't afford ice cream? Or a real burger party, this anorexic burger couldn't be cooked medium because it's so small, if you flip it once, it's well done! Run elsewhere! Beachbreak on Cassidy right up the street!< /text><Time>1532035580357< /Time>< resp>
{'time': 1532565021048, 'text': 'Ronna, I’m sorry your experience wasn’t the best.  But I can reassure you that we use real ice cream and nothing else (thriftys to be extract). As far as syrups we like to add certain flavors to it nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWe are sorry that your burger didn’t come out  as you would have like it. We could have easily remade it for you if you would have let your server know.\n\nFor our burger we use 100% angus beef which we hand patty to 5oz, it cost us a little more then the regular we try to provide quality products to our guest.\n\nAs the old women you mentioned, well that one of the owners. She a hands owner that works side by side her employee to try and make the 101 cafe as best as possible for all our guest.\n\nOnce again we are sorry that your personal experience at the 101 fell short of your expectations. We will use this review to help our crew understand that one miss step service and in our food preparation can turn a promising experience into and not so one.\n\nThank you for your comments Ronna and have a wonderful day!'}<//resp>

We love this place. Right on highway 1 and blocks from the ocean it is always cool and sometimes crowded, but the service is consistently friendly. There are some different food choices on their menu and you can peruse the historic photos on the walls while you eat.</review>

I went to this diner today with my kids! Thought it looked very cute and retro definitely fits the Oceanside area. I was neglected by my waitress. It took me about 10 min to get a menu and when I went and grabbed one myself she seemed irritated. It took a little by time to get any kind of attention from her she walked with her head down and doesnt notice customers trying to get her attention. At one point someone who was also frustrated with her was trying to help me get her attention. My order was wrong also. The food was great. My only comment on my California omlet would be to break up the avacado. The whole one side was like a whole avacado. Didn’t mind too much because I love them.< /review>

I moved to North County 9 years ago and happily found this place, it was good, 9 years ago. The place has gone down hill ever since in food quality, quantity and service only going up a steep hill in price. Today was, sad to say, definitely  my last visit. I have never received a smile here. Today was the first time I got my toast WITH breakfast instead of for desert but dang, it was burnt and really, really small. My daughters french toast was smaller than a slice of wonder bread. My complete breakfast was NOT GOOD. It took over 40 min. for us to get our food and our order was the only one for the kitchen at the time. "Regulars" seem to be treated better than the average joe as evidenced by today's regulars Buddy the bulldog and his owner whom were served immediately upon entering the restaurant. Yes, Buddy the dog was served dog food from behind the counter in the restaurant (Buddy probably ate the best of anyone there today). The current stone faced waitress whom has been there for a long time as far as I can remember, is bouncing all over the place looking busy enough yet nothing is really happening, except the dog is getting stellar service on the floor from her (we were stuck there for over an hour mainly waiting for food and the check) and with all the activity by the waitress feeding, petting the dog etc. I never once saw the waitress wash her hands!
So, a couple of flavorless eggs, cold undercooked sausage, burnt, mini, dry sourdough toast (they don't butter it for you) and mushy, starchy hashbrowns along with mini french toast, a cup of coffee, an orange juice from a carton and "dirty" service for $25.00 without so much as a thank you of even a smile?
THANKS BUT NO THANKS.< /text>

I'm 66 years old and washed dishes there when I was a sophomore at Oceanside High. In an unfriendly world it's a delight to see smiles and be dealt with in a friendly manner.

< review>
I have been going to 101 for breakfast on sundays for the last year.  At first it was good but has steadily gone downhill in the last 6mos.  They don't cook with much seasoning so you have to really salt and pepper everything heavily.  The gravy is like tasteless paste.  Now they have started cutting back the portions and charging anywhere from 50c to 70c just to put a little extra gravy on the potatoes, which are dry so they need it.  On the last two visits, I noticed that the portions have been cut in at least half if not more.  I have eaten my last meal there.  It is just not worth the price anymore.< /review>

(Translated by Google) This cafeteria seems to be frozen in the 50's and that is what gives it personality. The waiters attend you kindly. The food is simple, unpretentious and with good taste. I ordered 2 fried eggs with potatoes and toast (Solo Cruise in the menu) and it is just what I got. The mural that is outside is very beautiful and inside it is possible to see very old photos of Oceanside. The "diner" takes its name from the California U.S. Route 101 that goes from San Diego to Oregon.
