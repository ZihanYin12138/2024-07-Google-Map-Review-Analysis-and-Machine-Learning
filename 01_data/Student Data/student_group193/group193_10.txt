A great little.dive bar with amazing Thai food. The bartender and chef was our gracious host. We got the Shrimp Wraps, Mama Noodle Soup, and Pad Kee Mow (drunken noodles). All of it was great. Shrimp Wraps were perfectly crispy. The soup was flavorful. The Pad Kee Mow was so delicious and spicy. Also tried a Thai lager and some Thai tea.

We will return. Mainly suggestion is not to bring a big group just because the staff is small, intimate, and friendly, so small groups may be best.</Text>

Incredible food, drinks, and service with a laid-back atmosphere in a family-run establishment, what’s not to love? We had the Chicken Kra Pow, Bat Wings, and Pork Jerky, all of which my companion, who has spent a great deal of time in Thailand swears is better than anything he’s had in Bangkok!

The atmosphere on a post-pandemic Monday night was enjoyably chill and laid back, but we were told that if you’re looking for a great party vibe to come in on the weekends. Either way, I can’t recommend this place enough!</Review>

<text>Went here with some friends and had some pretty amazing dishes. We started off with a papaya salad which was really good never was a fan, but this one was on point. We followed it with a very delicious tom-kha soup which had a very balanced taste of sour and creamy. We also had a very delicious tofu green curry, followed by drunken noodles that were really not drunken enough. All the places were amazing, but the drunken noodles they were pretty average.< /text>< Gmap_id>

It is relatively dark and looks more oriented towards drinking than eating. However, I soon discovered that the drink menu has several tasty original cocktails and that they have their own free parking lot behind the building. The bat wing appetizer was great with a dipping sauce that had a surprisingly complex flavor. Our entrees were also great. The pad see ewe was so tasty that I couldn't stop myself from polishing off the whole dish despite a level of spiciness that would usually stop me from eating more than half.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place had delicious food, and some good appetizer and drink deals for happy hour!  I would recommend the curry puff appetizer, pumpkin curry, and the crab fried rice. The mojito was also good. The Thai spiced corn fritter appetizers were fine, but didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>My wife and I frequented this establishment at their prior location.  The staff there was always nice and friendly.

My daughter, grandson and son in law visited the new location for a late lunch on 04-14-18.

While there, my daughter sent me a text stating that the owner overheard my grandson asking for french fries.  The owner took it upon herself to have fries delivered to the restaurant for my grandson to enjoy.

Thank you so much for being so kind to my grandson.  I am grateful for this small gesture of kindness. We will continue to patronize your establishment.

Sincerely,

Hello Angel, as a chef in a awesome LA reasturant and a person that is always in the look out for fun cool places to go hang with friends I was very happy to find Angels Cafe.
Not only does the place have a great look and Angel who was working the bar so nice.
The food is high quality.
Fresh from the vine vegi's chicken cooked just right and spicy noodles so yummy you'll want to go back asap.
Trust that you are in the hands of a staff that love giving you good hip vibe, music and awesome food.
If you are reading this go now.
You'll love it!<//Review>

<review>My second time here and I couldn't be more satisfied and happy with the results! The staff and service from beginning to end were super nice, and the salon had a good atmosphere. James took care of me again and did an amazing job with my hair color and treatment! The assistant helping out was also really sweet. He even gave me some tips on how to style my hair and better care for it! I liked that they were very attentive to the details so I'm super thrilled with the results overall! :)< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>I had a really great experience at Atelier By Tiffany. I suffer with psoriasis so I am always conscious when visiting a new salon. Eugene did my hair and was so lovely and careful around my scalp whilst still getting the colour I wanted (an ashy silver gray colour). I'm really pleased and would definitely come back again!< /Review><userid>118213325436318679767<//userid><Rating>4<//Rating>< resp>

This review is for So-Young. She's handles all the semi-permanent makeup clienteles. I've gotten my eyeliner and my eye brows done with a follow up touch up for both. She's been great and so pleasant to work with. I've referred about 7 of my friends here and they are all very pleased with her work. Her style is very versatile so she can accomplish any range of your style from natural to a more theatrical look. Keep in mind that it's semi permanent so it will probably last a couple years or more depending on your skin type.< /text>

After bleaching and coloring my hair was brittle and fizzy. Since I have a lot of hair, it made even more difficult to control my hair. James recommended keratin treatment for me and I decided to go for it. Unlike magic straight(chemical treatment that nearly takes 4 hrs to straighten hair with some degree of damage) keratin strengthened my hair with added shine and straightening effect as well. My hair felt and looked so beautiful. James is super calm and confident, and I can tell he really puts 100% effort for the best outcome. Great customer service and complimentary snacks served including good coffee. Two thumbs up for James and Atelier!!< /review><user_id>117246270577348089436</user_id><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

I've always had trouble finding "the right" salon but I think that search has came to an end, thanks to VIVIAN from Atelier. She has great customer service & gave me exactly what I asked for. I will most definitely be coming back. Highly recommend her!!</Text>

<review>I needed a major makeover! So my friend referred me to Yoon. I had some doubts at first but i went to see Yoon. She was very nice, easy to talk to and has a great sense of humor. I got a cut and a perm, She gave me a lot of tips on how to take care of my hair. I loved how my hair looked when it was done! So i love my new look!! And everyone there is nice and professional! I will definitely go back!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1602744305756<//time></record>

I've done by hair multiple times at this location and I've never had a bad experience. I've done a ombré which I asked to be very natural since the nature of my job wouldn't allow for a very flashy hair style and it was delivered! I also have done magic straight which left my hair even more healthy than I came in with! I also do my eyebrow and eyeliner tattoo here which I am obsessed with! Makes getting ready very easy! I definitely recommend this place to anyone!<//Text>

I've been going to SSOONIE for all my hair cut and color for over 3 years now.  this artfully crafted location is sugar, whip cream and cherry on top to go with the skill set  and the professionalism that Soon provides.  He will take his time to actually "study" your hair to maximize and utilize your appearance. I can't always make it to this location, but when i do get my hair done from Soon, i always receive the most compliments.  I've always had the same hair style (spike/fohawk) for years before him, but now my hair style and color has definetly taken the 21st centry leap into more modern and stylish style :) **definetly recommend setting an appointment on his busy schedule**<//review>

Okay, so its been two weeks since my rollerblading with Rachel. I am super excited! My eyebrows look so natural and have healed wonderfully. Rachel provided a healing ointment and it worked. I had minimal scabbing. I go back in another two weeks for my one month follow up/touch up. I'm so glad I chose Rachel. Also you can't beat the price.<//Review>

<text>I came to Ssoonie after hearing raving reviews about the magic he creates by turning dark hair very light with minimum damage. While my expectations were high, I never thought that I'd be blown away. I had a very difficult request of wanting my damaged bleach blond hair (damaged from another salon) turned a light silver Gray blonde. Ssoonie was very realistic and honest about what he felt comfortable doing with my hair so as not to further damage it and told me he would try to get my hair as close to the color as he possibly could to keep it healthy. The result was exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier. My hair is a luxurious silver blond without a trace of gold and zero brassiness... Im in love with it and I get compliments every where I go! I'm so happy I found Ssoonie and an so grateful I trusted him to fix my hair! I'll be going to him religiously from now on :)</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Excellent service, clean, and attentive to your needs. I originally came in for just a cut, but Mina persuaded me to color my hair as well and I'm glad she did! Only down fall was the price of the color... other than that, would Sheila Bella Permanent Makeup recommend going to Atelier by Sheila Bella Permanent Makeup .< /Text>

Had haircut with Mina today and she is super attentive. Got a haircut: she left the length of how I wanted it as well as natal age . I was actually really afraid that it would be too crazy but she kept it really natural. Will def come back :) her assistant Hyundai was super awesome too!</review>

Boonies is the man! I have been looking for a good place to take care my hair since I moved to CA. And I'm glad that I found him. I always find the hairstyle I want online and he did exactly the same as what I showed him, which is actually not an easy thing for most of the stylists.</text>

< Review>
I'm struggling to find the right words, but there are none. I went to Sheila Bella last year for my initial microblading experience. I was very happy to finally have brows. I didn't return for my follow up visit until 2 days ago. I am SO happy with how my eyebrows look now. Don't get me wrong. I was happy with my first visit, but I'm ecstatic with the final results. Very little pain during the procedure and everything was explained very thoroughly so there were NO surprises. I will continue going to Sheila Bella in the future for touch ups because I observed the professionalism that the whole Sheila Bella staff has with their clientele. No matter what request I had, it was met with enthusiasm, not disdain. Keep up the good work ladies. I just can't explain how I feel now, going out in public and not worrying if my eyebrows "are still on". Thank you so much for everything.< /Review>

<text>They just got a new line of pigments in 😍
The colors are very rich and aren't ashy.
I love Sheila Bella because of how sincerely nice everyone is there. They're patient and care about the way YOU want your permanent make done! They have all the cool gadgets to properly mark your brows and take their time, no rushing you out the door like other places!
Jen was even like, "Do you have a little extra time? I really want to soak the pigment in again!"
I'm a very loyal client once I love somewhere! And I love this place!
**DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL OR COFFEE, NO CAFFEINE AT ALL 48 HOURS PRIOR!!
You will bleed your pigment out and it might come out splotchy!<//text>< user>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Best decision ever!  Look no further, I am in love with my eyebrows. I went  to Sheila Bella last month and I went back for my touch up yesterday. My experience is great. Pain is hardly there, whatever technique Sheila is using is working . The staff are super friendly, responsive and knowledgeable. My healing took about 4 weeks. I really appreciate how they explained the healing process to me after my initial session. Everything that they said happened. I would have panicked in the middle of my healing had they not explained what I will go through . Now I can just go to the gym and still look great , sweat and all. How amazing is that?< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the location. Otherwise this place is super cool. Very nicely decorated. The staff is very professional yet sweet and casual. A perfect combination for this type of business. MY technician/artist Stephanie is awesome. She's professional, compassionate and patient. She did an awesome job (eyebrows). I highly recommend her and this location. Thanks again ladies. You guys Rock!!</text>

I came in yesterday super nervous and excited and walked out completely HAPPY!! Complementary valet at the North Hollywood location, super convenient.   The minute you walk in you're greeted and made to feel comfortable, staff is so lovely! Sheila did an incredible job on my eyebrows!! 🤗 she took her time and we agreed on my shape and color. The numbing cream did help a bit but still a little pain, I expected that since it is permanent make up. Finishing product was GREAT! Especially when it came down to covering up my scar. Overall Sheila was amazing ,took her time and made feel comfortable and now even more confident about my brows. ✨😊< /review>

< Review>
I did an incredible amount of research before I chose Sheila Bella for permanent makeup. They far exceeded my already high expectations. My friends couldn't believe how natural my face looked immediately after and then after the full healing process. I still get that reaction every time I tell people I had microblading done. You absolutely cannot tell and they saved my face from the overplucking in high school. It blended it into my hair so perfectly.
Julie was my artist...I am posting this after having my first appointment and the touch up. I also came back 2 years later for a touch up because my right brow was fading a bit. I go running outside and don't always use sun screen so it's not something they did wrong, I don't think. Everyone heals differently. On their website you can see that they work on lots of high profile people.
Can't even explain how great these guys are. Incredibly professional. They were in this game very early on, and know exactly what they are doing.<//Review>

I got my brows done on Tuesday 4/18 by Sheila. I was fortunate enough to be chosen as a brow model. Not only is their work amazing, they give back to the everyday girl like me. First off my main concern was pain because I'm such a chicken!! They numb you with topical first and then the first pass they numb you more. Once they start the microblading  you can hardly feel a thing. Some parts are more sensitive like the arch and inner corner of your brow but it's over so quickly!! All of the girls are so sweet and make sure your needs are met. Sheila is a perfectionist and who doesn't want their eyebrows to look perfect!! She redrew them multiple times until she got the exact shape I wanted. I'm so happy with my results. They offer valet parking at their north Hollywood location which is very convenient.< /Text>

I got my brows done for the first time by Stephanie almost two weeks ago! And let me just say that it was the best decision I ever made! I love how they're so detailed about the healing process on how to take good care of them. My brows are healing wonderful! Stephanie did an amazing job! The numbing cream they applied worked wonders, didn't feel a thing. I can't wait to go back for my touch up!!!< /review>

Getting my brows done has been such a time saver!  I got microblading done about a year and a half ago to even up my eyebrows (one side was naturally growing higher than the other).  Since then, its been so easy to get out of the house in the mornings.  I only wear makeup on my brows when I feel like trying out a new look, otherwise I can just get-up-and-go!< /text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Pros: Very friendly staff and technicians. So great service for that part. Both locations have convenient parking.

Cons: One star for the product. I had lips and eyebrows done. Neither made any difference. I had microbalding the first two visits. The pigment faded both times. We tried the powder technique instead. It is a little more costly but they did not charge me. I did a couple visits for that. When I left the salon each time my eyebrow shape was perfection. However as soon as my brows healed, pigment never stayed. I paid $1300 for both eyebrows and lips and neither made any change. I still have to fill in brows every morning.<//review>< Pics>

This review is long over due! I had by brows done over 2 years ago and it was the best decision I've ever made. It made my getting ready time so much shorter! I had a color boost appointment with Sheila this summer and it brought my brows back to life. The numbing technique is so effective, I didn't feel any pain! I would do it again and recommend Sheila Bella to anyone who wants to have perfect brows 24/7! Thank you Sheila for giving me my dream brows!</review>

Sheila Bella is AWESOME!! Thank you so much Julie! Your work is perfection! The moment i walked in the front door i  felt welcomed and was treated like a celebrity. They start off buy taking pics of your face pertaining to what services you are having done. They offer drinks and snacks while you wait and everyone is super sweet. I love my hair stroke eyebrows they are perfect. Definitely considering lipstain next!! Keep up the excellent customer service .</Review>

I believe when your doing something permanent to your face, it should be well reviewed and well thought through. Sheila Bella is an amazing artist. I came to her for help to solve my sparse eyebrow dilemma and she did just that. She made my eyebrows look so natural that not even my family members can tell it was a tattoo. The most talented work in my opinion is work that looks natural and beautiful. If your looking for natural permanent eyebrows look no further ;)

I have had my brows done prior to this and they never had the color enough to not add make-up. I chose this place because I wanted to pay top dollar for professional work and my brows are completely done and healed and I am still drawing over them to add color. I did tell them I wanted really dark so I don't have to draw them anymore.  I gave sheilabella 3 stars because the experience is awesome! It a a very beautiful classy establishment.  They take their time to do proper measurements and you don't feel any pain whatsoever during the procedure. Everyone is extremely courteous and professional. Here are my before and after pictures. Total out the door is payed $900 ($100 for tip). So you be the judge if you think these brows look good enough to pay that kind of money...<//review>< Pics>

Getting my eyebrows microbladed at Sheila Bella Brows was the BEST DECISION!! I wish I had done it sooner. I don’t do any other cosmetic procedures on my face so I was nervous, but the professionalism of the entire staff put me at ease.  My artist, Julie, is a true perfectionist and I was blown away by the precision techniques they use to perfect your brow design. In person you cannot tell the difference between my eyebrows and the ink, even when you look really closely! As a fashion model, this makes a huge difference for me and the make-up artists because my eyebrow shape is already symmetrical. All I have to do is fill them in when I want a bolder look. And since I don’t wear makeup on a daily basis I wake up with natural, beautiful brow. Side effects include boost in confidence, ease of makeup application and overall happiness</Text>

I got my eyebrows redid (had previous work done) and Sheila did work! She is seriously an artist. I feel more confident with my new brows and the cover up job from my old ones. I'm going back today for my touchup and I'm excited to see how they will look. Not sure they can look any better. Sheila and her staff are super sweet and they take care of you from the time you get there until you leave. They even did a follow up call the after I received my first procedure. So please with the world class service.< /Text>

Microblading has changed my life so much. I naturally have very fine, sparse, blonde brows which appeared nonexistent. I never knew how to do my brows and never even got them waxed (mostly because I have almost no hair to begin with). My solution was bangs for about 6 years. Then, after finding out about Sheila Bella through IG, I decided to give it a go. The results were INCREDIBLE. My family had no idea. My mom even came in to get hers done after seeing my results !! Microblading is a great solution for any woman at any age  and i promise you IT WILL CHANGE YOUR MORNING ROUTINE AND SELF CONFIDENCE. :)< /Review>

just got my brows microbladed by Sheila and it was the most positive experience I could have asked for!! She is so patient and knowledgeable. I really felt heard and cared for as I hemmed and hawed about all the decisions that go into it— the shape, the width, the color: my mind saw so many ways I could mess this up! But Sheila talked me through it, listened to my opinions, and then used her expertise to help us figure out together what would make me happiest. SO RARE AND AMAZING!

I seriously can not recommend her highly enough. I am still in the first week of my treatment, so I’m in the scanning phase, but I STILL get stopped at least once a day by people wanting to go where I went.

Thank you, Sheila!!<//review>

I took my mom as a birthday gift. The shape that they did was not what we asked for they said it was going to thin out after so we approved it. My mom was not happy with everything....too painful..pigment faded after 3 months so we tried the powder look and it faded too. When went the first time my mom cried and didn't wanted to come out because her eyebrows were not pretty at all.</text>

<Review>I was so,  so nervous going in but from the moment I spoke to the girls behind the counter I felt welcomed and more at ease when I met Leslie, she explained the entire procedure and helped me decide between òmbre and microblading. I am perfectly happy with what I chose.  I have already recommended  Sheila Bella to family members and friends . I can't wait to go back for my touch up. Thank you Leslie !< /Review>< Rate>

<Date>1555149850996<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Went here to get my eyebrows done since all the beautiful pictures on Instagram but my eyebrows are not symmetrical at all they're so crooked. In my eyes I look ugly and I have pictures to prove what I'm saying it makes me sad everytime I look in the mirror. When I put on makeup I have to always try to fix my eyebrows it's really sad and upsetting because it's not like they can get rubbed off. Hopefully one day when I get the money I'll try to get them fixed. I'm so disappointed

Update 04/13/2019

No offense to you guys at Sheila Bella. I did get my eyebrows done there. This email is not my personal email. I use this for YouTube and other things. I did end up getting my eyebrows redone somewhere else. I'm not going to promote them out of respect to your business. But I'm not lying I'm being honest my eyebrows did not look symmetrical and now they do because I got them fixed somewhere else. Don't get me wrong all your staff is very nice,  polite,  and even my eyebrow specialist was awesome. The snacks are free and very beautiful office.  but my eyebrows didn't come out as I expected that's all. I payed alot just to feel disappointed. It was just bad luck maybe others had great eyebrows done but I didn't. Sorry for this comment but it's true in my case<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1520965418720, 'text': 'Hi Melina!

<text>Wow! What more can I say?! Sheilabella was the best decision I ever made. I had gotten my eyebrows done twice back in the 90's and thankfully pretty much all of it had faded. So I knew it was time to get them redone and this time I was going to get them done the RIGHT way!

From beginning to end I had the best experience! All the staff were so welcoming and answered all my questions. My artist shaped my eyebrows and we worked together to achieve the outline I wanted. She showed me several colors we decided together on what was the best one to choose. The procedure itself wasn't at all what I was expecting. If anything it felt like tweezing. I was so relieved.

After my big reveal I couldn't believe how natural they looked. It was even better than I had expected! I'm so in love with my brows! Thank you Sheilabella for everything! Will definitely be telling all my girlfriends to come!<//text>< Rate>

<text>Terrible!! Eyebrows look super fake and ugly! If you even just look at the google pictures you can see how bad they look! You can see the strokes they use. VERY painful, they cut WAY too deep and leave you bleeding which is INCORRECT! Took good care of them and still only lasted 8 months when they're supposed to last 1-3 years. Also it was super expensive at the cost of $1000, kind staff but not good at what they do. Was almost not about to get them redone because of the terrible experience here, but then saw how good @krysbrows (on instagram) microbladed so got them done there, a million times better, way more realistic brows and so much less painful! Strongly recommend getting them done there. Please listen to my advice, I'm just trying to help a sister out. <3<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>I was super nervous the day I got my eyebrows microbladed. Which I should've given it more thought instead of going with a complete stranger tattooing my face! Don't get me wrong she seemed to know what she was doing, but all that proved wrong. My eyebrows faded to a dark ashy grey color instead of the brown ink she used. It's been 3weeks now and I honestly wish I'd never had them done. They look horrible! I can't even cover them up with brow product bc the grey ink color is so dark. In top of all that...she tattooed two totally different shapes on my face! I cry everytime I look in the mirror! And to think I paid someone to do this to me. Wow!<//review>< Name>

< Review>
If it were possible to make a zero star review I would. Before I came to Sheila Bella I had perfectly fine eyebrows. I just wanted them to be a little darker and more defined. I saw their posts on Instagram, I saw the videos and when I saw the 399 special I said why not. On the day of my appointment I was scared, and so nervous because I was about to get a freaking tattoo on my face. The tech Leslie hardly talked to me and reassured me throughout the process. The only time she spoke with me was when I needed to approve the shape and color. I showed her exactly how I wanted the stokes to look like and how I wanted them shaped. Yes I approved the shape and yes I approved the color. What I did not approve of was the thickness of the stokes. Since they were taping me for the special of course I acted like I was ok with the brows. As soon as I got into my car I started crying. The hair strokes were so aggressively thick. I was embarrassed to even lift my head up as I walked to my car. I had to spend two and a half weeks hiding from everyone because I didn't want them to notice these chola like sharpie eyebrows. The only thing consoling me was thinking they will fade...they will thin out. NOPE. They did not thin out. What I have on my face are not even realistic hair strokes but LINES. I know the manager or whoever will reply to this with "I must get the touch up to make them look better, It's a process" Why the hell would I go back and PAY 200 for a touch up and go through that embarrassment on my face for two and a half weeks again. Even if I did decided to go back and get it done with Sheila herself, I would have to pay ANOTHER 100 bucks just to switch techs. I was not satisfied at all with how they came out in the first place. Not only did my eyebrows have A LOT of scabbing, but when the scabs did come off, it ripped off my real hair with them. What I am left with are these aggressive lines on my face which I will have to pay to get taken off now. Please, please, please do your research when it comes to microblading.</Review>

<Review>I had an awesome customer service experience at this Sprint location thanks to Mireya. She answered my questions and helped me choose the best plan for me. It can be a bit frustrating looking for the right plan and device but Mireya made that process easy with her expertise. Thank you for your help. I highly recommend this Sprint location!</Review><Name>Jorge Ivan<//Name>< Response>

We had lost so much faith in Sprint because of bad customer service and horrible past experiences with their sales people.  Decided to give Sprint one last chance and we came across ANDREA GARCIA, she was formerly at a Chula Vista store.  She went above and beyond to make sure we left the store with the right phones and service for my family.  She restored our trust in Sprint.  I feel like the people at the Chula Vista corporate store have a lot to learn from Andrea as far as quality sales and customer service goes.  Andrea is now my go-to for any cell needs.  Go see her and you won't regret it!</review>

I came in the store hesitant about switching phone companies, but I came in a few days ago and Tito was able to help me out. He was very approachable and friendly. He showed me deals that sprint had to offer and decided to stay with the company after all. Amazing customer service!!</Review>

Great service!
Tito went above and beyond to make sure we were completely satisfied! He took the time to answer all our questions and made sure we knew how our devices worked before we left. He told us about all the deals and advised us to do what was best for our family plan.

Thank you!< /Text>

They told me over the phone, you get a additional $350 dollars of the iPhone 10, I told them I was a sprint carrier, and I wanted the iPhone 10 with the $350 discount. So I drove to the store, and when I got there, they told me the $350 discount where for people who belong to other carriers, and would get the discount if they switched over to sprint. I was so pissed of, I drove to the dam store for nothing, hoping I would get the iPhone 10, with the $350 discount promotion. What a bunch of idiots. Never coming back to this store again :(</Review>

<Review>Untruthful sales tactics to entice upgrading after the company collects excessive payments after an 18 month lease but since I didn't respond to an email it's the customers fault although other employees told me the payment would automatically drop off.

(Translated by Google) I had problems with my phone account and they couldn't help me over the phone. I went to the store in the Americas and Gilberto "Tito" Lizarraga attended me very kindly and could help me a lot with the problem in my account.

If I ever have another problem, I go straight to him.

Thank you

(Translated by Google) I am very grateful to the young Tito Lizarraga who assisted me at Sprint.

I am a lady of the third age, technology and English is not my strong suit. However, the young man attended me in the best way and above all he had patience

Young people like these should be rewarded for their kindness and attention.

Thank you Tito

Estoy muy agradecida con el joven Tito Lizarraga que me atendió en Sprint.

Soy una Sra de la 3ra edad, la tecnología y el inglés no es mi fuerte. Más sin embargo el joven me atendió de la mejor manera y sobre todo me tubo paciencia

Jóvenes como estos deberían de ser premiados por su amabilidad y atención.

Thank You Tito</text>

This is recommended by my brother, who loved your wine, and I can see why. The tasting was exceptional. Kyle, our host, was excellent and took the time to explain and answer all of our questions. We have a case being shipped home as we speak. Can’t wait to come again. Highly recommended without reservation<//text>

We visited 9 wineries during our visit to Napa and James Cole was by far our favorite.  Very inviting and tranquil venue.  Service was excellent and the host was fantastic.  Not to mention the wine selection was awesome.  We will be visiting again in the near future.  We highly recommend you visit.<//Review>

<Text>I am hosting a party of five in September and selected this winery arbitrarily because it has small case production and was more intimate and personal than many of the winery tastings.....I wasn't disappointed in the least.....Dustin was our guide through the wines and we found him personable, knowledgeable and most importantly.....a truly gracious and informative host.....this is a "should not miss stop".<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1628134275856, 'text': 'Thanks so much for this really kind and thoughtful review, Gary!

< Review>
Four of us (two couples) participated in a private tasting September 2019 were really impressed not only with the quality wines that were poured, but also the AWESOME tasting room environment! The '59 vette, vintage bikes, and Rolling Stones pinball all add to the most immersive tasting experience that we had that entire week in the Napa Valley.  Yes, we were very happy to ship several cases of Superb James Cole Wine (The Suede is HUGE) back home and continue to place orders as value options are presented.  A "must-do" experience when you visit Napa!</Review>

<text>James Cole was our first stop on the day we decided to ride bikes between wineries on the Silverado trail. We had a lovely time sitting outside in the shade on the beautiful patio with so many different flowers. It was a great place to rest and enjoy the scenery stationary after a 40 minute bike ride or so- and the wines were great! Our host was very charismatic and knowledgeable about the wine and spent a lot of time talking with us. Would highly recommend a trip out to James Cole.< /text>< pictures>

James Cole is one of the BEST Cabernet's I've experienced.  On our visit to their winery, we had a wonderful time learning about their vineyards.  The special tasting they set up in advance was one of our best experiences.

Great wines of all varietals, wonderful and knowledgeable staff, beautiful tasting room, overall a GREAT experience.  I highly recommend a visit whether on line or in person.  Order any of their wines and you will not be disappointed!!< /text>

Excellent experience at this beautiful winery. Staff greeted us upon entry, and escorted us to a personal session. Upon there, they do give you a list of wines for the tasting. In addition the staff will fully explain the wines, but then takes it further and understand the science behind male and female taste buds. This was particularly interesting because my wife and I do enjoy different styles of wines.

The location is set off of the road “a hidden gem” in plain site with a beautiful scenery.  Also, their symbol and the meaning behind it lives up to the how well the winery functions.

I’m happy we found this place. Well, my first time and my wife second time after her “ladies” trip with the family.

You will enjoy it there.<//review>

<Text>We've been visiting James Cole for years now -- there's really nothing like it. We pour their wine often at dinner parties and gatherings and it is loved by all. While we mainly enjoy their wines at home, we also love going to the winery every once in awhile. The staff is fun/unpretentious and the tasting room and grounds are beautiful. If you are looking for unique, high-quality wines and a laid back, not touristy tasting - this is your place.</Text>< Rating>

The wines at James Cole are excellent and the service is wonderful.  I have enjoyed the different reds many of which are very interesting blends.  The Rosé is delicious.

In addition the tastings at the winery and private virtual tastings have both been great.  My family and I have enjoyed the stories and the wine knowledge imparted during these visits.

I would highly recommend to anyone interested in drinking and learning about great wine to visit James Cole, purchase their wine online, or join the club.< /text>

I've been a member of James Cole wine club since the first time I tried the selections. Not only are the vineyard and tasting room first class and stunning but the wines are all impeccable. They are always a go to wine when we have company and are the selection of choice from the 1,200 bottle wine cellar I've amassed since visiting Napa Valley throughout the years.</text>

<Text>I must thank my sister for introducing me to James Cole Winery many, many, many years ago. I remember waking into the tasting room and Ozzy was playing in the background and I thought, “Now this is my kind of winery.”  I had already been drinking their wine, courtesy of my sis, so I knew how phenomenal they were. It quickly became my favorite winery and tasting experience, and has stayed my favorite, and now is my husbands favorite as well.

The staff is amazing, knowledgeable and laid back. The owners, we consider friends💕. Spending time at the winery with all of them is one of our best afternoons!< /Text>< pics>

If you are heading to the Napa Valley, don't leave this treasure off your list. Not only are the wines some.of the best in the valley, but the whole tasting experience is perfection. Totally worth sitting outside if you can and enjoying your tasting.  You’ll also meet some.of the coolest wine peeps making the whole.tasting a ton of fun. We didn't even want to leave for our next tasting. Cheers!< /review>

Visiting the winery before the pandemic was the best decision I ever made as now I continue to receive their wines during these difficult times!  To this day, I look forward to my regular wine shipments as the James Cole wines are without comparison.  They are full bodied reds with tastes that suit the most picky wine drinker but also the person who is a novice and just wants a great glass of wine.< /text>

<review>James Cole Winery is always on the top of our list to visit when in Napa!  Intimate tasting experience with amazing red wines that have a beautiful finish.  We had an incredible virtual wine tasting when we were unable to travel there...impeccable customer service.  Great wine club with flexibility on selection.  You will want a “revisit” with James Cole!</review>< Pictures>

We have really enjoyed James Cole’s wines now for over seven years. Their Cabs are full bodied with a great smooth finish. Their Rose wine is crisp with undertones of stone fruit and are very refreshing during the hot summer months.</Text>

My wife and I have been members for over 7 years.  James Cole is our favorite for so many reasons: (1) The grounds are just beautiful and peaceful (2) The manager, Dustin, along with every individual we have ever worked with ordering wine or tasting at the winery has been exceptional.  So friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond and last but not least (3) While they don't need to JC always offers wonderful extra discounted wine purchasing specials.

If you are looking to get away from the large commercial wine companies you absolutely can not do any better than James Cole.  I'd stack their wines against any big name trendy winery.<//Review>

James Cole is one of our favorite wines. Their Cabernet and Rose are the best around. We’ve given them as gifts over the years as well as enjoyed it time and again ourselves. Always a staple in our wine fridge.  Keep up the great work, we can’t wait to visit again.< /text>

Have made multiple trips to James Cole. Outstanding service, hospitality and wine. The combination of the variety and quality stands out and never disappoints. James Cole keeps it simple and without any pretentiousness while maintaining all that is important in any wine tasting experience. It's been a must-stop during our annual trip to Napa Valley every year.<//Text>

<text>My family and I had a wonderful time at James Cole Winery. Our group of six enjoyed a tasting as well as a short tour. As James Cole is a boutique winery, we were able to enjoy our tasting in intimate settings, having an entire patio to ourselves for nearly our whole visit. The wine was of course delicious, with the 2016 Cab and 2015 Il Mostro being particular highlights. Our host Dustin was gracious, funny and totally unpretentious despite our group's general lack of knowledge about wine. He even took us to the vineyard to taste some early wine grapes. I absolutely recommend visiting and I'll definitely be back.</text><Gmap_id>0x808501057cc3d49d:0x6b3cc1e09ad745eb< /Gmap_id>< Response>

When we find ourselves in Napa, we ALWAYS find time to visit James Cole Winery!  Not only are their wines delicious, the people are so, so friendly and make you feel like you are their only customer!  We never feel hurried and always bring out of town visitors to enjoy with us!  Keep doing what you are doing!!<//review>

Dustin is an amazing host and he is part of what makes Napa Valley great!

The wines are red focused and fairly diverse as in there is something here for everyone.

James Cole Winery is what comes to mind when I think of a family winery in it's wines, tradition and staff.

<text>This place is amazing. They have been our longest standing wine club (3+ years?)because their wine is really that good. Mostly big reds (cabs, malbecs, Bordeaux blends) but their rose is killer, too.

The winery is super chill, not pretentious at all, great yard with bocce court to hang out. Their events are super fun. Dustin in the tasting room is great conversation and they have a super cute dog who likes pets.

Make an appointment and check them out!<//text><rate>5<//rate>< date>

This place was my favorite winery that we attended while visiting Napa. The grounds and property are just beautiful and well maintained. The wine was high quality which made the tasting worth the value. We were able to relax and take our time. Dustin was fun and personable as he talked to us and introduced each wine. At the end, he even chose a special wine for each of us based on our tastes. I highly recommend.</text>

James Cole is hands down our FAVORITE winery in Napa! We heard about this winery several years ago from a coworker of my husbands. After the first visit, we became wine club members and have enjoyed every wine they have sent to us. The winery grounds are spectacular and we have so enjoyed taking our friends with us...so much so several have also joined the wine club!
We look forward to getting back to Napa soon but until then, we will continue enjoying our wonderful wines delivered by our favorite Fed Ex driver😂

James Cole Winery has been one of our favorite wineries in Napa Valley, in fact the entire world.  Great people, wonderful hospitality, and exceptional  wines.  Year after year it seems as if the quality of their wine making just gets better and better. We try to visit every time we are in Napa. Highly recommend a visit to explore how good they can be.<//Review>

<review>I am from Washington State and while we have amazing wines, James Cole is still one of my favorite. The first time I was here was for my sisters 40th birthday. The atmosphere is amazing and welcoming, I look forward to going back.
Now onto the wine. What is not to love, I have wine shipped to Washington on a regular basis. One of my favorites is the Privado. This wine pairs well with everything, especially a steak. The rose is one of my other favorites.
I anxiously await for the email that says there is a new release.
You have everything you need at this winery. Go enjoy!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>James Cole is my favorite winery to visit in Napa (and I visit a lot of wineries!). The staff is personable, knowledgeable and friendly, the setting is beautiful (insta-worthy) and the wines are amazing. I cannot recommend this experience enough!<//Review>< Pics>

We had a wonderful wine tasting session at James Cole during a chilly, fall day this past weekend.  Dustin guided through the tasting.  All the wines were superb. Dustin also provided wonderful pairing suggestions for us that we cannot wait to try.  So many wines that I hadn't had from James Cole before.  Took three different varietals home.The social distancing measures were sound.</review>

<Review>When I think about what makes a winery a great winery, I think about: 1. quality of the wine, 2. overall experience, 3. wine club member experience, and 4. interest in returning.

1. The wine is fantastic. My wife and I primarily drink cabernet and cabernet blends, and the reds really stand out. they're complex and long lasting (except in my glass).

2. The experience onsite at the winery is memorable. From the architecture to the staff to the view. It's a memory that comes back each time I have a glass of 2016 Cabernet.

3. We joined as club members, and not only have kept up the membership (not always the case everywhere) but often add bottles to the shipment. The whole team is super responsive whenever I have a question.

4. Would we return? Absolutely! And we tell all of our friends about them!

Keep up the work James Cole, and keep those shipments coming!< /Review><user_name>Nate Smith< /user_name><Response>{'time': 1618624032633, 'text': 'Hi Nate, you are truly kind for your words about our wines and property.

We can't wait to have you back to share some IL Mostro and pinball."}< /Resp><Text>We were tasting in Napa and our guide arranged a stop at James Cole. That’s when my life changed. The tasting room opened into a movie screening barn, where many of the wines are mixed to perfection. After I tore myself away from the pinball machine and looking at the vintage autos, we sat for our tasting. The wines were perfectly paired with cheeses, while our James Cole expert told us about the process of bringing each wine to life.
This winery had been our last stop of the day and we purchased the Il Mostro (aka “the monster”) to have with dinner that night. We were not disappointed and in fact, called back to join their wine club. We’ve been members for several years now, and have come back to try all of their selections and enjoy the beautiful winery grounds. Each of their wines are unique and personal (named after their children, grandma, etc.) and we have yet to find a wine here that doesn’t just blow us away with the depth of flavor and finish. I believe we are now lifers for James Cole wine and we’ll continue to introduce friends and family to this amazing gem - but not too many so we can still visit when we want to!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>James Cole is very much a hidden gem in the sea of Napa Valley wineries. With a maddeningly talented team, they craft some of the finest small production wines in California and arguably the world! We visit every time we go to Napa and are never disappointed. Plan to take your time here though, as hours can seem like minutes while enjoying one of the many stories from their incredible staff, as you taste such incredible juice. My personal favorite....the PRIVADO, a right bank blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot sourced from top vineyards in Napa. It will blow you away. Friends of mine that I’ve introduced to James Cole now complained that they’ve become spoiled by “the good stuff” and can’t go back to “the swill” they used to drink! Cheers to James and Colleen and the entire team at James Cole Winery. Can’t wait to go back.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1619188535860, 'text': 'Hi Nicholas, thanks for the kind words of support!

<Text>My wife and I have been visiting both Napa and Sonoma for the past 30 years. We live in the midwest and rarely find smaller production wines. During our numerous trips we learned to ask different wineries to suggest other wineries we should visit. While in Sonoma at one of the best zinfadel producers, I asked the tasting room host to recommend his favorite Cabernet Sauvignon producer. He stated James Cole Winery won that designation hands down!
We arranged a tasting for the following day. Wow, we were blown away by the phenomenal wines and the friendly tasting room staff. We purchased wines to take with us and regretted we did not join the wine club at that time.
The following summer I celebrated my birthday by bringing my entire nuclear family to Napa/Sonoma for a wine experience. My sons were both very knowledgeable about wines while the majority of the group were novices, we had a total of 17 people. We planned a visit to James Cole on Wednesday. Again we were blown away by a tasting of some of the best Cabs we had ever tasted, blends were great also.With the large group again I hesitated joining the wine club however when we returned on Friday with only a few dedicated wine consumers, I signed up.
I have been a member of many clubs over the years, they come and go. The wines change as does the quality.
For the past 5 years I have been a member of the Coalition Wine Club at James Cole. Not once have I ever been disappointed in any bottle of their wine I have opened. I have my favorites, my wife has hers and when our children visit, they always open a James Cole from the cellar. Keep up the dedication to great wines. You are truly my favorite Napa producer!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1619283019924, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your support!

I'm a HUGE James Cole fan! We've been members for 4 years and have loved every minute (sip) of it. Dustin is such a wonderful host - I've brought countless friends and family to the winery over the years and the tasting experience is always the best one of the trip. The setting is gorgeous, the people (and dogs) are so lovely - very personable and knowledgable, and of course the wine is un-matched. Our 'house wine' is Il Mostro in the winter and Rose in the summer. We love James Cole.<//Review>

James Cole is very nice winery to visit in Napa.  Their outdoor seating areas are very spread out amongst a very nice garden setting.  Their indoor seating is very nice with a rustic vibe, my favorite is a small patio area just off the indoor tasting area.  Their staff are very knowledgeable especially Dustin!  Their wines are very unique and are everything I like in reds and whites!  Their Cabs, blends and Malbec were fantastic.  Their Chardonnay is very nice and my wife really enjoyed it.  I highly recommend trying James Cole, you won’t be disappointed.  I highly recommend trying the IL Mostro and Privado!< /review>

Amazing wines, beautiful setting and the best staff in all of Napa! We've been members of JC for about 10 years and it just keeps getting better and better. James and Colleen are the epitome of the Napa dream. They put their heart and soul into the winery and it shows.  Not only are the wines phenomenal, the tasting experience is too.  Dustin made sure we felt right at home at our last tasting (as always) and made the experience extra special for our first time guests.  We are always excited to share of our love of James Cole with others...but not too many because we love the initmate experience which is vastly different from a large, commercial winery.  If in the area, make sure to put James Cole on your short list.  You will not be disappointed!<//Review>

Of all of the wineries we have visited in the Napa Valley, James Cole holds a special place in our journey as wine enthusiasts.  The best description I can come up with is "winemaking with attitude".  On the lighter side, their roses and chardonnay stand apart from retail labels.  The chardonnay has a hint of butter without overdoing it and the rose is extremely drinkable and refreshing.  Where JC knocks it out of the park is on their reds.  The Marls red blend is tastefully bold for those who aren't into lots of tannins, but remains complex, unlike most red blends.  The cabs, some of which are actually barrel-fermented, possess character right at the point of release and have the foundations to age to be even better when laid down.  My personal favorite is the JC Malbec which I would call a "power rock" red. At a middle price point, it's bold and complex without being overwhelming.  We drink some immediately and lay the rest down.  We discovered this amazing boutique winery on our first visit to the valley and it remains our favorite.  We simply love both the vibe and the wine.< /text>

<Review>James Cole is a member of the upper echelon of Napa Valley wineries. It’s location at the southern end of the Silverado Trail is coveted and the small stone winery and tasting room exude a cool and sophisticated vibe. The grounds are just lovely. You’ll find that the staff are friendly, enthusiastic and well-trained veterans of the industry. If you’re in search of a varietal not on Cole’s menu or just need a restaurant recommendation, these are the folks to ask. James Cole’s wine offerings are broad but not too broad. Enjoy their powerful Napa cab or rich blends, well-textured Chardonnay, delicate Sauvignon Blanc and really interesting Pinot. Oh, and try the newish rose. All a great treat and often at a very competitive price point. Cheers!

James Cole has a strong line up of wine.  We have been buying since 2016.  Very consistent excellent wine.  We make up a booklet to score the wine, rate the host, and the winery ambiance.  We consistently rate their wines in the 90s and up to 98!  The Cabernet, Privado and the Malbec are my favorites!  The Marls, Tyson and Il Mastro are easy everyday wine.  I do miss the Petit Verdot!  Dustin and the crew are great.  Note: when we go to Napa.....we always visit James Cole for a tasting!!!!!< /text>

In my humble opinion, JCW is the quintessential Napa Valley winery. The only thing I wish is if I had found it sooner. My wife and I are in Napa quite often and when we have friends with us, it is a must for us to make the stop at JCW. Suede is my favorite cab in all of the valley. The winery has a wine for everyone’s pallet. I’m a member at multiple wineries, but JCW because of its staff, the grounds, the hospitality, the wine, will always have my heart. Proud member since 2019< /text>

We had an excellent experience at James Cole, thanks to Rachel! This winery is by appointment only, however Rachel was able to squeeze us in for a tasting. To say the wines are fantastic is an understatement. Our host had excellent information on the area, nearby winery’s and their own products. By complete coincidence we found out this winery’s owner is the brother to one of our favourite Okanagan Winery’s - Ex Nihilo. The brothers clearly have a similar passion and an equally attention to detail in their wines. When in Napa be sure to make an appointment and stop in.< /Review>

<Review>By far our favorite vineyard we visited on our entire trip.  I would be happy if this place remained small and hidden which would mean more wine for me.  Nick was an amazing wine guide and made the experience 10x better.  Could not have been any happier with the experience and happy to now be a part of the James Cole family.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>For some reason I thought this was a larger producer, but the cases produced for all their varietals is in the 100's. They do make a range of wines, interestingly.

My wife and I preferred different wines, she liked the Napa cab, and I preferred their "reserve" cab, from one of the nearby mountains (can't remember which off the top of my head). The Napa cab was a bit more tannic, and had some more chalky earth notes.

The ice wine is pricey, but is such a great dessert wine, and I'm a sucker for dessert wines...

Nice walk-in tasting experience, beautiful facility, friendly people.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808501057cc3d49d:0x6b3cc1e09ad745eb< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>This place is great! Scenicly located across from Lomita City Hall. Rotating craft beer selection, decent prices, and the newly added food program are just some of the winning traits of this Lomita local gem! Come on down! Shout out to Ashley for her exemplary customer service!<//review>< pics>

<Review>Chill place to hang out, drink & play pool. Good amount of beer to choose from, so your bound to find something you drink regularly. You can even get daring & try something new.

<Review>My fiancee and I stopped in here for a couple beers while we had some time to kill before our massage appointment down the street and were not disappointed. The beer/cider selection is DEEP, and they have lots of wine too if you're into that sort of thing. We stuck to beers and ciders though, and had a few that were new to us that we thoroughly enjoyed. Service was quick and friendly as well. Good prices too, you won't overpay to try a new beer or two. We'd definitely pop in again if in the area--I recommend this spot!<//Review><Date>1566826866409< /Date><Name>Brett C< /Name>< resp>

<Text>The Lomita Ale House is in excellent place to drink and mingle with new and old friends ..... you can also play pool, video games , darts, and watch sporting events. They often have live entertainment on Saturday nights. The bar has been recently remodelled. I
highly recommend this inviting tavern where if given a chance everyone knows your name and what you drink!<//Text>< pics>

This has quickly become my favorite bar to hang out at and grab a beer. They serve no liquor here. They also have plenty of local brews available which is awesome. Its a very locals only type place and I love that. You don't have a huge crowd there every weekend being loud and obnoxious. They also have daily drink specials as well as pool tables and a back patio area for smoking. Theres parking in the back and front so thats convenient. Bartenders are always super cool and can always recommend a good beer to try out, they'll give you a sample before pouring a full glass. Needless to say this has become my go to bar even though I live about 10 miles away.<//text>

The name says it all. Mini Bar is tiny. So if you're sitting next to a crazy person, you're screwed. There's no place to hide. Except that they now have a parklet because of COVID-19. Long live parklets!< /review>

Great local pet friendly bar. Personally I dont have pets, but if you do this place welcomes them. They ask you keep them on the floor, furniture for humans only.

Service is great. Really enjoyed talking with locals. Great place to meet people for a drink and conversation.</review>

Nice decor and music. The volume is perfect for the setting they have created here.
Unfortunately the drink sucked. I ordered an old fashioned with rye straight. The beverage I received is a very small pour of whiskey and a huge* pour of simple syrup. A real shame from a place that advertises as having good cocktails. As a type one diabetic I rely on classic beverages that everyone prepares the same quality. Unfortunately the Mini Bar couldn’t deliver. You will pay less for a better drink virtually anywhere in this neighborhood.< /review>< Pics>

It seemed like a nice little hole in the wall place, but the bartender wouldn't serve our girlfriends because he disagreed with a political conversation they were having with another customer. Furthermore, instead of just being honest and giving us the true reason he wouldn't serve them, he accused them of being drunk. Pretty lame.<//text>

Mini bar is just that, mini.  This small establishment it a fine place for a drink with great cocktails, jazz playing and some cool art on the walls.  There are some tables up front and a small back room and a arching bar in the middle.  If there are more than about 10 people in the bar it feels kinda crowded.  It is also a challenge to get to the restroom which is precariously places in a tight corner.  Overall though good crowd, good drinks and fun place on Divis.< /review>

It's dark, but not too dark. They play good music which fills the room but isn't too loud. It's a great little bar but tables to spread out onto. Happy hour till 7p is $5 well drinks, $2.50 tecate and if you're lucky they might even give you some chips and Quesa.< /review></record>

What teamwork! Professional and obviously knowledgeable. Emmanuel and Aurora knew what I needed and efficiently worked together like a well oiled machine. I didn’t know they were here until I was cruising google for a good recommendation to go with, and guess what - if I could rate +⭐️, I would give them an extra
+⭐️⭐️⭐️. I’m actually looking forward to paying my car insurance next month!</Review>

This was hands down the BEST insurance experience I have ever had.. I had just purchased a new truck and need "cheap" insurance but I really didn't want to skimp on the coverage, my friend had suggested to go to a "broker" because they give you really cheap rates and I was very skeptical    walking in to Acceptance Insurance but I sat down with Emmanuel and I let him know my situation all the while expecting a ridiculous price, he really went above and beyond with me to explain in detail with me what coverages would fit my budget he even called my bank and gave them the info about my insurance to help them finalize my loan... Witch i didn't even know they would need... Highly recommended Emmanuel at Acceptance is a true PRO. 5 Stars.<//review>

< Review>
Im very happy that I found Maria and Emanuel @ Acceptance Insurance in Woodland. Everytime I cone into the office they are in great moods and easily make me feel welcome and comfortable. I have had a number of issues come up with my automobile situation and without grief or attitudes they happily helped me thru it all. And the main reason I love them and their services is that they saved me hella money by finding what seems to be a great deal! I look forward to coming in and paying me cheap insurance because I know that they will help to put me in a good mood! Thanks guys! Keep up the good work!!< /Review>

This store is normally well stocked. Nice big sock wall towards the back of the store.
Clothing varies from elegant to ostentatious, but not to the level of Zara. Quality of clothing is pretty good. Better than Zara by far.
Plenty of sales always available.</review>

Not only did it take forever to check out, but they also wouldn’t accept my Military ID even though they DID have a discount. Their clothes are to ugly to be over expensive. The only reason I went there to shop was because I needed an item of clothing that they had that I couldn’t find anywhere else.</text>

Great clothing selection, outstanding service from the employees that were hustling to do their jobs while also helping us. 20/10 will be going back. Never a disappointment when walking into Express... online Zara<//review>< time>

(Translated by Google) Friendly staff service but good value for money ..

The women's and men's stores are separate
The calculation is located in the women's store.

The sale price is good.
40% -50% On Sale

(Original)
친절한 직원 서비스도 좋지만 가격대비 품질도 좋네요..

여성과 남성 매장이 분리되어 있고
계산은 여성 매장에 위치하고 있습니다.

세일 가격대가 좋습니다.
40% -50% 세일 중입니다.<//review>

I would recommend this place to anyone considering Lasik the staff is very friendly and the Dr.s walk you through the procedure as its happening. It didn't take more than 15min. And now I have 20/20 vision. I'm very happy with my results and the whole process overall ☺</review>

I had the best experience at this place! From beginning until the end all of the staff were courteous and just so nice! Marisela was thorough with explaining everything I needed to know prior to getting the procedure done, after the procedure, and even my financing options. Dr. Nguyen is like an angel sent from heaven. She is so nice and makes you feel so comfortable. She made sure that all of my questions were answered before deciding on going through with the procedure. On the day of my surgery everything went smoothly. Everyone was encouraging and made me feel less anxious. The surgeons were gentle that I felt very little pain. Miss Beverley was so helpful after the procedure! She made sure that I was transferred in between rooms and handed to my ride safely. I live quite far from this place but I do not mind coming back for future appointments! This place is truly the best!<//text>

<Text>I had the most amazing Lasik experience. The  staff is super friendly and actually takes the time to walk you through the whole procedure in advance and once again during the surgery. I was kinda nervous, but the surgery went pretty smooth. Had 20/20 vision the next morning.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I recently received a vision correction procedure here. Honestly I could not have asked for a better experience. All their staff is incredibly welcoming and friendly. Their doctors are experts and the procedure  went perfectly. I highly recommend coming here if you are interested in getting your vision corrected. I want to specifically point out Ms. Beverly and Ms. Diana for their professionalism, hospitality, and customer service. Also Dr. Nguyen for her expertise and such exceptional care!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Had my surgery done at the Lasik Institute in Ontario, CA. I feel my eyes is worse off now. Called today to be told that they are closed permanently, and my life long guarantee is no longer.

Should have went with my instincts when talking with the dr. He was not knowledgeable, but I went ahead thinking he was not actually doing the surgery:(< /review>

I could always joke around with them and then just really made me comfortable throughout all of the prep work and the procedure.

When I went in for my Lasik consultation they discussed everything with me and the day of my surgery, all staff made my nerves go away and they were so sweet and very accommodating! 2 weeks later and I have much better vision than I ever did and I’m excited for it to get even better!

I can see so very clearly now thanks to this facility and Dr Melikian. The staff is a group of individuals that really truly care about their patients and really took the extra time to answer alllll of my questions. Dr Nguyen was so nice and fun to talk to.
Let’s be real here you want to get better vision but the sound of lasers in your eyes isn’t exactly comforting. Read all of these five star reviews and you will feel comfortable. Schedule your consultation and get ready to be wowed by the awesome staff who will guide you through the entire process. I have never felt so at home in a doctors office before. It was all a very quick, relatively painless procedure.
My eyes were pretty bad and I was not a candidate for traditional Lasik but I was PRK eligible with contoura. First few days were rough but I slept through it. Took a couple weeks off work for recovery time and had it done. Best decision I’ve ever made. Life changing.
I love coming for my follow ups and am so happy I get to leave such positive feedback for the doctors and staff here. They are truly the best!<//review>

My results have been incredible, and I'm so grateful to them for taking the time and care needed to make me comfortable. You can't go wrong by coming to this team! They're A+++ all the way.

<text>When I first came in for my consult a few weeks ago, I felt nervous because I was not sure what to expect. I have to say the place right away looked very professional and I was greeted with bright smiles from Beverly,Jonas, and Ivonne. The doctors were very professional and very informative. They all answered all my questions and made me feel very comfortable with the procedure. Yesterday was my surgery and everyone was very attentive and Beverly checked in on me often making sure I was comfortable and ok. The doctors during the surgery were very attentive as well and walked me though everything that was happening which made me feel more comfortable. Today, I am here for my follow up and I my vision is excellent. Again, I was greeted with bright smiles. I feel fabulous as Beverly said and I recommend this place for anyone considering getting LASIK surgery.<//text>< pictures>

They were really caring from the start and just wanted to help. Getting Lasik was not as bad as I expected. If I had any questions they were there to reinsure me everything will be ok.

The entire staff was so friendly, genuine and honest. They made me feel at ease and answered all of my questions, no matter how silly or odd. The consultation was thorough and they had my best in mind, always.  They were warm and welcoming to my parents who drove me to my surgery appointment. The staff was helpful throughout my procedure day of. They provide an on-call doctor to support you post operation who was kind, thorough and knowledgeable. This is a scary and intimidating procedure to consider and I would go to no one else but this team for all my needs. Outstanding staff,  outstanding team, outstanding experience.  I recommend them to all. I am grateful to them for giving me the most incredible gift- 20/20 vision (the day after!) it’s remarkable and life changing. Thank you.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>The first time I came in the office i was greeted by an amazing staff! They welcomed me into the office as if I had been here for years! I was nervous at first with the prospect of Lasik but soon was put at ease by the amazing Beverly, Ivonne, Diana, Jonas, and Dr. Nguyen. They immediately explained the entire process and reassured me that everything would work out perfectly! I was recommended here by a friend that has had theirs done for 10 years and he still has perfect vision. It been a month and a half post op and I can see 20/15 which is better than 20/20 :). I cannot recommend this place enough, I have been telling all of my friends and coworkers to come here!

Update 12/7/2020

I can’t believe it’s been a year since my surgery. My eyes are still doing so well and I can see 100%. I am so incredibly glad I decided to get LASIK, being able to see all the time without worrying about glasses or contacts has been a life changer for me. If you’re looking for a sign to come to this office and get LASIK here it is.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>There is the worse service ever. They have closed a lot of their offices around California and refuse to provide the promised following-up appointments forcing you pay extra money for a third-party service or drive hundreds of miles to their closest office. If you got an appointment and it was canceled or re-scheduled nobody let you know. Don't waste your time and health working with these people.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The team here is phenomenal! I can't stress enough how professional and knowledgeable this office is. I had my initial surgery years ago and came here for a touch up. Everyone (Dr. Nguyen, Rose, Ivonne, Beverley, Jonas, and Diana) is super and I have already recommended them to my friends and colleagues. Rose especially has been helpful in even taking the time to fix the settings in my phone to fit my new eyes.

I would not hesitate to give them a call and see what amazing things they can do for you! I would not trust anyone else with my eyecare!</review>

< Review>
I received all-laser LASIK at this location about 1.5 years ago and to date I am seeing 20/15.  I cannot speak more highly of Beverly, Jonas, Rose, Ivonne, Diana, and Dr. Melikian.  All aspects of the process from intake to surgery to after-care have been top-notch.  I had previously had a consultation at Nvision Laser Center in Newport Beach prior to finding this place per referral from my co-worker, Jennifer.  At Nvision I felt very much just another number.  At LASIK Vision Institute / Global Laser Vision they made me feel like an old friend and comfortable through the whole process.  I love these folks and owe them a huge debt of gratitude.  Thank your everyone.<//Review>

From the first visit Rose was very nice in explaining the process of all the test that would be done to determine if I was a candidate and Diana explained the cost and payment options in great detailed. Dr Nguyen did all the needed eye test and explained the process of surgery in detail and answered all my questions. The day of surgery Dr Bavand was very nice and calming and explained every step so I knew what to expect. As for the actual surgery it’s very fast and NOT PAINFUL AT All the laser part is only some seconds long. After surgery Beverly was great in after care instructions and making sure I had a safe ride home she’s very sweet. All in all it was a great experience I recommend it to anyone needing it.<//text>< Pics>

I highly recommend  LASIK Vision Institute as your destination if you are planning to get surgery. The staff here are wonderful and very considerate. The atmosphere are friendly and professional. Beverly, Yvonne, Rose, Jonas, Diana, and the doctors all will remember who you are everytime you come back, like you are an old friend. They takes necessary steps to ensure that your surgery will be, safe, successful and that your experience is a great one. I surely will recommend LASIK Vision Institute to anyone who are on the fence and looking for a trustworthy place.< /Text>

What an amazing team at the Huntington Beach office. They explained the surgery process to me for the start and everything was exactly like they said. I’m so happy I no longer have to wear glasses or contacts. Rose and Beverly and the doctors are so warm and amazing. I have completed my visits and I wish I had at least one more so I can see them again.  The surgery 5 stars.  The experience 5 stars.  The staff 5+ stars.< /review>

<text>I was very nervous about the surgery. I knew what to expect since the staff had explained to me all details prior to the appointment, however I was still nervous. The procedure was literally done in "a blink of an eye." The doctors were very professional and made the entire process very comfortable. The staff had such an amazing customer service. The results are just mesmerizing!!! I got 20/20 vision now! I've been wearing glasses for over 22 years and the minute I walked out of my surgery I could see everything! It was one of the most amazing moments of my life.< /text><userid>105326721896445609639<//userid>< rate>

I had such a wonderful experience getting LASIK. I was worried because of my eye anxiety and if I would panic when the surgeon is putting a laser in my eyeballs. But it wasn’t that bad. They gave me drugs to relax me and everyone was so friendly and accommodating. I now have 20/20 vision!</review>

<Review>The staff here are amazing. I have worked with Dr Nguyen, Rose, Ivonne and I’m missing other that have superior customer service and made the whole process easy.

I was nervous to have Lasik done and now that I have and my eye sight is better than ever with NO glasses! I can’t praise enough for others to have this done. The process was painless! The procedure wasn’t anything I would have though with the colors while the complete the surgery. I won’t lie that night was very uncomfortable for me as Tylenol pm does not work for me in particular but I can’t complain it was surgery and being uncomfortable is always part of a surgery but.... the next day not having to put glasses in to see was wonderful!!!

I had an issue with dry eye as I work in a computer all day and when I called they got me in the same day! And the solution..... use the eye drops more often. And start taking fish oil ( I’ll admit I’m not a fan taking fish oil with the possibility of it coming back up but WOW it makes such a big difference!) so get this done and take fish oil tablets and you won’t regret it!< /Review>< Date>

I came in for glasses and was hugely disappointed after 2 tries to get my progressives correct. Neither prescription was good once they put it into eye glass form. I had to settle for the one that was best for distance for driving. But I am so unhappy with how they do glasses. I do not have a difficult prescription and have always had good glasses over the years. I was told to get cheap reading glasses by the staff to help with my close up readings. I should not have to do that. I now have to wait a total of two years before my insurance will pay for another pair. The glasses leave me dizzy and foggy and my eyes very tired. Wherever they send out their glasses to doesn't do good work. The "blend" on the glasses is very distorted after three tries to get it correct. The only reason they have 2 stars is the staff was nice, tried to be helpful, and polite.<//text>

I felt comfortable going into surgery thanks to the reassurance and positive comments from all the staff here! I had PRK done right before Thanksgiving, and although it was a painful and lengthy recovery time, I'm very close to 20/20 vision now, and I'm so happy!! I definitely recommend anyone to come here for a consultation! You'll be happy you did and happier with the wonderful results!!

<review>The staff has been very helpful from the beginning. Always welcoming me when I walk in, they have answered any and all questions that I had. On the day of my procedure they were helpful and comforting. They thoroughly explained the process and what to expect. When it came time for the procedure, it was quick and painless. I came in the next day for a follow up and could see no problem. Would definitely recommend both this location and procedure for anyone thinking about Lasik. My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner.</review>< Pics>

Rose the nurse, Diana in finance and Dr. Nguyen just beautiful. Wish I can come back with more visits but because they operation was so successful that I can only come back as needed. They rocks!<//Review>

They have been nothing but kind and helpful throughout my experience there. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is going to get lasik or is planning to get lasik. Great place to learn more information about your condition. Surgeons are super professional and kind will definitely recommend this place to my peers in the future.< /Text>

I just had my follow up visit after having Lasik yesterday at the Huntington Beach office and I'm seeing 20/15 today! The entire staff was great. They answered all of my questions and explained everything very thoroughly. My only regret was not finding this group sooner!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>The lasik vision institute at Huntington Beach is a wonderful facility. I’ve have nothing but positive experience here. The only regret I have is not having the surgery sooner this summer. I had my procedure at the end of July and I’m so glad to not be dependent on my glasses. I’ll come back for an update in 3 months once my vision is stabilized.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The staff at the Huntington Beach location are very patient, friendly,  informative, and great hospitality. When I came in last week for my consultation, I was a bit nervous and did not know what to expect. The doctors and staff answered every one of my questions and in a way made me feel comfortable and confident in getting the lasik surgery done. Its been a day since I got the lasik and I am happy to say I can see perfectly fine without my glasses!  Super grateful for the Huntington Beach Lasik Institution team! If you have been thinking about getting lasik, I highly recommend getting it done!</review>

< review>
One of the super best experiences I have ever had with an office staff and their Dr’s.  I went in not being able to see without my glasses and not seeing very well with my glasses anymore. When I walked in the first time I was welcomed with great energy. Everyone was super nice and friendly and they walked me through the process each time to make sure I was comfortable. They checked on me regularly and always gave me reminder calls which I love. The day I had my surgery Rose even said she would hold my hand during surgery if I needed it. Knowing she was there helped me stay calm.  Beverly wrapped me up after surgery and even helped walk me to my car to make sure I was all buckled up and told my husband to take care of me and to call her if we needed anything. Check up after surgery Rose, Beverly and the other staff memeber’s cheered me on my awesome progress. I was already able to see without needing glasses and able to see small text that I was not able to previously see at all. Thank you team so much for your hard work, your communication and your commitment to making sure my expectations and experience was 100%. I am sooooo happy I could cry. Thank you just isn’t good enough for the treatment I received.<//review>

Great staff, great experience.  I have worn contact lenses for nearly 30 years. Recently they really started to bug me.   I figured the time was right to get my eyes done.  Really happy I did this.  No more messing around with contacts and solution.<//review>

I just had My Lasik surgery yesterday and when I woke this Morning, it was like seeing the world again for the very first time. Being able to have my vision corrected was the Best Decision I ever made. But choosing The LASIK Vision Institute®️ was my Greatest decision. The Staff is Amazing. I never felt more comfortable. Only thing I regret is not going to them sooner. - Louis P.< /Review>

Had the best experience here at the Lasik institute. Jonas and Beverly were the best people you can ask for to take care of you during your pre and post op procedure. They are very caring and the nicest people you can ask for. The procedure went great and all of the staff was a joy to meet. I would recommend coming here if you are considering getting your Lasik done.< /text>

They are very helpful with explaining the process and with the procedure itself. Dr. Bavand was my surgeon that did my eyes. It was very quick, he explained things very well and he made sure that I am comfortable while the surgery is going on. Dr. Nguyen was the one who checked my eyes pre op and post-op she was very patient with me, explained the procedure and she made sure that my eyes was healing very well. Beverly and Rose were the nurses that helped me and accommodated me through my surgery day and post-op appointments, they are both very helpful and very caring to the patients plus they are really happy for me and my eyes :) And last, Diana was the one who helped us with financial matters. She was very patient with us explaining the financial plans and she gave us a good amount of discount. Over all I recommend this hospital 100%! I will forever treasure my experience with them! And I for sure will continue to recommend them to my friends, family etc.</text>< pictures>

They have 5 stars for a reason! They make you feel like 5 stars when you are there. It’s been such a awesome experience. The procedure was a complete success, so professional but what made it so awesome was the staff. They are incredibly positive and fun. There is a vibe in there amongst the staff. A professional and fun atmosphere. They leave me with a smile on my face each time. Jonas is such a awesome person, very kind. Beverly is halarious. Rose makes you feel so welcomed. Itzel is a hoot! I can’t say enough good things.

Come here for your Lasik. No regrets< /review>

<Review>I would highly recommend this treatment for anyone sick and tired of wearing glasses. I gradually moved from 1.25 readers up to 2.50. When those started getting sketchy, I decided to do something.
Now my vision is like a technicolor movie in ultra high definition. No more worrying about where I put my glasses or buying new ones to replace all the pairs that got broken or lost.
Do it! You'll be glad you did.<//Review></record>

<Text>My experience went very well. Both my husband and I had our surgeries here. We researched other facilities throughly and felt Huntington Beach Lasik was the best choice in Orange County. They provided us with great customer service, and the surgeon was very comforting during the operation. It really isn’t as scary as you think it is. If you plan on purchasing the groupon, I’d recommend doing the free consultation first.</Text>< pictures>

They have 5 stars for a reason! They make you feel like 5 stars when you are there. It’s been such a awesome experience. The procedure was a complete success, so professional but what made it so awesome was the staff. They are incredibly positive and fun. There is a vibe in there amongst the staff. A professional and fun atmosphere. They leave me with a smile on my face each time. Jonas is such a awesome person, very kind. Beverly is halarious. Rose makes you feel so welcomed. Itzel is a hoot! I can’t say enough good things.

Come here for your Lasik. No regrets</text>

<text>Everyone was very friendly, they honored the same discount that my friend who referred me had received. I had LASIK done in October the process was easy and fast recovery was fast on a mom to two little ones so a fast recovery time was a must. Although my vision is still a tad blurry because I have dry eyes the drs are very nice and have been keeping a close eye on me and sharing tips on how to help my eyes. I would highly recommend this place to everyone! Also, all of my follow up appointments since the surgery have been free so they can keep track of my eye sight.</text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

Had PRK surgery and have been attending checkups here since February 2018. Dr. Arbi Melikian was highly recommended by my regular optometrist. My eyes have adjusted well and everyone has been extremely helpful. Beverly and Rose are super friendly and make me feel so welcome.< /Review>

From the start when I came to my first appointment to see if I was a good candidate for lasik Ivonne & Jonas were super nice & extremely helpful. They were always answering my questions as they were  prepping me to see Dr. Nguyen. Dr. Nguyen was very comforting and patience with me, she examined my eyes and come to a conclusion that I was a great candidate for lasik. Then came Diana to explain the payment info and she was super sweet! And so yesterday I did my surgery and thanks to Dr. Bavand & Dr. Melikian I can see without my glasses!!! Today I can see so much better than I did yesterday 😊
Thank you Ivonne, Jonas, Diana, Rose, Beverly, Dr. Nguyen, Dr. Melikian & Dr. Bavand!<//text>

Just had Lasik completed by Dr. Bawand and would like to thank him for his kindness and amazing skills. You are blessed! I can see 20/20 vision now. I also would like to thank his staff at Lasik Vision Institute,  Beverly, Rose, Jason, Diana, Dr. Nguyen, Dr. Melikias to name a few. The staff  are professional, kind, and answered all my questions appropriately.  I can't believe how pain free this procedure was and the following day I was back to reading without glasses.  I highly recommend Dr.Bawand, Dr. Melikias, and Dr. Nguyen for optimal work.< /review>

I'm 35 years old and finally decided to make the call to Lasik Vision Institute after hearing how good lasik has been to people I work with. When I went in for my consult in Huntington Beach, Dr. Nguyen treated me very nicely and provided me with all the options and details I needed to make my informed decision. The only part was my concern on the cost and how I would be paying for it. Diana helped me with the financing. She made it very simple for me and set me up with zero interest via Care Credit. So, I had my lasik surgery on July 19. It was way better than what I thought it was going to be. Dr. Bavand made me feel comfortable and I did not feel a thing ( they provided plenty of numbing medication and sedative). Dr. Bavand let me know what he was doing every step of the way. I felt like I was under his surgical care in less than 10 minutes. I have had two follow up appointments and Rose checks me in and gets me ready to see Dr. Nguyen. Rose and Dr. Nguyen make it a pleasant visit answering all my questions and addressing what post follow up care I need to pay closer attention to. This office is very professional and clean. I remember reading how dry the eyes feel after having this surgery. I experienced super dry eyes the first couple of weeks along with light sensitivity during the day, and glare at night. I would use the drops as instructed, all day, and also would wear the dark eye shades( sunglasses) they provided me throughout the day, even at work on the computer. Now that I am 2 months post surgery, I use the drops 4-6 times a day, and wear my sunglasses when driving. I have no issues with glare at night. The eye drops they recommended are those daily use vials that I bought at Costco. They feel soo good. keep your eyes moist! Lots of Omega-3 people! If you are thinking about Lasik, I say go for it! Better now, than later. You can finance and make a monthly payment. Or put a couple of hundred down, and drop your payment. My surgery was just under $3600 for what my eyes needed. Everyone is different. Your consult should help determine what is right for you. Go online, you can see when they have special discounts. I also have VSP insurance which is who recommended me to these guys. Worth every penny!!!</text>

I was extremely nervous to get this done and have been wanting to for years but the thought of surgery on my eyes was extremely frightful! The staff and doctor were so accommodating and helped put me at ease. It turned out my worries were for nothing. The surgery was quick and painless and I was able to see, albeit a blurry the first day, but next couple of days my sight was clear! It’s life changing to not have to wear glasses or contacts and have perfect vision. I was a -7.5 nearsighted, so normally I could not see clear more than 8 inches from my face! Truly greatfull for the office staff and everyone at this office.<//review>< pictures>

I actually came in for an interview. I have worked for other LASIK medical offices. What got my attention was how professional the staff where. The office was extremely clean. I observed patients counselors working with perspective patients. I got the feeling that the level of care was vital to GLV.  Your visit is care is timely and methodical. They care very much about each person. I highly recommend GLV to all who want the best in vision correction.< /Text>

Disclaimer: I had my surgery Oct. 2017.

I remember everything as it happened yesterday! I wanted to get the Lasik done for such a long time, but looking for the right Dr. To perform the procedure took me a long time to find. I seriously had  so many consultations with Doctors all over southern California but none ever felt right. It wasn't until I had my first consultation with Dr. Melikian and his amazing team! ( Dr. Nguyen , Beverly, Jonas and Rose) that I fell in love with the place and I knew I wanted to have my surgery with them. When I met with the doctor for the first time, I had a list of questions I asked every doctor I would meet, and Dr. Melik was super patient with me and my mom; answer; he every single question and  concern we had, was throughout and above all, he had the best attitude, bedside manners and he was just super super nice. The whole team was and has always been extremely nice and welcoming, which is something that almost never happens at  doctors offices.

The procedure
If you have been doing your research, you will know the procedure itself is very quick ( I recommend watching YouTube videos). On the day of the surgery they ask you to come dress comfortably, which I did, because after the procedure they are going to prescribe you a sedative(if I'm not mistaken) that will help with any pain and will help you sleep it off until the next day).  So you come in in the morning, they are going to make you watch a video of what's going to happen and what to expect after. The team will give you a care packet with eye wear you must wear for some good two weeks post lasik (to not accidentally rub your eyes when you sleep). A fter all the videos and explanations, I was super excited to start and to be honest I was not scared or nervous at all! but they will offer you and recommend you to take a relaxer pill. Which I did but I kinda regret taking because it obviously makes you Druggy and relaxed, but I just hate feeling of dizziness so this is a personal choice.
The procedure seriously lasts like 5 seconds each eye approximately. It's ridiculously short! It made me regret all the years it took me to made up my mind to get the surgery done. I walked in with blurry vision, and 5 minutes later I walked out ...well still with watery blurry vision but it was much better than before xD. I then walked out all happy and excited, took the medication to knock me out for the day and I slept the day away until the next morning.
I did not feel any pain at all, I don't know if that's usual but I had no pain , no headache and my eyes looked great! There was no sign that I had just had lasik done. I could see crystal clear! For the first time since I was 11 years old, I did not have to reach out to grab my glasses first thing when I woke up in the morning. It was so amazing, having HD vision, see signs that were fAr away ! It is seriously a life changing decision. I have no regrets up to this day! My eyes did end up being dry and I do have to use eye drops multiple times a day. If I stay too long without eye drops, I do get pretty bad headache. They say that normally it does away with time, but I just happen to have the bad luck that it has not. The doctor gives you alternatives, like eye plugs, which definitely help SOOOOO much! Look them up, they are very handy. It is really hard to live with dry eyes, but at the same time having great vision is so amazing and for me kinda worth the dryness.
Up to this date, I still visit Dr. Nguyen and Dr.Melik for follow ups to make sure my eyes health is still goodand Make sure my sight is clear and amazing. I am still really happy with the results, even though my eyes are really dry.< /Text>

< Review>
I have worn glasses and or contacts for close to 20 years. I was finally done with all that and I decided to get Lasik. Not only was The Lasik Vision Institute in HB highly recommend and they accepted my insurance. On my initial appointment Rose and Dr. Nguyen were the nicest and most helpful. They answered all my questions and took great care in making sure I was comfortable. On the day of my procedure Itzel and Diana kept the professionalism and care going. I don't remember the name of the Doctors that performed the procedure but they were very clear with what I was expected to go through and helped me stay calm during the uncomfortable parts. The procedure was quick and painless and Jonas helped me after until my ride home arrived.

The following day during my follow-up appointment everyone genuinely happy that I was excited and happy with my results. Blurry vision for 20 years and after one 10min procedure I'm 20/20 and I might get better as I heal. I can't say enough good things about everyone here. I will recommend anyone I know looking to get Lasik to come here< /Review>

I was very nervous going into it, from the beginning. I found a Groupon for Lasik Institute and went for it.  From day one with my consultation the staff was very friendly and did not try to push anything on me.  They were very patient and answered any questions that I had. Even when I would call them randomly throughout the day. I am very happy with the over all service and procedure and service.  I would  Recommend to anyone who is thinking about lasik institute. It is the best decision I have made.</text>

I had been wanting to get lasik and get rid of my glasses for years and on April 16th I finally went for it. I was nervous at first, of course, but the staff is so informative and friendly that everything was so comfortable. I came for a candidacy check up first and scheduled my surgery promptly after. The day of the surgery I was given Valium to relax and numbing eye drops, then waited for the doctor. It literally took 10 seconds of lasering per eye and a good night sleep to change everything. Beverly walked me to my car where my ride was waiting because he thought it was going to take longer. The next day I came to my post-op appointment and I already had 20/20 vision and only minor discomfort due to dryness, which can be easily solved by following the doctors orders and using your drops. Today was my second week follow up and my eyes feel great and see perfect. Best decision I made for myself! Thanks HB family for being so professional and sweet!</Review>

The LASIK Vision Institute/Global Laser Vision is amazing!! It will be 1 year on April 6, 2018 that I had my LASIK surgery. Not only was my surgery a success, but my pre and post surgery was wonderful! The physicians & staff made me feel so comfortable through the whole process. The facility is very clean and everyone is extremely caring and so nice. If I ever have any questions or concerns, my answers are addressed immediately. I would highly recommend The LASIK Vision Institute/Global Laser Vision. I am so happy and thankful for everyone here!!!</Review>

<Review>The LASIK Vision Institute has given me one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff here is amazing. Everyone at the front desk and each assistant (Beverley, Itzel, Jonas, and Rosary) were incredibly friendly and approachable. Diana guided me throughout the entire process, keeping me informed and gave easy and clear instructions before and after my procedure as well as Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Melilzian (I hope I spelled that correctly). I hope I didn't miss anyone else who helped me throughout this process because I can't thank everyone enough for everything they've done. This was the best decision I have ever made and I would HIGHLY recommend anyone give The LASIK Vision Institute a chance if you have ever considered LASIK.< /Review>< Time>

From the very beginning I was concerned about having somebody work on my eyes with fear that something might go wrong. I went to several websites to look at reviews for the local Lasik clinics in the area and decided to move forward with The LASIK Vision Institute of Huntington Beach.

From the beginning to the day after surgery the whole experience with The LASIK Vision Institute of Huntington Beach has been great

The staff has been wonderful to work with and very professional.

In the beginning the consultation they gave me included a full eye exam to make sure that I was a good candidate for the procedure.  I was fitted with some contact lenses for the suggested Lasik procedure prescription.  I wore them for a few days to make sure that I was comfortable with the vision before moving forward. In my case i wanted them to fit me several times but once I was happy with what my vision would be they then scheduled the appointment to have the procedure completed (i was never rushed or pressured into making a decision).

The day of the procedure they have you come in to review the procedure and what to expect afterwards. They gave me a valium to calm me down.  The procedure itself took only a few minutes per eye.  There was no discomfort at all during the procedure.

Afterwards they gave me some Tylenol PM so that you could sleep through most of the discomfort expected afterwards. I woke up the next morning and things were a little  foggy but other than that everything was great (eyes were a little dry). I was able to drive myself to my follow-up appointment that morning.   The waiting room had several patients there that had driven themselves to their follow up appointment.  They have me setup for several follow up appointments for this coming year to make sure that everything continues to be a positive experience.

It couldn't have been any easier.

Thank you very much to the staff at The LASIK Vision Institute of Huntington Beach (I would mention names but I would be concerned that I left someone out).< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5<//rating></record>

<review>I got PRK last year (exactly a year ago), and I am so glad I did! I've been able to enjoy the super bloom this spring, and also not have to keep on buying glasses every time my boyfriend sits on them!

The process was easy. My mom previously got her lasik here several years ago, and my dad also came to this office for lasik many many years ago. So I knew i wanted to come to this office for my eyes! My mom decided to gift me the gift of vision as my graduation present. So i made an appointment for a consultation, and a few weeks later, I came in and got the PRK done! During the surgery, the doctors are really good with keeping you relaxed and calm, and talk you through the WHOLE process every step of the way.  Healing time took awhile. Within two weeks, i was able to see clearer but it took about two months for my eyes to adjust completely. So if you're thinking about getting PRK, make sure you're able to get someone to take care of you for awhile (like driving) so you wont have to deal with being blind.  They also offer regular checkups to make sure your eyes are healing fine after the surgery.

The staff here are amazing! Evelyn and Jonas in the front are very helpful and always accommodating. Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Melikian are so nice and knowledgeable. Awesome office!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I’ve been considering LASIK for the last 10 years and never had the courage to do it. The LASIK Insitute at the Huntington Beach CA location made me feel so comfortable with moving forward in the decision to get LASIK. The staff are all incredibly friendly and there was hardly any wait times. After my 7 minute procedure, I woke up the next morning with 20/15 vision! I havent had any issues with side effects or major dry eyes. I’m so happy I finally got this done. I just wish I had done it years ago!<//Text>< user_name>

<text>Getting lasik is one of the best things I have ever done for myself! Especially choosing The The Lasik Vision Institute  to perform this gift of clear sight was the topper. I researched many places and came to choose The Lasik Vision Institute. From the very start, everyone was very accommodating and helpful. All of my questions were answered, even though I had many  and at length! I could call anytime with follow-up questions. Everything with my experience and my results went exactly as I was informed and I followed every instruction by the book. The results were amazing and continue to be! I still remember waking up the day after my surgery with clarity of sight that I never imagined was possible!
I look forward to continuing my regular check-up care here as I have grown to know the staff and even though I may be around only every year, they don't miss a beat in recalling exactly how I was doing and what I was up to last time I was in. It is truly a friendly/family-like atmosphere. There is not 1 thing extra I want for, The Lasik Vision Institute has it all!

In closing a big THANK YOU to the staff:
Diana - You were my first encounter/impression from day 1 when I walked in for my original consult. From that point on through, thanks for answering all of my questions and being so helpful and detailed with explanation of the procedure and finance when we got going. It is so much off of a patient's mind when we know we can move forward with confidence, peace-of-mind, and the comfortable feeling of knowing how approachable you are to resolving any questions big or small.
Dr. Melikian - You always have me in stitches - from laughing (not the bad kind) lol. Your sense of humor is off the charts! Thank you for also being so informative and descript on what I could expect from the procedure every step of the way for surgery and recovery. Your presence, expertise, and extremely helpful and caring approach, peppered with your amazing sense of humor totally "amputated" any nervousness I had lol "nervousness-ectomy." :-)
Dr. Nguyen -  I so much enjoy chatting with you in the course of follow-up visits. Your smile is so infectious, I can't help but leave with a smile on my face. Always so intuitive, thank you for always asking the right follow-up questions and keeping me honest with my follow-up care. You happen to answer questions I may have forgotten I wanted to ask, or questions that I was about to ask every time. I hope all is well and I am very much looking forward to touching base with you in next month's follow-up.
Beverly -  It is always a pleasure to come in for follow-ups and catch up with you first thing during the initial part of follow-up's. Your ability to recall what I was up to around my previous visit is remarkable. Coming in for follow-ups and seeing you is akin to visiting a long-time friend. I always look forward to coming back in to catch up with you.< /text>< pics>

<text>I love this place!!

Before deciding to get LASIK here I went to 2 other places and did a lot of research. My friend recommended me Global eye and Laser center because she was so happy with her LASIK surgery results!!! And I was not disappointed!!

The staff was amazing from Jonas, Diana and Itzel in the front desk and exam room, to Dr. Nyung who checked my eyes before and after surgery and Dr. Melikian was just so kind and careful during surgery!! They altogether are AWESOME!!

I usually get super anxious before any procedure but they provided me Valium and it helped a lot through the procedure, although I was a little bit drowsy everyone was super helpful and kind to me while I was on drugs lol and also off drugs... they were just AMAZING all Along!!!

After the surgery I had to come in the next day for a follow-up appointment and my eye was feeling a little bit uncomfortable. Together Dr. Nyung and Dr. Melikian looked at me and decided to put in a contact lens to make me more comfortable.... and it made me feel extremely comfortable.... (they took it out later during the week) I've been healing really good!

I can't stress how gentle and kind they were at this office!! I felt safe and In good professional hands at all Time. They were also very considered with my finances :) they even gave me coupons to save on my prescriptions and I saved almost $80! Lol

But the most important thing is..... I CAN SEE WITHOUT GLASSES!! 20/20 YAY!!!

Thank you so so much!!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

I bought a Cal King mattress from Mancini's in 2018, and had a great experience.  The team helped me understand the differences between various brands, styles, and price points, and then delivered the mattress quickly with a great installation / set up experence.  Then, in 2021, I had an issue with a separate bed and I called Mancini's for help.  Ryan and Sunny both got on the phone with me to help and offered great suggestions to resolve the issue.  I will definitely return to Mancini's for my next mattress purchase - the Dublin location has a great team.< /review>

Even though I had bought a mattress about 4 years ago I knew what I had bought was starting to bother my back. I talked to Ryan Romero and he was so patient with me. He didn’t push me to get any kind of bed but I knew what I wanted when I laid on it. He was knowledgeable, brought up things I might not have thought about when buying a mattress. He knew his stuff. He really wanted to find exactly what I needed. He was the best and I’d recommend him to anyone who needs to shop for a bed. I do like that Mancinis isn’t a big box store or franchise. It makes all the difference. Thank you Ryan Romero for a great experience.< /review></record>

I just like to give a big shout out to Ryan Romero at Dublin Mancini’s Sleepworld. He was so professional and so knowledgeable with their products and features and he was very pleasant and funny to do business with. It’s been about 15 years since me and my wife bought a new mattress and the first thing Ryan had us do was answer his brief questions about our sleep habits and pains we might have.Then he had us lay on this bed that retrieve the logistics to find a mattress that is  blended for both me and my wife. It was pretty cool and high-tech. Once he had all the options of different mattresses that were compatible for us we went to check them all out. Found the best one, worked out a deal, got an interest free deal on the billing and walked out happy customers. Thanks Ryan, your expertise and experience in this field made it enjoyable experience for us. We know exactly where we will go in the future when shopping for a new mattress.</Text>

We arrived at Mancini's 30 minutes before closing on a Wednesday. Ryan took the time to show us a variety of mattresses. We always shop around but find the big selection and great service sets this company apart. Today my mattress was delivered on schedule.
With all the different mattress technologies on the market today it was very valuable to try them out in person and speak with a real pro like Ryan. Keep up the good work!<//Review>

We came in on a Sunday afternoon after spending Saturday hanging with friends. That is to say we were tired and not really planning on buying a bed. Sorosh took serious care with us and showed us exactly the kind of stuff we wanted to see. He didn't pressure or rush us at all, and was super patient. We eventually bought a really nice mattress that came in right under budget for us. Thanks 9< /review>

<Text>There are a ton of mattress stores, but the customer service here is unparalleled. Suni was a joy to work with - patient, knowledgeable, and not pushy. So often in sales, the bells and whistles become the heart of the matter - not in this case, because I articulated my needs and they were heard.
They carry a great selection and will move mountains to do right by the customer.
Start here. It will likely be your last stop.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Ryan at  Mancini’s in Dublin was fantastic. We we’re looking at other mattress competitors to make a purchase, but, after talking with Ryan, we made our mind up. We bought our new bed from Mancini’s! He was very kind and helpful with plenty of knowledge in his field. I would definitely make another purchase from Ryan at Mancini’s in Dublin.</Review>

<text>Suni was amazing. Very kind and patient, and had a good plan for testing beds: she asks how you usually sleep, and recommends a firmness to start with. Then she has you try the other two kinds of firmnesses to see how they are, and then back to the first one to calibrate yourself. Then once you know what firmness works best for you, you proceed to try other brands and find out which brand is best for yourself. Definitely would recommend going here if you need a mattress!< /text>< pictures>

Ryan romero helped me and my boyfriend buy our first bed together. Ryan was very patient as I have never bought a bed and had no idea what I was looking for. I was like little red riding hood, "this ones too firm, this ones too soft" until ryan found my perfect match that's "just right!" We even decided to get a adjustable foundation to go with our new mattress. Very happy with our purchase!!!! Thanks for the great help and your patience ryan!!</Review>

My dad is moving into a care facility on a tight budget.  We had already been to three places and the salespeople were
always trying to explain to us why we needed to spend more money,So we left and
met Craig , we told him our needs he quickly understood what we wanted and
we purchased the Mancini brand at our exact budget,,and gave us some sheets and pillows at no cost,, Thank you Mr Mancini for hiring the type of
person who listens to your customers and has some integrity we will return when my wife and I are ready for our own needs,,
Sincerely Ed<//text>

< Review>
We were in need of a new bed and rather than buy online, (a place I usually go for many items) we actually wanted to touch and feel and try what was available in the sleep arena.  We could not be more pleased with our experience at Mancini's Sleep World in Dublin and cannot recommend this store highly enough.  Our salesman, John, greeted us politely when we entered and then asked us a few questions in order to save us time and point us toward the beds that would best suite our needs.  The selection was immense and as we were putting down a large amount of money on a bed, we were so happy to have been able to touch, feel, and lie on the beds and experience their features, giving us a bit more security in our decisions.  (An added bonus is the four month "sample" period the store affords, really helping you feel secure in your purchase.) After a great deal of sampling, not for lack of comfort, just simply because we wanted to be sure, we finally chose a bed.  Throughout the process, John was always available to answer our questions, yet he also gave us the alone time to we needed to enjoy the beds so we never felt pressured.  The entire process was so easy and actually enjoyable.  Our new bed will be delivered and set up tomorrow, truly an easy, seamless process with a great guarantee!!  I cannot imagine that I had contemplated purchasing a bed online, after the ease of shopping at Mancini's, I now realize what a mistake that would have been.  Thank you John and Mancini's for a better nights rest!!< /Review>

<review>We went in on a Sunday afternoon and was approached by Suni. She was terrific! Unlike other stores where people breathe down your neck trying to make a sale, she would let us know the info and then step away to give us time to think and consult. We got our hybrid sealy mattress that day, it was delivered and set up later that afternoon and had a great nights rest that evening. They have an awesome team over at Dublin Mancini.<//review><GmapID>0x808fec6e57d7062b:0x384549aee1030d99</GmapID><userid>110638951285737377520< /userid>< username>

Went to Mancini ‘s about 1 month ago in search of a new bed, as ours was giving up the ghost. James came over to us and had us sitting and laying on 6 or so different beds and within 10 minutes helped us identify what we wanted (always a pain for me). James also gave us a good sale price and more. Happily sleeping well on our new bed now. Thanks, James!</Review>

Excellent customer service.  I walked in just to get an idea of prices and I left purchasing a brand new King.  Buying a bed couldn't get any easier.  James was really knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.  Highly recommend buying from the Dublin Mancini's.< /Review>

Great place for a bed, bedroom furniture, and quick delivery.  Not high pressure sales pitch, family owned, and was happy to make a purchase from them. Large selection of beds and staff is very knowledgeable about the brands, options, and which beds best suit your needs.<//Text>

We went to the Dublin store today and considered ordering an Aireloom set but couldn’t initially fathom paying that much for a bed. However, the lady in store named Rhonda did an excellent job explaining the long term benefits which made the cost worthwhile.

We appreciated her knowledge and her courteous demeanor even after we decided to shop other stores only to return to buy from her.</review>

I bought my mattresses during the memorial day weekend here. I love my bed, and it was an awesome experience working with Suni, and she gave us a good deal for mattresses including the bed frame.
I highly recommend this place for mattresses shopping</Review>

<Review>Was greeted by the store manager, Suni Nutakki.  She is a wonderful person and really knows mattresses.  All the pluses and minuses.  My situation was very special since it was for my wife.  I am the care giver.  I wanted an adjustable bed and a soft mattress.  After laying down on many of them I ended up liking the Tempur-Pedic the best with their adjustable base.  That afternoon I brought in my wife to test them out with me.  I could tell as soon as I got her onto the Tempur-Pedic it was the one.  I said this is it, Suni wrote us up, and then the next morning there were the delivery guys.  3 nights later now and my wife is sleeping like a baby, the whole night through.  Thank you Suni!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I see several old reviews and I can say the crew there now is not like that. John has been fantastic, not pushy, exceedingly patient and as a family this is the third bed purchase this year. Not only has he been great with pricing, his attitude and customer service ROCKS! Sorry to say I think we are set for another 10 years.</text>

Best experience ever!! Suni & James were simply amazing.  They were able to help me find the perfect bed for my son & still keep within my budget. There was never any of that hard sales pressure you run into so often.  Not only that, but this was only my 2nd time to the store and they remembered who I was. You can't get any more friendly and personable than that if you ask me.  From now on this is my go to store for all our bedding needs.  I would definitely recommend Mancini's to my friends!  Thanks guys for everything!!<//Text>

My friend Stephen M purchased an RV that day and needed a mattress that night. We called Mancini's to make sure they were going to be open by the time we could get there, and they were.  We arrived around 8:30 pm and John was ready for us. He showed us our options and proceeded to work with Stephen to make sure he not only got what he needed, but also that he left as a satisfied customer.  John went above and beyond to make sure that happen, and it did!!!
Thank you again John!  Mancini's is fortunate to have you!!

I was a returning customer about to purchase a third bed set, bed, mattress, dresser, until the rep Robert made the experience the worst I have ever had, more so than a car salesperson.

He was pushy to begin with as I recall from 2011, but today was worse. He kept pushing and pushing to close the deal. "Pull the trigger" "Be a man" "it is only $299" "I have a family to feed" language...it was pretty bad. He was going to throw in bean bags, which I didn't need.

Finally he said he would cover my tax, but I had to do it NOW. I asked if I could call him later on or return and he said sure, but it will be 1297 + TAX. I went to the counter and he said is this the right number and address to put the order through. I told him this bed wasn't what my kids wanted, so maybe I could come back in 30 mins or an hour. He said sure, but it would be $1400+. ($1297 + TAX) To end it off, I asked "what difference does it make if I get it now or in 30 or 1 hour?" He said something like "I don't need to do this and have a great day." I turned and left the store and report this behavior to their corporate office.

Keep in mind there was no one else in the store and it was around 12:20pm, not sure why he didn't want to help a returning customer and possibly make a deal.<//text>

<Review>Typical high pressure sales tactics, but friendly. And if you play the negotiation game right, there are nice discounts to be had. Prices tend to be more competitive than Sleep Train, but not quite as good as online.<//Review>< rate>

My fiancé and I went shopping for a mattress Memorial Day weekend. Chris Berry helped us find our perfect mattress. He was knowledgeable and very patient. We came in multiple days (since this was a big purchase for us) and he address all of our questions and concerns. We had many options when buying a mattress, but we chose here because we got a great value and Chris is an excellent sales man. It was such a pleaureable experience that my parents decided to buy a mattress that same day from Chris as well. We look forward to doing business with Mancini's and Chris in the future.< /text>

I was very unhappy with the service I received from this store. The manager I talked to was Rob. I was recommended to speak to the lady manager there, but she was not there when I went in. I tested out several mattresses, and found one that I liked. I was told about their 120 day exchange policy on the mattress, free delivery, 15 yr mattress guarantee, etc. I was then informed that the particular floor model I was looking at was going to be sold and that I could buy it at a considerable cost reduction from the new one. So I went for it. As we were ringing it up, I was then told there was no financing on the floor models. Ok, no problem, pay cash. After the sale was completed, he shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and said "Just so you know, there is no exchange and no warranty on the floor models." The sale was final. I wouldnt have purchased the mattress if I had known I wasnt going to get the perks that come with buying a new mattress. Manufacturers sell their products to many sales locations, people make customers come to their store. I hope no one ever goes to this store for their own good.</text>

I decided to try the adjustable frame and a nice comfy mattress. Suni showed me three different mattress knowing I was on a budget. I found the perfect fit. Suni gave me a good deal. Why  do I keep coming  back to this dublin store, because Suni is real and honest.

She did not take me to the expensive beds first, she took me to what I could afford. Never tried to pressure me to buy an expensive bed like most places do. She worked with me to find the best mattress on my budget.  I want to also thank John for going out of his way to make sure I got my adjustable frame sooner. My bed arrives tonight and I can't wait. Thank you Suni for helping me find my dream bed without breaking my budget.  It was not about making a sale but helping someone sleep good.  Thank you..<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Not a lot of business about now. Just a few people within the mall. Lots of stuff on sale, though. So, it might be wise to go and browse for deals. Got this beautiful ring for less than $20 from JC Penny.</Text>< Pictures>

I missed coming to this mall. I grew up coming to this mall hanging out when Mervyn's was here. I bought my 1st puff jacket from here. I remember when chick fillet use to have people standing out giving samples. As a young one that was awesome. A I walked around it brought back so many wonderful memories. I'd rather drive back here to shop every time I have a need. Roseville Galleria's build a bear Solano. 🤭 I think you can already tell which one I would pick cause I said so already.</Text>

ZAZA TOYS LOCATED IN SOLANO MALL IS TERRIBLE!!! I PURCHASED MY DAUGHTER A RANGE ROVER POWER WHEEL FOR $700 FOR HER 2ND BIRTHDAY APRIL 8TH PAID IN FULL THRY ASKED IF I WANTED IT DELIVERED THE SAME DAY AND I ASKED IT TO BE DELIVERED BETWEEN THE 21ST AND THE 24TH FOR HER ACTUAL BIRTHDAY AND PARTY. WE AGREED. APRIL 23RD I CALLED TO ASK ABOUT THE DELIVERY OR IF I NEEDED TO PICK IT UP AND THE GUY HENRY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT WEEK AS HE DIDN'T HAVE IT ANY MORE, I TOLD HIM THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO MY DAUGHTER PARTY BEING THE 24TH AND THAT WAS HER MAIN GIFT HE SAID HE WOULD SEE IF HE COULD GET ONE FROM THE SANTA ROSA LOCATION. WELL I GUESS THEY WERE SOLD OUT TO CAUSE HE CALLS BACK TO TELL ME ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PINK ONES HAVE BEEN RECALLED AND HE HCAN GIVE ME ANOTHER COLOR . I PAID FOR PINK, CASH MONEY, UP FRONT NOT BLUE NOT RED!! I THEN GOOGLED TO SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING ABOUT A RECALL ALSO ASKED HIM TO PROVIDE ME SOMETHING SHOWING IT WAS RECALLED OR I WOULD TAKE THEM TO COURT OF COURSE THEY HAD NOTHING. THEY HAD SOLD A CAR MY DAUGHTER CAR THAT WAS ALREADY BOUGHTAND PAID FOR, SO MY DAUGHTER HAD NO CAR FOR ENTRY OF HER PARTY THE MAIN EVENT. DO NOT SHOP AT ZAZA TOYS THEY ARE MONEY HUNGRY INCONSIDERATE PEOPLE!! And I WILL SEE THEM IN COURT< /review>

<review>JCPennys need to have more entrances. It is hard if you are handicap. You can not try on items,so you buy and if doesn't  fit you have to return. Also no one on second floor to help when needed.<//review></record>

The mall itself is pretty clean. The stores also are pretty clean.  I see some customers walking around the mall with their masks on their chin or no mask at all. I have the understanding we are all to wear a mask at all times in the mall unless we are eating or drinking. I hate wearing my mask but I do wear it for you. Be safe everybody.<//Text>

It's always a great place to shop or hang out. 🥰  The Indian shop was so cool. I'm definitely going back to that store so I can decorate my house with some rustic western iteam.< /Text>

The taco place is the best at eatery section.

Very interesting mall with a lot of good stores and food courts. But, because of the pandemia probably, I didn’t see people. I hope everything will be back like before this horrible invisible virus<//Review>

<Review>This mall has really gone downhill. It's not a safe place to go. Many of the good stores are gone and replaced with ghetto small shops run by hustlers. It needs a major overhaul or shut down.< /Review>< user_name>

Nice place and great for shopping, I don’t really like the store options though, Forever 21 should be re-added, Brandy Melville, American eagle, etc. Would bring many more customers< /text>

Small selections at most of their stores. Visited on Saturday and saw people walking around (NOT SITTING AND EATING) with no masks or wearing them around their chin. No mask enforcement from staff/security. I would avoid this mall until we get a hold of Covid.</Review>< Pics>

<text>The atmosphere was a little depressing due to COVID restrictions. Only a handful of people are allowed in the Lids store. There was another store that only allowed three customers at a time. Most stores are open but the hours of some stores are inconsistent. The highlight of my experience was Hot Dog On A Stick. Wetzels was open also.</text>< gmap_id>

Fancy mall, it is two stories, loads of shops, including a build a bear, and a few oddities. The ferris wheel is a fun addition, as are the massage chairs, however the restrooms could use more signage to more easily find them.< /text>

The mall is ok. The place so quiet. But it's dieing and it might be happening sooner rather than later because of COVID. The stores seem to be selling the same kind of things. A lot of stores are closed or are closing earlier than they used to. I don't recommend this mall if you have a choice.< /Review>

This place is emptying of stores. It is really sad how many empty spots. That and not working escalators and elevators makes it hard to enjoy the mall. Looking forward to the day that Dave and Busters opens though. And the theatre again.</text>

Very crowded over the holidays. It's a bit of a covid risk at the moment.</Review>

<user>110901696196084927641</user><review>We super duper like this mall. It's very clean and welcoming. There is a play area for the kids, a great food court with many popular favorites,  elevators and escalators, restaurants, even a movie theater! Many places in the plazas that surround this mall, like fudruckers, chevys, mimis cafe, barnes and noble, etc. Its become a place we travel to for a nice day out.< /review>< gmap_id>

The Mall has lost quality shops over the years and constantly filling them with fly by night shops. I know it's not politically correct, but the mall needs to enforce their own rules.
A bigger local police presence might help. The security which is often visible, is limited in what they can do.< /Review><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80851426cf2065bb:0x5fd28f70e598cc93</gmapID></record>

Lots of cool places, but lacks a friendly vibe. So many places are understaffed and undertrained. Still a nice mall with lots of variety in the stores.<//Review>

This mall’s escalator was out of commission months before COVID. They’re opened back up and it still doesn’t work. You mean to tell me for the moths the mall was closed, they couldn’t fix this damn thing. You have a people looking real scary walking up and down this death trap. Just waiting for a law suite to happen.</review>

Friendly staff! Amazing array of stores theres a little bit of everything for everyone in the mall. U can shop, get ur nails done, head into the barbershop, and then get a tattoo on ur way out to the food court to get lunch and or possibly see a movie. This mall is GREAT!<//text>

Since I only visit Macys for cosmetics or  purses and I don't venture out into the mall,  I can't really say how the rest of the mall is. It used to be fine to walk around in there 25 years ago, but since then too many stories have surfaced that make it a scary place.</text>

Theater was filthy and gross, pop corn every where puddles of unknown liquids on the ground and the seats were all stained and disgusting and completely outdated. It looks super nice and  appealing from the outside but different story on the inside. I wanted to ask for my money back we decided to rough it out. I will never return nor do I recommend coming here. Drive a little more down the freeway and go to brenden in vacaville.< /text>

The mall is making a comeback and stores like Virtual-Framing are part of that comeback!

This place offers affordable custom framing at far better prices than the big box stores.

Framed art and digital printing at great prices and no need for fake coupons.</Review>

Bert and I couldn't believe how big this mall is.  The only difference that we could see between this mall & Stanford Mall in Palo Alto,  Ca. Is that Solano mall is fully enclosed!< /text>

Solano Town Center also known as Solano Mall seems to have improved over the past few years. The selection of stores is okay for a smaller city. The inside is clean and there are ample places to sit and rest. It is a bit dim inside and could use some brighter lighting and I think they rely a bit too much on the skylights. The outskirts of the mall, stores outside the mall proper, has a variety of restaurants, a Trader Joe's, Michael's and a Ross, so if you can't find what you need IN the mall maybe you can  in the surrounding stores. There are EV chargers on the North side of the mall and 2 at Macys. Be careful in the parking lot as it does have its share of shady characters. Otherwise, it's a good place to find what you need.<//review>

< review>
Like most malls, this definitely got hurt by Amazon. Closed in,  2 floors, and very bad selection of stores. Way too many stagnant shoe stores, weird off-brand clothes (low quality, trashy?), the food court is lacking in areas other than fast food (Panda express, mcdonalds). The only good part about the mall is that it's the only good thing in the area. Definitely would not reccomend, its a chore to shop or to even explore here.</review>

Great shopping mall with plenty of stores to browse in. Big Name anchor stores are full-sized and have speciality departments at each one I visited. The is an art gallery and a gaming lounge as well as the theaters which really make this mall a hub of activity and a great experience every time I come here. Nothing but good feels about this place.</Text>

It’s an amazing place when you need something super last minute you can come to the solano mall and find what you need the games are really helpful because my brother is not the person that likes to shop so we let him play and then we get our shopping done they have wonderful people there’s great prices even though some can be a little pricey.</review>

There are some good restaurants inside as well, and a bunch of stores I've never bothered going inside. They do have a Sears, which I recommend checking out during a sale, if you have the patience for large crowds. Restrooms are generally clean, there are family friendly restrooms as well, and a play area for small children-you have to supervise them though.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80851426cf2065bb:0x5fd28f70e598cc93<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Just another big shopping center with a number of shops. You could probably spend an entire day here shopping, if you didn’t know what you were shopping for, walking around all stores. Nice sized food court. Two story building and plenty of parking.</review>

<date>1577994691301< /date><text>There are several factors that are preventing this mall from being any better than what it is. The most significant is the ownership/management keeps changing which prevents the operation of this mall from realizing it's full potential to increase foot traffic and community space--it appears to be going in the right direction but could be doing a lot more. The idea of a centralized shopping mall was born out of a now archaic idea, hence, the failure of malls being stuck in the past and not forging into the future of adapting and innovating to meet the needs of the community and commercial trends. The 80s were years of capitalistic endeavors and excess--now, there is a bit of restraint and consciousness that curtails this to a certain extent. The "mall" concept cannot fight commercial trends nor change them enough to the point that it can drastically increase foot traffic and spending--there may be blips here and there but that brings to the second major factor that the mall can work towards is to increase its appeal to the community that supports the mall with more than just retail.

One of the unique appeals that demonstrates this, is the art gallery in the mall--I'm a huge fan of art, and by default since I consider myself an artist on several levels. This is an example of adapting, albeit there is no economic activity, it does support community and culture at least. If this were the 80s, it would be absurd to have an art gallery in the mall and I would laugh along with every 80s person at that time but now, it's making sense that community spaces should conglomerate into the mall, where storefronts give way to e-commerce and warehouses instead. Bringing in more service-based business also makes sense and of course you cannot go wrong with food/restaurant as well. The owner/operator of the mall should look into bringing in non-profit groups to increase foot traffic, offering workshops and seminars (in the empty spaces), maybe converting an empty space into a community rental space, for example. I was also a huge fan of the city operating services at the mall as well. I took advantage on several occasions before the advent of online services.

Also, the shrinking of luxury retailers in a shifting economy and demographics away from excess (and illogical) spending--should there really be that many jewelry stores in this mall? Prolly not. I did find it nifty that a college tried to have a branch in the mall but they must not have found it "profitable" enough. Perhaps that could be attempted again but with the community college or other public (cheaper) alternative.

Personally, I was never a fan the mall's approach some odd years ago to move all food kiosks/small restaurants into the food court area--the mall should dotted here and there to spread out the foot traffic. It looks like they are getting back into that layout.

I also have many gripes with the security (if that hasn't changed as well) and the limitations are too limiting. Private security makes sense on smaller scales--I think it makes sense of epic proportions to have city police officers permanently assigned to the mall, at least two. Presence alone does wonders! Not just the mall proper, but parking lots, connecting strip malls as well. Crime in the parking lots alone is enough to disrupt business and the impact on social/community cohesion is quite strong. Again, police presence really makes an impact. I love how the Vallejo PD are on bikes in downtown Vallejo during the farmer's markets. I would love seeing the same happen for the mall.

Collecting my thoughts and ideas back into focus--not all malls should be approached the same either, nor have the same intentions and goals in mind. There ought to be a sense of uniqueness and identity created. I don't expect franchises and retailers to setup shop here that are just a town away for more of the same, I expect more of a diverse "portfolio" of what the mall can offer. Local economy should be the key stone here. People should come together with the mall owner/management and lay out a plan for that.< /text><rate>4< /rate><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80851426cf2065bb:0x5fd28f70e598cc93<//gmapID><name>Aaron J Garcia<//name><user>106592008159121829310<//user>< pics>

<Review>Standard mall. It has all the basics. It used to have a Chick Fil-A until it moved outside the mall really close to the freeway. We mainly come here for Red Robin. But, whenever there's a wait for a table, it's really convenient to have all the shops to kill the time.< /Review><gmapID>0x80851426cf2065bb:0x5fd28f70e598cc93</gmapID><Rating>4<//Rating><Time>1532365728153</Time></record>

Good parking and a decent selection of stores. The food court is decent. Avoid - like don’t go to Red Robin. Service is terrible and food is marginal. They should pay you to eat there.</text>

Above average for your shopping experience. Needs more policing and more rest stops. Some retail shop need upgrades. Need better dinning restaurants</Text>

<text>A nice mall with a little bit of everything. Amusement, restaurants and specialty stores from jewlwery to clothes can be found. Even on the outskirts of the mall can be found more stores and services like medical, banking, grocery and auto repair and gas. A nice place to see a movie or get shopping done.< /text>< GmapID>

<review>This mall used to be kind of so-so but they seem to have made a lot of changes over the past few years. I actually like coming here again, lol. They have a lot as far as dining goes too, a lot of newer restaurants within and surrounding the actual mall. Looks like they have been doing a better job at maintainence as well. Not quite Sun Valley yet but definitely worth coming here.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Nice shopping center with a lot of foods and brand stores available. The dinning area is a bit uncomfortable in my opinion; I guess since there is no privacy and too much open space with crowded chairs and tables. There should be benches around the mall. That would be nice.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I really like this Mall. Has many play areas and places for kids. Food area, family room where you can seat with your baby and can breatfeed and relax. Changing diapers tables, microwave, and family restroom all in a place. I love it.</Review>

I had my daughter with me so i asked how much it was for both of us she replied by pointing at the sign and stated "its right there." I tried asking her if it was 3.00 per person and she walked away and ignored me. I was hurt by this because I was completely respectful towards her. I know today was a busy day but that does not give any employee the right to be rude. She is working around kids so that just makes matters worst setting a bad example. I hope whoever employed her makes a better choice next time.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80851426cf2065bb:0x5fd28f70e598cc93<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you are looking for a decent indoor shopping mall, Solano Town Center may satisfy nicely.  Indoor shops include the Disney Store, Forever 21, Old Navy, Edwards Movie Theater and many others.  In the immediate surrounding area you can find a 5 Guys Burgers and Fries restaurant, Trader Joe's, Chick-fil-A and dozens more all within 5 minutes driving time.</text>

Clean and has most of the shipping that you would want.  Did court has a decent selection for lunch toe meals.  The movie theatre is pretty good with stadium seating and 16 theaters.  There are a couple of chain restaurants.  It is missing an anchor store but hopefully they will fill that vacancy soon< /Text>

I'm not typically a mall person but this one's not that bad. There's a lot to do with your little kids, they have a jump/hop store that's $10 for all all day play which is awesome if you can bring someone to watch them play while you shop. They have a carousel that has two stories, playgrounds, Bungie jump, these weird huge animal things you ride and a train that goes around the mall. They also have a build a bear workshop, a Disney store, arcade, movie theater and candy stores so there's legit tons of stuff to do with the kiddos. For the teens and adults there's all the standard clothes stores, GameStop, and food. Not a bad place to blow a few hours< /Text>

It's a mall, with stores and crowded parking like every other shopping center in America. I've never had anything bad to say about this place, except that it's not in a very good part of town. They need to get more security to actually drive around instead of parking somewhere along the parking lot and looking down at there phone< /Text>

<text>So much to do so little time unless u know what ur getting ark on that side to get in n out expect to walk around for at least 1 hours to 3 hours to do what you want and to window shop. Nice store fronts cool new toys to look at every personal interest at your feet. They have giant maps through the walk area to see where everything is and where you are at so you can map your time out. Loads of different food  even healthy  items food court or restauran.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

This place has a decent sized library and has a pond in the back. Every year they stock it with fish and have fishing tournaments for the kids. There's benches to sit at and relax with a fountain in the middle of one have of the pond. It's a beautiful place to relax and there's usually always a few people fishing with their kids.< /Text>

<username>Jada Butcher</username><text>The Solano Mall is a weird thing. Half of the mall looks really great, and they other half looks like they just ran out of money for the remodel. Has a food court, though don't go looking for any exciting options. Has all your major store. Gets very, very busy during the holidays as its the only mall in-between Vacaville and Concord.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

< Review>
I used to love this mall, and some of the stores I still do. However, 2 things you should be aware of: #1 beware of closing time. If you get stuck on the wrong side or floor of the mall, you're going to be forced to go outside and take stairs to get back to your car. They don't care if you have little children or are 9 months pregnant & it is freezing outside. Especially beware of H & M, their employees are SO RUDE about closing time and they trap you on the top floor (with only an exit going outside) if you want to buy anything. 2nd, beware of the carousel at closing time. They have totally rude employees, two creepy males I am speaking of in particular, who close it down early (8:40 instead of 9). They don't care if you JUST bought a ticket (in front of him I might add, but he couldn't tell you they were closed) or that your 2 year old was so excited to ride. They are on their cell phones the whole time. One even started the ride before I had my child completely secure. Never going there again.< /Review>

Nightmare shopping center. So big you cannot see from one side to the other. The nameless entrances to parking areas are 5 lanes wide with stop​ lights and dedicated left turn lanes. If this is the only place l can find something, I'll live without it.< /text>

Fifteen years ago this was a nice mall with a Chick- Fill-a but what I used to love the most, was the huge major department stores. I remember there was A two floor Mervyns with a full service hallmark card department and A Three floor Sears with huge appliance and electronic departments and I also remember Macy's had a full crystal ware department and JCPenney had photos with Santa during The Holidays. Fast forward fifteen years  both Mervyns and Sears left ,The Macy's and JCPenney stores here are not what they used to be and the entire mall is mash up of name brand and knock off stores and also a lot of overpriced "real gold and silver jewelry" kiosks. Though there are a few big name and quality stores like Dicks Sporting Goods and H&M not to mention there a lot of good athletic shoe stores here like Shoe Palace that are still worth coming here for anymore. I also want to add that this mall has a notorious reputation for being dangerous and unsafe due to the high number of crimes in and around the mall. I personally have fond memories here  but I rarely  come unless I need something last minute or I need to go to Dicks Sporting Goods but I still give it three stars, Just for the memories of the past.< /text>

Also have stylish clothing stores for men as well. One of my fav malls I've ever shopped at by far. Good for kids & family too with a wide variety of big restaurants and tasty treat venders plus a big, beautiful carousel smack dab in the walking/browsing area! Hip; Clean and safe; easily accessible from freeways.
Shoot... I could spend a whole weekend here! I'm serious 😋<//Review>< pictures>

<review>The main shopping center in Fairfield, it's mostly what you would expect from a normal suburban shopping mall.  It has a large, modern Edwards Theatre, and two levels with lovely lighting from sky lights.  It feels very airy and open inside.  It's great for an easy day of shopping and walking around in Fairfield, and provides most of what you would be looking for.</review>< pictures>

They have the worst customer service EVER !!! One of the employees was walking by when we had asked if we could get a size and she rudely said what shirt do you need quickly because I am helping another customer I am not even suppose to be over here when she could have said it in a different tone, and then we had asked to use the restroom and she gave an attitude. Idk if I wanna come back to this place ever !!<//text>

< review>
It's by far my favorite mall at the moment. Spacious, plenty parking. Movie theater, build a bear, carousel, very kid friendly. A really cool new play place, if you've been to the Tanforan mall its the same as the one there, I forget the name but it's next to JC Penny on the second floor. Pretty cool food court. My favorite feature is the family lounge. Individual curtained off slots for nursing, t.v., changing stations, microwave, family bathroom.</review>

We love the Solano Town Center!
They are now having art classes for kids inside Macy's.  What a great way to support the arts in our community. Are family also enjoys the Fairfield Suisun Visual Arts gallery in the mall.

Can't believe people like this place.  I grew up coming to the Solano mall even before I could drive.  That was more than 20 years ago.  It was mostly a dump then and it still feels like a dump now.  Minimal maintenance, dirty, lack of reinvestment.  Same tired old stores from 10+ years ago that haven't been painted or updated.< /text>

Great place to shop and hang out, shame about all the shadow people and the heterosexuals infesting the place, indoctrinating my child. All he wants to do is wear his Mable sweater and enjoy life, and here are these unidentifiable entities of absolute Vanta black slappin' their meats in his auras. Also the Spencer's there has syphilis. love you big mama<//text>

Cashiers are RUDE at Sears. In line for 20 minutes in the same spot. Cashiers should not be opening accounts when there's a long line. Have a designated cashier for that purpose only. Needless to say I put all the merchandise back and went to JC Penney. Would not let me posted without a start so you get one under duress.<//review>

My daughter loves coming here with her friends, and all the different kinds of stores really excite her.  I, however, am not so excited about walking around so much to find what I am looking for.</text>

I only go when I absolutely have to.  I don't feel safe when I'm there.  Especially when I'm there with my kids.  People constantly staring or following us around.  Out of control teenagers are also a major problem.<//text>

Not a bad place, but there is no one store to get people there. Seems like there is a lot of store turnover.< /text>

Maybe the rents to high, but they need to bring in more high end stores. The food court is ok. To many thrift shop type stores throughout the mall. Center isle of mall is  flooded with knockoff jewelers. 1 end of the mall has a playground which was ok, then they put in a huge carousel in the middle of the mall. Then they added electric animal riding scooters for kids and parents to ride around in. Now they have a train that cruises the mall walk ways. It's a disaster! Like what is going on here. All they are missing is a juggling act and animals doing tricks and it would be a full fledged circus. Bring in cabellas, bass pro shop, Louie Vitton, crate and barrel, ect... it's really sad seeing this mall head the direction it is. If you are looking for cheap, made in China, products solano mall has a bunch of stores that I'm sure you would love.</review>

I used to love this mall especially because  they had that family restroom. My daughters could go in to a potty their size I could nurse my son while they played or watched tv. That was until I was on in the mall a lot during my maternity leave and adult men who obviously worked there would come in to use the bathroom  instead of walking the few steps to the men's room. He was a big guy walking into a room full of women and children and I thought it was inappropriate. When I brought my concerns to the mall manager. He basically talked down to me and tried to placate me by saying it was a restroom for everyone but it isn't it's for children mom's and dads. Not for lazy security men who think walking into a room of nursing mom to go number 2 in the kids bathroom  is acceptable.</text>

The Solano County Town Center has provided local artists a beautiful space to showcase our orginal art. It is on the second floor next to AT&T  - spave5  D8.  They are open Wednesday through Sunday from 11:00 to 6:00.  Stop buy - take a look - and if you find that something special purchase it</Review>

Nice medium size mall with major retail stores such Macy's, Best Buy, JC Penney, and more.  Have lunch or dinner at Applebees or Red Robin after shopping.  To end the day of shopping why not watch a movie at Edwards Regal IMAX!< /Review>

Lots of vacant spaces and a dwindling food court ruled by the big name places. Environment is still clean if only they could relocate the mall to a safer location.< /Review>

<Review>This is one of the best Starbucks I've been too. They make my order exactly how I like . The other Starbucks have poor service, there's a  new SB in Suisun that makes sorry drinks , I've had to return my order several times bc they use too much milk. The SB on N.Texas near chevron  has a few employees who are lazy and have an attitude when express dissatisfaction.

This SB rocks !<//Review>< pictures>

Just a check up at the dentist. The mall itself is rather dull. Not even a Hallmark store anymore to buy cards.< /review>

<review>It’s a pretty good mall, I like the food court a lot!  There is an elevator down stairs by the merry go round though that gets stuck with people in it& the call button doesn’t work. We were stuck in there with handicapped people in 2 wheelchairs and not one person came to help. After pressing buttons after buttons over n over it finally opened after 15 minutes. We could see we were stuck on the bottom floor so when we got out we asked the guy at the jewelry store didn’t you hear us screaming n he just sat there staring at us while he continued talking on his cell phone. He was less than 15 feet away n did nothing!  We talked to another mall employee they said people get stuck all the time in there. Someone needs to fix this problem ASAP!!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Ilove our mall; with great forsight it has the potential to be a regional mall serving the North Bay. I believe it's  possibly  ready for a Nordstrom, as well as with some cretive design  a third level.< /review>

It's a mall... major stores include BestBuy, Sears, JCPennys, Macys, Forever 21, ULTA!!! There is also a Rasputins which is really cool if you're into music,  Payless, AT&T, T-mobile, Sprint, Victoria Secret, Bath and Body Works, Cinnabon, Verison and the movies.. there are more stores but compared to like SF, it really isn't that big... but it's where all us locals go!< /Text>

< review>
It is not in a safe area of town. Many thefts happen daily in the stores people are never made aware of. Civilians themselves have been robbed, injured, had vehicles broken into or stolen, severely hurt and even killed. MANY large groups of teens and young adults linger here out of boredom and like to intimidate others.

As a woman, or a teenager, I wouldn't ever suggest going alone! There are very few stores that I would be hard pressed to need to go into for me to go to the mall. The only visits I make are to the movie theater which is on the outside of it and that is primarily it.

I find it sad considering this is pretty much all we have unless you travel out of town. It has been this way for several years now and not getting any better.< /review>

<review>It gets a bad rating because they made me stop taking photographs of the businesses inside the mall. I was confronted by 3 security guards and they requested I stop taking pictures inside the mall. I told them I was adding images for Google Maps and they still told me to stop. Kind of petty!< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Huge modern and chic shopping center with enough stores to shop. Children can be kept busy in a play park. Or can go with a train. There are eateries everywhere for the hungry visitors. This shopping center is definitely recommended.

Enorm modern en chique winkelcentrum met genoeg winkels om te shoppen. Kinderen kunnen bezig worden gehouden in een speelparkje. Of kunnen met een treintje mee. Voor de hongerige bezoekers zijn er overal  eettentjes. Een aanrader is dit winkelcentrum beslist.</Text>
