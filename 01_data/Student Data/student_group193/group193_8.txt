< review>
Second time coming here in a few years since they took over the previous Mexican restaurant that was here I think it was called Las Palmas.

First time I ordered burritos here and the food was just okay because the rice in the burrito was hard like it was undercooked and thought that maybe it was a one time thing and I was just not lucky that day.

This second time visiting I ordered burritos and "super tacos". There was nothing super about the tacos.  Two pieces of very dry tortillas that was on the grill top too long with a bit of cheese and topped with very dry salty Carne asada. That's it. Nothing super about that taco. Was expecting fluffy tortillas with juicy beef and some onions cilantro and maybe tomatoes with a hint of lime. Nope.. The burritos I ordered were "wet burritos" which is a burrito in a red sauce which I think it is enchilada sauce? First burrito was carne asada and second was al pastor (pork). Both burritos were generous sized and filling but the rice was hard and undercooked.  The Carne asada filling was dry and salty. The al pastor pork meat was better but a bit flavorless. There was very minimal salsa in the burritos so it was a bit in the dry side.  The beans inside were good though,  I liked them.  The red enchilada sauce that makes it a "wet burrito" was just too salty which hid the flavors of all the ingredients in that sauce.

I gave the review 3 stars only because the food i got was just a bit less than okay but the staff was really nice.  I'm sure there must be other food there that might be better tasting.<//review>

Delicious pupusas are served with a sweet-flavored curtido that carries a mildly spicy aftertaste. My favorite dish is the 1/2 crispy soft taco served with lime and radish slices.</text>< pictures>

Only one other table, they came in after me. Peeked behind the counter, one cook was glued to their phone, heard the server joking around with the other cook in the kitchen. At half an hour after ordering, the other table's food got served first, so I asked about mine. Server never put the order in. Only two orders in the whole place, she forgot one of them and didn't bother to even take a single look into the dining room and realize my order wasn't being made. Like, wow, man, this wasn't prime lunch hour, I've worked plenty food service jobs, I'd understand if it was busy. This was swinging at a T-ball and missing. Asked for it to go instead, and the ground beef burrito tasted like a white lady named Karen made it. No seasoning, maybe they sprinkled a tiny little bit of red pepper on it. My breath tasted like I'd just eaten In N Out. Absolutely not going back, no reason to whatsoever. Taco Bell would've worked out better for me, and I gagged a little bit typing that.< /review><UserId.>113412771759107198851<//UserId.>< name>

Very rude and argumentative!! Last night my girlfriend and I were parking in between this restaurant and another business and one of the staff blocked our car! He came out and started yelling at us so we called the police. When they arrived they told him to move and apologized to us for being hassled. Do not give this place business!!!<//review>

If you like flavorful mexican food, this is your place. If you like papusas then go here. Personally, I love the super carnitas quesadillas.  But tacos and burritos are fantastic too. It's important to be Patient too. They make everything tastey<//Review>

Great standby Salvadorian mexican restaurant ,  with traditional tasting Pupusas, and straight ahead tacos, served in a family setting, often with catholic services on the large screen TV, reminding you to tip well or face the wrath of God. If you've never had a pupusa, get a beef one, and marvel at what can only be described as a savory stuffed tortilla, served with a sauce similar to coleslaw, called, "Curtido" (Pickled Cole Slaw) in a red salsa. The food has been a little hit or miss sometimes, but still tasty.<//Review>

I love the pupusas rebueltas (mixed carnitas/beans/cheese) and pupusas zucchini/cheese. I've tried the pupusas at several other places, and I like these best - the innards are mixed well, are seasoned well, and the tortillas portion is just slightly silky to the tongue. The cabbage salsa that comes with them is awesome and sometimes has different types of cabbage in it. I've had these in the restaurant and to go, it's great both ways (the paper plate to go sometimes doesn't hold up against the cutting because of  the steaming). Sometimes the tomato sauce is mixed in with the cabbage, which works okay. I also like the carne asada street tacos served with radishes and lime wedges.< /text>

I went here ages ago for a burrito, and decided that Chipotle or Gordos was a better option.

Just went back for Pupusas awhile ago, and was stunned.  This place has*great* pupusas!!

Have been back 3x since.  Always great.

2 caveats: they make the pupusas while you wait, and I've generally waited~15 mins when ordering 4-6.  (Drank a horchata while waiting.  Yum!)

2nd point -- the venue is full of local color.  Try not to judge the food by the variety of folk coming in for a bite.  I've seen homeless folks, poor folks, and working class galore.</text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) I do not like to leave comments but we found it a little expensive, we ordered 6 popusas, a pie, a quesadilla for a total of 40 Dollars. Popusas say they were at 2.50 for 6 popusas there are only 15 dollars. Everything did not look expensive. We asked for the receipt he promised to give it to me but he never handed it to me. My friends charged them and they told me that I was charging them dearly. My friend had told us that he had been given bad service before, but we had a craving for popusas and we went anyway. The popusas were almost made of pure mass with very little reyeno. We did not eat agusto and left almost everything. Well that was my experience.

A mi no me gusta dejar comentarios pero se nos hizo poquito caro, pedimos 6 popusas, una empanada, una quesadilla por un total de 40 Dollares. Las popusas dicen que estában a 2.50 por 6 popusas ahí solo son 15 Dolares. Todo no se miraba caro. Le pedimos el recibo prometió dármelo pero nunca me lo entregó. Mis amigos les cobre y me decían que les estaba cobrando muy caro. Mi amigo nos había alvertido  que ya le habían dado mal servicio antes, pero  teníamos antojo de popusas y de todas maneras fuimos. Las popusas estaban casi hechas de pura masa con muy poco reyeno. Ya no comimos agusto y dejamos casi todo. Bueno esa fue mi experiencia.</review>

It's hard to find good honest service these days so its exciting  when you do find one. I came have a tire checked out for a possible flat, we were greeted with a smile (point) ask what we needed and listened (point) then he dismounted the tire but to our surprise there was nothing to fix. He then gave us useful information and sent us on our way. We asked what was the cost of the service and with that same smile just said "don't worry just keep an eye on the tire and come back in case you need to replace it I'll be glad to help" (extra point) If you need some tires or just have a flat stop by and see what I mean by great service!  You know I'm coming back for my next set of tires.< /Text>

He was very nice but, I just found out the tire I purchased from him had a dummy patch on it and that was not told to me before I purchased it. So if you come here ask to inspect your tire first and have them dip it in water.< /review>

<text>Honest good prices the timing belt change was cheap just under $200.00 it's divided into two sections the front end is the mechanical work and the Rear is the tire shop the only thing missing there is an Auto Electrician they don't do any electrical work therefore only a 3 star Auto Repair shop, with an auto Electrician on hand it could definitely be a 5 star shop.<//text>< pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>Big Daddy's Tires & Wheel, 399 W. Valley Blvd, Colton Ca 92324. I went here based on a recommendation from one of the guys at work. One of my tires had developed a very slow leak, and I wasn't sure what was wrong with it or if it was fixable. Within less than 15 minutes of pulling through the gate, he had my wheel off the car, nail located and removed, tire off the wheel, patched it, tire back on the wheel, tested the patch, and wheel back on the car. This super fast and efficient work cost me only $10. He was also very courteous, and professional. I would definitely go there again. He was also kind enough to inform me (and better yet, show me) that the tire has a little extra wear on one side, and I should have the alignment checked (probably when I get my next oil change, which I'm almost due for).</text><Response>None<//Response>< name>

I went in expecting a great experience from all the reviews I've read. However, Jasmin W. is just too cold for my vibe. I ask for one thing and every time she just says "anything else?" Which may seem like she is being friendly but her tone is super condescending, it makes you feel like you are being rushed. They also have daily deals here but she won't explain them to you, it just feels like she is rushing you out, which is strange for a business who is in sales. I would recommend that management train their employees to provide the best deal possible. If I ask for X and X then Jasmin should say "if you do that, you can get this promo OR if you switch to this, you get this free" you will make more money that way and the customer will feel like you took care of them. All other budtenders are cool. But I feel now like I should phone in to make sure she isn't working ahead of time.< /Text>

If the show Cheers was set at a dispensary. Great neighborly vibes with honest bud‐tenders. Lots of deals especially after you join the loyalty program.< /Review>

<text>They include all taxes in the cost you  see which is convenient. They stock great choices in flower and concentrates.

However, Flora Verde always has promos such as an early customer 10% off before 11 am. Also, this place is located in a very busy parking lot. Still, I will be coming back.</review>< Pics>

I am not sure what that one reviewer is talking about tension between managers and workers here? I didn’t get that vibe when I was there. Front desk is always nice and so are the bud tenders. Good service and products. Tax included and great deals weekly.  The flower ranges from cheap to expensive and the quality is always there. The wax selection is good enough and always has something I want.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I’ve been a returning face at Flora Verde since April and I’ve always received the top shelf quality, customer service and awesome prices. But today they went above and beyond. One of there awesome employees, Dimitri, recommendation was so spot on I had to share my experience. Thank you all at Flora Verde please keep up the amazing job.

Just wanted to update everyone on how awesome Flora Verde is!! Haven’t been by in a while because of low funds and finally came by. Wow!! First time trying the under top shelf buds and they blew me away! Dimitri always hooks up the fire! Thanks again Flora Verde!<//Review>< Pics>

Always fast, friendly service! I also love how the taxes are included in their very competitive prices, no need to do math to figure out your real total. Been a customer for over 6 months and love this place :)<//review>

So I used to enjoy this shop, but the level of customer service depends on who helps you. The manager, she is short with dark hair, is an emotional wreck 95% of the time. Most the time she isn't wearing her mask and is giving a lot of attitude, and I'm tired of it. You can literally feel the tension between her and the employees. It was so much better when the owners were around. I'm sorry but you put your trust in someone who isn't capable. I'll be back when this is addressed until then ill spend my money elsewhere.< /Text>

Phenominal shop here, people behind the counter have been extremely helpful. Have been here a few times and usually have been helped by the lightskin guy with the curly hair, dude knows exactly what you need based on what you describe what you are looking for. Top notch customer service, really appreciate the input. The guy who helped me recommended some very good bud and concentrate to go with for a decent price compared to other medical dispensaries, and the product is fire🔥 Thanks again</review>

<text>Amazing service.  The delivery driver (Chris) went above and beyond to accommodate my needs when I got lost coming back in time from my bank- I am relatively new to the area.  Not only was he a sweetheart, but the people on the other end of the line at the brick and mortar location were also so nice helping me to find the flowers/plants for my specific condition(s).  This is one shop I can honestly say wants to actually improve the lives of their customers.<//text></record>

The clerks behind the counter are very knowledgeable and are more than patient to answer any questions you might have about their products. Also, the people at the front desk are extremely friendly and welcoming. The product that I bought (this was my first time visit) was very satisfying and met my needs!  I’m anxious to visit and buy from them within the next few days. I’ve been telling all my friends about this amazing dispensary.< /Text>

<Text>A ton of product and super cool people running the joint! They even have the Lagunitas THC drinks. Hard to find but so delicious! Great pricing on pre-rolls and the flower selection is on point. If you haven’t made it over yet, what are you waiting for?? If you don’t have your medical card, don’t sweat it. It takes about 10 minutes online and you’re in business!! This is the way a dispensary should look and feel. Groovy place and people!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

First recreational place in all of Cali, Portland, Denver and Vegas I’ve been to that requires you to buy a random card to buy recreationally.  Seems like a way just to make a few extra bucks on top for them...? Didn’t make it in since $25 for a card seemed silly</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This was my first going in one since the older "illegal" ones went down. I'm very very disappointed that there are no longer $5 grams. The cheapest is now $12. Plus everything is packaged so you can't really see or smell most of the product. I bought some of the ones they had samples to smell.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1580330674172< /Date><Gmap_id>0x80dc758313ca2125:0xacd3061adcb74680</Gmap_id>< Resp>

Went there today after work as always 15 to 25 minute wait time when I asked the girl if it would be longer than 10 minute wait I was told to cool my Jets very unhappy with the place got better things to do than to sit there and wait for them and if it takes that long to serve one customer I don't need to be going there and I won't be going there any more!!!<//Review>

<review>Extremely pleased and happy with this shop. Not only are the staff down-to-earth people with quality personalities, their prices are cheaper and include tax, so no surprises at checkout. Picked up 1/4 for 55$ with a BOGO they had going on. Also Picked up a Hi-Fi Hops, the Lagunitas THC + CBD Infused Hop Drink. Overall I'm stoked for such a great shop to be in Vista and look forward to seeing them thrive.</review>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><text>They are dishonest. The description on the pallet/lots is misleading. I ended up with a lot of shoes with no pairs to them and empty boxes. The workers even admit to stealing or going through the pallets to get the good items. This is not the first time items are missing from the pallets. Another issues is the transparency for the items they sell, they will sell you broken items/trash and that is nowhere to be found in the item description. If something is broken and beyond repair it should no be put up for sale thats just a SCAM. This is the only bad auction house I have encountered. The one in lancaster,sylmar are great places to buy. If something is broken,missing parts they will let you know in the description. Stay away from buena park unless you went and inspected the items youre going to bid on, take pictures! Items go missing after pallets are sold!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2bf3480018db:0xf158f3fbe8edc2b1< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

How could you let one of the top employees go ???? He handled all my needs with PROFESSIONAL curticy , and with no mistakes always working hard working up a sweat.

It was set up nice And the people that work there were friendly Where friendly. The big negative though is it had rained and they did bother the Tarp any of the merchandise There will several pallets of clothing I was gonna bid on but they were soaking wet Now that's just pure laziness or stupidity .<//text>

<text>Monica that works in the Office is Extremely helpful & Nice!
She deserves 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟FiVE STARS

Be sure to check the items you purchase. Closely Verify that EVERYTHING ON the invoice IS What's BEING BROUGHT OUT TO YOU. ( someone may accidently switch your items for an older version)PAY close ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS (Lot #'s,Brand,model#,etc....Smfh

Ex: If I bid on & Win Two Sony speakers, when I pick them up I would expect just that. Not to find that there's only one Sony speaker, and some old rusty off brand that you can barely even read the Brand....

Also I've been waiting for the difference of the $200 i paid for registration on a van i purchased months ago. I contacted them but haven't heard anything yet.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I purchased a trailer and the whole process was extremely smooth.  The people were very nice to work with.  LaLa did all of my paperwork and she couldn't have been nicer.  She knew me by name each time I called.  Antoine was also excellent and even took more pictures of the trailer before we picked it up.  I would also like to thank the general manager Giuseppe Coco.  I am in Iowa and he allowed my trailer to stay on the lot at the auction, until I could pick it up with no problems.  Thanks guys.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy from you again.</review>

<review>It is a good place to find a used car or truck. Plan to spend sometime there. Go Friday and find what you want, go in person the internet wont or can't show you everything. If you get a car or truck buy the 72 hour return they have for about $ 100.00 or so . Get the car checked out asap.
You can get a good car there for about $2000.00 put about $700.00 to $1000.00  in it a drive it for 50000 to 100000 mi. with no damn car payments. But you must to put in the time and effort, two or three hours on Friday, 1/2 day on Saturday and the time to have it checked out the rest of the week end.
If you don't want to go through that then forget it and stay home.</review>< pics>

I was told that I owed 100$ in addition to my deposit. I became suspicious when I noticed the clerk printing many receipts and throwing away a paper i signed when i ask what she just threw away she said "nothing important". After arguing for about a  minute and I insisted on seeing what she threw away she takes out the receipt I just signed.  After reading it I found that the receipt stated that I WAS OWED 100  she immediately started to act surprised and  polite trying to laugh off her "mistake". When I picked up the lot I noticed many items were missing. I remember seeing the same type of tool box that was in my lot behind the clerk. I cant say it was from my lot but i know I left with no boxes</Text>

I was at the March 2013 auction and got a great deal.  I have been at city auctions, which you basically bid on cars that you dont know what you are getting to.  On these auctions you have to buy very low, because you will need extra cash for repairs or maybe not if you get very lucky.  This past March it was my first time at General Auction, and the bidding here is different.  You are pretty much bidding on cars that in great conditions and smog certified prior to putting them at the auction.

Just remember that you are not bidding on at city auction, these cars or at least most of them are in very good conditions.  Otherwise you are told about them.

The vehicles that are for dealers or dismantlers are vehicles that have been in very serious accidents or require mechanical or body repairs.  You can find those type of cars at city auctions, if you want to go through the hassle of reparing.

My props for their staff.  I had a minor issue and gave them a call explaining them my issue.  They asked me to come in to review and discuss the issue further.  I came in the following day and spoke with the General manager, a great guy.  He doesnt BS you, he tells you how it is and offer to help you out.  They dont just take your money and look the other way, if any issues they are willing to help you resolve it.  Long story short my issue was resolved.

How great of a deal was the car I bought:

The vehicle I bought had LOTTTTS of miles on it, and I was able to sell it within 7 days and made good profit.  Everything in this car was almost new.  The buyer was a mechanic and knew right away that he was getting a steal from me.

I guess I got a steal from General Auction.

See you guys in April!!!!!!<//review>

<text>Place sucks, they sell pallets of junk for $20-$50 in between the cars and it takes hours before they get done. They say the auction starts at 10 but they don't actually start till almost 11. WASTE of time going there to sit around.</text>< Pictures>

Disgraceful. I would give it a zero if possible. I have had an account since 1999 with Pensco. This is a new level of non service and a complete disregard of any responsibility in servicing my financial affairs.

I have called the contact number and spoken to 2 people who told me that they have no idea how the trust department operates. I have emailed numerous times and receive no reply at all.  Pacific should nit be allowed to handle anyone’s business or finance matters.< /Text>

I have been trying, without success, to get my account closed since last November.  Inasmuch as there is $.01 in my account there seems to be no clear way to get the account closed.  I was on hold again for 38 minutes this afternoon to reach a 'customer service' representative.  All she did was message a 'supervisor' back and forth with my issue which of course led to no resolution.  I received a reference number from my last call on 4/28, she confirmed no action has been taken.  I have messaged customer service through the website-no response.  If I could I would give a 0 star rating to this unresponsive and inefficient institution.  It is my hope that this will trigger a response from them.<//Review>

<Text>Terrible customer service.  PENSCO was already swirling the toilet bowl when they began cutting personnel in an obvious attempt to boost profit margins and attract a higher takeover bid.  It certainly worked but customers bore the pain of it, service has gotten meaningfully worse under Pacific Premier Trust.  They leave voicemails, emails even letters about account issues but when you respond, it's crickets until the next mindless communication.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80858062f5233729:0xcf19cd91fd18ddfe</gmapID></record>

They were always very responsive and helpful.

However, i was disappointed at the delays in handling my check, and the lack of information provided by the system. The check was delivered at 10 am on 11/17. The next day, it was paid by the bank from which it was drawn. For two days, i checked the PPT website, but found no evidence of its existence in my account.

I wondered if somehow the check was cashed by someone else, not PPT for my account. This would have meant a huge headache, and the potential loss of $361K. I contacted Elias, who confirmed that it had been received. Finally, today, Friday, i received an email from PPT that said it was in my account.

There should not have been such a delay in reporting the receipt of the check and the deposit into my account. The system should be more efficient and timely. Whereas i am happy with the people with whom i've worked, i am concerned about the lack of communication from PPT about this check.

<review>The transfer went fine but the investment that the transfer was intended to fund was rejected necessitating my having to initiate a return transfer to the original source.  PENSCO should have been more proactive in reviewing the proposed investment before pushing for the transfer.  Had they been either more responsive or communicative with me during the review process this wouldn't have been the case.  Bottom Line:  A total waste of time and money.< /review>< Pictures>

This company holds on to your money and charges outrageous money to simply hold it in a money market fund. BTW, on $80,000 I made .16 CENTS interest. Somebody on the board is getting rich.
I should have done my research before putting my money here.
One month after I request a change of custodian I got my money back. They do not participate in electronic transfers from other investment firms. They will hold onto your money as long as they possible can.

Customer service was also rude, I wish I could attach my email to this review and you would understand.

Plenty other people will take my money, bye bye Pensco.< /Text>

< Review>
I had a very complicated asset transfer involving publicly traded foreign securities with warrants in my Roth IRA from another custodian to PENSCO.  Gordon Pisciotta took charge of this process for PENSCO and did an outstanding job, keeping me fully informed each step of the way.

Unfortunately, it's rare to see the level of skill and commitment that Gordon demonstrated from the staff of financial institutions, and his performance is to be commended.  It's the everyday actions of employees like Gordon that make the difference in the reputations of financial institutions.  His actions are what keeps me a loyal client of PENSCO, and causes me to consistently recommend PENSCO to others for the services it performs.

By the way, the assets were at the other custodian in the first place because PENSCO wouldn't take them. It was a a private placement of foreign securities with warrants. The private securities eventually became publicly traded ADR's, and when the warrants expired, PENSCO was able to execute the transfer.<//Review>

<name>Mr Bill< /name><Time>1565793122516< /Time><rating>5</rating><Text>I spent a week asking friends for referrals to a self directed IRA company as well as many hours online checking reviews.
The fees were an important issue but being able to reach someone directly without going through 15 minutes of phone prompts was equally important.

Alaine Garcia's name came up several times while checking out Pensco on several different review sites. Everyone was in love with the service this woman provided. So I tried to reach her twice. My call was returned by Jack both times until he realized that I wasn't going to make a decision  until I spoke with Alaine. He finally conferenced her in to the call.

It is a pleasure dealing with another professional who actually answers her phone, returns calls in a timely manner and if she doesn't know the answer to a question, she quickly uses the company resource to find an answer. She understands service!

I just closed my fist investment with Pensco and Aron Powell and Alaine are spectacular assets to your company. I can only hope the people in charge actually read these reviews and recognize Alaine and Aron for their professionalism.

In a world where people don't speak to one another anymore and service exists in such few places, I feel fortunate to have found Alaine, Aron and Pensco to help me with my future investments.

I am happy to refer you to anyone needing professional IRA information to Pensco Co.

Respectfully,

The sales process was great.  The delivery process has been awful.  I have a couple of simple questions to be answered, and calling the help line leaves you in this maddening cycle of a horrible jingle repeated every 30 seconds or so and a recording saying PENSCO knows how important my time is and will be with me "shortly."    I guess "shortly" means within the year sometime, because I have yet to speak with anyone other than the recording.   PENSCO is a company great on concept and inept on delivery.   They charge high fees, but don't invest those fees in the people needed to service the customers.<//Text>

I was initially concerned that the process of communicating expense payment requests and supporting files would result in delayed payment to the vendor. Pensco has been very quick on the turnaround and my vendors have no problem with being paid through Pensco. Other issues I have had have been dealt with very quickly as well        Very satisfied.</Text>

I contacted Pensco with the goal of purchasing a short term rental in my IRA with Pensco as the custodian.  Mr. Theodore Marks was my contact.  After speaking with Mr. Marks and establishing a path forward it was my intent to open an account with Pensco, to fund the account only after the offer to purchase was accepted, transfer my RBC IRA account after liquidating it to cash.  That is not what happened.  Mr. Marks walked me thru the account opening process in which Mr. Marks had me transfer my RBC assets 'in-kind', some cash mostly stocks. I was not aware he was doing this and was not what we had discussed when I asked immediately what was happening Mr. Marks replied 'don't worry we will transfer it back at no charge'.  It was 7 days before I could access my funds and unfortunately it was Dec 5-13 when the market down turn lowered the value of my funds below the amount needed to fund the real estate purchase.  Now I have an Self Directed IRA holding stocks mainly which was never my intent, I don't have the knowledge to manage that type of account.  I am having trouble liquidating my account to cash in an effort to find another short term rental to purchase and I am losing funds, as we all are in this market, so fast with no help or support from Pensco.  I do not recommend this company and I am trying to salvage my portfolio, my life savings, over this holiday period.  This has been a nightmare.  I do not recommend this company, run away fast and far.<//text>

They held on to my money as long as they possibly could, and even Fidelity was frustrated with there lack of caring about transferring my money out (not to mention wait times on the phone). NEVER
AGAIN.
*Update: Their user interface is so bad it’s not compatible with Safari if you want to download any of your statements/documents.

The Pensco client service representative was able to inform me of a recent change made by several big banks concerning paying my Pensco transaction fees with my bank credit card.  I wasn't aware of this recent change on the part of this group of big banks.  The client service representative suggested other ways I can pay the Pensco transaction fees to avoid these bank charges and I took action on one those suggestions.< /Review>

< review>
I have been doing business with PENSCO Trust Company for a few years and I am ready to go to a more friendly customer support trust company.

It has been very discouraging dealing with these folks when buying and selling real estate with my ROTH IRA.

On one transaction, they overpaid the escrow amount by the original deposit and I was told by one of their Customer Service Representatives (CSR) that I had to get back the overpayment.

One CSR told me to use one name and a second CSR told me to use a different name for a different transaction. No consistency within its own people.

The CSR would not allow me to talk to his/her supervisor when I question something they want me to do; AND ITS MY MONEY! It’s like they have a power trip about their position or job title.

The customer support let’s a lot to desidered from these folks.

DO NOT USE THEM!!!!!!!!! I will discourage any contacts that I know from using PENSCO. I am glad there are other companies doing this type of work out there!

Sincerely,

Carlos< /review>

<Time>1505826366861<//Time><Text>I am an attorney and work with Pensco's non-traditional IRA services group on a regular basis on behalf of my clients.  I have found their customer service to be consistently strong, which is especially impressive given the volume of paperwork and uniqueness of the issues that arise on a case by case basis.  In particular, the service provided by the real estate group and Matt White's team has been exceptional.  I would highly recommend Pensco to people looking for a custodian for non-traditional IRAs.  Pensco delivers solid results in a challenging arena.

Fees are outrageous.  They had our credit card and charged us more than we received in dividends.  To make it worse, they didn't charge our credit card, they took a "DRAW" in order to get their fee a day early, and then the credit card co. charged us $5.00 for the draw and 24% interest.  That's twice per month for my wife and I. Go figure.<//review>

Cheapest SubWay I have ever seen in my entire life. Don’t recommend this place at all go somewhere else if you want something good, bigger, clean, and the way you want your Subway.<//text>

Nice, quick, and healthy food anytime. The server was really nice, changed gloves, and made a great sandwich. I tried cheese garlic veggie delight for the first time. He put a lot of veggies and extra pickles and jalapeños on request. Hope subway can introduce new flavors and fillings soon!< /review>

Service is not upto the mark. Giving 3 Star rating for the convenient location ONLY. They need to improve their service and treat customers with respect as they refused to change their gloves when we requested< /review>

----------------------------------------------

Presented a coupon with an expiration date of May 15 and the worker told me I could not use the coupon and printed to the date but today is May 7.

This is a good subway overall.The meat and vegetables and other items look pretty fresh. The place is clean. Service okay usually.</Text></record>

<Review>A worst subway ever.. service was awful, and they made sandwich with awful veggies. I've never left a comments entire my life. This is the first comment I left, and it's because I don't want to any people have a same experience with me. Trust me, this is going to be the worst subway...< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Delicious Subway, the service is standard Subway service, somewhat rushed, but understandable. I used to work at Subway so I know how crazy the flow can be. Great price and great tasting sandwiches though so can't complain!< /text>

<review>really not into their whole act, the servers aren't mean but arent totally personable.  Also the food there is just not very good, there are plenty of delis around that you can get actually fresh foods on your sandy for about the same price.  last time i went they put a sauce on my sandy that was more just like water and it was super soggy.  im done with this place< /review></record></dataset><record>

On 4-11-19 I stopped in for 2 combos for 11.99 special coupon on the mobile app. Attendee behind the counter didn't know how to enter the code and charged me full price. Please be clear before you order.< /Text>

The staff here are professional, friendly and a joy to work with!  Abe (the only guy with a beard) remembered me from a prior visit and Christine is awesome, fun to work with as well as professional. Keep up the good work!! Very nice, convenient and clean location.<//Review>

<Review>I appreciate the precautions they've out in place. Theres a registration/check in process. You then have to wait to be called in. Someone opens the door for you and then you go to whomever you need to see. Definitely not a lot of people in the office at the same time so that was good  overall a great experience!< /Review><username>Anna Beltran</username><rating>5<//rating><pics>None</pics><GmapID>0x808fb555d251325d:0x86c68f53df6eb318< /GmapID>< UserId.>

<review>This is a good branch. Very good.
Unfortunately, it only takes one bad apple to blemish a perfect score. There is one lady (cant remember her name) who does not meet the standard. unless that standard is disgruntled DMV worker.
THANKFULLY I haven't not had her very often. I don't even see her that often. Perhaps she is only there to fill in sometimes. I would say to the branch, don't call her in the future. lol

Other than that, this location would be perfect<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1591879036694, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent experience with us, Andrew.

<review>Wow, I was dreading walking into a AAA office thinking they are going to try to upsell me and let's face it, the office doesn't seem like a fun place to visit.

I walked in and was greeted by the front guy which was the nicest guy ever.  Sorry, didn't catch the name, but blonde long hair stylish guy.  He took care of my IDP in 5 mins and I was on my way to pay.  Awesome!  Thank you!

Plenty of parking, fast and friendly service, nothing to complain about.< /review>< pictures>

Worst experience for pay DMV REGISTRATION FEE.  Not recommended office and services. The cashier and the front desk is impolite and rude. They will make fun of you if you are not member,  and not offer you to join the membership. No base customer service knowledges. They were broken a 15+ years memberships relationship by the rude customer service in 5minutes. Out there, a lot of tow service and unlock option less than $100. $100 I would rather pay Amazon or Costco membership,  you will get lot more CS and rewards.</Text>

!!!TRUCKERS!!! If you have an 8 am appointment and are not a drayage driver, do not attempt to check in early. The guard shack will make you backup onto the street and wait until exactly 8 to check you in. Just park on the street and wait. Also, another driver said this was a tight backup spot.. it’s not. If you cannot put your trailer into the hole at this warehouse without breaking a sweat, you should probably look for another profession. I’d hate to see what happens when you have less space to work with.
Lastly, they floor load trailers. Minimum 2-3 hour load time. Warehouse workers are nice and try to get you out as quickly as they can.

Keep that head on a swivel and be safe out there guys.< /Text>

<Text>I lived near by so I paid a visit in person for a warranty exchange. My broken one was a discontinued luggage so the company said they were going to give me something similar. The replacement piece turned out to be a pleasant surprise! It felt like an upgrade from my previous piece!< /Text>< Response>

<text>I used my luggage for the first time and one of the wheels broke. Even though the product says it has a 3year warranty, they said that they would not cover it. I have been calling since and they won’t answer or return my call.< /text>< username>

Very professional and work quickly to get you loaded. 2.5 hours to load a floor load from top to bottom and length of the trailer isn't a bad time. And I didn't have to touch any of it.< /Text>

<Text>I have been waiting for over thirty days to get a replacement for a piece of junk luggage that cracked the very first time I used it.  I have gotten nothing but a run around: multiple requests for the same information, more photos of the same piece of luggage from every conceivable angle, info from tags inside the luggage, info from the receipt, multiple copies of the receipt.  I've finally decided to go to the Attorney General with my complaint.  This is not a reputable company.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>They don't stand behind their products! I purchased 3 hydration backpacks with an Olivet hydration pack in it from Sam's, 2 of which had leaking hydration packs (the backpack itself was made by Coleman, but the hydration pack inside was made by Olivet). Long story short, after emailing with Olivet and waiting 2 weeks for another reply, I finally emailed them back and was told to just return the defective product to Sam's. There are several problems with this: 1. It had been WEEKS since I started emailing Olivet and Sam's ran out of backpacks by then so I couldn't just return mine and get new ones; I'm out 2 hydration backpacks for my kids now. 2. I was told they were forwarding my email to someone, but 2 weeks later, I had to email them to get a response (that's not good customer service). 3. The defective products are Olivet's responsibility because they manufactured it, not Sam's Club's responsibility, but they just want Sam's to take responsibility for it.

The only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the person I emailed with was friendly. But I will not do business with them again because they don't take responsibility for their defective products. There are many things they could've done to make me happy (ex. send me new hydration packs, send me a free product if packs are not available, send me a high value coupon, etc.), but they did none of it. If you think a company should stand behind their products and take care of customers who purchase defective products, then DON'T by any of Olivet's products/brands.</Text>< user_name>

They sell REVO luggages, very bad quality of products. I bought a suitcase the day after the purchase the wheels were blocked. No news from customer service after email. Total rip off and dishonest company.</review>

They scanned my foot, recorded my gait on the treadmill. Selected the best shoe for me. Prices are just as good as online maybe even better. And you get a personal service on top of that. It's a win-win win. Definitely come here again and support local business!! Good job on a business well run</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Been running for over 40 years.  Recently bought 2 pairs of running shoes from the Mission Viejo Snail's Pace Running Store.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I told them the shoe characteristics I was looking for and they gave me their recommendations.  I have been entirely happy with both pairs of shoes.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>My husband took me to Snails Pace to gift me a pair of running shoes for Thanksgiving, as I recently started running everyday. I can’t begin to tell you how fabulous my experience was. The store is amazing and the staff is super helpful, especially Scott. He was patient with me to not only understand my running style but also suggested shoes that would give me the extra support around my ankles. He even taught me an unique way of tying my laces just so that the ankles get the support around them. I tried 7-8 pairs of shoes before zeroing down on my first pair of Brooks. I’d like to thank Scott and the entire team of Snails Pace for making such a basic experience of buying sports shoes, memorable.<//Review>< GmapID>

After purchasing a few pairs of running shoes through COVID that did not fit right, led to blisters and weeks off of running, it was so nice to return to a brick-and-mortar store with professionals who took the time to assess my feet, gait and shoe fit.  I 100% recommend Snail's Pace and look forward to the running club's return!<//Text>

<Review>I sincerely appreciate the personalized service provided at this store. Have purchased multiple walking/running shoes from them over the past 15 years, and without fail, the service has alwsys been exceptional. They have a wide variety of athletic shoe options, as well as a small selection of athletic clothes. Highly recommend this store.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1595030315739, 'text': 'Thank you so much Jacky! That makes out day! Stay safe.'}<//Response>< user_id>

<text>Went there with my son to check out their inserts for flat feet as diagnosed by his doctor & podiatrist.  Unfortunately the prescription orthotics were not covered so we had to find something over the counter, to which your employee Alex helped us immensely.  He was very informative, told us the difference between the brands, the importance of lacing technique, what might be best for our shoe & sport type (our son runs and also does racquet sports) and was very patient & profession with our son, without any sales pushiness.  THANKS SNAIL'S PACE AND ALEX SPECIFICALLY!</text><Name>wonder the wu<//Name>< GmapID>

<text>Shane helps us both find the right shoe for us. He brought out 6 pairs for each of us to try on. He began my scanning our feet then video recording our feet to show us exactly how we were running. Very high tech and helpful.

2018 & 2019. Bought shoes from them again in late 2017 and they were spot on with the comfort and fitting. I plan on going again this weekend for a new 2019 pair.

<Text>The guys and girls at Snails Pace have been great, providing expert information on running shoes for my clients at Bauer Physical Therapy.
They will sit down with you and find the right fit whether you are a hardcore runner or just need a good shoe to walk and exercise.
Give them a visit the next time you need athletic shoes.

Took my brother's dog in to get her a size 1soccer ball.  This was the only store in Modesto that had it.  Was glad they let me bring her inside, and she was happy, too!< /Text>

<review>Worst store ever. Very big mess inside store. No logic in products displaying. Empty shelfs. Toys in the wrong places everywhere. MY cashier was very slow and rude. You need to do something with management in this store , to fix all this problems.</review><rate>1< /rate><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>114714678126180705947< /UserId.><date>1482304281159<//date></record>

<review>Kind of a depressing feeling inside, some workers seem to enjoy the job, others seem like they can’t believe they work at a toys r us. As far as the toys are concerned, selection is great, especially if your use to doing your toy shopping at like a target or something, I enjoy coming here every now and again to remember all the good times I had as a child inside, never really crowded if you go on a normal day. Of course that changes around Holiday season.< /review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

A great place to shop for almost any toy. It's easy to find pretty much anything there because the isles are so clearly organized. We went at the end of the night so it was quite messy and decently busy.<//text>

It's not just going shopping, it's an event.. experience unmatched. That's my two cents. Still plenty on the shelves. Some discounts to be found. Popular items are about gone or going fast tho.

I'm VERY SAD to see Toys"R"Us go out of business... 😔 I have been shopping there for 30 plus years, ALL the MEMORIES 😆 holidays and birthdays will not be the same!! Thank you to EVERYONE that helped me over the years create wonderful memories!!! I hope that you all have found employment to take the place of this closure.< /Text>

Store was in disarray, no employees to help. To be expected as it is going out of business I guess. Most general stuff was 40% off. I went in for PS4 games which were only 10%. Internet still has better prices even as they are closing their doors. Too bad...<//Review>

I love taking my son here it's clean it's a nice store some of the staff is not the best but other than that this really is a nice store. And they actually have what my son wants. And it's made with good quality so it last long because he's three and you know how small children are with toys their rough and he loves tractors and Toys R Us has lot of outdoor tractors in their store which my son loves cuz then he can actually pick the toy out rather than just having to go to the store and just buy what's there. And when stuff goes on sale they're really good prices for the quality of the toy or clothes or diapers whatever you buy.</Text>

I always appreciate how clean and organized the store is. Staff was very helpful when i asked where to find a specific toy. I would like to see their prices become more competetive however.</Review>

An employee was greeting customers and offering help. The swimming pool I was looking for was in stock as I was told when calling ahead. The checkout process was quick and  some shade in the parking lot.< /text>

This store is closing. Most of the merchandise is picked over and cannot be returned for any reason. If their prices had always been as reasonable as they are now, they might not have had to close their doors.<//review>

I love Toys R US and giving  it a 4 only because it holds such great memories. Going here as a child was like a right of  passage! It's a giant toy store. It was like my dreams came true. However as a paying adult,  every toy is overpriced and you can get the exact same toy either online or at walmart/target cheaper. I can see why they're going out of business. Sad. But foreseeable.< /text>

<text>I primarily only go here during holiday season, but the store is always a disaster zone. Went the other night and there were no carts inside the store waiting for incoming customers. People were literally going back out into the rain to search for carts themselves. I chose to carry my daughter instead. Thankfully I only need to go here once a year.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I am aware that the store is closing, but the restrooms were disgusting with basically no toilet paper or working soap dispensers. I watched a mom walk in after my daughter used the last few shreds of toilet paper we could find, and she was as surprised as I was about the horrible condition the bathroom was in. Like 10 empty Tp rolls all over the stall floors showed how long this had been that way. It was truly disgusting!!!< /review><Time>1523053974088<//Time><UserId.>100313709330724463558< /UserId.>< Pics>

SOOOO SAD they're going out of business! Prices are too high. Maybe that's why--can't compete with Target and Wal-Mart (and all of the online sites to buy toys), but there's nothing like going to Toys-R-Us for a child. It's magical, and worth the few extra bucks. We went 3 days ago, and the whole store was 10-30% off (mostly 10% off) which made the cost of our purchase almost comparable to the competitors. I'll be bringing my daughter a couple times a week until they're closed. They're the only toy store that has their mascot (Geoffrey the Giraffe) call children on their birthday with happy birthday wishes & send a $3 birthday card/coupon. We will miss Toys-R-Us. When I was growing up, it was THE place to get your first bike, your Barbies, and Cabbage Patch dolls. I guess kids get their bikes at Wal-Mart now. It's a shame. There's no more large toy stores--retail stores just for kids--anymore. Sad. Growing up, there were toy stores in malls too. I guess the online generation will get their toys online now too...I think it sucks.</Text>

This place has the options just not the price point that is comparable in the market. So if you are expecting HUGE savings... wait longer.<//Review></record>

It is sad that Toys "R" Us will be closing but “There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.” (Ecclesiastes 3:1)

I hope a new business moves in there real soon: something fun, something kids will enjoy, and something to give people new jobs.< /text>

Now though, if you find a Toys"R"Us, it's going bankrupt. If you walk in, all that'll be on the shelves are the unwanted toys from 6 years ago, along with some batteries that you can't use.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>I remember a time when I could walk in there and their game selection was descent and it wasn't the first place people went for new releases.Now its  barren wasteland of unorganized games and the employees don't even know what they are doing or knowledgeable to help you look for a game.Also please fix your floors, and your on average selling trading cards 5$ more than everywhere else.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>If you care about the clean safety of your children don't bring them here and if you do happen to be here check your bought boxes for bugs. Some young employees are clueless as if they are drugged heavily leaving messy packages and boxes on floors with no cleaning. There were sightings of cockaroaches on the floors it wasn't really s shocker since their Garbage bins outside are dirty with food spilling on the concrete...</Review>< pictures>

Went Christmas shopping here and boy it was packed lol all the parents, unclear, aunties, and grandparents were all shopping last minute lol it was pretty crowded and lots of foot traffic everywhere in the store but overall they have plenty of toys and a variety of brands. I was able to find many of the toys that were in my children's Christmas list. Lol, if only they knew that Santa was really their father.</Review>

<review>Store was very dirty and not well stocked. Not organized well either. Tons of people in store hard to walk through them all. Hardly any staff around to help. If I could give no stars I would.< /review><user_id>117101599582913775746</user_id>< Response>

Was in there a day after Christmas to return a broken toy that my son received for Christmas. The store had poor customer service and we were unable to get what my son wanted. We were forced to return on a different day because we didn't have the proper receipt. With the capabilities of technology nowadays they should have been able to pull up the information they needed in their system but were unable to do so.</Text>

They do have a big variety of toys which is what you're looking for in a place like this but the store itself looks like second rate it's kind of raggedy and poorly organized it looks very cluttery it's designed to be like a maze where you have to go by almost every department just to find what you are looking for but the shelves are stacked so high you can't look above them to kind of guide yourself so you could get lost if you're not familiar, I just hate that in a store I have enough things to worry about in my day to be planning an exit strategy, and the employees are like depressed or something almost as if they make minimum wage or don't want to be there and that rubs off on you it's like that downer energy is contagious and there's no music or nothing playing in the speakers making things even worse. Idk I guess if I had to sum it up on one sentence it would be "it feels like that store is dying" and all the employees are just waiting for the store to close down so they can go on unemployment 😔< /text>

Employees seemed like they did not want to help me in recieving my order, i had to wait for a little bit while there was only a handful of peoole in the store. They seemed as though they cared more about there conversations with each other than helping customers.</review>

What a trash dump.  Nothing is in the right places.  Nothing is recovered to have any semblance of order.  Mismarked shelves and empty aisles make me think they don't want to sell anything.  I counted no less than 30 baskets worth of merchandize parked all over the store and blocking check stands and other merchandize.  The store manager appears to have given up as the employees just stand around and talk amongst themselves.  If I was corporate I'd have this place shut down and demolished.  It would save their reputation more than leaving it as is.<//review>

Helpful when needed good customer service but follow ppl around as if they're stealing when they're not to an almost harassing point, very embarrassing especially when it's clearly and obviously noticable</review>

<review>I know it's a toy store, but this store is always messy and unorganized.  Not enough employees to help you when you have questions. On the other hand, there's a huge selection of different toys for any age!<//review>< rating>

Sadly, my last three trips there I have left empty handed. The selection is terrible and poorly organized. I can't imagine that this store will be around much longer.</review>

10 percent off for a going out of business sale. The place was gross. Filthy and smelled like dirty diapers with toys on the ground everywhere. Had to ditch the cart because I couldn't get it through half the aisles.</Text>

This place never looks clean. Every time I walk in the shelves are bare or very messy. The toys are on the floor. There is trash on the floor of on the shelves. Hard to find what I'm looking for as nothing is very organized.<//Text>
