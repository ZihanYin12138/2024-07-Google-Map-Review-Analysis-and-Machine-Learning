I ordered two fires and one shack burger. Fresh as always and even there was a long line, they gave out food fast. The gentleman helped me today gave excellent customer service and he was always care about if people are waiting too long to get their food. I asked his name and I believe is Dennis. If I got it wrong, please correct me. But anyway, I will definitely stop by again especially if he will serve my order! So much joy and fun! Highly recommended!</text>< Pics>

Try the Chicken Shack if you haven't already - it's as good (if not better?) than the classic cheeseburger.
Great outdoor dining area and fast service. A+</text>

The shake Shack deep fried cheese stuffed veggie burger is always good.

This particular location is INSIDE of the mall’s food court (to my surprise).

My main issue was the long wait for an online order, significantly past the eta and then the cold fries I received.</text>

<Text>I don’t know about you but I don’t want raw meat from a fast food place. Nasty!!! I didn’t eat my burger. I saw my food sitting on the counter for ten minutes before they gave it to me and the bread was mush. The whipped cream on my milkshake was literally flat. It’s over priced and the burgers are tiny. This place is just awful.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPUrGwN-5UWji4vFb5WTdxkqTxvfEC2w7Klfsn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Ok, to be clear my issue was NOT in any way the fault of s.s. It was the app I was using. But it was a big mix up and s.s. fixed it for me even though they didn't have to. And the manager was super nice about it. He was absolutely kind. He went out of his way to help me. I would absolutely recommend s.s. to anyone and would not hesitate to eat here anytime!<//review>

<text>Things haven’t changed at this Shake Shack, since it’s Grand Opening; things continue to be very disorganized. Pre-ordered, arrived 5-min prior to pick-up time, received ‘Order Ready’ text 10-min late, waited a further 5min, before I had to chase the order, only to find they ‘forgot’ to call it. Milkshakes had turned to liquid and this is what my grilled cheese should have looked like vs. what we got...an utter waste of time and money</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9QeRfJblGsjUdU1wP835x58tS4uHXQ4rblyPX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-KaPAmmdYyM6xwvzW5Giy2SK4S9zEbAdzWBA3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1604352035301, 'text': "William, Thank you for your feedback.

I ordered online pickup and my pickup just kept getting delayed, about 45 minutes after my initial pick up time it was ready. I go home after getting my food to find literally everything was cold, my cheese fries were cold and the cheese had crusted over and developed a thick film so they’d obviously been sitting out for a while. The fries and burgers were cold to the touch and the food was just gross. I got the regular cheese burger and added bacon but it just had this nasty flavor too it, it was so bad I couldn’t even get half way through it. Overall this restaurant is a hard pass</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I work in the mall and have eaten as this location several times. It's the perfect spot for a burger if you want higher quality than McDonald's but cheaper than Buckhorn. I've worked in food service and know how difficult it is to iron out the initial kinks and get things off the ground. With this location being brand new to the area, they are often slammed with in person and mobile orders, as well as delivery courier orders. But every time I'm there while it's overwhelmingly busy I see how hard the employees are working to do the best the can, the fastest they can.

My overall review lost a star simply because special orders often get overlooked. I usually add vegetables to my Smoke Shack burger and I love getting the chocolate/vanilla shake- but almost every time I'm given just a chocolate shake and often the vegetables are left off. Not a huge deal as there is no up charge for adding on extras. But it would still be nice to get what I order. If I'm observing correctly it looks like some of the shakes are pre made, presumably to save time- but full transparency goes a long way with customers. If there's no time to give me the chocolate/vanilla option, just let me know!

Overall, besides the obvious hiccups that come with a brand new store, I  am happy to continue eating here!  Hoping they continue to grow and fall into a consistent rhythm. I have high hopes! They seem to hire hard workers, and a location is only as good as it's employees.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1605442508156, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The unfortunate thing is that the food was amazing....
It was unfortunate because we received (only 3 burgers) from our total order which was (4 burgers, 1 grill cheese, 2 fries, 1 cheese fries, 10 piece chicken bites), and you might say its an honest mistake? The problem we have though is not that our food was missing, but more so there was NO solutions to help us with the mistake... Shake Shack has NO real-time way for a customer to contact a manager for help (Their phone number refers you to their website OR you can leave a voicemail) and it says a manager will call you back within 24hrs???  I just left a voicemail with my number but not expecting anything to come from it, honestly, theres little value in a call back "tomorrow" about our order error "tonight". Anyhow, we ordered dinner elsewhere, only leaving feedback because the food at Shake Shake was amazing, it'd be a real shame to have food THAT GREAT yet lose customers due to terrible process/customer service solutions.   Wish you the best.<//text>

We went on the grand opening,  kind of a disaster....it took forever to get our food our order was wrong and I watched an employee walk around dwith my milkshake in her hand for a good 10 minutes insuring it was good and melted when I got it. The burger was sweaty and soggy, actually had pretty good flavor. I will try again when they know what their doing but rather pricey for a burger place 27.00 for 2 people, 2 burgers 1 fry 1 milkshake.<//review>

<text>Long wait for below average food. This was definitely not worth the wait. My Shack burger tasted like a Wendy’s cheeseburger. We also got a spicy chicken sandwich. Guess what that tasted like? Chick-Fil-A! The only thing that resembled other Shake Shacks was the mushroom burger my wife ordered. So disappointing.

We ordered 5 items and 2 were wrong. We ordered cheese fries but they came out with no cheese. We also ordered a Diet Coke but we got a Cherry Coke instead. What the!?! How hard is it to assemble fast food?

We love the Shake Shack in Las Vegas and we were so excited when one opened up here in Roseville but sadly it’s just not the same.

I’d eat here again but definitely wouldn’t go out of my way for it.

A solid 2/5!<//text>< pics>

Sooooooo not worth what I was charged. Bougie price point & small proportions. Hardly a meal to satiate one's hunger. Avoid this place if you want a real cheeseburger.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1604351499724, 'text': "Lacie, Thanks so much for your feedback.

Wow. Paid nearly $20 for a burger the size of a single slider, fries and a drink. Best to look elsewhere.</text>

<text>Shake shack is a must go to place when your at the mall. Buns are nice and oily, the meat is very juicy, and the toppings make it even better. A very quality burger, but very expensive.< /text>< pictures>

Wish I had known about this location sooner! They have a great selection, lots of daily deals. The people are nice and knowledgeable, and care about your experience. Best of all this place doesn't have the heavy bro vibe of some other local places. Thank you for not making your female employees wear tiny tank tops!< /text>

I ordered weed. Placed the order at 630pm. Driver arrived at 8 p.m. Without my weed. Leaves never hear back from them. I recommend you look elsewhere if you want weed. You might not get it. Disappointed.<//Review>

I have been in terrible pain for a long time from a car accident. Nothing worked anymore (pills, injections) so I thought to try an alternative. Ryan was SO much help and knew how every product would or would not work for me. I had such a great experience I went back today & saw Ryan again. He is so knowledgeable. Last time I got gummys & disposables and today I got tincture which worked so fast! Thanks Ryan!</Review>

Half oz specials are where this place got my attention. Some staff can be pretty rude or dry got that vibe on my first visit from someone who turned out to be a manager. Since then I have come across other staff that honestly do go above and beyond to get me to spend my money on more then just a half oz special. Over all ok shop in a kind of sketch part of downtown but security is always out and about letting their presence be known i have never felt unsafe<//text>

This is the best in hookah, variety and food taste and great service specially by the very attractive, attentive and active server girl named Pearl and the wonderful Sherif, the guy who makes sure you are enjoying your hookah to the most.<//review><rating>3</rating>< Date>

This place is amazing! They carry several high end cannabis brands and a huge array of products (edibles,  concentrates, vapes, beverages,  accessories,  gear, etc. The prices are reasonable and the location easy to access to and from the 10 fwy. The staff is friendly and very  knowledgeable. Thumbs up!!</Text>

<Text>Disappointed abt this store saw amazing reviews abt it and saw it closes at 8. After we went to universal at 6:45 we pull up and I run it to be told In Spanish it’s closed. I said I didn’t understand twice and worker was a bit rude trying to keep me away. How abt y’all first say 6:30 on sundays or something bc it said 8 pm close. Saw amazing jerseys in there and would of paid for them but rude worker< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
An absolute gem in downtown Los Angeles. You would never know about this place unless you were part of the soccer Community I'm downtown LA. Incredibly warm and helpful staff, everything you need to equip a soccer team, all of the cold spray, bomb, bandages you need to keep players on the field and everything you need to outfit a team. These guys are incredible<//Review>

<Text>I first came to RB Day Spa In early 2019 and was very happy & satisfied with the service that was provided. Management are very professional and friendly as well as the staff. Now in 2021 I am back with RB 😁 Now in a new building a more spacious and very clean modern office. I was able to get seen due to someone else canceling. What a blessing and what a relief it was. Much needed lymphatic massage. I met Georgina for the first time and what an excellent job she did. I left extremely happy & feeling better. I highly recommend RB Day Spa. No one can beat their prices. 💯 SATISFIED</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I have to share the love..... this is where I go to enjoy a 'Stay-cation". I go almost once a month and instantly feel refreshed internally and externally. Now back to the 'A' game.< /Text>

<Review>I began going there for relaxing massages then a facial here and there. I love the environment, it feels cozy, they make you feel at home and comfortable. Now after a tummy tuck they were my go too for lymphatic drainage massages. I always go to lily, shes the best of the best. Really experience, she knows what shes doing. Any concerns you have she will get things checked out for you and even make recommendations to the work you might need. Besides lymphatic massages with time come the machines, cavitation and radio frequency even body wraps. I luv her!!.So far I've gone to 16 sessions which is 2 packages. And when they have specials is very good deals they have an ig, follow them @rbdayspa.<//Review>< Pictures>

This little place is great. Great service for it being where it is at, however it feels like I'm on the Westside. Prices are great. The owner is really down to earth and staff are really professional.<//Review>

Its my 3rd time at Rb day spa in Lynwood, Ca but since the 1st vist they have been very attentive & accommodating to my needs. I recently had a tummy tuck, bbl, and breast lift and have been going for the lymphatic drainage massage which I must say is the best massage I've had by far...they provide amazing & reliving results. Rb day spa is literally is a one stop shop for all your needs from facials to specialty massages, teas to creams, fajas to booty seats..I love this place and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensiv, private environment, quality work, and customer friendly spa.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>The Latina worker Giselle tried to charge me $10.95 for a Teriyaki Chicken sandwich on Monday, footlong Teriyaki chicken day!  I asked for almost no Teriyaki sauce, since they separate the sauce and chicken to save $$ at this store.  She said Chicken is $11, put sauce on it, $6.  Would not give me MGR's phone number!  Crazy.  Avoid this place!!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

At best most locations are moderate level considering the increased cost of the sandwich’s !
This location on the other hand is operating at a high level of customer satisfaction . As a consumer I look for quality to price ,! First of all the location here is clean , the veggies and meat here are extremely fresh and neatly placed !
my sandwich was neatly put together ! Staff are friendly and professional !
Simply at this location you get what you pay for !! I give 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼!<//Review>< pics>

<review>i am extremely disappointed. i ordered on the app and didn’t get some of the things i wanted in my sub. then the second time i ordered subs for my parents and paid for turkey and black forest ham and only got the turkey in it. and they didn’t add the cheese either. it wasn’t toasted either so it wasn’t as good. i was very mad< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<text>Employees Bryan and Elizabeth were both very helpful and positive. This is what subway wants us to expect from their employees, and the general manager David Morales is definitely doing his best being a leader at subway. We haven't always had the best service in our area with subway but our minds have been changed today and we can't wait to go back. Watch out subway employees, Bryan and Elizabeth have set the bar and you should all be expected to act as they did!!</text>< Date>

The only reason I go here sometimes is because it's closer to my house and I'm in a rush. However, every time I go they don't have certain ingredients or certain bread, or their register is broken. And they don't bother to write it on a paper so at least people can see ahead of time. Also, the workers almost always seem like they don't want to be there.</text>

Very clean. They were out of veggie patties, so I can't rate the food. I stood there for about 8 minutes and the employee never acknowledge d me until it was my turn. I guess I use to being greeted as I walk in.< /Text>

I went there and ordered a burrito on 1/29/21 and when I was driving and started eating the food and the beans smelled like they were going bad. I had this food before and it was great 3 years ago but, very disappointed.</Review>

Excellent authentic Mexican food! They have tacos, tortas, burritos, and of course chips and salsa! This place is a nice little venue with a family oriented vibe. Its operrated by a sweet lady that Im assuming is the owner who also delivers the food to the table which is really nice of her. This place sticks out to me because they have good prices, great food and great service! One of the better family owned places in Anaheim.<//review>

Very good Mexican food. I usually like to taste restaurant's borritos and in my opinion I like these way more. I used to think de anda's were good. But you should definitely go check this place out.<//review>

(Translated by Google) THE NARANJITO. For my taste one of the best alternatives to eat RICO CLEAN AND AT REASONABLE PRICES.
Excellent service by the waiters, or their owner, very friendly and bilingual.
Fast service and for now only take out. Specialists in traditional Mexican food ... they also offer many SPECIALS every day of the week ..
Very familiar ... 😷😁😋😋👍

Good pizza, but every time I call, the price either changes or the worker doesn’t know how to compute the specials. They either have to ask someone or they give up all together and I have to settle for what they know how to do. I’ll continue to get pizza there but it’s super frustrating.</Review>

Update 2/21:  To get the deal, click on the special tab on Papa Johns website.  You get a large two toppings for $9.99.  If you use TMobile Tuesday App for 25% off with code TMT25, you can get it for $7.49.  I guess you really got to read the fine print and navigate around.

-----------------

Papa Johns and T-Mobile team up to mislead consumers on their deals.  The T-Mobile Tuesday app mislead me into thinking I received a free large 1 topping pizza, but it was a gimmick.  Because they have it under "My Stuff" doesn't mean you get to redeem it.

The other deal they have is to get 25% off of your order online for carryout only.  While I was at the store, I check the online price for a large one topping pizza.  It was $18.95.  With 25% off, this leaves a one topping large pizza for about $14.

Well, the deal at the store is 2 large 2 toppings pizza for only $22.  That would price a large two toppings pizza for only $11.  Now, (1) why would anyone go online to order if the price is substantially higher, and (2) what's the purpose of using a coupon from T-Mobile when it is cheaper to go the store and order.

This Papa Johns location is clean and the staffs are friendly, this is not a reflection of them.  However,  I will no longer go to Papa Johns and Uninstall the T-Mobile Tuesday App immediately.  All of the deals on T-Mobile Tuesday have a gimmick, do not use it.<//Review>

This time, the person answering was not very clear when I asked about specials and it felt that she was rushing to hang up and keep working. I ordered food for pick up, only 2 employees were working that Friday evening so they seemed busy. I totally forgot to ask for condiments and they were not offered either so I didn't get neither Parmesan cheese nor crushed pepper, which was a bummer!
Other than that, I love the taste of their pizzas.< /Text><gmapID>0x80d94fba02ddc2cb:0x89e5a6c3a3e0b600< /gmapID><rating>4<//rating></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>If you want fresh ingredients, good tasting sauce and excellent dough, order a pizza from Papa John's.  You get what you pay for, and you definitely pay for better quality of ingredients. I've never had a problem with this store, and the service is relatively fast. After 9pm you have to give money and receive your pizza through the window. Guess it's a defense against people robbing it or something. Love this place!</Review>< pictures>

This place is the best, and its a little sad too see people commenting on orders taking too long,
they always tell you if it will take a long time and its to be expected if it’s during rush hour(dinner time 4-8) If you order during rush hour, and complain that it’s not there within 35 minutes then just consider that a lot of people order pizzas at once and its unrealistic to expect it that fast. Maybe having a three story building with ten times the staff extra ovens etc It might work but with the limited space they will inform you of when your food will arrive so don’t worry. Anyway, all great experiences with this location and I love the place.< /text>

However, this location has become incredibly unprofessional to its clientele. They allowed for my wife and I to stand outside, at night, in the cold for a good 5-10 minutes. No greeting to us or to the other customer who got to wait inside. The general manager definitely does not seem to have good customer service skills, giving me a very weak apology.

<text>The website specifies a carryout special but, will not allow you to place order. Even though the offer still reflects online, the store would not honor it.</text>< Rating>

<Review>Spend 30 mins. being shifted from one papa johns from another. This one told location told me it didn't deliver to my address even though, it was 1.5 miles away. I had a friend try to order from there, when they didn't take my carryout order... And she told me she saw a cockroach inside there so she didn't order anything at all. So this whole experience soured my view on mainland pizza places. At least papa johns.< /Review>< GmapID>

Decent food, friendly staff. Burritos are good, nothing exceptional. Got the burrito bowl, lots of food. Fish burrito lacked a lot of fish, but what was there was very good.<//review>

This little hole in the wall is an awesome place all around. From the food to the people. Anytime im in town this is my go to spot. If you haven't ate here yet you're missing out. What are waiting for?
My favorite is the build your own nachos! Hands down best nachos I've ever had!!!<//text>

<review>Tried this place for the first time today. Paid just under $12 for two Taco Authentico and a side of chips and salsa - not including tip.

One word to sum it up: bland.

So bland. Asada meat was chewy and bland. The Verde sauce was flavorless. Even the onions were bland. The cilantro was the only tasty item on the tacos and that was sparingly given. The one slice of lime I was given for two tacos was dried out and juice less.

The chips and salsa: chips are good. Salsa was... bland. Smelled amazing and made my mouth water but that's about it. On my third chip I did get some pepper seeds which gave it a little spice but overall disappointed.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The food was okay at best. honestly over priced for what you get. Their meat wasn't the best either. It was dryed out and they give you an extremely small amount. The steak bruitto was mostly beans and rice.< /review>

If you charge for that little scoop of sour cream at least post it that you charge a dollar extra for a small spoon full. Made me have a sour mood all day and I will not take my business to this place anymore. I don't like the surprise charges at the end.< /Text><name>George Buchanan<//name>< Rate>

Great authentic Mexican food.  There are a variety of options and the staff is amazing and so friendly.  My family would rather eat Baja over Burrito Bandito any day of the week.<//Text>

<text>Oh my gosh, the burritos at this place was so good I couldn't believe it. oh wow, I just remembered that I actually went to this burrito place. It's in Redding California. I got a burrito bowl and I don't remember what kind of meat but there was not the steak and not the chicken but o ya, carnitas. Yeah and it was pretty good.< /text><resp>None</resp></record>

It's good that's for sure. But I just paid 27$ for two tacos and a burrito bowl. Their soda for a small was $2.89!! And a Jarritos $2.99. outrageous price, but good. The dichotomy of it is perplexing.<//text>

Way too expensive for mediocre food 19$ for a burrito with chips and salsa and a small drink? Yeah I will not be coming back I also did not see any hot sauce around at all which was a disappointment. I had planned on staying to eat my lunch but I ended up just taking it home since they didnt have hot sauce readily available. The lady who made my burrito was In a rush when there was no one being me but she was friendly. I'm surprised this place hasnt tanked.< /Review>

When I moved to Redding, I used to go to this place all the time because it was down the street. It's consistently great! The staff is really friendly and they get to know you if you go there a lot. The giant and breakfast burritos are unparalleled in Redding. Their habanero sauce is super good. Better than "gringo" burritos at Burrito Bandito.<//text>

I grew up in Riverside Ca so i was raised on real Mexican food and i find it very difficult to find good food this far north most Mexican food joints up here have white kids making the food which is no bueno   but  at Baja Burrito is run by a Mexican family and it shows in the flavor and quality of the food so I say THANK YOU Baja Burrito because with out you I would starve.</Review>

Very nice informal and friendly place for all kinds of gaming. Mtg events had good turnout. Board and card games, D&D, table top.
Like most game stores I visit, the bathroom was one area that has room for improvement. Needed a new lock and thorough cleaning.<//Text>

Ed is super nice, went there about a week ago. Really informative, from gaming aspect, to painting aspect, Ed is very informative, you can ask the guy anything lol. The store is nice and neat, you can find what your looking for without moving too much. And everything sit nicely along the prices. He also have a good amount of painted collection that I highly recommend checking out, his SAMURAI Space Marines is unique in it own way, a league of its own. Will be coming back for sure.< /Review>

Very knowledgeable staff, wide variety of games in stock. Location can be hard to see at night, but once you know it's that's it isn't an issue. Being open late is always a plus for me as well. Would visit again if I'm in the area.< /text>

<review>A place to game and be friendly with others. Great to relax and play games like D&D, magic the gathering, Warhammer 40k, bored games and many other games. Edd the owner is a great person and really friendly. So if you are looking for somewhere to get miniatures, books for games like D&D or other such games and card games like magic the gathering then that's a good place to go to.</review>< pictures>

I have been going to ronin for a year now to play magic and get my magic products. Ed and Steve have created an awesome store that welcomes everyone from novice to experienced players. When I first went there I had  never been to a FNM and Ed was really welcoming and paired me up with a great player that helped me rebuild my deck. I now go to play commander and i really enjoy the store. The prices are great and I am happy to support a local store. The environment is great for kids and for adults. I really recommend it to everyone!< /Review>

<text>Went there in the evening, it's really hard to find when it's dark out(not the fault of the shop, it's just that the street is poorly lit and the parking lot isn't very good). Very small area for retail sales, not much actual product, more focus is on game playing area(which isn't a bad thing). The interior is well lit and spacious for gaming, but if you happen to want to just browse or need something for a game that isn't supper common... look elsewhere. Also, their miniatures and paint selection exists but... you'd be better off looking elsewhere really.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This is a great game store. Ed, the owner, is really cool, and its a great place to play games. Seems to be mostly Magic the Blathering and Warhammer. It actually devotes far more floor space to gaming tables than product.

My son hangs out there all the time, and really enjoys the people who frequent the place.</text>

The owner Ed is super friendly, prices are pretty good, and if they don't have what you're looking for Ed can usually order. Highly recommended store if you're into trading card games, table top games (Warhammer 40k for me) or need figure painting supplies.</text>

Now i know every one who shops at this place has their own experience with their own gripes, with that said  i have my own story to tell. It is all about customer service. Forget about the stuff they carry . We all know it a gamble from the start so good or bad that part is all on us.
Back to customer service this place is top notch in helping me out in a situation that most places would push back with what i claimed to have taken place  have in mind i had proof for what i said what happened and not even one bit of backlash the assistent  manager the tall guy wish I knew his name he always there  when I'm there shopping . He was the nicest person  took care of my problem  not even try to push back  on the spot I was satisfied and happy to be a loyal patron of this liquidator .
Thanks Bulldogs for all you do

<review>This place is absolutely terrible to shop in. I checked the website on my computer at home to determine if there was something there I wanted to buy. I found a generator and tried to call about the availability however no one answers the phone. So I decided to go and see the place. Of course the generator that was advertised on their website is not available. I talked to one of the associates and ask him if he had an inventory listing of the products they have on hand. He told me no they do not and they do not log items into the computer as they come in. The bottom line they do not know what they have in the store you just have to go there and roam around until you find something you like. I would rate this place as a POS.

This store is just a mess! Super disorganized and messy, Nothing works, and everything is overpriced! All the boxes on the shelves are open! And half the stuff is either chipped and broken, or missing a super important part! I was interested In a vacuum in the store and I noticed it was already used! I do not recommend this store to anybody! NEVER AGAIN!<//review>

Messy, extremely overpriced, broken, dirty, disgusting merchandise. There's no way their prices are "discounted". I compared and half the stuff they're selling prices similarly OR LESS on Amazon or at Walmart/Target. If you're looking for lower prices, there's better priced and cleaner/nicer/newer stuff on Craigslist. Extremely disappointed, no need to visit again.< /Review>

<text>Whats the point of going to this store to buy items when the people in charge of cleaning the store is taking merchandise for themselves. You dont go to a walmart or target and have the very same employees hoarding merchandise for themselves. Makes since why they have a mantel covering their carts, for all the merch they keep for themselves.< /text>< Pics>

Bulldog!! I used to go every other day to this place, since 2017, buying stuff and getting good deals sometimes broken items that at the end Bulldog’s was exchanging with no hesitation. Now June 2019, the staff treat you like they don’t need from you, they treat you like you’re there to ask for a favor instead of recognize you give them a check for their families, for example some cashiers have been so impolite; you have to like them and be like their close friend to give a good deal or good service!  Now they don’t want any returned merchandise, they will tell you, not to return anything at all, because they are giving you a good deal already, I didn’t agree to this and now those guys do all possible to make my shopping experience a nightmare suddenly telling you Back Off!! when trying to get products, only a few other employees will give a real customer service and have been helpful and know the importance of serving you as customer..Bulldog! Customers are always First, and always agree to us, is one of the rules for a successful business.. Still taking this matter to the appropriate owners, so much stuff in my possession that is broken and can’t just do nothing about it, California laws are clear, money back or exchange products..and the most important, do not discriminate against for race or ethnicity..I don’t hide,  this is my Real account I’m a profesional and educated by the best Mentors in USA, I know 100% what is to serve a customer.. Bulldog you must train your people to respect, provide value, and learn how to Serve customers! 🔟❌💪🏼👊🏼< /Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>A year or two ago I would have given them 5 stars but for the last year my experiences have been very unimpressive and worse.  Their merchandise has been really second rate and their prices have gone up dramatically.  On the rare occasion I find something I want it almost always is cheaper online in new condition compared to torn, dented and stained condition at BullDog.   A fair amount of their stock comes from items which don't sell on Amazon by FBA (third party) sellers who ask Amazon to "destroy" their merchandise to avoid inventory fees.  I do agree that their employees are very pleasant.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c29c9b22cc8b1d:0x127e639360687bc8<//gmap_id></record>

<resp>None<//resp><username>hans montoya</username><text>First time buyer at this location. Let me start of by saying , good customer service. Before the store opened and while I was waiting outside I spoke to a few customers about what type of pallet have they bought and their experience. They all told me the same thing. Its all TRASH ! I should of listen to them but I took my chances and literally that's what I got . I can't believe what I found in the pallet, empty Gatorade bottles, empty boxes and some with trash in them, random left over stuff from other things and most of the stuff was either broken or missing parts. It was a big disappointment knowing that I got ripped off. If the store doesn't have the merchandise to fill a pallet don't throw trash in it and rip people off. I don't recommend this place at all and I would never waste my time going there again.</text>< user>

The inside is ran pretty smoothly although the receptionist is not professional at all. It’s was packed but they got to us fairly quickly, which I did like. They have a lot of artist and have a nice set up.
Now here’s where they went wrong. I have never had a set of nails not last me almost two weeks. Getting closer to end of the second week they usually start falling off, which I don’t mind after that long because I don’t like to get a soak and don’t like to get them filled, I get them redone from scratch every time. Well my first and last time visiting this here shop. Sweetie my nails were dope the first 3/4 days, compliments from everyone, then my thumb nail falls off like a Lee press on. No biggie I can go get it fixed, only before day 5 can get here for me to get that one fixed my pinkie and pointer finger falls off. Not cracked but came off my nail clean as if they took fake nails and just pressed them on top of mine. I had an event that 6th day and wasn’t able to find anyone as my family event was out of state. Imagine my embarrassment people telling me how gorgeous my nails are then noticing damn near a hand missing between the two. Smdh I came here because this is where my good friend frequented before she passed, but now I see why she would be upset because her nails would break off, I thought it was something she was doing, and it was she was going to the wrong nail shop.< /Text>

This place is always busy! Not today I got lucky and only waited 5 min for pedicure and 5 min for a nail fill. Both technicians were nice and curious.</text>

They are always mean there! The technicians are extremely rude!! They try to tell you what you want instead of the other way around!! We all are different & have different likes! They forget they work for the consumer!
No thank you!  I don't need them rude ladies & services they provide!
Plenty of other places around with better quality of service and technicians!!!<//Text>

I went in for a full set. I just wanted something very basic and it cost $50. The lady was in a rush and my nails are crooked and she missed some spots to put acrylic. It's not even a week and I need a full.  I didn't get what I wanted and I needed them done right for my engagement photos. Now I have to go back before my shoot smh<//Text>

I use to love this place, but they're in too much of a rush to do a good job on your nails. The way she applied the acrylic had my nails looking lumpy, bulky, and uneven. She was able to do the design I wanted well on most of my nails, but the other ones don't look good at all. I asked if she could buff the design out on the bad ones, so I could fix it myself at home. She refused. She gave me $5 off my $65 set, because she knows how terrible they came out, but I'm really disappointed she didn't want to just buff out the design, so I could fix it myself. Now I have to go home and basically redo my nails. It started out as a pleasant experience, but it wasn't worth the wait or $65 for the set I got . I'm really bummed and I feel robbed. Time to find a new shop ladies! This one ain't the spot anymore😔< /review>

This nail place is horrible so unprofessional asked a simple question if they have been busy for a walk in and got hung up on I called back and asked why I got hung up on and she said I asked too many questions and that I can figure it out my self. She was so mad and so disappointing never coming here again and I suggest you do the same. Such a disappointment, this is not how you run a business!<//review>

<text>I got my nails done about 5 days ago and my cuticles still hurt from how my nails were taken care of... The lady also left my nails not filed smoothly so I had to file them later myself. Don’t recommend this place if you’re looking for comfort with your nails. It’s purely a just a cheap place to get nails that look good but will keep skin irritated.< /text>< Time>

Overall quality is great.Waited about an hour after appointment time because I waited for one particular person(Julie?)You can't come to a nail shop and expect to be catered to 100% a lot of the reviews on here expect that and forget there are other people in the world.I see a lot of complaints about the employees attitudes, but you have to understand a lot of the people they have to deal with all day.Employees are human too. Anyways great job and I didnt see anything sketchy or dirty.I do mechanic work on the side so my nails and skin surround are always trashed they did an awesome job and a week later they still look great</review>

This is a very popular nail shop and is forever busy.  Making an appointment is good because you can request the nail tech of your choice however you you most likely won't be serviced at the time of your appointment...so be sure to have plenty of  patience...< /text>

<review>I called for my mother called earlier today and the woman who answered very disrespectfully said that I could look up the information online because, "she is asking too many questions"

Is that how they treat their customers?

<Review>Oof, if I could give this place 0 stars, I would. It’s gone downhill the past couple years. The work is excellent every time, however it doesn’t make up for having to deal with the demons they call “receptionists.”
They’re extremely unprofessional, rude, and lack any sense of what customer service is. I can’t imagine where they found these girls, LOL! It’s honestly a JOKE. I was going to come in for a fill today, but after the receptionist was unable to give me an estimated wait time even after taking my name, I wasn’t impressed. The final straw for me though was a fight that broke out at the desk over who was “next” in line. Of course, the receptionist did little to quell the anger of the customers. So yeah, great nail techs, AWFUL customer service! Save yourself the time, do not come here.</Review>< pictures>

This is how my nails looked after she removed my previous set and she mentioned this was normal when removing them. She tried to get me to spend more money by offering gel acrylics, I declined to get regular gel nails. The second lady cut my nails even shorter all the way to the bed. I mentioned that I wanted to speak the manager in charge before I paid but she blocked me from exiting the line and demanded I pay first. After, I spoke to the manager and showed her this picture she said the girls are suppose to soak my fingers in acetone before removing which the first lady did not do.

But this past month or two I’ve been very unhappy with their service and customer service. Most of the workers are very rude and the manager is rude as well every time I go to get my nails done I experience the manager getting into arguments with customers and saw her also try to fight a employee. So unprofessional and I’m very disappointed. Also I spent a good amount of money their and to have my nail polish chip the next day and completely peel off is unacceptable. I believe they use cheap products for gel nail polish. I only recommend powder colors at this point and designs. Due to all of this they will definitely be losing my service 👎🏻< /Text>< Date>

My first experience was cool, at first i was irritated due to being told by the first nail tech she couldn't turn my coffin nails into stilleto without getting a full set, so i decided to wait for the next opening which was a great replacement Ms Ruby!!! She did exactly what i wanted very very pleased, was then shocked by how a basic fill and gel nail was 38.00 dollars when I heard you could get a full set with full bling for cheaper then that, but whatever I will return😃<//text>

Nail technicians are great it's just the environment that's not..  Too many customers bringing their relatives not enough space to sit and wait ..  There needs to be more discipline with the environment and also with the time</Text>

<review>Sadly I no longer love this place. I have come here for 8 yrs or so. Ownership changed hands a couple of years back and everything changed and nothing in the customer's favor!  I have witnessed countless confrontations with the new owners and customers, never ending with a happy customer.
Prices increase at every visit to almost double of previous owner and all the skilled manicures have left :( . Current techs do not have the ability to recreate many of the samples and are rough and annoyed when asking for nail art. What this place was always famous  for.This place was great 4 or 5 yrs ago.</review>< Rating>

< Review>
Pros pretty good nail tech lady’s here and my looks for my nails always come out cute. Price rates vary for what u ask for gel of course an extra charge. If u want an apt your good you still might have to wait a bit but better than being a walk in can make apt from a week ahead.
Con SUPER PACKED 24/7 but I believe worth the wait<//Review>

I must have walked in at a good time because there was no waiting and my daughters acrylic nails took no time at all. She was very happy with the results (table 15). I requested mani with gel and pedi. Again no waiting and wonderful job. I then asked for a flower design and Maria did an amazing job. I am very happy especially with the cheap price.... but then again I live in Florida....</Review>

My first time here, I thought it was odd I got my toes don't then had to get back in line and wait again to get my fingers done. The nail techs are nice but the front desk girl (Tina) didn't have any customer service skills. She seemed annoyed to be in the building and annoyed to have to deal with customers. Her attitude almost made me want to leave. But a great place for nails.< /text>

<Review>Things I liked
The girls at the front desk were nice and helpful and they do have a tone of design  options
I give this place a one star because I don't belive this place is worth the waiting time (i waited over an hr to be seen) the drive and the quality . You might have trouble communicating with your nails esthetician because most are not fluent in English (something I didn't really mind).  The one star is mostly because of the quality. I pay extra for gel so it can last longer and after 4 days the paint is already peeling off and cracking. I don't do any type of work to have my nails to get ruin this fast.</Review>< pictures>

HORRIBLE. I would only recommend IF you would like to walk in for a scheduled appointment and STILL wait for 3-4 hours. If you have time and want to wait THEN I definitely recommend. They made my nails waayyyy to thick. They also overcharge ;) !<//Text>

I went twice by the referal of my sister. The first experience was awful with dealing with the receptionist. On her day off, she came in and was drunk and provoking confrontating agruments with customers. I thought I was going to end up fighting her. I tried to visit there again and was extremely annoyed with an older tech who did my nails. She didn't want to do them the way I asked. It appeared some of the techs were very talented, however, my experience with customer service isn't worth another visit. Now I continue the hunt for a clean and up to date salon. Any suggestions?<//text>

< Review>
I went to get my nails done last month. I had some diamonds put on. The tech charged me 75.00. I couldn’t believe it but I really wanted my nails fancy for vacation. I haven’t been to the shop in like a year. The same job that I had done, I normally paid 45.00 for at the same shop. I believe that they charge you base on the tech and if you are new. I seen my friend at church nails on Sunday. She has it done at 3D and she paid 35.00 with diamonds. These techs are acting as if when they over charge us, the money is going into their pockets. By the way, it’s new management. Stop paying so much. Go somewhere else. If they need more customers they will drop their prices.</Review>

This place is so gross and nasty, they do not clean their tools, I witnessed the lady use the same tools on someone else’s feet, when I asked her to please get new tools she supposedly opened a new sealed set and a few days after I felt a lot of pain on my toe, I have pus coming out of my nail, this is unacceptable.
Do not come here, avoid it.
People are constantly fighting and yelling, it’s not worth it.</text>

First time coming here and they did my acrylics beautifully! Especially for the price. I’d hope for them to be more sanitized though, and they did cut my fingers a bit. Other than that they do a good job with the nails itself. I was gonna give them a 4 but now that I look at my cuticle that they cut pretty bad I’ll give them a 3</review>

<Review>Price for full-set is unreal! Sometimes the nail technicians can be a bit unfriendly or come off as rude. In addition, there can occasionally be a language barrier when trying to be specific about designs and color.... however still great nails at bery resonable prices.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBsjKsrCQM_bdf67fWCK5YxED_-9WCwfy_BksP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d< /Gmap_id></record>

Makes me think is the stuff sanitized 😢?

This place is horrible!! My wait was 40 min with a reservation, and my nails still came off two days after? Called to complain then the manger doesn't take phone calls like what is
That. I had "the best nail lady" and they still came out terrible. First she rude kept changing the price the cracked my nail in half and still got mad at me for wanting a new nail. I'm never coming back and suggest anyone else that wants nails not to go!!!!!!! I'm so mad I have somewhere to and have to pay someone else to fix<//Text>

<Text>The designs are cute and pretty. Everything else about this place is horrible. What is the point of making an appointment, if I have to wait 25mins++ after my appointment time. Wasted my lunch. On top of this, they don’t care to cater to natural nails. If you would like your natural nails done, you will sit in the far back at an uncomfortable table. The table is by a traffic area and you feel squished. Will not return to a place like this.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not good. My nails were done fast but it is like a factory in the sense that your hearded in and out. At first it was great they did my nails fast by 3rd day 4 nails have broken or chipped and one completely fell off. I'd choose another more personable place less crowded and more people oriented.<//Text>

Super long wait times and they don't always allow you to make an appointment. The nails are good quality and great pricing. Lots of designs and colors available. Customer service could definitely improve, they know they have an endless supply of customers so they don't care if they're rude.<//Review>

<Text>Went my first time today. I'm from out of town and wish this place was closer! They had so many designs to look at and choose.  I showed the lady a picture  of what I wanted and she did exactly what I wanted! There was a wait even with an apt, but it just shows how good of a job they do by how busy they are! 10 stars if I could!</Text><user_name>Michele Flores< /user_name><time>1465533719158</time><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I wish I could give this place a 0 star!! First of all, I ask the lady who did my pedicure if they had the specific color in glow in the dark. She said she did so I proceeded to getting my toes done. Once I was finished, I went to Iris (the money hungry nail tech). She was explaining that they only have three glow in the dark colors. I then was confused on why the lady who did my feet didn't tell me before. I told her to forget it, but I wanted a clear tip, so she told me to soak them off. Number 1, it took almost 2 HOURS to soak my nails off, and number 2, the lady that was helping the process go faster took her behind on a lunch break. Once I was done soaking my nails off, Iris was doing another clients nails and was begging me to pay her. She then wanted to go on break to avoid doing my nails!! Then I eventually went to another nail tech and she said that she could do the design I asked Iris to do. She didn't have the stickers to even do the design I wanted so I ask for the manager. The manager was making up all types of lies and it pissed me off!!!! Then, had the audacity to say I asked to have my nails done for FREE!!! Then this nerdy, rude, money hungry, Asian boy named Sun decided that he wanted to keep asking for my card, like hold tf up!</review>

<Review>Nice and cheap . gets really packed and when you get  there. There is a sign up sheet and they call your name. so, first come first serve. I recommend that before your nails are done you should ask how much your gping to pay because I realize that they don't have like a specific payment its like they charge how they feel they did so if you ask before it might be cheaper</Review>< Pictures>

Terrible customer service. Also they gave me a receipt for a certain amount and then charged my card $15 more than the receipt shows. Calling them tomorrow. Will update this review if they don't return the difference. Will also fill a claim with my bank and better business bureau.<//text>

Nothing impressive, not super clean, but not filthy. Gets the job done. No appointments, walk in only. It looks crazy busy, but the wait time is minimal. $40.00 for a standard spa pedi and a gel mani. 5.00 upcharge for gel, which is pretty standard.<//text>

This is not even the worst part!!! After two weeks I took my nails off and notice 2 fingers had fungus on them. I never had that in my life !!! I’ve always went to the same nail shop for 3 years and never had a problem. I will never return to this place again!</review>< time>

The shop does good nails but the customer service is AWEFUL! I literally had an appointment at 11 AM. Came in an hour early knowing that I wanted to soak my old set and get a pedicure. When it was time for my nails a walk in was sitting at the tech I requested so Christina (Tina) told me to get my feet done while I wait. Once done with feet the tech was finishing up at the same time at 11:50. I told Tina I was ready for her my nails as well and Tina decides she will have another walk in who’s been here since 9 to go next. When questing why, Tina said she rotates between appointments and walk ins. I explained that the walk in had just finished with the requested nail tech and that I would be the next appointment. She declined and told the 9 o’ clock walk in to take my spot. So now I’m waiting another hour while this walk in gets a full set. Very unprofessional and needs training on customer and a better appnt/walk in system. It’s not worth the time or your money. I suggest going somewhere else.<//Text>

I'm super picky about artwork perfection and if that means to wait i don't mind being patient as long as the job gets done right! There's always a lot of people because of the same reason, they get the job done; if it weren't as packed it would show otherwise. You get to pick your own artwork, the techs are skilled and up to date on new trends, and i ALWAYS make an appointment. If you take your time seriously make an appointment instead of walking in, and go earlier during the week instead of on weekends. It makes your experience so much worth it. Big High five for this place , I've been coming here for years and have ALWAYS gotten a different tech but same awesome nail perfection results!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Love the work they do, designs are beautiful. You can pick from their designs or come in with a picture and they will match it. Very clean, prices are not bad but the wait is horrible! If your a walk in be ready to spend a good 3 hours there. If you make an appointment you still end up waiting about an hour from your appointment time.<//Review>< Pictures>

DO NOT GO HERE!!! These people have been taken to court by customers in the past. I have had countless bad experiences here. I love the way they do nails don’t get me wrong but to deal with the unprofessionalism & rudeness just isn’t worth it. I had an appointment that I had to wait two hours for, once I was seen they couldn’t finish my nails because it was time to close . They told me to come back the next day and I did and still didn’t finish my nails even that day. I eventually ended up going somewhere else, And they still kept my money which I’m sure is what the lawsuits are about. I can’t tell you how angry I was considering the fact that I was going out of town and couldn’t afford to waste my time getting my nails done for two days. Seriously unbelievable! They do not appreciate their clients because they have so many. You are literally just a number. Never a relaxing personalized experience . They want you in and out. I hate giving my hard earned money to a company that could care less about the people who feed their families. I would go somewhere hands down.< /Review>

This place usé to bé the place to go and have your nails done.   I haven't been here in a while but is worst than before. Ownership changed and not only their work quality worsen but their attitude got worse.   There are no prices set for anything each technician charges whatever amount they want and they tell you at the end.   Listening to the reception staff how they expressed about the clients and nickname them is not only unethical but even illegal.   I will file a formal complaint with the department of the consumer.   It is a shame.   I will not comeback here</review>

I went in with an apointment as well as i brought 2 other people. They told me when i got there at 12 that it would be a 45 minute wait. So then at 1:38 i finally asked how much longer cause i expected to be next. Then they told me another 45minutes to an hour. I wait until 45 min later then the lady said our groups next. 30 minutes passes and 3OTHER people were sat down. INFRONT OF US. Then we called them out an they were very rude an unprofessional. They ruined my whole day. When they can just be upfront an honest an say its going to be a 3 hour wait. The workers are constanly rude. THEY JUST LOST 3 GOOD PAYING CUSTOMERS. Between us 3 we were going to spend nearly 400 here but now we will take out buisness to Magic Nails Rialto. Where they have good customer service/conversation and do a good job. DONT COME HERE IF YOU DONT WANNA BE TREATED UNFAIRLY.</text>

Terrible customer service. My first and only time there, they took 5 people before me even though they walked in too. When I asked why I was told because I was only getting a gel manicure and not acrylic nails so they went first. But if I wanted to get acrylic's they would take me now. When I replied that I would go somewhere else the receptionist replied with " have a nice day".  This is how new clients are treated???? I will never return!</Review>

<review>very rude staff, and still using a paper system for appointments and walk ins, so receptionists ALWAYS lose track of who is next. and the manager, i asked to get 2 $10 gift cards (because my family did the bring 10 $10 gift cards thing for christmas) so i asked for 2 and she said “NO! twenty dollar nothing here!” i was shocked. we don’t go there anymore. we go to helen’s in victorville on amargosa now.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d<//gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

Too packed! I like to feel relaxed going to a nail salon. This place is too hectic, people waiting everywhere, sitting outside waiting! Receptionist was rude to me. I called and scheduled an appointment just for a fill the night before. I still had to wait over 40 minutes to be seen for my appointment. I had to wait in the sun outside, along with SEVERAL other girls. No complementary water or anything. I don't understand what's the point of making an appointment if you still have to wait 45 minutes. I left & went somewhere else</text>

<Text>I've been coming here for 4 years & it's under new ownership. The quality isn't as good anymore & the place is sometimes a bit dirty. Customers, who've been coming here longer than me, no longer come here because they now get overcharge for very minimal work. The nails still look good most of the time. I feel bad because I really love this place, they used to be the best nail salon I've ever gone to, but sadly they've kind of gone downhill.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d</gmap_id><user_name>Vivienne E.<//user_name></record></dataset><record>
< review>
Great price for what you get but it comes with horrible customer service and a long wait. You make appointments and still have to wait up to 1 hr and a half to get seated depending on the receptionists and how many walk ins they take ahead of you. I have witnessed a fight between a client and receptionist that happened over the nail tech not wanting to repaint a clients toe nail because according to them she should have gotten gel nail polish. Here the customer is NEVER right and   because they are so busy they don't mind loosing cuatomers or being rude. It is literrally a sweat shop in there. Not all nail techs are rude and they do nice work but just know it comes with the price or long waits and bad service<//review>

<Review>Tbh this place is a grab bag in terms of quality. If you get the right tech you will get amazing nails for a cheap price, but not all techs are the right techs unfourtunately. If you want to get reliable and good work, make an appointment at a non busy time, you'll be able to choose which tech you want (I personally recommend #2) and you'll be out of there quick. Try your hardest to go just after opening if you want them to give you the best effort, this place gets packed really quickly and is known for having 1hr+ waits.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>This place is hit or miss! My first time was awesome Ruby did exactly what I wanted pink and white powder ombre, they were beautiful. I went back today for a new set I got Tara , she did what I asked just like the picture I showed her so no compaints on that. What i am going to complain about is the mess she left on my nails. Thick spots under my nails and she cut me several times. First she almost ripped my pinky nail off while taking my old set off, it bled pretty good. Then she filed so rough on two of my nails she cut me on both fingers as well as the one from the dremel on another finger. The fact that she charged me full price was ridiculous. But what ever. My advice is stick to whoever's you know does good nails. I'll ask for Ruby every time now.<//Review>< pics>

This place has really gone down hill. I used to love going here back in 2013ish and the last few times have been awful! I will never go back. The wait for a walk in was 3 hours. THREE HOURS. The people who made appointments were waiting about half an hour after their appointment time as well. All I got was a pedicure and it was terrible. She cut deep into my cuticles, the water was super hot, and the design came out ugly. I got one of the design examples they had and the girl couldn't do the design so she completely changed it without asking me! Then, if that wasn't enough, the toes didn't match. When I told her they were not the same (one design went horizontal on the left foot and across the top on the right) she took it off and did it wrong AGAIN. The whole ordeal took forever and it the end result wasn't even what I wanted. Don't waste your time here. It's not worth the cheaper prices anymore.< /Text>

<text>Well we were recommended this place. The receptionist was rude, the place is like an Asian sweatshop with strong nose burning smell. The lady didn't explain very well to my daughter what they had or could do. If we didn't ask her to clarify 3 times what they had who knows what wed get.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I'd leave half a star or no star IF possible. This was my first time ever looking to get my nails done, I made my appt a day ahead. I explained it was my first time and was made to feel stupid for not speaking nail lingo. I was there within my 15 minute window. When I arrived the girls at the front were a little prudish and seemed more interested in their conversation than checking me in. I was told to "wait a FEW minutes" and was quickly dismissed. My appt was scheduled for 1pm and I arrived at 1:10 due to getting lost. I stood outside in the heat for for 45 MINUTES. No one bothered to let me know that their appointments were running behind and the place was packed like a sweat shop. After being ignored for 45 minutes, I abruptly left and found Lee Ann's Nails in the same shopping center. She seated me immediately, was very kind and made my first nail experience as comfortable as possible. My nails came out perfect and absolutely beautiful! I would STRONGLY recommend going to Lee Ann's unless you enjoy long wait times and rude customer service.< /Review>< Name>

< review>
Not coming back here, honestly i feel like they took advantage and over charged me for what i got. I got acrylic/gel and got them cut super short, plain color yet got charged $28 dollars. When my friend went a couple days ago she got acrylic dipp long nails & only paid $23 dollars.
They told me they didn’t do dipp nails there when i went.
They also charged my friend $40 for medium length magnetic color ?
lady said it would be $10 for magnetic because it was more “luxurious” ? it just didn’t make sense to me.
Save your money go somewhere else where they won’t rip you off.</review>

Worst customer service.. The staff doesn't even have coustersy to talk politely to the customer. The gel polish peeled off the same day and I couldnt get it fixed as I was out of town. When I called to get it fixed they said they cant as they had 3 day policy.. The manager refused to come and talk on the phone. The person on the phone is very very arrogant and hung up when I was still talking. This is horrible experience and I no one should go through this.< /review>

<Review>Made an appointment. Had to wait 45 min. For the $45 I payed I could have done it my self. On top of that 2 nails fell off less than 25min after I left the nail salon. Oh and tips are littleraly demanded. Last time I'm coming here. They need updated everything there.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d</GmapID></record>

been there only twice and both times the nail artists have been rude and given me attitude the last one was shaking from being so upset only because i asked her nicely to fix a smudge caused by the girl next to us cleaning up. i spoke to the manager and all she did was say "sorry" seems like she just wanted me to shut up and didn't care.  they do however have the most awesomest designs they do great work but they really need to work on their people skills.  the wait is a long one even though they have like 20 artists and they are decently fast.  it seems they don't really appreciate their customers since they have so many they figure whats one less.  not sure ill be going back.<//Review>

<review>Love the nails. Only thing that I didn't like was that someone wrote down my name wrong and I was waiting for 2 hours. The girls who check you in the morning are rude and you almost have to beg for their attention. And then for the first time in a year the lady that did my nails said she couldn't fit all the little designs on my nails which doesn't make sense since everyone else has been able to make my nails just like the ones on display. She practically took out all of the main ones that I liked and even charged me full price even though she didn't even give me the design that I wanted. Other than that everything and everyone else are awesome. I get compliments all the time.<//review>< Response>

I have been going to 3D nails for four years. And it saddens me so deeply to say that the new owners don’t take care of the salon. The prices are too high and not worth the thirty-forty minute commute from where I live. I used to pay $45 at most for a full set, all blinged out, now I’m paying up to $80-85! The nail techs are so rude and they do a very sloppy quick job. I payed $77 on my last set just for all of my diamonds to fall off within a week. Trust me when I say, it is not worth it!<//Text>

I think out of the many times I've been here, I havent had to wait very long with an appointment (20min max). Today I went (12pm appoint) and was out and dry by 12:45 and at my desk at work by 1pm. Maybe its because I come during off days like any day except Fri, Sat & Sun. They do good work for good price. If you dont want to wait I recommend to go on an off day, be early and keep asking the receptionist if you've been called, they have so many people to look after. Atmosphere is chaotic, its a nail shop, is not a spa. The nail techs are informative and fast. They have the latest techniques and what you pay for what you get is great!</Review>

But, the wait time, even with a scheduled appointment, is annoying. Some of the front desk staff seem unprofessional, even rude at times. After 2+ years of tolerating them, I have had enough. Many  customers have already left for similar reasons. Bye Bye<//review>< pictures>

Unprofessional and rude. Talk about others in chinese language while sitting in front of them. Refused to fix nails THEY messed up. Come in with a picture and walk out with something totally different. All they do is rush. Never going back again. Waste of money.</text>

The lady I got was RUDE! Don't ever tell a customer WHATEVER! She rushed through getting my nails done and didn't do a good job. I got gel nail polish and she didn't fully "polish" my nails. I had to ask her to fix it and she didn't like that.  Additionally, she left the clear gel on my skin on some of my fingernails.< /Review>

This place has the worst customer service. Dont plan on getting your cuticles cut before a nail job. You have to do it yourself. Dont plan to schedule an appointment with anyone your time isnt valued and you will wait for hours. Its better to be a walkin because appointments are never honored..do not get anna (seat 12) for your acrylics she does not care about your happiness or the outcome of your nails. U get what you get dont do it.< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Made a appt a few days, went in by accident yesterday to see if I can come in a day earlier, she says I don't even see your name in the books to begin with. So I went in today, took literally 3 hours for a gel manicure! I missed my hair appt and was late for everything else I had for the day. My 5 year old neice would of done a better job too. Very sloppy! When I went to talk privately to the manager so I don't make a big scene another worker I wasn't dealing with jumped out of nowhere and started yelling at Me! She accused me of lying! Even the lady who was doing my nails was quiet and very nice. She was rude and embarrassed me in front of everyone. I gave them their money and tip and left quietly. But I will never go back there again due to their rude attitudes they have. 2 thumbs down. Top off they made me sit there for 3 hours, they were mad and acted like they did me a favor!</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I've been going here for a few years off and on and the service was ok.  BUT TODAY really really made me angry.  I'm usually the first person on the list WITH an appointment because I get there about 8:15ish so I can request the techs I want to do my nails and pedi.  So, today when they called my name and told me to where to sit at the techs station I requested, I'm sitting there for about 10 mins. and all other customers are getting service but me.  So there was a little tiff between 2 of the techs and the receptionists about telling customers to sit down before the techs are at their station.  Then come to find out that the tech I wanted was OFF THE WHOLE WEEK!!!! Now today is Thursday, why didn't the receptionists know that she was off and put me with another tech.  So I told the receptionist I was first and should be getting services and not have to wait. She tells me she'll put me with the first available tech.  I waited about 10 mins and got more infuriated then I just got up throw the nail polish disc and stormed out.  Every time I go I always have to wait for someone.  So what's the purpose of having an appointment when you have to wait. I'M DONE!!!!! They really need to get their act together.</Text>

<text>If i could put no stars I would. This place is ridiculously UNSANITARY. I got no gel on my nails a few weeks ago and she argued with me about not getting gel. I noticed a few days later my finger was hurting and I didn’t think anything of it. I went to the doctors yesterday and was told I had an infection on my middle finger due to bacteria being build up and utensils not being cleaned. Ridiculous this place needs to be SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Great place good artwork & special details, quality products. Get 3 stars due to disorganized wait time, walk-ins 2 to 3 hour wait.  Even with appt, wait is over an hour.  Also, no customer seating, have to hangout in parking lot or sidewalk, cuz u gotta be nearby when they call ur name or lose ur spot. Still go, no nearby place like this n prices are decent. My sets last up to 3 weeks.</text>< Rate>

<text>The place has great potential and art work is nice but its not worth the bad attitude from front desk and careless owner. I cant believe the non sense and drama that goes on unbelievably bad customer service. Aside of appx 3hrs and still manage to ruin my nails
by forgetting to apply clear after doing my crome. The crome came off the same day. I had to go back the next day because they cancel my pedicure appt and when paying the owner for my pedi I told her she had a great business and told her that she need better customer service she grabbed her cell and put the phone on her ear and did not even dial out in the middle of our conversation no class. I told her I will no longer come again she said "Ok". Front desk was so ruthless saying "I will wall out" pretending to quit the job the day before It was very interesting employee behavior.

3d nails and spa more like 3d nails and hell. So disappointing this business need better management .<//text>< pics>

<text>So while back I came here to get my nails and my toes done this used to be my spot I loved it I'd go all the time and every time I would go I would never have a bad experience until one time I went to get a pedicure and the lady did a pretty good job I got a French tip because I love getting French on my toes but then a couple days later if not like a week later I saw like a little dot on the inside of my toenail my big toe and I thought I had to hit my foot on something or something landed on my foot but I know I couldn't remember that happening so then I went back and I got my toes done like 2 weeks after that and then sure enough it was getting bigger and I was kind of like this isn't right and it was getting to the point where I didn't even get a French pedicure that day because of the fact that you can see the spot so well and it just didn't look right with the French pedicure I was so bummed but I didn't think much of it just that it would probably go away so then I about 3 weeks after that maybe a month I decided it was time to do my toes and my nails again and I didn't want to have to wait so long to get my nails done since the wait time there can be like really long * i waited almost 1:30 hours once* so I was looking for a new nail place and my friend posted something on Facebook  about her being at her nail shop and that it was the best so I decided to go (*by the way BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!! its my new nail place now and the only nail place I'll ever go to and trust that they're sanitized  I swear to God they're the best it's called》》》》》 I Love Nails in Rancho Cucamonga《《《《《*) Ok back to the story so I get there and they start doing my toes and then the girl takes the polish off of my toe and tells me oh my gosh you have fungus on your toe and I was like what and when I looked it looked like greenish brownish and the. Had grown pretty big and I was so grossed out that I started to think how the lady did my toes the first time and the second time and I swear to you I never once saw them pull out the nail tools out of a sanitize bag at all and then I clearly remember when she was scrubbing the bottom of my foot that she had a small foot scrubber and it almost looked used is she even had to throw it because it broke apart which only happens when it's already at the very end and it's super thin and she got a new one and I was so grossed out it wasn't even funny I was even more mad at myself because I never noticed how unsanitized they were don't ever come I rather pay a few more dollars to get a hell of a lot better service and at least I know it'll be sanitized!! Btw hope they read this if you do be expecting the health department one of these days because I'm reporting you!!!!< /text><time>1512042647993</time></record></dataset><record>

DONT GO HERE. I got powder and the lady on number 15 left them SUPER blotchy and SUPER thin. I asked her to fix it and she denied to (ARE YOU KIDDING ME) so I went to a manager and told her she had to so she did BUT she only fixed the thumbs and she left them looking like LIGHT BULBS. SOO thick at the top... (I got recognized on stage and was so petrified when I saw how horrible it looks when I saw the picture. I added the picture of the nails while I was on stage)  She was so rough and MADDOGGING ME! LITERALLY. I didn't even want to argue getting the rest fixed. I go home and when I pet my dog, TWO NAILS BREAK. I drove back the next day (I live an hour away), tell the girl at the front desk, so she sends me back there when the lady that did my nails is done with her client. She's MADDOGGING ME! as I'm smiling (just who I am) and when I sit down and tell her what happened she tells me almost yelling "YOU CUT IT OFF ON PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT! YOU CUT IT OFF BECAUSE YOU DONT LIKE IT! YOURE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT!" OH MY GOD. I got so mad! So I tell her "YOURE CALLING ME A LIAR? YOURE QUESTIONING MY INTEGRITY!? IM NOT PAYING FOR THAT BECAUSE THEY BROKE BC YOU DIDNT DO YOUR JOB RIGHT! I AM NOT PAYING FOR YOUR MISTAKE OF MAKING THEM THIN!" Just then she snatches my hand to see the nails I so called broke and starts yelling in Vietnamese to her coworker next to her and I take my hand back and just then  Her manager is passing by and I call her to let her know what was happening. She didn't even apologize but they send me to go soak it off and after that Is done I wait almost 2 hours! For them to fix these nails. Another lady ends up doing it B.C. The original lady decides not to do it. This new lady is telling me I have to pay! It gets cleared out I don't pay but get this. SHE DID THE NAILS ALMOST 3 centimeters SHORTER THAN THE ONES I HAD AND SHE FILES THEM LOPSIDED. I didn't even bother. I left and can promise I'm never coming here again! These ladies treat their customers like trash and have not a single ounce of kindness to share ESPECIALLY after they have made that mistake. Worse $35 I have ever spent. Now I'm left with a blotchy, uneven, and inconsistent powder manicure and my cousins wedding is today. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND DONT COME HERE. If you do only ask for Lilly or the lady with tattoos. They're kind and do an amazing job. Sucks they work here with the other unprofessional "nail technicians" that give this business a bad name.< /Text>

So simply put dont come here. Yes they are cheap but that isn't always good. If you want somewhere where more than 2 ppl know how to do great designs this is not it. If you dont pay attention to anything else pay attention to this >>>> WHATEVER YOU DO DONT GO TO THE NAIL TECH KELLY!!!!! The short one! She can not do nails! I REPEAT DO NOT GO TO KELLY! Ask for someone else. Every time I've went there I've witnessedsomebody has complained about her and disappointed with her work and she gets embarrassed and starts going off in her language! She hasnt been trained enough for designs but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and what do you know? it happened to me. Long is the best there but talks about you the whole time but hell they all do lol but I hv to give it to her she is good or at least the best there. Go to Jem nails in chino, ca! They are more expensive but They know how to do more complex designs, give good customer service, and don't charge you more to fix their mistakes like 3D. Remember you get what you pay for! Have a blessed one! Hope this helps!<//review>

Fast service and LOTS of options... Make sure you negotiate the price BEFORE they do your nails and be VERY CLEAR about what you want done.</Text>

Girls are rude & very long wait & to top it off when I took off my nails I had this. Came back to the place only so the manager can tell me it’s my fault , then charged me $28 for a manicure & when they were taking  off my other nails they also made me bleed.</Text>

< Review>
What's the point of making an appointment at 11 if they are calling you up for your pedicure till 12:30.. too much traffic I don't believe they can handle it.</Review>

< Review>
3D always busy popular place so I thought I'd try it the lack of experience on their staff when it took two employees to try to get one fingernail tip off of my hand and both of them hurt me and cut my finger I walked out before they did any more damage I would not recommend the experience of their staff but their creative techniques yes but that's all and the receptionist was rude<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I was a walk in and waited over 2 and a half hours. Finally when i got seated i waited another 20 min, there was miscommunication between the workers of what i wanted done and the new manager was so rude. They have no patience and treat you badly. I never experienced such bad service in my life. I had my child and she got fussy at the end because of how long we were there. Ended up leaving and paying 5$ for just cutting my nails and putting the clear gel on, so i didn't even get my full set. What a waste of time. And they need to get rid of that new manager<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

They don’t enter act with the customer who is paying there salary they sit there and speak Vietnamese which is rude, they don’t tell you the prices of what your ordering you just get this surprise bill at the end of your session and they don’t give a damn I’ve  gotten fungus and it was there Fault my nails lift after five days they won’t do anything what you ask them to do I didn’t want my nails long because I’m a cashier it seemed to piss number 5 off<//text>

Overrated honestly. To begin the girl at the front desk is beyond rude and struggles to call people accordingly so starts huge lines and longer then usual wait times. In need of someone new ! She should not be the first person the guest have to interact with . Then not only do you wait forever the work is mediocre at best. By the way I paid $70 for this set which I wouldn’t be mad since it’s gel but girl was super messy and not neat at all. Not going back to over pay for what.< /Review>
