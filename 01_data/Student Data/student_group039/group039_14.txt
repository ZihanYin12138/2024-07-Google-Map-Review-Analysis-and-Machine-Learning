Best pizza and service in Santa Monica! Whether you're in the mood for a classic or something new, SaMo's pizza selection will satisfy. They even offer a hot cheetos pizza. I'm a personal fan of the Mediterranean, which has meatballs, two cheeses, and a perfect combination of fresh veggies and seasonings. They also have fresh salads and sandwiches.

The staff at SaMo are all friendly and clearly love pizza making. You can taste the high quality of ingredients, the prices are competitive, and service is quick.

They're conveniently located right across from SaMo College and just a half-hour walk/5-10 minute drive from the beach.</Text>

Not bad pizza place.The interior design is clean and simple.The pizza is delicious and full.The downside is that the variety of pizzas here is a bit limited, with some basic flavors being the main focus.In addition, I suggest selling more snacks and side dishes such as salads and chicken wings, and alcoholic drinks.< /text>

< review>
I really can't trust reviews.  I ordered this pizza based on the 4.6 star review. I should have ordered Domino's.  It would have been cheaper ($30 bucks for a large peppers/mush) and would have been as good.  This is the first pizza I ever had that was so tasteless we looked at each other and said "this tastes like nothing".  The ordering online and delivery was accurate and on time so the stars are for the service and not for the pizza.  I do wish that pizza deliveries would figure out how to get your pizza here hot.  I was not that far away and it got here at room temperature.  I would pay more for a delivery that is hot.  Go to Dominos and save money.<//review>

< Review>
The crust is nice and thin, very delicate! The sauce is very good and they fire it in a hot pizza oven. We ordered several personal size 10" pies, the pepperoni was great, but the cheese pies were a little inconsistent with the meltiness. They had a great special on a 10" cheese or pepperoni for 4.99 and 5.99 respectively, so we ordered a bunch of those. I also had a house salad that was pretty standard, but good. The pizza menu is pretty extensive, but also pretty expensive! Some of the personal size pies were like $20. I'd like to try the vegetarian pie, but don't wanna shell out $17 for a thin 10" pie from a strip mall pizza stand with 4 tables. Either step up the ambiance or drop the prices.</Review>

<text>Back again at the place my grandson says have the best pizzas in the WORLD. Ah, to be young again ...

The pizzas ARE quite good and their method of ordering is quite easy. You can order a pizza straight off of their menu or customize it pretty much any way you can imagine. Think of it like Subway - except the pizzas are terrific and delivered to your table piping hot.

There is a great vibe to this place and it is catchy. My grandson loves the condiment area (but likes the garlic way too much). they have a huge tree in the building along with some very neat pizza ovens. Make sure you try the Nutella Calzone.

Definitely will be back again when visiting the grandchildren. We could use something like this in New Jersey!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Still the best SAMO pizza  I've had in the three years since my husband and I discovered the place. Teeny shop, one man operation, but he's so good at what he does. The thin chewy crust and sparing use of his delicious red sauce really make the pizza. 9 out of 10 times I order the sausage and red onion. We've had the Los Angeles , too, but I find it a tad too salty. Cash only! thank you< SaMo Pizza</review>< pics>

<GmapID>0x80ea41a983a0f64d:0x1dc95fd9cc0fc6f9</GmapID><Text>This Taco Bell is just fine if you just want to grab your food and go.  The dining room has been renovated and the equipment is up to standard.  The food is typical of Taco Bell.  The staff was courteous and helpful.

However, I found their wifi exceptionally weak though.  Not only was it slow, it kept dropping me off the internet.  This Taco Bell is not an alternative to Starbucks where I stop most of the time.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered food ahead of time so when I went on my lunch it would be ready for me to JUST pick up. I arrive and the dining room is closed and mind you there is a HUGE line on drive thru so I call the store and ask if they are able to bring it outside to me for the reason that I am on a lunch. The employee by the name alexis responds no and when I ask if I can refund she had also responded no (I was able to on the app) she continues to speak w her manager and they make no effort to try and help. The managers name is don and instead of trying to speak to me to come to terms w a solution he has his employee speaking for him. This is the worst Taco Bell I have stopped by. Their attitude and ability to want to help is bas.</Text>

I should have left a picture of my food, but I came in hungry as hell, so you'll have to settle for a picture of the drinks we had.  The Strawberry Skittles freeze was alright, but the Orange Cream Pop Freeze was REALLY good.<//text>

I went through the drive-thru for a chicken quesadilla combo.  Quite disappointed in the quesadilla that came out.  The first section had no meat whatsoever and the other 3 had just a little meat each.

Beyond that they were fast, polite and the food was hot.  Still disappointed in the lack of chicken though.  3rd star because they were busy and probably had to rush the order out.< /review>

I can not understand why consistently almost everytime I go to this location they forget part of my order!! This is food I pay for. No one wants to have to check their order everytime, or go inside, drive back because they are missing items. If you can't do your job properly you shouldn't have a job period!!  ITS FAST FOOD NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. TAKE A ORDER COUNT BEFORE YOU CLOSE UP THE BAGS ITS THAT SIMPLE. THE RECIEPT SHOWS HOW MANY ITEMS, IT WOULDNT BE TOO MUCH MORE OF A STEP TO TAKE!! AND THEY WANT $15 AN HOUR, WHAT A JOKE. I AM pretty sure you owe me for how many items you have forgotten!!</Text>

The sheer number of times you have screwed up an order this month alone is ridiculous. I can only imagine how many people you have hospitalized by leaving on an item they said not to. Try a bit of quality control.</text>

Every time I come into this particular taco Bell, the people behind the counter are very courteous and they do not act like I'm bothering them, also, I have never gotten sick at this taco Bell, I wish I could say the same for the other ones around town.<//Text>

I normally don't eat at taco bell I went around noon to pick up a meal and fealt rush got home they forgot an item call them they say come back and give you the item. No thank you I would have like to have eaten this all at once. I know this stuff happens there need to work on customers services. And yet I will always do my part and be kind we need more compassion with one other kindness with one others everyone has struggle in life . Even give a smile and thank you makes a difference I shell .bless you all.< /Review>

Stopped by around 1:30am. Wasn't busy at all. So orders should have came out perfect. Apparently, they must have been really tired. My chicken in my soft tacos pulled a HOUDINI 😳. I called to make sure if everything was ok. After multiple calls, I guess I woke them up, somewhat. Someone, finally answered the phone. But, within seconds they fell back asleep. Now I don't know how tough this job is (OR DO I)🌝 but apparently, they need more BAJA BLAST.</Text>

Definitely a good Taco Bell at the moment. I notice Taco Bells go though phases, where they go from great to good to average to terrible. Right now this one's on the upswing, with good employees and good food.<//Review>

<review>I just got home with my order, and it wasn't right... But then the girl at the window was probably too involved in her conversation with her co-worker, because when i got to the window she was rude, and practically threw my change and food at me... Just tried to call, and I think the phone is off the hook so that the mgmt doesn't have to listen to the complaints... If I wasn't so tired from working all day, I'd drive back and let them have it... Won't be back!!!<//review>< Pics>

It has its good days and it has it bad. By bad I mean (last time there ) it took 5 min to take my order and I was the only one in there, then it was another 15 min for 2 soft taco and 2 bean burritos. Same thing a couple of time before but not that long. All in all friendly people (sometimes to friendly for my liking) and clean.< /Review>

< review>
Good ok, their taco salads aren't what they used to be, basically they are good for a fast burrito or taco...the day of our visit 3 Moms and 3 little kids under4 running around the whole place, moms not paying to much attention, the littlest one managed to get outside, mom had to run for her as she was already  off the sidewalk, just saying, it's not always like that, just be prepared. I understand moms need to get together and get with other moms and visit,  but take the kids to an inside play area so they can have some kid fun. Playing on the chairs can get boring I'm sure. Have a great day!!!<//review>

After a long drive home from Las Vegas, my mother treated us to Taco Bell. I offered to drive in exchange for her credit card. After ordering (the staff was very impatient) they asked them to see my ID for the debit card. It politely told them it was my mothers card. What i got was a quick sorry and no food. I grabbed the card, picked up my mother and went to another taco bell in hopes that they had just lost $25 of food and me as a customer.< /text>

My experience has been satisfactory to very good at this location.  Their young staff take many of the courtesies that make the experience pleasant such as the cashier greeting me when I first arrive, the food preparer thanking for patronizing the store, and cashier asking if everything was satisfactory while completing he side work nearby.  The wifi was a bit shaky requiring me to login several times.<//text>

<Text>Don't come here. The place is infested with meth addicted homless people. I literally walked in and caught this guy smoking out of his meth pipe and torch in the bathroom. I told the staff but they just laughed and said it was ok. It's not ok! We had children with us.</Text>< user_name>

<review>I wish they would bring back the Nacked Chicken Chalupa. So good!  It was only out briefly the shell was the mildly spicy chicken with the lettuce, cheese and I believe ranch inside.  Add sauce and wow, really great protein without carbs.< /review>< pics>

In love with the enchiritos and always add extra cheese/sauce. If you order the Nacho Bel Granda just be sure to add extra meat or cheese. Menue items are at there best if you add extra. I honestly prefer the flavor combinations at TB over Dell Taco. This is NOT Authentic Mexican food...but hits the spot when you're just tired of pizza and burgers on payday Fridays. Drive thru was really quick and employees were friendly.<//Review>

Ok everyone was sweet but we ordered 4 drinks and were the only customers in there. The cashier barely could take my order and messed up. Then the manager told us the flavor my daughter wanted was out and offered her MOUNTAIN DEW. The entire time the employees were throwing stuff at each other and when i got a refund for the extra stuff they charged me for they woman couldnt even count. How does an entire taco bell not meet the basic requirements. I hear one employee say it had been slow all day.....no wonder</text>

Have you been to Taco Bell before? Yeah? Then it's much like this one.

There's nothing overly wrong with this one, but then again, there's also nothing overly spectacular about it either.</text>

How hard is it to not put meet in a burrito that's it no meat. Apparently to hard yet they want 15.00 an hour to make a burrito when you cant do it right for 12 an hour.< /Review>< pictures>

Disappointed that they CHARGE EXTRA for EVERYTHING,  like for the pinto beans & cheese, they charge extra to substitute one cheese for another cheese. But if you order a bean burrito they don't charge extra for the cheese on it. Ridiculous. I won't  visit that Taco Bell again.</Text>

Five stars for the awesome service.  I didn't really know what I wanted, so I ended up asking a lot of questions, and I liked that the server knew the food well enough to have solid answers.  And it was nice that he was patient.  It made all the difference, I ended up with a really good lunch and a Mexican lager that was the style I like.<//Text>

<text>Really strong craft beer selection ranging from classic IPAs to sours and nitros, plus a strong rotation of ciders. Really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere- lots of TVs to enjoy baseball. Huge food menu which strays from your boring "bar" scene. Spicy fried chicken sandwich, tons of fry combinations ( going back for the carne asada and Buffalo chicken), delicious filling appetizers- try the zucchini fries! And a wide range of burgers and salads.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfa9_eYHA6odC263hdVovWtRNlozrFUWLg2bII=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlC986zifLMp_v6eTsE5e7JDIrMiw4hDzOF-7O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDAj6E0N6XoOZBgk79SIssCQUl3wlXr1qaDfhJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONEegYxkg32OiZ5hyFGR6pmC21SRulrxMPHD9a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM87F5JgNvD_uaXVPLu1yBOrIo53TF41vog6rkn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>4</Rate><user_name>Ankit Patel</user_name><review>Featuring pleasant outdoor seating and a comfy taproom that is among the area’s most popular, Hops & Sessions is a trendy culinary attraction founded in Livermore in 2018.

Hops & Sessions is the valley’s first pour-your-own taproom; guests serve themselves from a variety of tasty beers without having to wait for their server to help.

Regardless of your tastes, you’ll enjoy reading about each beer’s ingredients, flavor profile, and alcohol content before deciding which to choose. For those who’d rather have small portions of numerous beers, flights are available.

Hops & Sessions is located on First Street in Livermore.< /review></record>

< Review>
So, during the Covid pandemic it took 3 attempts to eat here. Twice they were closed during their posted hours. Now that we finally got to try it I can say the food was very tasty but the service was lacking and slow. The waitress was friendly though.. Also, the burgers are pretty small unfortunately. Great taste though. I had the mushroom burger. Wife has the Chicken sandwhich< /Review>

<review>Worst experience ever. Went on a cold night. Asked about heaters and we were rudely told no propane. This person was slower than a turtle and had no customer service skills. Thank goodness we had a different server. She did a good job but the food was terrible. I wouldn’t go back if it was free.</review>< pictures>

The food could be really good if the service was better.  I ordered just frys once and they were so cold by the time they brought them to me.  Then I ordered a salad and they started serving others who ordered quite some time after me.  Very sad for the business.

Point is for a single party the service is not so good.  For a party of 3 or more they catered more too.  There was only one server who was somewhat observant so I gave him a better tip than the others.<//Text>

Really enjoyed eating and drinking here! Lovely food, lovely service, and good choice of beer. My only suggestion would be a different type of bun for the burger so that the it doesnt get soggy.<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Very cool concept! Self pour beer using the wristband they give you.
They have tons of beer here so you’re bound to find something you like!
My favorite was the spire cider, it went perfect with the chicken wings I got.
It’s a bit pricey though, a full glass of beer would probably cost around $7-$8 since it’s about 50 cent / oz.
plenty of seating here but wish the music was not as loud since I can barely hear my friends!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-SNd4J3fbAGBeUNVoRzOXwDvMSzOGDf7Q3O_8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXinMlQ6Zqmb8w0sBUUWvla8qawCoHBZfbWzcE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ_C4-TEN7rmPR8MtQP0E6jdfhVeWw0_6BqVUZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

If you come at the right time you can get a glass of beer in your hand within 1 minute of walking in the door. Simple Menu, top notch quality food. Great selection in beers all on tap.<//Review>

<review>Perfect for a casual after-work gathering, you can arrive, get some very good food quickly, sample some beers, and head out without having to worry about separate checks due to the innovative RFID wristband system. If you're coming for a full meal, though, you'll have to pace the courses yourself unless you want everything at once. And the beer, all rotating self-serve craft selections, is $8 a pint for Dechutes Black Butte Porter, so ironically it's probably not the place for a session, but rather an eclectic sampling. They even had a St. Bernardus on tap, which is very unusual. You also are responsible for getting your own water (in plastic cups). Staff were quite friendly, though I don't quite understand the counter service vibe in a place that is aiming for higher quality food. There are some misses, like the otherwise excellent open-faced burrata and prosciutto sandwich that was drenched with honey instead of olive oil. I hope they will work out some of the kinks because there is a lot to like at this new and distinctive addition to Livermore's growing food scene. Incidentally, all their promotional materials say "Established 2017", which is weird since their certificate of occupancy is dated June 2018.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHyR-jjdRnowzSc8ieDe4NfX9EtS_b7bvhIhk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4fxdfJNykxfmBmirqy39FDYBy24LynBUcSos=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNs-fPIDnowVo99JS4ji7cQVkHI5U0FJgfF9MY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808fe79f9a455555:0xdbe6d6cbc5400fb5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I really like Hops and Sessions, its clean, no line, and the only wait is for the food. The food is fantastic by the way. The pretzels are loaded and the beer cheese is great, the hummus plate is the best I've had, and the burgers have that nice charred and fresh taste, like if fast food was made like the pictures are. 28 beer taps that rotate all the time. Hard to find something you won't like. The staff is also awesome and friendly, they dont judge how fast you return to pour another brew either.</Text>

<text>Before getting beer in front of the many dispensaries for a pint or glass of your own medicine, present your ID for age and credit card for checking out later.
An electronic wrist will then be provided that will serve as a key to activate the pour mechanism and as a reference for the drinks to be paid when leaving.
Many good selections and the place is neat and spacious, not really rowdy as it's sorta family-friendly. Some bites are available.<//text>< Response>

<review>Cool concept, a self-serve beer spot with upscale bar food. We got truffle fries and they were good, but for $8 not that big, it should have been a larger portion. The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is the cost. The beers are all over .50 cents per ounce, with the exception of one at around .40 cents per ounce, so that means 1 beer would be over $8, a little steep especially to serve myself.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO13rRBdGPVR5q-OQqeT41uaayncFXnWTUnqJOW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<review>We were in Livermore looking for a place to get a beer and food. First time in a self pour establishment. We liked the concept loved being able to sample a lot of different beers. Plus my wife liked that she could pour the amount she wanted, which is usually less than a full pint. Food was delicious and the staff was fantastic.< /review>< pictures>

A beer hall style venue with friendly and helpful staff on hand to explain the 3 ciders, 2 wines, and 25 beers on tap each representing Californian breweries with styles that quench all types of appetite. The brain meltdown begins when they tell you "the taps are self-service, just help yourself"...
90-minutes later I'm in heaven... Oh no wait, I blacked out, I'm actually at home lying down, mindblown, planning my return visit...

Hops and Sessions is wonderful but also a real test of your self control.

Amen.<//Text>

You can serve yourself and just buy a small amount to try a beer.. if you like it go back and get more or try something else. I might suggest they add some sound deadening decor so it's not so loud and hollow. I hope the expand the food menu. I'll definitely go back.<//text>< response>

<Text>I first came here during their soft opening and was immediately impressed by their setup. I've seen other places in the U.S. and Europe where you can pour your own beer, but this is by far the nicest establishment I've seen so far. I enjoy the open space, shared communal tables and the ease of getting checked in. The staff as very helpful, and I always enjoy chatting with Thomas and Diego. They do serve food, which has been excellent. I've had almost everything on their menu, and still haven't had a bad meal yet. Hops & Sessions is a worthwhile visit the next time you find yourself in downtown Livermore.</Text><UserId.>113864002829577586370<//UserId.>< Rating>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Cool concept! Unfortunately when my girlfriend and I went we could not find anything we enjoyed. I enjoy a pretty vast selection of beers but theirs were all underwhelming and almost tasted watered down. Nice vibe and interior but very average beers on tap. You'd find better selection at your local Safeway. I recommend Caps n Taps in Dublin for your craft beer (not affiliated in anyway just an enthusiast).

<review>We went in on a Thursday night, it wasn't too crowded. I have a gluten allergy and asked if they had any gluten friendly menu items. They were clueless. They weren't helpful or very accommodating. Their tap machines didn't seem to stop at the taste/pour/glass stops and so we ended up paying for more beer than we really wanted. It seems like a neat  idea, but the execution isn't quite there.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><username>stacy compton</username><rate>2<//rate><UserId.>114088500890432145340< /UserId.>< Time>

A novel gastropub concept that needs a little tweaking in the layout...  I understand that self service with such a wide selection is cool for a tap room.  However, I prefer a bartender or server.  The autotaps have slight learning curve but the big miss is their location.  They were placed on the wall nearest the entrance which limits the front counter.  Add to the fact that you have to order your food there and you have a crowd at the front of the pub and empty zones in the main area .  They need to just adjust the layout and it will go from good to great.< /text>

It's a great idea, but it's kinda pricey for the beer imo.  Why are pints suddenly like 9 dollars?  The selection is OK, but there are other options nearby as well.    Didn't try the food, but it looked pretty good.  I'll probably come back through, but I wouldn't seek it out necessarily.</Text>

Wack! They charge for every drip!  Its a great business model, no beer unpaid.  You pay to pour your beer by the ounce.  What if the tap is not good and all you get is foam?  Still got to pay. This is a fad, just go to a brewery where beer is like water not every drip counts.. Not gona go back.. No taste samples and they still want you to tip even tho there is no bartender or services..<//review>

Awesome tap house, I could taste so many bears before committing to a very nice Belgian Ale... and the food is nice too, they have a chorizo sausage on a bun with coleslaw that was super tasty!< /text>

An interesting concept, pouring your own beer. But there's a wide variety to choose from.< /text>

Pricey, serve yourself beer place. If the tap only gives you foam, you're still paying by the ounce. No thanks.< /Text>

Surprisingly good atmosphere on a Monday with a helpful staff, only complaint would be the beer cut off which maybe should be pushed to 70.0 oz other than that the staff were always on hand and helpful.< /text>

The second day there were technical issues on ATG side. It was good to see them recognize it and try to fix the issue. I would have liked to see them authorize people to leave earlier especially since it was during the day on a weekday. The option to be able to go back in and watch the video later is great and overall I was very pleased as usual.</Text><rate>4< /rate>< date>

<Text>You really will need to spend upward of 85 hours a week on your studies if you want to be successful, but if you have the time and the discipline then don't be scared away. I've had very, very little free-time over the past months, but in exchange I've gained an extremely valuable skill in less time than I could have imagined before beginning the program.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

<text>Cannot say enough good things about these classes. The in person classes are just a wealth of knowledge AND you're given a book with even more information than you go over in class. Times changed and the webinar is currently the way to go. The price is on point. As a technician paying out of pocket for a class I have no reservation signing up for at least 1 class a month. There's always something lost when the class isn't in person but in this case it's only the in person interaction and not the content. Webinars are just as enlightening, but without the need to drive.

I'm a long time professional in the automotive field (40 years!) and have been to a lot of training in those years both as a student and a an instructor and I can say that ATG (fixed the typo!) has some of the best material and best instructors out there, I always learn something!< /Text>

<Text>With a webinar, I have to say it's easier taking a nap during class. First webinar. It was good, I liked it. The teacher is able to stay on point without getting interrupted or distracted. Had one small hiccup but other than that beat having to drive 30mins to class after work.</Text>< response>

Just finished the ATG advanced circuit & electrical training webinar. Class was filled with tons of information, but more importantly provided a valuable lesson in how to think through a diagnosis before jumping in and tearing things apart. Highly recommend</text>

<text>Automotive Training Group has the best training. Their classes are very informative  and the instructor is top notch. I just attended the General Motors Class which was amazing. I have had multiple classes with The Automotive Training Group and I definitely recommend their classes to people in the automotive industry. You will not regret it.

I just had a advanced circuit and electrical webinar by ATG. This was a great class on electrical review and great for diagnosing circuits. Well worth the time spent

Excellent classes, full of useful information and know how situations that helps on the daily operations of the shop, the hands on classes are incredibly dynamic, the material that complement the class becomes a tool at the shop, always ready for a reference or memory refreshment.<//text>

I went to Scan Tool webinar on May 30. I learn to determine, if a PID indicates a command or feedback, in a way that I have never thought of before. The instructor shows to use downstream o2 as a tool for intermittent misfire, clear out some myth, practical use for VE test, wiring diagram tip and more. The trainers keep communicating with us to ask questions as well as answering them. They also provide certificate. I will try their other webinar again.</Text>

This is the way training should be done. They assume we already had the basic knowledge to be there, so no time was waisted on history and development (Thank God). It was more like "Here is how you've been doing things, and here is a more efficient way of doing it"

I would definitely attend more training if it is offered<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>The BEST local training I’ve found. Who am I kidding. I flew 1/2 way across the country to take their Chrysler Drivabilty and Advanced Circuit and Electrical Testing classes at Vision last week and then had the 6.7 powerstroke class local the following week. My only complaint is I wish they came out more than twice a year.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dbff98f79b9fe1:0x3d343ccbbdf11829</gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><rate>5</rate>< user_name>

<Text>ATG is great! I thoroughly enjoy ATG classes. Their books are the most complete books that I have experienced in automotive training. They are written in a manner where anyone can easily follow along. The only room for improvement that I can suggest is MORE!. Bring us more classes and properly market the classes so everyone knows you exist. I'm looking forward to the next class in my area.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

If you are in Automotive or truck repair business and want to learn how to "not throw parts at it" as to try and fix it, this is the best class structure and real world diagnostic way to get it done right!  This is not a class for lazy, flat rate, corner cutting, persons that "just collect a pay check".</text>

ATG has some awesome training. I just got done taking their 6.7 Powerstroke class and it was top notch. Trainer was Eric Walker and he did a super job. I’ve been to a lot of their classes and would highly recommend them.</review>

I attended the 6.7 powerstroke course in buffalo ny on 5/15 and 5/16. The trainer was extremely knowledgeable and was easy to understand. I learned a lot from this class and would attend another ATG class in the future<//review>

Best food, great dinners, perfect atmosphere and great service as always.  I recommend the Pretzel and Beer cheese ALWAYS to start with and the short rib tacos or plate are to die for. See you guys next weekend! 😁<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bayhill Tavern is a not so hidden gem with tasty food with excellent cocktails and good beer selection in a friendly laid back atmosphere.

Above all, the staff and service is awesome! Our bartender John was fast, super friendly and on it. We're looking forward to making this part of our regular rotation.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Time>

From the very beginning , this place was a vibe. The heat lamps kept us warm at night and the beer selection was amazing. I had the double ipa which absolutely went well with the coconut shrimp app and the fried chicken sandwich. I’ll be back again and I’m going to bring more friends.</Review>

<text>Old fashioneds were going down very smoothly.  A great place to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with friends.  We tried all 3 flavors of wings, nachos w/short ribs, and The Balboa burger.  Our waitress Shannon was most excellent.  They have tables set up outside so you can keep your distance in the shade. Fun times ahead.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcnk5VmLRfa8193tNbvnDszQqV0519vr9KzgV2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

The building didn't seem too big but there is so much space. With all the open areas, it feels like you are outside. Also, due to Covid, they have converted the back parking lot to accommodate outdoor eating, which is great for brunch on the weekends. I have been here dozens of times over the past year. All the staff I have interacted with have been super friendly and very welcoming. They have a pretty good rotating selection of craft beers and unique cocktails and the brunch on the weekend is great too. I enjoy the house old fashioned (a man of his word). This place is great for a quick bite or drink or to come for an evening meal. I usually get one of their pizzas. They have not disappointed. Keep up the great work!< /Review>< userid>

The carmelized cauliflower and calamari appetizers were delicious.   The gorgonzola raspberry salad was also very good.

It was a relaxing dinner and staff was very attentive.   Kate was constantly checking to name sure everything was going fine.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Man, I love this place! We just moved in down the road, and it is the perfect spot to take an evening walk to with our pups and enjoy a few beers.  It's super chill, the food and beer are great, and the staff are incredibly nice. It's even dog friendly! (if you sit outside). They are working on building a larger outdoor dining space complete with heaters, but for now, hanging at the bar by the open windows works just fine for us (pic included). Overall 100% reccomend< /review>< pictures>

Great take out during the virus. The 32oz beer doesn't fit in the cup holder, bring someone to carry it for the drive home... transferred to platters at home and felt like dine in. See you after the virus, thank you<//text>

<Text>Just ate here, it's only been open 3days, it is   busy and the staff is already on point.  Our waitress (Janine) was super friendly, knew the menu and was just the right amount of attentive.  Food was really good (Cauliflower tacos were awesome), tasted fresh, and everything was a nice twist on the usuals.  We will definitely be back regularly.< /Text><username>M Lenz</username>< rating>

I highly recommend their cocktails. I had the Pascha which included tequila, cucumber, and cayenne spices. DeLish!  For dinner, I chose the Balboa burger with mushrooms, grilled onions and Gorgonzola on a brioche bun. It was the perfect size for my mouth and totally awesome. I can’t wait to go back. The owner was super nice and even took a pic with us! Next time I’m going to try the Coconut Porter on tap. Thanks Bay Hill Tavern!</review><Time>1568992201779</Time>< Name>

Went here for the first time on Saturday afternoon to have a little dare night for an early dinner. Very nice place and relaxed atmosphere. You can tell as you enter and see the menu that its a trendy venue. 10 dollars for a pretzel with queso and mustard. Id pay 7, max. Its a tasty pretzel, but a hard sell a second time at 10. Im knit picking on this one thing because its a simple dish made "fancy" with the addition of paper thin apple slices. A nice touch, but not necessary.
Skip the pretzel, head straight for a burger. The burgers are cooked perfectly! Super tasty and the veggies are fresh tasting and have beautiful color. I ended up having the basic burger and I WISHED it was just that. BHT puts a sauce with onions on it, or I was told it might have onions in it. I asked for no onions and no fault of the waitress she did not hear me. I should have restated that I can not eat onions because of a food sensitivity. I received the burger with onions and picked them off deciding to try to eat the burger instead of sending it back. I got one bite in before having to sending it back to be remade. The staff was very accommodating and gladly remade it for me. Bonus points there, but I was a little upset that anyone would come around and "encourage" me to speak up about the allergy. Its not an allergy, but because people don't think a sensitivity is necessary for precaution we typically just call it an allergy so people pay attention when we say "no onions".
Other than that one minor hiccup I would recommend this Tavern. And let me make it clear, the waitress who did not hear me initially say no onions was very polite and meant no harm. She was super friendly and showed concern. For that reason alone I will come back.

We have one item on the wish list for this place. A dog friendly patio. We will definitely be coming here on the weekday to check out their dinner scene on the weekday and have a drink.< /text>

Super friendly staff, VERY dog friendly even has a dog menu 😍. I ordered Beets By Bay salad with extra chicken and Sangria and for the puppy some rice and chicken. Everything tasted good. Plenty of TVs to watch some games. Definitely coming back!</Review>

<time>1420899663280< /time><Review>I've been coming to this place since it opened to get carne and polo to bbq since they pre season and prepare it, when it first opened it was pretty good, not the best I've had in my life but definitely good enough to spend money on and come back for, slowly over the years they have diminished in freshness and flavor. This last visit however, was completely unacceptable. The chicken was freaking rotten, literally smelled rotten and the chicken wasn't even pink anymore it was discolored grey in spots and smelled funny. Lord forgive me for not checking the raw meat before I cooked it. I picked up a funny but faint scent when I first opened the chicken to bbq but just threw it all on the grill and chalked it up to my imagination, it was dark so nobody really noticed until we started eating. A few pieces had bits of funny taste here and there, I'm not saying the whole batch was bad, but there was definitely noticeably rotten chicken in there. I happened to have 3 pieces left of the 6 pounds we bought, and upon close inspection the chicken was freaking grey in spots and had a strong smell. Needless to say this was the last chance I give to la famosa, they've sold me borderline food before but it's never been ROTTEN, it's had minor off smells before but it's never been completely rotten like today. This isn't carne or polo I'd take for free to give to my DOGS.<//Review><response>None</response><Rating>1<//Rating>< username>

<text>Everyone I conversed with -- whether on the phone or in person -- was extremely kind, professional, and genuine.  They will even come to your place of business or home to do the work.  It started to rain, so I had to cancel the appointment and reschedule, but Orlando still came to me to meet and take a look at the car and let me know that they are there for me and he will be back Monday to do the repair.  He was so fast, quick and has so much passion.  He did a fabulous, fantastic job, and I was able to drive the car not too long after the installation was complete. Thank you, Orlando!  I am so pleased and extremely satisfied with my experience with Action Auto Glass!  I highly recommend to anyone!!! Thank you for your awesome service!< /text>< Pictures>

I spoke with Luis over the phone and he set me up with an appointment right away. Wilbur came to fix my window and did an awesome job, as you can see. He’s was also very respectful and maintained his social distance and wore a mask throughout the whole process. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely recommend!</Review>

The 2 guys that came out were awesome.  They called me before showing up to tell me where they were. They did a very professional job and knew actually what to do. Armando the boss was very nice on phone and gave a price which was very reasonable.  I highly recommend Action Auto Glass to anyone who needs a window replace. All were nice and polite which now a days is hard to find. Thank you very much for fixing my window. Perfect 👌.<//Review>

I was extremely happy with the service and work of this company. I was referred to them by my insurance company for a broken rear window in my Subaru Outback. My call was returned quickly; a technician came the next morning to look at the damage; the glass was ordered that afternoon; and it was installed at my home 3 business days later. Orlando (the technician) arrived exactly on time and was very polite and efficient, including clean-up; Luis in the office was helpful and always returned my calls. I highly recommend them.</Review>

<review>This past weekend we had some one break into our truck. My husband and I were devastated to see the damage in the morning. They had broken the 2 side windows. When I called Action Auto Glass in the morning, I could not contain my tears as I explained to Hector what had happened. Hector was so kind and helpful that he made the process of replacing the windows a smooth one. What felt like less then 20 mins of calling Action Auto Glass, I had someone at my house to replace the windows. The gentleman who arrived to install the windows was kind and assisted in cleaning up all the glass from inside our car and from the ground. I can't express enough, how truly thankful I am for all the staff I came in contact with at Action Auto Glass. Thank you!!<//review>< UserId.>

This is a great company for windshield repair or replacement.  They spend a good bit of time to be very detailed and accurate with their work and do a comprehensive and great job.  I was impressed with their attention to detail.  If you need this type of work done, I think that this company would be a good one to use.<//review>

<Text>This place and employees were awesome!! My work van was broken into and drivers window was destroyed. I took it to these guys about 8 am ( this is after I was told by dodge dealership that it would take 2 days to order and repair). These guys said it would be done by 2pm that day. They called me back at 10:30am same and it was ready. I would highly recommend these guys to anyone for glass repair<//Text>< Pics>

Great customer service! Action Auto Glass has a very accommodating and friendly staff. They met me the same day I called at an appt across town because they new I couldn’t leave my car window smashed open while I was taking meetings. Super detailed and reliable work. I highly recommend this company for your auto glass needs!< /text>

They gave me an appointment the next day. On the day of the appointment, my phone was bugging which made it hard to coordinate a time. They gave me a 15 minute warning, texted, and emailed me and waited 10 minutes for me. I really appreciated the communication and commitment to helping me keep the appointment. Very nice and professional.</text>

<text>I had a great experience with Action Auto Glass recently for a windshield replacement. The person I spoke to on the phone to set up the appointment and find the right part was very nice and helpful. The technician who came to replace the window, Joseph, was also great. He updated me on his arrival time and finished the job quickly and professionally. I highly recommend this company!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c29c0518c3dc81:0xa6fc53014df76f1e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fernando provided outstanding customer service and the technician's installation of the front windshield was very professional and efficient. I called all the shops in the area and their pricing the most reasonable. I highly recommend doing business with this company! Thanks Fernando!</text>

<Text>My windshield broke and I was quoted $450 by one of their competitors. Action Auto Glass saved me $170 and I had the windshield delivered and installed for $280. AMAZING!!! The technician, Jose, was punctual and wasted no time. He popped the old windshield out and had the new one installed in less than 45 minutes. He even put my new windshield wipers on free of charge. I'm extremely satisfied with my service and I would highly recommend Action Auto Glass to anybody. Thank you all so much!!!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c29c0518c3dc81:0xa6fc53014df76f1e< /gmapID><user_id>100160701799634704999<//user_id>< Resp>

Their prices are affordable and reasonable. Service is 5 star and trustworthy. I had my 2007 Camry crack while on the freeway. I had to exit and google searched for a replacement. They came up, great reviews and stopped by at their shop. I got lucky they had my wind shield in stock and took care of it in an hour.<//text>

So... I woke up in the morning to find out the window was smashed on my car and the thieves took off with some stuff. Ring Ring... Paul answered the phone and took great care of me, and sent William (only a few hours later)! Incredible service and highly recommended!!!</Review>

Had a 4 week delay because of Ray, the Action Glass employee in charge of the repair.  He said he submitted the necessary work on the claim and for 3 weeks blamed the delay on "hailstorms creating a backlog of claims."
After the preventable delay, the window installation was fine.< /review>

<user>109440817359868990875< /user><Text>Had a rock hit my windshield this morning so I looked online and saw found Action Auto Glass with around 50 reviews and a 4.5 out of 5 rating on yelp. I spoke with Ray and they were able to look at my car IMMEDIATELY! Turned out the rock strike was a double combo connected with a crack (a nightmare for MOST glass repairs techs). Chris did the repair on my car and did an absolutely WONDERFUL and FAST repair job. Both Chris and Ray were thoughtful, respectful, and you can see that they care about the customer. Total time from me arriving at their shop to me driving away was around 75 minutes and a more then fair price for the repair. THANK YOU Action Auto Glass for making my horrible morning not so bad and you have earned my business for life.</Text><user_name>Mike<//user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

We were on the hunt for a good restaurant for dinner recently and we ended up at Chula Vista Farmers Table. This is a new location for this restaurant in this city. We were seated promptly and was greeted by our friendly and attentive hostess. We ordered an assortment of dishes, from chicken to salads to pasta. The food was very tasty and memorable. This restaurant is on the pricey side but we do understand that quality costs money. We will be back for brunch one of these days<//review>

The wait time was great for a party of seven. We waited no more than twenty minutes. The food was great and the portions are a good size. The four star is for the wait time after being seated as I had to ask twice for someone to take our order. We had been there for 10+ minutes and no one had taken our drinks order. I understand it was also one of the busiest days of the year. However, after this issue the server was great. My husband had the Jambalaya while I had the Pecan Crusted Chicken Sandwich. Would definitely recommend it! 👌🏻</Text><Rating>4<//Rating>< gmap_id>

A bit on the pricey side for Chula Vista but really good food. Both the short ribs and the salad was delicious. Friendly service but maybe new at the job...goofed up and added the neighboring table’s dessert to our check. Then after pointing out the mistake and correcting it, gave a free dessert to the neighboring table. I was perplexed by that customer service. The ambiance is gorgeous and the one drink I had was so good. Girls night out beckons!<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I feel a responsibility to the people of southern San Diego to provide reviews that critically critique food, service, experience, and atmosphere, so the citizens of America's finest city can spend their hard-earned money on a restaurant worthy of patronage.

It is with great pleasure and pride in my community that I award Farmers Table with 5 golden stars. When we arrived with a reservation my wife and I were seated immediately! We reviewed the menu and were advised by the servers on some great options for beer and popular cocktails. My wife was stuck between 2 beers to order. The servers brought us samples so she could make a more educated choice and selected an airy Belgian beer. I ordered a blueberry moonshine cocktail. Both of these drinks were stupendous and set the tone for a night of luxury and impeccable flavors.

The sampling of drinks was the only start of the amazing service. For our meal, we ordered some specials - a surf and turf for my wife and game of the day for myself. My steak was seared with divine intervention. It melted in my mouth and the fat was perfectly rendered. My wife's steak, to her dismay, was slightly overcooked. We informed the server and the chefs promptly seared a new stake to her liking. The gravy was an exquisite blend of chocolate and red wine glazed over the meat like a chocolate dream.

For my wife's stake being slightly overcooked, our Server provided a desert free of charge. A bread pudding topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a few fresh strawberries and blueberries drizzled on the plate. The desert was incredible - I am not typically a fan of bread pudding and I ate most of it.

I feel so much guilt for not having the vocabulary to describe how incredible our experience at Farmer's Table was. Kudos to the staff, the chef, and the managers of this new location. You have earned two loyal customers and I am proud to say Chula Vista has a new affordable and high-quality restaurant in our neighborhood.

Thank you so much for the great evening.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I want to start by saying I'm not suggesting you shouldn't visit this place because I'm all about supporting small business.. I just want to add that if have high expectations you might be disappointed. I Really wanted to like this place! The service was great and very cute decor. It has a lot of potential too but if you want to charge on the higher end then your food needs to carry more flavor and finesse. We came for brunch and Food was completely bland and packets of Ketchup and tapatio were thrown on top.  Bread was barely toasted and not even buttered or butter on the side. We had to ask. They claim to be using organic and high quality ingredients but then they give you a processed coffee cream packets. It just made it feel like you were at a Dennys paying the double the price. Their truffle arugula potatoes were the best out of the whole meal but you have to pay extra for that. I hope they consider adding fresh salsa instead of tapatio and organic creamer to go with the organic coffee.</Text>< userid>

The Chula Vista Farmer's Table must be having a soft opening, and I'm sorry to say not a great one. I've been there Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Both times have been good. Don't get me wrong, it's been good. But if you are one of the unfortunate people that have a bad experience is because of the management of the servers.
Again, don't get me wrong. My servers were great and we'll trained, so far none of them have been amateurs. But they did seem stretched thin. They really did their best and can not be blamed. I'm sure it's due to the opening of a new restaurant and not sure of the tempo of the neighborhood.

All that to say, give the location a few more weeks or months and they'll fit perfectly in our little neighborhood of Chula Vista.
The food is a little pricey but the food was good. I'm glad to have another place to go to for breakfast... Now I just have to try their dinner 😁<//Text></record>

This is my third time here. I really love their man candy bacon and their breakfast sandwich. Today unfortunately the service was a little bit off.  I ordered a meal with an egg and I requested for it to be cooked over hard. When food was brought everything was great, except the egg was over medium. i really don't like my told to be even soft, let alone runny. I returned it requested it again and it was over medium/hard. They asked me if I wanted anything else. The waitress was very kind, but I was okay. Lost my appetite. The manager came out with a whole new dish with the egg cooked correctly. He apologized and explain how he himself cooked the egg just to make sure that it would be perfect. I felt bad but I was really appreciative of the effort the staff made to correct the problem. All I can say is they have really great service here and the food is really good. Definitely coming back :).< /Text>

<Review>It's a cute place with a nice patio. The decorations feel a bit cheap, but the food makes up for it. It's big and gets excellent air flow too. I had the acaí bowl (best one I've ever had) and my friend had the classic eggs benedict. We had mimosas but we flies landed in both of our drinks. However, the bartender was wonderful and he not only replaced them but took them off the bill. The staff was all kind and they were hustling. We parked in the structure behind the building and it worked out great.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d94dda64d7a213:0x4d843c8f43801f95</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Really enjoyed Farmers Table. Went on a Sunday Morning Brunch and it was bussling with people. My short rib Benedict was really delicious but my eggs were overcooked, although they offered to make me new ones I declined. I was really surprised how fast the food came out and how fresh and delicious it was. I really like their cocktail menu. The drinks are very unique.<//text>

I went to the Chula Vista location.
I am pregnant and asked for a virgin margarita with no alcohol. I repeated my order to the waiter twice and told him that I am pregnant.
When I got my margarita I tasted it. It had alcohol in it and was strong!
0 stars for mixing up my drink and doing this to my baby. Disrespectful and disappointing!
Not coming back.<//Review>

Unprofessional service. Ordered one flat bread and had it delivered by a dude with a bad attitude who acted like he didn't want to be there. The bread was charred. No napkins, no condiments, etc. I had to get up several times to ask for condiments, chili, napkins etc. It was the afternoon shift. I've been to the Little Italy location so I know the good food and service that Farmer's Table is capable of - this one is not it, especially for the price. I'll be avoiding this location until further notice. Better to go with locally owned and operated businesses nearby.</Review>

<Text>This was my 2nd time here and I want to like it, but....My wife and I both ordered the clam chowder, and both of us kept searching for bits of clam, no luck. My pork chop was good. My wife had the catch of the day. The fish was good, the rest was too salty and too strong...was it the wine? not sure, the sauce just tasted bad.

I mentioned that my wife didn't like the dish and they did take it off the bill.

Our previous time there with my daughter  and her husband and 3 out of 4 meals were fine. It is a little pricey so I don't  want my dinning experience to be a hit or miss deal.

I will give it another try, maybe lunch.< /Text>< Pictures>

Good food for all 8 of us. My 1st visit today but 1 problem I was trying to get a server to help us but they all walked pass me when I was waving my hand. Then another server finally took care of us he was so helpful for all of us. Dang it I forgot his name and he asked mgr what happened to the server in that area where we sat and he told us the server that was there cut his finger and had to leave. So I'm guessing mgr didn't get coverage for us. If it wasn't for this issue I would've put 5 stars.< /Text>

Looks great. I've been here twice with a group and one meal out of 4, not so good. Too pricey to be a hit and miss dinning experience.  I want to like it and downtown Chula Vista needs nice restaurants,  so I'll give it another try,  maybe lunch.<//Text>

Got seated outside with nice heater as requested.  While browsing the menu we noticed the food servers taking food to the wrong tables every time, including ours.  It was kind of a put off that they couldn't get the correct table EVERY time!  We had to remind our server to bring extra napkins and the food was NOT worth the price!  Lastly I ordered the watermelon patch drink twice and I swear the first 1 I got did not have alcohol in it as it tasted only like juice, whereas the 2nd one was really strong and definitely had alcohol in it.  Overall, this place is way overpriced for the service and quality.< /Text>

Kitchen messed up our order and server did sort out but was not apologetic about it. Didn't get asked how food was or if I wanted a refill on drink either. We all have our bad days and I'm sure it's OK normally. Food was OK.<//Text>

I came in today 628 2021 and everything was fine until the food got to my table. I ordered the chill relano omelette with potatoes. It was gross. The potatoes were fishy and the omelette had no flavor. I asked the server if I can speak to her and she said she'll be back. 10 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted to box up the food. I told her the food was bad. She then replied" I'll bring you the check". I was still hungry but ok. After waiting for the server to come back I went to the hostess and asked her to cash me out the poor server had  about six or seven tables. The hostess took my check and my credit card to the server. The server brought back my credit card but didn't give me nothing to sign. I went back to the server and I asked her if there was something to sign and again she told me to wait. I asked the hostess if I can speak to a manager she told me that he was off today his name is Diego. Terrible experience.<//text>

<text>I ordered the chilaquiles breakfast and it was well portioned and everything tasted good. There were a lot of employees just walking around not saying anything to anyone. Then there were some checking on you. The hostess was not appropriately dressed and did not show enthusiasm bor a hostess. Overall good brunch experience. Hot Chocolate was delicious.</text>< pics>

Loved Farm Table. I had a the Greek Quinoa salad and added chicken. My husband had the oxtail ravioli. We both left completely satisfied. The salad portion was big. Raviolis were perfect my husband says. Fresh and quality ingredients. Can't wait to go back for brunch. Perfect addition to 3rd avenue.< /Text>

Was excited to try out this place.  Very disappointed.    I ordered the fish of the day which was a Almond encrusted Halibut.  It arrived and it was so over cooked and DRY.  It was like a old sponge.  I never send food back but it was so bad I had no choice.  The manager came out and asked if I would like to  reselect.  I then picked the steak special medium rare.  When it arrived it was tough and had silvery gristle.  I had 2 glasses of house Red  11.00 is the least $$ wine.  My daughters Carbonara was okay.  Save yourself some $$ and go elsewhere.<//review>

< review>
What a wonderful gift...We need restaurant like this in the south bay. We enjoyed the crab cake, caesar salad, sea bass,and bucatini carbonara...all delicious and satisfying. Finished with a coconut creme brulee...not too sweet or eggy...just creamy and smooth on the palate. Will be back to try the short ribs and pork chop....yeah buddy...our kudos to Jessica...great, friendly and attentive service.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very attentive service, and all four of us enjoyed our breakfast.

Over half the menu is American comfort food, but there are many other dishes with things like goat cheese or truffle oil, which they also prepare well.

Surprise: the chilaquiles were great - crisp and with very zesty green (tomatillo) sauce.

Good attention to ventilation as well.

Very attentive service, and our breakfast dishes were rich.

More than half of the breakfast menu looks like typical US food - "comfort food" - but also variety with unusual ingredients.

A surprise: the green chilaquiles were delicious: crispy chips and a very tasty sauce.

And attention to public health, too.

Servicio muy atento, y nuestros platillos de desayuno eran ricos.

Mas de la mitad del menú de desayuno parece comida típica de los EEUU - "comfort food" - pero también variedad con ingredientes no muy común.

Una sorpresa: los chilaquiles verdes eran ricos: totopos crujientes y salsa bien sabrosa.

Y atención a la salud pública, también.</Review>< Name>

KUDOS!!! To Lane Bryant for having people who show that they care about the client. I was doted on, schmoozed, and made to feel like I belonged there at that moment. Melissa and Jessica were a God-send and seemed to be competent in their dealings with me. I was a kid in a candy store and Melissa knew it. I spent more money than I can afford and my creditors are still sending me sirens, bells and whistles wondering what the hell is going on with all this spending. All in all, it was a good day. My first experience doing something like this was wonderful  and memorable and I will definitely be returning. KUDOS TO LANE BRYANT!!!<//text>

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and asked if we needed help. I said yes and we went straight to measurements. I told Melissa what I was looking for and she helped me throughout the process. I tried on at most 5 bras that only needed to be changed once. I loved all of them. I got one for lounging, a t-shirt bra, a nice bra for going out and another I can wear for going out comfortably. Very pleased with everything I got. In and out within 30 minutes< /text>

Was totally ignored by the ladies in this store. When I did ask a question they just stood looking at me like I had three heads. Won't be going back to this lane Bryant store.<//Review>

Friendly and stylish staff! The employees are always very helpful when I visit this location. The clothes are pretty pricey but you also get what you pay for. The quality of all the clothes is excellent, you won't be disappointed.<//text>

<review>I do love the styles at Lane Bryant. The sales ladies are nice and helpful. Yet today while l was in the store l had to use the restroom. I paid my bill.when l ask l was told that the public  couldn't  use it. Therefore l wasn't  able to shop because l was in a tight and was told  l had to go to Marshalls to use the restroom. To bad that paying customers  can't  use the restroom, and end up shopping at Marshall's instead.<//review>< pictures>

I went in today to find a bra for trying on wedding dresses. Julie was amazing! She helped me find the perfect bra and she was very friendly. I went in last week for shapewear and also received amazing help. Everyone there is friendly and the customer service is great. Thanks for all your help Julie!< /text>

Only place I come to get my bras from now on. I've been coming to this location for years. They have a HUGE selection for everyones different needs &  body types.  Each time I've come, all the ladies are so nice, extremely helpful & very patience with me. It takes me hours & tons of bras to find the right one for me. I literally have to try every bra they have to find the right one.

I've tried torrid & Hanes stores, they don't have anything comfortable & the workers are unless. Love this place. I recommend this place to every women!</text>

<Text>I had trouble with an online order, so I decided to call the store and I'm so glad I did. Brianna was the sales girl that helped me. She found what I was looking for and is holding the dresses for me til tomorrow.  What a sweetheart! She was so helpful, and she saved me a lot of time and frustration.
Thank you Brianna :)< /Text>< pictures>

I got here at 9:30am and they estimated an hour, two whole hours later and they tell me they haven’t even started on my vehicle. I don’t mind long waits, but I do mind when employees waste my time. Employees are nice, but if you’re coming here do not expect your car back anytime soon.</review>

<Review>Great tire place! Under new ownership and gaining business quickly!!! Super professional and friendly!!! They had me in and out with a new set of tires within a couple hours of calling for a quote. They also beat America's Tire and Discount Tire prices too!!! They offer the same deal with rotations included with purchase. They also immediately caught that America's Tire had put the wrong size tires on my car and had let it be for a couple years. Also checked and topped off the oil for long trip.
Highly recommend this spot for!!!< /Review><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Text>Over the weekend my car had to be Big O Tires because of a flat tire.  The service I received from Phil, Ivan and Big O Tires from the service department was awesome.  They even washed my car and worked with my immediate needs.  It is this type of service that puts a huge smile on my face.<//Text>< username>

<text>Arrived at 3:45p.m. to relatively not busy shop. Wanted 2 tires. Was told no problem be on your truck right away. left the place went across the street which was not close to the 7-Eleven grab a few items and walk back only to find my truck is still in the same spot not even touched. So I waited to see what's going on after seeing other cars that had pulled in behind me being worked on I went in and requested my keys once again they told me he'll be right on it so once again I decided to wait. After being there over an hour and a half and still no one touching my truck I decided to leave very disappointed in the management and the operation of this franchise. Told him I come back tomorrow but I won't be back ever. I highly advise against it they'll just tell you one thing and do something else. I  wonder how deep that goes??
Bad experience for myself.

Just got an oil change which they do at a reasonable price. But don't like them trying touch me into getting other work done saying that I "need" it. If I want other things done or more parts, I'd say so.< /Review>

I am a victim of identity theft.  I have an open account with big o tires and had not use the account for 2 years.  I live northen California.
On may 20th, 2020  there was a person walk in to the store 6052 W Cerritos Ave, Cypress, CA and did a service and I got charge for $2000 on my credit card.  I called the store and asked to help me to get more information why the charge on my account, the sale rep asked me to contact the big o tires credit card and refuse to work with me for further information that I can utilize the information to report to the police.  If you are in my shoes, what can you do?  I want to provide to the police more information so they can catch this theft.  If we let this theft hanging around, who will be the next victim of identity theft.  If anyone have a big o tires credit card, I suggest that you should close the account, otherwise, you will get hit like me and unable to solve the problem.<//review>

Came in to get a quote on a patch for a slow leak in my tire and Mr. Thomas was very helpful in assisting me with all the questions I had about it. Was a very busy day for the shop and the team was still able to get the repair done in a timely manner. Thanks again guys for all your help. You have definitely made a repeat customer today.</text>

<Text>I called in advance of making my selection to come to Big O for my purchase.  I was told to come after 3pm.  I arrived at 3pm on Thursday, Feb. 14.  It took three hours to change my tires.  I had to miss a 6pm meeting.  I didn't expect to spend three hours at Big O Tires.

Unfortunately, the installer dropped one of my wheel locks and the key to the locks. Sean ensured me that I would not be out of pocket from replacement and that I would receive new lock and key by Monday, Feb. 18.  It is Tuesday, Feb. 19; I haven't heard from Sean; and my tires are exposed for theft. Needless to say, I am not happy.

I wasn't offered to keep one of my tires for use as a spare. All of my tires were disposed of.

My time is valuable, I was inconvenienced with mistake of the installer. Fortunately, I was off on Monday and I could have brought my car by to change the lug nuts to lug locks.  Unfortunately, I will now have to take time away from work to come resolve and I have to take time to call Sean.  There was no additional compensation offered for my inconvenience.

With this in mind, no, I will not recommend.  I am feeling disappointed about my decision for choosing to do business here.

I will be following up about my lug nut and lug lock replacement soon.  I shouldn't have to do this since the error was not mine.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The team at the Cypress store is awesome! You'll be taken care of by Sean, Andy or Brandon (the owner) and Erik and the maintenance are top notch too. They are honest and helpful. Check them out.<//review>

This last year I changed work locations and am now 40 minutes away from this location but I continue to exclusively go to this location for all my families car needs. Consistency is key, regardless the worker on shift or the person answering the phone this location's service is superior to any other car place I've dealt with. Brandon, the store owner, is extremely on hands and involved in the day-to-day and his customer service is what keeps us driving all our cars the extra 40 minutes out of the way. Trust is hard with automotive mechanical issues and we have grown to completely trust Brandon's store to say it how it is and find us the best deal.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>After calling a couple of different tire shops and even a couple of Big O locations, Brandon stood out to me as a professional I could trust with my truck. I knew over the phone after the first 20 seconds (as I believe we all can sense) that Brandon knew exactly what he was talking about and was very capable. When I go to work in a customer's home, I try and provide the best service I can even if I am in a rush, and surprisingly Brandon was able to do that for everyone he spoke with during my visit. At one time he balanced about 3 phone calls while helping myself and another customer! Brandon's team of mechanics seemed very knowledgeable and capable as well, and they all took the time to do the job correctly, rather than rushing to clear their bays. Needless to say, the search for "my tire place" is over and I will definitely return the next time I need tires or other service</Review>< user_id>

Hands down the best Big O Tires shop around!

I had put off replacing the tires on my Toyota 4Runner for quite some time due to high prices and quotes received in the past—but Brandon (Owner) made the wait and choosing the Cypress location all worth it. Brandon was beyond helpful every step of the way. He spent ample time in reviewing my tire needs and selecting my new set (even going as far in asking if I liked the tread design!) and walked through the pricing and great deal he was able to offer me on the installation. The quote was $100-$200 lower than any other shop I had been to! He ordered my tires to have in stock for the day I planned on coming in for the install. Maroni was also very helpful, explaining any other issues they found while working on my car in what to look out for in future maintenance. I was in and out with brand new tires in under an hour, with no surprise charges or additional fees from my original quote.

Brandon and his team made my tire purchase and installation one of my best car maintenance experiences to date.<//Text>

<review>Moroni was the best example of excellent customer service. He made sure I was in and out before I had to pick up kids from school and kept me posted during the wait. I appreciated you had magazines for men as well as women. I would recommend your business to my friends based on the great customer support and quick service given by your employees.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2ec93d035deb:0x8e8262a8b2ec06b1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Be aware of the Protection Plane it’s a scam. If something happen to your tires and need to be replaced, you have to buy a new protection plan and Mount & Balnce. That’s $50 each tire !!

Update:
After all, very good service, I would like to thank the owner for his understanding.</review>

After my last experience, I will never come back to this business, as I cannot support a business that tries to rip innocent people off. I went in for the usual oil change and the guy told me that I needed all this work done totaling $1200. I took the car to the manufacturer, in which The manufacturer said there were none of those problems.

These guys operate like frauds and slime balls, be cautious before getting anything other than an oil change done.<//review><user_id>110130172187449845336</user_id>< Resp>

Sean at the front counter was absolutely amazing, even though they were slammed busy he was still very professional and informative. The while crew here is great, I came in with limited time and funds and they were able to get me exactly what I needed, in my timeframe and my budget. Definitely coming here again.< /Review>

I went in for new tires, and an oil change and the team was super helpful. The team found that I needed new struts while working on my car, a problem I had known about but didn't really plan on moving forward with due to pricing quotes with the original auto shop that identified the issue a few months ago. When Brandon called me to alert me to the issue he was very transparent and even shared some photos of the struts and explained to me how the repair would impact my alignment, the lifetime of the new tires and the overall daily use of my car. (I drive about 30000 miles a year. I need it to work!) The best part was that Brandon was able to beat the initial quote I had gotten for the struts a few months back. I dropped off the car in the morning and she was ready to go again that evening.

Would definitely recommend this Big O location for friends and family and look forward to taking my car back for it's next round of tires.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<rating>4< /rating><review>I don't write many reviews, but I was moved to because I saw so many negatives reviews already posted.  I have been going to this Big O for over 1 year.  I have purchased tires for both my and my wife's car, had her brakes done, multiple oil changes and some other service work.  I have always found them helpful and friendly.  I am very surprised by the negative reviews, but I also noticed that some of them were 4 years old.  Glenn the manager has been helpful, and even encouraged me to pursue Ford for a possible warranty repair rather than try to get me to use Big O.  He even sent his work truck to me when I blew out a tire on the freeway nearby the shop.
I will continue to do business with this place.<//review>< UserId.>

Horrible service

Today 4/23/17.
I was told yesterday by the manger to come today for faster service since they were backed up . I came today and the gentlemen at the counter said it would take 1.5 hours before they got to my vehicle to check for a leak( same eta as yesterday), seemed rude .I told him that I had spoken to a manager about showing up today , he said he's not here. I looked at the shop and sure enough the gentleman is there .. I finally picked up my vehicle and if I didn't ask why I had a leak the guy at the counter wouldn't have told me. He just gave me my keys and said you're all set . Too bad the La Miranda location is closed .... more than likely I will not return here .< /Review>

<Review>They are always honest, prices are very low, and they do a great job. They do NOT try to upsell you service that you don't need. If there is a bit of a wait sometimes, that's not a reason for a one star review! The world does not revolve around you!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dd2ec93d035deb:0x8e8262a8b2ec06b1<//gmap_id></record>

I never post reviews but need to caution others after our experience. My fiancé used to bring her car here all the time up until recently she went in about a month ago to get an oil change the used car salesman and that's what I call him for being sleazy and completely inappropriate to my fiancé focused more on her and attempting to get her phone number. When she declined he became  rude after the oil change was completed we simply decided just to take our business elsewhere.  We began noticing spots in our garage I did not want her to return to the store I decided to take her car in there myself. first thing I notice the same technician that was helping her was outside smoking. As a non smoker it is a nuisance to have smoke in your face. I showed him the invoice for the service he completed rather then addressing this he continued to smoke and stare at his phone no eye contact just stated it would  be four hours before anyone even looked at the car. For a Friday mid morning four hours seemed  extreme. We will never take our car to that store again bad service and inappropriate advances.< /text>

Came in for 2nd time for same slow leak on same tire they serviced. I asked to at least take a look at it  but tells me 2 hours wait with 2 cars head of you. I think when customer comes for same on going problem that was not properly fixed, least they should do is to take a look at first.< /text>

I have a very good impression for Bigo tire, Brea but Inspite of several worst reviews for cypress Big o tire, I visited this place. The manager or something I don't the position of the person name Xavier, he told us to wait for half an hour and said you are not the only customer, we waited . Till the time We finish our other job and came for the nitrogen. Again he made us waited for more time and said you are not the only customer.
This Xavier should have strongly in sense that "THIS IS NOT THE ONLY BIG O TIRES IN CA."< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Stripped my oil pan plug, then wanted to charge me $400 + 1 1/2 hours labor to instal. My mechanic drained the oil and re-tapped the drain plug for $100. The facility in La Mirada closed so I went here. They won't be long with this kind of service<//review>< Pics>

I think 1 star is still way to much for this place. The franchisor should either do something about this place or close it. This was a big mistake on my part just going there. They only want the sale as far as customer service..you lose.<//text>

<review>Platinum Jewelry has been serving AV since Before I moved to the AV in 2011. I been too every single pawn shop in the lancaster palmdale area and I can with great confidence tell you platinum is the best. There employees have character, One of them I know came from living in his truck too being a employee here for about 4 years. Which says they have employee of sympathetic nature. They will work it out with you. And Treat you with respect. The security guard there is the kindest gentlemen you could  possibly hope too greet you at the door. He has been working there for the sake of his family. And Has a heart of gold. Please pay him respect. And show him some kindness.<//review></record></dataset><record>

They looked through all the gold and silver items I brought in. Told me what was real and what was not. Took a long time but I had a lot of items. Overall good experience and got paid a fair amount.</Review>

I went there with a purpose I wanted to pawn or sell an item I was unable to complete either or but I was given a third option of a loan.. I chose not to take the loan. And I appreciated most of all even though I wasn't successful and what I wanted to complete the fact that the company the man help me load the product give me information and was respectful they went above and beyond and I can appreciate that that's why I'm giving a review today<//review>

Tim made my experience very comfortable. Everyone was professional and explained everything from start to finish. If and when I need a little boost to get through, I will think of Platinum first. I will also be back to purchase as You guys have such good and organized selections!

Thank You,

Sherri Ferguson

See you soon :)<//Review>

My husband and I have been customers for pawn, and purchases at Platinum. We also pawn at another pawnshop because we only have trusted the two including platinum until a few months ago. We are “Pawners” that go right back the very next month to get our sentimental jewelry items. We only pawn these items as a last resort so we are expecting a a fair loan price. With that said.. I love the way they ask ME the prices what I would accept and 9 out of 10 they match what I ask. The staff are very friendly all the way down to the greeter/security officer at the door. I highly recommend<//Text>

I went in to this establishment looking for something in particular .  I was assisted by a very helpful associate ; I believe his name was Nickolas ? He was able to help me find a decent pair of earrings within my reasonable budget for my daughter ! I recommend this place .< /Text>

Great customer service, a larger selection of quality  jewelry then local jewelry shops. Rick was patient, knowledgeable and best of all he wasn't a high pressure salesman.  Will definitely return and do business here.<//Review>

<Review>I have been a customer there for a little while now and the reason being is as follows.  As soon as I get one foot inside, I’m greeted with a warm hello sir by their pistol carrying very nice and professional security, who makes sure that no one enters w/o their mask. Something all of us appreciates.  After that, each customer service person up to the manager iis guaranteed to give each customer the VIP treatment reguardless of race sex color or other. Then Platinum makes sure everyone leaves with the maximum amount everytime.  Each and every time. They have no competitors. It’s a win win win 4 everybody.  Platinum.< /Review>< pics>

Excellent service assistance.
They have many pieces of gold, silver and diamonds to choose from.  Will work with you with patience and understanding of your hearts desires.  Excellent layaway for 12 months if needed.
Thank you all. Highly recommended.  Returning soon.<//text></record>

He showed me a lot of different options that I had to trade in my jewelry for something else and I paid cash on top.. I was able to get something bigger and better as well!

1. The discount he gave me was more than generous and he explained all terms thoroughly.

2. I didn’t have to wait around for someone to walk me through each display case.

3. They have a comprehensive layaway plan, for those that don’t like spending a bunch at once.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Today was my first time visiting Platinum.  I was not in a very good mood walking in but left laughing and much happier.  From the greetings I received from the security guard who was very nice.  The place is spotless clean.  I was greeted by the nicest staff.  Mr. Gary took care of my transaction.   He was nice, friendly, and professional all at the same time.  He went above and beyond and did a favor for me also that no other pawn shop has done for me.  Great Job!  Thank you for the better mood and laughs.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_id>117786021065636440390< /user_id>< resp>

I had an issue to take care of and a gentleman by the name of Carlos answered the phone and helped me and took care of it right away. This guy was very helpful and courteous. Is nice to still find people in customer services that care about their customers. Great place to do business.<//review>

<review>Every time I come here it is always a good experience. Customer service is great too. They really know how to keep their cool when it comes to rude or upset customers. Security is always professional and on alert I never see him zoning out or fiddling with random things. Overall it’s a pretty good place to go to.<//review><Response>{'time': 1584392865564, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time to submit a review.

<text>The staff at Platinum makes this the #1 pawn shop in the AV. Victor and the rest of the guys, even the gentleman at the door, pushes Platinum above and beyond for all of your needs...and their prices are fantastic! This is my go to shop!

**Update: visited Tim today. He hooked me up. I am so happy with this pawn shop!! All of these guys are great. They are willing to make deals on purchases and don't have silly policies like Rick's. Platinum is the best!</text>< rating>

I just wanted to share that I really enjoyed my purchase. Victor took care of me very well. it's my second time purchasing a computer from them. I recommend you stop by anytime you need some electronics. It's my go-to spot. Thank God I haven't had the need to pawn anything but listening to the other customers who were there, it seemed like they were very happy with service.< /review>

<text>So today I came in to purchase some jewelry for me and my mom however my experience was HORRIBLE. The guy that was helping my boyfriend I overheard him telling him to come on with a better budget. LOL this man don’t know us from a can of paint. We have the money to buy WHATEVER we wanted out of there! We usually buy jewelry from them, but since they let our favorite guy go we DEFINITELY will not be going back!!!! 😘< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I just want to say thank you. you guys have always been extremely honest and fair with me, I've never once had a poor experience a platinum jewelry, and I know that there have been times where you bought stuff off of me and you didn't even want it! It's those times that I appreciate the most because that's what kept food in my children's mouths, so thank you and I tell everybody you won't get a better deal than a platinum jewelry< /review>

I had a really great experience I would recommend the store to my friends and family. The store had a big variety of stuff and the workers were really nice and helpful. They knew what they were talking about and especially the employee who helped me his name was Rafa he was such a big help in helping me to get my son an Xbox for his birthday. Rafa was really helpful and knew what he was talking about. Made my gift shopping way easier and highly recommend this place.</Text>

This establishment is outstanding! the employees are so nice and caring, one person I'd like to mention is " Danny " he helped me when i was late, he gave me a LONGG extension and calmed my nerves when i was in doubt. Platinum Jewelry is the place to go if you need great service.<//Review>

First time ever walking in to the store and I was surprised by their jewelry selection. A gentleman by the name of Rafael helped me find a nice necklace for my wife and gave me a great deal. I will definitely return before Christmas.< /review>

<Text>I have been going to Platinum jewlery & loan in Lancaster CA. For about 15 years now and I can honestly say I will not take my stuff to any other pawn shop! Fernando and the crew there are AWESOME, they all go above and beyond for their customers and do what they can to make you feel like family!!!! 👍

< Review>
Gary was awesome! He was very helpful , took his time teaching me about gold. I had never been into a pawn shop before but I was pleasantly surprised. I originally came in to sell all the gold and diamond jewelry I owened as I as many other have had difficulty making ends met. It's been difficult times in covid 19 for most of us. He noticed a particular item and he intuitably knew I had a special attachment to it. He suggested I pawn it instead. I've never pawned before but this was very smooth and easy to do. The idea that I  have a few months to get this back is very reassuring. After all was said and done I believe he was able to get me a great deal too.< /Review>

Wow, as always The Platinum Jewelry and Loan, CO for my Business transaction needs, be it loans or just buying some of the vast selection of inventory they carry. Today, Victor was my service person who helped me on obtaining necessary funds from an item I brought in. As well, Victor made a great deal with me on a Guitar that I bought. Victor was great and made sure I was happy with the purchase of the Guitar. enhanced my thoughts Of why I will continue to be a patron of the Platinum Jewelry and Loan Company. Very courteous, customer service driven.<//Review>

I was looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend and Rafael was very helpful. I know nothing about rings and he could have sold me any. He was nice enough to show me many rings and before I decided on one, he went into detail about the color a real diamond should be. He gave me tips on how to spot cheap and fake diamonds based on color and shape. He was knowledgeable, kind, and very respectful.<//Review>

I have been dealing with platinum jewelry home in Lancaster for several years they have never treated me wrong have always treated me right when I needed help and extending my loans or getting extra time to pay they were a great help and I've been a customer for well over. 4 to 5 years probably
maybe more all these guys are great they do a great job and I appreciate it very much thank you Jeff feigley<//review>

First and foremost, they helped my dad tremendously, who is struggling financially. My 76 year old father saw that he needed to pay yesterday, because he was in a panic about losing his beloved jewelry he immediately called and said he'd come in right away to pay what he owed (despite having hardly enough for food to last him to wednesday). I got the number and called back. I spoke to Zack and explained the state of panic my dad was in & what the situation was. Not only did he agree to extend it to the date I asked him (09/18/19), he did my dad a solid and said, “I’ll do you one better and extend it to 10/04.” It was kind and sympathetic. Because of his extension, I was able to to give Dad the good news, and he was SO RELIEVED! Secondly, not only was Zack amazing, but the security was kind, and every staff member I encountered was just great. Lastly, they have THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY there. I fell in love with a gold rosary, and the price was awesome. I’ve never dealt with pawn shops, just heard some rough stories...well folks, that won’t happen at Platinum Jewelry and Loan. Thanks again Zack & the entire Platinum Jewelry And Loan staff, you guys kick a**!!!< /Text>

<Review>When I visited Palmdale/Lancaster in June of this year, I needed a gift for my sisters 30th birthday. I thought jewelry would be nice so I stopped by Platinum. The staff was very helpful - especially Zach. He helped me find something I thought would be perfect for my sister and turns out he was right. She loved her gift! I’d recommend Platinum to anyone looking for good items at affordable prices.</Review>< rating>

< Review>
Complete 5 star experience. Platinum Jewelry & Loan is by far the best pawn shop in the Antelope Valley. No one beats their rates and also, their selection of jewelry, coins as well as guitars. Gary and the entire service staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and more than fair for when it comes time to make a deal (especially when compared to the competition).
And to top it all off- they even polished my diamond ring when I paid the ticket. Gary did a fantastic job on the ring and its never shined better. No one else in LA offers services like that. I highly recommend Platinum Jewelry and Loan especially, if you are in a tight bind like how I was. They will help and the store is an asset to the local community.

Thanks again Gary and Victor.</Review>

Platinum Jewelry has the best customer service. Unlike other well known pawnshops in Lancaster, they excel in treating their customers with courtesy and respect. The security man at the front door always greets everyone with a genuine hello. Best pawnshop in the A.V!!!<//Review>

I've been nothing but truly appreciative of the lengths that they've gone to help me and others out. My experience today with I believe his name is Tim was exactly the same. Very pleasant and helpful. Oh and I'd like to also shout out Gary and express that he is Awesome as well. Without him this moment today wouldn't have happened. KUDOS TO YOU ALL...</Review>< pictures>

I was shocked as soon I went  inside this place, customer service was excellent everyone was very helpful. Let me tell you, Gary made my wife’s dream come true. I went to at lot of places trying to make a custom wedding band for my wife’s ring. We were really sad because no one was able to help us in this situation as her engagement ring is a tear drop shape and our wedding was around the corner. We couldn’t find someone to make a custom band for my wife’s ring but luckily we found Gary. We explain to Gary what we wanted and right away he told us not to worry “ I will make your guys’ special day come true” I was really happy to hear that from Gary and I’m glad we went there after a week he gave us a call to get our ring and I was impressed by the excellent job he did thank you Gary and all you people there.< /Review>

Platinum jewelry and pawn is the best of shops I have ever been too. Jewelry and other products are in excellent condition. Staff there is great. Gary has helped me several times with purchasing and loans. I would definitely recommend going here for excellent quality of jewelry and customer service .

As long as they are in business, they have my business!!
GREAT  JOB!

Platinum Jewelry is a really great place to shop at, one person in general is Fernando, I didn't have the money but he gave me a long extension, i just wanna say, i would choose P.J&Loan inc. Over any jewelry store in Lancaster/Palmdale</text>

Update:: As usual, a great customer experience delivered! P.S. Raphael told me to tell you all he’s cute and awesome 😎😂😂 . JK - although Raphael and all these guys are friendly, polite, and consistently helpful.
If they were strippers, I’d pick a regular and make it rain 😂😂(joke)
Seriously though they’re the best! Go see Platinum..<//Text>

<text>Platinum Jewelry & Loan
Excellent customer service. I am a very satisfied customer. I like the fact they give you a good amount of time to pay back your loan, they give you a good interest rate, they even send you a courtesy letter If they are closed on they Day your loan is due they will extend it until the next day they are open & offer you to rewrite your loan so that you don’t lose your merchandise.
Platinum Jewelry & Loan would be my number one recommendation in the AV
Cool 😎 place to do business.</text>< Date>

I must say my experience at platinum with Mr. Gary was awesome. He is very experienced with Gold, I truly feel he was very fair with my purchase.  He was able to teach me a few things about gold. I’m greatful for his help. Thank You Mr Gary</Review>

I love Platinum Loans because they notify you by mail before your expiration date. They give you a chance to redeem yourself even if you go past the expiration date and they will work with you. I've tried other loan companies in the area, and platinum loans has the  friendliest customer service and policies.<//Review>

<text>I’ve been coming to platinum pawn shop for more than 7 years and always got treated like family ! All the workers are friendly and respectful and understanding. My favorite is Fernando. I purchase all my jewelry here and electronics I’ve never had any issues on anything I’ve purchased here. I recommend anyone looking to sale anything to come here< /text>< Pics>

As soon as I came in I was helped right away. I believe his name was Jeff, but I am not too sure about that. A tall guy who was very nice and patient as I looked for a necklace for my wife. I am really happy with what I got and will definitely be coming back< /review>

They have never let my family of 7 down. They always treat us like family and are super understanding. They dont ever try and low ball you for the items you brought in. I have been going here faithfully for over 6yrs me and my wife reccomend them to all in the antelope valley and surrounding areas....Ecspecially if you go to Rick's on Ave I, hit platinum I stead.<//Review>

The team at Platinum really go above and beyond with customer service. Gary did a great job with ensuring I was fully informed and satisfied. I will definitely recommend this business for any of your quality jewelry purchases. I look forward to doing business with them again.< /Text>

I came to them with a 10k gold class ring and they LIED and told me, "it was fake and stuck to their magnet." That is bad business! They should have said, "we are not interested in buying," but to tell a LIE is another thing. They are not trust worthy. Don't waist your time. Not a trustworthy group of people can do better else where.<//text>

Gary the jeweler at Platium pawn really took care of me. My wife lost the center diamond in her wedding ring and Gary replaced and basically made the ring brand new for half the price a jewelry store would charge. Thank you Gary yo made this ring look better than when I bought it!</review>

These people are fantastic! We called first to be sure items would be accepted.   My husband spoke to Gary on the phone to let him know I was on my way.  Gary reassured him I would be helped.   I arrived shortly before closing with a lot of items.  Gary reassured me all would be taken care of.   Fernando helped me take items out of the car and quickly and accurately wrote the docs.  As it was after closing, Ralphy lended a hand in logging in the items. These people work as a great team!  I left very pleased with the experience.   😊</text>

My family went through an extremely hard couple of weeks. We had a flood in our our house and were displaced for over 2 weeks in a hotel. Zack at the shop went above and beyond helping us out. He was not only fair, but he also treated us with respect and didn’t make us feel like we were worthless. It was our first time at a pawn shop, and zack took his time and explained the process of how it works. Deffinetly cheaper than taking a cash advance on our credit card. They are all very honest and very fair. I highly recommend if your in a bad spot and need some cash, you go see Zach and his crew. Can’t say enough good things about them. Helped us out in our time of need.<//Text>

<text>Best customer service I've ever received at a pawn broker. Purchased a projector and knew the gentleman from school so didn't have him test it. Got it home and it didn't work. Brought it right back and John troubleshooted it but couldn't get it right either with no hesitation gave me my money back. They take pride in good business and they will take good care of you.

<Review>They write the tickets in a way you think you owe so much by a certain date , but they charge you next month price , always finds a way to rip you off including splitting tickets , makes you think your saving but on 100 bucks you pay a extra 7.28 by splitting tickets just a real example . Always has to make the xtra few bucks burn the customer & smile & make you think its o.k. Anyway even some of their music equipment is way overpriced , they think because gold is their business , they have it . Plus I've been to a few shops and Platinum Jewelry  is one of few with a storage fee , and not cheap , it's actually the highest in the valley . So they give you 100 bucks for a 500.00 item , make you feel your item is worthless , that's why they can't lend you more , plus they use E Bay & Amazon to look up items and go by the lowest price for your loan . You paid 600 but sells on E Bay for 100 so we can only give a 50.00 loan B. S.  charge next month or highest fee to get item back , charge up to 10 plus bucks a month for storage,  ( they should store & Insure our items free for the prices we pay and being their customer the storage fee is what pissed me off the most ) . Then make you feel your wrong and act like their your best friends ... just a legal scam . Pawn shops were always shady , but not greedy like Platinum Jewelry . Also prob need security guard for them not the customers . I've seen more arguments and mouth offs etc in the few yrs I unfortunately had to do business with them  & all about money . Never again will I do business or go In there . I do ALL my business if I need to at Superior Pawn on Ave.I , check out George . Better loan prices , no storage fees small enough to be personal , big enough to lend big bucks . 👍 ... ( quick example I have a new 250 guitar w/a 120.00 case 25.00 cable 20.00 strap plus a 80.00 amp 495 in items got 100 loan from Platinum paid back 3 months 128.00 plus 10.00 month storage and tax ... Superior Pawn same stuff same loan paid back 119.00 no tax no storage where would you go , plus could have got 200 if I wanted it )... Cool people there they don't belittle you and care about their customers . Go where you like , but if you want the Best you have to find it . I did & it's not Platinum Jewelry . Thank You . Hope this helps someone ! ✌✌✌<//Review>< pictures>

I first went to a pawn shop around the corner from Platinum Jewelry & Loan . Although the people were nice I still had to wait a long time to be helped and left with my items because I was disappointed in their offer. I went to Platinum and received quick friendly service and got near top dollar for my items. Of course top dollar to me is more than you can get anywhere. I highly recommend this pawn shop and will visit them in the future.<//text>

I'm so Thankful that I chose Platinum Jewelry & Loan to do business with. Although I have been having extreme hardships in my own personal life and have been unable to recover my items that are in pawn I'm grateful to do business with Platinum because they always are very understanding when it comes to even working with you so that your items are not sold right away they are more than willing to extend you more days and give you more time to come in and pay the interest on your items if you can't get them out of Pawn... I personally want to Thank the whole Platinum team and Staff for giving me the opportunity to keep my valuable possessions with them in their care until I can redeem them back in the future..I've been going to them since 2014 and have never had any issues or even any losses.. Everyone there is always friendly polite and gives off an awesome vibe when you walk through there doors.. I personally no matter what time of day I go there I never see anyone walking out of their doors unhappy (Not Once).. No one can ever say anything wrong to me about this company or it's staff because my experience with them has always and will be always #1 in my book... They will always be my first choice if I need to do business.. Great Job well done..THANK YOU SO MUCH PLATINUM FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING KINDNESS WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY MYSELF.😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌ This is an continuing as of 5//21/2019 again Platinum has came through for me again this day with the help VICTOR GAVE ME TODAY WITH HIS OUTSTANDING KINDNESS HE CONTINUALLY GIVES ME.. COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER PLACE THAT HAS GONE TO SUCH GREAT LENGTHS TO ASSIST ME WITH HELPING ME SAVE THE ITEMS I HAVE IN PAWN SO THAT I DO NOT LOOSE THEM....COMMUNCATION IS KEY.< /Text>

Ok pawn shop. Work well with customers on the most part. But staff constantly switching up lately. I miss the old staff.😏😊. Ask for Tim  good customer service. I have heard of ppl &  including myself items being sold or missing parts before lending period is up. There growing. But when you pawn items you expect to get them back. I'll go again if Im able to work with a certain pawn broker.<//Review>

Shops in Palmdale are total rip off people giving about 10 - 20% of melt price on gold. Weigh your gold. Know the current price and these guys will work with you. Of course they low ball you that is the name of the game but they did meet my offer. I talk to Fernado or Damien. They are polite and kind people but yeah this is not a super friendly type of business. I have been twice and would go again if I needed to. Roomy and clean....I felt totally safe and even the parking lot is monitored so safe going in too...in daylight of course. Easy to find building....nothing else is that color anywhere near so just keep your eyes open.

Very few items for shopping...lots of jewelry though. No random crap everywhere or large musical instruments or stuff like that....I think there were some electronics but I was not there to shop.

The scale is not where you can see it so for you own peace of mind weigh it at home. Coins make good counter weights to get pretty close. Coin weights are standard and on line.</review>

One Of The Best Pawn Shops In Lancaster Victor Has Excellent Customer Service!!!!< /Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Review>Not only do these people give you top dollar for your items they also are personable enough to work out an extension for you if you find yourself needing one!The other pawnshops in the area cheat you  first of all by taking advantage of your situation.They give you or offer you the lowest and most offending price.If you accept the offer and later find out that you just lost your valuables for being a day late and not only that, you lost it for chump change!OUCH!!.My very first experience at Platinum Jewelry & Loan had me leaving there telling myself that I will never use the other three pawnshops again!I was very impressed with their professionalism and personable manner! But mainly that they gave me more than I was asking for or expected to receive for my valuables!! And check with them first if you're looking for used quality electronics such as laptops etc, ! I've purchased three!!< /Review><user>108974995044408945380< /user>< rate>

<review>never going back ... biggest rip in town . they charge the most storage fees and some places dont even charge a storage fee , just another way to get a few bucks from you . we bring our stuff to them help them stay in business and they charge us to store our pawned items ... and price from e-bay . now i go buy a guitar just to say , i paid 400 , they run 400 but e-bay has one for 100 so they loan you 50 if lucky , and if unfortunate enough not to pick up your item you can bet they will sell it for top dollar , try to make a good deal ... see what happens ... thats no way to do business running yours by another companies pricing ... what really gets me is they dont know about any value of anything unless they can weight it or find it on e-bay . i couldnt get a loan once because my item wasnt selling on e-bay ... like i said what a rip . plus they make you feel special while they laugh as you leave (ive seen it and they make fun of customers too,i know ,,, i had a fake laugh with them once when they made fun of a customer) I PROMISE I will NEVER go back there no matter how hard up i get for cash and if i do ill go to SUPERIOR PAWN on Ave I George is great , their small enough to be personable and familiar with their customers and big enough to pawn high dollar jewelery , plus theve even taken my whole drum set once ,now their cool hey no storage fees ..... . im not happy with Platinum Jewelry ... !!! ... (THIS ISNT A BAD REVIEW FOR REVENGE THIS IS A BAD REVIEW CAUSE THATS HOW IVE BEEN MADE TO FEEL AND MY 5 YR EXPERiENCE DEALING WITH THEM THANKS FOR READING)<//review>< Name>

Amateur rip off scammers who try to take advantage of your misfortune. One guy offers me $20 for diamond white gold earrings and after i told him he must be stupid and asked for another person to help me i was then offered $150 which i refused because i would rather not deal with scum. Everybody does not get high so if your looking for help in a time of need this is not the place!!!</review>
