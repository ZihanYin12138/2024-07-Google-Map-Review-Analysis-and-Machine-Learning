They were so wonderful with my fur baby hamilton, the doctor was so helpful in giving me all the details of what was happening with my dog via phone and so kind when I asked questions. The vet assistant was also extremely kind and helpful in breaking down cost, which might I add was way less than I was expecting. I left knowing my dog was going to be okay. 10/10 would recommend thank you so much for the amazing experience!< /Text>

< review>
First visit. Got me in quickly. Took great care with Bella , my Pomeranian. Update: Bella was a very sick girl this week. I brought her in for evaluation. They thoroughly checked her over. Fussed over her. Loved on her. Discussed her eating, drinking and behavioral changes. Honestly, more thorough than my physician. Waiting on lab results for a final diagnosis. But, the IV has kick started her recovery.</review>

<review>I love this place because my dogs love these people. They step up and beyond customer service in my opinion. They have seen, and helped us let go, of numerous pets over the past several decades. From puppies and kittens to seniors averaging 16 years, they have helped all of our pets live long happy lives.< /review>< pictures>

I was really saddened when I found out the Vet who has taken care of all of my pets over the past 25 years had left.  I recently had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Stewart who has shown such compassion for my sweet lab.  He is helping me through a difficult time for which I am very grateful.< /Review>

< Review>
This place is a complete joke. I took my 10 week old puppy in for his 10 week puppy shots and a fecal test. I sat in the car while my puppy was in the clinic for over 1 hour in 90 degree heat. I told the vet I DID NOT WANT A LEPTO vaccine. It is dangerous and not necessary. The vet insisted I had to have the Lepto vaccine and said it was actually in the DHPP vaccine so I had no choice anyways. He then told me my puppy could not have his DHPP shots as it did not align to the vets 12 week schedule and that I have to come back in 2 weeks. I called 3 times requesting the fecal results. The receptionist told me they had other cudtomers and they'd call me back. I said "Oh I guess I am not an important customer since I already paid you." I was told that I would receive a call back with the results later that day. It's been over 10 days. I guess it's ok if my puppy dies from worms while waiting for the vet to call. Don't go. Don't get LEPTO. You'll regret it. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.< /Review>

< review>
Advance Care Veterinary Hospital is pricey but it is because they are very THOROUGH. I’ve been to many vets and even out of city, and none has been as thorough as this veterinary hospital.

I currently have 6 dogs and 4 of them have been neutered only here. Any other surgical things that needed done was also done here. And all the outcome of that surgery procedures have been 100% the best, this is because no implications appear afterwards. And this is because they thoroughly make sure they have analyze everything  of your little one so that they don’t miss a single thing. And because they don’t miss a single thing, I don’t need to comeback the next day or week because my dogs look and feel better.

I recently just moved to Murrieta, California, a 1.5 hour drive away from here. And so I started scouting for another veterinary hospital to be loyal to. I went to high review lower cost vet near where I am currently living and thought why not. After they have diagnosed my little one Ace, they gave him a prescription of antibiotics, Benedryl and an eye ointment all for $225. I thought to myself what a deal!

Then the next day hits and something about the medicine did not feel right, and so I realized that I forgot to mention that the house was being treated outdoors for rat poison (in San Diego where I visit my home to do checkup)  in which he might have ingested. To which the vet from Murietta replies to me, “Even if he ingested rat poison we would not change a thing to his prescription and we will wait for a week to determine whether or not to change it”. Within that day I called them 4 to 5 times urging to do a blood analysis in which should have been a priority in the beginning, but my persistence finally let Ace in and did a blood analysis. To find out there was rat poison in his system. And that they added something in his prescription, a Vitamin K1, which is a vital anecdote for his survival. If I had waited for a week for Ace’s checkup , he would have been a goner..

Well I came back for a blood analysis, I was charged $275 at the Murrieta Vet. So for that 2 day time frame I have spent more than $500 on that vet alone and a total of 7 hours waiting and calling just to have prevented this kind of issue in the first place.

So although I spend more money here, I spend less time in this vet in general. They do such amazing examination/analysis in the first place that you did not need to come back at all, because they will make sure to fix it here and now.

And although I live 1.5 hours away, I called this vet to ask their opinions in Ace’s situation and they immediately told me to send them photos of Ace , in which the busy doctor immediately responded to my email and said to take Ace to the nearest emergency hospital in (murrieta).

This hospital is the best. They will make sure that everything is prevented before it escalates further. And even if that means paying more , in the end of the day they will analyze your little one more than any vet and will make sure no implications occur further.

I don’t care if I live 1.5 hours away, I’ll make sure to only go to them.

Thank you for taking care of my dogs!

Best regards,
Mary and Alyssa (Ace, Hunter, Crater, Ollie, Finn, and Bella)</review>

I was recently referred to Dr. Perry at the practice through a friend and she is AMAZING! Although my dog had a vet and back up vet already in San Diego, Dr. Perry has become our absolute favorite and is going to be our first choice whenever my dog has any issues. My dog has developed recent panic attacks/anxiety and we could not figure out a solution or pinpoint what caused her recent change in behavior. Dr. Perry is extremely thorough, listens very carefully, and is very detailed with her diagnosis and suggestions. What I love about Dr. Perry is she is the first vet I have found that will stay in the room as long as she needs to without making the patient feel like she has to rush out. Her quality, personality, and expertise are excellent and we could not be happier. She is quick to call the patient back and help over the phone to address anything that comes up after the appointment as well. She always seems to take that extra step in your animal's care and I love it. By far out of all my experiences she is the best vet in San Diego! Thank you Dr. Perry and staff for following up after visits and for taking great care of Ginger :)<//review>

<text>I called & was able to get an appointment same day for my cat Bubbles who had never been there before.  This helped relieve the worry of waiting days or even weeks to get my girl seen. The entire staff were all so friendly and amazing and handled  Bubbles as if she was their baby. Dr. Sbardellati spent so much time with us and never once acted rushed. She explained everything in detail which reassured me my girl was getting the best care. The medications that came home with us have amazing instructions and not just a simple 1 line leaving you to guess. The vet tech also went over all of this to make sure I was confident in administering them all. I received a call next day checking to see how she was doing. Amazing staff who obviously love their jobs and animals. I would recommend them to everyone in a heartbeat.<//text><user_id>105845501481111314788</user_id><Response>{'time': 1573132559390, 'text': "Hi Lynn, thank you for the wonderful review!

< Review>
I absolutely love this place!! Two days ago, I brought my dog, Cody, for a second opinion to see if he needs a surgery to remove his dead skin which caused by a car accident. I personally prefer holistic medicine and want to avoid the surgery. I thought my dog was doing so well, so when Dr. Vibert told me that Cody needs a surgery to remove the dead skin ASAP,  I had hard time to accept.  Dr. Vibert was really patient with me and explained clear why Cody needs to have the surgery ASAP. I took time to think through. Then, I made the decision to go with surgery. What I grateful for Dr. Vibert and the team is that they really care! Seriously REALLY care!! I can say that Dr. Vibert and the team are the angels that God sent to me to help me, my family and Cody go through this tough situation. Everyone I encountered in this hospital was very friendly and kind. Dr. Vibert went all out to help Cody. She is an amazing doctor who truly care for her patients as her family. I strongly recommend her to everyone who has fur baby.< /Review>

< Review>
My dog Legend had a cancerous growth on his eye which Dr. Gordon had removed several years ago.  My other dog died of spinal cancer.  I take meticulous care of my pets, feed them a raw frozen diet, supplements and take them to the vet when they are sick.  My pets are part of our family.  On December 23, right before all the vets were shutting down before the XMAS holiday, I discovered a red bleeding growth on Legend's paw.  I know all about bone cancer and was completely shook up.  I found it at night and immediately emailed Dr. Gordon with photos. Knowing Legend's history and my love for him, he got back to us right away and by 8 am the next morning, Legend was in for surgery.  The staff was wonderful and very caring.  It turned out Legend's tumor was benign (which is a miracle) and Dr. Gordon had emailed us this fantastic news on Christmas day!  It's hard to know whether to trust reviews but our family has been a patient of Dr. Gordon's for many years and have been to many veterinary hospitals.  He is very concerned about making sure clients and their pets receive the best in customer service and veterinary care.  If you ever have a concern, you can always just let him know.  Highly recommend him!< /Review>

I've been a pet owner for more than 50 years, and Dr. Haley is the best vet I've ever worked with. Currently I have a rescue cat with chronic issues that plagued him over 5 years, which several other vets couldn't address (and actually made worse). Dr. Haley was able to resolve those issues through her expertise, perseverance, and willingness to listen and partner with me. On top of that, she clearly cares more about her patients than making a profit. She offers as much time as needed at each appointment, and has quickly responded to multiple emails, even on weekends and holidays. Other staff members I've encountered have been friendly and helpful as well. I highly recommend this clinic.</review>

<review>We chose Advanced Care Veterinary Hospital because of their excellent reviews from happy clients, their AAHA accreditation (few veterinary hospitals achieve this) and because they offer a RATTLESNAKE VACCINE which I didn't even know was an option until I started reading about their practice. We come across snakes every summer, so this is going to give us a lot of peace of mind should we ever have an unfortunate bite occur. (It buys you time to get your pet to treatment, doesn't prevent ) The tech Paige and Dr. Vibert were very professional and helpful, the office is pleasant and clean and I'm happy to have found a practice that I think is going to be a good fit for regular care and treatment for my dog.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We have used Dr. David Gordon for our huskies over the last 10 years and he has taken excellent care of them.  The service is excellent and he always gets us in when we have had an emergency.  He is very knowledgeable and responds very promptly to any of our questions.  Great veterinary care and we highly recommend him!<//Review>

You won't find a more caring group of veterinarians than at Advanced Care in Poway.  I wish my personal doctors showed me the same level of interest and concern as these doctors do for my cat.  We don't live very close, and we pass other veterinarians to get to Advanced Care and you should too.</Review>

I was very pleased with the attention and care that Rose provided for my 11 year old Pom. She was very thorough with the exam and provided clear advice on how to care for my dog. It seems like they are a busy clinic so the wait can be a little long, but overall the vet and staff was very kind and caring.< /Text>

<review>We have been taking our dog here since he was a puppy. They always do a great job taking care of our dog no matter what the issue is and pricing is very reasonable. Our most recent emergency was a fox tail in our dogs ear. He was seen by Dr. Perry and had the fox tail out that same morning. Dr. Perry treated him like her own. Will be coming here for years to come.<//review>< Pics>

When we were unable to get a Saturday afternoon appointment with our cat's regular vet, ACVH fit us in within 2 hours of our call even though they'd never seen our cat before.  Dr. Rose and the staff was very caring and worked hard to try and figure out what was causing our cat's illness.  What they did helped him and they gave us instructions on how to care for him over the rest of the weekend. They will be seeing him again on Monday to follow-up.</text>

Dr. Perry is such a heart centered veterinarian. She has helped me through a grave illness of one of my cats and never gave up on trying different approaches to alleviate his symptoms. Being an AAHA accredited veterinary hospital is important to me as a pet owner. It raises the bar on stringent requirements and the facility and staff must be recertified every three years. This vet practice from the office staff, to the technicians, to the veterinarians is totally pet centered, customer focused, and heart based.

David Gordon has been my veterinarian since 2001, and I have complete confidence in him and his staff. I'm sure he will bring the excellent quality he has shown to my pets and I at his Orange County facility to bear in Poway. I can't think of anyone I would trust more with my dogs. He has seen me through cancer, heart issues, lung issues, cyanosis, and other ailments and has never left me feeling unappreciated or ignored. I really love that he will discuss all avenues of treatment with me and explain, in language I understand, what is happening with my dogs.< /review>

I am very protective of my 4 legged children and this Vet office is wonderful.  It is clean and does not smell horrid.  The staff seems to love animals and try to make the animal feel less stressed.  The Doctor was very gentle with my Puli.  They give a follow up call which is great, I can ask questions.  This Vet is further from our home than many other Vets here in Mira Mesa.  They smell so bad I cannot sit and wait for an hour for my Puli to be seen.  If that makes me gag, I cannot imagine what Krumpli is going through.  ACV seems clean.<//text>

<review>The people were very friendly, but the prices are ridiculous! Wanted to charge me almost $100 just to fill out a form to take my dog on a day long vacation to Mexico. When I said No Thank You, they called me back less than 5 minutes later to lower the price by half.  Then found out I dont even need it! Not very good customer service in my opinion.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I don't have any specific stories to share, just an overall, every-single-time, glowing review. I'm very particular about my dogs' care, to the point that some would call me fanatical, and I'm extremely particular about their veterinarian.

That said, I trust Advanced Care Veterinary Hospital implicitly and will never go anywhere else as long as I live in San Diego. Dr. Gordon and Dr. Halsey, with whom I've had the most experience, are competent, compassionate, and extraordinarily attentive. They genuinely care for the pets they treat, and unlike a lot of veterinarians I have encountered over the years, they really do listen to you, as your pet's best friend and greatest advocate, to come up with a comprehensive approach to care that includes both traditional and holistic therapies. Even saying they go "over and above" is an understatement.

I've never felt pressured at Advanced Care, their costs are very reasonable, and the clinic staff is fantastic, as well. Amazing!</review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>Brought my dog here for a check up and they not only tried to get me to pay for unnecessary treatment, but they over-charged my bill. They gave me an estimate and without explaining the increased charges, they tried to charge me more.

Be sure to double check your bill when you come here. This is a typical vet that knows people will pay whatever for their pets.

They also told me my dog needed expensive dental work because her teeth would begin to hurt her soon. My dog lived another 3 years with no teeth pain whatsoever.

Whatever they prescribe, get a second opinion.< /review>< pics>

Well were do I start off, I had my girlfriend go for the routine of dog check ups and so forth so they needed a sample of the poo poo so she stuck her finger up his butt, when my girlfriend came home my dog butt was swollen bright Red! I did not know what this was I figured it was normal maybe he would be okay the next day or so. Not at all his problem got worse he started yelling from the top of lungs screaming while he is boo booing..I told my girlfriend and we could not figure this out so I took him to the vet again 1,000 later he is still screaming its awful I feel like I may need to down my dog because he is suffering. This Vet did nothing for me, Even one of the vet lady after words even said why did you not bring him to us the day after, I'm like what? We are here Now worried!!  I told  her this was the Second time I'm in your office with this issue you  started. So I do not advise this clinic, NO not at all.<//review>

< review>
Meeting Dr. Outterson for the first time today was a little intimidating for me as I strolled in with the weight of the world on my shoulders worried that the growth on my pet’s face might end up being a cancerous tumor. Having not dealt with him before, I was worried he wouldn’t have the right kind of experience to handle a pug-nosed breed, as well as an over-protective, paranoid owner! How I was wrong!

He listened patiently as I rambled on about my concerns regarding the lump on her face and the redness of her skin, and took into account every spot that I pointed out to him that I thought something was wrong. He treated Beep very kindly and gently, allowing her to remain relaxed during the examination, and used a variety of techniques that showed extensive knowledge of pug-nosed breeds so he could accurately give a diagnosis. The way he broke down the treatment options the way he said he would have handled his own pets as a dog owner as well. Most vets that you deal with have a detachment from their “patients” and will give you a clinical diagnosis only, while Dr. Outterson took into account the emotional attachment people get to their animals and what treatments would not only be best for the animal but best for the owner too. No one likes to think of their animal in pain or discomfort, so his concern about making sure we were both comfortable with the treatment plan was comforting.

Dr. Outterson even took time out of his schedule to proceed with an on-the-spot biopsy of the tissue and gave me a great deal of relief as he and the other members of the staff reviewed the tissue and told me there were no abnormalities. Beep and I can both breathe easy tonight and look forward to our further dealings with Dr. Outterson.

Advanced Care Veterinary Hospital has always been our go-to vet because of their friendly staff and knowledgeable vets, and I would recommend them and Dr. Outterson for any pet owner.< /review>

< Review>
Amazing experience! After a long week of moving and unpacking the last thing I wanted to do was shop for a bed. However a friend of mine recommended this place and it was well worth it to stop by. From the moment we entered the shop we were greeted. There was an enormous selection in store not to mention the ability to order from catalog. The staff was so helpful And friendly. I couldn’t imagine shopping anywhere else for furniture. They have it all and they deliver. Can’t beat that.<//Review>

<Date>1607829207502<//Date><pictures>None</pictures><Review>I received INCREDIBLE service from Love Haight Computers for a LCD display replacement for my late 2013 MacBook Pro 15” retina laptop. I get anxious anytime I have to take my laptop in for a repair, but from the start they made me feel comfortable placing my laptop in their care. I received a prompt response to my service inquiry online and they had a “like new” refurbished LCD display with which to replace my shattered one. I am a full-time graduate student with a very busy work schedule so it’s difficult to go without my laptop for several days. Not only did Love Haight Computers offer me a cheaper repair option with the refurbished LCD display, they replaced my screen within just a few hours! I am so appreciative of the team and all that they did to get my computer working again, and with such a fast turnaround! This refurbished screen works amazingly, so happy that I came to Love Haight Computers. Will continue going there for all my repair needs!<//Review><gmapID>0x808580a6cc645d4d:0x9b8b8dad3cdf4204< /gmapID>< userid>

DO NOT GO HERE. Actively aggressive, rude employee named James. Terrible attitude. If could give zero stars I would. Brought MacBook Pro in to replace battery, they returned it with a non-Apple OEM battery (despite assurance they would use Apple) and only partially charged. Gaslighted and blamed me for their shoddy work. Waste of time, money. Read the other bad reviews.< /Text>

The staff will work with you and do whatever they can to get you into a machine that fits your budget. Being a broke student whose previous MacBook was stolen, the owner helped me find a laptop that fit my budget and saved an entire semester of school. I will ALWAYS be grateful and bring any computer needs and repair issues to Love Haight Computers first. I recommend this shop to all of my colleagues, and if you haven't visited, you should stop by and let them win your business themselves - you won't be disappointed!<//Review>< pictures>

I went in to get my battery on my Mac pro replaced. They weren't sure how long it might take but to come back in an hour. I returned in 45 minutes and they had it done. They even attached new rubber feet to the bottom of my computer for 10 bucks! Awesome service, friendly people, highly recommend.</text>

Azm has taken care of me and my computer woes for the past three years.  I love that Love Haight Computers has a personal, non-corporate vibe.  They are always super fast with their turn around and have reasonable prices.

Things I have had done-  RAM upgrade, hard drive information transfer, screen replacement and battery replacement.

Also, Azm knows that I am an artist and always cleans my dust/paint smother computer!<//review>

review. These guys just rock ! Super accommodating and informative. Still singing their praises!

They are into helping you keep whatever computer you've got running. Brought in a 2010 laptop. Downtown at another computer store their answer was get a new one. Love and Haight fixed my computer and at avery low cost respectively.
Thank You. Will be sending you as much business as possible.< /Text>< pics>

Great staff. Very knowledgeable and friendly. A little pricy, but totally worth it. Also they are 95% Mac focused here, meaning they don't really have much in the way of PC/Android. It's mostly a repair shop, not a computer supply or parts store. I feel some reviews and results on Yelp/Google/maps/ask are kind of misleading​ about Love Haight Computers</Text>

<Review>Wish I could give no star.

PLEASE DON'T EVER GO TO LOVE HAIGHT COMPUTER.
PLEASE GO TO APPLE STORE FIRST BEFORE YOU GO TO THIS PLACE.
First of all, this isn't my first time at this place. I used to trust them, but not anymore.

My MacBook stopped working. Because of having gone here before, I thought I should just go here again because Apple store is official and likely to be "expensive", but turns out, APPLE STORE IS WAY CHEAPER.

LHC diagnosed and told me my laptop is helpless. It will cost $900 to fix or get a "refurbished used" one. Due to how disappointing it is, I decided to go to Apple store and find out what they say. BUT LHC CHARGED ME $200 for diagnostic still.

Apple Store charged nothing for diagnostic or transferring data on this computer. More importantly, they told me they can fix it for LESS THAN $500.

Obviously, I wasted $200 at LHC for nothing. And they were trying to trick me into giving them my fixable computer and taking something that is likely older or worse from them for $900.

NO WAY. PLEASE DON'T EVER GO TO LOVE HAIGHT COMPUTER.</Review><Date>1544216131146< /Date></record>

There location is prime, central, but still with tons of parking.  They were so cool, easily diagnosing the problem, trouble shooting for an easy fix and casually telling me my options if I want to upgrade to fix the problem in the long run.  Despite spending a good 30 minutes with me, they didn't charge me a dime.  I will be back with any future IT needs! These guys are great.

Recieved used computer from there as a gift. Needed several pricey repairs, until they finally agreed to swap my computer out for a comparable one. They smiled the whole time that they gouged me for repairs the second one needed from day one, switched my computer out for the previous lemon with the last repair. Their dog is really cool.</Review>

<date>1359705175389</date><Text>This place is incredible -- I have tons of love for Love Haight computers. A few months ago I bought the new MacBook Air and later realized I didn't really have any use for it. Worried it wasn't worth my while to take a loss on the sale, I was amazed when Love Haight offered me close to what people are selling their Macs for on Craigslist. Another perk is I didn't have to deal with emailing a bunch of strangers and arranging a sale. I looked at other online services for MacBook Air buybacks and found the offers to be way too low based on what I originally paid. Love Haight offered me way more money and gave me the choice of receiving cash or a check. In addition, I didn't have to deal with shipping my computer, which made the process so much easier.

Prior to my most recent visit my iPhone screen cracked. I took it to Love Haight and they fixed it within 30 minutes for less than it would've cost anywhere else. They're completely worthy of the 5-star review. If I ever have any tech issues, it's pretty clear who my #1 choice is in SF.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>My friend referred me and I'm so glad I went! My laptop was stollen :( and I needed an affordable replacement. Going in for a referbished Mac was way easier than scrolling through all the options online. I hate online shopping for big purchases! The guys over at Love Haight are awesome, friendly, knowledgable, trustable, and made computer buying SUPER easy. They found me a machine in my budget and added the extra RAM I needed in just a few minutes. Thanks so much, my computer is the BOMB and I feel secure with the 1 year warranty. Love Haight, you all will be my computer guys for life <3<//text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The seller was totally ignorant about computers and how to sell, at one point I've asked about the specifications of two computers and he told me that first I have to choose the equipment that i wont and after he tell me the specification T-T (How does he want a choice if I only know the serial number of the product?!?). Bad seller and expensive equipment equal bad shop.< /review>

<Text>During  the pandemic, I had visited the Montclair Plaza store twice wearing a bandana face covering.  The associates were kind, helping me find the product I needed.  Last week I visited for the third time (May 2021) and was kindly, but immediately told I had to wear a paper mask that they provided because my bandana (I guess) was not good enough.,  The cashier was wearing a paper mask and gloves.  My bandana provides just as much protection as your ill-fitting paper masks, and unless the cashier constantly changes gloves after touching every single item, she is cross-contaminating everything, and now we know the covid virus is  not transmitted via  surfaces, nor do the viruses survive long on surfaces.   This is pure ridiculous, virtue-signaling theater.  Please - knock it off.< /Text><rate>2<//rate>< GmapID>

Amazing staff and cosmetics. They also do free 15 minute makeup which is you pick between eyes, lips, foundation and concealer, bows, or contoring and they will teach you how to do it. The also have a full face makeover which cost $50 plus whatever you buy.</text>

I love coming to Sephora but whenever I come I always have a hard time figuring out my shade preferably because there are no women of color here and everytime they match my shade they match it to my hyperpigmentation... fair warning if you are a women or men of deeper complexion please try and find a Sephora that has people like that because the women here know nothing about undertones ... I also had a bad experience with a Spanish-speaking worker who was talking about me in Spanish but didn't realize that I speak Spanish as well</review>

Staff was rude when the store wasn't even that busy. I had one black girl follow me around the store like I was stealing. Everywhere I went she was standing right by me. I asked for a certain brand and she came back with a rude response making me feel stupid for not knowing something about a brand when I myself don't wear makeup. Second time I've come to this location and no help whatsoever.< /text>

My daughters and I love to come here and play with our faces.  The workers are always attentive and friendly offering samples when I need them and ive always had very easy,  hassle free returns the rare times ive had to during the holiday season.  Definitely an A plus in my book.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I love the variety and the empolyees are very helpful and knowledgeable, however 4 star because if you need something they dont spend much time with you one on one which I like when it comes to this kind of shopping. I also believe this is more of a coorporate policy< /review>< pictures>

No one would help and checking out was a hit or miss and they even told me that if I didn't pay with a card with my name on it, my mother was buying me something, then I couldn't get my points or my rouge discounts. At any Sephora location from having my rouge for the past 4 years I've never had a cashier tell me this . And when I complained to corporate the store emailed me and I responded only to not receive a response back. Not to mention there was no apology in the email for how rude the cashier was only them telling me to read company policy. But in the end I was still wasting my money I honestly don't see why a store would refuse to sell to someone they ignored to begin with. It was off putting I didn't want anything but an apology in return.  I'd much rather make the drive out to the Sephora in Chino or Rancho or stick to online where they would never refuse a customer just trying to pay for their items.</Text>< pictures>

<date>1513570962072< /date><rate>1</rate><Text>I had a very negative experience in the Montclair Mall Upstairs Location.

THE REPRESENTATIVES INVOLVED:
- Francesca & Floor manager

It all started when we approached Francesca, the floor representative, she was initially rude and very unapproachable, her tone of voice and unwillingness to help made me very uncomfortable. I wanted to leave the store because of how discouraged I felt but I didn't, I stayed and I keep led browsing.

It wasn't until she kept following me and watching me as if I was going to steal something that I decided that this was no longer tolerable. I immediately put all the products down and decided to leave the store.

As soon as I walked out, I decided that I wasnt going to leave things the way they were, I decided to come back inside and approach management.

When I initially approached the floor manager, she refused to give me the store number and the representative who helped me. It wasn't until I asked her again that she said her name. I wanted her name to complain to corporate about my negative experience.

However, us as consumers must know and identify where our services and presence are valued. I left the store and I went to the one inside JCPenny where I received wonderful service from a very friendly staff.

I will not be visiting the Montclair location, I will take my business where I feel valued.<//Text>< Pics>

THE STAFF IS INCREDIBLY RUDE. I went there to return a foundation that i bought there a couple days before I returned it because it looked like It had been used and had been put back on the shelve to be sold. And the lady would only give me store credit for it when I paid in cash. I pointed out that it said right on my receipt that i had paid cash for it and she said she couldn't give me cash back because it had been used. I have returned many foundations that I had used from different sephoras and they have always gave me my full amount back to however I paid. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager was the same way rude! I ended up just taking the store credit but I will definitely not be returning to this sephora. They don't even deserve the one star.</Review>

Bad customer service,  the lady was talking to a customer about her bleached hair. Nothing makeup related and when I asked for help, one of the other girls just told me to wait for the other sephora girl and just left because she was probably going home or something.</text>

<Text>Very disappointing customer service. We purchased some kids walkie talkies for our seven year old from the Books Inc toy section. The walkie talkies were extremely low quality and did not work at all as advertised. When I tried to return the product (within 14 days, with receipt as advertised) I was told these products were not returnable as they had been opened. Any decent store will take back products if the customer is not happy with the quality of the product. I expect better from Books Inc, but the end result is it's harder to support local stores when they don't offer reasonable return policies<//Text>< Pics>

This place is so cool. They have Indy books you can’t just find anywhere. I recommend Harvest Moon, which you can find right next to Harry Potter. It was an amazing love story!!!<//Review>

I was impressed they were even carrying my favorite "The Sun" mag with no advertising only art and heartfelt writing!  Bravo!
I was searching for a book they ran out of and were able to order me it to arrive a few days later and called to remind me to pick up! Great Service, Friendly Staff and  Great Section of Recommendations of their Favorite Books from the Staff with their personal review!  Thanks< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is a book lover's and writer's dream. It's a wonderful little book store with something for everyone that is organized yet welcoming and encourages you to wander in wonder. The owners/managers encourage and support local authors with frequent book readings. Being new to California, I am happy to say that I have found myself a new home away from home.</text>

Books Inc staff is efficient and ready to help with orders, holds, and recommendations - I love the personal staff recommendation notes under books for sale in the store, and every conversation I've had with staff has been pleasant - they've been forward with helping you find a book and prompt to explain ordering status of each book. The store is clearly organized and it's clear the staff love their work!<//review>

My boys enjoy checking out the book in children's reading corner. I love buying gifts here , all because of wrapping services. They make most effort to make lovely wrapping. Love the choices of wrapping paper, saves time for the birthday gift shopping. They have reading environment to reading. Their story time is worth going.</Text>

<text>I bought one book there today.  Very helpful — with just a close approximation of the exact title, she walked right to where it was and handed me a copy, and now I have a new book!  And I very seldom add more books to my library; they have to be choice good ones.  Very nice bookstore.< /text>< rate>

< review>
They charged me all of quarantine shut down when they were closed until my card expired. When I called about my credits at the end of February they said I had 90 days to use my credits from February 1st. So really it was only 60 days. When I asked the guy on the phone for an appointment he told me they were booked out for the next 2 weeks. I enjoyed this place until this situation. Never again.<//review>

<Text>I think I prefer privately owned massage places. While I appreciate the super professional attitudes and cleanliness of this place, I didn't love the hard sales pitch at the end. The massage was also very technical - pretty impersonal. I prefer a massage therapist that I work with over time and is able to really work on my tough areas and make progress and give me individualized attention. There was also an unnecessarily long and invasive form to fill out ahead of time, and they asked me questions when I got there that I already answered on the form. I know I'm being really picky here. I think most people would give this place 5 stars, I just prefer the more personal attention of an independently owned practice.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<username>Nicole Atkinson<//username><Time>1609713090839<//Time><rating>2< /rating><review>My husband booked me a 50 min massage as a gift for me. I have visited many different spas. This is one that I would not recommend. Although the staff was friendly, the place does not have a warm, relaxing vibe. The masseuse did not sound very confident, which made me uncomfortable. When we got into the room the lights were on and bright. It looked like a room in the doctors office. He did not turn off the lights until after he had lifted the sheets I was under. Overall, he did a good job with the massage, I just wish I could have felt more comfortable in this environment, given this is a place you come to relax.< /review>< Pics>

The staff here are so kind and welcoming. The detail they put into everything and making sure your completely comfortable is amazing. Communication was easy to understand and talked about every step along the way to make sure you fully understood what was going on. All the products they use were amazing and smelt so good and enhanced the relaxation.<//review>

Warning to all who have a membership. They have been closed due to COVID-19 for months and just reopened. They had the audacity to charge my credit card for three months worth of services for months they were closed. They sent me a text message a few hours before charging me saying they would resume charging but never said they would charge for the months they were closed. I now have five sessions worth of credits and am not comfortable using their services during this pandemic. I will be canceling today.

They promptly responded when they opened at 9:00 am and refunded my account. That’s good customer service.<//Text>

Went and had a couple’s massage done. With both of our schedules being very busy, it was nice that they had later appointment available on weekends. The massage experience and atmosphere were very relaxing. My massage therapist did a great job, she applied great pressure and did some wonderful stretches that really helped me feel more relaxed. My partner also enjoyed his massage. Definitely will be coming back to this location!</review>

Best place to go for a massage or facial or any other service they provide. Extremely professional. Always feels like a positive place to go! I always feel great after Evaghn's massage or Merissa's facials. I LOVE this place. I never knew I needed spa days until I came here! Even got my mom hooked on it. Definitely recommend.< /review>

Purchased gift certificate massages on my account when they had a sale. Booked a massage and told them I was going to use one of the gift certificates. They confirmed that they could see the certificates on my account had not been redeemed. After the massage was told that as I had missplaced the paper certificate even though they could see on the account that I had purchased certificates which had not been redeemed; their policy had changed and they would not honor or refund the certificates. ( I have 3 unused certificates).  I feel ripped off. I will no longer be doing business with them. Would not recommend.</text>

This was my my first massage. I was nervous, didn’t know what to expect. Maribel was so sweet, she really did make me feel comfortable. She focused on my back by request, it hurt a bit not because of the pressure but because I think I have a pinched nerve. But she did everything to make me feel comfortable and at ease. The next day I woke up feeling amazing! My back wasn’t “tight” anymore. Definitely recommend and definitely coming back.<//text>

<text>My Massage Therapist, Martin, was profound!!  Everything was on point, pressure, attention to back tension, technique, professionalism, and he has a vibrant personality.  The daily physical stress which was hindering my energy levels, is almost gone!!  I am confident that my energy levels will increase with a few more massages, since I have not had one for over a year.  I can't express how great I am feeling, with just this one massage!  I am definitely looking forward to release of all my back tension.  Thank you, Martin for your expertise and professionalism, made me feel relaxed and comfortable.  Thank you Hand & Stone, I'm so glad I stopped by when I was charging my car at River Park!!  This was exactly what I needed!  I have had many massages since the early 1980's, and I know when excellence is found!!</text>< Pics>

< review>
Really generic massage. My husband and I did a couples massage. He got the stone massage and I opted for the extra foot/massage scrub since they couldn't do two stone massages at once. Which is a loss of money on their part. We ached so bad from a BIG hike we had just done and were REALLY looking forward to getting a good massage.
His massage was good. Mine was just ok. I expected to get a foot rub and scrub for the extra $15. It was more of a wash and hot towel for $15. Don't get the foot scrub and massage. It's a JOKE. Which was a waste of $15. We have never tried hand and stone and honestly for the $200+ price tag we NEVER will go again. I should have asked for a refund for at least the $15 for the joke of a foot scrub.
It's a cattle call to see how many people they can get in and out in the fastest way possible. It is SO much more personal when you get a massage by a person running their own business. They CARE way more.</review>

Took my niece in for a pregnancy massage and I had a regular massage. Both of us had a fabulous hour of relaxation.

The estheticians are very knowledgeable in how to best treat the various skin conditions they encounter and the procedures they offer are almost as good at what you would have to pay big bucks for at a dermatologist. The massage therapists they have should be able to provide a variety of techniques to meet anyone's particular need.

My back and shoulders were killing me for two days, so I desperately went here based off ratings and I’m so happy I did! David gave me one of the best hour-long massages I’ve ever had in my life, and now my body is free of the issues I had when I stepped through their door. I'll definitely come back and I recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

I was debating on give the places 3 or 4 because on of the employees had bo. Overall everybody was nice and sweet at the counter. The employee with the bo I cannot enjoy my massage. And for the price for the massage it was not worth going back for it again. Employer wasn't hard enough and I asked her to be harder.< /Text>

Unless its your first time(if it's your first time the price is ok, 70 bucks for 1 hour) it's over 100 bucks for a 50 minute massage! Bare bones, too. Aromatherapy is extra, hot towel wrap extra, everything is an extra charge. Sheer Bliss does all this included in their price(in case you're wondering, sheer bliss is a small business with only 3 or 4 massage therapists so their hours and availability is limited)Not sure I'll be coming back if I have to pay full price. They just want to get you to do a membership.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Hand and stone is a wonderful spa. Everyone is super friendly. The therapist are great and really know what they are doing. The front desk staff is extremely helpful and not at all pushy when it comes to memberships. I used to be a member at massage envy and this spa is far superior. Thank you hand and stone!<//text>

I have been going there on and off for a while now and I can only say this place is second to none in Fresno. I have tried massage envy and other places but none of them seemed to really take time to find out exactly what I needed and none of them had the same level of professionalism that I enjoy at Hand and stone. Friendly staff and Becky is the best massage therapist I’ve ever dealt with! I’d definitely recommend going there!<//text>

Great Customer service. I just had my first massage and facial. It was amazing. My back was hurting so much and today I woke up feeling great! I also learned some very helpful information about how to take care of my skin during my facial. I can't wait to go back for another self-care day!< /review>

Massage and facial, both women were very knowledgeable and offered great advice for continued care.  I, also was in need of a good product (DERMALOGICA) for skin care and only 2 days of use and I am noticing softening of my skin, especially my sandpaper forehead.  Pamper yourself, get a brow wax and facial or hot rock massage, you desire it.< /Review>< user_name>

<review>Dont say we get an hour massage when you either take us in late or maybe on time and stop the message anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes early so you can deduct our getting dressed time from our "one hour massage" then have the massage person supposedly be able to "change" the sheets in the light speed amount of time in order to try and get the next client in on time. I think you should honor the hour we are paying for! Schedule massages 15 minutes after the first appointments hour is fully over to give enough time for them to actually CHANGE the sheets without cutting into the clients hour massage.

REPLY TO OWNERS MESSAGE:  There is no reason to call in unless you fix your mis-advertising. You cant offer me a service to make up for missing out on 10 plus mintues each session. The start time and end time of the massage should be an hour. Not right to start your time when we are getting undressed and dressed. Also give you staff ENOUGH time to CHANGE the sheets not just close the door and make the bed for the next customer. Very disgusting to lay in a bed naked that someone else was in!< /review><gmap_id>0x8094681df2eaaaab:0x8aec721042b50e6a</gmap_id>< Pictures>

I called 2 days in advanced and booked my 2hr massage and 1hr facial back to back. It was heaven and with holidays coming up. I also got their Black Friday special buy 2 gift cards and get 1 free. Holiday stuffers for a 1hr massage or facial. I do highly recommend this location.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I literally just walked out and I am so amazed and feel so relaxed.  Everything was amazing. From the front desk (Brie) to my massage therapist (Kay).  I chose the hot stone massage after speaking with Brie over the phone the day prior and she made me feel comfortable with a choice that was best for me and she was right!  I haven't had a real massage in over 3 years so I was extremely tense and Kay fixed me.  I immediate signed for their membership before I left.  I will be back every 2 weeka.<//Text>

Last month my husband and I signed up as members and brought the price down for our couples massage. The massage was great! This month,  I got a facial from Candice. She asked about taking before and after photos to determine if it helped my redness.<//review>

Made an appointment today(09/24/2017) as a surprise to my husband and he absolutely loved it. Thank you especially to Tabitha for helping me set up the appointment and Amber for being so sweet and making him feel so comfortable! It's a beautiful place and you all are so great! Thank you.</Text>

Probably the best massage I've gotten. I don't think I would have been able to go if I didn't have a gift card. After your first visit ($69) the price goes up to $109.<//text>

I had my second massage here and I have to brag about Nia. She worked out all my kinks and I added the peppermint scalp massage and it was very relaxing and totally worth it. I am very pleased with the service I received today. Thank you Nia and hand and stone. See you next month. 03/25/2018 😊< /review>

First time there. I had the facial with diamond microdermabrasion .  Margaurite was a pleasure and explained everything she applied.  Wish they would've given a discounted price for me adding that extra option.</text>

I usually give Enterprise Car Rental 5 stars, but, I was so disappointed with this past experience. When I arrived, my rental had been given away to someone with the same name...really; can't assume, ID is used for a reason.  Fine resolved...but, because I made my reservation late, there was no premium SUV, I missed the phone call, the morning of the rent, which not only did I not get my premium SUV,  but it would have been difficult to try to rent from another agency. Why confirm my reservation if my selection was unavailable??!! So yeah, I was a little disappointed. My review should probable be 2 stars!! However, the agent renting to me was nice & apologetic.  I'm a softy. Enterprise was saved, because some of the members of my party had an emergency & were unable to come, thus the smaller SUV worked. It could have been a worse scenario. I could have been left in a real bind.</text>

The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of the friendliness of the employees.  I was scheduled to pick up at 10. Didn't drive away until after 12 noon. The whole operation seemed very unorganized to me. They did mention being short-handed. The woman at the desk was real and honest about how long the wait was going to be. The man who brought the car to me had the very best customer service skills I have ever seen any where. I chose the "you click,  we pick" option and was pleasantly surprised to get a really decent vehicle. Had the staff not saved this rental, I would be lodging some serious complaints and demanding compensation lol. Thank your Hayward Staff, Enterprise!</Review>

By far my favorite rental car location in the entire Bay Area! Tangela at Enterprise was kind, stellar, and went above and beyond!

My rental was clean and in excellent condition. It had excellent horsepower and had top of the line features. I shared with the team how much I loved the car I rented, and they generously offered to sell me the car with excellent mileage for a bargain price! They are so kind and really care about their customers.

If you are looking for value, excellent deals, and a compassionate and hard-working team, this is your place. Thank you, Tangela and Enterprise Hayward!<//review>

My whole interaction with this office has been very poor, and simply didn't care. The reservations was called in by 9:20 AM. I was never pick up from the dealerships but rather to continue to wait I just walked to their office. Once in the office I got my rental fairly quick and they blame the dealership for the pickup miscommunication. The rental vehicle was on enty it even had the gaslight on. The rep told me their gas card had been stolen. The vehicle was parked for a few hours; once I got back inside the car smell like smoke/marijuana. I called enterprise looking to swap the vehicle. I was told they didn't have any available cars but I could call or go to another location to swap. I took their vehicle back only after a few hours of picking it up and they did not offer any other solutions, they simply did not care.<//Review><user_id>108102996317478633703< /user_id>< gmapID>

Avoid this particular Enterprise. Not helpful in the slightest. They "canceled" my reservation as a no-show, even though each reservation at other locations is held for 12hrs...but not here. So, after realizing it was a corporate account, they moved my reservation to another location with availability, but that was another $40 in Lyft fees, in addition to the original $50 just to get to their location in the first place! Trash...absolutely trash; from the staff, to the actual location. I'd give em' a zero if I could...poor reflection upon Enterprise as a whole.< /Text>

It was a pleasure renting with Enterprise. Hassle free and friendly staff ready to serve you. This was my first time using them and that was the best decision I've made. Gave them a call since they offered pickup with 2 miles from their facility and was greeted by Hanna who was a sweetheart. We got to the establishment and than was greeted by Kelsey (sorry if I got your name wrong) whom than started my rental and was a breeze. I was out of there within 20 minutes even though there were 4 ppl in front of me  I didn't see that many car selections but I would use this location again especially with the fast friendly customer service provided. Keep up the great work guys!<//Review>

I reserved a car online and when i got there they gave me a different car and it smelled like smoke i have a newborn and a 4 year old i wanted to return the car but they closed right after i am not a smoker they should be really careful. If they cant take the smell off of the cars might as well not rent it if its smelly. Whats the use of making a reservation of a certain car online if they don't have it and give you a different one. They really need yo straighten up their reservations online and stick what was reserved.< /review>

Rented on a Fri afternoon. they ran out of the car we wanted, but they upgraded to Black Nissan Maxima, which was being returned as we we were waiting. They wash & disinfected right away.  Enjoyed the car  for the Reno trip, even though it took all year to get there.< /review>

Since I’m an Enterprise plus member, I was offered a Free upgrade when I made the reservation online. A day before my pickup when one of their employees called me to confirm my reservation, he informed me that I would be offered the free upgrade when I pickup my rental. When I got there, they said they don’t have any Standard size car (Which was going to be FREE upgrade) and hence couldn’t offer me the free upgrade. Had to settle for an Intermediate size car which isn’t the one I was looking for.
This branch has very limited options. Disappointed that I wasn’t able to get the benefits of being a loyal Enterprise plus member< /review>

Complaint Type:
Customer Service Issues
Description of Complaint:
In a continuing dispute between my insurance company and the collision center repairing my vehicle, Enterprise Rental in Hayward was the location I chose to rent a vehicle from. During the ongoing investigation that the Bureau of Auto Repair conducted with my insurance company and the collision center that held my vehicle hostage I spoke several times to ALISA ALVARADO an employee at Enterprise Rental (Hayward 20885 Mission) who was unprofessional, disrespectful, rude and condescending with every verbal encounter I had with her which equaled 3 verbal encounters and 1 in person. I currently work in the automotive industry and frequently refer my clients to rental agencies. I will never send my clients to Enterprise specifically the Hayward location because of Alisa Alvarado. VERY RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, UNPROFESSIONAL AND CONDESCENDING. STAY AWAY if you are looking for great customer service.

Desired Settlement:
Contact by the Business
Desired Outcome Description:
Alisa Alvarado should be trained properly in customer service and how to communicate effectively with clients. Alisa Alvarado should also be taught the foundation of professionalism and how to represent her company properly. I also would like a written apology from Alisa Alvarado.<//text>

We were helped my a girl named Hanna. Clearly she wasn’t happy working there bc the way she treated us. No customer service at all. I’ve been to this location before and never had a problem. Nothing too serious happened, just Hanna had an attitude throughout our whole interaction.

Customer service was adequate. Car condition was clean and appeared well sanitized. Return was smooth and hassle free and friendly customer service as well. Both pick up and return customer service were friendly despite the high peak time.< /text>

<text>I picked up a truck yesterday that was dirty, they rented a truck to be that wasn’t cleaned out or sanitized! I got into the car and it had this strong smell I didn’t know what it was until I picked up my wife( first thing she said was this truck smells like weed! ) after checking we found crushed weed in the car, called them and the lady I spoke with just said okay, we don’t have another truck<//text>< pictures>

Why is this location still accepting reservations when it’s closed? It says no where that I could find that it was closed.

Took an Uber here to find it closed up and boarded up. There were a few other people there at the time too who had come to pick up rentals, two different people had come to return rentals and It was closed.

There were no notices or anything with information saying when it would open so disappointing.

Anticipating a car, I had to take another Uber to another rental agency and rent a car from them. Budget was open.<//review>

Superb car rental place. Excellent customer service. I was referred here by AutoNation Toyota Dealership. I rented a Ford F150 for two days. It was a great experience. The ladies at the front office were great. They treated their customers like kings. Next time I need to rent a car, Enterprise will have my business. That's for sure.<//Review>

<Review>One of the worse locations to rent a car. I made reservations.  They didn’t have the car when I arrived.  They never called me in advance or I would have booked at another place.  They gave me a truck instead of the luxury car I wanted.   I waited like for 1 hr for the truck.  If I wasn’t desperate, I would have just left without the truck.  Poor service.  Never will return here again. You can pull up my reservation and see if I got what I reserved and also from the time I checked in and time I left.  At least someone should have made an effort to call in advance or at least provided a better vehicle.  I wish I could give a lower rate than 1 star.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

Well I went to pick up my rental car and they were very limited at the time and I got a Toyota Corolla. Used to say it's kind of small for me, but they were very kind and told me to call back later to see if they had another car for me. So I called back and they had a pickup truck which works better for me due to my size LOL. But yes they were very helpful and the service was excellent</text>

The staff at this Enterprise location were outstanding in getting me checked in and on my way. The vehicle was clean inside and out. And the price was actually cheaper than I expected. I would recommend this location to anyone who reads this. I also plan on revisiting this Enterprise location for my next rental.<//review>

Very friendly and helpful. When they learned where i was staying they looked into another location that was closer to me so that i did not have to make the longer trip to the original  pick-up location. When dropping off, i asked if they could drive us to our lodgging location and they were more then willing to help us out. very please with enterprise and would use them again on my future trips.< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>This Enterprise is not good. Ines, one of the managers, is fantastic, but the other employees I've interacted with are pretty terrible. When I picked up my rental earlier this month I interacted with 2 men working the front desk. I was asking the rep some general questions about driving the rental car into Canada (a very normal thing that is thoroughly documented on the Enterprise website) and they repeatedly said that I couldn't drive it into Canada and that it would be towed at the border. The other rep at the desk confirmed this and didn't provide any alternatives. I had to ask what some alternatives would be and they both said I would have to rent another car in Washington state to drive over the border.

I completed the rental and immediately called the general help line. The representative over the phone, Terry, was incredibly helpful and confirmed that I was completely fine to drive the rental car into Canada as any Enterprise rental can freely travel throughout the U.S. and Canada. From my knowledge, this office is short-staffed so I can imagine it's difficult to get employees together to talk through training, but there needs to be a higher level of customer service. I'll likely drive further down Mission to the other Enterprise the next time I need a rental.</review>< user_id>

<review>My first time at this place the person that "helped" me was very disrespectful and wasn't even allowing me to pay for the rental, after checking my licence he requested proof on income, proof of address and insurance which I had to download for him on my phone and we're not listed on the reservation checklist, he even asked me to let him see my debit card. His attitude towards me changed completely once he verified my income. Second time here I was 2 minutes late and I completely understand that 2 minutes are enough to miss my reservation but as they were leaving they all avoided and ignored me when I attempted to approach them to ask them a question regarding my missed reservation.< /review><userid>110970568775660471925<//userid>< name>

Very friendly staff. I was able to get in and out quickly. And returning was the same experience. Since they use a tablet they can email agreements and receipts which cuts down on paperwork time.

I'm soo upset with the situation I just was put through. I made a reservation about 2 months ago and these people gave priority to someone that had a claim that walked in!!! They would've made more money out me than the insurance customer. I was going to rent this car for more time than he was. I'm angry at these people!!😡😡< /Text>

<Text>uneventful rental as it should be, dropped off after hours,  they left me a message saying that all is good and they released the hold on the deposit. They never send me an invoice.
I discover a month later that they charged me an extra day and charged for insurance even so I had declined it.
When I called they couldn't fix the issue and had to request paperwork from headquarters to prove that I declined insurance.
I emailed them a copy to speed it up but still didn't hear for 2 more days. When I contacted them again they still gave me the runaround, never apologized and I still haven't seen a refund< /Text>< name>

Chris M'}<//response><review>Recently rented a car from this location through my insurance. Manager and employee tried to bait and switch me, hard. Both were fully aware of what my policy covered, and told me over the phone that a car suitable to my needs was available in the lot, so i asked them to pick me up. However, upon arrival at the location, i was told that all cars that would fit my budget were 'reserved' and i would have to choose between a few other cars, at a markup of course. Sure, it would be nice to drive around in a mustang or charger, but you and i both know my policy does not cover that kind of vehicle without additional cost, and both manager and employee were hungry for that extra revenue. I was extremely disappointed in both their conduct, and stopped the transaction in it's tracks. I told them both i was extremely agitated and that i wanted to be brought back home, as i had no interest in being the victim of predatory business practices. Suddenly, realizing that the rental was about to completely disappear rather than be upgraded, the manager and employee talked privately for about 30 seconds before offering me a full size vehicle with a waiver for the price. As nice of a gesture as this was, it only came after i caught BOTH employees aggressively trying to upsell me.

In conclusion, i would NOT recommend this location for anyone who isnt totally sure of exactly what they want and what they expect. You might just end up taken for a ride before you even get your car.<//review><gmap_id>0x808f93f661a66411:0xa65b3b6c21a6bbc9< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Update: I emailed Carol H. but nothing happened. Watch out when you return your car if they charge you the gas which you don't use.
--------------------------------------------------
My car was broken and I rent a car here. I returned it on Nov 15 to Autonation Toyota dealership and Enterprise charged me $61.59 for the gas. When I rent it, it was 7-8 and I refilled gas on Nov 15 up to more than 8. However they charged me first without any notification. I found it later and then they said gas tank is about half so they charged. Manager promised me to check with Autonation Toyota and called me back but it never happened, All processes is so disappointed and not trustable. I don't know who tell me a lie but never return it to Autonation Toyota.<//Text><GmapID>0x808f93f661a66411:0xa65b3b6c21a6bbc9< /GmapID>< Name>

<user_id>108290537611337002678</user_id><review>This review is for the management at this location. I checked in with Jared this morning and was unable to rent my reservation I booked three weeks ago. I was able to provide my driver's license, auto insurance, debit card, and other documentation like a medical bill or my 401K letter from my employer with my address and name on it. Unfortunately, because I was unable to provide a "utility" bill, the car could not be released to me. However, all my other documentation that had my name and residential address on it was obviously not enough. By the way, I'm using my debit card in which I'm the only one who has the pin number, but that still was not good enough.

Attached is a reminder email with my reservation number and details. If you need this documentation, the reminder emails should state what should be included for check in. Jared checked me in for my last trip. I provided him the same documentation last time and I was never asked at check in to provide a utility bill and I checked out just fine. I had to walk home 4-5 miles because my co-worker dropped me off to rent the car. By the way it was raining and cold. I was not able to call an Uber due to this location not proving WiFi. I was also unable to pull up further documentation off my phone because of the internet access issue. I was not offered a shuttle or anything and had to walk back home from the location. I'm super angry and will not be renting from this location or company again.

Hopefully you guys take my bad experience into consideration. You should really get WiFi for people to access and make exceptions in certain cases.

I had received a rental car from Enterprise of Hayward in the last week of May and worked with Danielle. Honda of Hayward had issued this rental car since they had prolonged the repairs on my vehicle and had agreed to pay for the enterprise rental.

I had return the car in its original condition without any scratches or damages, there was a full gas of tank, and the vehicles was return when the office was closed. I had also left a voicemail for Danielle the agent I worked with explaining to her that I returned the car  and to give me any calls if there any issues.

I have not received any calls after the drop off in May and I didn’t get any calls in June. I was  checking my credit card statement I noticed that I was charged $50. I have called the general enterprise number we’re not sure why I was charged 50 since all the coverage of the vehicles to be covered by Honda Hayward.

I am disappointed that the staff didn’t inform their customer of unnecessary charges and find this frustrating. And to be charged a mo th later!!From reading the reviews this seems to be a repetitive occurrence.

This is poor business conduct and I hope that I can get a call.<//Review>

Enterprise is my top pick for car rentals for business occasions . Staff are usually nice and the entire process took less than 15 minutes. This place also sometime gives free upgrade which is also nice.</Text>

The service was fast and the staff was very personable and friendly. The menu had a lot of options (with the fillings clearly indicated) and the burritos my family purchased were excellent. Inside of the restaurant, there's beautiful artwork and was overall a comfortable atmosphere; outside was peaceful and made for an enjoyable meal.
I would 10/10 recommend this restaurant.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Stopped by on our way back from San Francisco so we had a good point of reference for some better quality Mexican food. Ordered two tacos, one Birria and one lengua and an horchata. Food wasn't horrible here, flavor was OK and the prices weren't horrible but the girl at the front wasn't really great to interact with. Almost seemed like I was more of a bother than what she wanted to deal with. Don't think ill be coming back here again.</Text>

They had no public restrooms. I ordered three tacos Al Pastore very greasy and very salty.

Also we asked the girl in front if you had Restrooms. Her response was they were closed because of Covid.<//Review>

My husband and I stopped by on our way to Eureka. He said the burrito he had, with marinated grilled chicken, was one of the best burritos he’s ever had. He said it was a thing of beauty - ample in size and loaded with flavor. I had vegan street tacos and they were wonderful.</Text>

<Review>This will be our stop from now on. We almost always stop in Williams when traveling to Sacramento or San Francisco, usually at Carl's Jr or Starbucks. This time my husband wanted Subway but they were closed so we wandered over to the little place next door. Very flavorful and fresh food and friendly staff. We had tacos and tostada and the burrito the person next to us had was huge. Anyway looking forward to more visits and hop
you will give it a try!< /Review>< pics>

It's small place but very hoseepitable burritos are delicious. Overall a very good place to eat and the food is real home made food. Doesn't feel like fast food. 1st time to eat there but I think you will like the experience.</review>

<Review>I've eaten tacos many places and Tacos La Barca were very good. The prices were acceptable and not overpriced. The flavor of the meet was good and not salty at all and the toppings perfect. I hate when tacos are topped with to much and you can't enjoy it. I would definitely eat here again and the staff were friendly and made my friend and I feel welcome.< /Review><response>None<//response><user_id>114127634460431100598<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x8083648db144b879:0x72e216b998bc35e8<//Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I can't prove it but I got short chaged at this place. I  gave her a 100 dollar bill and gotten shorten 45 dollars. I was busy talking to my sister and daughter.  She asked if I wanted a receipt and said no. I don't know why but I did. She counted my change as I was talking and distracted and forgot to count it while sitting down. Later when I realized I was shorten I went back to the restaurant and asked if I accidentally put 20s instead of 2 dollars in the tip jar.  She checked and said no. I asked her I gave you a hundred right? She said yes. Then asked if something happened.? At this time I'm freaking out and thinking I lost my mind.I went back to my car to count my money and look around my car. No 45 dollars no where. I went back in asked for my receipt and she showed me my order and that I paid exact change.I did not pay exact amount and she agreed earlier. Plus I remember asking her if she could take a 100 bill.I went back to my car to verify with my sister. She knows I gave her one bill. I went back in and asked her to count her drawer and she said she can't and gave me her, her card to call. I explained im out of town and can't come right back. She told me to call at 7:30 and called and whelp no answer after 3 times after 20 rings each. Well my number of course is a long distance number a n d she is avoiding my call. Yes its my fault I should of gotten my receipt and a should of counted my change. But its still not ok they stole from me. So beware and watch your money or card. They're theives.

Update to the owner...I would check your employee I did give her 100 and she gave me some change back but not all of it I was missing 45 dollars.  If it wasn't for your employee showing me a fake a receipt I wouldn't be so suspicious but when my mom, sister and 10 yr old daughter knows you gave me change how could I paid exact amount. I also only 117 on me so I used the 100 asking her if she could accept it. I was going to use some of that money for gas to get back home. Which is about two hours away. I had to use some of my grocery money to cover that so thanks. You might be hurting from covid but you shouldn't go and hurt other people to make a recovery. So yes I gave you a low score for being dishonest  I know what your employee did and its not right seriously if it wasn't for the fake receipt I would have thought I lost the money but know I know what for sure went down  If I had the evidence the police would of been involved.  I for sure will never go back to your place. I hope who ever does watches and is aware and gets their correct change. I let my guard down being not paying attention lesson learned thank you. But you were wrong for taking advantage  gods watching remember that.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1612652720347, 'text': 'im sorry to hear that we are new owners now tho you should come try the new food\n😊'}< /Response>< GmapID>

Been going here since it was the truck in Colusa. Always fast, affordable and great food. Never had anything to complain about, and is in the top 3 burritos I've eaten anywhere in and out of California. When traveling to CA, I typically get several extra to freeze and bring home with me.</text>

We stumbled across this taqueria on our way to Mt Shasta and we’re so glad we did! Shrimp tacos and a sope de lengua hit the spot. Salsas were spicy and delicious. Service was super friendly and welcoming. Will definitely visit again on our next road trip!< /text>

Fantastic tacos! By chance, my friends and I encountered this place while on a road trip, and we're happy we did. We ordered a bunch of tacos with a variety meats (carnitas, chorizo, al pastor), and they were all delicious. Staff was friendly and the dining area was clean. Will definitely stop by here again if the opportunity arises. Definitely recommended!</text>

<Review>I came here with high expectations after Tacos La Barca was recommended by coworkers and I was NOT disappointed. I ordered the shrimp taco plate with rice and beans on the side and a large coke. That meal hit the spot. I will be back - the service was prompt and the tables were clean. Next time, Ivan going to try the burrito.</Review><username>Jared Borba< /username>< time>

Oh my goodness,  the food is delicious. The staff is wonderful and will take the time to explain what is on the menu. The salsa is authentic and just has the right amount of spice. I would definitely recommend.</Review>

Staff were very indifferent towards guests that were interstate travelers and our service suffered because of it. When locals came in the atmosphere brightened in the place. Sadly, the food was only average.< /review>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Tiny tacos, about the size of half a hotdog without the bun.  No real toppings, no chips and salsa, nothing. The little bit of meat was  tasty.  BUT... the lady that took the order is sort of grumpy/unfriendly.  No greeting, NO smiles, NO nothing.  TheN she ask for tips on the pad she hands you for payment, but she didn't do anything but take an order with a grumpy attitude.  It's not a regular sit on restaurant where they take you order at the table and serve you so why force tips?<//review>< Pics>

Imagine...finding excellent Mexican food in a community that is at least 75% Hispanic...it is a nice place to live no matter your ethnicity...and the bonus is great Mexican foods. Looks like I will be learning to speak Spanish if I want to talk to my fellow towns folks...lol< /text>

On our travels north and south on I-5, this will definitely be our new stopping place for food. The burritos are very large, enough for 2... unless you want leftovers. I haven't seen chicken adobado before, but I ordered it and was not disappointed. There is a restaurant hot sauce inside the burrito that is pretty spicy. But also really tasty. I doubt you could drive and eat, so order 'para aqui.'</review>

From the outside, very unassuming.  On the inside, these were the cleanest tables and restrooms I have seen.  For a quick bite, this place is waaaayyy better than any fastfood joint.</Text>

Damn good and autenico! My husband and I stopped here while traveling down the 5 instead of going to the Taco Bell we normally hit and we're so glad we did. The chile relleno burrito was massive in both size and flavor. I'm stuffed and I took half to go. His carne asada tacos were reportedly really good too. We will definitely be repeat customers.</Text>

Solid Mexican ”fast” food in an unpretentious strip-mall eatery. The menu is more limited than a typical Mexican restaurant, so don't expect restaurant variety; what they do have (tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tortas) is very good, and their variety of meats is exceptional in its breadth. If you're hungry for Mexican on your road trip, stop by.< /Text>

< Review>
I don’t know where the people are from who gave this place good reviews. It was the worst taco place I’ve ever eaten. The beans were mostly lard and the carnitas were so heavily salted I almost didn’t taste how old they were. 4 stars for old grease content.</Review>

Want someone to do a fade and not take over an hour to do it? Gina is the person to talk to. Of course, everyone else that works here is fantastic too. My family comes here and everyone loves their cuts. This is a full service barbershop and hair salon, doesn't matter which way you swing they can get it done.

Parking is a bit tight so be prepared to park on the street if the parking lot is full.<//Text>< user_name>

<review>I am addicted to skin fades and a straight razor part because of this place. Cuts are executed with precision and last as long as you want them to due to the expert technique.
This place is perfection; Outlaw Barbershop performs at peak levels consistently - perhaps one could say they are the Michael Jordan of the barbershop world.< /review><Time>1474447525804< /Time><rating>4<//rating><response>None<//response><Name>Keith Link< /Name>< pictures>

This is the bestest Barbershop ever!  Clean, hip, and fun all under one roof.  Gina, the owner, is ultra cool and her lines, fades and chops are like no other.  She is way talented.  I drive all the way from Ojai to come here 'cause  there is no place comparable in Ventura County.</Review>

<Text>I generally love outlaw all the girls are extremely talented except today I got my hair cut and asked for a simple haircut #2 on the sides with the top let roughly the same, basically a very subtle fauxhawk. What I got after this "barber" got to work on me with her texture scissors and clippers was something closer to simple jack from tropic thunder. Not kidding I looked like I had alopecia or had gone through chemotherapy. She should be fired. I had to have my hair taken down to almost completely buzzed all around and even that is very uneven. I myself can't screw up a buzz cut. Don't ask for Natasha, ask for someone with experience. This employee has zero work ethic. The other girl who was working although was quite helpful and they are a great place just with one bad employee< /Text>< user>

I guess I should’ve went with the majority of the reviews and got pizza...I ordered the lasagna to go.  Lacking flavor most of my pasta is crunchy on the edges there is hardly any meat sauce. The website says it comes with a salad upon request I had to pay for the salad. Which was very small and the house dressing was watery and the salad looks nothing like the pictures.< /text>

Pizza is fantastic! They work hard to provide us with the best service possible, going above and beyond our standards. The waiter made certain that I had everything I needed. This restaurant was one of my favorites.</text>

Nick is awesome!! Super friendly and the spinach tortellini I ordered was absolutely delicious. It was my first time eating that dish and I was very happy with my choice. Since that was their Thursday special, it was not only easy on my pocket but I will definitely be returning this Thursday. Excellent job for carrying on this delicious legacy, Nick. Others choosing this restaurant won't be disappointed. Thank you. I'll be back for more! Cya soon! From Sherry<//review>

Place was cute and homey, and the staff were quick and attentive. The best though came in 15 minutes time,,,PIZZA!!! Talk of moist, cheesy and tasty. We ordered a large and after 2 slices each we were stuffed and in heaven. Would definitely eat here again and bring some friends.</Review>

Great food. When you dine in you get a salad with your meal. When you order food togo they gave you your salad for only a short time period. So now once again No Salad with togo orders very frustrating.< /text>

I ordered by phone for curbside pick up and was deeply disappointed. I ordered a large pizza with mushrooms, onions, 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 green pepper. This is what I got: a pizza with no mushrooms, pepperoni and green pepper on the whole thing, and tons of olives....that everyone had to pick off one by one. I also ordered breadsticks with sautéed Alfredo sauce...the sauce was butter and pesto, and was spilled all over the bag, so what should have been 6oz was maybe 2oz of sauce and a huge greasy mess. Will not be going back< /text>

<Review>I had been this place twice before as a delivery driver and the pizza always smelled INCREDIBLE to me.

I finally got to try a pizza myself on my birthday and it was an EXCELLENT choice for a birthday dinner. (I love pizza)

My boyfriend and I ordered a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza. It was so delicious! FRESH and HOT out of the oven, great crust almost perfect, fresh ingredients and they aren't frugal with the toppings at all. The cheese, sauce, meat and mushrooms were just soo good.  Their housemade ranch is sooo good too. Really good.

Customer service was great, we got our pizza on time, pleasant guy that helped us. I'll definitely come back when I'm in the area very soon. I'd recommend anyone to come here for some legit, very delicious pizza.<//Review>< Pictures>

One of my favorite restaurants they always have fresh pasta and seafood every time I come. You always need a reservation ahead of time because they fill up very fast since it's a small restaurant but this will always be an all time favorite spot for seafood pasta next time I'm in San Francisco I'll be sure to dine here again.</Review>

Their pastas are made in house and you can absolutely taste it. Their lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs are legendary. I highly recommend checking out the pasta special on your first visit. Gives you a bit of everything and leaves you wanting more.

Nick, the owner, was very attentive and took time to explain all the daily specials. Easy to see from the street. Accessible and regular parking available right out the door.
Their cheese pizza is abundant and delicious.
Will need to go back to taste their pastas another time.<//review>< Pictures>

Make sure you stop by and enjoy a great meal.< /Text>

<review>Best pizza in Costa Mesa! Genuine hand tossed pizza. Excellent crust, rich sauce, quality cheese and toppings. Their pizza is so big that it can't even fit in the box! In fact if you order a small pizza, what you end up with is like a medium! Also on Wednesdays they have all-you-can-eat Spaghetti for only $5<//review>< pictures>

I am the negative review but I am also the honest one. I ordered the 12' extra cheese but it lacked flavor. The bread also subpar very chewy. I've tried more flavourful pizza for $5. Try another cheese supplier?< /Text>

Great food, great prices, outstanding service!

I feel pretty guilty that it's taken me right around 4 years to review Pizza D'Oro as I would've been lost without their fantastic catering at great prices.  4 years ago, I signed up to bring in dinner for my middle daughter's drama rehearsal and then I scrambled to figure out what I was going to order.  We happened to be dining at Pizza D'Oro so I grabbed a catering menu.  The pasta party pack was EXACTLY what I needed and the price was better than I could've ever hoped for.  The kids loved it so much, I continued to order the pasta party pack for each shows tech rehearsal for the next 4 years.   The party packs have also been my go-to when family comes up to visit and we want an inexpensive but tasty meal to feed a large group.

On the individual entree side, things are equally as amazing.  I love 3-cheese penne with meatballs and my husband is a fan of the 3-cheese penne with garlic sauce.  Both the house salad and antipasto salad are fantastic especially mixing the ranch and italian dressings together.  They also have great daily specials.

Definitely going to be placing a to-go order soon..</text>

The best service and best food period. Always a win to come in. The grandson of the owner who I believe his name was Michael was the best server we ever had in any restaurant. I cant recommend any other place with this restaurant making the rest of the service industry look bad.<//review>

One of my favorite places to go for a mellow dinner out. Food is awesome. Try the lasagna, the pizza, the chicken, the soup, chicken parm, etc. etc. Great people working there always nice and seem to always recognize you and can guess your order even if its been a month or so. Thanks Pizza D!</review>

Small hole in the wall. It has great all you can eat daily specials. It is a cozy little place with much italian character.  It is family friendly ,  customers of all ages. You could eat there by yourself comfortably.
Nick, the owner, was very attentive and took time to explain all the daily specials. Easy to see from the street. Accessible and regular parking available right out the door.
Their cheese pizza is abundant and delicious.
Will need to go back to taste their pastas another time.</review>

<text>Honestly the food is usually pretty good. Service kinda sucks here. I love coming because they have good specials and good food but for a small place and having bad service definitely sucks. Only thing I dont like is that they cake on the sauce like way too much. But that could just be personal preference.< /text></record>

Very small place, but excellent service.  Tried a giant source of pepperoni pizza from lunch menu and it was very good, made fresh and filled me up.  Server offered marinara sauce for the crust too.<//review>

Nice quaint place that serves great food at a reasonable price.  Pizza is always good,  not greasy. Ask for them to double cut the pizza if you have children.  The lasagna is the best, besides the pizza.< /Text>

We could not have had a better experience here. The staff was VERY friendly and very attentive. The food was EXCELLENT and the portions were HUGE. The prices were well below what I would have expected to pay. I would highly recommend Pizza D’Oro!!!< /review>

The food is delicious! Courteous & fun staff, the prices are extremely affordable for a large amount of food. Th
Giant pizza slice is truly almost half a medium pizza. I recommend & will be going back soon!< /Review>

Went at night and got weird murder vibes but a walk inside made me feel so much more at ease. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food tastes absolutely delicious and you can taste how fresh and homemade it is. Definitely recommend it.</review>

<Review>I've been coming here for 30+yrs & it will Always be a favorite! This last time, however, the service was Waaay off, I'm sad to say. But the food was as Delicious as ever. Another bad service trip, I'll have to see if the one on Newland is still there. Been going there longer, anyway.<//Review>< GmapID>

Love this place! Great pizza with good crust. I come every week or two.

Service is incredible! The dream team of Kacie and Nicole are amazing every time we come.

This place is highly recommended.< /review>

Pizza d Oro is legendary.   When I was young and broke  they fed me all you eat lasagna for 7 bucks on Monday nandnkept me alive.    I am forever in their debt and I continue to go there.  The food is great the people always friendly.  I'm a customer forever!<//Review>

<text>My family is from North Italy on my dad's side I married my wife 37 years who Sicilian
My family on my dad's side is in the restaurant business however when I had pizza the other day it was the best pizza ever taste in the whole life I'm definitely going to refer my family and friends and definitely going to return myself and by the way the seller was excellent as well but the pizza is out of this world no matter where you're from it's worth the drive and if you're visiting Southern California I recommend stopping in for a slice of pizza

That was my first experience when I first went there the second time I went there it wasn't consistent and the pizza was a little over cooked compared to the first time the third time I went there I told him not to overcook the pizza and it was fine then I went there the four time and I told him the same thing and yet the Pizza was not consistent
Are there an that outside the pizza not being consistent the service is good and the rest of the Italian food is good<//text></record>

Pleasantly surprised the moment I walked in. The decor is just enough so that you're not overwhelmed. Great music  played and let's not forget of the generous portions of the slices. Would recommend to friends just as it was recommend to me.<//text>

<Review>This is a little tiny place on Baker. It has been there for a while. I'm sure all their food is good, but I'm really stuck on their lasagna with extra meat sauce, Yummm. There is a small amount of seating there so if it's a big party don't count on seating just get it to go.<//Review>< Pics>

I used to eat here for lunch on a pretty regular basis. The staff were always super friendly and attentive. I'd get pizza by the slice, which was good, but not great. Then one night I ordered a pizza to go. OMG it was great! Apparently fresh pizza is the way to go. Give this place a shot, you'll leave happy.< /Review>

As a huge Italian food lover, you can always tell a great authentic place by the signature sauce. This place winds HANDS DOWN! And for the price, you'll be eating for days... When I want to take a break from the gym and watching my weight, I pig out here. I'd eat the chairs if they put sauce on it! LOL! I really do love this place y'all.</text>

<Review>Best hole in the wall Italian and pizza place around. Huge slice and salad combo is a no brainer for someone who needs their quick pizza fix, great value, without losing the greatness of pizza and all of its glorious flavors.<//Review>< pics>

I had dinner there last nite with family and friends. The service was great! The food was amazing, I never write reviews but after having their garlic chicken penne with red wine sauce I had to give them kudos! The sauce was truly perfect, great flavor, tasted fresh and definitely homemade. The price was great as well. Ill be going back no doubt!</Text>

Long time customer. A local that grew up in the area. In my last visit yesterday I saw a family of 8 leave because apparently Pizza D'Oro got a new rule that says they won't serve alcohol to anyone that does not have a California ID.  The family had  Florida ID's and Visas from what I overheard.  The family was Latino and I think that was the reason for implementing the rule. Ignorance and hate is depressing. I'll spread the word to my friends.<//text>

My family and I greatly appreciate your business over the years.  I wanted to assure you that the alcohol policy that I put into place has absolutely nothing to do with race, religion or ethnicity.  Since 1977, The Latino community has been a valued part of Pizza D'Oro's customer base.  I was not there Tuesday evening but after interviewing the servers who worked as well as the server who denied the sale of alcohol to the table, I only know that the 1 individual out of the party of 8 who was ordering alcohol appeared to be under age with a Florida Driver's licence that was unfamiliar to the server.\nI had recently had a meeting with my staff about the major problem of minors ordering alcohol in our location thinking that since we are not a corporate, it would be easy to get served beer or wine.  The loss of my alcohol licence will occur if people under the age of 21 are caught being served in my business.  I do appreciate you bringing this scenario to my attention as I will have to have a more detailed conversation with my staff about checking ID's for alcohol sales.\nI never want Pizza D' to be thought of in any way other than as a community friendly place of business.  If you wish to email me directly, I very much welcome it as it would give me a chance to go into greater detail about the sensitive topic of the alcohol sales as well as Pizza D's relationship with the local community.  My direct email is PizzaDoroCM@gmail.com.  I hope to hear from you and I sincerely hope you won't let this isolated incident cause you to stop visiting us.  I am very sorry that this incident upset you and the server involved will be educated better on how to handle alcohol sales.\nSincerely,\nPhillip DiPietro  Owner/Manager\nPizzaDoroCM@gmail.com"}<//Resp><username>Carlos Campos<//username></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>They have greatly improved upon my old reviews. The service isn't perfect but it is very good. The pizza is a lot like east coast pizza. I think the pizza here is best between 12 and 2.

This is an extensive reviw about multiple experiences at this location. False Advertising! They offer a Tuesday deal to get money off a pizza; Crazy Tuesday, money off a pizza medium or larger with two toppings. I ordered a large with three toppings on half and one on the other. I was told I am not eligible for the deal. The deal specifies size and diversity of toppings, both criteria I meet. Even the criteria that I need two toppings on the whole pizza is met due to my three on one half being proportional to two on all. This is either a case of false advertising or an idiot with no comprehension as to the meaning of the terms they are using to advertise.
Second time here, just awful service. The waitress continued to pester my brother and myself to order in an empy restaurant when we were obviously looking over our menus. This lead to us eventually waiting for her to come back. This lowers my original two star rating to one star.
I have come to expect great food and just plain awful service. I would recommend the food to go as to avaid the absolutely terrible staff that somehow got hired here.
P.S. Fantastic pizza, best on the west coast. I will continue to come back for the pizza but everything else is awful.
P.P.S. quality not consistent. It is sad when an entire group of people take so little pride in their work.
Today they got my order wrong. Only pit on one of my toppings so I could not get s discount, but hey, I'm sure no one can see incentive in charging more for an incorrect order. Thankfully there are multiple locations. DON'T USE THIS LOCATION. The employees are some of the worst in existence.< /Text><rate>4< /rate>< gmapID>

This is a really good and practical mall. It's got shops and stores that cover a wide range of products a person might need. You can do your banking here. The VTF stops out front.<//review>

Lots of different things to do besides eating and getting a coffee or Jamba Juice here! Shops, salons, clothing stores, the Shoe Palace... restaurants. Plenty of parking, too! Need a haircut, get one! There are at least two places on either side of one parking lot to get a good cut! With Ross, Marshall's, Target, and Fallon's (I think I spelled that name correctly) across the street, clothing choices and other household goods are available to shop around and check out. Your choices are seemingly endless!!!< /Text>

So many things to do here. Groceries and antojitos from Cardenas. Grab a bite to eat from Wingstop, Tk Noodle, Togos or 5 guys. Desert? Of course! Sweet fix is always such a treat.< /Text>

Went to Marshalls there for the first time. Had to wait in line about 20 minutes to go inside. Nice varied selection. Interesting to see what they have after Christmas.< /text>

Best mall for anything you want. Has all the essentials and more. Target, Walgreens and Gardenias all in one place! Wow cant beat that. Sweet Fix is one San Jose's best places to get ice cream. They serve good quality ones too. There's Starbucks both at the target and a standalone store on the other side.

There's also Ross and Marshall's on the same strip. It just cant get better than this. You dont even need to walk around a lot like the other big malls. Overall you will definitely find what you are looking for.<//Text>

I Enjoy the variety of stores in the square  mall along w/ plenty of parking. Mexican Mercado Cardenas, Marshalls, Ross for Less, Sally's Beauty, Walgreens, AT&T store, Jamba Juice, Target & a few more stores to seek & search.  I appreciate Walgreens/ has a variety of services within in the store such as western union, photo center, large section of greeting cards and miscellaneous items you may be seeking to buy instead of going to the big stores if u r pressing4time.   :)  or ?<//text>

There is absolutely to many people in this whole plaza. Every one of the stores is too crowded. No one cares to practice social distancing in the isles at Cardenas at Target at all the stores. It seems to me like people just don't realize how real this virus is me and my children have asthma that alone is an anxiety on top of covid-19 anxiety and on top of both of those is the  social anxiety towards people who do not care at ALL for anyone's else who don't practice social distancing, who don't wash there hands, who just don't care my anxiety is thru the rooftops of the tallest building in the world. It's a shame how people don't care and aren't considerate of other in general. God be with us all. Please 🙏 practice safe measures so we do not spread this evil virus to others. & GO WASH YOUR HANDS 😉</text>

Bank of America  capitol ave gets one star because the line were out the door and around the corner. i understand the covid-19 cases are up but they should come up with a plan to make customers feel more comfortable. Especially during the covid-19 cases are up.<//Text>

I had an appointment with America's best but they wouldn't give me the exam because I was 4 minutes late.. I cancelled and don't care for there business any more I bought glasses for $100 that melts on my skin and leave a blue mark cheap is not good at all... I would rather buy glasses from Wal-Mart for a much better price and much better quality..< /Text>

I went to Wells Fargo Bank.  It was on a busy Saturday afternoon.  As I arrived, a car was pulling out located facing entryway to bank.  I was quickly greeted with how can I be assisted my name was written on await list to speak to a banks rep. Wait was 45 mins. For a extremely busy day I guess the wait was normal.  Everyone was cordial and helpful.  Customers have a variety of language reps available to them when needed.  Great for excellent customer care.<//Text>

There is a good soccer store hidden in the back.  Suited my kid up for soccer here.  The overall shopping center is nice.  They have been making it better and better I think, good location with lots of stores for the area.

it's on the edge of a rougher section of town, I think they are doing a great job with the various tenants making it a resource for the community.<//Review>

The mall could have been a better neighbor shopping place if they have more restaurants, but now other than target, Ross and Michael. I have no reason to go there. Try wing stop and ice cream place. They're great inexpensive place.< /text>

<text>The shopping mall is exactly what the economic demographic of the area dictates. There was a Grocery Outlet which is a blessing in the neighborhood where there are rather eclectic stores in the direct vicinity. There was also a Dollar Tree which if you're not in a hurry can serve your needs. There's also a DD discount store and a 24 Hour Fitness, which I hear has improved since I was there but three or four years ago I know it was horrible. There's also a liquor store which is one of the more friendly in the neighborhood and I had fun there a while back and it wasn't bad. The neighborhood is probably like you to have this place to make ends meet.< /text>< Gmap_id>

< review>
The front side and stores of this mall have been updated,  which is really nice. Sadly, the half of the mall not facing the street is very old and in serious need of maintenance,  updates and new stores. Parking is ample, but the area gets a bit seedy after dark. No security at night, so recommend only going here during daylight hours.</review>

The parking lot behind the mall looks more like a dump than a parking lot.  Dumpsters always filled to capacity, old mattresses and furniture littered throughout, and gulls flying all around fighting for scraps.  Need to do a better job cleaning this area up and patrolling to make sure illegal dumping is not occurring.<//Text>

I was however disappointed that the furniture prices (specifically bedroom sets/mattresses) were so exorbitant. Not only that, but we were told so many conflicting "facts" by various stores we finally left and purchased at Ashley Furniture instead</text>< Pictures>

Well the mall itself is very nice. There's pretty much every store you could need. I was however disappointed that the furniture prices (specifically bedroom sets/mattresses) were so exorbitant. Not only that, but we were told so many conflicting "facts" by various stores we finally left and purchased at Ashley Furniture instead</review>

< Review>
This traffic in the parking lot is bad, I mainly go for the Wells Fargo and Target. The Wells Fargo has 5 atms so there is not much waiting. There is usually parking spaces available even at busy times. They have a Ross and Marshalls as well, but one of my best kept secrets is Fallas just across the street.< /Review>

Great little Neighborhood mall has. Plenty of parking and stores like Walgreens, Target, and Marshalls along with Ross Dress for Less. But it's really noticeable Star Bucks on the corner, is the place to meet?< /Text>

Good place for your Target run, and Mexican grocery store shopping. Parking lot can be super crowded if you go during peak hours or on the weekend.</Review>

Everything from Starbucks to Target to T.K. Noodle to Walgreens. You can get a bite at Burger King or go all you can eat at Hometown Buffet. TOGO's for a sandwich or 76 for some gas. You name it, here is where you can get it...<//Review>

Capitol Square mall is bland and a lot of the stores are essentials which makes this place that much more aggravating. There are homeless people on every entranceway and cops/security cards occassionally drive around. Worst part, independant mechanics or what not keep driving by my car and asking if I need help fixing my car. I'm like, "no?" and they try to give me their card. Happend three times in this tiny area?!  Not a great place. Could be better.<//Text>< Time>

Target, ross, marshall, walgreens are in this lot and some decent quick food options. Starbucks is on one corner and another starbucks inside Target on the other. The best part is...it has hard core socceer fans paradise. Store near walgreens carry all kind of sports wear and shoes. If you looking for manchester united or chelsea fan wears then this is the place to go.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a good place to do your shopping whether it's groceries, clothes, shoes, toys ect.
There is a very good cosmetics and extensions shop for sure. There is fast food there are sports shops among others. In short, it is a good place to visit if you have in mind to buy many things and vary from store in the same place you can do it.

(Original)
Es un buen lugar para hacer tus compras ya sea comestibles, ropa, zapatos, juguetes ect.
Hay una tienda de cosméticos y extensiones  muy buena por sierto. Hay Comida rapida hay tiendas deportivas entre otras. En resumen, es buen lugar para visitar si tienes en mente de comprar muchas cosas y variar de tienda en la misma plaza lo puedes hacer.😉< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I like it because you can find almost everything in this place. The problem is at night, they do not work - some lamps and seve very night - more if you are just with children👩‍👧‍👦 or you go alone and you already know how much each thing happens for we do not know when we are going to enter with unpleasant halgo

(Original)
Me gusta por que puedes encontrar casi, de todo en este lugar. El problema es de noche no sirven😣 algunas lámparas y seve muy noche😯 más si bas con niños👩‍👧‍👦 o vas sola y  ya saben haora cada cosa que pasa por no sabemos cuando nos vamos a entrar con halgo desagradable</Text>< Pics>
