I had called this AT&T store at the Valencia mall a couple of days ago and spoke to Maddie. I was buying 2 Samsung phones online.  She said to come in when we picked up the phones and she would help with setting them up. She got us all set up, answered all our questions and was extremely  patient with us!  Excellent customer service.<//text>

Elmer acknowledged us and offered help as soon as we finished checking in, he was friendly and professional; having come across my complex billing inquiry, he immediately asked store manager Samantha to step in and assist us. Both, Elmer and Samantha, were personable, offered available options and described everything in great detail. My husband and I felt like we were in good hands. Great customer service! Thank you, Elmer and Samantha!<//text>

<review>Best AT&T Mobile thus far. Elmer was very patient and explained all promotions as well as alternative options. Then Samantha helped me through the whole buying process which was smooth and easy. What would’ve taken 3-4 hours at another location took less then an hour. They saved us time and money. Thank you.< /review>< pics>

I had the pleasure of dealing with the manager Elmer last weekend. I can honestly say I’ve never received better customer service. He was very thorough and was very knowledgeable about the products. He helped me set up both of my devices and was very kind throughout my visit! Thanks Elmer!</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I was nervous about getting out and about around town due to my health issues but my fears were quickly eased by the way that the lady that helped me kept her social distance and did all of the foot work for me (she went outside to get the specific product I needed and brought me a few choices). She did a phenomenal job considering our circumstances--I was there for less than five minutes from arrival to departure with the item that I needed. I would definitely recommend this particular AT&T to anyone.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1618446396340, 'text': "Thank you so much for your feedback.

Great customer service provided by Elmer Fox today in solving a technical voicemail issue. Elmer was patient and knowledgeable and fixed the problem.
I would recommend this store and this young man to anyone needing excellent service.</text>

I stopped into store to see about cancelling my Verizon account and switching my number to our AT&T plan.  Elmer the representative that assisted me was extremely knowledgeable, patient, and helpful.  It was totally painless and I’m thinking about cancelling my Spectrum and going with AT&T for my TV and internet.  Thanks!</Text>

Samantha was incredibly helpful and worked with us to seamlessly transfer my mom's number. He also went above and beyond to try and help us qualify for a promotion for a new phone. While it didn't work out, I was impressed that he took the initiative instead of just saying it wasn't possible. This store is also doing a great job of adjusting to the current public health standards due to Covid-19. The staff worked diligently to clean the store after each guest left and made sure that everyone was adhering to social distancing.

Elmer and Samantha were very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the phones and all of what AT&T Mobile has to offer. I would recommend AT&T Mobile to anyone and recommend this store for them to go to to make the switch!</Review>

Great store, always found the AT&T stores to be helpful, I went to T-Mobile and Verizon first as they were closer, neither store was able to help me, however AT&T was patient and resolved the non-existent issue. Would recommend.< /text>

<Review>Great Staff and Great Location inside Westfield Mall across Disney Land, Just got 4 lines from them.  They have a promotions get 4 iPhones 11 for FREE with $35 per line and They gave me a $200 Bill Credit for FirstNET.  I would recommend people to go there as they said they have special promo that other store don't have. Great Promotions.< /Review>< pics>

I was told about this place, and had to try it for myself, been living in North Hills for years and never knew it existed. Pizza smells and taste good. Perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients, customer service was great as well. Walked in to place my order and my pizza was done within 15 minutes. Parking I would say is the only issue for this place very limited, but order online and pick up is easiest way to go here. It's a tiny plaza with about 6 businesses, but there is plenty of street parking around. My kids loved the pizza, so this will be our new go to pizza place. They have carryout deals during weekdays as well.</text>

This place is the one I like best. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The stuff is very warm and the food they serve is so flavorful. I never decline to have a decent dinner in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

Been eating at Pizzasaurus Rex for over 15 years and it's still my favorite go-to place for delicious, super reasonably priced, non chain restaurant pizza. The customer service has always been very good and it's really pretty cool to see them actually toss your dough if you walk in and order. I've introduced many a friend to this place and all of them have enjoyed it as much as I, and have now become customers themselves.< /Text>

I read the reviews and gave them a try.
WOW very excellent pizza. Like it a lot. New go to place. Have visited a few in the past looking for a great place. Counter staff were cordial.

What else could you ask for. Wait what about Price?? $15.00 out the door for a two topping large pizza. Enough said.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Literally the best pizza you will enjoy in the entire San Fernando Valley and surrounding area. Just ate a 16 inch pizza not because I was starving but because it was legitimately so good. They have sauce that tastes homemade and the crust...... oh that damn crust is heavenly. This place has been my number 1 since I first got to the area 3 years ago.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c29af0c4707215:0xf54565c1f8f2c20f</gmapID></record>

Today being disabled l offered to pay the full minimum amount for delivery not for a full pizza but just wings again willing to pay the same price as a pizza and was turned away
It made absolutely no sense to me especially during these tough times and my condition they weren’t willing to make the delivery even though l was ready to pay what they would normally charge for a pizza
I think like l said it not only makes no sense paying whatever they would normally charge but found it to be very inconsiderate especially since I’m only a block away but do to my condition cannot drive not walk there at this time. I am very very disappointed and surprised at the lack of empathy at a customer who already purchased almost on a daily bases.

Good service, good prices, and good pizza. It's mostly takeout there nowhere to seat except few chairs.< /Text>

My girlfriend was craving pizza and this place was close by so we figured why not . Came in, was greeted with a smile, got our order in and got our pizza in a very short time. The food itself was amazing, great herb aromatics, good consistency with the dough the sauce and the cheese, an overall amazing pizza and I'll be coming back whenever I'm in the mood for pizza 😊</Review>

I live 5 minutes from its current location on White Oak and Lassen, and having ordered pizza, wings and salad from there over the last three years,  I confidently recommend Pizzasaurus Rex!

For the price, usually discounted with daily specials they offer, the pizza quality is far above the price. It's a pleasant surprise, and a great alternative to Papa John's, Pizza Hut and Little Ceaser's.

The older gentleman with glasses, presumable the owner, is a delight to deal with. He's courteous, polite and a friendly face.

RECOMMENDED PIZZA CHOICE:  medium pizza with extra sauce, pepperoni, pineapple and thick crust.

If you're in the area or searching for quality pizza, give Pizzasaurus a shot.< /review>

USED TO BE THE SPOT.

Great local spot, love to spend my money here instead of other corporate chain pizza restaurants except their customer service has really gone downhill.

The past 2 orders I've placed have been incorrect ie: adding cilantro instead of basil and not adding ingredients (even though it's been written on the box..). I called to ask for ranch and was met by the owner who was ready to dispute my order placement instead of offering great customer service.

I live a block away from these guys and because of their lack of service I'll gladly drive elsewhere from here on out.</review>

<Text>I used to like it. Local, decent pizza delivered fast. But I just got a large veggie pizza and its bland the dough is not tasty, very little sauce even though I asked for more sauce, said extra cheese but had very little cheese. Ugh sorry guys I'm not buying your pizza again. This dinosaur is extinct in my house.<//Text>< Pictures>

Just saw the pizza delivery guy that drives a red car curse at someone because he didn't give a tip. Now I understand that it may frustrating, but at the end of the day its a customer. There is NO REASON to treat people like this especially not in a place of business.< /Text>

Decent pizza. Opening staff on a Monday was incompetent. 3 grown men running the shop. First there register would not take my debit card, paid cash. Second, cashier wrote my order on a notepad, in front of where pizza is prepared. they said 10 mins, I sat directly in front of the store. After 10 mins I asked, they said not ready. 10 mins later I ask again and it was at the bottom of a stack of other pizzas. Finally order was wrong and the shop did nothing to compensate. I requested my money back, total loss. Will never recommend. Again, incompetence, total incompetence!<//text>

I've been ordering from here every since they opened back in like '89!! $5 bucks for a pie back then lol. But they've remained the go to pizza when you want something quick n easy! A staple in the community and glad to see them still going strong. Try the Feta pizza, awesome.</Text>

Nice stop for boba while shopping at the Livermore Outlets.  The line can get very long, but moves very quickly in my experience.  I ordered the Taro Milk Tea with pearls on my last visit.  It was really refreshing on a hot day.  The drink was almost too sweet for me, but it was still delicious.<//Text>

Got the Matcha Milk tea..it's not sweet. And not much boba pearls Only one worker when I was there so there was a bit of a wait. The rest of my family enjoyed their drinks. Varying from milk tea to juices and smoothies. Not the worst but I wouldn't come back for the matcha milk tea personally.< /Review>

I was watching the person who was making the so called taro milk tea and all he did was put powder, extra water to fill up the cup then he put a drop of milk and a huge dose of tea. I also asked for some grass jelly and i got one small piece for 50 cents. Compared to all the other tea places I have gone this is by far the worst. If you want real milk tea go to teaspoon of bollinger and you will never come to tea heart again.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

< Review>
If they had good milk tea then I would ignore their awful service. But the classic milk tea taste quite bland as sh*t and pretty watery, even worse than the instant milk tea sold in the supermarket. The cashier tried very hard to ignore her customers and talked in a very low voice quickly and impatiently. I've seen she showed annoying face to 3 asian customers, even though herself is asian. Anyway, this is an unbelievable experience I've ever had in the US. Good luck to you guys!< /Review>

Priciest haircut I've had, but well worth it. Julia was my stylist and I felt that she really listened and expanded on my ideas. I very much appreciate the creativity. Glad to find a reliable salon.< /Text>

I am good with the price because I feel the service and result are worth it.
I've been going for over a year.  Their previous location at old Oakland was so convenient luckily they didn't move too far. I just  visited their newer Jack London location.  It is smaller but still quaint, lovely chairs,  natural aesthetic, and always so clean!  Monica is awesome and this salon is great!</Text>< Pictures>

I loved my experience at Manifesta! Julia was super patient, thoughtful, meticulous, and funny, and she gave me lots of good tips for styling my brand new 'do. I highly recommend and will definitely be back! (also, for other teachers worried about the cost: they offer a teacher discount! Just ask.)< /review>

<text>K.C. is hands down the best stylist I have ever had and creates such an enjoyable experience. Not only do you get a warm greeting from the other amazing stylists but a complimentary neck and shoulder rub as well. An awesome local business that really gives back and creates a very safe and welcoming environment for all to enjoy! I would definitely recommend and I have and now several of my friends are regulars. Go Manifesta!<//text>< user>

<review>I absolutely love Manifesta. I've been getting my hair cut here for over 2 years. I'm always extremely pleased. The environment is warm and welcoming. Plus, it means a lot to me that the Manifesta team cares deeply about social justice issues and gives back to the local Oakland community.<//review>< Rating>

I love Manifesta Salon. I have been going to KC for about 8 years now and she always responds with creativity and has a great eye for design. As a performing artist I need to look my best, I would feel so lost without KC.</Text>

This is a really fantastic salon, a community-minded, thoughtful and progressive enterprise in the heart of downtown Oakland.   It's one of those unique places that make our community great!  I look forward to my appointment every 4-5 weeks with KC as a chance to reconnect and feel great again.  Highly recommended.</review>

<review>I. Love. Manifesta. This is a delightful, conscientious, and lovely salon filled with kind people. Amy has been my stylist for four years and I don't know what I would do without her. She is one of the most creative, attuned, generous, and responsive people out there and I am so grateful to receive her wonderful services. I always love my haircuts and am eager to return.

Visiting Manifesta is a pleasure. It is a treat to be pampered in such a warm and welcoming space!</review><Rating>5<//Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Simone Hudson< /Name>< user_id>

This salon is fantastic! All of the ladies that work there are very talented, and all very friendly. They also have multiple appointment reminders, which I appreciate! Julia is great with short hair dos, which if you have one, or want one, you know/will come to find is hard to find!</text>

Lovely salon - a real attention to detail that I appreciate.  Beautiful products - I adore the way Aveda smells, and doesn't make me sneeze.  Great hair styling and color - I trust Jasmine implicitly.  Everybody that walks out the door looks great.  And yet - the place is very comfy.  Excellent experience.<//Review>

Ms. fabulous hairstyle was happy to tell me about Manifesta and their well...manifest.  I was intrigued, called and paired with Serena. I'm sooo lucky!  Manifesta and Serena are wonderful and always make my visits enjoyable. I have curly locks I leave natural most days but Serena makes them look gorgeous. She's very detailed and I've never had a better blow out and style. The salon has good energy and I feel relaxed when I'm there. Every time I leave I feel uplifted. The icing on the cake is this is an Aveda Salon with fair prices for top notch service. I'm so glad I found Manifesta and Serena.< /text><gmapID>0x808f80b6e2e8aa0d:0x693c91457639ec7c<//gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< UserId.>

Manifest is fabulous! Everyone there is so friendly, they go out of their way to provide great customer service on the phone and in person, and my haircut experience with Heather was wonderful! It's so relaxing to get a scalp massage first and Heather cut my hair exactly how I wanted it - something I actually haven't found in years. Thank you Heather and Manifesta! I'll be back soon:)</Review>

The very BEST Salon ever! My hair has seriously never been more healthy, shiny and well-styled! And, EVERYONE there is so welcoming and the vibe is so cool! Thanks KC and Crew...you are the BEST! Plus I like to buy a whoop whoop cookie  chocolate chip to eat while I am there. And, I have a Fluffy and Co wallet I like. Fridays there is the Farmers Market year round...five stars dude!</Text>

I love this salon! Amy does a wonderful job with my haircut, and she freely dispenses styling tips. Plus the salon is progressive, local, and sells sustainable products. Finally it's three short blocks from 12th Street BART, so it's super convenient.</review>

< Review>
I followed the owners from their previous positions in Berkeley and I have never been sorry.  Even the commute is easy -- a quick trip on BART.  The salon is a fantastic space, the stylists are extremely competent and great company.  I try to time my visits on Fridays to take advantage of the great farmer's market right outside their front door.  Plus it is great to support a local business in the now booming downtown Oakland.<//Review>

I cut a significant amount of hair off and she helped me determine the style that would work best for my busy morning routine. I felt the price was very fair for the service and quality.

The salon is very nice, modern, and comfortable - who doesn't want to kick their feet up while they get a scalp massage?!

I felt like I was in great hands from start to finish. I highly reccomend Manifesta and will be back every time I need a haircut or other service.< /Review><name>Kayce Bulla< /name><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Had my first experience at Manifesta a week ago and loved the outcome!  KC was my stylist and was wonderful taking the time to find out what I liked, what I didn't like, what I was thinking of doing, etc.  I would highly recommend this place!< /Review>

<text>I've never ever before felt as confident in a hair stylist to get it RIGHT as I do with Jasmine. Girl has cut bangs for me, given me a 'lob', and kept it simple with long layers. I love this place!< /text>< username>

I've been to Manifesta a few times and it's great. I have short fine hair and Amy does a really good job on it, and she also understands that I'm not going to spend a lot of time on my hair and gives me a cut that works with that. I like the overall chill vibe of the salon and love that they have Aveda products that smell amazing.</review>

<review>I have been going to Manifesta since it first opened. This salon is a gem of Oakland. They know what they are doing when it comes to hair - I've always been happy with cuts and color. They have also created a beautiful space, and actively contribute to their immediate neighborhood by selling goods of local craftspeople and hosting events.<//review><name>Barbara Haya< /name></record>

Want your hair pampered by folks who care about you, the planet and the community where they live and work?  Welcome to Manifesta.  I think I possibly experienced the best shampoo of my life and love the attention to color detail that was put into my hair.  Can't wait for my cut next month.< /text>

<Review>KC was the consummate professional, listening carefully and actively soliciting my input before, during and after the cut.  She does a fantastic job with short hair and you feel pampered and so positive afterwards, not just about your new look, but about the power of humans to make a difference in each other's lives, as they offer back concrete support to their clients' businesses as well.  Building community, one cut and client at a time. Support them and you'll feel good, while looking good too.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

She listens to my vision and always has ideas when I am not exactly sure what I want (which is usual)! I recommended her to my partner, and when we got engaged, I couldn't think of anyone else who I would want doing our hair. When I asked her if she was open to doing wedding hair, she not only said it was one of her favorite things to do, she also informed us that she does makeup as well. She is an artist at what she does, and we feel incredibly lucky to have had her there of our wedding day. We both looked GORGEOUS! Throughout our engagement as we were looking for other vendors, she pointed us in the direction of a photographer and a bespoke suit company. We now jokingly tell her she is our Wedding Fairy Godmother.< /Review></record>

***Update*** Sadly Manifesta closed. KC is now in another field (accounting!), the rest of the Manifesta folx are now at Elixir Salon in Rockridge. Sad to loose this great salon.***

(Original review) I love this place. I have short, curly hair with a lot of cowlicks, and KC always takes care of me. KC is great about talking to you about what your plans are for your hair and how to look cute during transitions.</review>

<text>I've reviewed Manifesta before - so I guess one more time won't hurt!  I followed KC Lutes here from Elixir in Berkeley years ago.  KC is an honest and authentic person first and foremost, so easy to work with.  I love the values she and her co-founders at Manifesta Salon practice - equality, inclusivity, justice, love and compassion, and their green business practices.  How fortunate I am to have a haircutter who listens to how I want my hair to be, supports my vision, and can skillfully execute the results!  There are no chemical fumes here, only good vibes, progressive ideas, and great people.  You won't regret going!< /text>< Name>

Really lovely salon. All the stylists are talented. I've personally been to both Amy and Mirena for cuts and color and both did excellent jobs. Nice selection of Aveda products but they don't try to up sell you. The salon also has cool local crafts and gifts for sale. So cool to see local businesswomen and artists supporting each other. Pricing is comparable to other upscale Aveda salons.</review>

I've been coming here since they opened two years ago, having followed Mireya from her former salon. Every time I come in for haircut, I feel like I'm treated like royalty. I'm always asked if I'd like something to drink, and Mireya is always on time. The receptionists are always very polite and forward-thinking. They always remind me of my appointments on email. And the haircuts! Did I mention the haircuts? With Mireya, I always feel like I'm being heard. She tells me what's realistic and how to best style my hair (without trying to sell me products). In between appointments, she welcomes me back, free of charge, for a bang trim. And the conversation between us is always interesting and easy. Although I will soon be moving an hour away, I still plan on coming back every six weeks. NO ONE cuts my hair better!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I live in bonita but prefer st pius as my church.  My entire family belongs and my niece's and now a nephew attends school there.  Although I've been asking for donation envelopes for some time.  I'll pay for them!< /Review>

This church does not allow taking pictures or video close to the seats, they only allow pictures and video from the second floor.  So, if you are trying to record memories of baptism, funeral, or wedding, you have to look somewhere else where they allow cameras close to the seats and not from the second floor.
Oh, and they don't tolerate babies either.  A single noise from a baby will have them you sent outside..  I see immediate families in a funeral being sent out because of a noise from the baby.< /Text>

The parishioners are warm and the Augustinian priest who looks Asian ( I think he is Fr. Ronnie ) was so down to earth and real and friendly to the parishioners after the Mass. I will attend Mass there often. I like the choir too.</Review>

great little wine bar in west portal. Intimate. Bar tending was extremely nice. We were celebrating so a bottle of champagne was a must. Decent food selections - the warm olives were REALLY spicy so we couldn’t eat them. Staff did the right thing and took them off the bill for us. Definitely would go back.<//text>

<review>Wine glass had dried lip marks ALL along the rim. 😳  Had to go up and ask for different glass.

Also, basically shooed us and another table out *the minute* they closed at 9 instead of allowing us to feel comfortable to finish our half glass of wine we had left (the guy stood next to our table until we finished and got up to leave...).

Nice ambiance inside though.< /review>< Date>

Though we use a high temperature glassware washing system, each piece should always be visually inspected prior to being served at the table.  What happened is not acceptable.  Also, I apologize if you felt rushed out the door.  Unless there are extenuating circumstances, we have the policy of keeping the lights on for our customers for at least 20 minutes past the posted closing time.  This will not happen again.  Please feel free to contact me directly if you'd like to discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\nJames\njames@vindebut.com"}</Resp>

It's a really nice wine bar. You can try a big variety of wine. They are not so expensive. Burrata and beet salad was amazing !!! Everything looks fresh and tasty !!! I like their customer service. It is a good place for spending your weekend.</review>

Really enjoyable time, with friendly staff and cool vibe but not a pretentious atmosphere.  Nice happy hour menu from 4-7pm with a lot of good appetizers on the menu.  An impressive wine list and selection of several local craft beers on tap which was a real treat.  A great addition to the West Portal retail district.   Only open from late afternoons onward.</text>

Cute wine bar with reasonable ambiance.  They have light fare available to go with the wine. Not the biggest selection of wines, but good enough. They also have beer and cider.<//Review>

The wine selection is excellent. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable!

Not to mention, some of the best food I've ever had and it's not even a restaurant! Compliments to the chef.< /Text>

One of the nicest wine bar in the area. I absolutely love the warm olives. I ordered the roasted Brussel Sprouts. It wasn't what-not roasted enough for my taste so I asked the Cheft to roast the sprouts for me. The Chef had a "can do" attitude and going the extra mile to roast my Brussel Sprouts more and loved it!  Th sprouts taste and the flavors combined, it's Devine. I like this place! Will be coming back!! Wine prices are reasonable. Love my wine, Textbook,Chardonnay from Napa really taste absolutely good! Thanks Margo for the recommendation!< /text>

<Review>The place is cute and they have some boutique/home crafted items.  They did a decent job with little direction, but they charged $70 for my tiny dog and didn't realize that even with the name "Chica" that she was a girl.  I asked them to "cut as short as possible for the summer" and this is the result.  They said "he had a great time" and gave Chica a camouflage bandana...but she's a girl.  For $70 I expect them to at least get that right.  I might try them again because they are small, local, and gave a decent haircut but I can't give them a glowing review.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4Dm9jfxlKI_J5PEVFQsQjfrU6RdXBCeHFlylY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

<review>Took my doberman Odin in for a grooming today and we both couldn't be happier.  Little buddy didn't even want to leave, he was literally jumping all over Shaw the groomer.  I can't believe how much he enjoyed it (he usually dislikes baths).  1rst time here, but definitely not the last.<//review>< Pics>

Great spot for dog grooming.
I just adopted a small dog from the shelter and he needed a hair cut.

I Called Doggie Ave, the person that answered the phone was very friendly and quoted a price that was very fair and in line with a couple of other places that I called.
I looked for a groomer in my area of Sherman oaks or North Hollywood but many places didn't answer or were closed on Monday.
I choose doggie Ave in Burbank

Luckily for me they had a cancellation and were able to fit me in that day.
what sold me was when I came in, I was greeted so nicely. Im a new owner to a long hair dog so this is a new experience for me.
It was a pleasure to have someone really listen to what I wanted done to my new dog.
They called me just as my dog Sammy was finishing so that he wouldn't have wait in a cage too long.

The hair cut shave that I asked for came out  awesome!!
THANKS!
Nice facility,  clean smelling, beautiful store with cute dog apparel and toys.
I will definitely be back.<//text>

<text>Couldn’t be happier! My little girl came home Literally smiling from ear to perfectly trimmed ear! I have a very shy papillon with a mild case of separation anxiety but Will took his time to love her and show her that she’s in good hands before I left. She came out cute as a button and happy as can be. Highly recommend 🐶💕< /text>< GmapID>

I am so happy to have found this spot!  A neighbor of mine recommended Doggie Avenue and she was right!  I got an appointment the same day.  The owners are so kind and obviously care a lot about dogs.  The shop has a family vibe and so much extra care was given to my dog than I've experienced with other groomers.  They took the time to make sure my Louie was comfortable before forcing any grooming and followed up with treats and love.  I highly recommend bringing your pup here for a bath and a cut!</Text>

Will never go here again. I came here with my mom and our two dogs and the owner was racist. When another costumer walked in that was of a lighter skin color, he "whispered" to her to keep her dog away from ours. Our pets healthy! Won't come here again besides we found another place that is friendly and it isn't expensive.</review>

That often means discouraging dogs from getting too close to one another. The idea that this was a result of bigotry is both ludicrous and hurtful. Doggie Avenue is an inclusive environment. We serve customers of all races and creeds, and we are proud of our very diverse staff. An accusation as serious as this one should never be made based on pure speculation.'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

Our dog doesn't mind going to the team here, when she was scared anywhere else. Will and the team do a great job taking care of the dogs and producing a great grooming experience.< /text>

Will was the guy who helped me, he had great customer service, and is a real true animal lover! The dog was scared, he was able to calm her down, gave her treats & pet her. Anyone who works with animals u would expect to be animal lover, but Will is way & beyond. He went as fas as saying he will help me find her a home. THANK U WILL!!!! I will make sure to come to you for service every time.

<text>If I could rate this place a ZERO I would have. My mother-in-law took her small dog here. Normally it takes only a couple hours to groom him, however the last time she was here they had her dog there for several hours and he was in a cage the whole time. He tried to get out of the cage and his paws were so bad she had to take him to the vet!  My mother-in-law is too nice, but she should have not only not paid for the groom but she should have called them to get reimbursed for the vet visit. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! They obviously don't care much about the dogs or about their human clients.<//text></record>

Doggie Avenue is a great place to bring your pet(s) for grooming. My dog is a mini Schnauzer and can be a bit of a talker... Will is usually at the front desk when we arrive.  Somehow, within the first couple of minutes of seeing her he is able work his magic to make her calm and happy in a place where no animal wants to be. For years I went to PetSmart, and I found time and time again my dog wasn't being care for or looked after the way I'd like. It would take 4-6 hours for them to complete a cut and bath. With Doggie Ave my dog is usually home within 2 -3 hours.  So, if you are looking for a local business feel, that does a great job caring for and trimming your pet, and doesn't break the bank, Doggie Ave is the place.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Doggie Ave. is the only place I would ever take my dogs or my client's dogs. They go far beyond being groomers. They care about the dogs. They are knowledgeable and also loving. Max was a mess. His owner had been ill for months.  Doggie Ave to the rescue! I walked in with Max and when I came back a few hours later Will was sitting on the floor with a dog and we started talking about Max and all of the sudden it dawns on me the dog with Will was little Max! He was so clean and his hair had been cut so nicely I didn't recognize him. What a handsome little guy Max was under all of his dirt and hair balls. Doggie Ave and the ppl there are my favorite and like I said I wouldn't take my dogs anywhere else<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOufvCU_tbDURbz93ukb3KOT4W2t6Kcxr7CDZ4u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

Came here straight after graduation from the Colegio Americano in Mexico City (1971).  I studied Geology and Art - painting the first 3 sessions, then ceramics the final 3.  Then had to go to Vietnam and the fun was done :-(  Pulled #44 in the lottery and called in July 1972.  From the Fat to the Fire!<//Review>< Pictures>

Outdated facilities and more importantly everyone is EXTREMELY rude, faculty AND staff. Good luck trying to find help there because whenever you ask there is CLEAR attitude. It’s almost like they are ungrateful that you are attending school there. Friends of mine wanted to transfer after 1 WEEK. That should say something. Some other students act ENTITLED and as if they own the school. No desire to upgrade student life or facilities. Stay away at all costs.< /review>

Really frustrating school. With about 2000 students overall you may think that while it is small it'll just be like any college but smaller. Not the case here. Lots of the students here are commuters which makes the school a ghost town after 4. I've found it to be like a community college that you cant leave if you're a resident. If you use a computer alot and require a decent network connection you're out of luck. At the beginning of the year my internet speed (WITH ETHERNET) was about 60 mbps. If you switch over to wifi you will get about the same. Pretty quick my connection got to be pretty much constantly lower than 10 mbps no matter what. You think that you could just go the the technology department and they could fix it but no. They have one guy in charge of the internet whom I have tried to have a meeting with and he was never there. All I got was the response that he "might be here tomorrow". ???? Isnt it his job to be there every day of the week? Just a really frustrating place.< /text>

<review>Lived in whittier for several years before moving in 2012. This year I went back to visit a relative and couldn't believe how much uptown has changed. Uptown use to be a lively place at night with people walking the streets and shopping but now its a whole other story. The only people I saw wandering the streets at night were homeless people. I also noticed that a lot of my old favorite restaurants have closed down. So sad.< /review>< userid>

Great school. Lots of opportunity for involvement in activities and getting 1:1 feedback from Professors. Attractive campus and cozy LA setting makes for significant opportunities to unwind when not studying. Library is amazing.<//text>

Gregory Salcido is a product of this school. He does not know history, and he does not know how to teach. He slams the most respected institution in our country, the military, while denigrating his own, public education which is probably the  most under appreciated. Sad</Review>

Your school is pathetic. You are an embarrassment to our country. California needs to suceed and fall into the ocean. Break away from the U.S. and do your own thing. Adios. You wont miss us, and we wont miss you!<//Text>

<review>I went to opening day for this year's football season, My 12 year old goes to Rio Vista Middle School, plays the trumpet and performed during the game. First impressions were of how well constructed and I really like the layout compares to how other stadiums are built. Also noticed how great the people and atmosphere was, great food too. My Son had a blast, his Mom and I had fun too. Would definitely be going back to watch My kid perform there in the near future.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80946588f59c955f:0x4d144838c57cf3db< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Wow, super nice, new stadium. VERY echo-y ☺ where we were sitting for a soccer game, so I felt like I was cheering really loudly without trying. 😉 Turf is FAST and slippery, so be ready, players. And, they were really cooking up some grub right as we left for something later that night - made me wish I could stay.<//text>< gmapID>

Great facility. Went to attend some track meets and graduations. There was security on site to assist with traffic flow and direct pedestrian traffic inside events. Felt safe.</text>

<Text>They have a lot there, and it's pretty easy to find what you need.
Little slow at the register, so be prepared to wait a bit if there are others ready to pay.

Friendly, well stocked, bit pricey but the quality of EVERYTHING is very high, so I get it.
Most excellent all around cake and candy supplier.< /Text><name>Bruce Shark</name>< response>

I have been going to this store for years. A new owner took over a couple of years ago but the store is pretty much the same. They have updated it. The inventory is good and you can find pretty much everything for cake & cookie decorating and candymaking.< /text>

I love going there. I feel totally at home. Such friendly staff and very knowledgeable as well.
They do great demos roughly once a month. And their cake decorating classes are a lot of fun too.<//Review>

The lady (not the owner) was helpful and friendly to me and the other customers. She was alone, but works efficiently! I drove an hour and a half to get there, they have a very nice selection, prices are moderate, and the store is organized.</review>

< review>
Everyone at this store is very kind and helpful. They are knowledgeable and nice to everyone. It sounds as though everyone is setting some sort of extremely high expectations. There are many people who spend a lot of time looking around in there, so if you need help, perhaps you could ask for it. I have learned so much from Linda and Syd, and don't have anything bad to say about any of them. A & J Cake Decorating is awesome!! :)</review>

< Review>
I've been going to this store for years. I stopped going because the owner in horribly rude!! I always thought it was in my head, lol, but after reading other reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks that. There is a lot to choose from, but the edible items are very mediocre. The quality of the "chocolate" is not very good. The variety of supplies is great if you're doing a kid project. It's not hard to screw up imitation  chocolate. But I'd rather go to a supply store that sells professional grade chocolate. The owner talks as if she knows chocolate, and I find it funny when I overhear her speak, because it's not even chocolate, it's basically  food dye, sugar and oil....yuk!! The owner should treat the customer more respectfully. After all, us measly customers are paying her bills!!!<//Review>

Today was the last straw for me with this place. I have been to this place on various occasions throughout the past two years for small items that I needed when in a bind and my supplier couldn't get it to me in time. And every time walked out empty handed and irritated. The sad part is I live 3 minutes away from this place and would rather drive to Rancho Cucamonga and shop at the candy supply store there then waste 1 penny on this place.

3 Reasons they received a 1 Star rating:

1) The store is small and very cluttered. The organization of the store will leave you wandering aroud trying to find everything.

2) All of the reviews about rudeness is true. The arrogance and inconvenience felt is very evident from everyone who works there.

3) This is the one that irritates me the most. The information given to customers in regards to Chocolate. I am not sure about their cake information they give out but as a professional chocolatier, I take great offense by the information they give their customers about chocolate. Merkins chocolate is in no way shape or form better than real chocolate. In a day when eating healthier is better and on the forefront of many peoples minds, Merkins chocolate which has 10+ ingredients (none of which are closely related to chocolate, in fact cocoa in most cases is not even an ingredient) is not better than the real chocolate which has at most 5 ingredients most of which is chocolate derivatives (i.e. cocoa powder, cocoa liquer, etc.) and the taste is WAY much better then the Merkins stuff. Also, with real chocolate and the Merkins "chocolate" you can add real ingredients into it for flavoring  (i.e. liquor, real fruits and such) unlike what the class tells you where "nothing can be added to chocolate except for oils because it will seize up" Wrong Wrong Wrong!!!

When a customer asks "How long will it take for the chocolate to set after dipping?" Don't answer, "Depending on room temperature, it should take no more than 5 minutes" Any type of chocolate, Merkins or the real deal cannot set properly at temps higher than 73 degrees, especially here in California. We don't have to worry about humidity as much but chocolate will take forever if at all to set at higher temperatures. Room Temperature is not a correct answer, in fact it is a very generalized answer that can and will ruin the chocolate confections you make if taken in the wrong context.

If you are here for cakes have fun, if you are here for chocolate turn around and run.</Text>

It's bar food but not a greasy spoon type of place. Glad this iconic place was not a victim of COVID.</Review>

Went a few days ago because a friend wouldn't stop talking about it. We went together during breakfast and I got the roughneck that comes with eggs, pancakes, sausage, fries, and bacon, it was alright. Nothing outstanding about it, the pancakes were all fluff and no flavor. That was my only gripe.< /Text>

The bugers are good sized and meaty. I'm not a huge fan of the fries however and the onion rings are awesome. The beer selection is pretty good and they offer a giant sized 32oz optionif you're having one of those days. overall good food, good people, and a cool environment make this place worth checking out.<//Text>< response>

This is my favorite spot. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. The service is great, the food is tasty and the beer is ice cold.

It’s not a fancy spot but it’s comfortable and reliable and local family owned and operated.

During covid, they’ve worked super hard to stay open and they’ve adapted and utilized their patio area and done what they can to limit capacity and contact.

Pre covid, they have 2 separate indoor dining areas, tv’s for sporting events, they often have live music, they will host events, and of course they have a patio.< /Review>

We were there for breakfast, so we ordered an egg sandwich with portabella mushroom and homestyle potatoes with onions and bell pepper and some apple pancakes. The egg sandwich and the potatoes were super delicious, not greasy and perfectly seasoned. The pancakes were good and really fulfilling, but next time I will pick something else instead of pancakes.

<Review>One of the most delicious burgers I every had...
I didn't get anything exotic, just a plain burger. They call em 'Curly Burgers'. For the same price as a fast food combo I had a scrumptious 1/2 lb of fresh cooked beef.
Oh, did I mention that the fries were  BOMB, BOMB<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBcK26fmsWDgO8tESEvszovJAI9g3T_TQHOs4E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< username>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I go to many restaurants but here I go the most. The crew is very amicable and the food they place on your table is so fresh and tasty. I would always prefer to have a nice meal in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.<//Review>

American comfort food! Not to mention, the Moose Drool on tap. Always a bonus for those that like brown ales. Nothing on the menu has disappointed me. Excellent service, excellent quality! Highly recommended!< /Text>

Ice cold beer. The small beers are large and the large beers are so big I can barely finish one. Food is greasy and delicious -exactly as you would hope bar food is!! Courteous staff, old bar feel, and a patio. Awesome happy hour prices too!< /text>

Friendly staff, good beer and food selection, and a fun vibe.</text>

I wanted to share a history I I have with Curley or as we used to call it Curley's. My mother, Odette, used to cook here in the 1930's!  As a child, I performed with Disney and did appearance with Bob Hope and Danny Kaye. We ALWAYS went by Curley's after the appearances for a burger and Shirley Temple for me! A true institution, with the best customers around! BTW, Odette was fired one night for having a drink behind the bar at closing time, but she was hired back the next day!</Review>

<Text>Having lived just down the road from this Signal Hill institution for more than 15 years, it's odd that only after having moved a few miles away I would be drawn in to routinely dining here.  So, what's up you ask? For years  My parents and some good friends of theirs have made Wednesday evenings at Curley's apart of their routine. Although often invited, It was so routine that nothing seemed pressing about joining them. That was until my fine folks retired to Oregon and now seeing them was far less often and no longer on a whim the way I was used too. So, when they came to town and were wrapped up in catching up with old friends you can bet that Wednesday evening they were heading to Curley's. This was an invite I couldn't pass up, and now more than ever understand how good company, along with excellent food, served by one heck of a personable waiter named Jason and awesome live entertainment for a reasonable amount were so compelling. This is traditional diner food served in portions and prepared in a way you don't find often these days. The entertainment is usually a duet banjo and tuba with vocals from both mixed in. Usually American standards from the 1920's (roaring 20's) with sing a longs (lyrics provided to every table), the crowd of anywhere from 20 to 60 people are welcoming and a jovial bunch, and the atmosphere is so infectious it's impossible to imagine anybody not joining in for a thundering chorus of "she'll be coming round the mountain, when she comes". On evenings when the duet isn't available they are covered by the likes of a very talented Barbershop Quartet, or a sit in artist. But if this kind of "all in" audience participation live entertainment isn't exactly your thing, no need to hesitate; the front dining room and bar are left to the charms of what ever commentary patrons may have to what ever sports game is being aired on the TV monitors where there is no expectation of participation. The food and service are well worth giving Curley's a try. I regret waiting over 15 years to find out.</Text>< user_id>

I hadn't been there in years.  The food was good, bloody mary was very good and the ambiance and customers were relaxed and friendly.  I can't wait to go back.  Prices are typical for area.  Not real expensive.  Enjoy.  I did.  Oh and it has working oil well in the parking lot.  Classic Signal Hill.<//review>

They have a great staff!  The event I attended was a private party, but it was set up to fluidly move around the bar without issues.  Everyone was really friendly.  The live music was pretty great, too.  Their guitarist really captured the feel of 70s to 90s rock.  We had an amazing time and plan to go back.  The parking lot was a little small, but there's a lot of parking in the strip mall next door.</review>

I adore this little hideaway.. It's a classic spot, and it gives ALMOST a dive vibe, which I like... The beers are cold and the wings are tangy! I've been here at least a dozen times. Once, my appetizers came still half frozen which was a bummer but only once I was ever disappointed. Good service, cold beer and that old joint atmosphere.<//Review>

<Review>This place looks kinda like a biker place from the outside. But when you get inside you realize that it IS kinda like a biker place. Food is great. Burgers and such. And a nice long wooden bar to sit at and have a cold beer or mixed drink.< /Review><user_name>M. Reed< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

<text>The hamburger was really flavorful. Not like planks of brown they serve up most places. Also we had the fish tacos. 3 with freshly grilled fish. Also very good.

It's been there forever. Can't miss the oil donkeys in the parking lot.</text>< pictures>

<text>I usually come here for breakfast which is amazing-the chili cheese omelette is one of my favs.  But if you want lunch, you can order a lunch item for breakfast as well.  The patty melt with a side of onion rings hits the spot.  Solid yummy comfort food.  Cool staff as well.< /text>< Pictures>

We had a party of four adults and one child last evening. The food is always great, as my wife and I eat there often. We love Curleys; however, looking at my bill this morning, I noticed that they added an 18% gratuity to our bill of $91.16 or a total of $106.15, with tip.
Usually a tip is added for party’s of 8 or more and is stated on the menu. The waiter never told us there was an automatic tip added and I gave my usual 20% tip on top of $106.15.
I feel the waiter should have told us of the automatic tip. What restaurant automatically adds an 18% tip for only 5 people?
Everyone better check his “Curleys Bill” for the automatic tip. I know I will.......that is why the One Star Rating.</text>

<review>'Mr. Hitchcock, owner of 2H Construction and Curley's Cafe in Signal Hill, has been coaching girls' soccer at Stanford Middle School for one year.  Hitchcock's sixth grade and eighth grade daughters are involved in soccer, basketball and track at Stanford. So Hitchcock knows personally the profoundly positive influence middle school sports can have on young lives.  It is for this reason that Hitchcock has so generously offered Curley's as a location to host this event.  For Hitchcock's community service I believe Curley's deserves a great review. Information about the event can be found here</review>< user>

<Review>This used to be an old biker bar, but now it is just old! The decor hasn't changed and the crowd is substantially an old crowd. That being said, I ordered a 32 oz beer that was very cold and a $11 hamburger that was pretty damn good. It is a 3 star bar with an extra star for descent food and very cold beer. FYI, if it is a busier night, parking stinks in the crowded , small parking lot.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Full disclosure: I play in a traditional/dixieland band at this establishment as a guest musician on Monday evenings. My wife accompanies me and enjoys a delicious meal and conversation with other diners who come to enjoy the music. The server on Monday nights who attends to the needs of guests on the music side of the cafe is top notch. She is friendly, fast and very helpful in making sure everyone is satisfied and is a credit to her employer.<//Text>< Rate>

Ya know what, I've passed by this place so many times as a kid and I finally went inside to try it out. I gotta say, it exceeded my expectations. I love the corned beef sandwich, though I hate having to keep asking them for sauerkraut to turn it into a proper reuben; just offer a reuben already!< /review>

It looks enticing from the outside, but when you get in there it's so hot I mean have you heard of an air conditioner? So besides being sticky and humid we went outside those nice was a nice breeze we ordered two delicious Bloody Marys. Well the Bloody Mary's were far from bloody they were shity Mary's might as well as tap water and a tiny hint of V8.

So the bill was like 50 bucks we got one appetizer it was soggy quesadillas the only thing they had going for them honestly it was the onion rings I'm going to give them that things are delicious! Other than that nasty< /Review>

Surprisingly pretty food with big hearty portions. Not the most appealing decor inside n out and more of a bar restaurant then cafe. Variety of items from breakfast to dinner and appetizers. Beer is served here and Curly's also has plenty of TV'S 2 watch sports n news.</Text>

Well, its a diner and bar with TV's.  The food is medium quality diner food, but the service seems to always be good.  This is NOT the place you visit for anything resembling a culinary experience,  but rather basic food so you don't go hungry!< /Review>

<Text>Great food, decent prices, good service.
The Bistro burger, and Curly's morning martini are amazing. Would definitely recommend if you're in the Long Beach/Signal Hill area.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) To start parking is another independent business and you have to pay $ 100 pesos if you want to use it.
The policy of the place is that they do not serve alcohol before 2; 30pm ... BS
