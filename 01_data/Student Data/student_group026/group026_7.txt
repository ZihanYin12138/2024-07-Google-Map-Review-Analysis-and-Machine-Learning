Went in for an upgrade and everyone was so friendly the rep that helped me, Yami, was very helpful, answered all my questions and helped me get a better deal for me and my family. Walked out very happy with my iPhone 12 Pro Max =D. Definitely recommend and definitely coming back to this location.< /Text>

They say to email them to resolve the problem but will never respond to your email

This is the closest store to my house and it's been 5 months that they still cant take my sprint payments... yet they can add phones and accessories to my account but cant take a payment? Making me drive to another city to do my payment. Bad service.

4/12/21
Once again a huge let down. I needed my phone upgraded today after I get out of work at 6. I waited in line for 35 min. They "tried" to get into my sprint account and said they cant. Wasted another 25 min. Cant even make it to another location. Unprofessional. Staff is very uneducated on their job.</Review>

I asked about the promotions they got and the guy had told me that the only promotions is when you port over a number. I asked if there was any promos for just a new number and account and he very rudely said "everything I just said is what we got". On top of everything we couldn't even go inside. So I left and went to the tmobile off of bear Valley rd and ended up getting a new iPhone 11 pro max which they had on promotion when you activate a new line. All in all, I would not recommend this place to anybody unless you want to wait outside with a rep that does not even know his own promotions.< /Review><user>117249455015753925182< /user></record></dataset><record>

<review>Amazing customer service! The environment was welcoming and the staff was very friendly. It felt like a friend was helping me out as there was that human connection that was made. The process was a breeze and the gentleman that assisted me was very lively and upbeat, which made the experience the best. He even played my favorite band in the store and made good conversation as he was setting my new phone up. I have to say that this experience was very unique and positive and I’d gladly return to this location. I got my first iPhone, the Iphone SE and I absolutely love it! It’s simple and easy to use. It’s not too big like most phones and the price was great for an iPhone. It works smoothly and perfectly. I am a very satisfied customer! :) Thank you !< /review>< pictures>

Our first experience with T-Mobile and could not be happier, Daniel's customer service  was excellent, very friendly  and always had a smile on his face. His knowledge and personality  is what keeps customers coming back.<//review>

As a paying costumer I should not have to call two separate stores to find out what is in stock. Although the employees at this store are normally very polite they lack knowledge and do not seem as eager to help as other stores (Hesperia). For this reasons and more I prefer to deal with the heavy traffic in Hesperia, and deal with the drive going out of town instead of dealing with this place. Almost as If I am dealing with completely different companies......sort of frustrating!

Went to the store just to purchase a simple screen protector and a case for my phone on November 18th, the total amount led up to $86.18. On the day of the purchase they charged me twice saying it was not going through. When I completed the purchase after the second attempt, and came back to work I verified in my account how much the purchase totaled and saw that they had charged me twice!!
The funny thing is, they actually took the money, TWICE!!
I called back the same day and they said the money would be refunded after the second business day. It is now November 25th and still no refund. I called the store a second time and a spoke to a Sales associate named Daniel who made the situation even worse. Had the audacity to elevate his voice to my mom saying they cannot refund my money and could only give me store credit. So if anybody shops here, check your account because after this experience they left a bad stigma on themselves. NEVER SHOPPING AT A T-MOBILE AGAIN!!!< /text>

This place is ridiculous Everytime I go there their computers are down and it takes over an hour just to order a screen protector replacement. Today I went to add a line, spent 1 1/2 hours doing that. The phone did not work when I got home. Had to call customer service and spend an additional hour trying to figure out why the phone didn't work. It was never activated. Beyond ridiculous!!!< /Review>

<Text>I would like to express my gratitude to Ivy. We were having issues trying to transfer service from another carrier onto the T-Mobile network, but she was determined to resolve the issue. She went far above and beyond my expectations. Even though the store had been closed for nearly 2 hours before we got everything squared away, she worked diligently to get it working! She was extremely helpful and patient during the whole process and I feel that she should be given the appropriate recognition that an employee that goes the extra mile deserves. Way to go, Ivy! 5 Stars!< /Text>< pictures>

Waste of time. First called to check, then drove to store and I get a different story. they also lie to. They did not want to sell me a phone.  Reasons why T-Mobile is not good for you. I guess they don't want to make money.<//Text>

Service was non-existent. I didn't bother to give the waitress a tip. Sushi was 5/10 in flavor, presentation, and selection. If you just want quick, okay sushi then come here. If you want to have a nice experience with good sushi then choose else where.< /Text>

<review>Disclaimer: I'm not a Sushi expert and we generally get the vegetarian / imitation crab Sushi.
No frills restaurant with an acceptable ambiance, quick service, and good value for money.
We've come here a few times and have found everything pretty good. The 5 stars are not necessarily for the food, but rather because I found this provides excellent value for money.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Service is good, food is decent, but sashimi is terrible. Do NOT order sashimi here. It is cut horribly and fish was served frozen. The chef obviously doesn't have proper training or a proper knife, even. Our rolls were pretty good, but lacking in quality seen in other sushi restaurants. Emphasis is definitely on quantity. It was ok, overall, but I would not come back because of the dissmal shashimi experience.</text>

<Text>Polite staff with available seating even at lunch time. Process seemed appropriate. The sushi Bar is available and features the typical boats going on circles.  They seem to understand that not trough must be clean.
There are about 8 tables you can sit at and benefit from menu and waitress (I'm not being chauvinistic, many trips and I've always only seen the same nice lady).
If the place isn't busy and you choose the bar, don't complain about the service. They of course don't commit to floating a lot of boats, so it helps to just tell the guy you're interested in salmon, Rolls or whatever.
So far, I'll keep going there< /Text>< Pics>

Grace is super friendly and sweet.
I’ve gone to a lot of places but nothing compares to Sushi King in Milpitas.
They are cheaper then the others and also tastes way better.
I love Sushi King.
Wish there were more locations.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Sushi King was good, but lately their presentation and taste has not been the greatest.

Mostly not a lot if patrons there and the floating bar doesn't work which is kind of a turn off.

Overall, the price is decent and if you haven't had sushi or your don't have a fancy tasting buds it should be good.</Review>

Honestly, don't let these bad reviews suede you from coming here. It's not that bad. Maybe not the world's best shushi but it isn't bad. 7/10.</Text>

Sushi was just ok service..what service? I ordered salmon teriyaki but I was given chicken teriyaki. Went with my daughter and friend, all three of us had upset stomachs after eating here.
I wouldn't recommend this place.<//Review>

I'm very thankful they are open between 2pm and 5pm - most sushi and noodle places are closed between lunch and dinner, but here I can finally get my fix! Sushi tastes good, and I would say it is reasonably priced.

Other places might have better sushi, but if you need a quick fix at a reasonable price (especially from 2pm-5pm), this is the place to be!</Review><user_id>117802948582077482996</user_id><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Meh food, but you got to love the small area. You see it for what it is.

I had visited the restaurant two times. The first time our meals took awhile, but the food was good. The second time I came around a busy day during lunch hours and ordered a Salmon Sashimi. The salmon was still a bit icy and it was flavorless. Added to injury the cost was close to $30. Definitely not worth it.<//Text>

Very rude service!!! I went in late for dinner. I was browsing through the menu trying to decide what to eat. The impatient old lady there insisted that I make the order immediately as they were closing! I should not have gone there if I had known I would be treated like this! You should give this place a miss!!! Their food wasn’t great either.< /Review>

<review>I ordered sushi to go. After I ordered I checked the reviews and became concerned. But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness of the sushi, it's comparable to other more highly rated places I've eaten at.</review>< user>

Sushi was very good and quiet atmosphere. What i didnt like is that the waitress took the man's order who was also Asian but took mine second. I came in before him and she passed my table only to help him first. That was rude....no hi or I'll be with you in a moment. Also....sushi maker made food with no gloves so def had to pray over my food but otherwise gd. If you're not picky like me and like your food as is then cool...i needed modifications because the descriptions didnt explain everything.  All that aside, was gd food and drinks. Plum wine was delicious!<//Text>

<Review>Lacking Hospitality.  I felt very unwelcomed as we walked in. It was like they where mad. We went there because and it was very convienent when shopping we tried it 2 other times. Another time i took my nephew but, the food still wasnt that good and still felt very unwelcomed. HOW CAN u enjoy a meal with you feel like your bothering them. Also, The food was not that good its not worth it.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I didn't expect much, but was still disappointed. I got the sushi take-out box D. The ngiri was tasteless, and the spicy tuna roll was not what I expected; more like "fish mush" than spicy tuna. Came with a tiny amount of soy sauce. I was starving when I ordered. I ate as much as I could stand, then gave up. I've never had sushi so disappointing, and I eat sushi in Utah.</review>

I've given this place a shot several times and every time I find the food mediocre at best. I'm going to skip next time. I think people agree becsuse this place was pretty empty during rush hour lunchtime.

The food is poor and expensive but the service is ok.< /text>

<Review>Maybe I caught them on a bad day.
Got $17 sushi platter.
Tuna had no flavor and little color.
Salmon was a lil tough.
I was hoping it would be better than it was.< /Review>< Pictures>

I am disappointed. What happened to this restaurant? I ordered sushi from here three times previously. Each time the quality was consistent. Today my husband ordered through a third-party food delivery application, and the seafood on the sushi was rotten. Salt was abundant on it to cover up the foul smell and taste. We will never order from here again. From now on, Sen Dai will continue to get our business.< /text>

Wonderful place to eat. Ordered caldo de birra de res, the meat was tender, enough meat, soup is flavorful with a sideof rice, tortillas, limes... I order a fish fillet plate. Portions are great. Flavors were great. When you walk in the decor it cool! The place is clean.... and beautiful... thank you to the cook!!</review>

They serve first-rate dishes, their menu is rich, The chef in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The dishes are consistently fresh, the attitude towards the visitors  is efficient. I often go to  this restaurant and I was never disappointed. Highly recommended.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I was eating at subway, seen the guy that is supposedly the owner go and harass people in the back. Also I tried the fish tacos and they are not good. Do not come here lol everything is way to expensive. Also I didn’t like how he was harassing the homeless lady in the back, casa gazacon is 1 star and over priced.</review><Date>1573796362327< /Date>< Pictures>

This place was highly rated on Yelp. I liked it but I would have liked it more if the food would have been spicy. I got the Chile Verde plate and it tasted great but needed some spice. We also ordered the huevos con chorizo. They were okay. We asked for milk for the coffee but they said they didn't have any.</review>

So the first time sucked but for some reason I gave it a 2nd chance. I ordered a ceviche tostada to go and they didnt even give me a tostada. Weird. They're mediocre go to sabor baja or el paisa down the street for better mariscos and service. Unfortunately everywhere else was closed when I went or I would have never settled for this. The lady has a bad attitude for no reason by the way, I know they're going to read this and I know they're not going to change or care just thought I'd put this out there.< /review>

Called to place an order. Lady put me hold & never came back. I called back but got a busy signal. Finally got thru & ordered a carne asada burrito. Burrito was mostly beans, meat was full of nerves & cartlidge. Nasty, didnt even continue eating it. Bad service & bad food.<//Review>

<Date>1566344742384</Date><username>Julian Cereceres< /username><Text>I've been parking the same car I use to get to and from work in the same exact stall for a little over year in my apartment complex. I've been on leave from work for 2 weeks now and they towed my car for abandonment. When I called to speak to a manager he asked me "What do you want?" And I when I explained the situation he told me "Just pay the fee" then hung up on me. They did place a warning sticker on my car on the back windshield even though I was reversed into a bush. There was no way I could see the warning sticker passing by regularly, they hid the sticker from plain sight.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><rate>1< /rate><userid>116708658026077180299< /userid>< GmapID>

<Review>The guy was rude not to mention my son got his window broken out after they took his car, they charged my son 500 hundred bucks to get his car out and they only had it less than an hour.. Be careful where you park your car cause they had a parking permit and still they got there car towed and the guy had to have already been at the spot where we were cause we had just barley got there when someone came and told us they took my sons car. This was a horrible experience and they will over charge you more than its worth
Now after paying 500 bucks to get the car out now he has to pay for a broken window that happened after Sierra Towing took his car and the guy said he wasnt paying for it cause he didnt do.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Extremely rude! My moms car was towed and her mediation and purse were in the car. She just wanted the info on what she needed to do to be able to get the belongs out of the vehicle. The guy who answered the phone basically said he didn’t care her diabetes medication was in there, he’s not releasing anything. She wasn’t asking him to do anything to risk his job. She just wanted whatever information was necessary to start working on getting the car released or getting at least her belonging. She was even willing to pay whatever their fees were. (Which she did and paid $132) just to get her purse out the car! Both the guys she spoke to were rude! Both Matt and John!!</text>< userid>

When I called and talk to the manager, Mark, he was not professional about and did not seemed to care. Oh well, just trying to help them from a big accident.

< Review>
These guys towed my truck a day after the notice said it would be towed. So I thought I was in the clear....just filled up and was inside for 20 minutes...engine was warm. Windows down. Paperwork and coffee on the dash. So... Getting towed because it was abandoned is BS. However, I decided to let the lien take place. The cars they have for sale are cheaper than the tow and storage fees. They ended up be cool once I talked about the situation. Still wouldn't release my truck though. LoL.</Review>

The guy who helped me Friday was awesome very friendly n understanding of what I was going thru.  As i was getting my property he didnt hover or rush me as it was already after 5.  It was a truly amazing experience considering what was going on anyone in need of a friendly and courteous tow truck driver should call Sierra's Towing.</text>

Towed my car from my apartments said the were stickers on there didn’t have no impressions of having a sticker on there blamed rain and tentants there aware that take off stickers should send a extra notice to your unit if they know that overall tho they were pretty cool took $120 off supposedly cause I really didn’t see it paid $229 was suppose to be $350 seem like they kinda make there own prices so just watch the way you talk to them cause they can overcharge you if they want<//text>

They will tell you something else on the phone and when it comes to charging, they will charge you double the amount. Please beware of this company. Also the employees working in this company are super rude. When you ask them that the price doesnot match of what they were telling you the previous day, Supervisor started telling some california laws that a person has not even heard in their lifetime. Also the tone that the supervisor and the person spoke was so unprofessional. Please beware of this towing company before you go to them.</Text>< pics>

<review>This is one of the lower class tow company's I have had to deal with. Their professionalism is seriously lacking. And seems they don't follow any of the laws or respect the people that keep them in business. Most of their business comes from hiring criminal auto thiefs. Or at least train their employees to become such. These drivers wait until hard working people are fast asleep, usually around 3am.and sneek around Fresno steeling cars knowing very well people have to get up and go to work the next day.... Then charge outrageous prices to get their cars back.<//review><Rating>1</Rating><userid>108517270278125521190<//userid><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Towed my car for parking in a red zone. That's fine. However they charged me $350 before they even had my car for 24 hrs. While speaking on the phone the guy was rude and condescending. I see these guys come into apartments every night. Their heads are swiveling looking for anything to tow and take advantage of.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Customer service was great!! Driver did a quick job and got my vehicle to my destination in a timely matter. However, i called a day before to schedule a next day pick for an appointment at the dealer. And I had to reschedule my appointment from early morning to mid day because tow truck came almost an hour after the scheduled time.</review>

<Review>This is one of the most awful companies I’ve ever dealt with. The manager is horrendous to speak with and adds fees on at a whim without any notice. My car was in the lot for a day and I was charged $600< /Review>< Time>

I would NOT recommend this place to anyone with medium to longer hair and needing layers. I went to this place to cut my long hair to shoulders length and get layers. My hair stylist was named Nick. He didn’t even wet my hair and used a razor (not scissors) to cut off the majority of my hair. He rushed the layers in a couple minutes. His cuts were not precise and were uneven. I ended up with an extremely choppy cut. He seemed really nervous cutting my hair and as if he did not know what he was doing. His previous male clients seemed rushed too and their fades did not look smooth. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Instead, I would go to the Supercuts on Shaw and Villa in Clovis. They fixed my bad hair cut and made my hair presentable.< /Text>

Sandra did an Amazing job ! Everyone is Super friendly! My haircut came out better than I ever expected! I have been to many places from high-end place with high price to cheaper places with plenty of experience and no one has cut my hair as good as Sandra did. I think I found my place. 10/10 will be coming here everytime for all my hair needs:)</review>

<Text>The professionals here are extremely knowledgeable, and know their products and styles extremely well. I went in for a haircut, but wasn't sure what to get. When the cosmetologist suggested different types of cut and styles that fit my typed hair, I had a better idea of what I could get done. It came out amazing. They also offer military and student discounts as well. I was inane out in less than 30 minutes. I'll definitely be returning in the future.</Text>< gmapID>

Ive been to many supercuts and they could never get my haircut right but at this location they finally did. The hairstylist Priscilla is the only one i will let cut my hair, she takes her time and makes sure that it is perfect. I only go to this one and its because of her. So if you go, ask for her and you wont be disappointed.</Review>

If I could give a negative rating I would. I went in for a bang trim, worst experience ever. Do not bother coming here if you are wanting a decent hair cut. Spend a couple extra dollars and go to a professional.</Review>

There is a difference between the two and I wouldn't be upset if you told me you could do a skin fade when I first ask, but then when I describe it to you at the end you "oh, all I can do is the "zero". Fine, you gave me the zero, but that in no way means to start cutting BELOW MY EAR LOBE! YOU DIDNT JUST TAKE MY SIDEBURNS, YOU TOOK PART OF MY BEARD. Then, to top it all off, I asked for a high and tight. A high fade, not a mid fade which you then proceeded to blend in the top half of my head into a square cut... worst experience with a haircut ever. Would not recommend, go elsewhere to get your money's worth.</text>< time>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>I go to Supercuts often, but my preferred location was under renovation, so I went the the First/Bullard location. The cut wasn't bad, but she really didn't listen to what I wanted, and when I tried to make myself clear, she really didn't respond, and did what she wanted. I ended up with a haircut that was OK, but not what I wanted, and I'm disappointed.

I suppose I could have them recut it, but if they didn't listen the first time, what makes me think that they will listen the second time through? I'll try to live with it for a couple of weeks and try to find someone else to cut it.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Horrible haircut. I showed a picture of the haircut I wanted and I got nothing close to it. And the stylist insisted that it was my miss communication that was the problem for my haircut. He faded my hair way to high and he messed up where my cowlick was. My hair is jacked up. I just shaved everything. After all the hassle they said I could he two dollars off my bill.....wow thanks for butchering my hair.<//Text><username>Erickson Schafer<//username><GmapID>0x80945d4173274b8b:0x742bb89da49571fa< /GmapID><user>102206124682884039214<//user></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was dying for a sundae and knew DisFruta had great Thrifty ice cream but I could not have imaged how amazing my sundae would be!  Fresh banana, strawberries and whipped cream not to mention the cherry on top!  Everything I’ve ever had from this place has been great. Highly recommended!< /review>< Pics>

<text>I came here for agua nieve, agua de pepino and I found it! They also have more food that are some of my favorites. From Chamango, duros, a variety of aguas, tortas, and the list goes on. I was also amazed that they have a station to similar to starbucks but instead it has bottles of chile, limon, and other things you may want to put on top of your chips, duros, and fruta. the service was great. I was greeted and asked if I had any questions. The prices are great as well. I will come here again when I make my trip up here for when I go hiking and need to grab a healthy meal. Right across the street is also a dulceria just in case you want to pick up some mexican candy.</text><UserId.>109349338289546587902< /UserId.><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLsvYq5_-SQJNlLYCh3crOP4VgUakTrUyvDy5r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4MLY3sa3XxS5OfmoYv7OHaSVyOCWBEOKTiZkM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu9X0RIleXAirdzC9_vQnDBmTTh-_M5PtLDZF5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnZ4hSB7eMMRRo9nBiUXRGiNWbx5VhbpUraW2L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZjBSHHUJfuA3R-nIOC48mavm1m-lzMtoI8cdD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvhrHWt8ytqSG97ER7qVuCrAVDkVaMyjVjnZqs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVaOZRQCl6xUmN-A9u3JylsbnrTWkKYCY-fTQF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Date>

< Review>
Nice interior they had a tv playing Disney shows for the kids. They have a great selection of drinks and ice cream this time only ordered fruit salad (Bionico). Parking is an issue but can also park on the side. Will most likely come back for the other drink choices.<//Review>

Great prices and even better food. This place is a hidden gem in San Marcos. Don't take my word for it, head on over and try something yourself. You won't be disappointed.< /text>

placed an order thru ubereats by error and cancelled it in less than a minute. I still got charge for it, apparently because disfruta had already started on the order. I LITERALLY CANCELLED IN LESS THAN 1 MINUTE. I don't see how they would have started on the order if they usually take 10 minutes to prepare. the order was for 3 items a tostiloco, mangonada, and a diablito. My wife had already ordered these items on the same day, so the 2nd order was placed error and cancelled immediately but still got charged. If you ever going to order from this place do it in person and not by Ubereats. I feel that Disfruta should have cancelled the order on their side without charging anything because the order was cancelled IMMEDIATELY after placing it.</Text>

The most scrumptious variety of authentic Mexican ice cream awaits for you at this place. I loved that is family owned-operated and was impressed with the large variety of flavors for such a small shop. AP Score: Amazing!!!</text>

<text>I have tried mixteca, michoacana, angelitos, and ocean rainbow but oh my gosh by far this is my go to place. The people there are beyond friendly and get the order right every time the first time. You can taste the freshness of everything from the ice cream to the fruit salads and even the chicharines. I can honestly say I love this place and I can gaurentee you will too. 😊😊< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

Other patrons = friendly and mind their own business. Age group 30-50.
Drinks = cheap
Food = Nice
They have a pool table, darts and a jukebox.
The place looks shady but the people are nice and sweet. Smoking is allowed inside.
During the SuperBowl they had a lot of free food and they gave out 2 Jersey’s to the lucky draw winners. Overall its a great place to grab a beer if you live nearby.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Discreet hole in the wall dive bar.  Showed up for some beers on Sunday evening but left after obnoxious karaoke took hold.  Great people and atmosphere.< /Text>

Careful who you talk to because some people can't hold their alcohol here and will start with their BS 😣😒. I came 2 nights in a row and both nights something happened 🤦. The staff is really cool and the ambience (aside from the drama) is cool. A little smokey so if you have breathing problems I'd suggest you skip this spot.<//review>

<review>It's a whole in the wall type bar. The beer selection is minimal, but good place to go if you want to casually hangout with friends. Would not recommend if you don't like the smell of cigarette smoke on your clothes when you leave the place.<//review></record>

<Text>I was really hoping they had dining seating was disappointed when there wasn’t. Was visiting from out of town and wanted something quick but different. Seeing that they had their pizza wheel where you are able to choose different toppings for each slice of pizza. Genius!!! Pizza was nice and cheesy, enough topping, crust was crunchy and soft at the same time. The Breadsticks were over baked super crunchy could eat them - reason for the 4 stars. Staff was great.</Text>< pics>

Both food and prices are good.  Place is not much to look at (take out only), but they have a variety of pizzas with a great variety of toppings.</text>

I love this place ..everyone leaving poor reviews got mental problems because I BEEN around years even when it was called piarra pizza and never had an issue..I always said I couldn't work at a place where I had to deal with the public..im pretty sure this is the public I'm talking about hahaha<//review>

<review>I always call to place my order before they go their new management I never had a problem everyone was polite and it was fast I was in and out but now they can’t seem to get my order right they always mess it up and I have to wait for them to remake my order and every time I call they’re so rude over the phone. I’ve tried telling them and no one ever listens to anything I have to say or when I tell them my order was wrong I’ve had them look at me like I’m stupid or I made a mistake!!!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Ordered chicken korma, sag pander, garlic naan, and basmati rice for delivery. Not only did the food arrive in half the time predicted by the app, it arrived piping hot (and we all know that lukewarm food is the bane of delivery).The chicken korma was the standout, but everything was really good. Would definitely order again.<//Text><user>108422088606922689216< /user><user_name>Elisa Alexander<//user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rating>

Always love the food here abs the atmosphere is great.
Usually fantastic service, but tonight we had a little less than a stellar response when asking for something special. We understand when you're answer has to be no, but we thought our waiter could never been a little nicer about it

We really miss the 3 and 4 course meals where you had 3 and 4 choices for each course at a fixed price.

Love the mac and cheese.<//Review>

<Review>Neat location with a retro interior decor. I was surprised to see so many menu options, which was nice. I would say it’s an upscale dining experience, but without the stuffy frills of feeling like you need to get dressed up— I think the majority of patrons were in jeans. No host to greet me, but I was meeting friends so after waiting a bit just poked around and found them, no problem.
My friends loved their food, but sadly my steak was over cooked. Not completely inedible, so no complaints from me, just not 5-worthy in my opinion.</Review>< Pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><text>I have been to Jack & Charlie's about a dozen times. Yesterday's lunch (2/3/20) was the first substandard meal/service that we've had. The entrees were still delicious, but we had to track down the waiter (we had never seen him working there previously) because he never checked if our meal was ok (condiments were needed for the burgers). Then we ordered the banana cake for dessert. It was delicious as long as we didn't eat the bottom, which was burnt. We showed the very black, nasty tasting crust to our waiter who basically told us oh well too bad and handed us the bill. Waiters at most reputable restaurants would have taken it off of our bill. He did not offer this so we took it out of his tip instead. I'm sure we will be back again, but hopefully the experience well be back to the usual excellence.<//text>< UserId.>

This is one of my favorite places to eat in town when I want a more expensive night out. It can be pricey but it is worth it. I have loved all of their appetizers. My favorite is the mac and cheese. It is delicious.I really like their basil strawberry mixed drink. It is sweet, light, and refreshing.< /review>

Jack & Charlie's is in the basement of Visalia old jail house. It's quaint like something out of the roaring 20's except in today's standards. There's a red rose or red carnation on each table and you are seated at a table with white table cloth with nice silverware place settings and cloth napkins. It's very classy and brings you back to an era that has been long gone.
Service is very good and the food is good. They do have a bar area that makes fantastic drinks.< /text>

< Review>
Our waitress was very friendly, but obviously had several tables to take care of. She was constantly rushing from table to table and seemed a little flustered. We did notice a table or two that had been seated after we got their food and drinks before we did. Could have been because we'd ordered specialty drinks, but did make us question why our section was so much busier than theirs.< /Review>

Went here for my 10 year anniversary. It was my first time here recommended by friends. Great service and great tasting drinks. The food was rather expensive for what you get. It tasted good, but wife and I were expecting bigger portions ...  $100 later and we decided to end the night at our local favorite spot called FUGAZZIS.</Text>

I had never been to Jack and Charlie's before. It's not a really well known place since its location is just off the beaten path. But it was very high end and charming. The drinks were delectable and the appetizers were unique and tastey. Very cozy vibe, all of the employees greeted us and asked how our night was going. The bar tender was unpretentious, welcoming, and down-to-earth. However everything is expensive so be prepared to spend.< /Text>

This should be a 5-star review.  Sadly, it isn't.  I will say, however, that the last two times I visited here was for lunch and they were severely short-staffed, apparently.  As a result, service was what a marketing professional might refer to as "leisurely".  Food was very good, though -- surprisingly good for this area -- "still-thinking-about-it-days-later" good.</Text>

Great food! Great ambiance. It's neat since it used to be an old jail in Visalia. Fun historical touch. Had business dinner, baby shower celebration and just a date night. Almost never is it over crowded. But on a night with time constraints I'd make reservations just in case. If it's busy it's about 60-90 minutes kind of busy.<//text>

<text>Update:

Greg, the owner, called me immediately after my review and invited me back for another chance to experience his restaurant.

Tonight: 9/23/19, we returned on a Monday night. Our server was Jeremy. He was polite, courteous, funny, and made our experience at the restaurant exquisite. He was timely with our drink orders, and made it a point to ask us if we wanted water, down to bottles or tap, and what kind of bottled. We didn’t expect that at all, but that was really nice. Afterwards, we had their Mac N Cheese again, and everything was delivered on point. My wife and I both had their Filet Minon. I had their four-course meal, all of my servings was outstanding, as well as my wife’s.

We had the pleasure of meeting Greg, and it was an absolute pleasure. We will be back in the future, we really appreciated Greg and his restaurant.

Original Post: My wife and I came here 8/9/19, excited as we had tried Vintage Press and The Depot, both were terrific. We arrived around 7:15 PM, and were seated in the bar area because it was pretty busy. It took at least 10 minutes to get drinks ordered. Then after we had our drinks for another 10-15 minutes, our waitress came and took our order, she had intended just for us to order an appetizer, however we wanted to our food ordered since we could see things were taking a bit longer. After we waited for another 20 minutes, our appetizer, MAC and cheese was delivered, which was delicious. After we had finished, we waited another 30 minutes for our dinner to finally arrive. We were offered another round of drinks after our appetizer was finished, which we agreed, however those didn’t show up until after our dinner had been served. That was another extended length of time.

We understand a popular restaurant being busy, however the main reason for the 1 star rating was that my wagyu beef had terrible texture, firm on the outside but very rare on the inside. Also, there were pieces of fat bordering the edge of the cut. I found it pretty disappointing I couldn’t fully finish this $65 plate. Also, my wife’s chicken had blood in it. We had to google to see if it was even safe to eat. She ate very little in fear of food poisoning.

We also found it incredibly rude that our waitress had time to talk to people she knew personally, talking about texting them and going on about their personal lives, as our service had been pretty poor, along with our food.

I asked for the check and feared waiting any longer. Before tip it was $145. For the price of our drinks and meal, we were extremely disappointed.

We enjoyed the atmosphere and the appetizer, however I don’t think we’ll be back for a return visit.</text>< Pictures>

<review>I can't believe there are no reviews for Jack and Charlie's!!! This is one of our favorite restaurants in Visalia. Classic, but basic, art nouveau design. If you are looking for true exciting, creative, market-fresh bistro-syle food, this is your place. Think Wolfgang Puck in the early days. I could go on and on about favorite dishes we have had there--unique appetizers that you won't find anywhere (I don't care where you go), foie gras, great fish dishes (depending on what is fresh), beef stroganoff made with steak and fresh noodles, steaks, fabulous bread pudding. Specially selected wines, unique bar drinks and a specialty in absinthes. Great bar scene. I hesitate to tell you how good this place really is as I selfishly don't want everyone to go.... The only disappointment about this restaurant is the menu sometimes changes---as it must---but the excitement of trying new dishes typically makes up for it.<//review><Date>1559037978370<//Date><user>115360496187310813108</user><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

Excellent staff. Food is well above par..I'd say an eagle. I think the lamb shoulder was half a lamb. Swordfish cooked perfect. I would recommend J&C's to anyone who loves fine dinning.<//Review>

<review>This was our first visit to Jack and Charlies and it was good, and bad.  The food was excellent, presentation was beautiful and the atmosphere was nice.  The night we were there, they were slow, with only 3 tables occupied.  After bringing our salads, they decided to send our server home.  The service had been good until then.  We heard from our server (before the service stopped) that they were owned by the Vintage Press.  We told her that we had given up on going to the VP because the service was so bad.  She said that she had heard that before, and ironically that's when our service stopped too.  It was a full 30 minutes from the time we finished our dinner until our table was cleared.  We ordered desert, which arrived 20 minutes later, and ordered another glass of wine, which never came.  Give it a 3 star, which is average between excellent in presentation and flavor, and terrible for service.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Be aware there is a new cook and the food is not as good! Also we saw a huge rat scurry into the seat of the booth next to us...we notified the staff and they continued to seat people in the booths! It's usually really good here so it might just be an off night....but server didn't know about menu, new cook and huge rat!</Review>

My fiance and I came here for dinner and it was the best experience and great tasting food I've had in a while. A small example of the service: they led us to our booth with menus and let us look over it.....we noticed the glasses on the table had water spots on them...the server came back and noticed as well. I said "it was ok" (it's not a big deal I know that happens sometimes when they run them thru the dishwasher) and in response he said "no, it's not ok, I'll replace these for you right away".....even tho that was just a small gesture it showed great customer service and quality of this restaurant. Would definitely recommend and look forward to going again.<//Text>

<text>My party of 10 and I where treated with a sense of urgency. Our server (kanille) was very polite, well articulated, and very well organized. I really enjoyed my meal and service. Drinks where extraordinary. I am officially making it my favorite restaurant in Visalia.
Thanks everyone!</text></record>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This gem sports a new menu every day and is one of the few places where I overeat. It's the favorite of my wife and I. Every dish is unique. Every dish is beautiful. And all are mouthwatering and delicious. We've never been disappointed. Lunch or dinner, doesn't matter. Some folks may think it costly but they are wrong because food and fun like this is worth dropping a few extra ducketts for. Weeds out the parade of human debris you find at all the chains. Thanks Jack and Charlie...don't ever change.

Update: it changed. Our last experience was really bad. We had to ask for menus twice, the food was mediocre and poorly presented, the young man who brought our first dish didn't bring silverware, and when he did he placed them right on the bar surface instead of on a napkin. It seemed they could do nothing right. Adios.<//Text>< pics>

This little spot is great.   I absolutely hate having to work in Hanford, CA so I usually drive out 20 minutes or so to Visalia to stay.   This is one of my go to spots in the cool little down town area.  The food is great, however, I do order the same thing every time.   Beef, Filet Mignon (California) Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Shaved Zucchini, Cognac, Green Peppercorns 39... its fantastic and they give you bone marrow butter on the side.   Cant go wrong and some great local beer choices as well. No 805, but no point deducted.  Look for the red phone booth and head downstairs for a real treat.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A little discovery that Jack & Charlies, improbable localization, a mixture of French fashionable French cuisine, finally real cutlery with a real towel, slightly adapted menus every day (rather good sign), excellent bread, butter type US unfortunately that spoils the party a little, excellent fish (slightly spicy), beef strogonoff, pork ribs, muscular tariffs however, excellent service (thank you Matthew)

The Waiter was fast and cared about checking for our allegers! The food was amazing and service was fast! The out door seating had a giant fire pit, which also made the glasses reflect it! From the starter to the desert everything was amazing!<//text>

Love the food I ordered. Took only about 30 minutes to serve. Service was great. Got a free chocolate cake for my mom who celebrated her birthday. Bonus: the waitress sang really well. 😁< /text>

The food was great, had the Cowboy Burger. Ingredients we're fresh and we'll prepared. The green bean coleslaw was very good too. The service was also excellent. The Tanaya is a great place for families with small children. I've never seen a better place for that. Last night the indoor pool was filled with kids splashing and watching a Pixar type movie on the big wall of the giant pool area. They have more activities than I can list here including archery. Great place.<//Review>

Food was okay, but compared to the grill this was a huge disappointment. For the prices you are paying this should be fine dining and it simply isn't. If you want good food and good service eat at the jackalopes bar and grill.< /Review><user_name>Neill Turner< /user_name></record>

<Review>The food quality was much better than expected: from the vegetarian feta / spinach sandwich to the eggplant/zucchini one or the chicken wings, everything was spot on what you expect from a nice restaurant in a good size city vs hotel food. The one point that was not up to standard was how slow the food service was with over 30 min of wait. But at least our waiter was kind enough to give us a heads up half way. I just wish that during the 20 min waiting to get seated, we could have ordered to fix this issue.< /Review>< date>

Not to be confused with Jackalope's Bar and Grill which is currently using their space while renovating that's serving expensive unseasoned tasteless sub-par lunch and dinner.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Our short ribs had to be cut with a steak knife and the gravy tasted like the packet variety from our college days. I noticed the couple next to us sent their entree back. We didnt because our server was pleasant and efficient. Lower your prices or raise your quality. 👎👎< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>The Salmon and cous cous were really good. Since we did not have a reservation we sat in the patio, which was well heated on a cold rainy day. We enjoyed the entrees we ordered and desserts we great. Good place for dinner if you are staying at Tenaya lodge or on you way to Yosemite.</Review>< rate>

The staff is friendly but the food options are limited and not that flavorful.  I ordered room service and the hotel staff member that took my order did not know the menu options I sleceted were on the menu. So instead of referring to the menu, she told me they didn't have that item that I just ordered the previous night. To be one of four restaurants for families within a 15-20 mile radius of others I think they could do better.< /text>< user>

Before,  it was a good meal "for Yosemite."  now it is a  fine meal at a regional level (sf / Napa / Bay area) .  Highly recommended.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

The food, an onion soup and  lentil soup were barely edible.  The crab tostada
Had almost no crab in it.  Prices are high and food pretty bad.   A plus was the service which was excellent.  In such a lovely hotel as Tenaya, a shame the food is terrible.<//text>

First off this is not the bar and grill with the good breakfast everyome is talkimg about.   This is the dinner resturant.

The food was poor at best.  Overpriced and brought out cold.  The steak was a poor cut (and cold)  the shrip was also cold and obviously re-heated.  The griller artichoke hearts were jared artichokes, served cooled (ungrilled) causing the to be worse than the costo jared marrinated artichoke hearts.

The service was decent, but not exceptional.

Overall, i do not recommed this resturant.<//Text>

Food is delicious for certain dishes but as usual, the food is over-priced and it is served very slowly.

Party of 12, 8:30 pm reservation, my entree is finally on my table at 10:05pm.< /text>

We had a 'deluxe double' bedroom which I thought was more roomy than it was. ...    It was one room, No fan in bathroom, but rooms were really warm in a good way.     Great beds,  great comforters.    Nice lounge chair and desk with two chairs.   Nice touch with the robes.
- PEOPLE WITH ANIMALS:  We  brought our dog and were only charged 75$ for 3 nights.   We were not charged 75$ per night per dog like the website said.      There is not a limit of 5 dogs per day total at the lodge, like the website says,   and I counted way more than 5.     All guests with dogs seemed to be housed in one row,  on the first floor,  rooms 177 to 191,  and the back yard area was grass with too much doggie doodoo that guests weren't picking up.     LOVED the doggie doodoo bags,   the dog bed,  dog toys and water bowl.    They were very welcoming to our dog and that was great!!
-VIEW:  The lodge is renovating the pool and the back side,  and our view was a green fence with dirt and tractors.    For the price,  I was very disappointed in the view out of our back sliding glass window and thought the lodge should have said something to us, or reduced the price.      There was no tractor construction while we were there, no noise,  but,  still the view was horrible.
-HAD TO WALK OUTSIDE LODGE TO GET TO ROOM -- I thought it was strange that we had to walk outside the lodge to get to our room...  You'd think that with a hotel in Yosemite,  you could walk inside or outside to get to the main lodge area/restaurants...
-NICE STAFF  --   great staff.
-VALET:    VALET IS free,  but warning,  we used it once, called 1/2 hour in advance and when we went out,  it wasn't there....    so we self parked and didnt use valet the rest of the day.
-FOOD:    the food was nothing to write home about.
-CHRISTMAS BUFFET:   really nice.     great staff,   very good food, but again,  pretty average.
-ACTIVITIES:   we went ice skating in Yosemite,   and did ROCK CLIMBING at the lodge,..    super fun.< /Text><Response>None<//Response><user_id>110580285885498219979< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is okay. I would only come here for certain things. The corn was really soggy. The torta’s tasted kinda funny. The fruit was good and also the liquados.< /Text>

<Text>I was acknowledged at first but needed a minute to look at their menu. Wasted my remaining mins of my 30 min lunch waiting for my order to be taken and went over the 30 waiting for it. They need more staff during lunch hour. 1 girl working the front and handeling food. You guys should put some music. Feels awkward in here.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Loved the food. I ordered two things. The mangoneada and a mazapan smoothie. The smoothie was ok. Tastes like a light hazelnut frappucino. The mangoneada was great. Has chunks of mango, tajin, and served with a tamaroca banderilla. Hit the spot on a hot day.<//review>

<review>Nice place to have good food. I gave a 4 star only because price a little high but big portions and the music was playing a bit loud. Overall a 4 1/2 star in my book. We ordered the carne asada quesadilla and beef/chicken enchilada plate.  My girlfriend and I were satisfied and happy with the portions and taste. Give them a try.< /review>< user_id>

I don’t like to complain or give mess up reviews but I drove 40 miles to get to this place and we left all the food and drinks on the table   this place is not only pricy , I don’t who hire the cook the food is disgusting, no flavor , we got the agua de fresa and there was no ice and definitely no strawberries in it .. I order the fruit salad and it tasted like pruno they also got stingy with the sugar
If I could give minus 5 stars I would..<//Text>

<text>Food is great. I ordered some buffalo fries, mangoneada, and large Jamaica. Great taste in everything, and great prices.

Biggest upset was the wait time. Got to the drive-thru and it took them about 5 minutes for them to say something. Then they finally said something and they put me on hold for another 8 minutes. Then I finally ordered and it took another 25 minutes to get my food. That’s why I only give this place 3 stars.

I get that these things take time to cook, but that’s was ridiculous.</text>< user_id>

The chama go was good but salty and the nachos were the worst nachos I’ve ever had. They were supposed to have guacamole, pico de Gallo, cheese, and beef. But they had a tiny amount of burnt meat that tasted old and super oily old, stale chips. They tasted old in general and had no guacamole or pico. Just burnt green peppers and onions with the oily, old nacho chips,cheese, and a bit of cheese. They tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I am not going back again.< /Text>< rating>

<text>Don’t worry about politics from inferior people. I’ve read some of the negative comments. Those people are not doing well in their business and want to pick on the small businesses. Whom only want to boost their other businesses.

This establishment has the best Mexican style food. Totally worth it. Order via Ubereats delivery.</text><Date>1605073254638< /Date><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

Finally decided to stop by. The breakfast burrito is huge. Great flavor! The salsas taste great. And walked out with a fruit cup! Yummy...reminds me of the old skool eloteros and fruit stands in LA.</Review>

<review>Visited
September 11. Ordered using drive through window.  When I got to window, cashier leans out window...no mask. Looking past her to food preparers, no one wearing either masks or gloves. I paid for the food, but I asked her “no masks?” She said “we have them”. Very rude. I left the food there. Not worth the risk. Went to Taco Bell.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Had a chance to stop by and try the fruit cups. Well some of the fruit was not fresh and it could be seen. I also informed the cashier that i had recently been recovering from food poisoning and could not eat spicy products like those that go on the fruit cups. I then asked for a sweet substitute in place that was easily available. To be told that it would be extra.......altogether it was not a memorable or enjoyable experience inside the store< /text>

The concept of the place is cool. The various tropical fruit cups are great! I sometimes come here just for those! Their chicken burrito is pretty good though a bit greasy. The carne isn't very good, so I suggest trying their other options if you are considering that.< /text>

<Review>We happened upon this place by accident and I'm glad we did. The food was excellent, above average typical taco shop menu. Then there's these crazy fruit concoctions they make that put this place over the top. You know a place is good when primarily Hispanic customers flood in during the 30 or so min we we're there. Definitely going back, my favorite new Mexican food place.< /Review><user>104829446397867120815< /user>< resp>

This was my first time here. We saw it on line and wanted to try it. So I went today and ordered a surf and turf burrito,the flavor was really good I ordered it with potatoes instead of rice which in my opinion that's the way it should be. The customer service was ok but could be better, only one person in thd front might not be enough. But what bothered me was that when I ordered and my food was ready the cashier called my number as well as several other Hispanic customers but when an American customer walked in he was treated way different and his food was delivered to his table, I thought it was odd but maybe that's how it is. I will go back because the food is good the place is nice and clean. Nothing against any one. I work in customer service and of course I noticed.</text>

One of the owners had carried on and on how, much more healthy their food was going to be.
But this was not an example of healthy in any shape or form.
Try about two quarts less  grease/oil to get a little tiny bit closer to healthy...</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I went to this place and had a bad experience!
The food was a joke, meaning the "dollar taco" is nasty and bearly any ingredients in the taco! So I order something else and of course the employees were rude. I did not eat what I order I just left the place, everything is overpriced! I would never go back.< /review>

Food was good, fruit blended drink was wonderful, but the service behind the counter could use work. Weren't working like a team, communication problems, I think. 2 drive through customers came back with order errors, too. I will be back though because I want to try so many other things. Photos make me curious but not sure what many menu items are!<//text>

< Review>
let me start off by saying I loved the food! But I gave it a three star out of five because I am a local and always buy here but 90% of the time they short me a dollar to three dollars of my change and I am trying to think it’s not intentional but it just seems like it because of how often it happens to me and my family .< /Review>

The chamango and chamfresa drinks are amazing!! They are a little expensive but definitely worth it. We like the dollar tacos they have on Tues and weds as well the only issue I have with this place is the drive thru takes foreverrrrrr. Even if you are the only person in the drive thru you will be there ten to fifteen minutes minimum. Other than that this place is pretty good.< /text>

Best California Burrito in the area. Hands down. Prices are reasonable. Not only an amazing authentic restaurant, they have fruit specialties no other places have. High emphasis on customer satisfaction; they have an anonymous suggestions box!</Text>

<Review>Very unusual and very nice Mexican food. I ordered veggie bowl #2. I asked the lady to replace black beans with jicama and onions. They have good choices of salsas available. I used habanero salsa and green salsa in my bowl and it was delicious. It was around 7:30 pm. Everything was still tasted fresh. It was a good experience to eat there.</Review>< pics>

Very good food and general experience. I am Mexican and it very much reminds me of home. Not 5 stars because the dining in area is not very good. Its dark and the TVs don't work right.<//Review>

Be careful when you go to this restaurant. On many occasions they have given me the wrong order. After telling them and repeating my order they still get it wrong. The worst part is that I have to return to the place.  Then they have an attitude about their mistake and don’t care about the inconvenience they cause you. Stay away if possible.< /Review>

<UserId.>105735755791784022304<//UserId.><review>The place is small and clean. Was a recommendation that works in the area. The food was very greasy (I asked for the milanesa plate and the meat was deep fried) my wife asked for a mango/coconut cocktail and the coconut was horrible and old. Also music was loud and combined with the chat of the customers, the blender noises from the kitchen and the sounds of the street made my dinner experience something that I don't want to repeat. Next time we are going to a Taco Bell (my wife suggested that)<//review>< date>

<review>I am giving this place a star because I cannot give them less.
How is it that this place is still open with the uncleaninless of the place, the terriblly low quality, pricey, horrible food?
I don't understand.
I ordered a fruit salad to go, and when I was eating it, I noticed that the fruit was moldy.
I had purchased food before and I thought that maybe it was just an "off" day.
We'll, I think every day is an "off" day for them.
Eat there at your own risk.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

We stopped by here on a whim, it was on our way to a family outing on a Saturday morning.  Breakfast burritos - was not disappointed. Eggs were cooked PERFECT.. I cannot stand a single bit of runny eggs OR overcooked eggs.  The cheese was nicely melted... now my mouth is watering just thinking about those burritos... BRB< /text>

Great little tacos on Taco Tuesday! Only $1 each. Good, homemade-tasting horchata. The salsas all will clear your sinuses. But they gave great flavors!
Clean, reasonably fast. First time there; next time will be some different items, including some fruit dishes. They looked delish!</text>

< Review>
I see what people mean about the service.. I always get the adobada fries because they're the best I've had anywhere. The main reason I never order anything else is because EVERY SINGLE TIME I have a question about something on the menu, they have NO idea what I'm talking about. All I'm asking is "what's in the --(blank)----?" But I have to repeat this over and over in different ways. It's okay to have language barriers, ...im not expecting them to do small talk st the register or anything, but they should at least be trained to just say basic ingredients in English.< /Review>

This is the second time I ordered carne asada fries.... the fries is old
I think they warm it and put the meat over it
It looks really bad and the taste is awful
First complaint they said they changed the Sheff , I really don't know what's there excuses now .</text>

Drive thru took too long and way too many choices. Gordon Ramsey says if you want the food to be great you should not offer such an extensive menu, but with that being said food is just okay.<//Review>

Better fruit drinks than food. I got the bacon ham quesadilla- the ham was not chopped up like the bacon, it was a whole slice like it was put there at the end. I got a bfast burrito, the tortilla wrapped around way too many times (which means there was no meat inside). The fruit drinks are good.< /text>

We were bummed when El Coxitan was first replaced by Chamoy but were pleasantly surprised when we first tried this place! It is now our go to Mexican joint in Poway! Has quality ingredients you can taste over the competition. Highly recommend the adobada!</Text>

<Text>A taco shop that has a more limited mexican food selection, but also has many fruit options. The pricing is pretty fair, it was quick to get my food, but there was an error but it's not the biggest deal. As for my taco combo, I opted for the potato tacos, which turned out to just be ok. The beans and rice are fine too.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<review>I paid $19 for a small Chamango, and the red beef enchilada plate, my enchiladas were missing the avocado it clearly said on the drive-thru menu they come with, no rice and beans....again as it says on the drive-thru menu they come with.

Fresh salsa and plates to go. Love cooking for Street tacos special on Tuesday Wednesday. Carne as is real and not steak cut up fine to look like Carne.
Ask for both salsas and try a horchata< /text>

Literally sat at the drive thru to order for 10 minutes and no one came on the intercom. We had to back out of the drive thru because no one would take our order. We even pulled up the the window with no result. Eventually we walked in and still received no service....the employees just looked at us and walked right past us. After awkwardly standing there with no one else in line someone finally came out of the back to take our order. Also a quick note, bo one was waiting for their food, there was one family that was already eating. Also we know the drive thru wasn't occupying their time. It's a pass! Much better places around.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dbfa3668aa7ed3:0x5fb6e3552d56c0e2< /gmapID></record>

My carne asada fries was humongous. I couldn't finish it and I eat a lot. Looks like they have lots of interesting food and desserts. Will definitely come back.< /text>

I’m here waiting in the DRIVE THRU for 20 mins for 3 tacos. 3. They charge $3.95 for a taco that is no bigger than a fifth grades hand. They’re food though is really good I’ll give them that much;however, the wait and price is absolutely ridiculous.</review>

Its a big enough bowl for my husband and I to feel full. They give you other things on the side to add into your caldo. We've also had the carne asada fries which are ok and the quesadillas. Their coffee drink and smoothies really hit the spot. They are a Little more pricey here but worth the money.< /Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

The have a large menu which is nice. But the prices are high and it is not easy to tell what you are getting with each item.

My son got Fruiti-locos and it came with pig skin on it (like a raw or pickled rubbery fat).  It took up like 40% of the tray.

I got a chamango smoothie and the fresh mango chunks in the drink were the least ripe mango I have ever eaten.  For the price it was pretty dissapointing.< /Text>

Huge portions, very good and affordable. You really can’t find places like this much anymore. From their California burritos to their Hot Cheeto California burrito to their polo asada fries down to their mango con crema cups. This place is a must try and a staple for my family!</Review>

This is my second time here and the food is great. Their guacamole salsa is excellent. Love the a agua fresca, sandia....just ask for a little less sugar. The fruit salad is amazing...they cut the fruit in front of you. And the decor and music is great. Will definitely be back with friends.</Text>

Food quality is ok ,,customer service is very bad ,prices are inconsistent depending on cashier..my taco Tuesday experience seems like they put less food than other days, needs better management,I've been here 4 times I think its time to move on ,, by the way pepe's tacos in Ramona are way better or even Santanas in Scripps..<//review>

<Review>This is not just a taco shop it also offers a fresh variety of fruits. It offers unique items. I will say I have tried their adobada tacos and they are good and large. There fruit bionico is delicious and reminds me of the ones from Mexico. They definitely have Mexican music playing and there is plenty of seating. Just asked for their hours and they are open from 7am-Midnight. If you are looking for chamongo, elotes, hot Cheeto burrito and other unique items this is your place to come. I think they can customize your order if you ask. There is an added bonus that they have a drive thru.</Review><Response>None</Response><rating>5</rating>< gmapID>

I got the Hawaiian Torta, (carne asada, adobada, ham, and pineapple).  It was a pile of tasty served up with a side of fries.  Would have been enough to split with someone else, but seeing as I'm a fat kid, I polished it off on my own.  I also ordered a Sandia, and was surprised to watch them make it fresh.  They threw watermelon, sugar, and water in a blender, I'm assuming said some magic words, and poured out a giant cup of happy.  I've come back multiple times just for the fresh aguas.</Review>

UPDATE : This is an authentic Mexican restaurant. I noticed in a Google search of Mexican restaurants in the area that this did not show up. Hopefully mentioning this now will help.

My kids and I were very sad to see the old Cotixan go. Although their food wasn't necessarily amazing or consistent, their carne / carnitas / Cali burritos and chimis were our go-to comfort food for years.

LUCKILY, Chamoy Taqueria + Fruteria just opened up to replace the old taco shop, and Poway is all the better for it! Our first visit was tonight just to check things out, although it's been open since late November. The decor has been completely redone and has a more colorful and friendly vibe with big food posters and banda music playing. You'll immediately notice boxes and fridge displays of fresh fruit near the front containing all sorts of tropical - ish varieties... Especially mangoes. Lots and LOTS of mangoes. All of this highlights this restaurant's emphasis on fresh fruit menu items... And there's a LOT on the menu. (See the menu pics)

The food... All kinds of fresh fruit items plus your standard So Cal taco shop menu offerings, along with some unique and trendy items like the quesaburrito and churros locos. I did order the quesaburrito because their description of having 'crunchy cheese' inside caught my attention. It had absolutely no crunch whatsoever, but it was a pretty darn good version of a carne asada burrito. It had a nice flavor and lots of fresh guac. They also didn't disappoint on the size, which was as big as most folks' forearms.

I also had a big mango agua fresca, which was outstanding. They were extremely generous with the fresh mangoes, and I could almost chew on my drink with every sip. Delicious! I can't wait to come back and try some different things in the very near future.< /Review>

First visit. Ordered breakfast burrito with ham potatoes and beans.   Potatoes needed to cook longer, they were still hard and they forgot to add beans even after asking the girl twice to make sure it was added.  Not a good first visit with so many other options in poway.< /review>
