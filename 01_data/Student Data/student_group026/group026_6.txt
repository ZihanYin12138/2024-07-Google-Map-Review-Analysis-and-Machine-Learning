Pro-Tint is local and decided to give them business because they know what they're doing. If you live in SoCal, tinted windows are a must. The nonstop heat we receive each year is ridiculous and if your car has leather seats, tinted windows will prolong the life of those seats from harmful UV rays. Unlike some other businesses are first come first serve, they accept appointments and will give you a reasonable time frame.

One caveat that I should mention is that when I took the two cars to get windows tinted during Covid and the employees here had their masks off or wearing them on their chins while installing tint on cars. When entering the business, the lady at the front desk (Jasmine) didn't wear hers either until someone (me) walked into the building. Even before vaccines were offered, I saw it on both occasions (dropping off and picking up) that masks were not worn properly, either not wearing it on wearing it on their chins. I assume they don't want to wear it or hinders them while working on the cars but I honestly believe the owner should make it a priority that his/her employees are safe and following protocols. All I can do is make note of everything since it's their decision not to do it.

If you  plan on getting your tint here, I do recommend sanitizing everything in your car just to be safe. Also, when I picked up my Subaru and Toyota, there was a small piece of a blue towel was was stuck by the front windshield and the windshield pillar. There was also trash that was left behind by the passenger door. I don't mind throwing it away but I wished they looked carefully that nothing was left. If they give you a pickup window time of 2-3 hours, it may be longer. I dropped off my car at 12:15 for a 12:30 appointment, was given a 3-3:30 pickup time. Jasmine called me at 5:00 asking if anyone called me to pick it up, which no one did. They she told me that it's ready for pickup. So there are small things that irked me, which is why I gave this place 3 stars. However, this business still did what they're known for and I'm thankful it turned out great. I just recommend some improvements internally.

To give you an idea of how much you might pay, when I first brought my Subaru Outback here May 2020, I got my front windshield tint (3M Crystalline) for $250. Couple months later, I had to remove it because Subaru of American needed me to remove it in order to fix an issue with my vehicle. I came back couple days ago to get the same exact tint installed on my front windshield, yet they charged me $329 (including tax). I have no idea why the price increased for the past 11 months for the same windshield. The rest of my windows for my Subaru was $733 (including tax) for 3M Color Stable. For the Prius Prime, It was $318 for all windows, using 3M Color Stable.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I needed to tint my daughter’s two front door windows and I was looking for a good deal on just regular tint. Nothing too crazy or expensive.  I called the usual spots in the general area and Gabby from Pro-Tint quoted me a competitive price of $70, which was cheaper than the other shops. She said she would  take me in that afternoon, which was perfect. The car and the tint was a surprise for my daughter’s birthday gift.  When I arrived, I was greeted by Jeff (GM) and I explained to him about the deal I was quoted and he was going to honor it, but he showed a tint for a little bit more but offered heat rejection. He wasn’t pushy, but he did make for a compelling argument and a deal I couldn’t pass up.  So I upgraded.  Didn’t take long and his staff was working on it in no time.

While I was waiting, I noticed he had an audio set-up such as Alpine and back-up camera systems.  Something I wanted to add to my 2006 Toy Tundra.  I discussed what I was looking for, such as upgrading my head unit and adding a rear camera unit.  He didn’t hesitate and was very knowledgeable.  I can tell that he knows his stuff.  He explained the different price points and needed accessories and also offered some price cutting tips if price was a factor.  As a point of reference, I went to Best Buy’s car audio section and they pointed out a few stuff and that was about it.  I didn’t feel valued and didn’t feel they really knew what I wanted or needed.  Jeff took the time and listened and I didn’t feel rushed at all.  Jeff was very personable.  I feel I can come in talk the shop and have confidence in they’re service whether it’s involves window tinting, PPF or car audio.  He’s earned a customer for life.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY-aKR60-zctI1-8YBrSrxL3IK6yiZYPy4l9Bw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Awesome job with knowledgeable staff.
We made appointment to have our windows tinted. Jeff , who is the owner called us back right away to acknowledge our concern about the possible scratches of the tint which is kind of common on BMW. He is very professional and  informative. We had great experience there. Our car looks beautiful.
Highly recommended.</review>

Over the years, I have been to Pro Tint several times.  They have installed multiple sound systems and just recently tinted the windows on my Lexus.  I’ve had excellent service every time and HIGHLY recommend them.  The owner, Jeff, is an extremely knowledgeable, fair, honest and friendly guy!  He will give you a fair price and quality work!   I recently purchased a brown Lexus and wanted a tint that would match the warm color of the car. Most of the tints I see have a black gray silver color to them but I wanted a brown gold color. Jasmine, who works in the front office, showed me a wonderful tint that would match my brown car. I will admit it was pricey, but after deciding to get it done, I have not regretted the decision for a day. On those hot days in LA, the tint keeps my car so cool and it really stands out from the common tints on the road.  Shout out to Jose who has installed multiple sound systems/upgrade speakers in different cars for me, he is the most knowledgeable in this area and the sound is amazing, crystal clear and loud, which is how I like it!  All in all I give Pro Tint 5 stars for their quality of work and they stand behind everything they do.   You will not be disappointed if you use them, make sure you ask for Jeff!< /Text>

<Text>I’ve been a customer of ProTint for many years now....That alone speaks volumes. One of my best friends always used their services for stereo and tint.
After using them I realized why.... Jeff the owner expects nothing but the highest quality work from his employees... From the time you get there until the time you leave you are treated with respect and professionalism.... Even though they are always busy, they have always had my vehicles ready when thy said they would, or earlier.... That is “HIGHLY” unusual in this industry. I will continue to take all my vehicles there!<//Text><date>1587054720365< /date>< pictures>

They even had an area that demonstrated the differences of tint so you could really get a grasp for the differences in tint offered. Jeff had also walked me through the different set ups for a Bluetooth stereo system and speakers for my car. Again he went above and beyond to help me get the set up I wanted for my truck. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat since I know for a fact the customer service offered here is definitely second to none.

<Review>After some searching and calling around to about 5 different shops with about a $5-$10 difference in quotes. I decided on going to this place because it was nearby a really bomb Ramen spot.

Jim helped me schedule my appointment so I came in at 3PM on Saturday. Unfortunately, we didn't get my car into the garage to get worked on till 4PM. Whoops. Guess they were pretty backed up that day. I spent about 3 and a half hours here. Jeff (the owner?) quality controlled my tint before letting me leave and had them redo a window, which I greatly appreciate. Got the 3M Color Stable at 20% all around and 5% in the back. Looks hella clean.

I did however notice some very tiny bubbles. I brought it back the next weekend and Jeff came in and pressed them out for me. He also assured me that if I wanted to, I could get them re-tinted. Again these bubbles were super tiny so I decided against it. (And he pressed out most of them anyway)

They have a lifetime warranty so long as you weren't the one to cause the damage, you could bring it back and have them re-tint the windows. All in all a great experience with this business.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ_UX-s--evpRfEfy8zjNDzZgQQJUxME2In1QC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaMJgDPviDrngCOqqbFSNkvRodFamdERwEvh_n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>{'time': 1500216432651, 'text': 'Thanks Marc,\nIt was a pleasure to be of service and we look forward to serving you again in the future.'}</response>< GmapID>

Every rating is good until there’s a problem. We brought in the car, picked the film, then they inspect it. Inspection is to check out any damages before they take it in, so no hassle later with customers. There are two scratches on the door frame after the job, then Jeff, the manager, told me that it could of been my fault, because clearly it’s a rock scratch. I only want my car to come back to me in the original state, but he came and told me how it could never been them, because I didn’t get the front windshield tinted, and the employees couldn’t have touched it, it’s not where they work. And it shouldn’t be the guys duty to inspect it, it should be the girl’s. Millions of excuses later, I said I wanted to be in the original state which I left it, and that’s it. And this is what he told me,“if you think it’s our fault then it’s our fault, then sure, we can get the paint for you and do it. But I know a rock scratch when I see one”. Great way to do business, blame it on the customer!
I don’t want the hassle of waiting for the paint (for a week) and it’s only used for Uber, then he ask me if I still want it. I said no, then he blames me again for making him go through all the trouble for finding the correct paint.
Later they called back, saying he could’ve handle the situation differently, it’s just that he had seen all kinds of scratches, and know what could made them. Well, I think the purpose of the inspection is probably something like this happened before, but to deny it even after inspecting it is just not acceptable. If after all these years of doing business and Jeff doesn’t know how to deal with a situation, then he should hire a professional.
Friendly sales though. Nice and on point.

Suggestion: record the inspection every time.

Warning to customers: RECORD the inspection!<//text>

Once, I realized that finding out the truth wasn’t important to you, I moved forward to solving the problem and offered to fix the rock chip to satisfy your concerns.

Quick and excellent!  I went there a little after 12pm and got it done around 2pm. The manager, Jeff, is very friendly, knowledgeable, and trustworthy.  The two front service ladies and the whole working teams are really nice. The price was great with 3M crystalline which is less than what I expected.  This is my third cars tinted there.  I definitely will recommend my friends to go to Protint.  By the way, Burger king fast food and a Chinese buffet are on the other side of the street.   You can stay two hours in either two restaurants while they are working on your car.  What a great service and location!!!</review>

< review>
I've been going here for at least 20 years for stereo and tint work. Tinting has never faded. Jeff always has some wizzard on board that can figure out any stereo or alarm issues that may arise. I've been to so many car stereo places over the last 42 years and it's usually a miss (seldom a hit). I moved out of state and just fired my last stereo guy in Cincinnati after he crossed speaker wires on my girlfriend's Landcruiser after she purchased speakers and he wanted to charge me to correct it blaming it on a different place that installed the stereo years ago... huh?. This I have found is fairly typical in this industry. A lot of them either don't know what they're doing, produce unclean installs or just don't care about return business for some reason. These have never been an issue with Pro-Tint. I still have them work on my cars when I go to California to work and occasionally purchase rust free cars to bring back to Ohio. Thanks Jeff!</review>

<text>I've recently had my car's windows tinted and here's my personal experience. The store: well managed by a professional team. The owner was there when I came in and he cared a lot about his business. This means customers can rely on accountability. The waiting room and the shop as well as the show room are nice and clean. The products: they carry good selection of quality stuff. This means customers would have many choices. The service: very professional and courteous.  I highly recommend this business.</text>< pictures>

I've done 3 tint jobs now on three different cars, and have been very happy with my 3M tint. It makes the car look much nicer than the cheaper low budget tints. The also do the 3M clear bra and carbon fiber film as accessories.  I haven't done a large scale car stereo install, but they did an excellent job on my Lexus factory speaker replacement with higher quality speakers.  I also like the atmosphere there, shop friendly with great customer involvement.

<Text>Brought my 2017 Chevy ZL1 convertible here for a 3M tint job.

Pros: super friendly, professional, courteous and honest. From the greeting on the telephone to the greeting upon arrival ( drop off and pick up ) every person I encountered  was extremely friendly. As for honesty, they sell genuine 3M tint, which has the 3M stamp on it, and they remove it for you in person so you know it's genuine. Their prices were better than three other local competitors.

Cons: none

I would definitely bring all future vehicles here and would recommend Pro Tint to a friend. A+ service!< /Text>< Resp>

<Review>Since the moment I walked in, I was quickly cared for by Jeff, a respectful, caring, and skillful entrepreneur. Before you meet Jeff, there’s a high possibility of meeting Jim, who is kind, supportive, and a father now! (Congrats)! The team will make you feel like family.
Through any situation, whether it be tinting windows with skin that doesn’t fade (for the same price as the ones that do)
On the other hand they work at a great pace
Considering the amount of work that is being done.
Brought my Subaru Impreza over, and am going to keep bringing it back, as a add more features to my car.
You won’t be disappointed, you’ll notice a sense of care for you and your car, while there.
I have been to shops all over LA and found this one about a year ago, and I’m going back there this week to maintain my LED lights.
unlike most shops, pro tints In Pasadena is positiveky different, which is what keeps me coming back.< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
One of the shadiest tinting and alarm places you'll ever encounter. They fluff a lot of their reviews with fake reviews or pay their friends and family to give them a good review. Look on Yelp for the real reviews. I had a tint here that started to fade and came back to get them to replace it. Since mine was a clear tint, they refused to re-do it. They said fading is only applicable to dark tint. Well I drove out there mad and had to deal with yellow windows. Go to California Tint down the street for better service and an honest person who gladly will help and not talk back to you.< /Review>

{'time': 1412876674672, 'text': 'Dear Mr Chung.  We are Sorry, you feel that way about our business.  Naturally, everyone is entitled to their opinion but your assertion that we "pay people to place fake reviews here on Google" is a first.  If you had a service done here, then you would know that our policy "offers warranty service on all products and services with proof of purchase".  Therefore, it does not make any sense at all that you would have been denied any warranty service as long as you provided the proof of purchase, especially since our manufacturer clearly states that "when a film fades it will be covered under their warranty, regardless of the color it becomes".  Now, I asked all staff members and no one seems to remember having a conversation with you. Thus, I don\'t understand the nature of this review.  Perhaps you have confused us with another store or perhaps you are friends with the owner of the establishment you were promoting in your review.  Either way,  If you would like to speak with me directly @ (626) 285-5208 to have this resolved, I will be more than happy to talk to you.  I look forward to your call.'}</resp>

< review>
I had a 2013 Avalon tinted about a week ago and i'm very happy with how it turned out.  My only complaint really is that they didn't clean up after themselves well.  The car had a lot of stains on the door, outside and inside, from whatever chemicals they used.  My wife was very unhappy as she was the one that ended up wiping it out.  Also, a 3M logo on the tint need to be wiped out at the very bottom of the back window.  I can understand it could be difficult, but it's something that needs to be done and I really didn't appreciate their disgusted attitude about removing it.  When he finally wiped it out, a significant size of wet paper towel got stuck.  He told me I have to live with it or take it out myself.  It was too late in the day to argue so I just left it at that.</review>

<Review>Took my car in to ProTint to get my headlights checked out and fixed after my lights kept going out. Finally was able to squeeze time in my day to go but they were already closing.. Jeff and Gabby were kind enough to take me in late and got to the very source of the problem right away. The price was great, there was no way i could refuse their services. I couldn't be happier! My HID's are bright and alive once again. Thanks again Guys, keep up the execellent work!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This place was recommended by some locals. Freshly made and great offers. LOVED both the shrimp/pork Dim sums and onion/garlic bread!
My only issue was language barrier which made it a task to order or ask about what they offered.< /review>

What a local gem of a take out spot. The food is cheap and fresh! Platters of dim sum, buns, and noodles come out and get swept up by the lines of people coming and going. Real OG Cantonese folks seem to come here and pick up their stuff for the night, etc. I wish I could have tried more but we were stuffed from the day. The egg tarts were HOT and FRESH. Highly recommend because Golden Gate was closed we didn't feel like we missed out on the egg tarts. The $1.50 bubble milk tea was pretty decent too. I left a happy gal.<//Review><gmapID>0x808580f35e4e9911:0x936a3b5886dddbc</gmapID>< user_name>

I don’t know why this place doesn’t have more reviews! This is a GEM. Dim sum was amazing, bbq bun was so fresh and chow mien was fantastic. We paid $11 for everything! 3 shrimp and chive, 3 shrimp dumplings, 1 bbq bun, 2 egg tarts and 1lb of chow mien. 10/10 for my husband and I.<//Review>

My only regret is not having enough stomach space to get literally everything in this whole bakery. I think takeout dimsum/Chinese bakeries are my favorite part of the food scene in San Francisco.

We came here actually because Golden Gate Bakery wasn't open yet/didn't have egg tarts that day and I'm not sad about it at all! My friend and I got shrimp and chive dumplings, potstickers, custard buns, egg tarts, sachima, and a zhongzhi all for about $11! The dumplings weren't warm (but still really good and homey), but the egg tarts were FRESH out of the oven, literally steaming, the crusts were so flaky and buttery and the custard was melt-in-your-mouth heavenly. What's Golden Gate?! The sachima - which I've never had a fresh one before - was a bit too oily but I also baseline am just obsessed with sachima so I was still loving it.

Also - they take card WHOOHOO<//Review>

<Text>We wanted to find something quick and easy for our lunch and didn’t want to spend too much time sitting inside a restaurant, as we planned to take in more of the sights of Chinatown San Francisco afterwards. While the queues outside the ever popular Golden Gate Bakery were ridiculous, we were able to find what we wanted around the corner at Wong Lee Bakery. The variety of dumplings, buns and egg tarts are freshly made in their tight kitchen area and the service was fast, although it took a few goes to communicate our order correctly. There’s no sitting room inside the store, but we were able to find a nice quiet spot nearby to enjoy our food.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
This place always has fresh and good-sized dim sums with the line moving quickly.  They have all the regulars such as shrimp dumpling, sui Chinese  tamale, but their unexpected winners are their desserts - their mochis (glutinous rice balls with red bean paste or peanuts) are out of this world and are only $1.80 for three, and their egg tarts and sesame ball are good, too.  The best thing is that their desserts and dim sums are probably the cheapest around Chinatown. If you like a hot Hong Kong style milk tea- theirs is pretty good too!< /Review>

Great, great and great again.
Had chicken dim sum (3), veggie egg roll (1) and coconut bun (1) - all was so good, especially the bun.
Place is small and the line was long but moving fast.
Moreover, all that for only $4 (amazing).< /review>

Why is no one talking about their Ma Lai cake? I haven’t seen this at dim sum in years, and theirs was so fluffy and just the right amount of sweet. So delicious! And the egg tart was solid, with a flaky, well cooked crust. The custard filling was slightly less sweet than other places, but still had the silky texture. Can’t wait to come back to try other dim sum items, and definitely will have the ma lai cake again!</review>

Was drawn to this bakery by the queue snaking out the door and boy, am I glad i did.

Got the sesame balls with red bean filling (3x for $1.80) - light, airy with a good dough to filling ratio, the sesame seeds also added a nice fragrance and the fresh prawn rice rolls (~$1.90) - would have loved to see more prawns but at this price I cannot complain, best eaten drowned in the accompanying soya sauce.

Prices are real wallet friendly, makes a great meal but the lack of space in the shop means that it’s to-go only, unless you’re lucky enough to snag the only table in the shop.</text>

The food was alright. However, like many others have said, the customer service was poor. First, the lady verbally expressed being irritated by us choosing a variety of buns. Then, she snapped at my mother to get out of the way of the line—but she was in the line ordering? After that, the lady quickly called up the next customer to basically push us out. Insanity.<//review>

Extremely dirty. My 1st and last time buying dim sum here. I completely don’t agree with the above reviews in this page. Customer service was so poor. The cashier disliked me for buying a lot of buns. Shouldn’t they be happy that they are making more money?? Charge for everything including bags to get a dozen of buns. The cashier is very sneaky about the transaction. Tips: You mush ask for your receipt.<//review>

It's very affordable, but they have been increasing the price a little. Some items are bad, some are good. You have to know what to get. The porridge and potstickers are good. Everything else is just average.<//Text>

This is my go-to place for dim sum. It may not look like much on the outside but don't be deceived. The dim sum is fantastic. Not a huge selection but what they have is great.</Text>

Chow mein and Chow fun are decent and these two items are vegetarian.  On another visit discovered they do not accept discolored or stained monetary bills.  It was stained from fruit juice.<//review>

The restaurant owner is pretty canny. A women with a kid ordered five pork buns for one dollar. When the kid got the bun, the bun was cold and hard. The lady then asked if he could steamed it. He saw the kid and said NO. Canny man, heartless....<//Text>

Had dim sum shrimp dumpling and pork siu mai here along with vegetable egg rolls. Pieces were huge and great value for price. Lots of variety to choose from and very tasty. Great place for a good quick snack or make a meal of it.</Review>

<text>Get these white flat round mochi pastries next to the cash register along with the sesame rolls that looks like old school rolls of film. The mochi pastries has 2 flavors, custard and red bean. Both will surprise you on how good they are. Also try the egg tart and avoid the wait at Golden Gate.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Like most places in Chinatown, people don't speak fluent English, but all you have to do is point and say how many.  Also many of the signs are in Chinese, so you can point and ask how much.  It's ok, I do it all the time and they're more than happy to help out.  So now you know how I order here, I point, say one order this, point one order that.  Just make sure they know what you're pointing at.

This place is a cheap take out dim sum place.  I always get the fried stuff here, there's a savory dish I like that is cooked pork in a mochi wrapper that is deep fried, both sweet and savory.  I think it's 3 for $1.60,  they package it in a plastic bag (most places do this), which actually makes it less messy to eat because you can just use the bag to grasp it.  The best deal is the milk tea with bobba.  They have milk or coffee flavor for $.99, while other places are $1.99 and up.  They make theirs stronger, but it's pretty sweet.

I go here and get a couple of things and can get filled up on 5 bucks.< /Review><response>None<//response>< user>

Wong lee Bakery is my favorite dimsum place/chinese bakery.

Their dimsum is better than the dim sum in all those dim sum restaurants down the street, yet wayyyyy cheaper!

Some of my favorite buns are the shredded pork bun, roasted pork bun, and eggtart. And my favorite dim sums are pot stickers and rice noodles.

All the buns/dim sum are super cheap... And if you want some bubble tea, they have it for 1 dollar. Plus, they have the best frozen dumplings!<//Text>

Enjoyed a nice family outing during spring break. Kids loved the vintage arcade and pinball games after the 18 holes. Bring your quarters for games.<//text>

There is so some old time arcade and pinball games. If you are in lake Tahoe and looking for some fun with the kids. This place is good to go! Oh and the beach is across the street too.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTLMN-I3Bmbua3IkTPXGRejtfhJBzv8XCqGXQe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv4N3gyVLgStrRUFTL8-FMtcvW_2P7C5flGjUG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1SDHs2tewgqlW5vE2jC7vrRF17kRk_0B3K9uJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDigiriSirLfCWz29jd11Om71f6p4RNXXgQOms=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKhHueZ8rB_f41B8aXAN3nuqysgonfPAk9Fj9k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJBeqnXC5tPWwt2-VIO9RKqzxPIlORnD4TfTUE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV12bIagzR1XTPLzDn0cwNbRizZ6bY4szbDLf2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0cojM9y6CgxfZP7fYft3GyXT0eaEUk2CI7AW5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPu8LYaPm9NfeqpfTyIn2WIgFF13uWGWR6W_e1P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvhZoq2ubvxUQ0DJMC_j5pGwzUtvgFE46z_qJS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
We brought my special needs nephew to the mini golf course and Omar let him play with a golf ball the whole time. It was not too crowded so allowing him to use the ball to play instead of golf was super nice and made all the difference for all the other kids. It is always hard to find people who understand families. This place made it enjoyable for the whole family. Omar is awesome. We will be retuning thanks to him!</Review>

We try and come to Magic Carpet Miniature Golf each time we are in the North Tahoe area. It is clean and well laid out. I was disappointed, however, that during Covid-19 masks were "optional" inside where the video games are located. Even employees weren't wearing masks. I really expected better and more concern for both the customers and employees.<//Text>

Really cute place, great for a family game. COVID friendly with hand sanitizer and clean bathrooms. There's three courses to choose from. We did the 28-hole course on one day and on our last day before our drive home we did one of the 18-hole ones. Wish we had gone earlier in the week so we could have also fit the third one in. The staff was also really helpful and friendly here too. All the kiddos loved it - five, six, and eight.<//review>

A fun but pricey mini golf course. The holes are dated but still challenging. There is an arcade with a few classic pinball and video games.< /text>

3 different courses. Grizzly Falls and Dinosaur are a little easier of the three - lots of kitchy fun on short holes. The subtle hills make the courses a little harder than you would think from a small course. Arcade is small but they have great games and even some pinball.<//review>

We had a great time, they have 3 minigolf courses there plus some arcade games inside. The facility was clean and well designed. We did the Grizzly River course which was 18 holes, it went pretty fast and was a great afternoon with the family.  Each hole had unique challenges, no repeats so that was great too.< /Review>

We always have fun at this place. There are a few holes where the balls got stuck in one of the features or where the best tunnel didn't quite line up with the hole so you couldn't get a hole in one, but overall it is well designed and a great place to take the family.< /review>

<text>I have been going here since I was very little. I have always loved it because of the fun courses and the great arcade. Magic Carpet Golf is my favorite mini golf course, and I am now in walking distance from our new move. I will be coming much more often in the summer, and I hope many will as well. The owner is also very kind and loves children, and I will be coming here for the rest of my life, and hopefully bring my children.< /text>< pics>

Call before you make the trip. Owner is inconsistent with hours and can change at will like in our experience listed below. He's nice at first to get you in the door but becomes an unpleasant person once he gets your money. Showed us his collection and then things changed...

Don't recommend...owner doesn't care for business so i won't give him mine. 1st visit was pleasant. We won 2 free games and then came back to play our 2nd game the next day and he closed early. Called before and confirmed his hours and drove 2 hours to find out he closed early. Thanks for a waste of time. Glad we didn't bring our kids because there would have been lots of tears.

Be open when you say you are open. You turned down 10 people wanting to play so you could have your silly car show. Won't be back and won't recommend. His response to my review should be enough to show his character. No apology, just grumpy old man speak. Time to retire sir.<//Review>

< Review>
I saw a van I was thinking of buying; But someone told me that this particular van, often has issues with the transmission. So I went to AAMCO in Pasadena and the Manager Sadu came to greet me and asked what are the issues I’m experiencing! I told him what I just wrote above. He proceeded to check the transmission fluid, he also scanned all the major systems of the van and then he test drove van. All & All Manager Sadu is Awesome! He was Courteous, Professional & One could tell he knows exactly what to look for, regarding the “Health, or lack of” of a vehicle’s transmission. In summary, If you think you may have any kinda issues with your transmission; Go See Sadu & his Professional Team of Transmission Experts!</Review>

<text>Phillip was so helpful and honest with me about the breakdown of cost and how he could help me out. Super professional and overall just a very kind man. He’s not here to overcharge like the dealerships do and gives it to you straight. He told me I could change my air filters myself and it was easy and called o’reillys so they could have the parts I needed ready for me! 10/10 would go back again for any car issues I have in the future! Thank you so much for making my life easier and helping me out with saving some money!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The nice Gentleman at this location allowed me to come in while they were a little busy to get all my questions answered and transmission checked out. They topped off my fluid to the correct level and for now my truck has stopped slipping. Thanks to everyone who helped me today on 4/2/21<//text>

They fixed what no one could. I went around to different shops for months, and I kept getting the run around. Finally , I called AAMCO Pasadena and Phillip told me to bring it in and they could get it done. They worked with me on price once they diagnosed the problem. And they fixed it in a timely manner for a great price. They were professional and the owner Sadu gave me a great warranty on the work performed. AA+ from me. Thanks Guys.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>I started hearing a kind of bad rattle sound (best I could describe it) from inside my engine, so I had my car towed over to aamco. Phillip called me the next day and told me my engine was done for, and proposed a new used engine for my car. And since my car was still under warranty I would just need to send in my proof of oil changes. I already had 4 oil changes, but I was only able to find 3 receipts. I figured the warranty company would play hard ball and say they need every piece of proof since the job would be costly$$. So I decided, instead of getting rejected I’ll just have my car towed back home and deal with the engine replacement at another time. But Phil really put my mind at ease. He assured me that just missing one receipt really isn’t enough to turn me away. He kept everything very honest. He let me know how much I may pay if by somehow they didn’t accept the claim, and how long this all may take. Long story short,I sent in what I had and was approved. My car was also ready a day earlier than projected. It’s almost 2weeks and my cars engine feels really good. I’ll be taking it in soon for a check up. S/O Phillip and the Aamco crew. I really appreciate it. Thank you<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>This place has no morales. I asked for a diagnostic to see if the place up-charged or falsely quoted. I received a charge of $4,800 for a parts list that I didn’t even acquire. The owner Sadu had no followup 6 days later after requesting the diagnostic. He had said that he “lost” the file. No real eloquent words from the business owner to be had. Really hoped he had more pertinent information to say. Probably will be on the refute to this comment. Please listen if a first time visitor! This is a very probable warning for customers. Left vehicle in worse condition than when brought in.<//Text>< Pictures>

I went in for a tune up & was told I  needed a rebuild transmission. Once I got it done my car went back twice and ended up totaled in an accident within 30 days of getting a rebuild. My car stopped moving & was rear ended. Aamco refused any accountability & the owner was very rude. The other driver was at fault but my car shouldn't had stopped moving either.</Review>

I brought my car to Richard not knowing exactly what was wrong with it. I actually thought it was the transmission however after they completed an extended diagnostic procedure they found out that it wasn't the transmission. Instead it was a faulty fuel pressure regulator that needed replacement. Richard was honest and professional. Him and the rest of his team at AAMCO (Pasadena, CA) are highly skilled and provided, by far, the best customer service I've ever experienced from an Auto shop. I strongly recommend them for any of your car issues. Kudos to you Richard and thank you for the great service.<//Text>

This entire experience was terrible. The shop took my car to another repair shop to fix it because they were to inexperienced to service my car. They never told they were going to do this. It broke down 2 times afterwards needing a total of 3 rebuilds of the transmission. AAMCO is unprofessional and engaging in deceitful practices. They also withheld the paperwork so I couldn't verify what they had done to my car. Completely corrupt organization. I would never recommend your company to anyone. I even had communication with your support services who just turned their back on my complaints! What kind of service are you running here? If a franchise is unable to repair a car they have accepted then why wouldn't they take the car to another AAMCO franchise? Why go to an independent shop? Obviously AAMCO can no longer fix transmissions!!!< /Text>

I took my car in because I was having break trouble and from the moment I drove into the shop Richard greeted me and took care of everything. He was very transparent- showing me the repairs to my car that was needed and communicating with me every step of the way.  I value Richard's transparency and he has made a loyal customer out of me!

I had to come back a second time for car issues and I still give this place five stars!
They are so kind and helpful there.
Richard especially has the best customer service. He is very knowledgeable about cars and was so helpful to me!<//review>< Time>

<text>Thanks Richard, your the best. You took care of me from the beginning. I am on a tight budget and you made it work. The service was great. He took the time to take pictures to show me what was going to be done. The truck sounds great and feels good too.</text>< Pics>

<Review>These guys are the BEST!  Matt went above and beyond to get my 2009 Ford Escape back on the road.  His service, expertise, and calm professional demeanor put me at ease right away.  He made sure everything was fixed and didn't pressure me to get any unnecessary service done.  Nobody ever wants to see the check engine light come on and I was expecting the worst, but was more than relieved at the final cost. Thank you for your honest, incredible service Matt!  You have a life customer and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone your way!</Review><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>

<Text>Mr. Richards was beyond helpful in letting me know if certain parts were in stock over the phone and then immediately got my car worked on when I arrived. I probably saved over 2 hours coming here, and there was a deal on brakes that saved me money. My car rides great now thanks to the Pasadena AAMCO.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2dc70b24e765f:0x5372344a888c9251<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>They high balled me on the repair after neglecting to describe all the options available. Then one of the mechanics offered to buy my car. I waited around for him to come back to get his information. I asked him how much he'd be willing to offer me and he wouldn't give me an offer. Then his boss came over and warned me about him trying to fix cars as a freelancer. I explained to him how the other person working there told me the price for repairs was higher than another place I got a quote from. Then he looked at my car again and said how it didn't have much left in it.

The whole experience made me uncomfortable and was a great example of why people don't trust auto mechanics.< /Review>< name>

I brought my car here on 2/18 not knowing what was wrong and very worried. I came to the shop right when it opens at 8am. Richard helped me right away. He was very professional and was able to give me a diagnosis right away. He patiently answered all my questions. I am very happy with the service.<//Text>

I brought my car in for what I thought were the break pads, turned out I needed new rotors and I bent one of the calipers. Richard Marenco took great care of me.  He explained all the problems and helped work with me to get it resolved.  I was dreading bringing my car in for service but he made it easy.  My car no longer makes horrible grinding noises and that makes me very happy! He even checked in with me after I had a chance to drive the car to make sure everything was working as I expected! Thank you, Richard and AAMCO Pasadena.<//review>

<review>Sadu has good customer service. I have good experience with his auto repair shop. He is one of a few owners that will get his own hands dirty diagnosing and doing some fixing on my car and customers cars. He's been in business 25 years and I know him for some years he's doing something right.< /review>< Pictures>

I have a 1997 Geo Tracker, and the automatic transmission was slipping.  Aamco was having a hard time finding the parts to fix it.  A really hard time.  But they kept at it, and yesterday I got a call, saying the Tracker was ready for pick-up.  So kudos to Aamco, for not giving up.< /Text>

The worst, most incompetent employees work the office. Took them 2 hours to tell me they couldn't fix my car. And I only found out because I called them wondering what was taking so long. I even had an appointment! Save yourself a trip and a whole lot of frustration, take your business elsewhere. This is the last time I go to this aamco..<//Text>

The bottom cover of my car was missing bolts and hanging off and I wanted to fix it the same day. I called morning last minute to shops around the area-- all saying there'd either be a 3 hr wait or I'd need to pick up the car till the end of the day. When I called AAMCO, Matt answered and told me to just come in and they'd fix it on the spot (even though the shop was going to close in less than an hr) and I was taken care of quickly by two mechanics plus they were kind enough to bolt it back up using their own leftover screws!! Not only did they save me money, but also gave me tips about the car and answered all/any car mechanical questions I had while they were fixing on it. It was a 5/5 experience and they seemed honest!< /text>

I took my 65 mustang to get the timing and carburetor adjusted. They could not get it right and found that I needed a valve job. I did not believe them until the mechanic showed me the problem doing a vacuum test. They had my car for 3 days worked on it and gave it back to me to see if I wanted a second opinion. I wanted to pay them for their time and they would not take payment! Pretty stand up an honest people!< /Text>

I URGE YOU TO GET A SECOND OPINION. They wanted to charge me $800 just to take apart the transmission to figure out what was wrong, then from there I was told the cost could be at a minimum $1800 altogether but could go as high as $3000! I took my car somewhere else and it ended up just being a broken mount. 100 bucks later, the problem is fixed, and the guy was able to figure it out with just driving my car. Don't let these salesmen talk you into doing anything without getting a second opinion first.<//text>

My 2014 Honda Accord was having noise problem in the front. I took it to a shop in Pasadena, they took whole day to check and told me , when I called back, that I need a new tranmission and it will cost $4000.00. I brought it back as could not afford that kind of money. I was told by my friend about local AAMCO , so check on line they have very good reviews and are in business for 50+ years, national chain of transmission specialists. So I went there, manager was very professional and friendly. They give me a ride back to my home. With in few hours they called saying it is not transmission , but a wheel bearing costing me only $350.00 with transmission service included. I told all my friend that, AAMCO is the place to go!< /text>

AAMCO seems to be the only legit mechanic shop in Pasadena. They actually know cars and care for them, and you deal directly with the mechanics, not some irreverent teen who knows nothing about cars. I got my entire clutch replaced here for a reasonable price. Great customer service<//Text>

This place has really gone down hill. Robert Bock used to be the shop manager here. Well he's gone and what replaced him has some mental challenges to say the least. I took my vehicle in to get it fixed at 7:45 am to be the first customer. This was pre- arranged the previous afternoon. They had my vehicle about one hour before I get a call about the extended inspection that costs $130.00. I agreed and waited to find out the problem. And waited, and waited. Finally I called and was told give them another 25 minutes. I waited an hour and 15 minutes then called again. I was told that their inspection was not over after 5 hours. I walked around the corner to be met by the owner Sadu and a rather surly little so called mechanic guy who told me they were not done with the inspection. I pre arranged to have the work done by 3 pm because I had to go to work and was told it might take days. Days for what I asked, no answer. The so called mechanic tried to be a tough guy and almost got slapped because of his attitude. They had my vehicle for 5 hours and could not tell me what was wrong and got a attitude when they violated the agreement. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. The owner may be nice but his employees leave a lot to be desired and they have become a clip joint trying to extort money for a so called through inspection.<//Review>

I had the best professional service at this site. They're constantly busy, but the turnover is expected because of the quality service provided. Not only did Robert fix my car, he restored my confidence in mechanics. I would totally recommend him to anyone who has car trouble.<//review>

I was quite upsetting considering the cost was more then my car is worth, but I can't afford a new car so I bit the bullet and did the repair.

I think the service is great, but I have an issue with the pricing. It has consistently been more expensive then the verbal quoted price for service. Even after the "discount" that I am given I pay considerably more than expected. I need upfront and honest pricing.<//Text>

Matt is the man... I trust him . He went through my mustang step by step before we rebuilt my transmission.  It acted funny after the repair, he took it back and fixed the problem at no extra cost. All my cars will be there for my repairs from now on.<//Review>

They find the problem and repair it quickly, typically the same day. Prices are very reasonable as well. I will definitely keep coming back. Thanks Aamco!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

Thanks for all your help.  The Honda has not missed a beat since the throttle body was cleaned.  Pulled the 5th wheel to Twenty Nine Palms and the truck did not even think of over heating since the repairs on the cooling system.  The caddy is also running well.   Thanks again!</text>

Came in to Aamco really nervous about my car problems. These guys took great care of me with free diagnostic to let me know what the problem was. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Rob took his time and explained to me what was going on, then went through a general course of action on how they were going to fix it. Nathan was the mechanic who treated my car as if it were his own. This is the type of service which gave me confidence that my vehicle was in good hands. After all was said and done got a great quote on what needed to be done. Thanks again Aamco!<//review>

< Review>
Disrespectful Thieves:

Came in thinking I would have honest and descent men working on my car, instead they were the complete opposite. I had a "service engine soon" light go off. I took it to O'Riley to get free computer diagnostic test, they gave me the code. Decided I would bring my car to this Pasadena location to have a more thorough diagnostic, which was recommended by my out of state Aamco mechanic. Took my car in at 8:30am, I was promised a speedy diagnosis of the problem. It took half a day for Georg to get back to me, only to inform me that it would now cost $125 to do more diagnosing, said it would take a couple hours but, would be able to tell me what's wrong with my car. At 4:58pm two minutes before closing their shop I called to get an update on the status of my car. George then told me it would cost me an additional $895 dollars to do more diagnosing because they weren't sure on why the the light came on. I then decided not to move forward, I wasn't going to pay over $1000 just to diagnose the problem and not have it repaired. My car had no issues not even a suspicious sound. Car was running great except for this light that came on. George seemed to be confused by my decision and said I didn't have to that, they would work on my car. I told him I wanted a 2nd opinion and would be there the next day to pick up my car. I got a phone call at 7:50pm from George and to sum it up I was compared to a 19 year old child with zero knowledge of cars, I was talked down by George and his insinuation were just so not called for. I'm 43, with a professional career who grew up with a father, brother and many of cousins who had a passion for cars, competive showing and the obvious fixing cars. When I went to pick up my car the next day George wanted to have small talk I wasn't interested, he then introduced me to the owner Sadu=great guy. I feel sorry and bad for him, to have employees that have zero respect for customers and who treat them as disposable as they come. He also has employees that Steal from customers. As I drove off I noticed something missing and my glove compartment had been ruffled. I can't believe that not only did they want to take advantage of me financially, and  their disrespectful manner of communication, they also STEAL from customers. Unbelievable, the sad part in all of this, is that most of the employees there are Hispanic. All I can think and say is; HOW DARE YOU ACT THIS WAY!< /Review>

< Review>
I am happy to give this AAAMCO location a 5 Star  rating .  Very professional and experienced in a wide range of areas and inclusive of a wide range of vehicles. I brought in my 2004 BMW 325i w/ 84,000 miles  with a loss of power . It was rapidly diagnosed and repaired . Now my vehicle runs like new with excellent smooth shifting and full power to spare.  An Enterprise rental is less than a  block away , within easy walking distance . The pricing for repairs was very reasonable and owner proprietor is extremely knowledgeable as well as friendly and professional. I recommend this shop to anyone in need of repairs to powertrain , transmissions or electrical systems.
A happy customer .I will bring all my cars here,

<name>Sara Lopez<//name><Review>Aamco is my trusted Michanic they can fix  everything and on any car. I brought my N/O Mazda mx6 And I told them to just get it started and they did. I brought them my 66 ford f100. I asked them to change the oil pump and breaks the job was done quickly and I was amazed at how much they charged. It was a lot cheaper than I had expected and the truck sounds great. I'm very pleased with their service and I hope many others are as well.

<Review>I just want everyone to know in the city of Pasadena, that the owner of this AAmco is the Best. Robert still looks out for his customers needs. I have a 1995 Olds Aurora that had some computer issue I thought, after he told me that he ran some test with the computer and it was bad I went bought a New one for him to put in. after he in stalled the new computer some of the problems were still there. he then went thru to find out that the wiring harness had some issues and needed to replace. the harness was not available so he took it among himself to repair the harness for me. this is a very time consuming task. after that was done he called me and told me my car is fixed and is running like it was when it was Brand New . I don't that there is anyone else that would have put in the Extra effort with out just telling me I cant fix it or charging me a stupid amount to fix it. Robert thank you so Much!!!</Review>< user_id>

Nice layout but not worth $65.use to play this course 1-2 times a week.  Greens are great but fairways and rough are horrible. With so many golf courses closing over the past few years they are definitely taking advantage. We been going to Stockton. Much nicer courses and cheaper to play. Well worth the drive.< /Text>

Give this course a try! The front 9 will lead you to believe it's on the flat side.Tee to green that is , now the greens are sneaky sloped. Just when you feel this is sinking the hole , reality check hits you.The greens are a challenge with the gentle yet ball commanding lines. Overall wide open. Now you are hit with a few tight fairways so the long holes are not just grip it and rip it . At the end you will finish off  last two holes with the dramatic elevation changes and sloped fairways . Don't  at anytime take your eye off the ball. The ball will vanish on you with going into the neighboring properties. And the staff was very hospitable and the service is great! Enjoy and got'em straight.<//text>

<text>Today we played this course for the first time. The fairways are wide, and the greens are fast and well maintained. Some holes have large barren areas of dirt...waste areas?? There were a couple of times when we couldn't find the next hole--it wasn't so obvious. Better signs to direct you to the next hole would help a lot, especially if you never played it. Overall, a nice, challenging course.</text></record>

<rating>2</rating><review>Had a teatime for 12:22 PM and was not able to get on at 11:40 PM. My foursome decided to leave. Management was cranky and came up with a bunch of excuses for why they were running an hour and a half behind schedule. In the end, this is the only course I know that I’ve been to the last two times where there have been delays. Manager needs to do a better job of setting up teetimes for the day given the amount of cards they have in use.The course itself is average but the greens are well-kept up and fast.Manteca golf course has much better course conditions and service.< /review>< Pics>

<review>The course is in descent shape and getting better every time I play there, but the range is getting worse every time. The price of the range use to be $6 for half an hour which is a good deal, especially since I sometimes pay for my family total of 4 for $24. Then all within a 7 month period they went up to $8 and then $10 and now they are $8 for a small bag of 20 to 25 balls and $14 for a bag of maybe 50 balls. This is not cool especially when the golf mats are torn and tees are missing and torn side netting near the third hole. The balls are warn down so bad that they hardly have any dimples.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The greens were in great shape and rolled well for a 1pm round. There are some odd dry spots on the course but I can only assume they water where it's necessary because this area gets pretty hot. Range is short and if you can carry over 240 yardage you can hit the back net but this is finable of 100$ if you hit over the net. I'll definitely make the drive from the bay area and come back to play here.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
We loved this place so much we joined in sept. Easy to get on, great greens, challenging holes. Not a typical valley course as begining and finishing holes have lots of hills. Lots of recent improvements too. Our board is doing a great job. Solar panels next to #9 help with the sustainability.  If you are a Tracy Golfer, consider joining. Chris and Kendall are great pros and chris is a fantastic golf pro and fitter.  My relaxation zone.< /Review>

The greens were smooth and tricky and a great improvement from being so shaggy and slow. Fairways still aren't the best but it was still a great day outside.<//Review>< Resp>

The course has been improved a lot since I last played ,  tee boxes are good along with nice smooth greens.  The only minus is that  there were people congratulating outside drinking with no masks on.</Text>

<review>This ain't no cake walk, it's just as hard as you make it. If you are a golfer who blames bad shots on everything except the one holding the clubs, you better off staying home. Great place to play, everyone is friendly, good food also.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We stumble upon this course looking for new places around our area to play. The course is in very nice condition, the cost is very reasonable for a course like this. the greens are very challenging and well kept. The staff was very kind and courteous. My wife is new to the game and was pleasantly surprised of what it was like to play on a really nice course instead of our Hack training courses we have been learning on. Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice course and very friendly staff.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80903a6184d98259:0xb8592c4d6f208de6<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very nice staff. Very forgiving course, wide fairways. Medium fast greens. The course is a little beat up and dry in some areas, but overall pretty nice. I will play the course again.< /review>

<name>Annika Hauschildt<//name><text>The course can be a little challenging to play for those who haven't played before, but it quickly becomes a favorite for golfers of all skill levels. Some long par 4s and short par 3s make for an interesting mix of difficulty throughout the course.

The course is generally pretty nice and the people are very friendly. Occasionally during summer and dry months the grass can become very dry and during winter and wet months the grounds can flood. Some fairways have dirt patches in them, but the grass is overall green amd healthy.< /text><user>111934780200998574023</user></record></dataset><record>

Price was great, challenging course in my opinion, and very well kept up. Carts were charged, staff was super friendly even though we weren't members, and other golfers were super friendly as we had a bit of trouble finding some of the holes ...<//Review>

<review>I lived in this neighborhood about six years ago and began coming here to have my Volkswagen Passat washed(carpets, seats, full dressing etc.). They have always done a great job for a good price...With a friendly helpful staff; they will look at your car and make suggestions. I’ve tried other car washes over the years but I keep coming back to visit even though I live in Carlsbad Village.  It is worth my time and drive.< /review><user_name>Alex Anger< /user_name>< response>

I have been having my car washed and waxed here for some time. The most recent wax, I discovered that they were not able to do anything  to address the issue I  had experienced and did not disclose this until AFTER they completed the wax which I paid for. Additionally, they did not offer alternatives. Seriously disappointed.< /review>

< Review>
We have been traveling with our big, blonde dog. He sheds like it's his job. The back seat of my truck was COVERED in hair. The long kind that gets in between the fibers of the carpet.

These guys got rid of all the hair and cleaned the rest of the car for a really reasonable price.< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Came here to a hand wash and a wax complete with wheel shine. I also had my interior wiped down with a shine in my seats.
However their work as far as hand washing goes is sub par. Swirling working in random order on parts of the car. Using old rags that have lost in color and old stains. They do wash their rags. They do work really fast. However, not worth the near $80 I spent for micro clear coat scratches covered in glossy wax.
I don't know the products they use, but it definitely does last past a week.
I recommend it for vehicles that just need a quick decent wash.<//review>< user_name>

< review>
I had let my truck go to long since it's last wash and was really busy but wanted to get it clean frim my last road trip. I looked for "Hand Wash" car washes online and this one came up. Since I needed to go to Lowes I chose this car wash. I  pulled in and was met by friendly staff.  I paid and as I  went to sit dowb I realized that this was not a true hand wash facility.  The would have been more truthful had the said brushless.  I was too late to stop the process by this time and was watching my truck going through the long blu strips putting micro scratches into my paint.  I  should have called ahead. Lesson learned as I will do it myself from now on. Being in a hurry never pays.< /review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>Great Car way but save your money on a full detail, paid 250$ for the clay wax and interior full detail.
There was so much armor all on the tires it instantly kicked up all over the vehicle spotting the wax.
And the chemicals used on the interior made it look great but now haunt my truck with a nauseating chemical smell that I can’t cover up with air fresheners.
Save your money on a full detail. Besides that really nice guys.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1581549065876, 'text': 'Bring you vehicle back at your convenience, and we will do what ever you like to make your happy . What kind of truck was it?'}< /Response>< gmapID>

I've been a regular customer for 5 years and I'm always amazed how the owner Dave can offer top qualify work at affordable prices!  I needed my wife's car completely detailed and was short on time so Dave doubled up the detail crew and finished the work in record time.  I'm  a very picky guy and always pleased with the work.  I recommend Santa Fe Car Wash!!< /review>

I’ve used this car wash for years love that they have coupons so it makes it affordable compared to others. But the last few times I feel like they just do as good of a job . I have noticed that they don’t vacuum properly underneath the matts, they also don’t clean the center consul as good as they used to , or the doors like to use to...  I guess I get what I pay for “/< /review>

Not the best place to get a carwash. Don't get me wrong , the employees are really nice. But it takes so long for your car to be cleaned. Sat in the waiting area so long my back hurt. Did a good job just not good enough for the price and quality. Most likely won't go back.< /text>

Best car wash in all of North County, very detailed and amazing prices. They treat you very well, always ask you if there is anything specific you would like for your car not including what is already cleaned with the car wash you selected. Yolanda in the cashier both always greets you with a smile and has the best positive attitude that brightens anyone's day. Car wash staff is attentive and i am extremely satisfied taking my vehicles there all the time.</text>

And the guy says I don't know what to tell you. So at booth I asked the lady for more information about their packages and she like I have no control over what they charge.  Maybe the weekends they lack service because of busyness but I've been loyal to them and now taking service somewhere else.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Horrible service, broke a plastic part on my seat of my new car and claimed they were not responsible. Brought them my flawless charger and soon as they were done I noticed a part of the side of my seat was hanging and I could see the gears that move my seat forward and backwards. Showed the manager and he glanced at it and said that none of his workers did that. And then casually walked away as if nothing happended. This part was NOT broken when I gave them my car!!!! Extremely disappointed with their customer service and lack of care when a customers car gets damaged.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I went by to get a car wash at 2 PM today.  I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes without anyone coming up to me.  There were two people vacuuming and cleaning a car in front of me, and another person on his phone in a chair beside me.  After 5 minutes I started to leave.  The person in the chair called out to some people, and pointed at me.  I waited for a minute or two, but since no one responded, I left.</review>< pics>

I gave this place more than one opportunity but sadly after reading the reviewes of not getting what you pay for the higher end services, and being charged more than what you ordered I have had the same experience.  I paid for the extra services and after drying my car they honked and said it was done.  When I spoke up the workers seemed irritated they had to spend some extra time on my car?  Sat I ordered the Super Wash for $14.99 gave a $2 off coupon and was charged $19.99.  This has happened more than once to me and apparently to others.  Pay attention to your receipt.<//Text>

Terrible experience, got mud all over my carpet, they started taking it off by hitting it and dust got all over my black car. They didn’t offer anything towards it, not even another wash to the dusted car. These guys suck!<//Review>

The manager was friendly, helpful and personable. He was able to be so helpful because he has few years of experience in this business; the man knows flora and customer service. He specializes in Victorville with a kid living in the city...so if you're looking to send something to your kid, regardless of age, he'll make sure it gets there on time.<//text>

<text>On 3/6/21 @ 2:00pm I went to 1-800-Flowers/Conroys Flowers. I asked one of the 2 ladies for help in looking for a sympathy arrangement. “Sophie/Sophia” was the lady I spoke to. She quickly told me to just walk around and look at the arrangements they have. As I walked around looking, nothing appealed to me as there wasn’t much of a selection & the limited selection they had was wilted, dry or looked bare. I went back to the front, spoke to “Sophie/Sophia” again....asking her if there were any other arrangements I could look at. She told me I can look online, then show her, but the arrangement wouldn’t get made today because all of the “designers” have already gone home for the day.  (Saturday hours are 9am - 7pm)
I said “Thank you” & left. Very disappointed ...unprofessional & unhelpful.<//text><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I went in on Sunday afternoon needing an arrangement for a Memorial service and these 2 ladies (sorry I didn't get their names) were so accommodating!  They were so nice, friendly and helpful!  They helped me pick out the perfect arrangement and we even added some things to it, to make it even better.  The tin pot, it was in, was so perfect!  It said, "Peace", on it and had a picture of a white dove so we placed a stick with a white dove, on top, sticking out of the arrangement.  The customer service was top-notch and the prices were great as well!  I definitely recommend you stop in, if you are ever in need of a quick plant or floral arrangement.</Text>

<Review>When I went to order the Rose's the lady there was nice and professional as far as the delivery it's horrible. I  literally  live right next to their business. They don't seem to care call them up to tell them that my wife was about to leave and they   seems like whatever,  I don't think I would be going back to them wich sucks cause out hear no one has good fresh flowers. They were decent.. all dying because they took them in a hot van all over town. Definitely not going there ever.<//Review>< pics>

My husband purchased an arrangement for my birthday, picked them up the day before(7/2), placed them in the fridge outside to surprise me when I awoke the next morning(7/3). There were wilted rosebuds, the filler is already dropping  on the table and today (7/4), it looks like a cheap bouquet  of fillers from Walmart. Beyond disappointed in the quality, especially considering the amount  of money he spent and his thoughtfulness.</text>

Bought a bouquet of roses for my girlfriend. Noticed some roses were starting to get wilted when I got to the car. Walked back inside and mentioned it to the staff. They exchanged the dry looking roses. Less than a week later they’re wilted. My experience with flowers has been they typically last longer than a few days... these were pricey so I wish they lasted longer than they did.</text>

Ordered flower delivery for mothers day four days prior and received email confirmation.  Conroy's called me two days later stating they were too busy and asked to deliver the day before mothers day.  As the recipients were out of town Saturday, I told them that wouldn't work and they assured me the flowers would be delivered as promised.  They delivered Saturday regardless.  They've lost my businesa.<//Review>

<review>Promised and paid for "SAME DAY SERVICE" threw 1800flowers.
Anticipating a joyful call from mom to say she received the flowers I sent...
Had I not followed up, would anyone let me know?
Having to blow "the surprise" >>
A day and half later, several phone calls and much time on hold...
Jenna with "lots of attitude" called Mom saying "We don't go on dirt roads, why don't you come pick them up?"  How UNPROFESSIONAL!! Mom says "are you kidding me, this was supposed to be a surprise delivery of flowers to me from my daughter in Chicago!"
Not to mention lying to 1800flowers saying you attempted to deliver..after telling mom you didn't bother, due to the dirt road.
By the way mom is 2 doors down from ASFALT. Then you/your shop should NOT have taken the order.
If Jenna would have been kind or apologetic this review would have been different.
Tone and professionalism goes a long way. The fact that you will not deliver to dirt road is not the issue, it's the way you spoke to mom and wasted our time.< /review>< pics>

We have been ordering arrangements for as long as Conroy's has been here and they have always been lovely.  Whether they were locally delivered or ordered for family out of state, all were impressed by their arrangements.  I recently ordered a graduation arrangement via phone, the staff member was so very helpful and polite.  I told her what my graduate liked and she helped me find the perfect arrangement; it was delivered the same day and the young lady was ecstatic. I can't say enough good things about Conroy's because we have had great experiences.< /Text>

This bouquet was beautiful online, however, when Mom sent to a thank you picture...MY EYES COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT I SAW. For $129 a mom should expect to get a WOW FACTOR.

<review>I came here today looking for baby's breath for my best friend's bridal  shower. The girl that helped me, Crystal, was wonderful. She showed me how to cut them down and put them into the mason jars. She even let me know that if I needed more to just let her know in advance and she'd order the bunches for me. I'll definitely be coming back.</review><rate>5</rate>< time>

<Text>Long story short I placed an order for delivery and was received in great condition. Then a couple days later a few roses began to die. So I called them up and without hesitation they told me to bring them in and they would have a fresh bouquet ready for me. All in all I had a great encounter with 1800 flowers and would definitely recommend them.</Text>< Date>

My sister in law had her flowers made by Conroy's Flowers for her wedding. I've been in 5 weddings and these were the prettiest bouquets yet. Our dresses were in different shades of coral and I didn't know how they were going to pull it off, but they did. I just got engaged and I've already booked my appointment with Crystal to discuss my wedding.</Text>

<review>Worst service ever. Was given a guarantee delivery time before 2pm and flower were delivered at 230pm after she had left work. Second issue was the arrangement was supposed be an All-around arrangement with white roses, carnations, and Peruvian lilies (alstroemeria); blue delphinium; baby’s breath; seeded eucalyptus, and assorted greenery. What she got was 3 white roses and a vase full of carnations. Nice to know I paid $80 for carnations. I will never do business with 1800 flowers again.</review><user_name>Jayden Hollywood HILLIARD<//user_name><Time>1530364443358< /Time><gmap_id>0x80c366144989ab57:0x660bdccd8b04da12<//gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>1</rating>< response>

Ordered online for a family member. Luckily, I was there when the flowers were delivered. They sent the wrong arrangement. Then waited all day the next day to have the correct arrangement delivered. It had the correct flowers this time, however it was the a terrible job. It looks like the person didn't know what they were doing. There are gaps in the flowers. I would not recommend this shop.< /Review>

<Review>It was very disappointing.  The flower arrangements were ugly and with very few flowers.  Too expensive for so little flowers. They ended up suggesting I could do my own arrangements. I did and ended up paying $43.00 (base included) with very few flowers.  Two weeks ago I had gotten a beautiful bouquet with much more flowers from Stater Bros. for just $21.00.  It's just that everything in the high desert is so far apart I could not get to Stater Bros. in time to visit my friend. Do not go to this place. It is a rip off.<//Review>< Pics>

<Time>1458250287230</Time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>I will start off by saying I worked here awhile back. It was the most unpleasant experience I've had. I genuinely enjoyed working with my co-workers except for Crystal. She's the manager there. Upon the first few days of me working there the whole time she was training me she made me feel like if I was a complete idiot. Don't let her outer appearance fool you - even though she likes to come across always smiling happy -go attitude in reality she's a mean evil cold hearted woman. She has this wall where if you make a mistake on a order she'll dribble little notes like how teachers used to write when you failed your math test and she'll post it in the wall of shame. She also has about 50 tasks that you're supposed to complete AND you have have to sign it off with your initials everyday. I mean who does that? Only Crystal.  Soooo many girls have applied there and gotten the job and have quit shortly because of her. Then she wonders why this job is a huge turn over. I would not recommend for anyone to apply here unless if you like being belittle and ridiculed for every little mistake you do then go for it. When I quit it was literally the happiest last day working at Conroys. I hated working there. The owners seriously need to look at their management.</Review>< pics>

I was just in a wedding and my friend ordered the flowers from Conroys. They were the prettiest I have ever seen. Crystal went above and beyond to make sure my friend had nothing to worry about. She helped with the center pieces, pinned the flowers on the guys and helped us bridesmaids with any last minute touches. You know people are always quick to judge on the negative but people should share the positive experiences too. It doesn't take that long to post a positive comment. I work in customer service too and I know when people don't get their way they will throw out negativity. I will be referring Crystal and her store Conroys to my friends. Thank you again.</Text>

Bought roses and a bear for my wife, got roses from a recycled batch and a teddy bear that looked sad, like he had got into a fight with a dog before arriving at my door. Called Conroys for help, they said call 1-800 flowers, and been waiting for someone to answer for over an hour. Now my Valentine's Day has been spent trying to contact them. So no date, no dinner, no movie, and now no smile like they promised as advertised. I have learned my lesson. No more surprises for my wife, I have spent more time fixing someone else's mistake.< /text>

I odered  roses for my moms 80th birthday, online seeing Im out of town working all the time,  thought it would be easy to do that, I ordered roses and she recieved sunflowers, I Got charged 63.00 for something I didnt order, If Iwanted a cheap as flowers I Could of stopped at Stater Brothers. Then when went called the Conroys online center they asked for my email address and said someone would contact me, they never did, when I called a second time, I had to leave a message on a machine, they never responded, why CAUSE THEY GOT MY MONEY WHY SHOULD THEY, SO PLEASE DONT ORDER FROM THESE PPL, YOU SPEND HARD EARNED MONEY FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION AND YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THEIR GONNA DELIVER, KNOWING HOW CHEAP THEY ARE, THEY PROBABLY VISITED THE NEAREST CEMETERY ON A WEEKEND AND RIPPED OFF THE FLOWERS AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS CAUSE THATS HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW, IVE BEEN RIPPED OFF.< /text>

<Text>if youre looking for an unprofessional experience...heres the place for you! hubby ordered, wrong order came. they forgot to include the personalized card. he called, the lady ensured him they were going to send out another bouquet the next day. instead, 1 hour later they came back with a smaller version of bouquet and repossessed the first bouquet. wow! im in awe! they cant even keep their word on comping for the mistake in the first place...and to note, this isnt the first time they messed up! they messed up before sending the wrong balloon for the occasion...a happy birthday instead of a mothers day balloon! mistake after mistake!</Text>< pics>

The food is great the lady that took my order took the time to write down exactly right the special requests my wife made. Our food was correctly cooked. They made it pretty quick. Their phone number is 233.2426. you can call in an order. While I was there several people came in and picked up their orders.<//Text>

The place had great service and the cook did a great job with the products he was given. However- the quality of the product wasn't very good at all and the prices reflect that. It has a small town, homey feel and it looks as though a lot of regulars enjoy hanging out there. The ketchup in the bottle had been sitting a while- very fermented.< /Text>

Excellent food, super friendly staff, but very slow. Also serving people out of turn.

After 30 minutes, and everyone else getting their food, more locals arrived and those arriving 30 minutes after us got their food.

That's when we got up to leave, and that's when they finally made our order, which we got to go. And though they reread the order when paying correctly, we had the wrong items in our bag when we left.

Still, lovely family people if you are passing through and have lots and lots of time. Otherwise, given all the above, and flies, I would have given less stars.</review>

<Text>Service was slow, which is an understatement. Food was eatable...barely. Once one person working the front, who was very sweet, and a cook. If there is ANY other place open go there.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

This place is nothing special and Burgers are never fully cooked. The onion rings are the only decent thing. Even then there just frozen. I'm not impressed with this place.</text>

Went in for shocks and told me to get an alignment first. I went to ask about it and they told me it won't make a difference on the shocks. I called back a d they told me get the parts and being it the next day at 8am. I showed up early. Until 840 they opened up and gave me a difference price.  Day before they told me struts are more expensive and lo get time. Since I had the full shocks they told me less time and less money. When I showed up that day they told me I had to wait 3 hours then 4 hours for the service.  After they told me go in at 8am and they would service it right away. It was all lies. Sorry but thats very poor customer service..< /Text>

Jefe gives the best prices!!!! Gets you in and out in no time! Best shop in Hesperia for new and used tires.  Also does brakes and other small jobs if you need it done.< /review>

I went on Saturday, Tire Tech Jessy helped me! I left my vehicle for an oil change plus a change of all 4 tires, and went to the owners Mexican Restaurant Los Tres Amigos close by his tire shop. Btw the food is bomb! Jessy was very helpful and nice! The tires are in great shape! I will continue to go here< /text>

<review>Love the products and it works. I took the New Body 7day olive oil cleanse it cleaned my body out so good. I could see the green clear crystals in my stool that he talks about in the informational paper he gives out with the cleanse. I had to drink a 16oz of cold press olive oil on the first day and took the 3 different herbal supplements provided. One of which was CKLS tablets. The worst part was drinking all that oil. The hardest part was eating raw veggies and occasionally lightly cooked veggies. I did not consume meat or dairy products. The best part I reset my body and got pregnant with my 1st child a few weeks after the cleanse. I have recommended his products to friends and family and any woman trying to get pregnant.</review>< pictures>

< review>
I had a very acute migraine in one part of my brain. I had never even had a regular headaches but once every five years or so. The migraine felt like someone was sticking a sewing pin in the same exact spot every time. Dr. Goss prescribed many herbs, and a diet. A week later and I haven't had this painful experience in over 20 years. That's the business!</review>

I love it here!  So many great herbs at a good price.  I used to spend so much money on Dr. Sebi's herbs... But I learned that this place has thr same products for much cheaper.  The quality is great. I have my friends hooked on CKLS and Par K Slim Pak for weight loss.  Its really amazing!  Whatever your ailment, whatever your need, they have the herbs.  The employees are very helpful and informative.<//text>

<text>The sales associate was very helpful and looked up the book my son was inquiring about. The Cafe was delicious and reasonably priced. My son ordered a breakfast sandwich and a slice of cheesecake. We also ordered a cookie to take home to my other son. The Cafe serves Starbucks coffee but it's not a Starbucks. They do not accept Starbucks gift cards but they do accept Barnes and Noble gift cards.< /text>< pictures>

A clean, welcoming environment with a large manga selection.

Staff was very knowledgeable about manga and nerd culture. They were happy to answer all questions and even give solutions (ie. "We're out of stock but it's available at this other location") ~

I will most definitely be coming back. I would come more often if I could afford it!</Text>

<review>Very great place to find the perfect book for you. Great staff you're very helpful in finding books as well as looking them up online for you. They are even willing to order books that you would want. The gold membership is really worth it. At least 10% off as well as free shipping. Very great place to go.<//review>< date>

<Review>It's not what it use to be. Of course because of covid, they removed most of the seats, and the ones they do have are solid wood. So they can get uncomfortable. The floor is always an option. They still have a large variety of books, except the ones we were looking for, but the lady made an effort to order it for us.<//Review>< pics>

Store was very clean. I needed help with a book and the associate was very helpful, even told me about some good books my daughter may like. Only negative is that my online order was i correct, but once again the women working checked every store for me to see if they had the book</Text>

If they dont have it they'll order it for you and have it ready for you at the store in no time.  I always check the website first but it's always nice to have good customer service which this B&N does.  Great selection of gifts, books and magazines it has a new growing Manga section too.

Helpful people that didn't just search my title and point me to it, they actually took time and took me to the sections I needed to go. Chairs around to sit, Coffee to sip, and books to read. Can it get better? Only if they add a spa to the History section.</Text>< Pics>

Doing this just in case someone actually is going through my profile and now sees "oh yeah! A Barnes and Nobles!" This place can't die. Not that it's close to it, but book stores need to be preserved and cherished.< /text>

Barnes and Noble is a great resource for literature (from textbooks to self-help to magazines) and a great place to kill time. They offer a cafe that serves signature Starbucks beverages. Their staff are incredibly helpful and if they don’t have a resource you are looking for, they are quick to help you find a workaround to get it.< /Review>

<Text>My grandson had a great time looking for a book. With all of the toys and slushies I had a somewhat hard task of keeping him on task, but we got a book, bypassed the toys and went to the cafe to get a cookie for his lunch dessert.  We had a WONDERFUL time all for under $10.00!  I couldn't ask for a better quality time spent with my "special guy". :-)<//Text>< date>

<review>Quiet atmosphere, large selection and people willing to help. Any time I can't find what I am looking for they're willing to look for it at another store, online or find a way to order. I had a huge 30 book children's book order and needed before my daughter's birthday and not only did they make it happen but gathered all of them faster than expected, found a way to get them discounted, and called me to make sure I knew they were there. I have been shopping there since childhood, my parents used to take me there to do homework since they were open later than libraries. I'm very glad they have the cafe back, the kids cookies or a treat for their birthdays.<//review>< user_name>

This is my local B&N so it's the closest one to me. It doesn't get much love, because it's not super fancy (one story, no music dept). However, we need to support them or we won't have this location to go to. This store is close to my heart because I worked there 15 years ago. This store keeps on trucking and I'm so glad it's still a part of the shopping center.<//Review>

All I want to say is Shelli has a very bad attitude. Very unwelcoming, rude, aggressive towards customers. The way she was interacting with guests made it seem as if she truly disliked her job.</text>

<review>This is my Happy Place!!
Although there was an employee there being loud and obnoxious.
Which he stated he knew it and oh well cause that's jusy who he is.
All I could think of is, RUDE!
Other than that, another wonderful trip to my happy place.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Barnes and Noble is an excellent book store. I was able to find a few books and read them in there. They also sell plenty of other things like stuffed animals and lap desks. It is perfect for old and young people. Employees are very helpful and nice. I would love to go there again</review>< Pictures>

This is a super fun place for a teacher to shop! I always manage to find something 😊. The store is quiet enough so that you can browse to your heart's content, yet it is never difficult to find an employee when you need one.

10 out of 10, highly recommend!</review>

<Review>CUSTOMERS OF COLOR BEWARE: THEY MIGHT DISCRIMINATE YOU! This store is really small and outdated and some employees might be racist.The staff here acted way too bust to try and help me. I asked for assistance in the kids area and they sent me to customer service. It was inconvenient for me since I was on my lunch break on a Tuesday🙄. None of the employee's I encountered were friendly nor helpful to me. However, they were very nice to an older white couple that asked for assistance in the kids area and they were helped immediately. Perhaps I was born the wrong color....< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>The staff was amazing. While they were in the middle of reorganizing the store and the item I was looking to buy for my daughter was not on display, they promptly went to get it from the back for her. They also had a treat for her and made her smile. They helped us find everything we were looking for, on top of helping every other customer find what they needed. I would be happy going the extra distance to shop here instead of a location closer to me because of the great customer service.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><date>1540316878085</date></record>

Came at closing time to browse and wound up buying a book on The Vietnam (American) War, more specifically the battle of Hue. Spent more than I would have on Amazon but if we all purchased online we wouldn't have a book store to visit.<//Review>

I enjoy reading when I can make time. Totally love collecting books this way I have more knowledge of facts about all I put myself to learn. History, biographies, adventure, science fiction, thrillers,  religious you name it. The reading world can be endless.<//Review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>I really like this store. Other than Barnes and Noble charging a rediculous amount of money for their books (which I know the store doesn't control) it's always clean inside. The staff are very helpful and keep an engaging environment. They have a coffee shop inside that sells some Starbucks. I wish I could come here to study but the tables there just aren't big enough and there isn't enough seating (-1⭐️ for that) Otherwise it is a great store</text>< resp>

<Text>Took away some of the comfortable sitting areas and Starbucks is gone. One manager I observed is terrible and rude but she wasn't there last time I visited.  Nice teacher rewards program.  Staff must understand their clientele who are folks that enjoy visiting a bookstore and the atmosphere created in it, if not we'll just order on Amazon.  Don't follow your rude managers precedent,  love your customers and welcome them with a warm comfortable reading and purchasing environment!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>100475206016713869175<//UserId.>< Rate>

<text>The service is friendly and welcoming, great selection of products but the attraction here is the coffee shop. There's a line out the door for coffee and you have to fight for a table. They serve Starbucks products and don't accept the Starbucks app to pay since they aren't officially a Starbucks. The bookstore is another story, it has no identity. It feels like BestBuy before it moved away from DVDs. They don't match Amazon prices so instead of losing a few dollars on margin they lost all of it. I don't see BN lasting much longer without a new business model.<//text>< pictures>

Every time I come to this store, I'm always told they don't carry a lot of thing's and that, I would do better to look ONLINE and find it. I needed something right now, and they said, they would have to order it. That wasn't going to help at all. They Need to have a wider Selections of books. I don't want to order, that's WHY, I went to the store.
The store was quiet and clean, and a real nice sales woman helped me as much as she could.<//text>

I love book stores. Unfortunately most book stores have went out of business due to online companies such as Amazon. I love the smell of a book store actually browsing isles, and flipping the pages in my hand. Barnes and Noble has so much more to offer than just books. Keep our treasured book store alive by being a patron at the fine establishment.< /text>

I don't hate Barnes and Noble
But there is not a lot that changes.
I never have time to pick out anything.
Except magazines.  Would go back.  Maybe.  To look for a good book to read.  Basically.  It is all in English.</Review>

Always love the joy of coming into a bookstore and just scanning the shelves whether it's for something specific or just hoping to find something new. Employees were extremely helpful when I asked for a specific novel.<//Text>

<text>Great spot to pick up a good read. The cafe is ok, not my favorite. I really like the large book selection for all types of readers. The staff is usually helpful and willing to recommend stuff. Twice a year clearance that is a deal. Usually starts at 25% off then goes 50 and 75 eventually.<//text>< Pics>

I was trying to find a book needed for my daughter's AP literature class. They were out, but had ordered more. We needed it sooner than order was coming in. They helped me by calling two other stores to find us a copy. I'm very happy with the help that I received.< /review>

Smaller than most book stores I've been to. Although it was small it had all the books I was looking for. People here were willing to help. Didnt spend to much time there but would definitely go back.</text>

B&N stores are usually good places - not always - and this is a good one. It would benefit from a video department and a Starbucks but then I am used to those amenities in our regular store. Overall this is a good location.< /review>

<review>I tend to agree with the reviewers before me. This store doesn't seem to have the luster it once had when it opened. The Starbucks connected to the store is a great idea, but it's rather small as most of it's seating is outside. Overall, it's not the first bookstore I'd choose to go to.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

If I can put ZERO or minus stars, I would.  On the 29th of Dec 2018,  My wife  found children's books at Barnes & Noble website "on sale" that can be purchased online & pick up at the chosen store. My wife  went to the Rancho Cucamonga store to be told by the cashier that the books are not on sale & that "they do not price match" what's online. She emailed BN's customer service that same evening.  It is now 10 o'clock in the evening of January 1st 2019 and my wife or I have yet to hear from BN.</text>

One of the last real book stores left in the area.  It's stocked well (maybe not like the good o'l days), and the staff is helpfull.  The adjoining Starbucks closed a few years ago, so you don't have the vib there once was.  Let's support our remaining bookstores!<//Review>

The cashier was not very friendly at all. Asked if I wanted to join their discount program for $25.00. Unless you buy a lot of books, it's not worth the investment.</Text>

Its horrible. The people aren't very happy to help at all, they give you a rude look when you ask for something, and not at all welcoming. A few years ago they took away the magazine seating area, took away chairs, and patched up all the wall plugs to make sure nobody charges their phones or laptops. Barnes and Noble doesn't even give coupons. Its why competition is so important.

Borders always welcomed customers with friendly service, constantly gave 40% off coupons every week, and never acted as selfish as B&N has. I just get everything from Amazon now or go to the library nearby.

Highly recommend the Montclair mall B&N, they have more in stock, starbucks seating area, more inventory and they aren't greedy with letting people relax and read a book. Well worth the extra drive.</Review>

< Review>
I thought one of the few advantages of brick-and-mortar bookstores was the welcoming environment and the ability to go there and study or quietly hang out for a little while. Not so at this store. The employees are not that friendly, there are no tables, there are few chairs and the ones there are are bolted to the wall, and although there is very mediocre wifi, they get upset if you plug in and with nowhere to sit and put your laptop or books there's no point in it anyway.

I generally make it a point to buy from any store that has wifi and is gracious about allowing me to use it, but due to the unwelcoming staff and environment, I put the books I was going to buy back on the shelves and left to go to the library.<//Review>

<text>Worst experience i order book for my som couple weeks ago and called them in the morning to ask about the price and they said it arrived couple days ago and we are open till 9pm you can come pick it up.
I asked them i received email said it will be ready on oct 3rd which after two days they said no it is here now.
I went to pick it up another person said we are sorry the book here but we can not give it we do not know who told and manager even worse she is ignorant and not professional.
Never buy anything from them or any other barns and nobles</text>< Pictures>

Was able to find the book I was looking for. Their rewards program seems expensive and unless you buy a lot, not worth it.< /text>

I remember when it was a book store, now it's a junk shop with toys everywhere, collectables, but mostly toys, which is not what I want my kids to see when I'm shopping for a book for them to be interested in......when I asked about it I got ignored.....just looked at me and said nothing.....</Text>

(Translated by Google) As always the perfect place to read a little before choosing a good book, they have a variety of family board games and also strategy, customer service is excellent. I hope this place continues for many years, as with technology it seems that these types of places are going to disappear, I recommend supporting the culture by buying books in this type of business.

Como siempre el lugar perfecto para leer un poco antes de elegir un buen libro, tienen una gran variedad de juegos de mesa familiares y también de estrategia, la atención al cliente es excelente. Ojalá este lugar siga por muchos años, ya que con la tecnología cada vez parece que este tipo de lugares van a desaparecer, les recomiendo apoyar la cultura comprando libros en este tipo de negocios.<//review>
