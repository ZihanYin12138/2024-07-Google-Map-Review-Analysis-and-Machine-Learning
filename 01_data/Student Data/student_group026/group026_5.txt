I went there before the pandemic and got really bad service.  I was surprised to See it reopen after the lockdown.  They totally wasted my time and made me sit there for an hour and then denied me service because they allegedly didn’t have time to do the cut.  It was definitely awkward since only the girl who was setting up the appointments acknowledged me and all the barbers acted like I wasn’t even sitting there the entire time. The owner sent me a fake apology weeks later.  Now it doesn’t look as busy when I walk by.< /review>

<text>Before I started to grow my hair, I would always go to this shop to have my monthly haircut. I don't trust barbershops because they would always ruin my hair. Most barbershops don't give excellent results about hairstyles. But this shop always meets my expectations. I really love my haircut. Thanks!<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I was a die-hard customer for the first few years, but their business model has become challenging--the waits can be hours!  And it is always a gamble who will actually cut your hair.  The casual approach made a lot more sense when they had a small room with a couple of chairs; a little organization would be nice at this point.  Still, reliable for simple haircuts, if you can afford to set aside an afternoon for the wait!</review>

<text>Not that they need more patronage, as others have mentioned, the waits here can get out of control. But I wanted to throw my two cents here since I've had consistently good experiences and good haircuts here.

My hair is kind of hard to cut. It's curly with a few cowlicks and before I started going to Temescal Alley, it was kinda 50/50 whether I'd like my haircut--regardless of how much I paid.

But then I tried Temescal Alley and I haven't gone anywhere else since.

I've been going here since it was just Nick and Brad in a tiny room with two chairs. As they expanded I was a bit worried that new barbers would mean more variance in my haircuts but I've never gotten a bad haircut here. Which is crazy to me because I've had my hair cut by maybe ten different people there and every time it's good. Sometimes I like my cut more or less but it's always baseline of good.

The barbers are all good natured, nice folks. Their banter and cross talk is usually amusing. And as for the wait--its highly variable. Sometimes there's no wait at all. Other times you come in and the waitlist is full for the entire day.

If you like the barbers but need a scheduled appointment, try Al's Barbershop in Alameda. It's the same folks but appointment-only.</text>< Pictures>

This is nothing close to a flat top. And there’s a big gouge taken out of one side. The guy spent the whole time on the fade. I would not recommend this place to anyone. If this is a flat top to this guy. He should go back to barber school or maybe watch YouTube or something.<//text>

I mainly have a problem with the haircut I got and how it looks nothing like what I showed in the pictures of what I wanted. I ended up with a military style haircut without asking for one. The fade isn’t even close to what I showed in the picture, as I mentioned, my barber was nice, therefore he asked if it looked fine but seeing how short my hair was on the top there was no way I could go shorter on the sides and actually match what I showed from a beginning. The top is crazy short compared to what I wanted. Came to this place because everyone there is friendly and seems to be on top of current trends with hairstyles so it’s very disappointing that showing pictures of what I wanted done didn’t help at all.< /text>< gmap_id>

The chalkboard line system isolates people with limited time as a resource. They have great barbers and do fantastic work, but chalkboard caters to those who have time to wait. If your life demands more hours than others, then you can’t afford to wait to get your hair cut here. This feels very isolating to the blue collar, hourly workers who also want to spend money on a good quality haircut.</Review>

<Text>Best haircut on the East Bay! Unfortunately, they have no mechanism for making appointments... Not even a phone. You have to show up, put your name on the list, and wait a while (usually for hours as they are pretty popular). But I deal with it because the haircuts are such high quality.< /Text><time>1536436580305<//time><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I tend to be very particular about my haircuts. The two times I've been here I've been very happy with the cuts and staff. They are very friendly and great at what they do.

<Review>Just transferred to the area and heard great things about this place. I was lucky enough to get Adam to cut my hair. Great experience. I relocate a lot and finding a great barber is always tough. Adam was professional and gave me great tips. Very friendly and was able to correct what a precious barber butchered. I highly recommend this place and staff. While I was waiting I didn't see one bad haircut. Info highly recommend Adam. Professional and talented. He will he the only barber I use whole I'm in Oakland.<//Review></record>

Absolutely the BEST barber shop around!  All the people that work there are all extremely friendly and the environment is unparalleled!  It's almost like walking back in time a bit to the old school style barber shops.  I feel like I'm not only paying for an awesome haircut but also for an experience just going there!  Get there early though there is always a lineup!<//review>

<time>1529194670876< /time><Rating>1</Rating><review>I’ve got to say that with all of these reviews, I came in with high hopes. All I can say now is that this experience was incredibly underwhelming. There is no attention to detail here.

My usual barbers back home in NY take their time to give you a very sharp, fantastic haircut. Here, I come in and I’m out in less than 20 minutes. And the difference is apparent. The barber I had mentioned twice that he couldn’t do something that my previous barbers could do no problem. That’s pretty sad considering that I thought that it’s pretty common practice to give people a lineup.

If you don’t care about getting a really good haircut, come here. It’ll come out mediocre. Not worth $40, which is double what I pay in NY. Why should I pay double for half the service?

Maybe it was just the barber I had, but I don’t think I want to come back here only to be disappointed.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80857de10df3228f:0xb379deb270d4a6ae< /gmapID></record>

Stellar spot. I've been multiple times and each haircut has been done by a different person. And each time they cut it exactly how I want it, even when I have had a hard time explaining what I want. I have now moved but still make the drive because of the quality experience.< /review>

<review>I like this spot. Two of us have gone a number of times now and like each barber and each haircut. It feels like the whole crew cut similarly, probably all trained in house in addition to the normal training. Which ya' know, is rad. Nice group, very friendly crew of employees as well. Everyone's happy and enjoys what they do.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Been coming here for almost two years now and refuse to go anywhere else. These guys and gals know how to give a great haircut/beard trim. First come first serve and each barber has their own style, yet I've never left unsatisfied despite the occasional +hour wait. Relaxed atmosphere with hilarious banter. If you appreciate a great trim you owe it to yourself to visit Temescal Alley Barber Shop.< /Review>

I came in and was greeted and put my name on the chalkboard and was given a 90min wait time. Of course I wish it was shorter but I was prepared as there is plenty to occupy your time nearby, like a afternoon glass of wine with my wife at Dona Tomas at the end of the alley. I came back about 75mins later to wait outside the shop, shortly after a barber came outside and called my name. I walked in and greeted Joe. He asked me what I would like to do, I wanted to change up my hairstyle a bit but wanted to be able to default back to slicking back my hair if I didn't feel I could pull off the part. Joe was great in accessing my needs, he pulled off a excellent fade and cut and I'm very happy with the new style. He used a clay that he recommended for my hair type and so I purchased that also after my haircut. I would recommend this place and I will be back to see Joe in 3-4 weeks.</Review>< Pics>

Nice place, just your classic haicut, no fancy styling. You get there and they tell you how long the expected wait time is, so you can just leave and come back. If you decide to stay, maybe you're lucky and it's your turn earlier if the people before you on the wait list don't show up.<//Text>

The prices are a little high (although not abnormal for the Bay Area) and the wait can be long. However, it is usually worth it. The Barbers are very knowledgeable and work with you to get the look your'e after. They are also great at giving you a truly individual cut to match you / your style. Plus there are plenty of great places to grab a bite to eat while you wait!< /review></record></dataset><record>

And on top of that I got a sipper of bourbon.  I don't remember the guys name that cut my hair but he is first chair on left when you walk in. He was from Santa Cruz and just moved to Berkley.

After waiting a half hour, I was ready and the stylist didn't introduce himself. Very cut and dry. No personality which made everything uncomfortable.

I was weary of his intentions and I was right. The dude was very smug and into himself. Terrible. I received a glorified bowl cut. Coming from Detroit and only having one cut since then, I am extremely disappointed. Never again</review>< pics>

<text>The guy at the door is friendly but their lack of a reservation system means you get matched with a different barber every time.

Last time I was matched with Brad. As I showed him photos of the haircut I usually get, he was visibly annoyed. When I showed a second photo to help describe a previous haircut that I didn't like as much, he was even more annoyed.

He then proceeded to tell me what "I liked", which contradicted the conversation we had just had. He proceeded by giving me an army cut (and no Brad I do not like army cuts) without saying a single word to me. Once finished, he pretty much pushed me out of the chair without showing me the back of my head.

Not sure if he was having a bad day or if they were so busy that he was trying to makeup time on my cut but the outcome was an uneven cut far from the style requested.

Can't recommend it.< /text>< pics>

An Old School 'shave and a haircut' vibe comes over you walking into this place.
Classy barbers chopping away, talking among one another on proper barber industry etiquette.

Exactly what you want from barber shop, with complimentary whiskey amenities.

This is the only place I trust in the Bay Area.

Always full of people for a reason, but next time I go want to get the bald guy to cut my hair. Last time I went in I had a part in my hair, after that trip it's too short to part till it grows out again lol. But still doesn't look bad! So 5 stars and I'll be back, and maybe more instructive to the barber too. :-)</text>

I've gone to Temescal Alley Barber Shop two times so far and without a doubt I'll travel miles just to get a quality haircut from these guys. They're on the level with you, give you a snappy looking cut, and are wicked friendly. Need a professional cut? Check these guys out. Definitely worth the price versus a $12 chop shop.<//Text>

<review>While slightly more than most hair cuts in the area, and not having reservations, Temescal Alley rarely disappoints on the final product. Many of their barbers are experienced and capable. It is all cash, so please think about getting money out for your cut and tip in advance.< /review>< Pics>

Absolutely fantastic cut and the most enjoyable banter I've had-- I learned how to make a racer back t-shirt! (Thanks, Lauren!). The shop is parked right next to Cro Coffee and Curbside ice cream, so there is plenty to entertain yourself with while you wait. Will definitely be back.< /Review>

There's an epic power struggle happening in Temescal between these guys, the pickling store and Standard and Strange men's outfitters for the 'most hipster of them all' title. They know what they're doing and they get the job done though. If I ever figure out how to get offered any of that whiskey they keep on display I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars
UPDATE: I got offered some of that whiskey</Review>

Always feel good when I leave here with a new great haircut, but go expecting to put your name down and come back in an hour or two.</Review>

Excellent haircuts.  You can get a straight-edge shave as well. Wait is long (1-2 hours)</Review>

This is worth the hype and the wait for a superior cut at a great price. I would highly recommend this if you don't know exactly what you want or what would look right for you.< /Text>

Best barbers around and I've tried several in SF and Oakland. It's also the most charming and humble barber shops I've been too.< /Review>

Came here for the first time not too long ago. I really liked my haircut, but like others have probably mention the wait here is INSANE. I came and hour before the shop opened and still had to wait 45 minutes to hour. Thankfully there's Cro next door, where you can grab a coffee and pastry as you wait. The guys here are as hipster as hipster get but they know what they are doing. They are no frills and get right down to business. I'm use to going to salons and having long conversations with the stylist but not here. You'll come in, get your hair cut, and leave. I don't think I would come any later than right when they open, however these guys give a good haircut.< /text>

Been frequenting the place now for a year. Experienced, professional, friendly staff. Do be prepared to wait, it is first come first served. There's plenty to check out in the alley and places to sit and read, etc. Lots of Gather employees get their hairs cut here.</Text>

Had a lovely experience visiting recently.  Found a handbag that had all the features I wanted at 70% off and a dress for my daughter.  They didn't have her size on the rack but the sales gal offered to go to the back to check and brought one out really quickly. Store is really put together nicely too.<//Text>

<text>If you're looking for a purse for your girl you've come to the right area as this has a ton of them at excellent prices. The sales person is also willing to assist you with your needs if you know nothing about women's hand bags. The colors and Ambience of the store are also very appealing.</text>< Pictures>

Came in enthusiastic but the welcoming and customer service was very disappointing. Hoping to buy a handbag but after spending almost 30 min. And getting no help from two sales associates that will only welcome other people made the shopping experience completely a bad turnout.<//text>

< review>
I needed a trailer to haul my golf cart behind my motorhome. I looked at several different options and almost bought a swivel tote trailer but then  saw the Kendon Trailer website and stand up utility trailers.  After further research and comparisons, I decided on the Kendon Stand up Utility Trailer.

I called, spoke to Javier and placed an order for one. Took a couple of months to get, and a little pricey, but it is well worth the wait and and money spent.  It is  a beautiful very high quality and sturdy  trailer. It is somewhat heavy and I need help standing it up, but it is nice that I can store it inside my garage up against the wall. Everywhere I take it, I get many compliments and inquiry's about it. I have been very pleased with my trailer and customer service from Kendon Trailers! I highly recommend their trailers and lifts!<//review>

<review>Love the trailer.  It is easy to store, load and pull.  I use it for both my BMW K1600GT when I travel and when I pull my BMW S1000RR to the track<//review>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I’m selling my 2012 Kendon Dual SLR after 10 years because I’m no longer traveling with my bike. This is my second Kendon trailer. Both have performed exceptionally well - I could never tell it was behind me and handling was awesome when in the rain. My only complaints are lack of adequate rear tie down for rear tires and floor boards on the Harley Ultra kept taking out a tail light when not being careful during loading.

<Name>Gary Kraun< /Name><time>1608234064161< /time><rating>5</rating><Text>After weeks of trying to educate myself on motorcycle tow trailers I decided to go with the Kendo Go Series ride on trailer. Towing a 30k Harley had me a bit intimidated to say the least. Can I tow will the Subaru, can I hookup the electric, did I get the proper tow bar, can I ride up and back out myself. Just a few of the questions whirling in my head. I spoke with Javier more than a few times as well as emailed. Straight up professional every time. Even with some of my maybe more common sense questions. I have no hesitation recommending Kendon. You can see how easily it fits in my garage.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe4R6FSabXUu8z6wXI_JFrWB4J0YcXOkK3TBIC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

I like this trailer a lot,  but I had to spend another $1k to have a fabricator add on things that it should have came with from the factory. It should have come with a way to store fuel for the dirt bikes and it also needed additional tie down points in the rear of the trailer to tie down the rear tires on each dirt bike. These are pretty basic things that were missing. The trailer itself is well built, tows well, and is easy to use.< /Review>

<review>Great trailer that can hold 1 double up 4 wheeler or  2 single seat 4 wheeler.
Trailer looks great and cargo rides smooth.
I've had it for 4 months now and have been very happy. Folds up nicely in my garage and takes up minimal space.
If you can afford it, get it.< /review>< Pictures>

The trailer arrived nicely packed.  Build quality looks solid and the setup was straightforward.   The instruction manual is a bit under-developed but it's not hard to find answers online.    Great choice for a suburban garage without a lot of space.< /Text>

Updating because they called back and will have the trailer to me just in time.  Will update again once it is here.  Broken promises are bad, but going the extra mile to keep a promise is great.

"I ordered a trailer eight weeks before I needed it.  They told me it would be six weeks, so I asked if I could count on it being here in time.  "Oh yeah, no problem!" they said.  At that time there was a used trailer locally that would have suited my needs which I would have purchased had they not told me it would be here in time.  Do you think it made it in time?  Of course not, and they weren't willing to expedite shipping to get it here.  Hotels booked, time taken off, motorcycles ready - but not trailer.  Of course they blame COVID - but COVID is why it was going to take six weeks.
I know they have great trailers, but unkept promises are the worst thing a business can do."<//review>

I just used my trailer for the 1st time so I can't say whether or not it will stand the test of durability over time but what I can say is that so far my experience has been positive.  This week I pulled a couple of KTM 500s from Rock Hill, SC to Colorado Springs, CO using one of the special edition orange and black stand-up trailers (I did mention the bikes are KTMs hence the decision) and the little trailer performed great.  When I got there my son helped me fold it up and stick it in the back of his single garage.  The trailer and the two bikes take up about 10 ft of his single garage leaving plenty of room for other gear.</Text>

Purchased a single standup ride-on trailer this summer (2018), new from the factory ("deluxe" model). Quick shipping, great experience with the company. Not inexpensive, but it works and works well. I've towed about 1000 miles so far with bikes ranging from a 500-pound sport bike to 850-pound cruiser. Easy to load/unload, smooth trailering, easy to store. Recommended.< /Review>

Awesome trailer to tow my bike and a great company to deal with. I purchased my single bike walk-up trailer directly from Kendon after stopping by their factory to view them. It took about an hour to complete the paperwork and have the trailer go through final assembly, hook up to my truck and head home.

Quality of the trailer is outstanding and I would highly recommend Kendon if you want a very well constructed trailer!<//review>

Excellent trailer; best in class. This is the second Kendon I have owned.

A couple suggestions for the Kendon design team to consider for future refinements (which would kick my rating to a 5):
1. The factory added a third rail to my Kendon dirt bike stand-up and found that the bolts used on the new rail were different than the other two; requiring a different wrench (Std vs metric) to adjust the wheel chock.
2. A custom expensive tongue stand is required on the new trailer design. Suggest going back to the inexpensive leveler design and providing a simple mounting plate so the trailer is not scratched up. I added a rubber door stop to the main frame to prevent scratches and rust.
3.  The lugs to remove the spare tire are a different size than the lugs to remove a tire! This is very odd; should be the same size.
4. The spare tire ground clearance is horrible; tire easily bottoms out on the road. Suggest providing mounts on the top side of the deck. This is better than designing the trailer for an underside mount which could damage the tire.

Even with these flaws, still best in class.</text>

<text>I ordered a single standup trailer during Kendon's Black Friday promotion this past fall (2017). Communication with Kendon was great and they even offered me a two-tone paint scheme at no extra charge. Generally the trailer I received was very well constructed, but I do have some criticisms and that's why I'm only giving them 4 stars. The problems I have with my trailer are as follow:

1) Kendon's standard trailers come with incandescent tail/turn/break lights. In this day and age, and especially at this price point, LEDs should be standard.  There's really no excuse for this and I replaced the lights immediately.

2) A full-size spare tire (exact size as tires on the trailer) will not fit where the spare tire bracket is welded to the underside of the trailer because the frame tubes on either side are too close together. Now I was probably going to carry the spare in the back of my truck anyway, but the option would be nice and why weld something on that can't be used?

3) The wheel chock is not very effective.  I have a Condor chock that holds either of my bikes upright very well, but the chock on the Kendon trailer can't be trusted to hold my 2015 Kawasaki Versys for even a moment while I tie it down.  The bike has to rest on its kickstand otherwise it will fall over.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Condor chock but I think Kendon could learn something from Condor's design.

4) Don't expect to stand the trailer up and roll it into a standard height garage, it's too tall. You have to push the trailer inside clear of the door frame and then lift it upright where you have more clearance.  I don't think this is a design flaw, but Kendon should make this clear as some might expect that you could stand it up in your driveway and just push it in. Obviously if you have an RV door there's no problem.

These trailers are good, but they could be great with a couple of tweaks.  For what I paid, I expected great.<//text>< resp>

<review>I bought a very USED 2003 dual stand up trailer that needed a thorough cleaning/polishing and touch up. I was impressed with the entire structural integrity despite 15 years of regular use. There was not one structural or weld issue. After cleaning it up, I contacted Kendon for the finishing touch, replacing the original stickers and a few plastic plugs. They we’re especially helpful and the finished trailer now looks like new from 10 feet away. Used it for the 1st time this weekend to pick up a full dresser Harley Ultra Classic and the trailer performed like brand new on the 700 mile round trip ! Very impressed with the trailer AND Customer Service from Kendon.<//review><time>1532538949934<//time><userid>115413423432034250642< /userid>< response>

I absolutely love the dual motorcycle, ride-on trailer.  The trailer is light weight but very sturdy and stable.  The fold-up and stand-up features are great for winter storage.  The trailer tows with no effort and you can forget it is there.  There are also many tie-down points making the trailer useful for a wide range of bikes.  The ramp is a bit heavy but that is necessary for larger bikes.  I use a separate aluminum ramp for the two dirt bikes and two dual sports.  I use the Kendon ramp for our larger cruisers.  Additionally, customer service has been top notch and there have been no issues with the warranty.  Great product, great company, great people.</Text>

Buying new trailer via phone using the website product info convenient and budget friendly v. shopping minimal inventory at local dealers.  Repeat customer.  New ride-on model design reduces the labor and potential risk of the earlier model.  Well engineered, road tough and garage friendly design. Good reputation equals low depreciation.< /Review>

<Text>I purchase a used single load Kendon trailer from a private party 3 years ago.

I called the dealership and explained to them I purchased  a used trailer and had some questions.   They welcomed me aboard and have taken care of me for the last 3 years.

I have towed the trailer 7,000 miles with a Harley Davidson FXRS and no problems.  The tow is smooth and you forget your towing.

Great trailer and easy to store.<//Text>< Pictures>

The trailer arrived well packaged and had no damage.  The  trailer assembly was straight forward with no issues.  Removing all the packing material took longer than assembling the trailer.  I'm impressed with the trailer design and quality.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dcd6c9418302c7:0xd9f5d38c9b538123<//gmapID></record>

<Review>Great motorcycle trailer! We recently bought the Kendon stand-up trailer for two bikes. We got the ride-up version, so it's easy to get the bikes up. I can do it alone but I wouldn't recommend it, a second person is always helpful to avoid falls.

The trailer rides like a charm. We did a 3,500 miles trip this summer with 2 bikes on it. No problem at all doing 70 mph with an SUV, the Kendon is super stable and light compared to other trailers.

Great product!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Name>Robert Smith<//Name><text>Kendon staff was very accommodating and friendly.  Trailer has been great so far as I've only used it twice to the race track.  Upgraded wheels look really good!   Trailer is easy to use and pretty straight forward.  I gained approx. 4 mpg over the U-Haul motorcycle trailer I was renting!  My only wish is there was some type of rack to store items i.e. gas, tools etc. on the front.  Overall I'm very happy with the trailer.<//text></record>

The whole process was great.  They kept in touch with me during the building process and shipping was smooth.  Set up was a bit tricky (mainly because 3 old guys tried to do it).  Standing it on it's end as advertised is a challenge,  This suckers heavy.  But we removed the ramps and hitch (easy) and we could manage it.  Build out was amazing.  It's a very well built.  The guys that helped me put it together were airline mechanics and they were impressed.  The only reason I didn't give this trailer 5 stars is because it is very hard to stand up on it's end for storage, but that being said it has to be strong (heavy) to hold the weight of a 1200 pound trike.< /Review>

Good customer service experience recently calling in to order some parts to overhaul my 2004 trailer from Kendon. They were very helpful with good prices getting me the parts to keep using my aging trailer running. Its a great product they have, I needed/wanted aluminum panels replaced< /review>

<review>First, I decided to Google search for folding motorcycle trailer models. Although, more expensive, the Kendon Dual ride up trailer appeared to be the best design. Next step was to see the actual trailer in use at a motorcycle ride event. Convinced by what I observed, you can very easily ride on and off the trailer without assistance, I called Kendon directly. The Kendon representative, Elliott, arranged for my purchase of a demo Dual Ride up trailer. It was delivered to a freight terminal on a short of pallet. With the assistance of a fellow biker, we unwrapped the packing materials, had the wheels on and attached to my car in about 30 minutes. The demo trailer had four spots where the paint was rubbed off. Some gloss black spray paint fixed it up and it now looks perfect. The only issue I can find in the trailer model is that the tongue shape really required the Kendon detachable trailer jack. No other type of jack will fit correctly. The Kendon jack is overpriced but, necessary.</review>< username>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Customer service goes out of their way to keep me informed.  Don't just order online.  Call them up and order with a human.  The two week lead time did not include the transportation; that was another week.  They sent the truck details so I was able to follow the shipment all the way to Florida.  The upgrade to a 2006 dual trailer to enable  the ride-on feature was worth every penny.   I just wish I didn't end up with a bunch of scrap steel from the old trailer.< /review>< pictures>

Excellent customer service and a great product. They guided me on what I needed to get my used Kendon 2 bike trailer up to speed. They did not over sell me on anything and all my parts arrived quickly. My 2005 Fat Boy CVO and my wife's 2003 V-Rod are in good hands with these guys.< /review>

I can’t say enough about the Kendon one-up trailer I have now and the two-up I used to have. They were so solid and went down the road so steady even at 80-90MPH.

Recently, I drove to Daytona Bike weeks and on the way, lost two of the bolts that hold the ramps on.
Monday morning I called Kendon and they shipped them out that day and I had them on Wednesday.

Great products, great customer support-how rare is that, these day?</Text>

The concept of a folding motorcycle trailer (in my case a trike trailer)  is excellent.  It works well for the cramped garage space that I store it in.  I think the finished product is lacking in 2 important details however: (1) there are no owners manual directions on how to properly store the ramps under the trailer when it is in use.  When I did call the Company, the suggested storage solution and the company supplied pins to do so were not very satisfactory; and (2) the trailer rides too low and the suspension setup that the trailer comes with (torsion bar) is not ride height adjustable like Chrysler Corporation models up to the '90's that used the same system were.  It is very easy to scrape the trailer bottom when going into a driveway or driving on a gravel/dirt road that has a high center.  I really liked the salesperson that helped me (both pre and post sale), though.< /Review>

In regards to your two details: (1) We have a detailed Owner's Manual with pictures that describes in detail how to use the trike trailer and store the ramps.  I'm sorry the customer service rep you spoke with did not send that to you.  We emailed it to you now.  (2) The torsion axles we use are manufactured by one of the largest torsion bar manufacturers in USA, Dexter Axle.  We are not aware of an adjustable system from them but we will reach out to see what options they have available as they are constantly developing new and improved torsion bar axles.  Thanks again for the feedback!"}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The fold-up trailer I got through Kendon is a must have for me. I have limited space in the garage to fit a trailer. To make matters worse, I drive a Kia Soul which is not rated to tow much tongue-weight at all. After doing extensive research, their trailer was the only solution I could find since the tongue weight is so light. One person alone can move these around without much trouble. Trailer tows great behind my car. I found their customer service to be top-notch as well, really nice people. Would buy again!< /Text>

<Text>I needed wheel bearings and seals. Folks at Kendon were very nice, prices were fair, and shipping was quick.  Only minor issue was that I requested all bearings (4 needed for 2 wheels), but I only received 2. However, I will check with Kendon separately on this and expect that they will take care of me, as usual.  I really love their service!< /Text>< date>

<Text>This was the best experience I have had ordering something on line. I was involved since the beginning when Kendon started the build of the trike trailer. I had a lot of questions and concerns after it became available for purchase.  Steven made sure they were all answered. He even went back and got a can am spyder that matched what I am driving to take pictures of how it can be tied down. Richard was awesome on keeping me informed on the build and delivery of the trailer. He sent me pictures of the trailer and keep me posted of the progress. I was very anxious about the purchase but Richard was very nice and was patient with me. I am truly very happy with the purchase and the quality of trailer and the great people I worked with on this.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Tows easy behind my Volvo Station wagon but even better now with my mid sized SUV. Under mounted spare tire has taken a bump or 2 or speed bumps but not damaged it. I used a harbor freight ATV ramp instead of that stupid little ramp they give you. They now charge 899 for the wider ramp. Yes, the Kendon is expensive but it's well built and will last a long time.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcd6c9418302c7:0xd9f5d38c9b538123< /gmapID></record>

<review>After a very long search on the internet I decided to purchase a double Kenton trailer because it was inexpensive to haul and it took little space to store. It is always stored in our garage. After the fist few trips we noticed the powder coating on the fenders was starting to bubble. Contacted our seller without any luck of receiving some sort of customer service. I then contacted Kenton, to my surprise I didn't receive a response from them, after numerous weeks,  calls,  emails and forwarding pictures of the fenders,  I was told to contact the seller in Kitchener, On. It took many phone calls from me, and finally he agreed to order new fenders. This turned out to be a 9 month ordeal!   ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!! Recently we noticed the black powder coating is flaking off everywhere on the trailer. It looks like junk!! So disappointed in the quality control. Would not waste my money on this trailer again!!!</review><Resp>None< /Resp><Date>1510877909267</Date></record>

Not only does it pull perfectly without even one wiggle - it amazingly folds up and stands up to very compact storage when not in use.  The only Smart Car Trailer to buy by far!!!

Highly recommend Kendon Trailers mainly because of the quality of their product. Purchased their new trailer designed for the HD Trike due their the low weight and quality of the trailer. Thus far I am completely satisfied with my decision. The company is very customer friendly and helped me along the way.<//Text>

I bought a new Kendon combo trailer in April ’12 and have put lots of miles on it trailering my bikes to racetracks and other places. Very happy with the trailer and build quality. I lost my standard loading ramp last month. I checked on Kendon website and found that they have introduced a new “deluxe” loading ramp, which is a “better” version of the standard loading ramp. Per the description, the best part was that it was designed to be compatible with all 2003 (and newer) trailers. I promptly ordered it from my local dealer. The ramp arrived; it had excellent build quality and worked well loading the bike.Now the bad part – Per Kendon, the deluxe ramp stores underneath the rear section of the trailer in the same place as the standard loading ramp. This is NOT true. The ramp does not fit under my trailer. I contacted Kendon customer support and explained them the issue. They asked me to email them some photos, which I did the same day. Waited for 5 days…no reply. So I called them again and the customer support rep told me that he will talk to the engineer about the issue. Three days later got an email – “We have confirmed that the ramp is not compatible with the combo trailer. Your best solution is to store the ramp in the car”. Is that the best they could do?!! I paid extra for their high-quality trailer and their “high quality deluxe ramp”…and they tell me that I have to store the ramp in the car?!! My car does not have space for the ramp and there is no way I am putting the ramp on the trailer and securing it with tie downs! Since it is their fault, I replied them back saying that they should exchange the ramp with a standard ramp and refund me the difference. Guess what….no reply from them since 3 weeks! The description on the website still says that the ramp is compatible with all trailers.  Buyers beware…do not buy this ramp! If a company can’t stand by their product, then I don’t want to deal with them. I am looking to buy aluminum wheels and radial tires for my trailer and I am definitely not gonna buy the ones that Kendon sells. Who knows…they may not fit either!

Update 1/23/13: Kendon acknowledged their mistake that their product had fitment issues. They exchanged the ramp and processed the refund for me for the different in cost.< /Text>

Bought the StandUp single bike trailer and couldn't be happier.  Outstanding workmanship, high-quality components, and drop-dead gorgeous black-and-red paint.  It was more expensive than other trailers but it's quality through-and-through.<//Review>

<Text>If I could give them less than one star I would! I bought a Kendon standup signal rail trailer because I was told they were very good. So I put my 2016 Harley Limited low on it and I could not get it out of the wheel chock with out a push from somebody. The trailer is labeled a "big bike transport". When I contacted Kendon they told me the trailer was made in 2003 they said that bikes back then did not weigh 800+lbs. I had a 2001 ultra classic that weighed well over 800lbs. Obviously the people at Kendon and their engineers have no clue what they are doing.< /Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1534175905487, 'text': "Stephen, we're very sorry you are disappointed in the 2003 Kendon trailer you purchased.  As explained to you via email, 15 years ago the trailers were set up to handle bikes of that current time and most customers did not have issues loading/unloading their bikes, whether they were 200 lbs. or 800+ lbs.  Over the last 27 years, as most products, Kendon trailers have evolved and there have been numerous changes to wheel chocks, rails, loading ramps, and other components to accommodate various styles of motorcycles, current and past.  We offered you an upgrade to our latest low profile wheel chock via email, but you never responded to us."}</response>

I only bought a lock from them. BUT... it was for a double bike trailer that I bought second hand. The trailer, which is their MAIN export (also lifts and such) was in super shape, something you can expect because of the huge attention to making an absolute bombproof product. Did I say that it is beautiful as well...<//review>

<text>I just recieved the lift on Monday. I have not had a chance to use it, but it is very well made. It also ships in a way that there is no damage. It is a little heaver then I though,but it is very easy to move around and stand up. I like it a lot< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Converting my stand up trailer to a ride up trailer was easier than loading the bike on the older trailer.  Took me a few hours in the heat, but was as simple as the instructions illustrated.</Review>

I am very please with my recent purchase of a Kendon 2 bike ride up trailer. Making the purchase was made very easy by the sales rep Ryan who explained everything and made suggestions to make everything go well. The unit was delivered without issue, and everything went together just as I saw on one of their YouTube videos. I look forward to taking it on an upcoming two week trip with two HD's loaded.<//Text>

I was the winner of the 25th Anniversary Logo contest. I won the BB107 Single Bike Trailer which was quite a coincidence because I had just sold my 2 bike SRL trailer with plans to buy a Single Bike Trailer. Working with Steven Adams from Kendon Trailers, I arranged to upgrade the trailer I had won to the one I really wanted, the BB107RULE (Limited Edition) by paying the difference of the two trailers (plus I bought a couple of extras). Since the factory was only 300 miles away from me I decided to drive down to LA and pick it up. The only complication was the fact that they are only open during the week so it made scheduling the trip a little more difficult. With Steven's help we coordinated the pick-up for May 13th and I was there at 9am to pick it up. I had the twin utility boxes mounted on the trailer by the guy's at Kendon and when Steven took me back to the area where the trailers are built and I got my first look at my trailer I was totally stunned at how beautiful it was (pictures do not do it justice). The bright orange frame with gloss black rails, fenders, and boxes and the polished diamond plate flooring and lid's of the utility boxes made it look like a true work of art. I made a couple of stops on my way home that day and someone would always come up to me asking what that was behind my car. All n all it was a great experience working with the guy's and girl who work at Kendon Trailers (I'm sorry, I forgot the dog also) and although I have not towed my bike anywhere on the trailer yet I look forward to doing so. The down side is like buying a new car. You dread that first scratch or mud puddle you have to drive through but it is inevitable. Thank you so much Steven and Kendon Trailers for a job well done.< /text>

<Text>I've had my 2-Up bike trailer for maybe 14 years now. Lots of days and thousands of miles of trailing with 2 or 1 bike. Or one rail moved (and braced) into a center position.
All and all a great trailer. It's too heavy now for my old body to stand up with spare attached below. I may switch to a single.

Though the trailer's low profile is great, I've never been jazzed about the narrow 4-tube loading ramp. It can be spooky loading a full dress bike w/no where to put one foot down (depending on right or left side) as you motor up.

I attached traction adhesive to the center 2 tubes. Loading in the rain can be squirrelly.  I do a 4 point tie-down but occasional a bike's back end shifts across the slick sheet metal.
The stand-up wheel castors have been near terrible. Not heavy duty enough for me. Only good on the hardest-smoothest of surfaces. I have replaced them twice over the years and they are broken again.

I have had to have 3 deck support brackets re-welded under the plating. Too many pot holes and thousands of miles of abuse.

Florida State Trooper - "mistakenly" told me the safety cable MUST be a chain not a wire cable. And she won't let me drive off.   _itch.

All and all probably the best open bike trailer out there... imo</Text>< Response>

I researched many trailers and decided to go with a Kendon standup dual ride up trailer, limited addition orange. I worked with Rich at Kendon and he did a great job answering all my questions, of which I had many, and guiding me through the process of purchasing and shipping it as I live way up on the coast of Northern CA. I was worried about how it would get here and what it would look like when received. It got here within a week and was wrapped very well and dropped of by a local shipping company with no damage to it at all. The instructions to assemble it were easy and if we had questions we just called Rich or watched the Kendon UTube videos. We did not receive some of the items listed with the limited addition and called Rich who researched it and got back to us right away explaining they were back ordered and he would ensure that we got them ASAP when available.  Rich also helped us figure out the steps to register it as anything involving DMV in CA is a confusing, frustrating time consuming process. The trailer is well made and should haul our Yamaha 200 and NX700 safely and easily!<//Text>

<text>Great trailer, agree with everyone, except... with Yamaha Royal Star Venture motorcycle used trailer twice:
1) Tie down rings located on axle has wiring for lights going through it.  On most bikes it may be O.K. but with an RSV, or HD (length) it's DANGEROUS - strap hook almost cut through wiring.  Sent email - told to use soft strap to get behind wiring.  No response on alternate design recommendation.

2) On a 600-mile trip had spare tire fell off while on a I-10 Mississippi Bridge - no pull-over lane, couldn't stop, spare caught under trailer caused serious damage to frame.  Checked spare tire about halfway point, seemed O.K.  Realized bumpy roads in MS and LA shook things loose - FAST.  Didn't realize danger until too late.  After $300 repairs drilled hole through spare tire lug-bolts and installed two I/4" linch pins with self-locking ring to prevent lug-nuts from completely slipping off.  Sent email to Kendon, not looking for remedy but to inform of danger and recommend solution - no response.

I would recommend this trailer to anyone - after rewiring the lights to avoid the axle tie-down ring and drilling holes through spare tire lug-bolts and installing a linch pin.</text>< date>

This place dissapoints. The refrigeration is not at an adecute temperature proof of this is that I saw more than one deli meat package with mold. The bananas, swweet potatoes and spinach were black with white/green mold. I would not return to this store and I do not recommend this store to other shoppers.<//Text>

<review>Smart & Final. It is what it is. They're not Gelsons, and they're also not trying to be. Good place for a quick run in and out for that one specific item you know they have (real specific, because they'll likely only have one version of the item you're looking for or none at all.)< /review><Date>1502230279871<//Date>< Rating>

The guy that works there is always chill and talks well with my wife and I. Tonight. Just before closing time He ran back to stock and brought us out some turkeys cause the ones in the freezer were small and we wanted bigger ones. Thank you.</review>

These guys know what they are doing! I brought my Jeep Renegade in for a lift and new tires, and they sat there with me researching for over 2 hours on how to make it work so I can get the setup I want on my little rig! Mingo went above and beyond to ensure that I am absolutely satisfied, he even adjusted some stuff at no charge when I came back just to ensure that I was happy with the way my Jeep rides! Honestly, these guys are worth the money, they will go above and beyond to make sure you are 100% satisfied, they have insane knowledge, and are honest people (that last one is the most important part!). The quality of service I received here is what will keep me coming back for any future mods!<//review>

<userid>110811212532036302637< /userid><review>I advise against purchasing anything from this company unless you are interested in terrible product development, awful customer relations, and the worst communications. Cali Raised Off Road is entirely unprofessional and can't seem to engineer parts to save themselves. Long story short, we ordered a bed rack system off their website, and ordered the associated parts that were advertised on their website to work with their system. The parts manufactured by Cali Raised were not compatible, and we have gone through multiple renditions with the Cali Raised product and sales teams. We have wasted hours of our time trying to get functioning products via repeated attempts to reach via email and phone. We have had to cancel trips because of the deficiencies of Cali Raised products and the company. 7 months later we are still waiting on a solution from Cali Raised. Would give zero stars if possible.< /review></record>

Always a helpful hand at Cali raised off-road. Didn’t know exactly what I wanted at first but Morgan guided me the whole way to get me in to the setup I needed/wanted. I still go to him 3 years later for advice.< /Text>

Great products! I got some sliders for my tundra which are high quality and fit great.  The reason i took off a star was because i had to go back a second time since when I first went to pick them up, there was alot of damage on the rhino lining that i got on the sliders.  This isnt necessarily their fault, but I feel like they should have inspected the product when they got it back from coating and had them redo it.  I noticed the damage when i was loading them onto my truck.  It was a hassle going back a second time and waiting another 2 weeks.  They did offer to deliver the parts to me when they came back but unfortunately, they could only deliver it during a weekday super late at night, which wasnt going to work for me.  All in all it took over 2 months to get them after i ordered it, but I am super happy with them now.  Morgan was great to deal with.<//text>

<review>Unfortunately my previous 5 star rating no longer applies. The 5 stars was actually my second update from my initial one star review. I have had to edit my review for this business 3 times now which is unprecedented for me.
So, I'll try and make the explanation of my experience as brief as possible.
To start. These guys do great work. They did an awesome job on my RAV4. I totally would use them again if it wasn't for one BIG issue. That issue being COMMUNICATION. I honestly can't think of anything more important when running a business. People have lives and schedules and this establishment lives in a world of one. They do not and will not pick up the phone, respond to an email or dare I say, give a callback. It's stressful and unnecessary to do that to a customer. Worst yet, when you do get ahold of someone they do not go above and beyond to help. I quote "yea, he's a busy guy" that's what I got. I have emailed the owner pleading for help and he doesn't even respond.
To me, these are huge red flags. And unless you are dropping some serious $$$$ here. You probably will be met with much of the same. I can attest to all of this because it took them 6 months to install a pair of fog lights and ditch lights. They look fantastic but I wouldn't do it again. There have got to be other similar business that would be happy to take in a customer.

If you decide to go with CaliRaised my advice is to brace yourself for the long haul.

God speed to you.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtMp-qcHmJYep2GeCkwvPMHi9SkddRAZe8CAqb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I recently had a great experience with Cali Raised Off-Road. I broke one of the Bilstein 5100s on my 4Runner. The shock is practically impossible to find right now. Called Cali Raised and they checked and verified they had a couple in stock. They were very nice. We completed a simple transaction that integrated the use of email and their online ordering system while I was on the phone. Had the shock in Utah and installed in three days. Great job Cali Raised!<//review><Time>1623991486082<//Time>< Name>

One thing to keep in mind if you're going to do business with this company. I SUGGEST YOU DONT!!!!!

I spent thousands here and their customer service is horrible.  Once they have your money they don't care about you.  They don't return phone calls. If you have an issue you're on your own.  I mean their prices are higher than most but they do have some cool stuff.   Again, their customer service is horrible.   Good luck<//Review>

Brought my truck here, after getting done from a shop in Pomona, found out that i was close to getting into an accident. They didnt tighten the screws and put the wrong springs.

These guys tool care of everything!
The owner and Jose took the time to explain everything.

Morgan was AWSOME too!

I am already taking my other Toyota so they may do all the suspension!

They email me
They call me before they do something they didnt mention.

These guys are really kool!< /Text>

First and foremost I'd like to thank the Cali Raised staff for being so helpful and professional. I myself work in the automotive industry and all to often I've dealt with vendors/installers who really don't give a sh*t after you hand over the money. The staff at Cali Raised has gone above and beyond the call of duty for me on multiple occasions to correct any issues I had with the items I've purchased from them. I especially like to thank Morgan who has taken the time out of his evenings to personally hand deliver parts that were missing from the boxes of parts I picked up. Morgan, twice now has made the 4 hour round trip to make sure I've had everything I need to finish the installs of the items I ordered. He's the real MVP and the dude deserves a raise for the efforts he put forth to maintain the excellent customer service Cali Raised provides. I will continue to purchase my offroad and overlanding equipment from them in the future. Morgan, Jake, Jessica, and John, thank you for everything, you guys provide a great product and excellent service!!!<//text>

Excellent customer service!  I called and spoke with JC, while many companies out there are pushing the customer to some online, phone labyrinth of "please press 1 for customer service", these guys just picked up the phone and talked me through what i needed and got me what I was looking for.  JC spent the time needed to make sure everything was done right, emailing me a written copy of part numbers, easy to pay, just click the link.  JC even sent me a photo of my purchase being picked up by UPS.  Thanks again JC for my new 2.5 Fox shocks and Element UCAs!</review>

<review>My experience was that it's a very unprofessional business. During my first visit I had to witness the manager berating one of the employees in front of all their employees and customers. It was very uncomfortable. So much so, my girlfriend nearly had an anxiety attack.

Yes, I got the items I ordered but, after spending $3,500 with them, you'd think they could throw in a free installation. Nope. They wanted an additional $300 to install a bolt on unit with a total of 20 bolts. A half hour job at best (I did it myself in 90 mins). Of course they had plenty of excuses as to why they need to charge including having to have the people set aside to do it. when I picked up the items half their staff was just goofing off.

To make things worse, they were so disorganized they couldn't remember which building they put my items in. They didn't even keep them together they're all in separate buildings. I was there for over an hour while they searched their buildings for my items.

My bottom line, if you can get your parts elsewhere do so.<//review>< userid>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Wow! I am beyond impressed. As an immigrant from Russia I must say - this is a real American business! Highly knowledgeable, down to earth crew who goes above and beyond for their customers. You definitely don't see a lot of that in SoCal. Almost everyone is out to rip you off because the demand is so high. But not the guys at Cali Raised Offroad.

I purchased their super awesome NSV knight rider LED bar for my Tundra. Shipping was fast. After I installed the bar myself, I started having a few electrical issues. I did everything correct and the product is great. The problem is Toyota likes to randomly change their wiring every year so the recent change wasn't working well with my new light bar.

I called up Cali Raised and they told me to bring it in. Even though they were an hour away, they were the only ones who said they can take care of the problem the same day. Other places wanted me to wait at least a week.

Morgan helped me out and he took care of all the issues in under an hour!! He repinned the headlight connectors and switched out the burned fuses. On top of that, Cali Raised didn't want to charge me anything since I bought the light from them.

During these tough times, I was not expecting such excellent service. A huge THANK YOU to Morgan and Cali Raised Offroad for helping me out. I will come to you with all of my off roading needs from now on.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
This shop was actually referred to me by a friend and I’m so happy I chose these guys to install my Prinsu rack, LED light bar, Baja Designs ditch lights and amber fog lights. Family owned and operated business, customer service and attention to detail is extremely important to these guys. They are very meticulous with their work, which is so nice to see and I know my money is well spent. Not only are they very friendly but they are also very knowledgeable about the products they recommend and install for you. They also carry a lot of name brands and they just received a bunch of Prinsu racks, and Baja Design’s lights in their inventory, so I had options to chose from.

If you don’t have the opportunity to drop your car off and need to wait, they have a very nice waiting room with snacks, chairs, couch and a TV w/ Netflix.

I would recommend these guys to anyone and I’ll definitely be returning to have my next project install done by Cali Raised Off-Road.

Thanks again guys!</Review>

If you're worried about COVID, do not go here. Owners Randy and Jake don't require any of their staff members or customers to wear a mask. No signage around, nothing. Even if you as the customer wear one, these guys won't be while working in and around your vehicle. I stopped by a few days ago and went upstairs to the showroom to find a bunch of mask-less employees and customers, and walked right out.

Guess i'll wait a few more months before trying again.

PS: If you guys at Cali Raised read this, it might also be a good idea for you to wait until the end of the day to start drilling and building things UPSTAIRS in the middle of the show floor while the phones are going off with no one able to answer them.<//text>

Awsome staff. Purchased ditch lights with a lower bumper light bar and the whole kit. Had a trip planned and wanted an expedited installation. Without hesitation, they squeezed my truck in and made it happen. They were helpful in reviewing the parts needed and explained everything that was going to be done prior to installation. Definitely returning for all my off-road and overlanding needs. Will be recommending them to everyone I know.< /text>

The customer service is practically non-existent. No one answers emails, they don't really seem to understand how their own business works, and when you call to ask questions and spend considerable money they hang up on you.< /Review>

Everything online shows products available until you purchase and have to wait months before it is even shipped or someone to follow up with. Sent emails and no response, if this was the case from the beginning I’d much rather order from someone else and have products by now. Seems once they take your money you don’t matter anymore.< /Text>< Pics>

Had a Cali raised light bar for about a year, and I worked great. Suddenly I noticed a little bit of fog in the lens and so I email them asking if there is a way to defog it. They told me to not worry about it, and they will send me a brand new light bar! Great products and even better customer service. 10/10 recommend!<//Review>

I was extremely impressed with Cali Raised Led's  products and customer service. I called before placing my order about some questions I had about install. Jake who helped me out on the phone was super helpful and professional and walked me through the process. It made it way easier ordering knowing that I could call and get a real answer. After getting my bumper light bar for my Tacoma I can say I made the right choice. That thing is BRIGHT!<//text>

<Review>These guys have the best pricing anywhere in the Los Angeles area. It honestly a cool feeling knowing the quality of the products is comparable to a big brand like RIGID but without the huge price tag. ALSO, they are very fair with their labor/ installation prices. They hooked me up with a lower light bar on my Tundra TRD PRO. I’m super impressed!!</Review>< Rate>

<Text>Bought the side projecting ditch lights with brackets and wiring. Was pretty stoked when I bought them, heard good things about their products. Now over a week after I paid for them they still haven't shipped.  I emailed them and asked where they were a week after purchasing, I got a really fast reply saying they would go out the next day. 4 Days later now and nothing but a printed shipping label. Seems they have decent customer service but I'm bummed it's taking so long to get my lights. Hopefully they are worth the wait.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Packing was good with no items missing or damaged and I followed the install video which took me about an hour to install.
Tip for installation!  Be careful of all fins on the radiator/oil cooler/etc.
You don't want to bend them!
The 5D LED light bar is brighter than other LED bars I've had that came from overseas!  I highly recommend Cali Raised LED and their products!</review>< pics>

I had ordered the side shooter pods along with their ditch light brackets on top of bumper brackets and a 32inch light bar. So I spent some money with them.  Shipping was pretty prompt however when I installed my products, one of my side shooter pods didn’t work no matter what. I called customer service and they basically told me it was my problem. Needless to say I will never spend a dime there nor recommend them to anyone. I steer people very clear from them. That’s part of the reason rigid is so expensive because their product works along with a lifetime warranty and great customer service.</text>

<Text>Products are decent but their customer service is pretty poor.  They sent me a random YouTube video for how to adapt their wiring harness to a four pin illuminated switch for my ditch lights.  When I informed them that the switch wasn’t working correctly they blamed me for using a switch they didn’t sell (the only reason I had to buy a switch they didn’t sell is because they had advertised that a Tacoma switch would fit in a 4Runner, but it doesn’t on 2016 models).  I eventually figured out their ground and hot wires from the relay were swapped (and different from another one of their products - which was wired correctly).  I politely informed them that this wad the issue and they seemed unconcerned that they were selling defective products.   Then I see a video bragging about how their low profile ditch light brackets were better than inferior competitors (and better then the non high profile brackets they already sold me).  There are plenty of better run operations out there.  Don’t waste your time with these guys.</Text><name>Andrew Johnson<//name><pics>None< /pics><userid>108380674177133014018</userid>< GmapID>

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCTS!
Get your gear from somewhere else.. ANYWHERE else!
Paid $30 for shipping took a month for me to receive my light bar. Sent 2 emails.. no response as I waited. Finally called them, shipment got lost. they agreed to send another set out with a 50% discount off shipping? Really? Still didnt get a penny back. Made me wait 30 days for my light ... Bad business. BTW.. Nothing special about the light. Just another Chinese made product with a boosted  “caliraised” price. Not high quality. Not impressed. Included a cheap harness connected to a silly ON-OFF switch. OEM switch NOT included. No support or instructions from these fools. They told me to watch a youtube video, sent me a url of a video showing me how to remove the front bumper cover and totally remove and not reinstall factory air dams. Instead use their single bolt bracket that isn't sturdy at all. The video does not cover wiring your lights. I guess it wasn’t important to show that part. Do some research... there are thorough videos out there that are very detailed in the installation process. I thought Caliraised was reputable but I was wrong. Low quality parts with NO support. What a headache!

Look at other company’s such as Rago Fabrication for mounts and amazon for the light bar and harness. You will save money and be happy with fast shipping and awesome customer service. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY! I really wish I could return this thing but i refuse to spend another penny on return shipping. Not paying these guys another cent.< /Review>

My review is identical to Kevin Taff’s below.

I ordered a set of fog lights a few months back and I loved the product and the service.     Very quick shipping and the appropriate amount of communication.

This experience is the exact opposite.   I placed the order on 1/6/19(Sunday). I received a prompt email confirmation as well as a thank you for your order from Blake.

So far so good I’m thinkin.  I waited until Friday to inquire as to when the product was going to ship.  Blake responded stating that they are going out today (Friday 1/11).  A similar automated email was sent saying they’ve been shipped, that contained the tracking number.

I’ve been tracking them for 4 days now and ups has yet to receive the package.  I sent another email( Monday 1/14)asking when they were going to picked up. At 12:00 mst 1/15 I still didn’t receive an email.

I decided to call them and figure out what’s going on, I was told by the woman that they just received the side projecting lights and they would be leaving today.   She didn’t know why Blake told me they were shipping Friday.

I am always open to waiting a reasonable amount of time IF the delay is communicated.   I think it’s especially frustrating having the feeling that I was deceived to avoid confrontation.

My initial purchase months ago was great, but this one is definitely leaving a bad taste in my mouth.   With so many competitors, I doubt I will buying anything else from this company.   I can’t make any positive recommendations either.

It’s surprising to see the owners comments on the review below.  Good products cannot make up for poor customer service.< /review>

I can only express my major admiration to this specific specific franchise store. Been here several times but my last was ny far the best. Even so we still on pandemic mode.
Food was great and super fresh what else can we ask.

<Review>Midday visit.  Pizza was good, but a bit pricey.  Service a bit slow, but that may have been exaggerated due to the large table of very loud and rambunctious teenagers seated right next to us.  Probably would have given four stars had the dining atmosphere been decent, was like eating in a high school cafeteria.  Lesson learned... Never eat here shortly after high school lets out.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This place needs to honestly be put out of business for how good the food is here.

I have been trying to fast for the last couple of days, and I decided to make my last meal a pasta and some cake.

Great but bad choice.

It’s now been a couple of days later, and I’m still ordering Postmates from this spot!

It’s sooooo gooooood!

Everything was made EXACTLY how I liked it! And the desserts are very much slept on!

I’ll be back after my fast is over! 🤣😅</review>

The chicken Bahn mi salad I ordered was not good at all other than the actual greens. It needed more peanut sauce and the chicken was cold, dry and unseasoned. This salad would have been way better without the chicken or better yet just cook the chicken and it'll elevate the dish. It also took us forever to leave this place.</Review>< pics>

CPK food is always tasty, but they just haven't been able to get their act together when it comes to outside patio service.   Tables are way to close, the passage way through the tables is too narrow and the servers trip over each other trying to service their tables.<//review>

I literally orders just a tomato soup, it came in a fancy HUGE bowl/plate, but I was a bit disappointed on the amount that was served, the plate was bigger than the amount of soup. The spaghetti on the other hand for kids was plentiful, and i was able to share some with him. Either way i love their pasta, just add more soup please 😁< /Review><Time>1583463611860<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Love that the pizzas have cauliflower crust options and we could substitute the meat on the salads with avocados. Highly recommend! The server was also very helpful and nice. She was super patient with our large party and plenty kids. Their kids pastas are also surprisingly really tasty. I think I'll have to borrow my nephews to come with me every now and then 🤣</review>< Pics>

A late lunch on Saturday afternoon at California Pizza Kitchen proved a great choice. Service was great and fast. I ordered a cup of  Baked Potato Soup and hubby had the Barley Soup, both delicious! Then the California Club Pizza, hand tossed crust, Wow!
We were served a great meal in a beautiful atmosphere, relaxed, but food served hot and service on point. Plenty of waitstaff to take care of customers.<//Text>

<Review>Our server was absolutely amazing (the receipt said Jessica, I'm not sure did that was her or just the person logged into the POS system) however, both cooks you could see from the dining room weren't wearing their mask correctly (below the nose the entire time I was there) and other employees would pull their masks completely down to have conversations with the cooks. This made me very uncomfortable seeing as a mask below the nose is equivalent to not wearing one, and none of the managers or other employees seemed to care or tell the cooks to put them up the entire time, as well as a few servers wearing their masks below the nose the whole time we were there. Normally I wouldn't make a deal about it but considering out of the ten or so people we saw working, only two or three actually followed the CDC mask safety guidelines, especially while at their place of work, it was very unsettling. They shouldn't be open for dine in if no one working is going to do the things they're supposed to.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80d9459752c948e9:0x1c8e3da298e21f96</GmapID></record>

Let me say first that the Food is So good and Delicious . The service that i have received the last few times have been poor at the least.  My Waiters lack the most basic of things to remember that we are customers are just because we are not a huge party does not mean you cannot come back and ask to refill our drinks and how are food is. 3 times is enough with this place and my friends have also experience this. Personally i will NOT recommended it anymore. It seams the staff is focus on bigger table for bigger tips when they don't sever or put attention to the customer equally.  Such a shame this place taste so good, This location is not its best.<//review>

<Review>Disgusting and unacceptable! We used to love their food but this was nasty. We had take out and the total bill for only two of us was $78.04. The dumplings were smashed like someone sat on them. My Spinach tequila chicken fettuccine had literally 6-7 small pieces of quarter size chicken. Not worth the money. Spend your money at Cheese Cake Factory instead for pasta.</Review>< name>

The restaurant looks inviting and when we went inside, it was warm and soft music was being played in the background probably jazz. The food presented were fresh and creative, simple yet full of flavors especially the wild mushroom pizza.

The food, the music, the smile of the receptionist and the great company are what made our visit worthwhile.

My first time at California Pizza kitchen and it was disappointing.  First, we waited over an hour for our group due to a misunderstanding.  When we were finally seated, we waited 30 minutes for a server.  We ordered a vegetable salad and a pizza.  The salad was okay and the pizza was cold and tasteless. Since we waited so long, we didn't complain about the pizza. The bill was rather high for the quality and the long wait.  We're not returning there.</review>

Love coming here, especially for a weekday lunch. Such a good team of staffers. Cooks also solid, and experienced. I've eaten here nearly fifty times, and will use any excuse to come back. Even when there's a school event, with 50 plus people, service was still strong. I can think of no higher complements to give. Well done, all!< /review>

Mixed reviews from our party. I had a California Club Sandwich, which I found to be very good. A pizza was also ordered and it had absolutely no cheese on it, only a little tomato or marinara sauce w/ pepperoni and sausage. No Cheese ? They weren't pleased !

Service was good, although slow out of the kitchen, and was a long wait after ordering.< /text>

Good food, friendly staff and nice location.  This CA Pizza Kitchen is in the Otay Ranch shopping area close to dozens of stores.  The staff was busy during our visit, but took time to explain some items on the menu and give us time to decide on what we wanted.  Overall, positive experience and we would visit again.  Definitely recommend!</Review>

<text>Good food and service. Restaurant itself had a little funky smell but not overpowering. Maybe a little pricey for pizza, but it was California so that could explain it. Would have probably garnered 5 stars if not for the odor.< /text>< pictures>

We’e eaten in and taken out. Service and food both times had good elements but also surprisingly bad ones for a somewhat pricy place. Takeout pizzas ready when we arrived for pickup, but salads took another 10 min or so. Weird. If you have hot and cold dishes, why not make the cold first, since they can wait without problem. As it was, salads were good, but pizzas tepid when we finally got the order. Unfortunately, pizzas also overcooked, with tasty ingredients offset by awful crust ranging from
leathery to hard.< /Review>

<Text>As a gluten free eater I don't go for pizza often. When a friend took me to California Pizza Kitchen I thought I was in for yet another salad. Was I surprised by not only the fact that they now carry gf pizza but it was delicious. I will now make it a part of my rotation now.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80d9459752c948e9:0x1c8e3da298e21f96</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Loved the pizza's and the service. Wood fired and tasty, the pizzas are cooked to perfection. Took one home for $5 to bake later. The take home was just as good as the pie we ate at the restaurant.< /text>

This place was super awesome! I went around 1:30pm, so the lunch rush was over for a Friday. My waitress was super quick,  and one of the managers came out with chips and guacamole,  completely complimentary, seeing as how I had never been there before. I ended up ordering pot stickers from the appetizer section, and they were delicious. Plus, they don't use straws to help the environment! I'll definitely be coming back! Thank you for a wonderful lunch!</text>

This is one of our go-to spots for great pizza and surprisingly good salads. I highly recommend the Jamaican jerk pizza - sweet and spicy and always hits the spot.

Be mindful of your takeout order, though. Our last Caesar salad came with vinaigrette instead (why?) and the menu-standard Mushroom, Pepperoni and Sausage pizza had no cheese on it. Lesson learned.  Check it before you leave!<//review>

Trendy food with great service and fair prices. Salads are outstanding. A half salad is enough for a full lunch/dinner portion. The full salad is  rather large!</Review>

<review>I love this place.   Either before or after a good AMC movie which is right next door.  Even just when its my mommy daddy date alone time or the whole family.   My fav dishes are the chicken wraps, avocado rolls,  Rib Mac n Cheese and steak salad .  As for my drink, Dark Red Berry Sangria.    I wont give it a 5 because of the service from the waiters.  Sometimes we get some waiters that are  awesome  or we get some not on their A game if you know what I mean.

Hope this helps , enjoy.....<//review>< Date>

Terrible service,  forgot to bring drinks, never brought the coffee we ordered. No refill offered on sodas. My pizza was burnt, barely any topping on it anyway. No apologies for any of it, save the manager rushing up as we left to thank us for the visit.  Meaningless gesture, please just train and supervise your staff.   As this is not an inexpensive restaurant,  and since other locations are so good, customers deserve so much better.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I am so pleased with this location of CPK.  I usually take a star away because of chains, but I will make an exception this time.  The BBQ chicken pizza is a must, but don't be afraid to have it the cauliflower crust.  It is AMAZING!  There is no loss on taste, but a huge plus when it comes to health (looking at those who do a Palio style or no wheat diet).  I had that and an ice tea.  It's all I needed and have been good to go for hours.  It is actually enough to share for the light eaters.  Three of us just shared the butter cake and ice cream desert as well.  Truly a treat each time I dine.<//review></record>

<text>Had dinner there about an hour ago. Our server was polite and the appetizers were tasty. The trouble was with the kitchen. I ordered a Thai crunch salad with chicken on the side as I am a vegetarian but my husband likes to share some of the salad (with chicken on his). So I'm eating my salad and I find a bunch of chicken mixed in at the bottom, and some pieces are too tiny to even pick out. I lost my appetite after that. I did think it was strange when my salad arrived late (after the other dishes) with soggy crunch noodles and then the chicken arrived even later with pieces of lettuce in it... Yeah put those puzzle pieces together. So they were apparently picking out my chicken but they did a bad job. Thank goodness I don't have allergies or anything. If they think that it is okay to do that with my food then they are definitely doing it to other peoples food as well. This uses to be a place I liked, but I am not planning on ever setting foot in there again.< /text><userid>116854449804363411752<//userid><GmapID>0x80d9459752c948e9:0x1c8e3da298e21f96</GmapID><Rate>2</Rate><pics>None</pics><Name>Lisa Mahan</Name><date>1496540932987<//date>< Response>

I bit down on a Sharp piece of plastic in my salad today.
The manager never aproched me or even try offer an apology.
The food was not bad, the restaurant is just run by a person that really does not care about customer service.< /review>

<Text>I loved this place went in with my Granddaughter and we each had our own personal pizza!!! 1st time was so great I went back with my guy and, on that night the kids pizza was made with no effort (blah... ) and my waitress /server lacked some of the skills required to be a success in the services industries. (Disapeard, hard to catch even when it was slow. By the Time she checked on our table everyone had finished eating except for the bad kids pizza which she did take back into the kitchen and brought another which was awsome however we had to take that one to go.
Overall.
Great food, usually great service, I would recomend it< /Text>< pics>

We were seated in a quiet section of the restaurant at our request. Probably a bad idea because the table service was mostly nonexistent the majority of our meal. When we went to pay for our food, we noticed we had been mischarged. Instead of charging for half salads, we were charged for whole. We ordered half. We wondered why they seemed larger than normal.

As we left a manager asked how our meal was. I said the food was great, but the service could have been better, and that they got our order incorrect. She immediately asked to see our bill. I thought she would adjust to reflect what we'd ordered, but no, she went above and beyond and refunded the full price of both salads. I wasn't expecting that.

So 4 stars, for good food, and a good customer service resolution.</text>

<Text>I dont like posting negative reviews, but on this occasion, I feel compelled to. Anyhow, I  thought I'd give this location another try since I love the menu at CPK and it's close to my house.  In a nutshell, the last couple visits were basically lackluster. I found the staff to be very mediocre and not that attentive.  It took a while for our food to arrive on those occasions. Our last visit wasn't  any different. Although our server was pleasant to deal with. I don't know what happened to the vibe of this location. When it first opened, the staff was better and it had a welcoming vibe.  Perhaps a management change? In any event, I think my last visit will indeed be my last. I'll just have to make the trek to the Fashion Valley location to get my fix.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Good vibe and food and the bartender made very tasty Martinis

Update on next visit: 9/12/19
Complete reverse from last time. Terrible service
Not even that busy. After I got a drink and appetizer, if it wasn't for the person who brought my next order later not a single person came by to take my next request. Empty glass and empty plate in front on someone should be massive hint

Overpriced for decent pizza.+update 12.20.18. The dishwasher are the ones that touch your bread for service after touching a tons of dirty dishes. They are obligated to do so,  Also dishwashers do not have food handlers cards at cpk. Thought everyone should know this. Before you come to this location. Be aware.< /Text>

<Text>I think this place is really good. .y biggest issue is their price. I think it is a little steep for what they serve, but what they serve is delicious. You can tell that it is quality place with first rate ingrediants. The servers know the menu well and are a pleasure to be around. This place is top notch, but just a little too pricy.< /Text>< pictures>

The service, and staff were all great, the food was great, and it was very clean with that said it all reflected back to the atmosphere of the place everyone was very happy the staff, the customer's it was nice to see.
I would have liked to have giving it 5 stars, but 5 Stars only goes to establishments that won't bill me, other than that it was great.< /Text>

<Review>Horrible! Sat at our table for an hour eating bread and another hour before eating our dinner! Offered to leave an extra tip if the waiters/waitresses to sing happy birthday and I was told they don't sing! Skip this place! Not what it used to be! I'd leave negative stars but one is the least you can give. Consider it a minus one!<//Review>< Name>

We eat here a couple times a month, lunch or dinner.. We consistently experience great service, fresh food, and tasty beverages! It's pizza kitchen, not a fancy steakhouse, so I don't expect a tuxedo waiter! If you have been to a CPK before, and liked it, then you will love this one! Right next to movie theatre too! Convenient!< /text>

Rediculously slow service.  Our food came out before our drinks.  We had to walk up to the "to go" desk to get our check.  Our waitress actually stopped us on the way out to apologize...that was the second time we saw her.</Review>

Service was good. But sadly food wasn't. The quinoa and arugula salad had clumpy quinoa and not much flavor. The Thai chicken  pizza was burnt and barely had any toppings. This used to be my favorite pizza. But looks like quality has taken a beating. Won't be going back anytime soon.<//review>

Had a power bowl. It had sprouts and greens and carrots and purple cabbage (?) and chicken and guac and I ate all the chicken and guac and the gauc was good. It also had quinoa. Great for people who are into that kind of stuff. Maybe not as great if you aren't...but they have pizza and steak so it's not like they're known for their power bowls lol.< /Text>

Also, they put very little chicken on their chicken bbq pizza.  The avacado egg rolls were very greasy and the grease over powered the flavor.  Super disappointed and will not be returning.<//Review>< pics>

Today i had my daughters 7th Bday here and we were all blown away of the high customer service we received... The manager today was Jesse, super nice informative patient ( we had 14 kids)... Our waitress was khatia ( I believe) she was amazing, handling a group of almost 30 (with kids and parents) our orders kept coming out on time and everything was on point!!! We left her a huge til bc she deserved it very much!!! I will definitely be coming in again and recommending it!!!
Great job guys!!!</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The service was friendly, the waitress very attentive and smiling, the drinks very rich.
The only detail was that the food took a little while to get to our table, but that could happen anywhere.

(Original)
El servicio fue amable, la mesera muy atenta y sonriente, las bebidas muy ricas.
El ùnico detalle fue que la comida tardò un poco en llegar a nueatra mesa, pero eso podría pasar en cualquier lugar.< /text>< pics>

<Name>JAL PALOMARES</Name><UserId.>118406297752557564310<//UserId.><text>(Translated by Google) Cedar grilled salmon has no grandmother. It is delicious along with the corn salad combination. The atmosphere is very nice and they keep it very clean. The service is friendly. There is free internet. What I didn't like very much was the prices but it's only for special occasions. There is also take away.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>The most rude and unprofessional customer service. Called multiple times and every time getting different information. Last time, someone just hanged up on me, without even trying to help. They definitely have attitude and very arrogant. I have been in few Social Security offices( West side, Burbank) and never had such a bad experience. Very, very upset and disappointed.< /Text>< Pics>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Workers need an adittude adjustment and client support skills. Guards are pratically falling asleep when u ask a question. Need to be scolded in my view. In addition to that the female who works at one of the front desks. Has a heavy adittude. And needs to be put on check by a supervisor or something. You ask a question. Tells you No. But doesnt give you any options any leads. Just a profound no! leave me alone. Not only being completely unprofessional but rude. Please someone has to put this woman and anyone else like her on check. By the way for that Halloween shes was dressed like a black cat. And dressed very inappropriately for work. FYI. This is coming from a straight male.< /text>< Pics>

<text>So I have almost been hesitant to give Serranos Barbershop a review because I wanted to keep this hidden gem to myself! Lol.  My boys and I have been coming here for about 2 months now and I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the quality haircuts and super friendly atmosphere that the owner Annai creates.  I was so tired going from shop to shop being disappointed from careless work and horrible language around my kids.  Serranos is the complete opposite, its so nice to always be greeted by a smiling face and knowing that you are going to get a quality cut.  And I have to honor the bravery that Annai had to make that decision and leave her comfort zone to start her own business, she truly deserves success.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzS2bmNxZGxvg65QcjVO5sT1VQHDxH64Z_1MCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTnVheaP8MAQ3jrCI1OepU6x1dLtJ93GU2Pcc-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkErOYI-rSewlBW-RFP1uBgEMaq9ldR88p8CVE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

Delmi is the friendliest person that has ever cut my hair. She's also very professional and did an excellent job. This was my 2nd time there and it will be my go to place every time I'm in town. I live in Sacramento and I will be visiting every couple of months to see family and get a haircut. I usually only visit 2 or 3 times a year. But thanks to Serrano's and Delmi, my family will see more of me.😁</Text>

With the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak, the shop I've been going to every two weeks for the last six years went under.  Permanently closed.  I'm in Visalia from out of town this weekend and with a little research took a chance on this little shop around the corner from my Mother's house.  My hair really looks great.  I am very particular about my hair, and I am thoroughly satisfied with the result.  I would absolutely return if I'm in the area.  I would reccomend this shop to anyone.</text>

< review>
Love it here. My kids are very picky with who cuts there hair and so far both barbers do a great job. 1 of my boys will only get his hair cut by Annai (not sure if I got that right) but she is amazing and gives her honest opinion as to what may look good. My son finally found someone who can line him up right.
Eddy i think is the Male barber and my son just got a fresh cut from him. I am so happy I found these 2.
By the way Annai also cuts girls hair and does an amazing job. My daughter was so happy with her cut and now my other daughter wants to start going to her instead of the salon. Great job and friendly, welcoming atmosphere.....<//review>

<text>Annai, will tell you to call her Annie because it's a bit tough to pronounce her name haha. But she is one of the best people to cut my hair before. I followed her from her previous place and got a hair cut and I feel born again.

She is really sweet and kind, she likes to smile and laugh so always expect for her chipper self.

Ok so down to business about the hair cut. I am
Super picky about who and how my hair is cut not a jerk but still lol. I like a high and tight fade almost military style haircut but a little more blending and a squared back but still taper all the back and sides so a 0 to taper.

She cleans it up nicely and I can't complain so whenever I am in town I try and stop to get a fade from my favorite barber. So go in and get ready to feel born again.

Oh and cash only<//text>< pictures>

These guys know what they are doing/selling. Just bought Tribe bicep leash. Tribe is their brand. High quality leash designed/built with bodyboarder in mind/heart. I tried cheaper (50%) leash with great reviews from amazon but returned it immediately after receiving due to major design flaws. Tribe leash is superior in design and quality: allows buckling up with one hand and attaches through the ring giving more flexibility. Great product and Co! Worth every penny. P.S. I was not paid to write this review.<//review>

<Review>SERVICE ! I live in SD. Getting to San Clemente is not impossible but when its Monday morning and your work load is avalanching and you just want a fresh board or fins for the weekend and you want some advice and not have to read a thousand blog/forumn reviews.... CHAT THEM UP! I started a quick chat with their staff and they were mega informative and were really able to make me sure of my online purchase with them. Super service and basically anything you need they got it!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRU3cJiQ2zIOWOhfJK4HDfNmew8EGi_kSqNwM-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Bought some Gyroll Fin Inserts for a used pair of DMC fins I received for my triathlon training.  I am in-between sizes so the fins were a little floppy on me.  The inserts solved that problem nicely and at a great price.  Fast shipping from eBodyboarding.com, too.  Solid product and great overall shopping experience.</Text>

So far, everything went well. The Co. is so busy, they are out of most of the color choice. But I am glad they still had the right size for me. When I had questions, they are very fast to respond best that can be expected.</text>

The team at Ebodyboarding is the best!!  Tommy and Jay really know their stuff, they have extensive knowledge on their products and want to help you decide what works best for you.  I can be a tough customer and had a sizing issue but both of them had the patience of a saint and I can’t thank them enough 🙏.  They have a real family atmosphere and they treat all their customers with respect and make you feel welcome.  I won’t be going anywhere else to get my products, thank you guys!!<//text>

All I can say are good things! I purchased a board, then found it cheaper elsewhere that same day. Jay and Vicki quickly matched the price.

Ordered on Day 1 and board arrived on Day 2.

Customer service, as always, was top notch. E-mails were responded to within a couple of hours.

Also, these two were legends in the sport and did a lot for CA bodyboarding. They continue to help keep the sport alive in the Golden State.

Cool people, cool business.<//Review>

<review>This is the place to go for sure. Knowledgeable and friendly body boarders are there to greet you. Customers can ask any questions they have regarding the sport and they will get the appropriate answer.

<text>Best bodyboard shop in town! The whole team goes out of their way to make sure you get what you need. I never feel like they’re trying to push a certain product on me. They ask questions. Give recommendations. And share their experiences with those products. I have no reason to go anywhere else as they have everything you need!</text>< pics>

Haven't even received my fins yet, and I'm already impressed.  Ordered my fins yesterday morning, then got a shipment notice.  I figured it was a the typical email that it was shipped and when you put in the tracking number it says a label was created, then 4 days later it ships.  NOPE!  I was wrong.  It was an actual shipment notice saying by fins would be here today.  I was still a little skeptical.  Woke up this morning, the tracking showed it went from California to Las Vegas and is currently out for delivery.  I am super impressed especially since the Amazon estimated delivery date was for the day before I go to SoCal to bodyboard (2 weeks from yesterday).  Thanks for the quick service!< /text>

Order some hats from Jay and Vicki. They emailed me immediately to clarify my order was correct because I ordered a different color. The hats came way quicker than expected. Great customer service!!< /Review>

Just getting into bodyboarding. Found ebodyboarding.com by a simple google search for bodyboards and boy am i glad i did!! Customer service is TOP NOTCH, any questions ive had about ANYTHING to do with bodyboarding, from size of board to get to plugging a board to leash size, anything and everything has been answered in a timely and professional manner (well duh they are pros). Jay and Vicki the owners really seem to care alot about keeping the sport alive and well for future generations and even some older folks just getting into it. Could not be happier with the experience ive had with them and would HIGHLY recommend them for any of your bodyboarding needs!!<//text>

<Text>Best knowledge for bodyboarding, beyond the shopping itself it gives a great sense of community when the associates at the store or on the phone can lend from their knowledge and experience. Add to the fact that Jay is a YouTube guru on all matters concerning bodyboarding and you get a sense of a surf clan. I also ride their Tribe JL Volume and dig it a lot!! Thanks Tommy and Gianna for the great tips.< /Text>< pics>

I had a great buying experience with eBodyboarding. I wanted to order online, but I'm brand new to the sport, so I didn't really know what to order. I called eBodyboarding for some help and spoke to Giana, who was super informed and helpful. She asked me some questions about my height, weight, where I planned to ride ect. This narrowed it down to several options that I could choose from. Also got recommendations for my arm strap and fins. I placed my order online and it shipped for free to my home in 2 days. It was a really great experience, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into bodyboarding.< /text>

I had such an awesome experience, the owner really welcome you in their warehouse with a very open mind to really help you and not just sell you the most expensive item. He spent a lot of time with me showing me all the options and gave me honest advise and what price made more sense to me based on my expectations.
I would definitely buy again from them. You got a loyal customer forever!!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Cannot say enough great things about eBodyboarding!! Every time I order something it is shipped the next day if not that day. The quality of products received are fantastic and only wish they had a shop on the East Coast that I could visit. Jay and Vicki Reale, the owners are more than nice and always available to answer any questions you might have. I will always look at this shop first when ordering my equipment!!< /text>

I bought a "Tribe" board from eBodyboarding that will float my big body. Finally got to use it today in 2-4ft surf. The sound of the board slicing through the water as I dropped in is what I have been missing in my life. Happy with the shop and the product. Thank you!<//Text>

Jay patiently answered all our questions.  We were riding the waves within a week - great instruction videos on-line too.  We'll continue to shop at eBodyboarding where you get that extra personal customer care. Thank you to Jay & Vicki & Staff!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>5</Rate>< Date>

He let me know about some cushioned socks that would compliment my purchase. Viper’s used to come with cushions in the toe, that was discontinued a few years back. So when I asked Jay about it he educated me on the product. A pair of cushion inserts were only $15.00 more, So I added them to my order, with Jay’s help. The additional purchase put me into free shipping!
I would never have known had Jay not personally looked into It for me. Super happy with the experience and I will always go to them for my Surf Swimming needs!  Top notch customer service!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Super happy with my order from eBodyboarding.com. Shipping was incredibly fast. I ordered yesterday after lunch and it arrived this evening. And the customer service from Jay and Vicki is truly spectacular. Ordering from their store feels like a throwback to a time before Amazon dominated e-commerce. I received a "thank you" note for my order. How cool is that? Consider me a new loyal customer.<//Review>

Vicki and Jay are really Awesome!  Walked in, immediately greeted and had all my questions met.  Did not feel like I was pressured in any way.  Got my measurements and where I would be mostly using my board to help set me up with some new boarding accessories as well that I asked for.  Felt like they had everything I wanted right there with options based on my preferences.</text>

The customer service is great! This shop happened to be the only shop I could find online that had the specific sized bodyboard I was looking for in stock. After placing the order, Jay followed up in an email saying I didn't get a leash with my board and included a link to the leashes. I was originally undecided about getting a leash and figured I could always get it later and install it myself (I found their YouTube channel and it looked simple enough), but I took a look anyway and saw that the leashes could be installed for free if purchased with a board, so I asked if I could still add a leash to my order and have it installed. They responded quickly and got things taken care of without any problems.</text>

I've only ever ordered online, but my experiences with the store since its inception have always been great.

Great shipping promptness; great flow of info (Jay is always answering questions); great selection of products; great service all around.

One of these days I'll actually make it down there and shop the old-fashioned way (but hopefully in a day and age without the need for a mask.)

I can't say enough great things about ebodyboarding.com, they're a model business and I always look forward to ordering from them.</Review>

Had a great experience at the eBodyboarding warehouse, Jay was very friendly & extremely knowledgeable about the products. He did not try to up sell me on anything and provided honest pros, cons, and personal opinions about the equipment. I would highly recommend stopping in if you live locally, thanks for the new ride!<//Review>

Great customer service. Just ordered my first what I would call real body board. I had many questions and both Jay and Vicki answered them quickly and made sure to let me know if I had more to not hesitate to ask. I definitely felt they cared about helping me choose the right board and weren't just trying to sell me something.</Text>

My husband and I had an extremely positive experience in your store!  Tommy was a wealth of information.  Before arriving at your store, we researched body boards on the internet and then specifically looked for a store that is more personal and we found ebodyboarding.  We didn't want to buy online.  Tommy helped us pick out boards that were right for us, not right for the bottom line store profit.  Thank you Tommy!! We left the store and immediately went to the beach for a trial run.  Totally satisfied with our choice of boards!  Thank you again Tommy for all your help!!  Happy Customers!!< /Text>

< Review>
The owners, Jay and Vicki Reale, are bodyboarding legends.  I found Ebodyboarding through the great how-to and product review Youtube videos they produce.  When I inquired about getting a new board that would be a good fit for my height, weight and normal surf conditions Jay answered me himself within a couple hours.  He included a video link for how to plug my new board with a leash, which was helpful, and even directed me to the closest bodyboarding hangout for where I live.  What a guy!

My new board and leash got to me within 2 days.  Have taken the new board out a few times and am loving it.  Thanks Jay, Vicki and team!</Review>

Have not used the board in water yet, so that is pending. BUT, I can say that the customer service was excellent. My pre-purchase questions were addressed very quickly and in detail. Correspondence was excellent. By comparison to other boards, the price for quality was very good. Shipping speed was excellent. I am very impressed so far and would highly recommend this company !< /review>

<review>Been bodyboarding for 30 years and dealt with many retailers through that time. One thing that always stood true through the years, was that your local surf shop was the place to go to ask questions, find out what's new and stay in the know. Having that same experience online with an even larger selection and the ability to receive that same guidance.... That's these guys. I can't say enough good things about ebodyboarding.

I'm on the east coast, never stepped in their retail store, but know they are there to help you through the way, is a huge. The selection is perfect. My biggest takeaway is this continues that trend of the local shop no matter where you are.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>I placed an order and thought everything was on schedule, had a tracking number and everything from usps. I received a message on wed saying my order is on its way then Thursday I get a order returned and refunded email, I reached out to ebodyboarding to clarify and I was told my shipment was returned for an unknown reason. A little disappointing after reading all these good reviews and placing an order for a birthday gift just to have it returned before ever receiving. Hopefully down the road we can try to do business again.
*UPDATE* I was contacted the next day by Jay & Tommy I received an email with a sincere apology and if I was still interested they would re ship my order, there was an issue with the postal service and I can not blame ebodyboarding. The fact they reached out and apologized multiple times and tried to make things right is customer service at its finest. I love the ocean and with Covid around it’s hard on everybody so I called and replaced my order. Thanks Jay, Tommy and Staff!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The one stop shop! Getting back to body boarding I needed some guidance. I am no longer a skinny 10 year old kid that weighs 100 pounds. I found myself needing to be informed on what is best for me when picking out a board. With so many options it can be confusing. I am glad I came here!!!
Now 40 years old over 6ft and close to 200lbs the owner new exactly what I needed for my skill level and type of riding I would be doing.
If your like me and getting back into the sport of body boarding come here and get setup correctly from the start.< /review>

I was confused about a few things regarding Bodyboards and related equipment, as this was my first board, but the staff at eBodyboarding were happy with giving me the answers I needed, and quick to respond, too, so I bought from them. It was as simple as that. I live in México. My entire order arrived sooner than I expected and was complete. I only wish they sold skim boards. I need one of those as well.</text>

The best service, and truly an amazing selection. When I emailed with a question, the response came super quick (and to my surprise it was answered by one of my childhood idols, which blew me away!). Board pricing is far and away better than everyone else.  I recently moved to Florida and have had issues finding high end equipment, ebodyboardinging is the site to click for serious riders. Add in it's a family owned business that supports the sport, 5 stars all the way. Thanks again Jay!< /Text>

<text>This is definitely one of the best body board businesses around. Not only were the prices right but the staff was very helpful. I forgot to order a leash for my board and they sent me an email with a direct number to them to call. They helped me get a leash and are installing it for me. I'll be using eBodyBoarding for all my body board needs from now on!</text>< Pics>

(online experience review) Uncompromising customer service. Direct access to actual subject matter expertise from board design, build/materials, outfitting, use/care, etc. Jay is da man! I don't think you'll find a better selection online. I went w/ their house brand (Tribe) and got a 44'' Guard. I"m 6'1 190 and farily athletic. Surf in warm water in FL's east coast. Perfect for me, and I was steered away from a more expensive Tribe model. Highly recommend and appreciate the work this small, American, high-integrity business is getting done. I can only imagine how great of an experience it must be to get to their physical store and get personalized attention and hands on the product before buying.< /Review>

They have made the online shopping experience to be as good as shopping in the store. They are extremely helpful with online chat, product videos, excellent and fast follow-up with questions, fast delivery and simply, their show of appreciation. It can't be beat. It is obvious the owners give 100% to providing the best shopping experience and sharing their knowledge. Truly, they couldn't have a better thing going.< /review>

<text>Bodyboarding is new to me, but I filled out the form on the ebodyboarding website which Jay personally responds to, advising you on the recommended equipment for your desired board/equipment/level of expertise.

He responded in around 2 or 3 hours, kept my budget in mind, and just seemed like a really chill guy.  It's a local, family owned business and the emphasis on customer service is very clear.  Free shipping in the US is a huge plus, and I hope to visit the store in person soon.</text><user>117677073536964754518<//user>< pictures>

Immediately after my purchase of a new bodyboard, I received a personal email informing me that I had forgotten to purchase a leash. I let the owner know that I had one and thanked him for the thought. I informed them I hadn’t purchased a new bodyboard in 15 years and was excited to see what all this new technology was about. I plan on driving up from San Diego and seeing this shop in person. Thanks for the great customer service in a time where that seems to be in short supply.< /text>

This was a great shopping experience.  The other reason I bought from eBodyboarding was because they are a small family business and wanted to support them for that.  If you need a board or anything else this is a great place to look.<//Text>

<Text>I have been buying from them for 20 years and every transaction is treated the same, with customer service being paramount.   I think some truly big companies need to look at Jay and Vicki’s model and learn what it means to put the customer first.  FYI, the size of the order does not matter, every time I am treated like a VIP.

The body boarding community needs eBodyboarding more then they may know.  Back in the 80’s when I first started riding in NY, finding anything decent was like a treasure hunt, went thru 2 sets of fins (blue and yellow) which both broke at the ankle and since we did not have internet, buying was difficult.  If a surf shop had more then 7-10 body boards, it was our best bet.  Once I drove 70 miles because I was told the surf shop catered to us and what did I find, about 3 fin choices and about 15 boards to choice from.

In the most trying times in my 60 plus years on this rock, we need to support  eBodyboarding more then ever, Am@#$n will never give you the variety, quality or customer service Jay and Vicki do.< /Text>< Response>

<text>Have not even received my board yet, but I wanted to leave a positive review already. I was a believer that customer service was long gone in today's world. Jay proved me wrong, their customer service is beyond awesome.  Jay personally picked out a selection of boards to fit my height, weight and budget.  He let me know of a better quality board that was just over my budget.  To me it was worth the few extra dollars to get higher quality.  Jay is very personally responsive via email . He answered all my questions before I even hinted that I was ready to buy. His website has a lot of information and great videos about body boarding.  Overall it was a first class purchasing experience and I'm super excited for my new board. I will be a life long customer.<//text><UserId.>117888337971372508258</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I recently purchased a Tribe bodyboard from eBodyboarding.com.  I can't say enough good things about the customer service and product selection.  I was able to get help selecting a board from Jay, one of the owners, and his help really made it easy to select the right board.  The website is easy to use, shipping was free, and the board performed great.  The leash I purchased with the board fit perfectly and has performed flawlessly.  I would definitely recommend eBodyboarding and their products to everyone and will come back tp them for my next board.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1592511907659, 'text': 'Stoked!

I’ve known this bodyboard website for longtime and I noticed they were in San Clemente California.  I had to go see the warehouse myself which was about an hour drive away.  I was helped by Vicki which was one of the owners.  She was very knowledgeable on picking a board my size and style of riding.   I definitely recommend this to a friend or family looking for a bodyboard.  Skip the surfshops and go here or order online.  Great service!  Thank you ebodyboarding!<//Text>

These guys were great.  Sent over an email asking for a suggestion for what size board would work best for me and got a response the next day.  Ordered my Science body board and leash and shipped the next day.  Received here on the east coast 4 or so days later in perfect condition.  Great service and fast shipping.  Hope to use it this week.  Thanks guys!!!!<//Review>

My first board Chief flex 42" killer one. Just got my second board Reale Deal 42" and Tribe fin too boards work awesome. I'm going to order Chief flex pp board 42" and the new Hunter board when this comes out. Good shop ships to Hawaii shipping little bit expensive but worth it 3 to 4 days very happy when my board comes in the right day and North Shore pumping 4 to 6 sand bars believe me its worth it when u come from hawaii.

I submitted a question in the late evening and Jay responded first thing in the morning. I was looking for a very specific sized bag and Jay tried several boards to insure I received the bag I was looking for. I appreciate all the time he took with me for a $30 bag. They have really cool stuff and I highly recommend eBodyboarding. Jay rocks!</Review>

THE REALES ARE THE REALE DEAL!!!

Absolutely lovin’ my brand new Tribe board!!  Great design and components and very well-built.  Quality control is top-notch.

Gianna was very helpful and was so knowledgeable with all things bodyboarding. It was a pleasure meeting both Gianna and Jay as well!

Also, the correspondence has been impeccable and super refreshing. Brings a smile to my face.

What an amazing HQ in San Clemente and I’m so glad I went.  I was in awe of all that the HQ had to offer but this trip was dedicated to a new board only.

Looking forward to new adventures with my Tribe.

Cheers!!</review>< Time>

Every time I have a chance to support an independent family-owned business I do it. When those businesses deliver the product and service even better than most big companies, they for sure get my loyalty. Their pricing is on point, they always have what I need/want and their service surpasses all. I'll be a lifelong customer.</review>

<Text>I messaged an online representative who recommended The Scout by Tribe.
I ordered The Scout by Tribe on Friday, December 13th for $74.76. ($49.95 for the bodyboard + $24.81 for UPS ground shipping.)
I received The Scout by Tribe today, Saturday, December 21st.
Since it arrived before Christmas, I am one happy customer.</Text><date>1576963940507< /date>< gmap_id>

<text>Prior to our vacation in Mexico, I bought two boogie boards and a board bag online with very short notice. I am not well versed in buying boogie boards and I found the website very helpful in picking out the proper sized board. Shortly after the order was placed with very expedited shipping, I received a call from the store asking to clarify the purchases. They had noticed that I had not purchased the leashes and worked out adding in the leashes and changing the shipping to an additional day to make it a bit more economical. I then received another call to make sure that the leashes were installed on the correct side of the board (right hand or left handed). The shipping went out that very day and arrived two days later in pefect shape. Thank you for a wonderful experience and we look forward to using our new boards!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have worked in the bodyboarding industry for 20+ years. During that time I have purchased goods from ebodyboarding, I have recommended guests of my company (Bodyboard-Holidays) and I have asked for advice from Jay and Vicki. Each time the customer service and range of equipment has been second to none. These guys have seen it, done it and ridden it in the world of bodyboarding. There is no one more qualified to deal with your order - you simply will not receive a better service - any where (not just bodyboarding retailers!). Do not consider shopping else where, these guys are the option to take for the best service. Keep up the great work! You just don't see these standards in retail these days unless the owners clearly love what they do!<//text>

The website is great, the selection is great, and Jay was very helpful about making suggestions for me based on the online form. Still I wanted to visit the warehouse just to see everything. The Custom X Beast is a monster to behold. At the warehouse Jay was patient with my shopping and helped me pick some really nice stuff. The waves were good today and I am so happy that I have a board that does what I want now.< /text>

I was so impressed with this company I have 0 reservations about giving them 5 stars! They went above and beyond to make sure I had the right board, fins and all the accessories that go with them. I have been in many surf shops and if you could not get the level of expertise when it comes to this equipment.
Please buy from this small business so they can stay around and serve our community.<//review>

< Review>
The folks at eBodyboarding care about every detail from the moment you click submit on your order.

They stay in constant communication by letting you know they received your order, when it ships and when it’s delivered. For me, all of those things add up to feeling very confident when buying from them.

On top of amazing customer service, they also offer everything you could possibly need for bodyboarding which you cannot find in any local surf shops anymore (what’s up with that??!) So far I’ve gotten a new bag, fins, sweatshirt and fin tethers. All of which were just as described and have performed perfect.

Lastly, they are accessible. I had questions about sizing on my Mike Stewart Viper fins so I called them and Nathaniel provided me with the exact solution.

I can’t give enough stars and I thank you eBodyboarding for staying committed to the sport.

I am so happy I found this company during a Google search.  I was not finding the right body board bag on Amazon so I found the Ebodyboarding website and they had so many options.  I sent them a message asking for recommendations based on the boards I needed to put in there and they replied quickly.  We took the bag to the beach and everything fits great, and I think the bag will be very durable.  The bag isn't too bulky and the sand comes off it nicely.   I'm sooo glad it is the right size for our boards.  The bag we had before was too small and ended up tearing really badly.  It was also surprisingly affordable.  Oh, and I got it so much faster than I expected.< /Text>

<Review>My recent experience with eBodyboarding was amazing. Purchases were received quickly and in perfect shape despite the holiday craziness. One item, which was not available at eBodyboarding, was sent from another company. When the board arrived (late I might add) and was an incorrect size, all it took was a quick phone call to eBodyboarding to get the correct size board sent. We were under a time crunch as we had just a few days before leaving for a trip, but they made it happen for us. I very highly recommend eBodyboarding.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dcf37002dba845:0xa9d28b1d9f13a1ee< /gmap_id>< Response>

<review>Used the "Booger Picker" feature giving my height, weight, etc, and was pleasantly surprised by the personally written email I received the next day.  Was quoted a board and size that was not only an excellent recommendation, but also not the highest price from the list. Just a fair and honest recommendation (where else will you find this?).  Two emails back and forth later, ordered the board, new fins to fit my thicker feet and ankles, and some accessories all for less than I expected to pay going in to the process for just a board.  Very personable, very honest, and extremely reasonable. Shipped out quickly, too!  Jay and Vicki represent all of the best that gets lost when Mom n Pops lose out to e-commerce. Can't recommend them highly enough!!!!</review>< Pictures>

<text>If you're local to So. Cal totally worth any drive to go there in person and pick out your gear. Jay knows his stuff and they are super organized. Entire shopping time for my daughter to get a new board and fins was under 15 minutes which as a guy, is important to my lack of patience. Great selection, good peeps. I'm sure the online experience is also solid. Family run surf business for sure so they'll treat you right.

Drove up from San Diego and was helped for nearly an hour hand picking a board that would fit me perfectly. Absolutely outstanding customer service and attention to detail. Won't buy anywhere else and well worth the hour drive each way to get that kind of service! Thanks Again!<//Review>

GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  after placing my order, I realized I should have ordered not just 1 but 2 of that item (finless conversion kit for my son's Beater board).  Sent them an email, they contacted me back super fast (before they opened) and added the second item to my order before it was shipped.  Waiting for my package now...<//Text>

My new science launch arrived today. I'm absolutely over the moon with it. I can't get the sizes I want here in the UK so I had no choice but to order overseas. Even though I went for Economy shipping to keep the cost down, it arrived a week later in the UK. First class tracking service from start to finish. Will definitely be ordering in the future.

Highly Recommended! I have been body boarding for about 20 years,  recently purchased a body board at the San Clemente location and I have to admit this has been the best body board shopping experience I have had. They are very knowledgeable  and helpful. This will be my go-to place from now on.</review>

<review>If you’re looking for a bodyboard this is the place! Drove up from SD and had done some initial research and had a few boards in mind. Jay took the time to show me additional options and I ended up going with a cheaper but better fitting board for me. He set me up with all remaining gear and got an awesome carrying bag that holds everything. Good service is harder and harder to find these days and their prices are legit.<//review></record>

It is always great dealing with this company, and I have made many purchases going back to over 12 years . They have great product knowledge and fair prices .  I live in the U.S. virgin Islands and my most recent purchase was mailed out to me the same day as my order was placed and it arrived within days.</review>

Jay is the best with advice, insights and service when it comes to all aspects of body board equipment and all their purchasing decisions. Shop no where else but with Jay. It doesn't get better than Ebodyboarding.</Text>

I have worked in the bodyboarding industry for 20+ years. During that time I have purchased goods from ebodyboarding, I have recommended guests of my company (Bodyboard-Holidays) and I have asked for advice from Jay and Vicki. Each time the customer service and range of equipment has been second to none. These guys have seen it, done it and ridden it in the world of bodyboarding. There is no one more qualified to deal with your order - you simply will not receive a better service - any where (not just bodyboarding retailers!). Do not consider shopping else where, these guys are the option to take for the best service. Keep up the great work! You just don't see these standards in retail these days unless the owners clearly love what they do!<//text>

Difficult to find bodyboarding gear in the Panhandle of Florida. I remember when Jay and Viki were professional riders in the late 80's and 90's. I own SUP's, surfboards, and bodyboards. I always reach for my bodyboard on the bigger gnarly days!!</Review>

<Text>Buy online or stop by and get personalized help in finding the beach products that you are looking for. Jay and Vicki Reale are former professional bodyboarders that know the products they carry inside and out. The customer service at Ebodyboarding is second to none. This is the only place that I shop for my gear and I strongly recommend that you shop there too.<//Text><user>108136494720703347087<//user><GmapID>0x80dcf37002dba845:0xa9d28b1d9f13a1ee< /GmapID>< pics>

<review>Jay was very helpful for me purchasing Voit UDTs. He has a wide selection of fins, and many other products for enjoying bodyboarding and bodysurfing, etc at good prices! I highly recommend his website, and it was a pleasure visiting his store. I will be back!</review><pictures>None</pictures><gmapID>0x80dcf37002dba845:0xa9d28b1d9f13a1ee</gmapID></record>

Great plays and great customer service. They helped me out a lot. Even though I didn't buy a bodyboard the first time I was there I learned a lot about boards and different things that you would need to know to  get deeper into the sport Jay even offered to let me send him pictures of used bodyboards that I would find somewhere else to let me know if they were a good board for me I definitely think that I will come back to buy my dear here when I'm ready to get serious about bodyboarding in the future< /review>

(Translated by Google) 100% recommended store.

Fast shipping and very well packaged, both tables and inventions, fins, ... etc. Also, if you have doubts, they respond super fast, and in a very kind and effective way.

My first purchase with them was in 2006, and today is the first place I look when I need new material. They have been in this for many years, they care about their customers, and it shows.

Good waves!

Tienda 100% recomendable.

Envío rápido y muy bien empaquetado, tanto de tablas como de inventos, aletas,... etc. Además, si tienes dudas, te responden súper rápido, y de manera muy amable y eficaz.

Mi primera compra con ellos fue en 2006, y a día de hoy es el primer sitio que miro cuando necesito nuevo material. Llevan muchos años en esto, se preocupan por sus clientes, y eso se nota.

< Review>
First time customer, Johna did an excellent job both listening and explaining the whole Sports Clips experience. Yes experience..not just a haircut...got the shampoo, hot towel, massage and perfect haircut. Love the option of free neck and around the ear clean up between cuts. Place very Covid clean and sanitized. During checkout Johna put in notes of my haircut so if she is not available my preferences are on file. Thank you Johna and Sports Clips, I will be back...PS my wife loves haircut, so boss is happy..lol</Review>

My Hairstylist Kim hooked me up with a great MVP Haircut full service experience. It felt great to have a fresh experience from a trusted franchise brand like Sport Clips. I've been to 15 Sport Clips locations across 3 different states and the MVP experience, products, sports TVs and full service are second to none. Bravo Team! Thanks and Cheers.< /review>

<Response>None</Response><Pics>None< /Pics><Review>07.07.20 3pm - Showed up several minutes earlier than my estimated time with Kim during my lunch break.  I checked in and the roster showed I was 2-3 minutes out. Kim mentioned someone accidentally was in front of me and it would be 25 more minutes. What is the point of a queue line and an app if it’s not honored. I wanted to give this place another chance but this is the second time this has happened. I’ll never go back here again. Time is money right? I’ll stick with scheduling a week ahead with my stylist. Zero convenience going here and a total waste of time. My opinion, I think Kim didn’t want to wait for me. Simple as that. Shared my story with a friend that used to go here. Same story.</Review>< username>

Very gimmicky,  unauthentic, and service/haircuts are average at best. Seems like they just have the generic sports theme and hire pretty young girls to attract young men... I mean, I get it... It worked on me. Once... But it's a novelty.  If that's your thing, cool. I just want a good haircut,  and I didn't get one. Not for how much I was charged.  Mediocre at best, and that goes for the rest of the haircuts I saw as well.< /Text>

I have gone to sports clips for about 2 years and it's an excellent modern barbershop.
- The service is friendly.
- You can show them a picture and they can usually do a pretty good job replicating it.
- Though all the stylists do a wonderful job, I would highly recommend Veronica if she's available.
- Basic haircuts are a bit pricey. $22 for a regular without a tip.</text>

Rene gave me a nice cut and was nice to talk to. Their online check-in system was useful to skip the wait. The prices are decent and they even had a new customer discount that wasn't advertised, so that's a bonus. I'll be going back here next time.<//Review>

<Review>They got me so mad though, was cutting my hair just fine all I wanted was trim, then they made a big cut of no return on just this one side now it's all uneven.  Either need to buzz or wait however long for it to grow back on the side.

Friendly service though, and she was cutting it great was looking good then idk what happened.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Sports clips with online check-in - yup! I really like their setup. They cut a mean fade. Carissa is the manager. She runs a tight ship but keeps it fun at the same time.< /Text>< user_name>

<Review>I've been getting my haircut here for years. I really enjoy this place and I'm not really that into sports. I like the fact I can see just about any stylist and she will cut my hair the way I want without butchering it. They also have deals once or twice a year where you can buy three haircuts at once and save $. Everyone is always super polite and always has a smile on there face.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80ec6ca579749f5d:0xa10921fa01dd2a2a<//gmap_id></record>

I have been their loyal customer since they open. You know what? Happy customer keep going back right?! Especially that refreshing MVP package is my favorite service which I pick every time. This store not only for men's haircut and ladies are welcome too. I never have a bad hair cut there. Awesome staff, excellent 5 stars customer service. See for yourself and you will be amaze! 👍🏻< /review>

<Text>I have NEVER had the opportunity to give a stylist a 5 star review.. Hell i have never had a stylist i could trust to do what im requesting... I cant afford 1 of those stylists... so i had to do a last minute haircut for my 2 boys the day before school started and it was BUSY!!  Ok so the check in process.. Its awesome... You can go about Your day while you wait, they give you a drop in time (about 30 min wait from there, or not... We got in before our "arrival time", but we arrived early.. (I have no idea how they operate on a regular day.. This was the day before back to school)
1st I took my 5yr old son back, we met JOHNA..  She was very attentive to how i wanted my sons hair. He has really long curly hair and i had a pretty specific style in mind to reduce tangles and keep the length.. She offered a couple ideas to add to mine so it woukd come out to more of what i was requesting..  She did an absolutely AMAZING job.. It came out so much nicer than i could ever expect! She was so kind to my son, she never got frustrated or showed any kind of irritation. And my son can be excited and wiggly at times.. (That was his 2nd hair cut)
Next up in my 3rd grader... My son wanted nothing to do with a hair cut.. Wants to keep his hair long..
My son was super stoked about his clean up cut.. No body has been able to perfect what i request on him.. Its always to short or left uneven.. Or just not right...
Anyways.. We fell inlove with her.. This is my 1st awesome experience with a stylist...
For MY next visit to a stylist, i am giving her a try for myself..
I dont leave lengthy reviews on the norm, but i felt this woman deserves to have some sunshine her way! I absolutely adore her and is who my kids will be frequenting! And the price is Super awesome!
(Same price as the competitor's that butcher your hair or do whatever they want and oh well it grows back!!!)
Thanks Johna! We will see you in a few months!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Gotten my hair cut here many of times. They always do a good job on the hairline and are great with fades and other hairstyles. It does get a little busy, but the cut is worth the wait.< /Review>

My 6 yr old loves the flat screen TVs, we got the shampoo and back massage, hot towel facial, and a great hair cut. Lots of perks for the low $19 price. He was very relaxed.< /review>

< review>
My ex gf with almost no experience gave me a better haircut.  Just asked for a trim and they botched it.  Keep leaving different reviews cause more I look at it the madder it get.

Started out fine then just cut it wayyy to short on one spot.  unfixable until it grows back out. Can't believe they would do me like this.

3 stars nice service and just seems like it was an accident because it was going fine, maybe today just wasn't their day.</review>

< Review>
I really like this Walmart. It's clean and well organized. It has wide open ailses, stocked shelves full of items, and direct access to the mall.</Review>

<Text>Prompt courteous service!  Bonnie in the Buena Park store, in your electronics dept. gave me a formal breakdown on selecting the appropriate printer to purchase that would supply a larger print capacity without having to frequently buy cartridges for the current printer I'm using.  Next week I will be back to buy that printer, which by the way was out of stock!  She's awesome!  Quite knowledgeable!<//Text><Time>1617145027830< /Time><gmap_id>0x80dd2bd8ff75a859:0x7c8cccd268710dc<//gmap_id>< user>

<UserId.>109400339007566227056<//UserId.><Name>Simply Dee</Name><time>1617876466899</time><rating>3</rating><Review>Saturday, April 3, 2021 and I made the wrong decision to stop at Walmart on this Easter Weekend.  Should have gotten a clue from the congested parking lot.

Well, everybody, their mothers, fathers, grannies, and long lost loved ones were out shopping today.  Should have gotten BACK in my car to try another day...only if I wasn't dead set on finishing my little home project and to grab a few small boxes to store unused items (yes, I'm sharing all my business hoping to convince you to offer some assistance to poor little ole me😪...no, well, maybe next time).

Good gravy!  It was hard to navigate the isles, everywhere you turned you ended up running into another cart...carts in front of you, to the left, as soon as you went on one side to navigate the isles, here comes another cart.  Even went down an isle and a family had the area blocked.

A lot of the needed cleaning products were out of stock, thought that by now things would be easier to purchase...try again another day next week.
I knew it was time to get when a gentleman was pushing his cart at a fast pace yelling that he was sick of trying to get around people....homeboy was not having it!🤬😡

People...please understand when you head to Wal-Mart,  bring your patience, at the end of the day....it's not that serious!  Calm down.

Who'd thought a quick shopping run to Wal-Mart would wear me straight out!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO34khAhLF2zXXwfCCvo9szXZ2sv4PRIHjJf1LY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCwwx-cnqbKoxTij0rzJ0EC-QT37MPFGGw-KPM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv7_fw1K7FtTO-k2PJ1pB2eUKdQNIX4cCCuSgz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPouL-MX2CLNKfJZGahOpw4eyRLfTLm-p_VmDK_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdQ_PUDwB5NQK_3-XBcxDsizD1aeK8yUYIHEQz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw6ppK_00qTnKiQBkT3fH01CMZmEMbRGPShOjZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Not great, not Terrible. For the size of the store, it seems they would have room for a little produce but apparently not. Crowded with few people working registers. Not a great store.<//Text>

Best experience ever on the automotive side. Kevin helped me out so much. I had an oil leak and he did what an experience mechanic would do. Treat it fast. I'm so glad my engine didn't blow off because there was no more engine oil. He was so professional. Definitely going back.i was out in 15mn.<//text>

<Text>The cashier was awesome and funny. Two ladies women's dressing room the one who was actually working she was iirght the one at the counter dressing room was rude and watching the other lady work as she supervised I guess.

This place is ok. Besides the long wait in line. Not to mention when you ask one of the employees for help. Their ignore you and keep walking. Not to mention the receipt check as your walking out. Wow what happened to Wal-Marts great customer service like when they first open. Definitely not a place to go to if you you're in a hurry.< /Text>

Buena Park Mall Walmart is okay it's not the best Walmart but it's kind of a downside Walmart compared to others that I've been to they don't have a full grocery store departments but there is some things there they don't have a McDonald's anymore but it's not as dirty as the Anaheim one in my opinion so it's okay if you need groceries go to the one on beach and Lincoln that's the Walmart grocery store!<//review>

Just like most Walmart stores, well stocked, good prices but not good customer service. Workers there don't look so happy.
The only smiles you can find at this store are from Spectrum sales people who want you to switch your Internet service to their company.< /Text>

Huge Walmart, lot's of good stuff. The clothes looked vary nice, +plus there's a shopping mall next door with a REALLY COOL movie theater! Only downside to walmart was the crowd, but I was shopping at noon so what can I expect.< /Review>

The store is dirty and not very organized. The staff doesn't care about people wearing mask over their nose and mouth. Some of the staff did wear the mask as designed others didn't. Ask someone for help she continued working and didn't bother to look for the item all she said is if it's not in the shelf we don't have it. The item was on the top shelf of the overstock. Self checkout was quick but was not being cleaned like before with covid numbers on the rise.< /review>

For one I was told to change cashiers because the line I was in was going to lunch, and her register would lock her out, yet she was still checking out customers, that she wanted to (pull the cameras). I was in line almost 37 mins for 7 items, I couldn’t self check out because I had wine, I’m from the south, and I’ve never heard of such a thing that you have to go through a regular line if you have alcohol.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd2bd8ff75a859:0x7c8cccd268710dc</gmapID></record>

Affordable, lots of products. The lack of a star is due to Wal-Mart as a corporation and not paying living wages.</Review>

I didn't think bad customer service from custodial staff anywhere was ever possible, but I guess the sky's the limit at the Buena Park Walmart. I was waiting for my girlfriend to leave the restroom there and decided to use the other one, though it was apparently closed for cleaning. I clearly saw the custodian who blocked the entrance to it let another guy go through, but he wasn't willing to do the same with me. He then got unnecessarily irate when I tried using the empty women's restroom (my girlfriend confirmed she was the only one who used it) while the family restroom was "permanently locked". Not a good look at all for a store that was fine to me in all other areas.</Text>

<Text>Everything about this Walmart is great just except for two things. One of those things is how they have a lot of items locked up. And that's understandable except the problem is that when you push the button next to these items that it's supposed to get somebody to help you it literally can take up to 15 minutes. And then when you ask somebody that's walking by they say they'll get somebody for you but for some reason they can't help you themselves. Other than that the only other thing is that as with most stores like this do have 12 registers and only three open when there's a bunch of people. But that's kind of given nowadays with customer service at places like Walmart Target, Etc. So other than that this place is actually pretty good<//Text></record>

<review>Walmart overall is good but they have slow cashiers. There is always a line. One of thw problems I have with Walmart is if you need eye drop or something that is locked up it takes forever for someone to assist you, then thwy won't gibe you rhe product. You have either go pay for it right then. If you still have shopping to do, you will have let the cashier know that you have the eye drops.  The cashier will  then go get it. A lot of wasted time, not only for me but the cashier as well. I have been goin less and less. I prefer to pay the a little more than waste my time with this nonsense</review>< date>

I had not been to this location is YEARS and it's just very different now. They had really nothing that I wanted or needed. The employees were very nice and friendly though. The store was clean and organized but the selection seems bleak, random and scarce. Thank you.</text>

<Text>I've always been more of a Walmart shopper opposed to a Target shopper they have more affordable wider variety of grocery, men's women all ages & infant  sizes also. Shoes, electronics, house, Automotive, you made name you could call then a Convenient Store practically like 7 Eleven but much more Affordable with everyone's needs. Such as 1 of my favorite items of a box of 6 Chocholate Bavarian Custard 🍮 Cream donuts for $2.69 where as at B & B donuts. Charge: $1.35- for 1❗😳😣
Don't be ripped off, go that extra mine its woryh it all❗♓😎🤝🤘🤙💏☝🏻🏃✌🏻👄🙈🙉🙊👦👧👨🏻👩👵👱😻😸</Text>< pics>

An employee by the name."Warren" at the Buena Park Wal-Mart extremely rude.
I went to the store to buy a bicycle lock and a helmet some other guy came to help me, he was very helpful with everyone then he said I can bring your items to the sport register, then I asked him for padlocks and he directed me to the aisle I came back and he wasn't there I didn't see the items I left the padlock at the counter and walked away gew steps to see the outdoor sport items and wait for the clerk suddenly "Warren" walked towards the counter and took my padlock i went after him and I saw my other merchandise in a box, I grabbed them and placed on my shopping cart and I went to pickup the padlock, than he grabbed everything from cart and I said "excuse me" and he just kept walking away, ignoring me talking and he said I'm taking everything to the front, I asked him for a manager and he just ignored me i waited for another 15 minutes and he was passing by and I asked for my items and the manager he just said if you are looking for a manager he is at the front, I asked for his name and he just replied "Warren", I don't know if they are trained to assist customers or they just don't care about customer service.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I hate going to Walmart, but hate going here even more.

This particular location always has a dirty parking lot and pan handles.  You cannot get in and out of the store without being harassed.

Once inside, the store's items are always disorganized.  It just seems hectic and dirty.  The customer service is also miserable.  I asked one gentleman for the location of an item.  He just shrugged and walked away.

If you have to go to Walmart, don't go here.< /Review>

<review>I went to Walmart in Buena Park location today to buy backrest pillow because it was on sale only at this location and when I went there,  the price was not correct so I ask for the manager so I could get price matched but manager name Brittany came out and telling me all this bs story about online order only and couldn't price matched and I don't think she is fit to be a manager because she is rude and couldn't handle customers care kindly.  I think she should be fired at once. So I called the Walmart headquarters and reported her in. I went back to the store and ask for another floor manager and he (Noel) did it in one minute, no question ask. I wasted 30 minutes of my time calling headquarters and making a report on her (Brittany) . In the future if you need a manager don't talk with Brittany because she was so rude and don't know how to handle customers care.<//review>< time>

Under staffed, only 2 registers open at 8 P.M.. Self check line was 10+ deep just like the two registers. No one out on the floor to help with anything. More and more stuff in locked glass cases with no one to help you. Registers 8 and 10 only open. Store is going down hill.< /review>

<review>I like Walmart.  I really do.  The prices are low and the selection is great.  However, the associates are not knowledge about their products or where they are located.  I'm at an age where I want to get in and get out asap and if I get sent on a goose chase or have to look up the information that the associates should know on google, I'm not a happy camper.  This seems to be the case more often than not. A little training goes a long way.<//review></record>

<review>Came before 7, just after getting off of work. After waiting in line outside, I got in after 7, at about 710. Now they tell me they won't issue any money orders after 7. I understand there are COVID measures in place, but it's the 1st of the month, and I don't have my rent. The Customer Service Manager just stood there and said sorry, nothing I can do. I am a Customer Service Manager and sometimes you have to tell people no, but I was asking for them to give me free stuff, or open the entire store. What good is a manager that can't make a reasonable accommodation for a customer? A Walmart Manager, that's who.<//review>< rate>

Clean store and well-stocked. Easy checkout. Cashiers are very friendly but the stockers can moody - they definitely need to smile more, but they are helpful.< /review>

Under staffed, only 2 registers open at 8 P.M.. Self check line was 10+ deep just like the two registers. No one out on the floor to help with anything. More and more stuff in locked glass cases with no one to help you. Registers 8 and 10 only open. Store is going down hill.< /Text>

<text>Your manager Joseph should be ashamed of yourself how you turned away the seniors today on senior day with the store sign still up on the door & website. On top of it all your rudeness speaks volumes to the community of seniors that shop at your store. As a manager its your job to make sure people are informed even to be as lazy as checking the whats posted on a store you were chosen to manage.  Also you have been herd before saying  how you cant wait till senior day is gone. I hope Walmart hears this and cares better for the seniors in the community.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd2bd8ff75a859:0x7c8cccd268710dc<//gmapID></record>

Was at the Walmart in Buena Park, CA at the end of the Mall.  All the staff there were friendly and kind, the store appearance was impeccable. Found everything that My Mom needed all items were priced very reasonably. Left the store happy customers. 😊< /text>

The African American woman that works for Bronson security at this Walmart in Buena Park lacks in situation awareness, during the firework incident happened she didn’t handle the situation correctly. She had no crowd control and all she did was shake and scream had no composure didn’t help at all she should be fired and every time I come in she’s on her phone I feel unsafe having her around<//Text>

Would have been a no star. But the supervisor Rusty made it better. Though, he was still knowegable of the original associates lack of customer service.</Review>

<Text>Wouldn't let me in because I didn't have a face mask. I asked the guard to provide me one I will pay you. He's like "No, go somewhere else". So apparently people who can't find a face mask or can't afford it, they are banned from Walmart. Even though wearing a mask is not mandatory according to the health department.<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<Text>It's crowded due to the curfew and covid-19. Ppl aren't necessarily being jerks but there's just so many of them. Some items are out of stock or not being replenished so the shelves are empty especially cleaning supplies. The parking lot is a zoo! What a pain in the neck. Good luck if you're in a hurry. If you don't need alot of stuff, you can usually do fine using self check out.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

It was Alright. Except that the security guards will stop people that are shopping and harass them, while the people  stealing dont get harasss. GOOD LORD. A the employee's are extremely  rude theres maybe about 2 or 3 employee's  doing a great job. Overall  that place sucks.< /text>

The parking here is CRAZY. But...the store is amazing. I love that Walmart is carrying my organic brands in there health area. Auromere is a brand a hope they carry soon. Thanks again for everything Walmart, your the best as usual.< /Review>

Very bad customer service,  we asked two employees to assist to find pancake batter N both had unpleasant additives, gave us wrong row number nd didn't offer to walk us to item. Third employee said he thought it was on aisle 10 but walked us there to reassure him self and us...<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80dd2bd8ff75a859:0x7c8cccd268710dc<//gmapID><review>Another truck driver and I had an arrangement with the manager here. We haul shows in to Anaheim regularly.  We have trucks with custom sleepers and so we are completely self contained. Since the manager was considerate enough to let us park here when in town, we would always use the facility to restock our supplies and groceries, usually spending between $300 - $400. Tonight I was awakened by security and informed that the manager said he had no knowledge of any arrangement.  Needless to say, they won't be getting any more of our money. There are too many other grocery stores that I'm sure would treasure our business.<//review>< Time>

I like Walmart because it's convenient for me to shop for clothes and groceries. And, it's affordable there's even a McDonalds inside. So, I have some coffee maybe a snack before going around  to do my shopping.<//Text>

The layout here is truly not user friendly, whenever I'm there I feel like a rat in a maze.
If you need at item that is locked up be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for assistance. If an item is locked up why doesn't the person working that department not have a key?
I rarely shop there unless it's the only store that has the item I need.</review>

This place is pretty close to my house. But sometimes the parking is terrible. I don't know why they changed the handicap parking formation, but they did, and not for the better. They've got some really ridiculous formations for handicapped people to park in, I don't get it but I guess I'm not supposed to. And they changed the store around a long time ago, and I don't like the flow of the store. Things that should be together are not. Employees here don't know where anything is and they always send you in the wrong direction at least two to three times! Another ridiculous thing. I actually choose to go up to the Westminster Walmart if I need to go to a larger Walmart. It's attached to the Buena Park Mall , so there's other places, stores, and eateries to go to besides Walmart. As well as lots of restaurants in the parking lot.< /review>

This particular Wal-Mart is always so congested. The employees are around bit never really appear willing to help, when asked a question. I came here w my daughter. She tried getting assistance from an employee. They brushed her off and treated her like a child.  She is 22 years old. Not all bad there were some really nice happy looking employees as well.< /Review>

Came in to quickly grab a few things to go swiming at our hotel.  Shirts rang up at the wrong price and the cashier was obviously in a hurry to go to lunch and rang up an item 3 times that we had 2 of she was short and rude her name was destiney.  Then we ask for manager named mariana who also was very rude who directs US to customer service in the line this whole ordeal took more than 20 monies the employees were rude and the manager was more rude never will i come back here!!! If i could give 0 starts i would!!</Review>

<Text>I called to see if they had glowsticks leftover from Halloween(they were 50%off). Guy said they had some & hung up. I went anyways and found some. They had 2 different packs with different color  glowsticks. I went thru self checkout & paid.
I went to the optical department to get clip on sunglasses.  Only one guy there looking at paperwork. I found something that might fit my glasses and had to go get his attention for advice.  He said I can open the package and see if they fit. He recommended a larger size. I found one I wanted to purchase, but he was with a customer.  So I checked out the other styles (I think he said framless at one point, but those didn't look as durable) for the same price. Now I'm ready to purchase and he's not very attentive, looking at the frames and the customers were looking elsewhere. So I had to go to him again and told him I wanted to buy the clip ons. After my purchased I was gathering the glowsticks and noticed I only got one of the multi-colored packs instead of two. Then another optical employee came out and asked if he could help me...where was he 10 minutes ago?
I went back to the self checkout to see if I could swap out one of packs for the multicolored one. They said I had to go to returns to exchange them. So I did.
What a hassle to get some glowsticks and clip on Sunglasses at a decent price!< /Text>< response>

I can't knock it. It's a full sized Walmart. Prices are great and so is the selection.

Sorry I did not take any pictures while I was there. You'll have to just imagine it..< /text>

Absolutely horrible service in the auto care center. Came to get a new battery installed in my car and was told it would take an hour but it took almost two hours or more. While I waited for my car the service was horrible! I asked what was taking so long and the gal told me that they were on a break very rudely. I have never been to a auto service center like this one, do not come here. I gave one star for the price because it was fair.<//Text>

<review>I bought A Television from this location on March 2nd 2018 and when I made the purchase the person ringing me up offered me a protection plan which I instantly declined but after this person insisted I should get it just in case my screen were to somehow crack then it would most definitely cover that. So I purchase this 3 year protection plan for $69. Just last night I mounted my television for the first time, and it happened, my screen cracked on the bottom right corner and completely ruining the pixels. I filed a claim and find out that this 3 year plan I was persuaded to buy by the cashier at Walmart did not cover my television. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!! I’m beyond disappointed that In order to up-sale these protection plans they lie about what these protection plans cover. Now $ 698 dollars down the drain plus $69 dollars of a worthless plan. Walmart you should most definitely train your cashiers better.<//review>< username>

Why were all the handicap spaces taken out? They put up three parallel parking for the handicapped directly  in front  of the stores opening but I've watched many PPL having a difficult time parking in there. Not to mention of course  if they were painted the way they used to be and should be  you could probably get  at least five more cars in there also a couple rows down they added orange spaces for picking up parking mdse spaces. I have yet to see anybody use it they still pull up to the front of the store to load up mdse.
So what is needed is more handicap spaces please. I bent over 40 minutes driving around to find a space to park and there were people parked in the three parallel parking spot with no tags and no handicap sign.</Text>< pics>

There is NO PRODUCE SECTION at this store location. They have 2 or 3 end caps with maybe some bagged tomatoes, bananas, potatoes and carrots IF they do. There is a Neighborhood Walmart less than a mile away on Beach Blvd and Lincoln Ave that has a good size produce section but the customer service there is horrific.<//Review>

<review>Typical Walmart but is placed beside a mall which is neat. Has anything you could need since it is a super center. Has an indoor Mcdonald for those hungry while shopping. Would recommend to those who need some groceries or anything really..</review><Date>1529091529110<//Date>< user>

This Walmart has too many everyday items behind glass cases. Don't go here if you don't want to ask for assistance getting EYE DROPS.  Also don't go here if you're looking to get a particular item, because they'll probably be out of stock.< /review>

<review>BP walmart is always busy, closes at 11 pm due to the demographics, has a full super market and nursery and full service tire and maintenece center in the back.  This is a super store but a small one.  They are convenient and most of the time the service is friendly and the store is clean.  They dont have huge clearance racks like some super store but they do have a mc donalds and a optic center and pharmacy inside<//review>< Pics>

I mean what can you say about Walmart. This one is a little less crowded than some others.  Restrooms were a little gross, employees seemed above the Walmart curve, and I was a little bummed they didn't have any electric blankets. So like yeah Walmart.</text>

<review>It's Walmart! As far as Walmart's go, it's relatively clean (though the bathroom was so so), but it was still early. I generally prefer going early, before it gets busy, but I found myself shopping with the several homeless people who desperately needed bathing (but they gotta eat too, now I know where they shop).<//review><Date>1551699596873< /Date>< rate>

This place is always so busy.  You need to stalk people to find parking.  Good thing is that they have the garden center entrance and there are usually closer parking once you past that further east.  Also, when checking out try the HBA check-out if you don't have anything that needs to be weighed or something special.  Another plus is that they're usually stocked where other stores in the area would lack.</review>

i didnt catch her name, but she was an older lady who is probably rude 24/7. walmart is the worst in customer service. never anyone at their station to help and if you do find someone, they will aggressively tell you its not their area and you should look fir someone else. unless they tell you they go find someone at the back and disappear for 10 minutes only to reappear and tell you someone else will help you. terrible customer service in almost every department.<//text>

<Text>Wal-Mart pretty much always has what I need.

It's only failure is not having a wired backup camera.  The wireless constantly gets interference or doesn't turn on at all.  I counted and 67 times out of 100 it failed.  Totals are 24 no signal, 43 intermittent/interference, 33 good reception.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
This closer to 1.5 stars! LET ME BE CLEAR- THIS STORE STRAIGHT SUCKS!!!! The fact that the store brand"Great Value" hardly ever seems to be in stock- for soda,soap,cereals,etc! It was the main reason I came to this store,and being at the mall, I thought the products I was looking for would've been here. The shelves were a mess- cereal aisle/section was only about 8 feet long and boxes were scattered & knocked over. Soda almost the same and the icing on the cake was the "express" 10 items or less lane. The young man was doing his best but seemed like no one wanted to relieve him so eventhough the rope was up to close the ONLY LINE FOR CIGARETTES he kept going. Even with an ignorant customer who had a shopping cart full of items that came up to damn near $200, he kept a smile on his face & did his job and served us until his relief finally decided to show up. Wal-Mart you need to correct the glaring deficiencies this  location has been experiencing for some time. For me this is the last straw and I will not shop this store unless I'm tricked or dragged to it!!!< /Review>

The Buena Park Walmart staff was great. Household prices were also good. I wouldn't advise shopping for groceries at this Walmart. Go to one of the Walmart Neighborhood Markets or the Walmart superstore at the Long Beach Town Center off of Carson if you are looking for groceries. They will have much better selections. This location's grocery selection seemed like an after thought that got squeezed in. Parking was fine. Good christmas displays and nice selection of stocking stuffers.< /Review>

<review>First of all I could not believe how much the toilet paper was out! Then I went to get latex gloves for my client because we need them when we clean the bathroom and those were wiped out! Luckily I found some toilet paper to buy for the client. I wish this store had more groceries but nope I have to go stater bros to finish off her grocery shopping.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd2bd8ff75a859:0x7c8cccd268710dc< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>Normally I don't have that bad of an experience here but one employee named Ata was horrible. He was working at customer service and I needed a money order for 1,000 he kept saying 4,000. I told him multiple times the correct amount but he rang it up. When I told him the amount was wrong before I paid,  he proceeded to argue with me because he needed to void the transaction. Then he started arguing with his manager about my request. He even asked me if my card would be able to go through. Very rude. Luckily his manager Terri was polite and took care of the issue. He should not be at this counter.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Waited twenty minutes for cigarettes. Only one line you can buy them, ask four people for help. They all told me they were calling, the manager. Finally here comes the manager, he was so rude. Told him I wanted cigarettes, he said this line closed, I replied, then where would you like me to buy them. I spent $244.00 in the store. Told him, it was bad management, seven people left, got tired of waiting. You should always have someone in there, and the sports area. To bad he had such an attitude, went go back there.<//Review>< pics>

America has a "Love/Hate" relationship with Walmart!

We love low prices but hate low quality products. Love cheap stuff but hate to admit we shop at Walmart!

We need a support group...

Dont get me wrong this used to be my favorite walmart and i used to work there but yesterday as i was returning items one of the associates was very rude throwing the returns at me telling me they were on the receipts i had and being very rude to me. Talked to the manager and i know nothing was done. Wish they would though cause this one has some good associates.</text>

I always have a good experience even though a lot of times they are short-handed but the people are still very customer service oriented. When you come to return something or exchange their extremely helpful even if you lost your receipt they can look it up through your Walmart app.</text>

I really like this location a lot. It's one of the bigger facilities that I've seen since I've been out on the West Coast. More like what I'm used to. It has a wider variety of items and a better selection than all the other walmarts that I've been to out here so far.<//text>

This is 1 of the more disappointing Wal-Mart's to go to. The parking is atrocious,items usually in stock can never be found at this store and they don't even carry the store brand (Great Value) most of the time-soda,pop tarts,pop corn,body soap, to name a few. The manager of the store should be demoted or have more training to keep customers happy,but I guess that person gets let off the hook because there's 2 more Wal-Mart's within 3 miles.<//review>

Poorly trained support staff...  Called Buena Park Walmart for a stock check, the person who answered the phone says she doesn't have a computer in front of her so she can't do it.  Then she asked me to wait and put me on hold for 30min and let the phone ring.  Went to the store to check it myself, but they closed the entire garden dept because it's raining. Won't let me buy or even check it myself.  Wow...< /review>

Very limited in their store stock esp food.  There is a WalMart Fresh Food Market  down by Lincoln and Beach but there is no excuse. If ppl comes here and are looking  for fresh food they should be able to find what they are looking for without going to another store

Can never find help but what's new. That's typically WalMart. The workers here r extremely rude and downright condescending. You would think in a tourist town they would be nice.

The pics on this site are very old. No fresh food area at all which surprised me as other WalMarts carry fresh fruit, vegetables, etc but not this one.  Aldis is across the street but you shouldn't have to go elsewhere if that's why you came to this store.

There is a McDonald's inside but that is to change soon.< /text>

Then went to the register and the cashier won't accept my formula check because she said it didn't match the picture. I argued with her that it said "any products from Enfamil" but she still said it had to be in the picture. She called the manager and once it took five minutes to wait for the manager, I said forget it and left. I can't deal with slow and incompetent workers from Walmart anymore.</text>< Pics>

This is our favorite Walmart. The staff are friendly, especially the one in crafts and sewing section! I have found what I wanted for my crafts 99% of the time and I keep returning. Walmart has a great selection and when you enter any store, you have that "deja vu" feeling!</Text>

This place really has gone down hill. There is junk everwhere and a lot of homeless roaming the store. I tried to return something and the Customer Service ladies were rude to my family. Unprofessional on their phones and talking about their personal life. Even though there was a line.  Find another store. This place is dirty and their staff is unprofessional.< /review>

This walmart is a nice store I stop here when I'm in the area and they have what I'm needing.  I prefer going to other walmarts most of the time as this store shrunk most of there departments and they are never fully stocked.
I use an electric cart to move around the store as I have a bad back and cannot stand nor do a lot of walking on concrete floors. This store only has 3 electric carts and there's usually 3 or 4 people waiting for 1 to become available.<//Text>

I give this store 0 stars. This is a disgrace to all WALMARTS!!!! I went to go pick up something, it took 20 minutes until someone came to assist. So many employees were going in and out of the back doors,  in the area, only 3 tried to look for someone, but none of them tried to help us. But the most disappointing thing was, that the janitor was the one truly helping us, he got one the employees attention and told him that we had been waiting there for a long time and we needed assistance. And then he said I will tell the front desk, and then finally the manager came to assist us.They should very much change the pick up station, this has happen to me twice.<//review>

< review>
Horrible/non existant customer service on behalf of two particular people in the store. My bf and I came into walmart an hour before closing and were waiting around the jewelry department asking the other associates who were nearby to call for their coworker who had access to some of the rings I wanted to try on (btw both the manager and the associate in charge of that department were called 5 different times. Pretty excessive and ridiculous if you ask me). Unfortunately we waited over 25min (10 when we first got to the department and another 15 or so after waiting around for someone to show up) for either Sara the manager and/or Claire the associate assigned to that department. I understand that alot of employees and managers wanna wrap things up because it is nearing the end of closing up for the night, but that is no excuse for neglecting your job duties because you are still on the clock until 11pm exactly. Not 10-10:45pm. And I've never heard of a 25 min break before closing so no one can use that as excuse either. So long story short we left unsatisfied and quite frankly annoyed because it was obvious that we were being ignored by those two in particular who clearly did not feel like fulfilling their job duties until the very end of their shift. Everyone else who was either walking by or was in a nearby department was very friendly and willing to help and we definitely appreciated it.<//review>

This is honestly the best Walmart I've ever been to, or at least that I can remember. I live in the Bay Area in Oakland and the Walmarts there are horrible, absolutely horrible! Long lines, messy stores, they don't restock the shelves, no variety of items, etc, etc. But, this Walmart is clean, the items on the shelves look perfectly placed (like the shelves stay untouched), they have great variety, the atmosphere is open and peaceful.... Literally, I'm looking around and every aisle looks neat and organized. It's like a Target in a nice neighborhood. :) Even there's staff walking around helping people... and they're polite and friendly. The workers at Bay Area stores are young people with bad attitudes and little professionalism. I'm sure people around here are complaining because they have no idea how good they have it. I've lived in Oakland, Seattle, Kansas City, Chicago, and been many other places. Most Walmarts I've been to are an embarrassment to the company. Walmart Corporate should force those other store managers to visit this Walmart and learn from whoever manages this store. I feel so frustrated with Walmart in general, so this place is a breath of fresh air! Well done Buena Park Walmart!< /text>

NEVER BUY FISH FROM WALMART-
i work nearby and i noticed that they sell fish so one day i go in to buy 2 fish , mind you before purchasing them i asked my sales associate if the fish needed anything besides the Neutralized water and they told me that I can use the same thing I use with my beta fish and then I asked if I needed a filter and if a 1 gallon tank was big enough. So they told me that everything would be fine with a 1 gallon tank with no filter needed and just to continue using the neutralizer that I use for my beta fish at home. The same day only a few hours later one of the fish died,  neutralized water and they told me that I can use the same thing I use with my beta fish and then I asked if I needed a filter and if a 1 gallon tank was big enough. So they told me that everything would be fine with a 1 gallon tank with no filter needed and just to continue using the neutralizer that I use for my beta fish at home. The same day only a few hours later one of the fish died so i took it back to get a new one , next morning the other fish that was originally bought is now on its sides fighting for air - long story short i was given the wrong information and not only did one of my fishes die but the other almost did , thankfully i called petco and they talked me through getting his pulse steady and told me to put salt in the water to help him breathe . These people are allowing their customers to buy living fish to give false information that cause a death and 1 near , thankfully i caught him in time and now my 2 fish seem to be fine but this walmart should seriously make sure that whom ever goes to sell fish knows what they are talking about and doesn’t just give false info , as i am sure i am not the only person that has dealt with this and all the fishes that have probably died due to the same reason . i am going to corporate about this issue and hopefully make sure that they only have real , trained , experienced fish experts giving information about the fish and selling the fish , if they don’t know how to properly do the job , which involves giving correct information to the consumer than they simply don’t need to be working in that department and or they could have just told me that they didn’t know<//Review>

McDonald's visit wasn't  the best yet it's  always my daughters place to go. However Walmart is always our place to go for all our shopping.  The lines might be long but it's  a family  thing we all take that trip.<//Review>

<text>Since it is the only Wallmart that is close, we frequent this location often. They did a "remodel " a while back. We did not see much of a improvement. The cold cerial isle is pretty pathetic. Now when we really need to do any heavy shopping, we go to a superwalmart. Then we are assured pretty much of a more complete shopping experience.<//text><GmapID>0x80dd2bd8ff75a859:0x7c8cccd268710dc</GmapID></record>

Only bad thing is that the loss prevention guy was trying to hit on me while i was shopping but theyre alright. Only one employee stands out to me tho and her name is Adrienne and shes a tall african american woman with short hair and she ALWAYS makes cashing my check a pleasant and joyful experience! So friendly and outgoing! I love her!< /Review>

The food variety is lacking, but you can easily find the common stuff. It's never empty, there's always people shopping here.
Closes early, around ten or eleven, since it isn't a 24-hour Walmart.<//review>< user_id>

It takes over 30 min for 3 people because tgmhe lady behind the counter works as slow as humanly possible and the refuse to add another associate even when the line is long. Just unacceptable..

Parking is a problem, especially if you want to park near Walmart, it would be hard to find a spot during weekend and evening. I normally park near Sears and walk down to Walmart.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>In a nut shell it's like most stores in the area… go during the week when the masses of rudy, sloppy customers aren't here.

During the week this place is quiet, and clean with well stocked shelves. On the weekend it's a completely different store! But only because of the customers that tear this place apart from top to bottom!

I've been shopping here since they opened about 10 years ago. I wouldn't go on the weekends unless it's right when the store opens, trust me!</Text></record>

<review>Made an online order for my wife and I; two pairs of luggage around 11:45am today, waited about almost four hrs for a conformation by email or txt. Nothing.

I called the store around 3:35pm, and was transferred twice; luckily the lady who helped me with the transfer between departments was very nice. I was trying to reach the pick up department, however twice I called this department only to have the phone picked up and immediatly afterwards hang up on me.

On the third call, a male associate answered. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the associate only that his named started with  an H.

I had inquired the associate about my online order how it's been four hours already, no confirmation by txt or email for two suties cases. I was baffled by the associates attitude, and lack of customer service.

He had told me that my order had been ready since 12pm. Not only was my time wasted but I was treated with a very apathetic associate with very poor customer service skills. I was given no apology, and told to just pick it up.

As a person who works in retail myself, I felt very upset on how this situation was handled. Funny that after I made my call that all of a sudden I got the txt and email that my order was ready.

Picking up was a different story, I want to thank the department Manger Hector for his empathy, and time to hear me out on my experience. I wish I could provide a full name of the associate who poorly handled the situation so Hector can correct this behavior.

Other than that, I'm probably not gonna order from this store again.<//review>< Pics>

The employees that they have at their door to greet people are very rude, not welcoming at all. Everytime I'm here, the young girls are always "high key" flirting with the other employees, not doing their job and making fun of the customers.
The people at the returns section of the store always have trouble with their transactions, whether it's an item return, a money order or just cashing out a check, they cant seem to get it done, its kind of upsetting to go to this section of the store because the line is long and they only have one person.
The employees that they have around the store hate helping the customers. I was looking for some eyeliner a couple months ago and there was a female employee just testing out the nail polish on her nails, and an older lady walked up to her and asked if she spoke spanish, the girl didnt respond and tried to ignore her and all the lady wanted to know was where the lotion was.
Too many of the employees walk in groups around the store and it just feels weird.</text>

< review>
Needed an item that was locked in a glass cabinet in the automotive department.  first guy told me "Jim has the key, he already went home" second guy "I'll get somebody to help you" third guy "I'll call somebody else right now to help you" fourth guy "did anybody help you yet"? Fifth guy " I can go get the key" 10 minutes ,15 minutes, got the supcase open! waited longer than 20 minutes for this whole ordeal!. call because Jim has the only key and he went home. unbelievable!!!Im always hearing about Walmart employees deserving more pay. they underpaid. I don't know about that, could be up for discussion!< /review>

What can I say....it's Wal-Mart. It has a McDonalds in there in case you get hungry or thirsty and it has all kinds of imported stuff from China for you to buy. The parking here sucks and you usually have to park on the far side of the parking lot. It's no big deal if you don't mind walking.<//review>

<Review>To the gentleman who wrote about being immaturely ridiculed in the parking lot because of his "baller" jacket, I sympathize with you as I've had expriences that fall into the same standard. While I understand that expecting much from Walmart in terms of customer service is rather silly, I still find it inexcusable and sad that so many of the customer service employees lack basic respect, etiquette and manners. I wish that I could get paid by Walmart to go undercover and expose the many reasons that potential customers go once and rarely return... Especially considering the simplicity of the solution to the problem. Even the managers lack fundamental respect. I won't be returning to this Walmart for sure - maybe I'll try a different location but I doubt it.<//Review><Rate>2<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I called to see if a certain game was available and was transferred to electronics 4 times. Each time no one answered and it took a total of 10mins before the lady realized no one was answering... She finally sent me to an operator who was kind enough to page the guy for me. Electronics guy finally answers and informs me the game is not available. Wasted 16mins of my time. I will not be returning to this branch again.</review>

<Review>The employees at Walmart are ok, but the management company has the police and security approach you to tell you that you are loitering should you decide to eat your newly purchased lunch and use your cellphone for awhile, I've shopped at this Walmart for awhile now, I think it's time for me to let Walmart go or should I say mart-law go, and spend my money AND time somewhere else.</Review>< time>

<review>Don't come to this Walmart to often, bad experience on two different occasions.  I happen to be in the area today, so stopped because I had a return.    This particular Walmart is in a very busy shopping center close to Knotts, knowing how the parking is,  I parked n the back because of the opening in the garden center.   I go inside, the lady (Gina) asked if I had a return,  I said yes, thinking she was going to put a sticker on my item,  (like they do at all the other Walmart's) nope,  she told me I had to go thru the front.   I told her I'm not going thru the front n kept walking. She ran past me yelling,  telling me it was policy n she wished I would listen to store policy.  She made a huge scene and got other employees involved all which sided with her to the point where it was too embarrassing to even stay there.  I had a receipt and they treated me like I was going to terrorize that store. Why is there parking,  doors, and check outs in the garden center?  Is that not for customers coming in going out of the store?  Store policy?   Where is it posted that customers with returns can only enter thru the front doors of the store?   Very inconvenient for customers and for Gina to have behaved and acted in such an embarrassing manner was pretty bad. I had my receipt and they treated he like I was going to terrorize that store.  If anything,  she could have explained to me that there was such a policy and to remember that for the next time and let it be, but to actually think that it was ok to send a customer out of the store and make them go thru a different entry is and was absolutely ridiculous.  So I ended up leaving and  going to another Walmart and to avoid the hassle, I parked by the front doors.   I asked the supervisor that helped me if there was a store policy on which doors customers with returns can go thru,  she looked at me like I was crazy.  I told her what happened and she couldn't believe that and said they don't have a policy like that there.   I could say, I would never shop  there again,  but we all know Walmart is a huge company, me threatening them to lose my business is just like stepping on an ant, a lot more ants around to miss one.  They won't notice If I do or do not shop there.  My story is told and I will try my hardest to avoid that Walmart in Buena Park on La Palma close to Knotts.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>This is the WORST walmart I have ever been to ! The customer service sucks !! The employees need to be trained on product knowledge as well as the ASM Sue ... I NEVER understood why people boycotted Walmart until visiting this store !! Target you have earned a new customer Walmart you lost a couple because I will make sure that my family and friends boycott Walmart as well</review>< Pics>

Since last years store change to new layout..they don't stock a LOT of general items that I used to go there for.  Today an 18 pack of eggs was 1.44 but they didn't have any..however they had two 18 packs for $4.90...where is the savings in that?<//Text>

Everytime I come to this Wal-Mart I have a lot of problems. Starting with parking, poor customer service skills, never has any of the advertised sale items, and will never cash my checks but other Wal-Marts in the area will.Would recommend that everyone go to any other Wal-Mart.< /Text>

Parking is impossible at this location, staff is not very efficient.  Very dirty store.  It is the closest Walmart to my house, but I try and avoid it as much as possible.< /Text>

They let their employees work while they're sick, spreading the flu.

This place is such a joke I called 3 times in a row to ask what time customer service stays open until. Each time I was hung up on so rude Walmart is truly going down the drain . Lost a loyal customer for sure !!!!</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The manager of this store has simply decided not to make returns without a receipt ... when in all walmarts there is no major problem in giving you a credit store. But a non-Hispanic person ahead of me was given a credit store without a receipt ... apparently the Asian manager that I touch does not like Hispanics. You are human and you can lose receipts.

<text>(Translated by Google) IT IS OK THE PLACE, WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THAT THEY ARE CHECKING THE THINGS AT THE DEPARTURE. I BELIEVE Q FOR THAT THEY HAVE CAMERAS AND ALARMS. THAT'S WHY I LIKE MORE TARGET BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO THAT. THANK YOU

(Original)
ESTA BIEN EL LUGAR , LO Q NO ME GUSTA ES Q LE ESTEN CHECANDO LAS COSAS A LA SALIDA. CREO Q PARA ESO TIENEN CAMARAS Y ALARMAS . POR ESO ME GUSTA MAS TARGET PORQUE ELLOS NO HACEN ESO . GRACIAS< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) As usual in Walmart, the place is mostly organized ... full of products that are mostly available in the rest of the branches .. service is medium to bad in quality and speed staff respond to questions, inquiries and requests for help .. good hygiene .. the place is crowded in the middle of the day and on holidays significantly. Car parking spaces are available and many and rarely used all .. In addition to places for people with special needs of course .. Inside there are clean bathrooms and equipped for the use of mothers and infant children ..

(Original)
كعالدة في وولمارت المكان منظم في اغلبه.. ممتلئ بالمنتجات التي يتوفر غالبها في بقية الفروع.. الخدمة متوسطة الي سيئة في جودتها وسرعه استجابة العاملين للأسئله والاستفسارات وطلبات المساعدة.. النظافة جيدة.. المكان مزدحم في وسط اليوم وفي ايام العطلات بشكل ملحوظ.. اماكن انتظار السيارات متاحة وكثيرة ونادرا ما تستخدم كلها.. بالاضافة الي اماكن ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة بالطبع.. بالداخل يوجد حمامات نظيفة ومجهزة لاستخدام الامهات والاطفال الرضع..</Review>

(Translated by Google) The store is very dirty, the clothes are thrown on the floor, the employees are very rude as well as the cashiers, the cashiers feel they own Walmart and feel they have the right to offend one with their attitude, I'm too racist, they shouldn't be plateaus, it seems that we are in an immigration agency with his attitude he did not return to this Walmart in good park

(Original)
Muy sucia la tienda la ropa tira en el suelo los empleados muy groceros al igual que las cajeras, las cajeras se siente dueñas de Walmart y se siente con el derecho de ofender a uno con su actitud soy demasiado racistas no deberían ser mesetas  parece que estamos en una agencia de emigración con su actitud no regresó a esta Walmart de buena park<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The problem was not the store, but rather McDonald's, all its staff is racist and gives very bad customer service. Even when the encangada she did not do anything to solve the problem, she only made fun of and ignored her. What courage, give Pena. I am and have worked as a manager in very good restaurant chain companies and neither I do or allow that behavior to my employees. Anyway, I have not yet mentioned what the problem was and I will not say it but if I can say that they have a disastrous staff, I would have attended the situation in less than a minute and more if I do not have more clients around me and more If I have helpers behind me not being busy. But now I see that in certain Mc's !!!! They have no priority because the customer is happy, what a bad policy !!!!

(Original)
El problema no fue de la tienda, si no mas bien del McDonal's, todo su personal es racista y da muy mal servicio al cliente. Aun estando la encangada ella no hiso nada para solucionar el problema, solo se burlo y se hiso la desentendida. Que coraje, dan Pena. Yo soy y he trabajado de manager en muy buenas compañias de cadenas de restaurantes y ni yo hago o permito esa conducta a mis empleados. En fin, aun no he mencionado cual fue el problema y no pienso decirlo pero si puedo decir que tienen un personal Nefasto, yo en lo perdonal en menos de un minuto hubiese atendido la situacion y mas si no tengo mas clientes a mi alrededor y mas si tengo ayudantes detras mio no estando ocupados. Pero ahora ya veo que en ciertos Mc's!!!! No tienen prioridad porque el cliente se valla contento, Que politica tan Mala!!!!< /Text>
