< Review>
I was not expecting this small restaurant tucked away in an obscure retail center to have such great sushi!  Portions were fresh, tasty and generous.  I ordered take out and everything was scrumptious.  Highly recommend if you are in Redding!</Review>

Really really good! Nice to had a new place to go on this end of town! The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. I was happy to see the prices were reasonable- hope they stay that way. For a small place, it was busy and didn't seem crowded and loud. I remember the owner from another popular Japanese place in town and he knows what he's doing! Nicely decorated, clean and very well staffed. Can't wait to go back and try something new! I went with some old fav's since my date was buying and she didn't like going out on a limb and trying anything new. Nice place!<//review>

Eggs rolls: 1/5. Nothing like egg rolls. Over fried.
Miso: 3/5. Just wasn’t great, but not terrible.
Calamari: 1/5. Tasted like chewy fish sticks.
Philadelphia roll: 2/5. Room temperature cream cheese and salmon. I would expect it to be chilled at a minimum.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

It's a small size family owned restaurant. The owner was formerly a sushi chef at Tokyo Garden. The sushi was great. We ordered California rolls, Shrimp Tempura rolls, Mountain Dew roll, Jasmine rolls, a Philly roll, and Unagi nigiri. The wait was pretty long, but overall the customer service and food was great. It would have been nice if we had been informed of the wait time, however, the host and hostess were both very nice and apologizing for the wait. Will be back in the future.< /text>

<Review>It was amazing food. I love how they make edamame. It was just really slow and not very much room for seating. We had to sit outside and it was cold. It wasn't their fault though, proud just wanted to sit and enjoy themselves.<//Review><UserId.>114028988645926833174</UserId.>< Time>

The spicy edamame where great. The sashimi was not too thin. And our rolls where mmmmmMMMMM GOOOOD.
Great service. Reasonably priced. Lovely ambiance. And most importantly very clean.</Text>

The best sushi around. Amazing consistency for any restaurant but especially for a sushi place. Large rolls, plenty of fish, good rice/ratio. Very tasty and fresh as well.  Very nice and accommodating staff. Lee the sushi chef is cool and has a genuine passion for food.</text>

I had the Mountain Dew roll without the masago since I’m not a fan of texture. It was so good! On  point and it was filling. Definitely coming back, my friend and I only had so much time and the service was quick! The inside is cute too! I’ve been wanting to try this place and I’m glad that I finally had the chance to. Thanks team you guys did great!<//Review>

awesome service and the food is always fresh and ready on time. the salad, and  dressing they use that come as an appetizer is amazing. not to sure what it is but it has a touch of sweet to it that definitely compliments everything very well.<//text>

<review>Worst experience from an owner ever before in my life. So I have had two horrible experiences at this location now. First time I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The first time was about 1 month ago. I had put in an order for a pick up and they told me 45 mins my order will be done. So I showed up 5 mins early. I wouldn’t mind waiting 5 minutes. But instead. I waited 1 whole hour. 1 whole hour just sitting there waiting while the owner made everyone else’s order before mine. Even people who came in after me to order got their food before me.
So I decided to give them a try again today June 10 2020. I called at 4pm. And learning from my past mistake I thought I would call ahead of time to give them time to make my order Incase they are busy. So I called and told them 5:40pm I’ll be there. I showed up 5:40pm on the dot. I Went in and paid first. Turns out my food wasn’t ready yet. I was ok with waiting a bit. I stepped out and came back 20 minutes later. Still. My order wasn’t ready. Turns out they hasn’t even started it till I got there. So I decided to ask for a refund. I told the worker I had called in at 4pm. Instead of getting a I’m sorry or something to explain the delay. This is the owners response. Do not bother us anymore. I was dumbfounded. I felt assaulted. Here I am having my time wasted. Waiting for my food again. while other customers who ordered after me got their food before me again. Horrible customer service!!! Worst owner experience ever!!!!!< /review><username>Toca_ Star< /username><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x54d2eb0e8ee16325:0xeae8a70e88edbbc2</gmapID>< userid>

Bonsai is an excellent place to get your sushi fix. Lee is an incredibly talented chef, the fish is fresh, the service is friendly, the prices are great, and the restaurant has an enjoyable, quaint feel to it.<//review>

One of the Hidden gems of Redding area. If you like your sushi and a lot then Bonsai is the  place to go.

Always check the special board but my go-to is the Churn Creek roll!<//text>

My mom had the #2 bento box, the beef was tender and the tempura vegetables were cooked to perfection. My husband & I shared the 15 pieces of sashimi along with the bonsai roll. It was all simply delicious. We will definitely be back. The interior decor was nice and the staff was helpful & kind!</review>< Pictures>

The sushi itself was to die for. The lacking in a star is due to the waiter. Waiter was slow and unresponsive.  Taking food and drink orders took forever and our drinks were endlessly empty.  With that said worth it. The chef if that's what you call the sushi person was awesome!</text>

Searched online for the closest sushi to Cottonwood as I was craving sushi (rolling the dice, I know) but everything from the phone call to place a pick up order and the location in south Redding, to the ambiance inside and the customer service I received from start to finish, it was all AMAZING. But most importantly, the sushi was SO, SO GOOD!!! I will definitely be coming back soon.</Review>

Great tasting,high quality sashimi. I ordered the red snapper, tuna, salmon sashimi and I really enjoyed it.  I also ordered one of the fusion rolls called the Mountain Dew, It was delicious! I really liked the food overall.  Service was not bad,  but the wait staff was very busy on Friday night! The building gets warm due to the orientation to the sun, and large windows.  The atmosphere is typical of the contemporary Japanese food restaurant, not a lot of seating in the dining room. Lots of people seem to order for takeout.</review>

Sushi was inventive and delicious. Smaller, more personable restaurant which I love. Price was fair for the quality. 4 stars because it did take longer than desire to get the sushi but once I tasted it I didn't mind the wait so much. Thank you for a pleasant night out<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is a review of the classics,  the California roll is delicious and so is the salad, I love the peanut sauce that’s on the salad.  All of the fish is fresh, I would also recommend the Maui Zowie it has only fresh fish, vegetables, and pineapple sauce.  Lastly, I would definitely recommend the spicy tuna roll though it is spicy it’s delicious, all the food here is bursting with flavors, the employees are great and they are always smiling.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x54d2eb0e8ee16325:0xeae8a70e88edbbc2< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Tonight's visit was beyond satisfying. Bonsai is now Redding's most stellar sushi restaurant. Our waiter, Lou recommended the Thai hot salsa (which is equivalent to a salsa) for our sushi and it was to die for. Excellent food and excellent service!</review>

Very unique experience for a sushi restaurant. I think the chef introduces a Thai influence on some of the dishes. Maybe it's upon request but the subtle combo was amazing.</Text>

<Text>Lee is the Sushi king!! We were so excited to try his new restaurant located in what was the Courtyard Cafe. The remodel looks great and the food was amazing!! I had the Maui Zowie roll and it was perfect! The edamame had a wonderful seasoning that set it apart from others I’ve had. Friendly and helpful staff makes Bonsai my new favorite!</Text>< pics>

<Text>This place had much better sushi than most of the places that I have visited in Redding.  The specialty rolls were very large and resonably priced.  The more traditional style was fresh and properly prepared.  They had some interesting side dishes like Kimchi, which was unusually mild.  I went there with my son who has lived in Japan and he was reasonably impressed.</Text>< GmapID>

The food was good, it certainly wasn't bad, but, being from the Bay Area, when you compare, there really isn't any.

I suppose being up in the North State, having sushi, you have to expect that.

My suggestions.

Just having fish on rice dosen't make it sushi. Take a bit more time on appearance. It's part of enjoying great Japanese food.

Also, I know its probably hard to get real fresh fish, but it's a must. Must have fresh garnish too. It's a must. There was no miso soup with dinner, which is a must, or at least offer.

Again, spoiled, from the Bay, but..no buts.
Gotta have it.

3 stars for being our first experience in Redding.

Thanks you!</Review>

First impression was good the place looks good nice and clean not very many rolls and could have been a little better the rice was a little dry the fish tasted good but kinda bland will try again though< /Text>

<text>My vote for, "Best Sushi in Redding." I had one out of towner ask me upon entering if they had all you can eat sushi and they do not. However, having lived in Japan, all you can eat sushi seems excessive. Their fish is prepared excellently and their rolls as well. ご馳走様でした！If you're looking for a place where you can try your taste for each type of fish, this place is great for that experiementation. Other places always had inconsistency in their fish, rice, and their prices were somehow higher. Best bang for your buck for sushi in Redding.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>These guys save our trip and a lot of hassle coming back from our half dome climbing trip yesterday. Justin tow our car and Toby help us fix the radiator hose connector while delaying his lunch break. They put us back on the road in a few hours. I love the small town feel of Oakhurst and the people make effort to help us and everyone out.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1< /rate><text>This company promised me it would take 2 hours to get an initial evaluation to my insurance company for a fire that occurred in the dash. I was out of town and not sure where to go and since their name had the word "electrical" I thought they would be a good choice. It took 30 days before they even bothered to look at the car and many more weeks for them to provide my insurance company with a bid. The bid was way off, since they did not look far enough into the dash to evaluate the fire damage. After 90 days, and nothing done, I had my insurance company ship my car back 350 miles back to Los Angeles. This company never followed up with me as promised and any communication was always initiated by me. Don't come here...very disappointing!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Yosemite Smog and Electrical is GREAT!  I went to get my car smogged.  I was first in line (get there before they open at 8) and my car was smogged first.  Darrell, the manager who is a mature gentleman, was so nice.  I asked him if he had something to clean my dirty windshield intending to clean it myself.  To my surprise, one of the employees did a great job cleaning it after my smog test.  I also told Darrell that my A/C was not working and he took a quick look to make sure that it wasn't something simple right after my windshield was cleaned, so I did not have to wait!  Thank you, Darrell and staff!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Excellent company. This is the place other installers and mechanics send their transmission work to for repair. Always busy. Outstanding technicians.</Review>

< Review>
Very honest, straight shooters. I will definitely use them if I ever need them in the future.

I found this company by accident after being treated rudely by Lara And Sons.

Lara And Sons told me that they couldn't accept my vehicle after telling me to bring it in, because they had no space.< /Review>

<Text>I highly recommend this place if you need your transmission rebuilt this is the place they are professionals and know what they are doing. I took in an old 1970 toyota hilux pickup transmission when most of my friends said you won't find a shop that will repair it. well i took it to jorge and he said dont worry my friend ill open it up and see whats wrong. picked it up a couple of days later ready to go.

These guys are awesome, very honest and very careful with the transmission and the parts of it.
The way they threat you tells how they work.
I really recommend AA Gears & Shafts as the best transmission shop in LA</Review>

<Review>The professionalism and honesty are top notch. Took my car in for an issue thinking it would cost me over $1000 and they found the issue, which was nothing we thought. Final bill was $200. If I lived in LA, these would be my go to mechanics. It’s hard to find trustworthy mechanics now a days. These guys are all of that and more.

Stay away!!! We took in 2 transmissions to be rebuilt after months of them having the transmissions and getting no where we went and picked up the transmissions.  They were told to only rebuild 1.  Use parts from the 2nd if necessary.  They took both apart knowing the 2 transmission were different and not interchangeable.  When we got them back they are missing all the expensive important parts.  Now I have 2 non usable transmissions.  Started with 2 now none.  Horrible company. Out thousand of dollars.<//text>

<time>1477353444417<//time><user>110458790859821419663</user><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My old Ford Ranger was having trouble switching in the low gears and was making horrible noises. So I decided to take it in to AA Gears Shafts very highly recommended by my neighbours across the street.
The initial surprise I had was the employees' attention and the time they spent explaining what they thought might be wrong. They warned me of the initial costs of taking the car in and dismantling it and made it very clear why that was necessary. The day after I was called in to see the problems they had encountered. To my surprise they walked me through the whole intervention and pointed out every detail of what they thought needed to be done. They made sure I understood everything and wrote down a very comprehensive costs list.
The repair was fast and after an initial adjustment needed I can say I'm diriving a 20 year old truck that feels like new.
During the repair they also spotted some issues with a leaking seal under my motor which allowed me to fix that problem before it got any worse.
Highly professional and very kind service.
This is my go to place.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c881720cb889:0x59d66f975a1e70c7</Gmap_id>< Response>

The only place to go if you have transmission problems.  Totally honest and transparent.  They will take pictures to show you the issue.  Their price was half of Amco to do the same work.  Friendly, helpful, totally professional.</Review>

<review>This place is the best transmission shop in Los Angeles.  No exaggeration - this is where the mechanics from other nearby transmission repair places go to buy their parts and ask for advice.  George is totally knowledgeable, helpful, caring, and honest - an amazing guy to find working in a transmission place in LA.  Check out my full review on Yelp.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
Old school motorcycle shop and wrecking yard. They have more old parts than any place I've ever seen. These dudes are a rowdy bunch of grease balls that can diagnose and repair any issue on an old bike, and figure out what random parts will work, or cross over to get it running or riding right. The owner strikes me as a wise old oracle of good times and motorcycle repair. Like a walking shop manual for every bike ever made. Good dudes! I've snagged parts for my 75 honda cb750, my 80 gl1100, 76 Kawasaki kz400. They probably have what you're looking for.</Review>

The first time they worked on it it still didnt run right but they honor their work and when i brought it back they promptly  re-adjusted it and got it running how it should.

<Review>This place is a pretty good place to get Bengali and Bangladeshi restaurants. They have good fresh produce. Also, I love the environment there. It really reminds me of my cultural home back in India. Even during a pandemic they are doing very well and take good measures for protection.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Beef curry was superb! You will know that you are having Bangladeshi curry- not any Indian/ Pakistani curry. We loved it so much!

Staffs are VERY friendly.

The only thing they can improve is they can keep the bathroom cleaner.< /Review>

We visited this place on March 15, 2018. People who usually crave Bangladeshi food come here to eat as well as takeout traditional Bangladeshi food. The taste of the food is good. You will get 2 / 3 types of Pilau, Lentils, Mutton Curry, Fish Curry, Chicken and Mutton Biriyani and Bangladeshi Sweets at Little Dhaka. However, the restaurant ambiance isn’t pleasant enough. It's like takeout style, there's no air conditioning inside and the price seems a little expensive. We can say that the food is good but the overall environment isn't impressive.< /review>

<Text>Best place to get all the desired grocery from west bengal and Bangladesh. Also great fresh food that reminds you off Kolkatta. Like Dal puri. Egg chop. Jhal muri. And many great cooked food. Has a great ambiance. Only if you really love where you came from. Never let your roots to convert to western world. Love this place. Brother Hassan and Taslim. Has taken this place notch up. During this challenging times. While others are closing they are changing with the tied. Love their desire to succeed. May Allah give them lots of prosperity and success. Signing out.</Text>< pictures>

Good people but not too neat as it should be in LA. They put sugar in everything. So if you have diabetes, you should better avoid this place</text>

Good place to get bengali fish. Price is reasonable. The cooked foods are like homecooked foods. Also they have basic Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi grocerry items.<//Text>

Best Goat Biryani in town. All their non veg food items including Fish are great. Been going there for 10+ years now. They have grown from a small hole in the wall to now concentrating on catering business. They have live music on Sundays too now. Very busy nowadays...< /Text>

<text>This is a Bangladesh shop mostly famous for its fish of Bengal collection. It’s not that organized neither you will have lot of options but for specific few Bengali items, this is a must choice. It’s over priced but since there is no other similar store nearby, you are left with no options too. They do catering too and it’s kinda worth.</text>< pics>

!!!COCKROACH!!! Never going again. Purchased a medium size container of curry goat meat to take home and discovered a COCKROACH. DISGUSTING. Now that I think of it, this restaurant is super dirty. The freezers are overpack, nothing gets rotated.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Was here for the first time and really loved the goat (chana dal) curry and the rohu fish curry here.  Judging the quality and taste of these two delicacies and all the reviews I have had heard from my friends, I can easily give this eatery a 5 star. Also the food here is quite cheap.
Just note that the shop closing time is 9:30 pm and not 9:45 pm as mentioned on google.
They also have a great collection of frozen fish. Really thankful to the man at the store who advised us against buying one of the fish pack since it wasnt fresh enough.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd2d0951ef71d1:0x6ba0f976cb502543<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Summary based on 1 dinner:
--pretty good Indian style food
--all veg option available
--friendly, helpful counter service with no language issue
--cheap
--easy parking
--no air con
--no wifi.

$5.99 for a two veg + white rice combo.  The counter guy gave me some raw green chillies after I asked for hot sauce, which I appreciated.  The usual Bollywood clips were on a flat screen.  Seemed clean, but really closest to a hole-in-the-wall I've seen lately.

I don't know why this place doesn't get more business.  It's not fine cuisine, but decent enough.  For the record, plastic spoons/forks and a B Health rating, so maybe not suitable for that romantic date.</text>< Pictures>

Based on google the time they open at 9am
It's currently 10:15am and they're closed, Now I have nothing against this place but I've literally been here for an hour! Either fix the timing or open on the right timing! #wasteingmytime< /review>

<text>This hole in the wall will serve it's purpose when you are driving out in the middle of no where and absolutely need to stop for gas because you are so low that price and quality don't matter because there's no way you'll make it to Woodland, Davis, Vacaville, Cache Creek or wherever you're traveling. The clerk inside was young and friendly. Store is pretty freaking old and hasn't had any quality renovations in years but doesn't seem to be falling apart yet. Convenience store has limited selection somewhat similar to most gas stations. Parking areas seem sketchy especially at night because it's so dark. They could improve with some over head spot lighting in certain  areas for safety. Overall not bad but not something to write home about.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The gas is a little bit expensive here but it's the only gas station you can go to between Cache Creek Casino Resort and Woodland so if you're driving in the area and need gas stop right here plus there's a lot of different drinks and things you can get inside as well that you can pick up before you get back on the road.</review>

We stopped here for some "road sodas" on or way to League of Legends world championship.

They sell pretty much everything you need.  Also snagged a bag of peanuts from a lady in the parking lot for $5.  Who doesn't wan't a a nut sack for $5?

Bathroom is something out of a horror movie but it works.  Would stop here again.<//Text>

This place sells propane tanks, doesn't provide propane fill services. Sells more items than your typical c-store. Fuel pumps are a tight manuver with a large vehicle or trailer.<//text>

It's a gas station in the middle of nowhere next to the only stop sign on a two lane road. It's fine.</Review>

I handed my son a $10 bill and three ones to put gas in his truck the owner gave him $8 worth of gas and swore we did not give the $13. I had to threaten to call the police before he would give me my $5. Take your business elsewhere this man is a thief<//Review>

Zero costumer service skills. The women who process my mail even told me “if your letter got lost is not my fault” what kind of service is that? A horrible attitude. I would never go back there.</Text>

<review>Applied for passport,was seen by 3 different people,all were friendly, helpful and professional. It may take You longer if there is a long line or You don't have the right application form or Your required documents. They tell You 6-8 weeks to get a passport but i received it in 30 days. I got an email from Homeland Security saying that it depends on how busy they are and how many applications there are. I would recommend that You make copies of all your documents before You turn in application as the PO charges $1.00 to make copies. Get Your passport photos in advance @ Walgreens or UPS or AAA because the day i was there their camera was not working.< /review><user>105016008472388451965<//user>< Resp>

I came to send an international package and this lady was talking to me « screaming » very badly, I was trying to understand as her ghetto English was very bad !
And this other lady didn’t wanted to give me a pen so I can send my package !
Those people shouldn’t have this job position ! They have no respect for customers especially that they don’t even say a Hello!
Ridiculous those two women talked to me very bad and I hate this way how they can treat people who is here to send something !</Text>

Started Friday morning at the Martinez post office for a passport the line was literally out the door so I decided to go to the Rodeo post office thinking it would be less people but while waiting in line the man behind the counter said that the only woman doing passports went home early..really needing to get this done I went to Pinole where after waiting in line for 20 min the woman behind the counter said she was only taking appointments and could not help me,I decided to give Richmond a go,let me say the woman doing passports here is amazing!!best experience out of all the post offices I Visited today she was so personable and so funny Very thorough and professional I will definitely recommend her to anyone getting a passport she was amazing!!</Text>

They really don't know what "Customer Service" is... Like I was waiting for her to get done with the person in front of me and when it was my turn she just went in and never came back. It was like she was doing it on her own.. There were only 2 employees. That's it.</text>

I've been coming here for 7 years because is the only location near me. Every time I come here my experience of customer non-service gets worse. I thought was unique to the old staff, but they now have new staff, and they are even less friendly and more rude. Bad attitude and rudeness must be an employment pre-requisite; or perhaps, part of the new employee training program. And then they wonder why the government is always cutting the post office budget, and are closing offices locations, etc. Answer: Rude people providing terrible service. This location is not deserving of a 1/2 star review, but since the 1/2 is not in the ratings to choose, I am giving it 1 star.<//text>

<text>I’ll start by saying you would think corporate would have stepped in and cleaned house after reading all of these horrible reviews, however all of the same employees are still employed. The passport office was closed at 2pm with a sign reading, out for lunch, will return at 2:50pm. Disappointed I told myself that I could find something to do until 2:50 pm and I did. I arrived back at 3:15 pm to another sign reading, full for the day. Trying to be patient I asked the women behind the counter will they be opened tomorrow, she rolled her and said yes, at 10:45 am. This visit ranked in at number one for the worst customer service experience and unprofessional organization as a whole!<//text>< pics>

Normally I don’t write reviews and I let this go, since I woke in customer service, but my interaction with front clerk “Lavette” was very unpleasant.
I had to ship a package and I needed guidance, not knowing what forms to fill, cost, or other basic information. Lavette was very short, unwelcome, did not smile once when interacting with me, and she was very short with her answers that made me feel stupid.
I kept my cool and continue to be cordial and tried to make conversation but Lavette was nothing but dismissive.
I had to move aside to fill forms for my package and as other customers kept coming Lavette service changed as if she was profiling and choosing who got better service from her. This made me so uncomfortable and wondering if it had something to do with the way I was dressed or even my nationality.
I definitely do NOT recommend this post office and if you must try to avoid Lavette.< /review>

I went earlier today and the lady that was working there was plain rude. They should have people there to help others and have patience. I don't recommend coming here.<//Review>

I wish I could go to another post office. Here are nothing but rude eye rolling bitter people I had to go to the office on Chanslor to look for my package. The company where I bought my item at said it was at the Richmond post office and ready for pick up on the 12th. I first went to the Chanslor office where they said they had no kknowledge of my package and to try the office on Nevin and this was at 10:05 A.M. I then was waiting for 10:10 to 10:30 just to speak to some one whwn finally helped the lady had a rude tone saying can I help you when I told her I was looking for my package and had all my information she rolled her eyes after getting my information and said it would be at the chanslor office and it opened at 10:00 i told her I just came from there and they said to try here and she said they open at 10:00 i repeated I just came from there and they said to come here it is 10:40 she still was then bobbing her head and doing little hand movements. And in the mean time the other lady was taking a rude tone to a customer next to me saying oh well your package was delivered there’s no refunds and saying a person could of picked it up what kind of service do you guys show really????!!! Train your people on customer service and how to be polite not I nor the person was being rude or yelling.< /Text>

I've been calling and no one answers the phone. I've had a package that tracking says has been stuck there with no movement since Feb. 6 and it's Feb.28th! Ugggh answer the phone. I'm overseas and stayed awake all night to wait for them to open. It's almost 3 am and I'm still trying to get through. They have been open for 2 hours now.</text>

<text>Built in the 1950s and 60s I believe listen to Harbor is a important important entity of the city and counties economic portfolio is also enjoyed by many citizens and tourist to like for its beautiful location it’s proximity to wildlife and California Channel Islands State Park visitor center and an assortment of shops and dining options this is probably one of the best infrastructure ideas investment that pays for itself<//text>< rating>

One of the nicest harbors that you'll ever visit or live in. The village is an easy walk with lots of cool shops, great restaurants, a huge arcade for kids, a Maritime Museum, and more. Also they have lots of events there all year round. Very clean, neat, and friendly. I love Ventura Harbor. You will too!!<//Text>

This is an evil place. Truly something dark is in the water. Tried drown me. I stabbed it. It was invisible and powerful and screamed when cut. It screams no more.<//Text>

<Review>The foods are delicious. Especially , the Home-Style tofu is very yummy.
We like Kung Pao Tofu at the others Chinese restaurant; however the Home-Style Tofu at this restaurant made a big impression.
The chef made it very good, it is savoury, moisture, and just a little bit of spicy.
The waiter and waitress are nice, friendly, and helpful.
We ordered three dishes. We are very pleased with all : The Home-Style Tofu, Stir Fried three delights, and Home style crispy pancake.
The price is reasonable</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2da96ec9d88c1:0x9b38911830d20a35< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Overall, the dishes brought to the table don’t match the pictures in the menu. The taste is not even close to what it should be. Most important, all three of us had diarrhea one hour after left this restaurant. The vegetable dish was sandy like not washed; the fish tasted like right out of shopping bag. Luckily, we don’t get sicker than that. The service is very poor!!! Not recommended ！！<//Text>

Lots of authentic northern style dishes. Taste was great place was quite busy. Downside was the smoking from the outside patrons wafted in from the street while we were getting to eat. Enjoyed the food.<//Review>

Service here SUCKS! If you are not Asian, they ignore you! I had to flag down someone on the wait staff just to place my order. Then 10 minutes later I had to ask another person in the wait staff where the rest of our food was. They come minutes later to tell me they forgot to put that part of the order in! Really! Never eat here!< /Text>

<Text>This place doesn't get enough love for the food it serves - authentic Northern Chinese dishes. For the uninitiated, all those flower pepper / ginger / spicy type dishes you see in TV shows about China is the cuisine they serve here. Most of the Chinese food you get in mixed restaurants (let's say that also serve Vietnamese, Korean or Thai) don't serve the same type of food you would get at a place like this.

Although the food is tasty, the prices are a bit high. Also the ambient decor of the restaurant is a little disheveled looking. Factor in horrible parking during weekends and busy lunch hours, and it's a restaurant you really have to be in the mood for to make the trip if you're not a local. They also do take-out if you rather eat at home, but you have to know what to order (it's a traditional menu style restaurant - no bright signs or anything)< /Text>< gmap_id>

This is a terrible place with even worse service.  I ordered a shrimp dish.  The shrimp were old and tasted bad and spoiled.  I brought that to the attention of our server and she demanded that I pay for it even though I just had one bite.  I told her that the food was spoiled and I did not want to pay for it.  When I got up to leave she blocked the door and would not let me leave unless I paid for it.  I paid for the dish but I will call the health department on Monday..  If you like delicious and fresh Chinese food do not go to this place.< /Review>

<Text>an okay place for chinese food, but the parking lot is almost always full. You are not allowed to enter the plaza to wait for a spot or load/unload someone because of the security folks when the parking lot is full, which is suck for a busy place. Well, they will lose customers because of this suck regulation.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) The service in the store is super good, and the boss is also special nice. I didn't think there was some malicious evaluation! I have a convulsion in my head! This is a cure for the disease. Looking at people living overseas, it may be a psychological imbalance! But it can't be like this! Every time I go to the store, the waiter's attitude is particularly good. I didn't want to say it in the comment. I really don't know why the United States let these evil people come out. Also say what only to pack in plastic bags! Or you didn't do personnel, don't let it be like you! Learn how to be a man and go abroad!

店里的服务超级好，老板也特别的nice。我没想道还有一些恶意评价的！脑袋抽风了吧！这是病得治，看着人家在海外生活，可能是心理不平衡吧！但是也不能这样啊！我每次去店里服务员的态度特别好没有一次是想hao评论中说的那样。真的不知道为什么美国让这些恶人出来。还说什么只让用塑料袋打包！还是你们没有做人事，不让怎么偏偏对你这样呢！学习一下怎么做人再出国吧！<//Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>(Translated by Google) The worst Chinese restaurant in the United States for more than 20 days of travel! We had to order the food and order it. We first said that the package was charged. Then we never heard that the package was charged. The clerk said that they had to pack it, and only the plastic bag was not provided. The wonderful trip is super unpleasant.
Do Chinese people doing business overseas only bully the Chinese?
What a nuisance the restaurant is!

在美国20多天行程遇到的最差劲的中餐餐厅！我们吃完饭剩点菜想打包，先说打包要收费，然后我们从未听说打包要收费，店员又说必须他们给打包，只给塑料袋不提供餐盒。美好的行程弄的超级不愉快。
在海外经商的中国人只会欺负中国人吗？

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have been looking for this place for 3 years !!! I am from the Far East of Russia and have been looking for real Chinese food in L.A. for a long time. And I found it! There is no limit to my joy, as in Ussuriysk and in the best Chifalovki in Vladivostok. This food is the best in the world. And the dialect is familiar. Here is a real china town!

Я искал это место 3 года!!! Я с дальнего востока России и долго искал настоящую китайскую кухню в л.а. И я нашел! Моей радости нет предела, как в Уссурийске и в лучших чифаловках Владивостока. Эта еда лучшая в мире. И говор знакомый. Здесь настоящий china town!< /Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Will it be a so-called Xinjiang dish? The usual skewered lamb was delicious, but the others were subtle. Perhaps I was bald with the Japanese, but the friendly atmosphere was good. Unfortunately, the card was not usable. If I went to the next night thinking that I forgot to take a photo, what would it be for a charter? It was like a feeling. Is it better for Japanese people to eat in China?

(Original)
いわゆる、新疆的な料理になるんでしょうか？よくある串刺しの羊肉はうまかったですが、他は微妙でした。たぶん日本人とバレてたとは思いますが、フレンドリーな雰囲気は良かったです。残念なのはカードが使えないコトでした。写メ撮るの忘れたーと思って次の日の夜行ってみたら、何だか貸切？っぽい感じになっていました。中国で食べるほうが日本人には合っているかな？</Text>

<review>Came to the store to look at phones as I was considering trading in my phone. Romeo took the time to explain the features on the phones I was looking at and helped me make a well informed decision,  he is super savvy!! Romeo provided the best customer service and has the most pleasant personality!!! I asked a ton of questions and he never rushed me and took the time to answer every single one of them. It's always a pleasure to walk in to a store where you feel welcomed and Romeo definitely did that. I will return to this store as long as Romeo is the one that helps me out.
I've been in the store a few times and the same can not be said for the other young man (I believe his name is Fernando) that works there, if you are going to work in the service industry the way you greet and treat customers makes the difference in them returning or recommending your store to others.</review></record>

I did an update this morning & then I couldn't go back into the phone at all. I came to this Verizon store for help. Noe was able to clear things up & get it open. Then, Hilda backed up my pictures for me. They were both so great!!! I was lost without my phone, but they saved the day for me. I am very thankful for them.

Thank you!< /review>

I am completely comfortable with my new purchase and exactly what I will be paying.
I will ALWAYS come to see Hilda for my Verizon needs. If she moves I better know what store she relocated to. Thank you Hilda!</Review>< username>

<text>Today I went into this excellent Verizon location and was greeted by Michelle right away.  Michelle listened to all of my needs,  sat me down, physically showed me all of my options, and explained everything perfectly.  It was because of  Michelle that  I  went from being totally angry at my former provider to  being very happy with my new provider  (Verizon)!  Michelle spent a lot of time with me  in order to make sure I was completely set up and that all of  my questions or potential questions were answered.  She made  me feel comfortable and I would 100% go back to this Verizon location to work with Michelle or any of her other co-workers who were all very friendly!  Thanks everyone!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1495480842102, 'text': 'Thank you for your business and for taking time to share your experience with us.

<Review>I have been a long time customer of Verizon.  I want to say that Romeo gave me the best service I have ever received at any Verizon store. He worked with me for several days trying to get my pictures from my cell phone transfer to my computer. I took a laptop in to him and he was able to do this for me.   About a year ago I had to buy a new charger. That is about the same time I could no longer transfer the pictures from cell to computer. Finally put 2 & 2 together. We discovered my charging cord was not the right cord to do transfers it is only for charging! Thank you Romeo. (he needs a raise!)</Review><time>1501172233095< /time>< user_id>

Great service! Michelle gave us great customer care and was very knowledgeable on all the phone questions I had.

She mentioned all the promotions they had going on and ended up saving us a lot more money than we had expected.

They're 5 stars for a reason!

I kind of messed up and made her do a bunch more work but she took care of it all and with no qualms. Thanks Michelle! Will be coming back for all my Verizon needs</Review>

Here is what happens when I present Hilda, the store manager, with questions about and problems experience as I try to use my brand new Google Pixel2 XL phone and Samsung Galaxy Tab E 32GB tablet:. She listens carefully, spots the root of each problem quickly and precisely, and, calling on her vast knowledge of Verizon products and how they function, offers an explanation easily understood by her client (me) and demonstrates the operations necessary for correction of the difficulty and proper operation of the device!  May I add that when I first visited her store about a week ago, I was very impressed with her support for the sales associate who helped me when I purchased the devices referenced above.  My visit with Hilda yesterday was most rewarding, and I request that you acknowledge her and annotate her HR record to indicate that she received this acknowledgement for truly superior customer service.  I shall not hesitate to refer friends, family, and others to Hilda's store!< /Review>

Just moved to this area from the Inland Empire. Had great customer service experience with both Hilda & Noe.  Noe was also  very knowledgeable and a good sales person. The phone I ordered arrived ahead of the actual delivery date as well, which was awesome. Thank you for all the time you took out with me to help.</Review>

<text>Hi I have been with Verizon since 1996 . I recently needed help with my phone and Hilda Ruiz was an amazing helper! She even helped me 10 min before closing time and had the patience and the passion to help. You don't see alot of workers who really care like that because of her I know that Verizon is loyal to their customers. Thank you so much for the great service!</text>< username>

I went in on a Saturday evening, I was having a tough night because my phone was broken, I was left phone-less.  My situation was a bit difficult because I was on someone else’s account, I wanted my own account so at this point I knew this would be a process. Romeo Bui was so nice to me, professional and helpful. He was working by his self and managed to handle all the customers. He went the extra mile for me, he even waited for me to go to my bank to deposit money so that I could get my phone. I could go on and on about that night. In a nut shell instead of complaining that the store was closing, he proceeded to help me until
Everything was done, it was past closing. Thank you again Romeo! I normally don’t write reviews but you made my day so much better and you understood my frustration. You truly went above and beyond for me!!!< /review>

Came in for help with my phone and the manager Hilda Ruiz was very helpful. She helped me move pictures to my sd card and give me space on my phone so I can finally use my phone. She was very patient and kind. Will highly recommend her if you need help.< /text>

I had such a pleasant experience at this Verizon. I ordered for a Samsung note 8 and the manager gave me a call telling me that it came. The customer service is top notch and I will definitely be coming back if I need any assistance.</Text>

<review>I was looking for a price comparison because I'm thinking of leaving Sprint (again) and coming back to Verizon. Romeo Bui helped run numbers on 2 different phones and gave me some useful information, without pressuring me. The 3 star rating in no way reflects Romeo's great service. In fact, he should be commended for his service.

The 3 star rating is because of a female associate at this location. She wasn't the manager, just a sales specialist. While Romeo was working with me, she interrupted us rudely, without apology, and asked him to find a screen protector. Romeo handled the situation well, and I waited patiently. About5 minutes after he came back and resumed the estimate with me, this same female associate came back and said notified him that his customer was coming in to pick up a phone, again interrupting without apology. I kept quiet. I finally spoke up when she said, loudly, "And he's RUDE!". I corrected her and said it's rude of her to speak that way of a customer in front of another customer. Instead of apologizing, she answered me back saying, "I was talking to him", referring to Romeo. I notified her that it didn't matter to whom she was speaking, it's inappropriate to speak of a customer that way in front of another customer. She walked away without apologizing.

That employee needs much further training in her interactions with and around customers. Management may want to look closely into retraining her not just on the information for Verizon's services, but just basic customer service and manners, as she appears to lack both.

At this point, Romeo is the only one keeping my interest in becoming a Verizon customer again.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My boyfriend's phone got messed up when we went to raging waters last week and since we couldn't prepare the water damage, we decided to hit up this Verizon store in hopes of getting a new phone for him asap! (Bf was disappointed he couldn't reply to my Bitmojies with his own 😂)I was quite surprised upon entering this store, it was spacious and had several booths that you could sit in to speak with a sales rep. We were helped by Romeo and he did an excellent job! Bf wasn't sure on which phone he'd want, he had a few on his mind.. Romeo took his time to explain the pros and cons of each phone and by the end of it bf was certain he wanted the g6. Romeo also took his time to fill out the rebate application which was quite nice! It's been a week now and he loves his phone. Thanks to Romeo's help,  bf can now reply my bitmojies with his own!😂 👍🏻</Review>

<review>Jason was great: professional, explained everything thoroughly, allowed me to talk without interrupting, and was able to intelligently troubleshoot the issue. He was at our house for maybe an hour and a half but he wasn't intrusive on our evening and was as efficient as possible. I'm bummed he wasn't able to fix our no air conditioning problem today but thrilled that he at least had the diagnosis.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1622690456827<//time>< Rating>

The guys were, Kyle, Roy &  Mark. They did a very neat, very professional job.  They kept me informed along the way as to their progress.  The new unit cools so much faster, got it just in time before it really heats up.  I highly recommend them.  Big Thank you...Julie Carder</review>

Unfortunately, some promises made during the sales process fall well short and management is disorganized and, at times, unprofessional. Price is on par with the higher end companies and systems. Expect to pay about $18k for a 5 ton AC and heating system using existing ducts, including permits. The biggest issue that I had was the emphasis on certain guarantees and policies made during the sales process. One item singled out by the salesman was the "Customer Respect" clause that states technicians will not use tobacco products while on property. I guess smoking in my driveway was an exception? The next was the "Property Protection Guarantee" that states "Damaged property will be replaced or repaired."  They had to cut a larger hole in the attic to get the new unit in -- no problem -- totally understandable.  But they don't have any drywall experts on staff, so they sent out a contractor who, in front of me, discussed how he doesn't have the right parts to install bull-nosed edges.  So he proceeded to install right-angle edging on two sides, butted up against my bull-nosed edges on the two adjacent sides (the whole house has bull-nosed corners on every wall and facet). For 5 months, I continued to tell them that it was wrong and withheld final payment waiting for them to fix it. Despite telling the sales person 3 times, and the backoffice another 2 or 3 times.  It wasn't until some accountant saw the small amount due that we finally agreed that I'd just hire my own contractor to fix it -- that was 5 months after installation! And  regardless of the bull-nose issue, their drywall  sub-contractor failed to match the paint, did a horrible job to where you could see the flashing he installed (metal) and copped an attitude when he didn't like the answer to his question about my satisfaction.  The final straw that drove me to share my experience was the "free" maintenance included in my contract. They called about a month ago and told me that I'm due for maintenance and they'll come out.  Well today, the morning that they were supposed to come out, they called and canceled.  I took time off of work to stay home for this!  Their excuse? "We like to perform maintenance 1 year after installation". Ummm.. YOU CALLED ME!   Whatever. Give me my two free maintenances, honor your warranty and we can agree that any other business will go to competitors. Don't point out your "cool differentiating guarantees" in your contract if you can't live up to them. Honestly had that not been such a big part of the sales pitch, I probably wouldn't have sweated the relatively minor infractions here -- I would have just chalked it up to being a mediocre contractor. Oh well...< /review>

Jason came out for ac and furnace tuneup for my two properties on the same day. He was very professional and knowledgeable. He recommended what repairs or replacement need to be done with possible outcomes and benefits. It was a great experience all around. I wish Jason the best. The company should promote this guy so he can share his approach to customers. Or does the company only hire good ones? 😀</Review>

Cool experience to fix an air-conditioning ( no pun intended).
My system was acting...Instead of cooling down it was blowing "hot air".
My wife said " do something about this"...So I called AirTech Pro's
and I got help the next day. The young man who helped me,  Jason was very efficient . He had to climb on the roof and  got some action going immediately when  he was attacked by the a bunch of wasps who had turned my A/C unit in a vacation resort. After taking a few moments to show the wasps "who was the boss",  he then   in figured  out what was wrong with the unit. He was very patient with me  ,  explained what was wrong in terms I could understand  answered all my questions before I could ask them and most important, got the A/C going . This made me and especially my wife  happy...Jason save my bacon.</text>

<Text>After taking the time to meet with 4 different hvac companies I chose this one. Why?  Because they did not try to automatically sell me a whole new system. They wanted to fix what I had and go on from there. And you know what? I have a great working ac system again. The honesty of the employees literally saved me $5k; plus they were able to come and install the new part 3 days after they came to see what I had.  It was a breath of fresh air to work with this company.< /Text>< resp>

Air Tech installed our current AC system two years ago when our previous system died.  At the time, they did a terrific job and exceeded our expectations.

Recently, they contacted us regarding scheduling a free annual maintenance visit and performed the service this morning.  Much like the original installation, the service provided was outstanding!  Eric was the tech assigned to us and he did not disappoint.  He was on-time, professional, and thoroughly explained what he was doing while providing great recommendations to extend the life of our system.

I should also mention that last year, Air Tech also replaced our water heater and our experience was the same.  We highly recommend them!< /text>

< Review>
I have had to follow up with the scheduling team multiple times to get a technician out for our project. Once our first tech arrived, he looked at our project and said he needed to run to Home Depot for supplies. He came back and began work but advised he was waiting for a partner to arrive to do his portion. 5 hours later, he left for the day with half the job done because the partner never showed and a hole was left on the side of my house. I had to call repeatedly the next day to get a new time for someone to come back out to patch the hole and finish the job. Two days later,  a different tech arrived and said he was only told to do one portion of the job. He didn't finish that portion and advised he would be reaching out the next day. He never did. I got tired of calling and let this go to see how long it took for them to call me back. TWO WEEKS LATER....I received a bill. I called and advised that the project was not complete. It took 2 days for the scheduling dept to call me back again. Today, I sat through my two hour service window without a peep. I called the office. My tech is out sick and no one told me. Now I am waiting to see if the substitute "who is on their way" shows up and can finally finish this job. This project was something my project manager advised should take an hour or two and has turned into a 6 week fiasco that I have had to manage FOR this company. Highly unorganized and not detailed about follow up and communication AT ALL. Would not reccommend.</Review>

<Review>Jason came today to do our 6 month maintenance check. He was very professional, great communication from AirTech on when he would arrive, and when he left his last customer. He informed us of the operation of the HVAC, and possible additions to make the house more allergy free. We appreciated the information. Jason is a great representative for AirTech!</Review>< UserId.>

Very respectful and knowledgeable tech. He took the time to explain details of my system from all positive and negatives. Gave options for proper repair/ replacements, and also answered a few other questions based on upgrades I requested. I plan on requesting Mike for future maintenance.< /Text>

Jeramie was very polite, respectful and courteous. He explained including showing me pictures of the furnace, its working status, suggested future work to keep my furnace in top condition. I appreciate his patience answering all my questions and I felt he listened to me intently. This company has consistently provided me great service. I don't ever feel I'm getting ripped off or pressured. Thank you!<//Text>

Mike helped us check the furnace up in the attic and recommended an air purifier due to our allergy issues. He was very professional and thorough. We are very happy and can’t wait to see the results of the air purifier to improve our overall health. We signed up for their 2 year RSA immediately. Will definitely recommend to friends about their excellent service!</text>

This company is excellent. Their customer service is one in a million, from their first contact to quote a job, continuing with scheduling and installation. This is the second install this company has performed for us. They previously installed an HVAC unit at a rental I owned in 2019 and we were so impressed with their workmanship then that I urged my mom to consider them for her install. She was equally impressed. If you want quality workmanship and excellent customer service, you need to choose AirTech.< /Text>

Alex V performed our annual AC inspection in April 2021. He was prompt, professional, and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and courteous. We've been AirTech customers for years and are highly satisfied with the service we've received.<//Text>

<Review>Mark and Kevin were here all day installing our new heating/AC system. They were not only professional but highly efficient, clean and thorough! We were very impressed and so glad we chose AirTech! They kept us posted throughout the day and told us everything to expect. They also made sure we had active heating (1st day of a 3 day job) on this rainy night, which we were appreciative of. Excellent overall...and I don’t give that praise unless it’s earned!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

They replaced the water heater. Both technicians were extremely friendly, on time, professional, experts, and put a lot of pride in their work. Rarely we find these type of technicians put such efforts in their work as they did. They are both a tremendous asset to the company. I will recommend this business and these technicians to everyone I know without any hesitations.

Great job both of you.

Instead, I received a pressure-sales pitch for a long term maintenance plan. The technician Mike also gave me a few suggestions on system upgrades to address a cold bathroom, only to find out later that he had also found a disconnected duct in the attic (which is the obvious cause of the cold bathroom, but he did nothing about it while he was up there - not even a quick tape job). When Mike realized that I was not likely to purchase the expensive monthly maintenance plan he was selling, he quickly left and never sent me the evaluation report that was promised and paid for. The company has not since responded to my messages requesting the report, and it looks like I will now need to file a dispute with my credit card company to reverse the $49 charge. As an ex-building code official and general contractor, I do not recommend this company to anyone.</text>< pics>

Jason is very professional and knowledgeable about the service performed. He was prompt and arrived earlier than expected, which worked great for me. He showed me some improvements that I can make to my HVAC run more efficiently. Jason even went above and beyond and vaccumed out my outside system to clean out all the leaves and debris that get caught in the system over time.I am very pleased with his friendly and fast service.
Additionally, Air Tech will be coming back and giving me an estimate on much needed ductwork,  so I am anticipating continued professional service with this company.< /text>

< Review>
No follow through. Air Tech told me I could received a refund for replacement parts installed within the last six months if I had to replaced the old HVAC units with new units. I accepted, and then Air Tech installed two new HVAC units at my duplex. Afterwards, I called several times to inquire about the refund as I had not received it. Also, I had to call again because the permit with the County had not been processed. After several calls, I had to take it upon myself to get ahold of the County and schedule an appointment for a final inspection. Great sales pitch upfront, but no follow through.<//Review>

David from AirTech was on time and  knew his stuff. He took great care to explain each step of his inspection along with his findings regarding the performance of my hvac system. This was a top notch inspection of my entire system.  Before David left, he provided me with a detailed report of his findings. When I am next in need of any hvac services here in Sacramento, I’ll be calling AirTech for sure.</review>

Good value if it’s important for you to know what parts of your home furnace are on their way out and some warning signs. Air Tech has a membership for $180 but after reading the brochure, it’s not a good value for what’s included in the $180. At the end of the day, you have to pay for parts and service if something goes wrong. The future discount offered through buying this membership is absolutely insignificant.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>AirTech is awesome! After having an old unit serviced by AirTech, we decided to buy a completely new system. It’s now been 2 years and the system is still running like the day it was installed. We just had our 2 year service today, and Kris from AirTech came out. He was very professional and courteous. He took the time to explain everything he went through in a way that was easy for us to understand. We appreciate AirTech and the overall way they operate. From calling the main line, to installers and service technicians, I have had only positive interactions with their staff. We even extended our warranty today to add another 2 years of service from them! Thanks AirTech 😊

Another great service from AirTech on 1/18/2021. Jason came out to take care of our maintenance and perform a system check. As always, the system is in great condition and we received great service from the technician.

AirTech Heating and air answered our call for a second opinion on our HVAC system. From the knowledgeable girl answering my call to the tech. I knew I was in good hands.   Tech Ronnie C was on time professional and knowledgeable.  He checked our system took pics and explained our system so we easily understood.  Ronnie assured us he would be there for us and our needs.  I highly recommend AirTech Heating and air to all my neighbors here in El Dorado Hills and beyond!< /Text>

<Date>1582922522742</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I am very happy to give the highest recommendation to AirTech. I don’t think anyone really sees the need to replace their heating/air unit as a fun experience but at least Darwin and Roy made it a pleasant experience. For the last 13 years my living room has always been cold in the winter and hot in the summer where the rest of the house was the opposite. Now with the new unit and the properly installed venting, everywhere is balanced and very comfortable. These two wonderful gentlemen managed to completely replace the unit and all the ducting both inside and outside of my house without disturbing any of my landscaping nor did they leave a mess any where. It honestly looks like no one has been there. During the installation I also got a call from their office each day -Kelsey- asking how things were going and if there were any problems. Service like this is hard to find. In addition to their great service on the job their prices are good also. They are neither the cheapest and certainly not the most expensive but they guarantee their systems for 10 years and that also is rare for the industry.  In our mountain communities sometimes it is very hard to find reliable people to do repairs I feel extremely lucky to have found AirTech. They are truly outstanding.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Mike was on time, communicated well and was very knowledgeable about my HVAC unit as a whole.  He was kind with my dog, wore a mask and had shoe protectants to not get my floors dirty.  Thanks Mike for a wonderful job!!  AirTech Pro's you are awesome once again!</text>

Upfront, honest & professional. Very informative.  Didn’t give me a drawn out Boring sales pitch. I can’t wait to get the active dust free air purifier for my home.

Update.  Everything went amazing!!!   Instantly I could smell that clean air.  And the smell after cooking didn’t last very long compared to before. Ronnie did a great job.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND AIR TECH.<//Text>

<text>This will be a mixed review.( This was a call on a rental I own, in which I live 3 hours away). Although, the company and technician were quick, friendly and responsive to my initial call and SECOND call, I had to make after what was initially fixed failed, within about two weeks. So in RESPONSE TIME I'D RATE 5 STARS. PERFORMANCE AND COST...A 1.

The first time out they charged me nearly 700.00 and they OVERCHARGED ME WHAT QUOTED , BUT THEY DID later CREDIT ME when I called them on it.  But BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED AN INVOICE for the FIRST VISIT and for the SECOND VISIT--( 2nd visit cost me just shy of $900! )  I never specifically knew or understood the breakdown of what was fixed. I CALLED SEVERAL times, over a month, requesting a mailing of invoice so I could review what was exactly done. I'm now left feeling that had the first job been done the way it should of I wouldn't of needed the second call, therefore I would of paid half. Hopefully, when I get back home both invoices will have been delivered this last week!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am so impressed with Air Tech -- from the initial visit by Mike, then another one with Mike and Chris, removal of old (and dangerous) furnace, installation of new and more efficient furnace plus ductwork by Kyle, Moses and Zach. They'll return in a couple of weeks to run ductwork to the 2nd story so it will have heat for the first time.  Wow, these guys.  And everything was beautifully coordinated by Kelsey in the office.

My house is about 50 years old and built by monkeys (sorry, that's a disservice to monkeys).  I've been upgrading it for the 10 yrs I've owned it and since the old furnace worked, I didn't worry about it... until I thought I should have it inspected. As it turns out, it was illegally installed 25 years ago and had cracks in the burners.  Not safe at all.

I'm grateful to Air Tech for their professionalism, quality service, communication (which several of the people said was a keystone of their business), and HEAT!  So nice.  I highly recommend them!< /Text><Response>None<//Response><Time>1605313584792< /Time>< Pics>

< Review>
All of the people we dealt with at Air Tech were very professional and knowledgeable. Kris originally fixed our heater when we had issues several weeks ago. His skills and professionalism led to us getting a bid from Dan at Air Tech to replace the entire HVAC system. Dan was very thorough in accessing our needs and provided a cost effective solution. Then Darwin and Roy did an excellent job removing the old system and installing the new system. They were courteous, knowledgeable, skilled and quick and they wore masks! We were very impressed and we are glad we selected Air Tech for our new system.</Review>

Our service Technician was Mike. We are having an issue with our AC and  home warranty company connected with AirTech Heating and Air.  Mike was very professional, listened intently to our concerns and problems.  Took his time to check out the entire unit, explained things to us, and told us what to expect next.  Unfortunately, he was unable to repair our unit until approval from our warranty plan, plus it is a part that needs to be ordered.  So it is no fault on his part that we are still without AC.  He apologized for not being able to do more today, know we are heading back into triple digits this weekend. Overall, we are very pleased with the service that was provided, and looking forward to another visit hopefully early next week to get us cooling again.</Text>

<text>My tech Jeremie was very professional and was able to give me insight on the furnace.
He diagnosed the problem right away and was able to order the part to repair in the near future. Meanwhile he was able to get my furnace running and I was very grateful!
He's very friendly and I felt very comfortable having him in my home.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I have been doing business with Air Tech for all my air conditioning and heating needs for some time now. I have been very happy with all the employees and now especially with the safe and responsible way my new duct system was installed. To look at the house afterwards you would never believe that the work was done. Very happy as usual.
But the attic fan was not plugged back in so I have been calling every Monday morning to the office to have a tech come out. It has been 3 months and today a tech David came out and it took less than 5 minutes to plug it into the correct outlet.
Not so happy with them right now. Should never have to have the customer call every week with no response. 😡😡😡</Review>

Jeramie called about 15 minutes before arriving. He was to be at my place between 12 and 3. He arrived at 12:25. He saw me wrestling with my garden hose and offered to coil it for me. That was a huge help. Then he explained the service he was going to do. During the work he stopped to give me status updates and explain what he did and found. After he was finished we went over what he found. He suggested I have a free consultation with one of their energy advisers. He helped me set up the appointment. He was very careful to wear the overshoe booties to protect my floors. I had a very pleasant experience with AirTech. I highly recommend them.< /review>

They price match/beat, saved me $500 on a $2000 job. Their communication is frequent and professional, and were very understanding of the rush need to get heat running for my tenant (they expedited the parts which saved 5 business days!). Just didn’t like that they wouldn’t schedule the work until the parts came in, which ended up costing 2 more days. Will definitely use again!</Review>

AirTech Heating and Air is by far the best HVAC company I have ever worked with! My tech RONNIE C was right on time, very professional, but also super polite and friendly. He went above and beyond to answer all my questions and fix immediate system problems. AirTech pricing is very reasonable compared to other companies too. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I HIGHLY recommend AirTech for all HVAC needs, they'll treat you right!<//text>

The crew and staff at AirTech are excellent at keeping you informed leading into the job, through the job and after install follow up inspections.  I always knew what they were doing, when they would be there.  the office staff checks in twice a day with the customer during install to be sure there are no issues.  I had a follow up call after the install from the owner.  I had a couple questions and he was incredibly informative.</text>

< review>
Right in the middle of a heat wave, on the hottest day of the year, our ac decided that it had enough of the heat and stopped working, so called sT morning expecting them to say they were all booked up, and wouldn't be able to come for at least a couple of days.  When thry told me they would be over in a couple of hours i was thrilled.

When the tech Jeramie showed up, he was actually there at the beginning of the window. He was courteous and was will to answer any if the questions that i had. He diagnosed my problem and had the ac back uo and spitting out cold air within the hour.  I will be for sure using airtech again if/when we have any hvac issue.

Also the receptionist/dispatcher was also very kind and helpful.  I felt like i was talking to someone i had known for a while<//review>

I contacted AirTech in response to a mailer offering a system check up for good price and scheduled an appointment.
We recently purchased our home in Placerville knowing  full well that the HVAC system is 30 years old; inefficient and tired.
Mike arrived on schedule and was ready with mask, gloves, booties...yes, this was during "shelter in place" rules.
Mike went about his inspection efficiently, pausing several times to answer my questions and explain what he was finding.
At completion he summarized his findings and we discussed options. I have followed up with AirTech regarding a new system.
Mike is knowledgeable, personable; a great introduction to the company!</Text>

Great experience! Heat just hit when I realized my A/C wasn't working. Jeremie from Air Tech came out and clearly explained the issue and gave me options. He was able to locate the issue. I don't have to suffer through another evening. I appreciate Jeremie’s promptness and professionalism. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

Darwin and Dan showed up to replace the furnace and did an amazing job in a small difficult basement.

Ronnie was very professional and quick.  He did have recommendations in which I first agreed to but because of the water leak which destroyed half our house we need to hold off until we see how much we have left over after the reconstruction of the house complete.  ServPro was here for 16 days demo'ing drywall, floors, etc.

We will get back to you!

<Text>Great customer service. AC went out on a over 100 degree days. Being that my wife was pregnant at the time there was no way we could go a long time without AC. I called at around 5pm and they were there promptly at 9am the next day. Butch was phenomenal. He explained what was needed to fix the unit and gave me multiple options. Very satisfied with there service will probably be back to order a whole new AC unit.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This is a first for me—leaving a negative review. But I am at a loss and feel it worth it so others do not have almost two months of their lives wasted waiting on heat.
I have a home warranty, and for very good reason. Many of my home systems are nearing the end of their working lives. I am a single parent and am on a tight budget, so it’s very important that I cover all of my bases. When I called in my heater issue (the pilot was not igniting the furnace), I was connected with Air Tech. They scheduled a visit for one week out, which I thought odd considering  it’s winter and most people would like a prompt response to get heat going as soon as possible. Fast forward to that day and the contractor had a family emergency and would have to reschedule. I was again put off for another week. When a contractor finally came out, he was kind, but also very much like a used car salesman. I was quickly thrown into a sales pitch for their service plan, as home warranty companies “tend to look more highly on homeowners with service plans...”. I let him know I was prepared to pay the $75 service call fee, but was not about to throw down $180 for a service plan—right before Christmas. He talked about this repeatedly, and I was as polite in my declining as possible. But it was not a comfortable situation. He did spend a good amount of time diagnosing the issue, and seemed to drag his feet a bit regarding what should be done. I was told multiple times that it was going to cost quite a bit due to codes needing to be addressed, and that I’d likely get less than acceptable repairs due to my use of the home warranty company. What an odd statement...
It then took another few weeks (!) to get the next guy out to take measurements for a new system as the parts the first guy suggested are now obsolete. The second guy was another hard sale walking through the door. Not only did he suggest i’d get things done more quickly if I ditched my home warranty and went with them directly (for thousands more dollars!!), but also that he’d spoken to his boss and could get me “special financing”!!! Really?!?! Asking me to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket rather than the $75 service fee I pay BECAUSE I have the forethought to have a yearly home warranty plan? That makes ZERO sense. His biggest selling point? He could get it done sooner. I wouldn’t have to “wait for authorizations” from my home warranty company.
Here’s the kicker: My home warranty company contacted me multiple times between visits and calls to make sure Air Tech was following up. They were concerned at the hard selling and were very apologetic to me for the many inconveniences I’d experienced with Air Tech. They were not understanding the multiple hold ups in the process that were THE FAULT OF Air Tech.
We tried to give Air Tech an opportunity to complete this service. But, after being cancelled, rescheduled, un-cancelled, then cancelled again this morning, I am finished with this company. Moving on to a more ethical contractor. Ugh...thank you for keeping my three kids and I “in the cold” for almost two months Air Tech.<//Text>

Ronnie was amazing. Came and helped us with our 2 units at our shop. He was precise, told us exactly what we needed and did not try to oversell us.  He was on top of additional things we can do now to save us money in the long run and had our shop up and running with ac blowing cold again in no time!

Our 27-year old heat pump died at the start of a heat wave. I searched the web for reputable HVAC installers in El Dorado County.  Believe it or not, I read all 56 reviews to learn what customers thought of their experience. with Air Tech  In researching heat pumps, most authors on the web stressed the importance of a quality installation as many of the unit manufacturers on the market produce reliable units for sale in the high end, middle range, and budget sectors.  Air Tech consistently was praised for their quality installations.  We left an emergency email on their website and they called us the next morning.  Their salesman came by that afternoon and did an assessment of the existing system, confirmed that the compressor had died, and evaluated our needs.  He came by our house the next evening to present our options to us.  He was professional, patient, and informative without being pushy or up-selling. The installation crew was scheduled for Monday morning and showed up right on time. The old unit was hauled away and the new unit installed and operational in 2-days flat. All work was professionally finished and the lead installer walked us through the whole system including initializing the Nest smart controller before they left.  I highly recommend Air Tech HVAC to anyone in western El Dorado County considering installation of a new HVAC unit.<//text>

<Review>Technician Mike was on time, which speaks volume to me. I was having my 2 air conditioner units maintenance service. Mike was very through and explained everything he was doing. There was an issue with one of the units which was kind of disturbing consider it is a new home and we moved in 3 years ago. Mike was very helpful in letting me know what my options are in order to get the problem resolved. I would definitely call AirTech again when needed.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate><UserId.>101171352459200921700<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x809a50bf285b81c3:0xaf0247bad6e5ba5</gmap_id><resp>None</resp>< Name>

<Review>We have used Air Tech since we moved to NorCal 30 yrs ago. They have always been very helpful and professional. Today Steve N. made a house call to help us with our Nest thermostat. He was efficient, kind and quick to finish the job. Very knowledgeable. I would recommend Air Tech to anyone that asks. Thank you Air Tech for your professionalism.

AirTech was very professional on the phone and updated us on the arrival of our tech Butch.
When Butch arrived he was very professional and courteous.
He started troubleshooting our system sand found some issues that were missed by another company’s tech 2 weeks earlier.  Butch was efficient and prompt and cleaned up at himself.  If we ever have anymore issues we will be calling AirTech for our service.

Replaced my 30 year old furnace ducts. Air Tech was very thorough and did an excellent job. First good thing was a responsive and pleasant office person, Sarah who arranged for the inspection and schedule. The senior tech was very knowledgeable and the install crew was hard working, courteous and cleaned up when finished. Very pleased with Air Techs service and definitely recommend them.</review>

<Review>AirTech was very professional on the phone and updated us on the arrival of our tech Butch.
When Butch arrived he was very professional and courteous.
He started troubleshooting our system sand found some issues that were missed by another company’s tech 2 weeks earlier.  Butch was efficient and prompt and cleaned up at himself.  If we ever have anymore issues we will be calling AirTech for our service.

<Review>The stars are for the technician. He was very knowledgeable and even called someone about the problem.  My frustration is with this unit. We were told by another company that the unit is too old for repair. The technician from yesterday agreed. However we are not sure what the next step will be. Waiting patiently.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I have been an Air Tech customer for close to 8 years.  Very happy customer up until now.
I had Air Tech do a HVAC tuneup at my rental in Woodland.  The tenant had said that airflow in the bathroom was extremely poor.  The tuneup was completed and the repairman said that the compressor in the attic needed to be replaced.  So I spent almost $1,000 to get that replaced.  The tenant reported that the airflow was the same.
So, I have called Air Tech over a dozen times asking to get this resolved.  I have been promised several times that Bill, the VP, would contact me.  He called me once, left a message and has done nothing since then.  I have called back 3 times asking him to call me.
So my advise is to NOT pay until you make sure the work is done.  Very unhappy that I have been ignored for almost 2 months.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x809a50bf285b81c3:0xaf0247bad6e5ba5< /GmapID><Rate>1< /Rate><username>Kristen Petersen</username><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Called mid-day with a leak problem on my indoor AC unit which was leaking on my carpet and coming close to my laminate flooring. They were able to get me in that afternoon by rearranging their schedule. A message was sent  to me letting me know who my tech would be including his picture! What a great idea!  Ronnie was prompt, quick, identified the problem, and gave me some pointers on taking care of my system. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for an AC service company.< /review>

<text>Thank You Butch from Air Tech!
I have been trying to get the condensation liNE for my air conditioning unit unblocked for months! Because the line was on the roof, 16 different companies refused to do it 😕 Butch did not even hesitate and was done in a very short amount of time, not to mention he drove all the way from Placerville to Carmichael to get on the roof! I am so grateful! I will recommend you guys to EVERYONE!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>Chris our Tech was prompt and courteous.
We have had an ongoing problem for over a year
He patiently listened to my whole description and tested the system. Several previous attempts had failed to keep our system  from having a failure.
Chris checked with the manufacturer of our system and invited me to watch as he checked by a different approach. It seems our unit was early production and later models had been fitted with another management tool. A thermostat for the brain basically.
He installed this new part today and I feel this will finally fix our unit</Text>< Name>

<Text>Ronnie did a great job; was very thorough and is also very personable. The only glitch was that we were informed that he would be here soon at around 1:40 PM and he did not arrive until 3:30 PM   The original window that was given to us by the dispatcher was 11 AM to 2 PM, so because of that,  it was a little frustrating.</Text>< pictures>

We started using Air Tech a few years ago for checkup and maintenance on our furnace-A/C.  Our system is older, and has been having problems.  Air Tech's field technicians are knowledgeable and friendly.  Brian, the tech who checked the system the last two times, gave us updates (supported by photographs) of its deterioration, and made necessary repairs  to keep the system running a little longer.  On his recent visit, he showed us damage that cannot be ignored.  We are having Air Tech replace the system based on the very satisfactory service we received from Brian and the rest of the Air Tech staff who have helped us.

This is a follow-up to my previous post.  Air Tech installed the new furnace about eighteen months ago.  They did the job promptly and professionally.  Today a technician, Jeramie, was out to do a checkup on the system under our club membership.  He reported the system is fine, answered my questions, and discussed some work that will need to be done to our A/C before deep summer. I'm still fully satisfied with the professionalism and competence of the Air Tech team.</review>

<Review>JASON has the best customer service I have ever experienced when it comes to HVAC I have dealt with other companies and wanted to put good words in for not only him but the crew with him as well.

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Air Tech recently did an amazing job with a whole home service inspection I wanted to get done before it gets hot. They scheduled the inspection appointment quickly, were on time when they arrived, and the technicians were very polite and courteous, and the cost was minimal. The technicians pointed out a few areas that could be improved and didn't require service. To save a few bucks I asked for suggestions and it was easy enough for a homeowner to handle. With a clean bill of service and ways to improve the systems efficiency, it's great to know I can trust these guys. I will be going back to them for all my HVAC needs and to when it's time to upgrade to a new whole home system as well. Thanks Air Tech!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Ronnie did a great job; was very thorough and is also very personable. The only glitch was that we were informed that he would be here soon at around 1:40 PM and he did not arrive until 3:30 PM   The original window that was given to us by the dispatcher was 11 AM to 2 PM, so because of that,  it was a little frustrating.</Review><resp>None</resp><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>$95 wasted. If you just want someone to come by to make a house call and collect your money then call these guys. I was told that I would have a tech come out for a tune up of my furnace/ac.... Well the guy that came out was super friendly, however he was on my roof for only 5-10 minutes... Apparently to just check the pressure of the system(this is all he did).. I was told by the lady on the phone that they would clean the coils (they weren't touched) and it would be more in depth than that. Tech said that he wouldn't recommend cleaning them as they look fine. Which I have lived in this home for three years and the ac/furnace hasn't EVER been touched so I'm sure he just didn't want to clean them. What has happened to quality service? It's now like companies just take advantage of customers and try to get away with doing as little as possible rather than doing the right thing, which is provide the full service they are paying for. I guess next time I'll find a YouTube video along with some of my own time to clean it myself.<//text><gmapID>0x809a50bf285b81c3:0xaf0247bad6e5ba5<//gmapID>< Date>

I don't love when I have to buy a new HVAC system, but when I have to do so, I appreciate professionalism from start to end.  That's just what you get with Air Tech.  I replaced 3...yes 3...units in under 2 years.  I used Air Tech for all 3 systems.  Randy is a great, approachable guys that determines which system is right for you.  Kelsey in the office really gets things done.  When you need to repair or replace your system, call Air Tech!</Review>

After having a new hot water heater installed, we noticed a decrease in water pressure from several faucets throughout our house. Steve came out and talked me through the reasons why sediment pushes through the lines and was able to clear out the debris in a matter of minutes. Thanks to Steve for restoring our water pressure and helping educate me on the process!<//Text>

Air Tech came highly recommended by family members and friends that had work done for them. I'm not one to normally write reviews,  but I'm writing this one with pleasure for the project Air Tech performed at our residence. Every person we dealt with  (from the first visit with Randy to each and every installer or office support person that had a part of the process) was courteous, professional and truly worked as a team putting the customer first. I would recommend these  guys to anyone that was thinking of having any HVAC, solar or windows installed.< /review>

I had new AC, Furnace, pool pump and solar installed. Randy is the guy that got the ball rolling, he really knows his stuff and installed the confidence in me to trust him. Randy laid out why I needed to get the repairs/upgrades done together for better rebates, he made a lot of sense. Every phase was done by professional, clean cut, well-spoken installers with great attitudes. I couldn't be happier with the job they did.</Review>

Everyone I come into contact with from Air Tech are extremely polite and they go out of their way to accommodate and communicate.   I really like how they assign a tech to a customer, the tech becomes familiar with the customer and the unit, and vice versa.  Highly recommend Air Tech!< /Text>

I had new AC, Furnace, pool pump and solar installed. Randy is the guy that got the ball rolling, he really knows his stuff and installed the confidence in me to trust him. Randy laid out why I needed to get the repairs/upgrades done together for better rebates, he made a lot of sense. Every phase was done by professional, clean cut, well-spoken installers with great attitudes. I couldn't be happier with the job they did.<//review>

<text>We experienced the worst storm so far this season. We had a medium of 6 different power outages through the evening and into the morning hours. We woke to a house that was 55 degrees, some things up. The heater was off, I checked out our HVAC, it was of line. I consulted with AirTech  of the problem we were having with the HVAC system that they had installed the year before last. They informed me that a technician would be there in the afternoon. First thing I thought was no way was this going to happen with the storm we had just experience. I expect a phone call later that day that they would reschedule for the next day. Not the case, just as they had stated I got a text from there technician Jason that afternoon that he was on his way. Huge relief, but unfortunately because all the power surges several components were damaged. Parts are ordered, repair is being scheduled. During the hour that Jason was diagnosing the problem that he was finding he was informative, professional, and tried to comfort us that AirTech warranty would cover there responsibilities all the time searching out the issues
Up Date,
New components and surge protectors have been installed. Greatly appreciate the efforts of AirTech to get our heat back on.
Thank you AirTech / Jason!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1556737240562, 'text': "Hi Jack! Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us.

Air Tech repaired our AC recently and we couldn't have been more pleased with both their service and the technicians they sent out.  They were prompt and completed the repairs.  The office staff called several times to check on how things were going.  Would recommend this company.</text>

<name>John Huegli<//name><Text>Air Tech really came through with excellent service and a great price.  The air conditioner in my rental was blowing warm air.  This was the second time in two years that the refrigerant leaked out.  The company that I bought the unit from, 9 years earlier, and who I signed a service contract with for periodic tune-up, never gave it a thought to find the leak.  Every year I was spending $500 on the old unit.  Rather than continue with the original AC supplier I called a Air Tech.  The Air Tech technician found, and demonstrated to me, several major problems with my original unit.  For a few thousand  dollars more I was able to replace my old unit.  All of this within a week.  My tenants and I are both happy with the results.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Cory is experienced, punctual and professional.  Cory took the time to answer all of the questions in depth. There was no fluff but plenty of facts about how the HVAC system works. Great guidance in  what should be repaired or maintained. His knowledge and his ability to explain systems makes it easy for the owners/buyers to make informed decisions.
He knows the industry and it's history.  He is not weighted towards any one brand.  As a contractor in the past, and as a real estate agent in the present, I have worked with hundreds of builders, inspectors and subcontractors and Cory stands out as one of the best in his industry.

Excellent Customer Service.... Very Friendly.... My air conditioner went out a few nights ago (very hot at night) called them and left a message and they called me first thing the following morning. Had a tech out a few hours later. The tech was on time and explained everything he was doing and why  my air conditioner went out. I felt bad for the tech it was so hot outside but he still did his job and got my air conditioner up and running fast. I would highly recommend Air Tech. Thank you Air Tech so much for your fast response and your best customer service. 😊😊 Very Happy and nice and cool. 😊😊< /text>

HIRE THIS COMPANY AT YOUR OWN RISK. We contracted for a complete HVAC change out to high efficiency Mini-Splits. The contract specified the SEER that was to be installed. Not only did they install lower SEER units, they did it so poorly that we had to go to the manufacturer to see why we suddenly had huge power bills. The units didn't meet code, they didn't pull permits (but charged us for them and couldn't produce them when we asked) plus we have now had to spend thousands of dollars to get the installation corrected. Too late we found they had a BBB rating of F.<//text>

We had an excellent experience working with Air Tech HVAC. They replaced our entire system: ducts, air, furnace, etc. They were professional, nice, and thorough. When the house didn't pass the first time to earn the PG&E efficiency rebates, they were quick about getting the system efficient enough to pass the second time. I would highly recommend working with them.<//text>

< Review>
My heating/cooling unit went off warranty several years ago so I called Air Tech to have someone look it over, make sure all is working as it should.  DJ responded, checked it out, found a part that needed replacing and promptly did so. He then checked the duct system, took photos of the damage he found to the insulation, then discussed all with me. He explained results of the new part added, needs and cost of the new ducting. I ok'd the work needed and was told when the 2-man crew would be at my home to start the work. Tom and Jeremy were prompt, did the work with the parts they had, cleaned up, and came the next morning with more parts needed. All-in-all, they spent about 6 or 7 hours on the work, cleaned up, and were done. All 3 of these gentlemen were professional, offering suggestions, and did what was needed. I later called the office, spoke to Kelsey about the follow-up, and she explained the process to me. I rate this business 5 stars and appreciate their caring attitudes and professionalism.< /Review>

Excellent company, excellent people and excellent product.  Randy Anderson and his crew just completed an entire HVAC system redesign and install for our 32 year old home. After receiving nine different bids, we selected Air Tech not only for their price but for their attention to detail and superior design.  Mr. Anderson said his goal was to "over deliver" and he did!  We have never been so comfortable in our home.  I will recommend this company to everyone.<//Review>

My mother and father's air conditioner stopped working and I called a number of HVAC companies none of which were able to come out on the same day. I called Air Tech and Mella (sp?) answered my call with the utmost courtesy and professionalism. I asked if it was possible to have a tech come out. She looked and said there was a possibility. I explained how my father had just suffered 2 strokes and the AC is a need for them.  Corey the tech who came out was great fixed the issue within a few minutes took payment and my parents were cool again.  High praise to Air Tech and their great service and assistance.</review>

<Text>Chris Holt was very punctual, even early.  He called first to let me know he was on his way, and once he arrived was polite, thorough, completely checked out my AC system, ordered the part and scheduled installation the next day.  Air Tech HVAC did a great job. I would definitely recommend them to friends & neighbors.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Excellent customer service. Air conditioner went out on the hottest night. They were able to squeeze us in the next day at 3:30. Took 30 minutes and we were back in business! Will use them again.< /Review>

One call, service personal at our site in 2 hours...fixed it expertly
and efficiently at a price that was reasonable.  These people
know what they are doing and how to get it done.  Some of the
units were 19 years old...had the parts on the truck.  All I can
say is if you want someone to do it right, on time with fresh parts
and a nice personal touch...call them...they are fine.</Text>

These guys are no joke. They're work was errorless and beautiful. I am in the middle of a remodel on my home and all the different contractors from HVAC, roofers, & painters that have been in my home the last 4 months. This company was by far the most professional and they cared about installing my windows perfectly. Scale of 1 to 10, I give them a 15. Dustin and Josh thank you again for your mastercraftsmenship. These guys deserve a bonus. Will definitly refer to friends and family.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I have two HVAC systems that were installed and are serviced, bi-annually  by Air Tech. through a yearly service contract. My last service call was a week ago. The technician, Corey, as always was very professional, polite, efficient and knowledgeable. He covered all facets of both systems, checking for any possible problem areas that, if fixed now, would likely save me cost, worry, and discomfort if ignored.
I would highly recommend Air Tech, and Corey, in particular, for excellent, caring service.<//Text>< pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>It’s been one nightmare after the next with this company. We got a new ACand upgraded our heater with them last year. So far both systems don’t work right and in the 1.5 years since installation, they’ve had to come out to fix both systems multiple times. Currently sitting in the cold with my 3 kids and Air Tech is closed. I left a voicemail but so far no call back.  I’m so tired of it and wish I could start all over with someone else.<//text>< date>

They were on time for every appointment scheduled. They cleaned up after themselves at the end of each days' work. Very pleased with the new system.< /review>

After speaking with AirTech at the Sacramento Home and Garden show, they were eager to facilitate a chance for my business, which is beyond their normal operating demographic. They weren’t the lowest bid acquired, however; because of a courteous and informational visit with Randy Anderson who listened to what I specifically wanted and then assured me they could deliver as desired, we agreed to hire AirTech for our HVAC overhaul and energy efficiency work.

Five minutes after the installation crew arrived, they started instructing my wife that they could not install the HVAC system as desired. They put on their protective booties in the house but left them outside blowing around the property upon leaving.  Debris was left indiscriminately and we suffered a flat tire because of nails left on the driveway. Additionally, the crew broke the house water line four times during installation.

They returned several times over a five-month period and during the hottest period of the year, and the first time operating the new AC unit, it just blew hot air. We contacted AirTech, as this was not acceptable and were scheduled for service four days out. The first service technician found the transport-packaging fan strapping still attached to the condenser unit.

To date, five months after commencement of the job, the work is still not complete per the contract but rest assured the company’s management does not care about the contract or customer service they portray on their webpage. I assure you, they will not do everything in their power to ensure you are satisfied with their work, as advertised.

The personnel were all pleasant and personable yet lacking integrity to do the job well.</text>

Don’t use Air Tech.  They installed a whole new system for us for around 15k and 2 years later it was already leaking and they wanted another 3k to fix it.  They installed it and bailed and now don’t stand by their work.</review>

Start to finish, our experience with everyone at AirTech was exceptional.  They were on time, tidy, hard working and always professional.  Our job required extra time and a fair amount of ingenuity which the Air Tech team handled with ease.  We highly recommend AirTech.<//review>

The techs came out the same day I called which was a relief. They found 2 tiny leaks in my AC system in about 10 minutes. I have had AC work done a few times before, and no one else could find any. They had me fixed up and running in under an hour.<//Review>

<Text>I was happy from start to finish with the work Air Tech Pro's did all except
the removal of the debris from the front of my house, which included the
air conditioner and heating unit , sheet metal, ducting, wiring, cardboard
boxes and another air conditioner from another job which was yesterday.
All this junk is still siting in the street. I was told Friday that another
truck would come by to pick it up within two hours. No one showed up and as of today I was told by the answering service that they do not work
on the weekends and the office is closed. I had the new units installed on
a Friday and of now on Saturday no one has contacted me. I was scheduled to have someone come out on Wednesday of next week. I called 6 times to get it taken care of today Saturday 6-5-2021. Our contract stated they would remove the debris. It did not say it would be next week. This is a very unprofessional job not to clean up afterwards.< /Text>< gmapID>
