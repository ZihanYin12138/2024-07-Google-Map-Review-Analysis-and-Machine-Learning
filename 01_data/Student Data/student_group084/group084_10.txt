We came back to Howard’s to look at their LG all in one units. They had the best price and also would of priced match if need be. Joseph Muniz was so helpful told us all the rebates available and helped us to make sure we were getting the best price<//Review>

<rate>3<//rate><text>Horrrible, terrible service.  This business takes no accountability.  They installed my new Speed Queen washer with the Cold setting running Hot and vice versa. I did not realize this until I washed a brand new expensive pillow using Cold for the very first time. After the washer filled, I came back and realized it was steaming Hot, which ruined the brand new pillow that requires Cold wash. Furthermore, when I called, the employee denied Howard's has any responsibility to pay for the pillow or fix the incorrect installation performed by their technicians.  I asked to speak to the manager, and he was too busy to talk to me. I left my number, and the manager did not call back.  I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for your appliance.
Update: Howard's did get back to me and rectify the situation. They sent a  technician out at no charge to fix the hot/cold hook-ups. I was promised a check to cover the pillow. So I appreciate the follow-up. Upgrading from one to three stars for follow-up. The actual washing machine has been good so far. I always wanted a Speed Queen, and it is what I expected it would be.< /text>< pics>

Excellent and better product selection in terms of quality, not quantity.

<Text>Saleem was a great salesmen and sold me on a lesser priced refrigerator that he had in stock which was as nice a our GE Monogram. Called often on his own volition to see how installation was going and followed up. Installation was good.....they were a little late and and made me wait but delivery in Covid must be tough. The delivery guys did redeem themselves and installed the Kitchenaide Fridge efficiently and with precision...it was a huge refrigerator 48 by 84 and they got it in the house without any problems, hooked it up and showed me the features. The kick plate was not completely manufactured to specs but delivery and Saleem coordinated and I expect it to be installed per their representations in the next few days. Overall a pretty good experience and great follow up and communication with Howards.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>First of all, I had gone to five other places prior to going to Howard’s.  They didn’t have exactly what I wanted.  The earliest I could possibly get what I wanted would have been six plus weeks later.  When I arrived at Howard’s I was immediately impressed with the store.  I was professionally approached by Carlos Arias who was one of the finest sales person I have come across in my many years of shopping.  He is a world class act.  He didn’t pressure me and was very understanding.  He worked with me from beginning to end.  He exceeded all of my expectations.  I thought I had about one week before I would receive my washer and dryer.  Not so, to my surprise he informed me that I was getting my washer and dryer the following day.  I love everything about Howard’s, the service and the price.   I am so glad my friend told me about Howard’s.  I highly recommend them.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1616463567993, 'text': 'Hi Karola, We can’t thank you enough for the kind words.

I ordered a full set of appliances from Home Depot over two months ago and there delivery service scheduled us 3 times and never showed up.  I need the appliances for a vacation rental that was remodeled and the tenant arrives in a few days with no appliances.  Home Depot has completely screwed me and they don’t care.  So I called Howard’s and Christopher was able to get me all my appliances delivered the next day.    Needless to say I will never order from Home Depot appliance department again!!!   However I am strongly recommending you shop at your local family owned Howard’s Appliance store in Torrance to get great pricing and wonderful customer service with respect.   They also price match if it’s within 30 days!   Thank you Howard’s for taking the stress out of dealing with Home depot appliances ever again!!</Text>

<Text>The whole process at the Torrance location was great. From the knowledgeable sale associate, Anita, who called a few days later after delivery to check that we were satisfied with our purchase and service.
To the delivery associates.
Delivery was scheduled sooner than expected.
Thought Covid-19 would have delayed delivery for 4 weeks but delivery was scheduled within days.The delivery associates were on time, courteous, finished in a timely manner and left no sign of being there.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

John Bondoc our sales rep provided excellent service on the kitchen aid suite of appliances throughout the process — and when there was a delivery delay he went the extra mile to keep us posted, and later negotiated with the delivery company to have it arrive in the specific time slot we needed. He knew the products well enough to suspect a measuring snafu on my part, followed up, educated me and fixed it.

Later when the double ovens required special fittings, and the installer was expert at his job and the extra charges were modest and more than fair.

The delivery crew was also careful with our floors and customer oriented with a special request. 5 stars. (My only irk was the 3-month delay on the fridge delivery which was initially slated for November, but the same was true at Best Buy and was due to manufacturer’s backlogs stemming from covid.)<//Text>

I was able to choose what day I wanted it delivered, and the pair of guys, wearing gloves and masks, came in and quickly pulled my old stove out and set up my new one.   They were so fast, it took longer to remove all the protective plastic film than it did to install the actual stove!!

My experience on 4.21.2020 was not great at all.
The driver damaged my home and literally said " you can call the store they won't do nothing " . He claimed I signed a waiver, I didn't. He claimed he told me about minor nicks and scratches during delivery,  he didn't.
I have called the store in Torrance over and over but yet to speak with a manager. Seems so unethical to run a business this way. If you value your home use Costco or Sam's Club they are better in my opinion!!< /review>

<Review>I'll be honest, I was skeptical at first since I thought Howard's was not as big as Home Depot or Lowes but....I was proven wrong. I have purchased 2 sets of washer and dryer plus a full set of kitchen appliances. My mom also bought a full set of kitchen appliances. And recently due to an emergency I needed a second small washer and Anita was so helpful. I'm am very very happy with my purchases as well as the great help the employees provide.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd4a5a3d048a43:0xf8d9ef3ab0e9a8e9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Text>I visited the TORRANCE store today regarding a warranty issue on a coin operated washer I had bought a few years back. I spoke to Frank and after hearing what I had to say, his response was, “I can help you with that.” Within less than an hour, Frank solved my problem.  I truly appreciate Frank’s effort in helping me, especially after spending an hour on the phone earlier in the day trying to resolve the problem, to no avail I might add. Frank’s efforts turned me into a return customer for sure.

I also wanted to mention that I recently bought two other appliances from the Torrance store. Chai was the rep that helped me. He made the transaction very pleasant and he was very knowledgeable on what I was purchasing. He informed me of all the specials associated with my purchase, which actually led me to purchase an additional appliance.<//Text>< response>

This was my first time shopping at Howard's Appliance.  I needed a new refrigerator and stove/oven as my old ones had lived a long and useful life. Howard's had a large variety to look through which included items which fit my budget and technical expertise.  Oz was really knowledgeable and explained the advantages and disadvantages of various appliances to me.  Delivery was within the time frame and set up was fast.  I'm very happy with Howard's.<//text>

Lynnette and I just returned from Customer Appreciation evening at Howard's (catered meal outside).  A great young man, Chai Harter sold Lynnette her dream oven (which she had been researching for a month.) We went in with the model number and measurements (not available elsewhere) and the price was right.  We liked that they are certified and were overjoyed that Howard's had an oven that fit in our space. Chai and everyone there is amazing!  After the meal, we also bought their inside rolling air conditioner.  We are cool and loving it too.<//Review>

I initially contacted Howard's by phone. Oz Cruz, the salesman, was well informed about models. sizes etc.  I was treated as if my phone call was just as important as a customer in the store. He wanted to be sure all my questions were answered. He gave me directions to the store if I chose to make the purchase. Because of his demeanor on the phone I did return and the same quality of service continued  with his help negotiating the rebate process, making copies for me, explaining how the delivery would be made etc.  I left the store feeling that all the details had been reviewed thoroughly and I felt very comfortable with the purchase.<//Text>

She gave me a few options on getting finance. I was approved in seconds. When I came into the Torrance location everyone was very friendly. I informed the specialist that Anita helped me over the phone and Anita was there ready and very helpful. I purchased a Whirlpool Refrigerator with the help of Anita which was very informative  ..... I also ask about price matching, she was able to price match. (Great Savings) My family and I are very happy with choosing Howard's Electronics.

I would like to give an enormous thank you to Anita from Howards Appliance's  in Torrance for helping make right, the purchase of a defective Maytag washer. Anita cares about her customers. She also possesses excellent product knowledge so you feel confident about what you are purchasing.

Howard's was the first place I went to in order to buy a new stove top oven and microwave today! I was really impressed and pleased with Rene Chavarria who helped us with all the information I needed in order to make the right decision! He's super friendly and knows his products! I really appreciate all of the tips he gave me as well! If you decide to go to Howard's, go see Rene Chavarria! He is the BEST!!! Thank you so much Rene!!!<//Review>

We ordered a new cooktop on a Sunday for delivery and installation the following Saturday. Howard's said that the installer would call us Friday evening to give us a time range.  My husband called late Friday afternoon, and the installer said they would call Friday evening.  By 8:30 p.m., no one had called, so I called Howards.  No one picked up the phone, so I left a voice mail.  At 10:15 p.m., the installer finally called and didn't give us a time range, but the time of 5 p.m.  The installer had to cut our granite, and they didn't have a shop vac and asked if they could use our Dyson vacuum cleaner and ruined our Dyson vacuum cleaner.  The Dyson spits out the granite dust and won't pick up anything.  Terrible terrible service.</text>

<text>Well, I asst. mg @ this location, so I'm surely biased. This yr we have a new mgr & he brought along his freight to join our DT family. If our store appeared slummin' in the past, it surely's not anymore. Fully stocked w/ your fav name brands (@ a quarter of the price), our generic merch (same taste, functionality & quality as other stores, once more noticeably cheaper) & friendly staff make a visit our way a must. Pls put the stigma of a discount store out of your mind & come check our location out.<//text><Name>Scorned Scorpio!<//Name><response>None<//response>< Time>

<review>I ordered through their website to be delivered to the store. When I went to pick it up they told me they couldn't find it and would look for it. I called the next day and he said they don't think they received it. I called the online number and they said it was delivered last week. The item is now out of stock so I can't even reorder it. Do not have things delivered to the store!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Date>1574799297504<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Great service, the employee's are always helpful and great variety in just about any and everything.
Only thing is my son and I go just about every day, so we have done plenty of shopping ($$) out... With all the receipts and surveys we have taken, you would think we would have won "some" money after all the years of shopping!! But....one day I hope!!

< Review>
I have  never had a bad experience at Dollar Tree. I am always able to find something I can use be it for my grandchildren or myself. Have had good luck with finding cleaning products and the selection of greeting cards is excellent a d the price is right. Hope you enjoy your visit.

You can find so many interesting things here on the cheap. I can't say the quality is great but for items that don't require the highest quality, your best bargains are here. The staff has always been helpful as well. Especially good deals on greeting cards and party supplies</text>

Although we could not have known the battery we replaced had a bad cel, the trust you placed in us to return to Thomas Acura to diagnose the vehicle and find the source of the electrical draw from aftermarket components makes me feel so proud of our team.\n\nMany, many thanks Mrs. Saito.

February 2020 I took my car for maintenance and they replaced the battery and it was under warranty. Almost a year passed and I won’t be able to start my car. First, I jumped the start and it worked. The second time, my husband had to call AAA and he was told the battery is a bad cell. I called them to see what’s going on and they said it shouldn't be a battery issue since the battery lasts about 3 years and it could be something draining or having wiring issues. I also got into a car accident on December and maybe the damage was caused by the accident. Anyway, I ended up having my mechanic investigate and she gave me a report saying it’s electronic issue. Anyway, she thought Acura gave me a bad battery.  it cost me $300 to get a new battery.

After leaving the review, Mark from Acura left me a voice message. After a phone conversation, he offered me to take a look at my car to make sure everything is okay. We made an appointment on Monday.

After talking to Mark at the office, he explained very well what could be the cause of the issues. I didn’t want to have any more headaches in the future so I’m glad they are going to diagnose. He also said he can try to see if he can recover the old battery.

After about 45 mins of waiting in the lobby comfortably, Mark came back and told me that there is something going on with my car as the new battery is draining. He told me it will take some time to find out what’s the cause and he was very nice to offer me a loaner car for free of charge. I took a loaner car and he called me back around 3 pm. They were able to find out the cause!!!!! Also, they weren’t able to recover the old battery.

There is a couple of issues -
1) This is a minor issue but the dashcam I have was draining sown battery and they were able to adjust

2) There was a security or alert box next to the fuse box - and this was causing the issues! I had no idea there was! I guess the dealership I got a car from didn’t take it out when they sold the car!!!!! - the dealership closed permanently for god sake.

Anyway, I am very happy they were able to find the cause and fixed it. I really appreciate their sincere offer for all of this. A lot of dealerships is trying to take advantage but I feel like Thomas Acura is different. They make sure that you are taking care very well. They even gave me a 2022 TLX as a loaner car!!! Thank you!!<//Text>

I was in and out within an hour with a courtesy car wash and vacuum, where most dealers just do a wash.   Thanks Team Thomas Acura and especially kudos to Jimmy for taking care of the service needs, quickly, efficiently and of course with quality.  WiFi helped out as well since I was able to do some office work and they have extra desk/tables to be able to work while you wait.

One recommendation is to have extra outlets for all the electrical needs of the customers. Thankfully didn’t need it since I was in and out.

Until next time.<//review>< rate>

Jimmy in service department was very helpful and kept me informed on the progress of my car and kept me updated. The service department was very accommodating with a free loaner vehicle as well while my TLX was being serviced since I do live kind of a ways out. My vehicle took half the time they told me it would take so definitely a plus side that they were able to service my vehicle so fast as well. Thank you Thomas Acura service department and Jimmy for the great customer service! Will definitely be bringing my car back for service.<//Text>

<Review>DO NOT go to Thomas Acura. This dealer charged me $14 for the remote control battery for my 2008 Acura RDX. I called Acura Montclair and it’s only $6 that’s a rip off. I also asked for the door latch assembly for the same car the price is $89 but Montclair price is $82. This dealer did my 100K miles maintenance because it’s closer to home 6 months ago they charged me around $800 I hope that’s not a lot. I’m not gonna go back to this dealer anymore. If they charge a lot on parts I’m very sure they will do that on service maintenance too. Go somewhere else.< /Review>< pictures>

Great service at Metro Acura! They are very communicative in letting you know updates regarding your car once you bring it in for servicing. I love how my car is always vacuumed and washed after my service.</review>

Great Interaction with Internet Sales Manager Ryan Mohr. Very patient, friendly, and did not try to upsell like other dealerships do. If you want a comfortable and hassle free car buying experience then go see Ryan at Thomas Acura. Mark Giles Director of Operations has taken care of my service needs and also has a mild mannered disposition that puts you at ease  Both gentlemen are true professionals at what they do and I highly recommend Thomas Acura for new or used vehicles. When you do go tell them that you saw my review and that Carlo Cristobal sent you.</Text>

He was just great.  So was Rachel in finance, she made the prose smooth and quick and easy.  If you need your car serviced, see Alan, the guy is super nice.  The showroom was clean and everyone wore masks.  The whole experience was simple and quick and I would recommend Thomas Acura to anyone.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

These guys always help me out. I've had the rottenest luck with my two Acuras this time around. Both have required a new battery and both have required a new tire due to flats that could not be patched. Guess what? Another tire issue today brought me in. Slow leak. Luckily, it was fixable and they patched it right up, all under an hour and a half with a quick outside car wash. (It was really getting embarrassing to drive that thing! Thanks, guys!) Oh, and I drove up this afternoon without an appointment and they were able to accommodate me. How's that for service? Jimmy and the guys do an outstanding job. Keep up the great work, you guys. You're the reason I keep coming back, just so you know. I could go to Acura of Alhambra but I drive a little farther to bring my Acuras here instead. I followed Simon over here and was glad to see a few familiar faces made it over here as well. We've built a real great relationship over these last few years. I'm sure you'll love the sales and service here and will become a regular like me.< /text>

Very pleased with Jimmy Hwang’s service . He is very polite and he takes the time to sit down with you and explain in detail all costs/repairs . He does not pressure you to buy or make any repairs and he makes you feel welcome.  As for the technicians they always finish taking care of my vehicle on time or in most cases earlier than expected. They did wash and vacuum my vehicle as a courtesy the two times that I came here without me having to ask them to which I thought was very considerate. Will be coming back here for any future repairs.<//Text>

<review>Ryan and William are the Best! Only look for them. The process for deals and finance to about 3 hours altogether. We were able to get a new Acura ILX Premium at the right budget. There is no GAP included, but has to be purchased. We purchased GAP through a Credit Union Bank at a way cheaper price. The great part was Ryan and Will made it easier to use a Credit Union Bank to make the purchase of the new car. We didn't like the first deal, but the 2nd was just right. It's always based on the bank, but they are always willing to help you get to where you need, reasonably. I will definitely work with them or will always try to look for them. Even the AAA companies recommend these guys. Thanks for the new car!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmap_id>

Delt primarily with JC in Service and Simon in Sales. Both were very helpful, honest and professional. They gave me straight forward, honest information about what we discussed but left the decisions clearly in my hands with no pressure.<//text>

JC and the whole service team is great.  Very friendly and attentive to your needs.  It’s nice to find a team you can trust who isn’t going to gauge you for extras.< /text>

We did the research on the prevailing price of Acura vehicle that we wanted.  Reached out to the dealership via website and was contacted by Simon from the dealership right away.  Agreed to the price, got the vehicle we wanted, and all the paperwork done efficiently.  Would highly recommend.</text>

<review>Came by the dealership four times to check out their available stock for new RDX and Certified TLX. Jordan Chan was really helpful and explained the positives and negatives of the three vehicles I test-drove. He wasn’t pushy and allowed me to think for myself. Overnight, I made a decision and we chatted via text and phone call to finalize the deal. Came by the dealership to pick up my car and drop off my trade in. The entire process was simple and quick. Also got a lower APR, than expected, which is nice. Extra effort. Thanks! Will be back in a few years for an RDX.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Thomas acura took good care of me. I really liked that when a mistake happens they remedy it immediately and take care of you as a customer. The service advisor Julian i believe was his name followed up and made sure i was comfortable and disclosed what to expect and broke down cost in order to prevent any confusion. Overall i would reccomend to come to Thomas acura for any parts or service. You get quality service, great customer service, and straighforward pricing.< /review>

<Review>These guys are the best Acura dealership for service in SoCal hands down. I’ve been coming here for over a year now for all my TSX needs & I’m OCD. JC is very professional & thorough explaining everything to me. Super knowledgeable. Him & the mechanics know everything about Acuras. No bs & won’t try to force you to fix or buy anything you don’t need. You guys have a customer for life or until I no longer have an Acura. Lol. But I’ll probably stick with Acuras since they’re such reliable vehicles. So if you have an Acura too, get your butts over there asap! Great prices for a dealership. 👌< /Review>< Pictures>

My MDX started to have a problem about a year ago. At the beginning when the oil mileage said 50%, my car reported “engine oil low” on very sharp turn I made. Eventually even when I made a small turn like driving in a parking lot, or just a bumpy road. I realized there was an issue and went to check with dealer. I was marketed to replace my brake oil, fine, and was told Acura has this issue and callback service. I said good, let’s do brake oil and this. No, after I did both oils they said you have to drive 500 miles and come back check. Which I did, when I returned, they said, no it is actually 1000 miles. Which I did, they said, “wow, we want your business but did you bring in a paper to mark where you started with and show us how low the engine oil is now?” What?! I never knew this part, I got a paper and refilled engine oil because I had to start over right, besides the car started to blah blah “low” again. When I went back after 1000 miles, the manager finally got bored and told me my car had no problem, he could not find the evidence that my car consumes engine oil too fast. Great news, but now my car is at 50% and started a few days ago “engine oil is low”. These guys are cheaters! I will never go to this dealer again!!!< /Review>

<review>Have my vehicle serviced here, it appears the Techs are more knowledgeable about Honda's than the Honda Dealership themselves and you won't ever feel rushed when you get your service vehicle here.

Be wary if you are not able to wait you do require pickup as shuttle services are not available due to the plandemic going on.< /review>< pictures>

As always took my mom’s car in for service.  All details of the service provided and what was needed were explained thoroughly and carefully.  My service adviser this time was Jimmy who is a very knowledgeable and cultured employee (as well as the others).   Always friendly smiles and welcoming faces.  Can’t mention everyone , but the gals in the cashiering office also are very sweet and pleasant.  Thanks again.  🙏🏻🤗Definitely would recommend Thomas Acura.</Text>

I have been going to this dealership since 6 years ago for my 2013 MDX. Car is always washed and the inspection feedback is great. They are open for you to bring your synthetic oil and filter. They have free wifi and amenities as well. Mark Giles his team is well trained. Family owned dealership.<//text>

I don't know what happened to my original review but Simon the sales person was the worst and untrustworthy I ever dealt with. I test drove one car but also wanted to try another but he blew me thinking I was only there for the grand prix tickets. Will never recommend this location. Go to Alhambra where you will be fully attended to. Mariana is great salesperson.< /Text>

We came in to look at a used car.  We called in, a sales representative, Bryan Oh, answered the call.  When we arrived, another person named Paul greeted us at the door. Bryan Oh was busy.  So he asked Paul to show us the car.  Paul was very professional and patient in answering our questions.  When Bryan was done with his other clients, he came over and explained us about the car and did test driving with us.  He did a good job to explain to us about the car and related questions.  After about 30 min discussions, we decided to buy the car.  We feel that sales reps here are very professional.  We feel we can trust them so we decide to buy car here. We also had a very pleasant interaction with the lady (think her name is Jessica) who helped us with the paper work.  Everything went very smoothly, and we only used 2.5 hours to buy a car.</review>

Loved my experience at Thomas Acura! I had the pleasure in working with Stephanie, Ryan and 2 Brian’s!  The transaction for my MDX went smoothly. From the beginning they were honest and straight forward and I  had shopped around tuns ....TA gave me the best deal !!! Hands down the BEST car buying experience I have ever had. Stephanie was so sweet and very attentive! Ryan was so knowledgeable and accommodating Brian did the final number crunch and made it work !!!! Thanks again guys you’ll definitely see me aging.<//review>

<text>What a wonderful experience!  The experience was great start to finish.  They made sure that my observations were completely recorded.  They confirmed the findings for each one.  The pricing for each repair was explained.  Promotional pricing was applied without the need for me to ask for it.  I was confident that all needed repairs were done and I didn't pay for repairs I didn't need.  Mostly, I was treated with respect at every step.  What a great improvement over other dealerships I have been to.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

< Review>
Alan Sze of Thomas Acura Car service is phenomenal!  I had my Acura years ago before I decided to go back to school. Currently, I am a single parent and a full time student therefore budget is really tight! Car service could be really expensive but having my car service done at Acura gives me the peace of mind of the quality service and care provided. The thing I love about Alan is that he listens to my needs and work around it by prioritizing the most important service that needs taking care of first and then WE work slowly on the list of things that needs to be done on my car. His top priority is the safety of my daughter and my safety and with this in mind we work on my budget on what I can take care of first. Isn't this mentality, care and consideration amazing?! Unlike other auto car service center or agent, they push too much for things to be done to your car even if they are already aware of your financial situation. Alan has gained my trust numerous times. I love him! The quality customer service he provides is one of the finest and no other. Thank you. I'll definitely get my future car from you when I get my job after I graduate. And yes he is that AWESOME and trustworthy!!< /Review>

<Name>Eric Tuazon<//Name><text>I’m impressed with the professionalism shown by the great team of people at Thomas Acura when I purchased my 2018 MDX from them. Leading the team was their Sales Manager Brian, Product Specialist Jeff and Finance Dept Ryan.

In my many years of buying and leasing upscale vehicles, I have never come across a team of honest and hard working auto professionals like this team at Thomas Acura. They truly deserve to earn your business and will patiently guide and help you make your decision on the right Acura vehicle of your choice. I highly recommend them and their wonderful dealership. Keep up the good work guys and thank you for making my purchase at Thomas Acura dealership a great experience!< /text><user>116667908465641428203< /user>< date>

Jimmy Hwang in the service department was really great and professional.  He provided regular updates on the day of service and even called a few days after to check everything was OK.  It was the best experience I have ever had at a dealership.  He explained everything very clearly and there were no surprises when it was time to pay.  Really great experience and I will recommend to people I know.</Text>

Alan is the best. Friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, takes the time to explain car issues, and trustworthy. I could take my car other places that are more convenient but I know Alan will always take care of me. He is the best!

Ed Bowling was a grest help the other day. I heard an unnerving sound and knew something was wrong with my brakes. Ed immediately took care of getting my car in and providing me a loaner car. Once again exceptional service!< /text>

I did not realize until the night before that I was double booked for my Service Appointment the following morning, so I dropped off my vehicle early without any problems and they took care of the rest. I greatly appreciated that throughout the day they were proactively updating me on the status of my vehicle. I ended up picking up my car later than expected without a hitch. Thank You Thomas Acura!< /Review>

I had an excellent experience with Thomas Acura yesterday. After work I had to get my car jumped and called Thomas Acura to see if I could bring it by for diagnostic analysis of my battery. I was told yes, and they tested my car, installed a new battery, washed and vacuumed it--after 5 p.m. when technicians would normally leave. Thanks so much to Ed, Jimmy, and the crew at Thomas Acura!</review>

The Thomas Acura team went the extra mile to accommodate my "want to have" on my RDX.  They also were extremely considerate of my time limitations.  They worked with me as though I was their only client.  Thank you to Paul, Jessica, Josh, Jeff and the others I spoke with and the gentlemen behind the scenes that added the extras I requested
I would speak highly of Thomas Acura to anyone.< /Text>

I have searched, and searched for the kind of honest service and quality repair work that I have finally found at the Thomas Acura Service Department. Not only have they taken care of me, but they have also taken care of my mother. I love this place and would highly recommend them to anyone.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I want to thank the Entire Thomas Acura team for such a smooth and pressure free buying experience. I especially want to thank Chris Fleischer who was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was professional and courteous with extensive product knowledge yest not at all pushy. While the car buying experience can sometimes be stressful, everyone at the dealership exceeded my expectations and made the deal quick and easy. One more note, I had (3) pre-approved offers and the rate the dealership offered me was even better than what i was able to obtain on the street. If you are looking for a new ride, do yourself a favor and stop by Thomas Acura.</text>< pictures>

Juan Flores (sales) & Loren Anderson (Finance Manager) made my purchase of my 2009 Acura TL most enjoyable.  There was absolutely no pressure or gimmicks involved in the entire transaction.  I would highly recommend Thomas Acura simply because of these two individuals...< /Text>

Josh was most helpful in explaining all details of the tire replacement on my Acura TLX.  Thomas Acura had a better price on the tires than anyone else. He informed me of things I did not know about my own car.  I will definitely come back to Thomas Acura in the future.<//review>

Wonderful service experience at Thomas Acura on my 2014 RLX.  Very knowledgeable services rep like Allen Sze who is always courteous and gives good advice that you can rely on.  I strongly recommend Thomas to any Acura vehicle owner who's looking for a honest and dependable dealer for all service needs.<//Review>

<review>I recently leased a new car from Thomas Acura, and all I can say is that the experience was a most pleasant one. I never felt pressured, felt that all of my requests were met, and Fernando was one of the best car dealer salesperson I have ever engaged with. It was worth the drive out from Irvine to Covina, so if you live in Southern California, give Fernando a call - and tell him Neal sent 'ya ;-)<//review><Date>1380498802225<//Date>< user_id>

I arrived at the dealership just to look at a certain car without an appointment or anything set up and I was noticed right away looking at the car by Jessica. Jessica was great!!! She was professional and courteous. She brought the key and the carfax within minutes and we talked numbers for 5-10mins and the deal was done shortly after that. Very professional and comfortable dealership. Watched football on a big screen and  had unlimited bottles of water while they detailed the car and I was on my way out very happy and satisfied.< /Text>

<review>Great experience. I live in AZ and bought car from them as it happens to be lot cheaper. While other dealership was charging CA sales tax and putting the ounce on me to file a sale-tax return form to save them from doing the paperwork. Thomas Acura said they will do the necessary paperwork and not charge me the CA-sales tax and I pay the sales-tax in AZ.

The sale person was very professional and ready with document to sign. They were prompt and did not try to sell me unwanted accessories. I wanted a Standard Car with no Accessories and they gave me that.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I purchased a 2007 MDX from these guys a few months ago. Frankly, the car has been more trouble than I expected. HOWEVER, These guys have earned my respect by standing behind it. They have made all the repairs and have never once questioned it. It is a certified Acura (so I guess they have to) but they get me a loaner when I come in and have taken care of the problems that have come up. The only thing that has been an issue is some paint stuff the sales guys swore up and down would come off and didn't. The price was I paid was the best the lowest advertised at the time from an Acura dealer (I wanted the certification for obvious reasons). So I guess in my case the service saved the sale. Since the repairs have been completed the car is running great. The only thing that has left me with sour grapes was the paint issue.... I should have got that in writing.</text>

<review>Went for B1 service and had a squealing noise in my 2016 RDX AWD when I make a U turn. My service advisor was Alan, he was friendly and knowledgable and asked a mechanic to do a test drive with me to reproduce the noise. The mechanic was very polite and not only he found the noise he explained me why its coming and fixed it.  About Alan - he exceeded my expectations and made sure that I am satisfied with the service when I was leaving the service center. He also had a follow up as well after couple of days. Its been a longtime since I had seen a service advisor like Alan and the mechanic/technician. I would strongly recommend Alan @ Thomas Acura.< /review>< pics>

I called and it was an easy 2 minute talk with Kevin. He was very nice and great guy. My dad was being rude thinking he knew all but once he talked to Kevin my dad found out he does not know everything. Kevin really knows his cars and he got us excited about buying in the next few months. If I buy is not because of the price but because of the features Kevin showed us the car has. Almost a self-drive car lol what? ...<//text>

They could be clearly heard from the other room saying that my brother had issues and would not even shake his hand. Unfortunately we did not get the sales managers name, but he should not be working in sales with such terrible people skills.  My mom bought her car here a few years ago, and I expected a good experience but we were extremely disappointed. I don't recommend coming to this dealer if you know about cars and know how much you want to pay for your car. Get ready for disrespect and a terrible customer experience.<//review>< Time>

<review>Bought my new Acura MDX from Thomas Acura. Excellent experience all around. Since do not live in the LA area, I had to fly in to pick the vehicle up. Ian was very kind to pick me up from the airport. Fernando was extremely professional and treated me the way you would expect to be treated on an Acura dealership.  I strongly recommend you try out Fernando's special test drive route  if you are in the market for and AWD vehicle. Whether you buy a car from them is up to you, but you would do your self a disservice by not giving them a chance to win your business.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Updated review for service in November 2019...
Thomas Acura honors their work and went above and beyond to resolve the issue (see details below).  For what JC (tech rep) did for my trouble, I would definitely return for future maintenance and repairs.

What happened... I took the 2014 MDX in for the B12 service as well as the fuel injection cleaning.  After driving the vehicle for a day or two, all the warning lights came on like Xmas lights.  I called to see if they would take a look.  After checking, the throttle control sensor needed to be reset and reprogrammed after the fuel injection cleaning.  All was fine for another day or two.  So I called again.  This time, JC offered to hold a loaner vehicle for me before I even went to the dealer.  I got the loaner and left the MDX on Saturday.  By mid-day on Monday, I received a call that the vehicle was ready.  This time the problem was fully resolved!  True that the issue should not have happened at all.  But the reason I'm giving a good rating is because they did not hesitate to own up their issue and provided whatever they could to make my experience as painless as possible.

Previous review (approx. a year ago)...
Allen was very informative and honest. The visit was for a routine maintenance (A12) and two issues: vibration during braking and the metallic noise from the front wheels. After the inspection, he reported back with the findings - what services will be needed and when as well as ensuring me of the safety operations of the vehicle. As a customer, I truly appreciate the honest assessment.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I LOVE my Acura and service at Thomas Acura in Covina is TOP NOTCH - so glad I did not get the Lexus - that place in El Monte is a zoo!!

I can't wait to turn in my 2016 Acura RDX and get the 2019 model end of next year!!!<//review>

Yesterday I walked in to check out the TL that they had but it was too expensive and too many miles for a 2013.... I met Kevin who mentioned that since I didn't want to buy the car to leave a review of his service and he is very communicative and not pushy at all. I found a TL 2013 with less mileage for almost 5k dollars less. It wasn't certified but I couldn't afford it.<//review>

<Review>Just bought a 2013 RDX and my overall experience couldn't have been any better.  Both Fernando Galindo, his boss and Billy were extremely friendly and helpful.  Definitely recommend Thomas Acura to family, friends and will go back for future purchases.< /Review>< rate>

I went to 3 other Acura dealers in Cerritos, Torrance, and Glendale. None of them wanted to make any kind of deal on a new 2017 MDX except Thomas Acura. I got a great deal, they were very professional and business like. Key point, they did not waste my time at all on saving over $6,000. They also gave me absolutely the best price on my 2014 MDX trade-in. I very highly recommend Thomas Acura in Covina. The drive to Covina is well worth it in savings and the way you are treated by the sales staff.<//Text>

<review>This place is horrible! I came with my husband 3 weeks ago to have my car serviced, we were about to leave and my husband wanted to check out the nsx. While we were there, the door happened to be open so my husband sat in it. A Salesman Kevin came to me asking if we needed any kind of help which I thought it was great that at least they say hi, the problem was that his manager (Asian) gave this really nasty look at the salesman in front of us! All because my husband was inside the nsx. If we aren't worth checking the NSX according to the managers then why put it there? I feel sorry for the salesman that deal with these kind of crap managers, if I were a Thomas Acura employee I wouldn't tolerate that kind of treatment. Maybe this is why they don't sale as much because they treat their sales employees like crap. Where's the Mr.Thomas? Appreciate your employees! Get better managers.
I'm never coming back to get my car serviced here, we aren't worth checking your nsx Mr
Thomas !<//review></record>

<text>I brought in 2006 TL that had died while driving, electronics and engine shutoff and coasted to a stop.  However, after brief time it started right back up and ran like nothing happened.  Took it into my local auto repair shop that has handled all repairs to this point.  However, they could not get the problem to reoccur, and also could not figure out prior problems where battery dies if don't start car for more than 24 hours, and the Vehicle Stabilization Assist (VSA) trouble light was on.

So, I picked my car up and did some research on Acura dealers and after reading reviews decided to go a little farther to Thomas Acura.  They fixed the battery draw problem (disconnected HFU), and the VSA light right away.  However, they also couldn't get the car to shutoff while driving after testing for 3 days.  They didn't want to replace a part without knowing it was going to fix the problem (which I appreciated), but after I asked them possible causes from their previous experience with TLs, I decided to have them replace a portion of the Ignition switch that is the most probable reason for an intermittent electrical shutdown.

It was also time to replace the tires, and they carried the brand I wanted and installed them for very competitive price.  The total for all this work was very reasonable, and they fixed everything that I asked them, and didn't push to fix anything else.  They are honest, friendly, and do the work they promise for a fair price - highly recommended.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

I have had several experiences at Thomas Acura and they have all been terrific.  Recently, I worked with Fernando Galindo and he did an outstanding job for me.  I highly recommend working with Fernando and Zabi at Thomas Acura.  If you live anywhere other than Covina it is worth the drive.<//text>

I have had so many problems with this dealership it is pathetic. Acura is know for being aa good car and I have had decent experiences with them in the past, but the most recent experience was just awful. I hava had so many problems with the car itself. I've had to use a handful of rentals while they fixed the problems that came with the car- which were many. Beside this car I have used Ford and Toyota, and I have had better experiences with both of them. Aside from the many issues with the car itself I had terrible customer service. The employees were rude, unprofessional and useless. The service I received at the Covina dealership was as bad as the car itself. I am genuinly impressed that they were even given jobs. My personal experience with Acura has lowered my expectations so low the hole in the wall dealership next door would make me happier. Very dissapointing.<//Review>

< Review>
Bought my new 2013 RDX from Thomas Acura. I worked with JR the sales person and Zabi the sales manager. Both are friendly, funny and easy to work with.

After some internet search, i narrowed down the price range for how much i wanted to pay for this vehicle. I sent out price inquiries to a bunch of Acura dealers around town, and got a few quotes including Thomas Acura. Thomas wasn't the lowest offer, but they were able to beat it by another $100. Everything went so smooth with ZERO back-and-forth typical dealer haggle. JR and I exchanged a few emails and got everything agreed upon before i went to pick up the vehicle. When i arrived, JR greeted me with my brand new RDX. He spent a good 20 minutes going thru all the features with me, very thoroughly. Unlike many other sales I met who only cared about $$$ and sales, JR knows the product inside-out. The price was exactly what i was quoted, and he did not push to sell me anything i didn't need.

Zabi, the sales manager, took care of all my paperwork. He's efficient and funny. It took less than an hour to go thru all the documents, and his jokes made the whole process like cruising on a Hawaiian sunset boat.

Overall, the experience of buying my new RDX with Thomas Acura has been nothing but pleasant. I highly recommend JR Davidson and Razi. Do your homework, get prepared and work with Thomas Acura. Not only will you get your loved new car, but with ease and smile.<//Review>

{'time': 1616083636205, 'text': 'Dennis – thank you for the review on the auto-idle-stop feature that is on every new Acura manufactured for sale in the US today.  I hate the feature!\n\nWe checked your 2021 TLX for software updates and compared to other vehicles and we found no problem with his car compared to others.  It is functioning as designed.\n\nI have noticed that if you transition from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal ‘quickly’ – the initial acceleration can be a bit abrupt as the engine is receiving ‘more’ throttle than ‘normal’.  Again, I hate the auto-idle-stop feature, it is annoying.  Our 13yr old knows this about me and is in the habit of pressing what he calls ‘The Avenger Button’ when he rides in the front passenger seat to disable this.  It is super easy to disable this feature, which we told Dennis about, the button looks like this:\n\n-Ian Thomas, Owner, Thomas Acura'}<//Resp>

I'm always looking for good food in the places I work in. This burger place is top notch. Has that classic burger taste that is sometimes really hard to find for a price that seems almost a steal. I'll definitely be back!</Text>

If you are looking for a good burger, Ben's won't disappoint. They have a good variety on their menu, including onion rings, which are oddly hard to find these days.  Everyone should try the mushroom burger; the BLT is ah-mazing.

Overall, Ben's is a cute little family-owned place with great burgers and great service.<//Review>

<text>If I could rate this place 6/5 stars I would. I ordered the mushroom burger, and based on it alone I would rate 5 stars. I got a milkshake which was phenomenal, the fries were wonderful, and the service was top notch. Depending on where you sit you can see them cook the food if you want.<//text>< rate>

Can't go wrong with some Ben's. Everything was quick and delicious as usual. Our order usually consists of a family size fries (they don't salt them, you do), a Western Burger (onion rings, cheese, BBQ sauce, bacon), a Hawaiian Burger (pineapple, cheese, teriyaki sauce) and a couple grilled cheese sandwiches. They make their shakes with hand scooped ice cream, and have bananas and malt if you want to add them. We typically have a Rocky Road and a couple Cookies and Cream. I ventured out and had a Banana & Chocolate Malt 🤤... See you soon Ben's Burgers...< /text>

This place is not fast food, do not put it in that category.  My wife and I love this place and miss it dearly.   We live elsewhere now but still haven't found a burger joint that is quite like this one.  Ben has the best teriyaki burger on the planet.   The milkshakes and fries here are great compliments to the burgers.   I think Foster freezer has the best fries.  Not many of them around anymore.   Ben's fries aren't greasy and mirror Foster's the best.  Look no further you have found the perfect place.<//review>

<Text>Ben's burgers are ok. I wouldn't say anything good or bad. All I know is I left unsatisfied and still felt a little hungry. The place is nice and clean and the lady at the counter is friendly.  The 1/4lb special said $7.19 I think it was and when I paid it was $8.40. She said you want cheese however there is cheese on the picture so another gimmick to get you to pay more than expected and too late cuz you are there with coworkers and dont want too look that cheap.  Yeah so my conclusion.....I won't be going back. Sorry Ben< /Text><resp>None</resp><rating>3< /rating>< Name>

Went in yesterday & the food was great but while I was trying to figure out what to order from the menu, the cook/cashier straight looked me up & down & was obviously judging the heck out of me simply because I had on a crop top. Made me super uncomfortable!<//Review>

<response>None</response><Text>The food was ok, nothing special.  Onion rings were the standard breaded frozen  rings.  The burger meat was not frozen which was good for a place like this, but average quality, nothing special, plus they do not season the meat. A little salt and pepper or some home made seasoning would be a great improvement<//Text>< time>

Ben's burger has been a staple of living in Livermore. With exception to springtowners, the May Nissen park is a childhood memory for the current adults. More often than not this also includes getting a solid burger after a fun swim. Ben's burger is just great, a burger that's just good ol beef and deep fried fries and real ice cream shakes. Nothing fancy, nothing crazy, but the same quality every single time.< /Text>

I would give a zero star but I just ordered today a bens burger and I told him 3 times only Mayo lettuce and cheese and he put mustard. So I called him and complained and he told me to come in and do I did and he just remade my burger I told him the onion rings are cold now. He told me there's nothing wrong with them. Don't ever go to Ben's burger a great business will remake everything. Terrible STAY AWAY.< /Text>

Hello everyone,

I had Flower Gallery take care of the flowers for my wedding and I am more than happy about it.

They were nice and helpful with me. The delivery was perfectly on time. The flowers and bouquets were gorgeous. Here some pictures !

I definitely recommend !<//text>

Two "Beautiful"... "Spectacular" arrangements of flowers have been ordered and sent from Flower Gallery to my dear friend at home recovering from surgery. It's nice to find a company that truly cares and creates beautiful Arrangements. Grateful and thankful to your store and your staff...Continue the great work! Update July 2021, Just used your flower shop again to send more flowers to my friend to pick up her spirits and brighten her day. You never fail to deliver what is expected. Thank you so much!</Review>

<text>Could not have been a better experience. Beautiful flowers were received by my friend and they were so fresh and smelled nice. I very much recommend using the Flower gallery! I wish I could put a picture up, but I'm not seeing a place to do that. Very kind individuals that worked there also helped to make this an easy and special delivery.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Because this was a funeral for a my father, I spent almost $1,000 for the floral arrangements.  When I arrived at the funeral home, I was appalled Flower Gallery didn't deliver the correct size of arrangements as listed on the website. I feel like being ripped off.

This is the first time I used Flower Gallery so didn't know what to expect.  Their service was exceptional.  They got the order right and they got it delivered quickly, at the right price.  It really feels good to stumble onto a business conducted in such a professional way.   One other thing I almost forgot: I called another flower company first, and they didn't even answer the phone.  Flower Gallery picked up immediately, and they were easy to deal with.< /Review>

I ordered on-line, very easy, for a delivery the next day.  My only complaint would be that they delivered the same day!  A day early to a birthday surprise is better than a day late!

The flowers were beautiful and lasted well, which made for a very happy girl!<//Text>

<Review>I tried to order online but couldn't make up my mind since this flower was for a special occasion - business grand opening. I called the shop. The lady in the shop answered the phone. She is very friendly and answered all the questions I had in my mind. Thanks very much for solving my puzzle how to pick one. The tall beautiful flowers were delivered in a timely fashion and my friend loved it very much.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>I have ordered from S. Pasadena Flower Gallery several times in the past year for my daughter & fiance who live nearby. I am in Michigan. I don't like to order from the more generic 800# florists, service is less reliable and less personal.. SPFG has done a great job every time, good looking arrangements and with quick delivery when I need it on short notice. I will continue to use them!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I called on a Monday morning to place an order for same day delivery. Working in the floral industry myself, i knew what i wanted and what i did not want. I asked for a modern and pretty arrangement, using specific flowers. They exceeded my expectations and created a beautiful arrangement my friend was overjoyed with. I also ordered two balloons and when they noticed they had to sub one of the balloons i asked for, they called me to make sure i was okay with the substitution...very nice! The only minor thing that was not great was that one of the mylar balloons delivered was all ready deflated BUT i understand that happens, and for those of you who would knock a shop for delivering a deflated balloon....relax, it's not the end of the world, it happens. I'm sure if i called and told them to replace it or refund me the money for the mylar, they would have. But my friend wasn't bothered by it and neither was i. She was seriously so impressed with the arrangement. They delivered in a very timely manner to her work place and even sent me a picture of the arrangement before it went out to make sure i was happy with it. Nice customer service, very professional order taking, they translated my direction beautifully....and that's exactly what you want to look for in a florist. You have an idea, and they take that idea and create something beautiful. Thank you again!!! Very happy, i would recommend this florist to anyone in the area and i would use them again.< /Text>

<text>UNSAFE!  No masks in the clubhouse, groups of golfers drinking from pitchers of beer out front of the clubhouse.  The woman managing the desk in the pro shop told me "My body, my choice" when I asked about safety measures & masks.  Too bad, I had enjoyed playing the course.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Greens are in pretty good shape but fairways need a little work.
There is some bermuda grass that like to grab your club and prevent a full swing.
All and all its pretty nice course to play.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Absolute BEST supplier of quality Tattoo Supplies! I am a shop owner and use Beanies weekly.
And if you need anything Airbrushed, these guys got skills. Top quality work!
Graffiti Artists!! This is it! Get all ur gear at Beanies. From tips, drips, & exotic cans.
Its like an Art Supply shop for all the fun arts!<//Review>< username>

Poolside has been cleaning our pool for 5 years.  We have never had any issues with them. They are always willing to help and they also have a good pool equipment service department too. Charles and his family has put together a great team and I wouldn’t go anywhere else.</text>

<text>This store is wonderful, the staff are knowledgeable, friendly and their store is immaculate. We are inexperienced pool owners and have been searching for an upgraded pump everywhere! When they received the pump we needed they called to inform us two were in stock and held one until we could get there. Thank you Poolside, we will recommend you to all family and friends! Today, you gained a new loyal customer!< /text>< pics>

I own Stockdale Pools and have done a lot of business with Poolside Supply. They provide top notch service and supplies. The ownership and employees are highly knowledgeable when it comes to pools and will help with anything you need. Highly recommend their services even if you have a Leslies around the corner.< /Review>

<text>This place if the only one I know of in Bakersfield that has "real" liquid chlorine for my pool. (The ones in the yellow cases that only pool cleaning professionals use in the area). Their electronic pool water testing equipment is top of the line and gives you very accurate readings of your water condition.

Also, they installed a ScreenLogic2 for my pool & spa. The installation was seamless and I am very satisfied with the competitive price and service.

Since finding this place, PoolSide has been my "go to" place for all my pool needs as I am a do-it-yourself pool enthusiast and like to take care of my own pool. 5 stars!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

PROS:  The staff in the store are very friendly and helpful.  They are attentive and knowledgeable about the water test and products in the store.

CONS:  My pool needed to be pumped/drained, refilled, and chemically corrected because it was very green.  The water test was done and I decided to hire them to make a service call to my house to place the pump in my pool to drain it Friday evening.  I told them my son had a birthday party planned for the following Saturday and was assured by them it would be ready.  No one showed.  I called Saturday morning and was told an apology and that someone would be out within an hour. After no one showed for at least 6 hours I called again and was told someone would be out within 30minutes.  Someone finally showed up about an hour later.  The pump was placed and the water drained then refilled by myself.  I took in a water sample Sunday morning at which time I was told someone would be out that day to place the needed chemicals into my pool.  No one showed.  Monday morning I called and was told someone would be out sometime that day. When it was nearing closing time I called again because no one showed up.  Someone came out that evening and added the chemicals.  Tuesday evening there was no improvement in the water so I took in another water sample and picture of my pool.  Charles (Owner) then came out within 30 minutes to correct the situation.  He apologized for the hassle and noted that the float on the auto-fill was broken.  He said he would fix it.  Wednesday he came out again to continue treating the pool but no communication was made to me about what he had done to my pool or any further plan.  Thursday I went into the store with a picture and concern again because the pool was still green with no improvement.  I was told that Charles would be out again that afternoon and I requested he call me to talk about the plan.  He never showed up and never called me.  The float for the auto-fill was also never replaced as promised.  By this time I was tired of calling them and with the lack of improvement in my pool.  I gave up and went to a different pool store which had my pool improving within one day.  The pool was NOT ready in time for my sons birthday party.

Two weeks later I received an invoice from Poolside for the full price of their service a week after the printed due date. No attempt to contact me was ever made to make sure the pool had returned to a swimmable state and no discount for lack of prompt service or any of the other problems were ever offered.

DO NOT have these people come to your house...you're better off doing it yourself.</review>

<text>Skip PoolSide Pool Supply, I was getting water tested here weekly free of charge then they told my son we needed to pay for water test for now on because we are not customers. I called to ask them about this and I got the response that we don’t purchase anything and that they are going to charge us. Which isn’t true, we bought Chemicals, Net, Filter, Floater & some color changing liquid for the pool water.

Oh, well due to there greediness I will no longer spend my money at this place.<//text><username>David Kush<//username>< response>

They say there service is so called professional but they are scammers. I waited more than a week and the guy that the company sent out said that it should heat in a few hours, it still doesnt work. Then after he left i reviewed his work, he did very dangerous wiring and just taped it and left it. I also noticed that he did not run a ground wire. They are trying to charge me a ridiculous amount of money for doing nothing. Never go  with this company its a big joke< /Text>

<Review>Understandably Screen addicted customer service reps.lol.  We live in an age where we are constantly distracted by our screens to the point where we miss important details. Well, one of the reps was a perfect example of being distracted by their screen. I walked in by myself, trying to make eye contact will a service rep for about 10 minutes. All were busy, so that was understandable.  One occupied rep said he would be right with me. Then continued to help his customers.  Another rep finished, and I waited as she walked away to the corner of the store staring at her phone. After waiting for 3-4 minutes away from everyone else, I proceeded to walk toward her and ask for help. She apologetically told me that she thought I was with another group. What? Lol. I wasn't in a hurry, so no worries. I had an easy question that asked and answered within 2 minutes. However, I'm not impressed with what service has developed into these days.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1582648481005, 'text': "Thanks for taking the time to let us know about this experience, Eric.

<user_id>109803745014716820387< /user_id><Text>I've been with Verizon for a few years and recently decided to upgrade my phone. I got the phone I wanted but was lied into taking a supposedly free tablet along with it as part of a special promotion, I do not need a tablet but I made sure to ask that it was completely free so I had him add it on. I was told the first month would be 180 as the phone has an activation fee, when my back came around it was 264 because I got an activation for the tablet as well as a line access fee. I went in to talk to the employee and I was told the 100 should be refunded the following bill and the line fee would be dropped as well. next month no refund and another line access fee for the tablet, the employees were no help and told me to call customer service, later I found out that canceling my tablet line would be a 175  fee. seems like they lied to me to get me into a more expensive contract, fortunately customer service was able to waive the cancelation fee.< /Text>< response>

If I'm spending over $1000 dollars and am a long time customer on a business account, I would expect a better work ethic and support.

Thank you for the response. My customer service standards are relatively low. It's not my standards you should be worrying about. Having "high standards" for your employees comes first.

I wanted to upgrade my phone and my wife's as well as upgrade my parent's phones from dumb phones to smart phones.  I was immediately helped by Marty and he made it all happen quickly and painlessly.  This was hands down the best experience I have had at a phone store.  If you go, ask for Marty, he has fantastic customer service and the customer's best interest in mind.  Great experience</Review>

Was in & out in record time thanks to some great customer service.  I went in knowing what I wanted, was greeted at the door, and had my new phone in hand within minutes.  VZ rep Ashtane offered a few options which were appreciated despite my declining them.  Best experience in my 15+ yrs as a customer.</Review>

Told the sales person about the battery issues I have been having with my phone and that I wished to pay off this phone and get something newer. She goes into this big long diatribe about charging my phone overnight and how it wears down the battery and that I shouldn't do this. Pretty demeaning. I was not interested in getting a free replacement, I was going to buy a new phone, so why go on and on about the battery. To be honest I never had a battery issue with any of my other phones.< /review>< Date>

Horrible service. Rude employees but the manager was the icing on the cake. Will never go to this location again. .. was so many different issues that Customer Service for Verizon via 800 number took care of with additions because of the poor service. People need to treat all customers with the same respect. So beware if you are a pre-paid customer, your service will be pushed back with lack of respect on top of it.  Horrible< /Review>

<text>I signed up for data on my iPad. Sal assisted me and by then end of signing up he told me the plan would be thirty a month for what I wanted. I was satisfied and left only to find a month later that I was being charged forty a month plus a forty dollar start up fee. If I had been told this then I would have chosen a cheaper option. I spoke with another sales rep at a different location and she told me I would have to go back to where Sal works to fix the issue. This was thirty minutes out of my way but I figured it would be worth it given all the extra charges. When I got there Sal never even addressed me personally and his manager assisted me for half an hour only to tell me in the end that there was nothing she could do. Customer service is about setting expectations right and what they did was not professional at all. In the end I called customer service and they at least reimbursed me twenty dollars, but this was basically the cost in gas to drive there and back. Very unsatisfied and very frustrated that they didn't offer anything to correct what was at best a mistake and at worst dishonest.< /text>< GmapID>

DO NOT GO HERE!  I bought two phones BOGO in NOVEMEBER still not receiving the discount. Is is almost JUNE.... Also they took my old phones, I'm rather stuck with this horrible company.  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  Don't sign anything with these people, go ANYWHERE ELSE!  Oh and everyone I dealt with is gone and there's a new woman named Turquoise who basically was trying to prove I was lying and didn't want to work with me to get what the CONTRACT says I am owed by this horrendous company.< /text>

I camed in on OCT 22 2017 to add another line to my account and an african american rep helped me add the line but he couldn't activate the line for me. So I asked him to undone and removed the charge, he said he will, but turn out he did not.</text>

I have been to this Verizon store and they are JERKS!!. and nothing turns out right. Then I found out there's a Verizon  Down the road on Katella ave when los Aliaminos  starts. by the Costco parking lot. There next to Juba Juice. there nice and  very helpful... There are called GO Wireless Verizon.  Andrew, Steve, and Israel where the reps that have helped me and really know what there taking about.    Sp. when I bought my wireless card for the net.. they even spent like 10 extra min. setting it up. It was so cool!< /text>

DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE. Even if it around the corner from your house. I went there twice (should have learned my lesson after the first time).  The first time I had a battery question and the "tech support" guy had no idea how a battery works - instead of just saying "I don't know" he proceeded to spout off a bunch of nonsense that I verified as being incorrect with a few friends who are electrical engineers.

Then for some reason I thought I should go back again to purchase a new phone. A "newly hired" representative messed up my account so much with add-ons and extra fees that it took 2 weeks to repair the damage to my account.

Drive farther and go to a better store.<//Review>

<Text>STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE.  This place is such a liar!!!  When I open a new line at this store they told me they will give me free accessories but a month after when I received my phone bill they charged me with those accessories and I called the verizon help line 611 they pointed the finger to that sales rep saying that verizon is not responsible for what the sale rep said.  I'm regreted that I switch to verizon.  I should have stay with Tmobile</Text>< GmapID>

The WORST cell phone store that I have ever stepped into.  I would hate to have to work here. One of the Rep's placed us on a horrible plan (Ryan), went back to the store 4 weeks later, the manager Paul Figueroa could not assist us because he was so busy with only 5 people in the entire store and 7 employees there.  Manager Paul mentioned that we needed to come back when the Rep returned to figure out what we had been sold. He's the manager!!!  He should be able to do his job and look at what we were sold!  HORRIBLE customer service from a guy named (Turquiose), poor managerial skills from the manager and horrible manner in which to treat a customer of 15 years!  Canceled my service, will NEVER go back to Verizon and will tell all of my associates, all of my family and my friends that Verizon stinks and to Never use them!!!  Too bad Ratings don't have a Negative 5 Star, that's what I would give this place!!!<//text>

<name>Michelle Toguchi<//name><Review>Don't go into this store if customer service is even slightly important to you. The lady who greeted my husband and I was so unpleasant. She actually seemed very irritated that we walked into her store. She was equally unpleasant to 2 kids who walked in right after me. My husband said he usually avoids her when he goes to this store. I can't believe that Verizon has this woman working for them and is the first person customers deal with since she stands by the front door to sign in customers.  A couple of other employees wandered by when we were speaking to this woman, and obviously heard her say she couldn't help us, but they seemed scared of her so they didn't offer to help. I heard her send away the 2 kids also saying they have to go to the place where they originally bought their phones and that there wasn't anything  she could do to help them. I have been with Verizon for at least 10 years, but dealing with this woman is seriously making me think about changing my cell phone service.<//Review></record>

< review>
I truly appreciated the friendly knowledgeable customer service that was provided by both Chandler and Diana at Extra Space Storage. I needed a 10 by 20 unit fairly quickly and at a reasonable price; not only did they have one available, it was reasonably priced as well. I had everything done in under 30 minutes. I couldn't be happier. Thank you both for your time and hard work.<//review>

<text>Diana and staff are so helpful and delightful to deal with.   The only negatives are that I usually have to wait for a cart to transport items to or from the storage unit.   Corporate needs to listen to the needs of the customers.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>After our unit was *broken into* and many of our belongings stolen, they never followed up to ask when they could fix the roll up  door. When we called 5 months later to ask if they could move us within the facility and fix the door, we let them we had priced comparable units they were $130 less per month elsewhere. When we said we were leaving they finally offered us a unit that was $100 less a month. So we agreed to stay, then *after* we moved our things they gave us the runaround: We saw the charges were not correct the next day-so I called and they told me that I had to come back again to get the rate that they had promised me on the phone (and that they had told me in person the day before). I asked if me or my husband needed to come to the office to do the change after we moved everything, and they said he could do it. The next day, their story changed, but their excuse was 'we didn't discuss rates, and you said to transfer it' Ridiculous! Now I had go in person, AGAIN after he had already transferred it in person with a pandemic raging....because for some reason they had to rent the storage unit in my name instead of my husband's to transfer it at the lower rate. I think they just wanted to charge us more each month rather than give me the competitive rate.They wasted my time after my unit had been *robbed* on their facility. I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere for your storage needs! I would leave zero stars if I could.</Text>< pics>

EVERYTHING I stored here was STOLEN by OTHER RENTERS. I've used storage units for years and always had a great experience, until I moved here. A few months into my lease, several units were broken into, over $12k stolen from my unit, items that my deceased parents had given me and other valuables that I can never get back. One of the units near mine, the poor guy lost his whole apartment (he was away traveling). Horrific! The Bay Area has such high crime but why are the storage rents here so low? It's because the security is basically nonexistent and they don't care about break-ins. It's ACCEPTED here. Finding out the thieves were actually still renting at this location was what really shocked me, the management never even asked them to leave. They said it wasn't their problem. If you care about your stuff, go somewhere else, maybe a family-run storage place where mgmt actually has to care about their customers. After researching, the Bay Area has a track record of storage unit breakins and I wish people would stop trying to cover it up, change your SECURITY PROTOCOLS & charge $ accordingly, or don't offer the service at all.
The other reviews mentioning the price increases with no warning are 100% valid but that's not what concerns me here. As a woman, I NEVER FELT SAFE here. Sometimes the gate was open at night, didn't work. Homeless people and druggies renting here. I never felt safe to go into my unit alone and thankfully I moved out and will never be renting at any Extra Space again.< /text>

The process with move-in and the paperwork was smooth.

< Review>
Xenia's cool and all you know. She like, helped us out figuring out what I reserved online because I was like, confused and what not. But she totally rocked it. Like she showed us around and what doors to walk through just in case we got lost because Im tired and all, but she powered through it man. She like knows her schtick, is that even a word? Like she's cool too and upbeat attitude you know? OH DUDE, she even greeted me happy birthday in front of my wife. Like whoa, Xenia, i just met you and all you know? But I think she should like, own this building or be like CEO right? Give her a raise or something you know. Oh and even bigger plus, I have a friend named Xenia too dude. So unreal. But yeah man, thats my review. 10 out of 5 stars.< /Review>

Xenia was really helpful and very thorough and informative about the lease and the property. We had reserved a storage unit and within 5 mins received a phone call - came to this specific location a few mins later & got the unit we were looking for!
Would recommend anyone to take the time and come check this location out 5/5 would recommend!</text>

<Review>Love this location but the younger girl at the counter has been blatently rude to us on more than one occasion, there were also signs posted in the elevator asking people not to urinate in them. This is a great location for a great price if you only have to deal with the manager (who is very sweet, and extremely helpful) but if you ever have the misfortune of dealing with the younger clerk you will regret your choice in choosing extra space storage.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN-oq9_n2zSxb2roHHSZZl3eucrHpQ2N5HLTC7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fcc7a8c0e756b:0xb12d735ba20bac9f<//GmapID></record>

< Review>
I called to inquire about renting a space late afternoon Thursday, saw the space on Friday and was impressed by how friendly and knowledgeable both Diana and Allen were in answering all of my questions.  This is my first experience with renting a storage unit and I was unsure about the whole idea and process of doing this, but they quickly made me feel at ease and safe about moving some business/office stuff there temporarily.  I was impressed by how clean everything was...so clean I thought it was a new facility until they told me it had been there 10 years!  You can't even tell by looking at it.  The inside and outside are spotless and shows how much they care about their facility and their customers.  The use of the free truck to help with the move was an added bonus that I appreciated very much along with the first month discounted rent.  I highly recommend this location for your storage needs and for the excellent and friendly customer service provided by Diana and Allen.</Review>

I made this reservation late in the day and not realizing what time they closed called she asked if they would please wait for me to arrive I was on my way I wasn't aware of their hours and she was very gracious sure no problem and sure enough when I arrived right before closing time she took the time to clearly and very pleasantly explain everything to me she didn't rush me she was very friendly very helpful and I would go to this location again and again in the future for these types of services if I needed it< /text>

I have too much stuff, and I need somewhere safe to keep the overflow. Diana was kind and helpful, and got me set up yesterday; Rebecca was delightful, and helped me get my affordable unit today!

It already feels like an upgrade from the storage place I've been at in Oakland for a few years. The facility seems well-maintained, and the crew is super-nice :)< /Text>

This place is awesome! I've rented at at least 4 different places and by far this place is above and beyond the best. The customer service is paramount to the manager at this location. Her employee is as well polished. I would recommend this place 110%.  This team has gone out of their way to ensure  my safety  which I'm sure isn't in their job description but they are real,  down to earth and pasty close attention to the right things and i can't  come up with enough words or thank them enough. Any questions? Please contact me.  This place has my seal of approval and that alone, in my circle, means allot.  Thank you.</text>

Good security. Fair price. Easy access. Great lighting. Above and beyond customer service.

Edit
When you are walking in at first to rent...then the other staff come on.

Storage is a luxury service. These folks act like they are the most important part of the transaction.
Bathroom is often unusable. No emergency contact. Poor call center support. No 24hr access. Try else where.<//Review>

Staff is pleasant and accommodating. Hours are great and facility is clean, well lit and secure. Price was reasonable until they just jacked it up from $248 to $296! My biggest complaint is the lack of restroom facilities after-hours and whenever the staff is at lunch or away from the office working. There actually is a bathroom that is available, but the staff chooses not to open it because apparently the large homeless population in the area kept damaging and dirtying it. Therefore, rather than policing it better, just make the rest of the tenants suffer. Not very customer focused thinking.<//Text>

Thomas helped me at this location and was exceptionally helpful.  Always patient and polite and a great sense of humor.  I highly recommend him and the other workers at this location.

I hope employers understand that us consumers receive requests for reviews from just about everyone now a days and if I answered them all that is all I'd be doing.    Sometimes common sense is a better way to rate a business or employee than this relentless requests for pats on the back.  If I did not like the business I would not be using you.  Oh and thank you very much for the free truck for my move that really helped!<//text>

I was in a tight spot, the manufacturer had two pallets of our product that had to move,

and our shipper was booked for the month. I went in and spoke with Diana here in San Jose

and she set me up on the spot with a great storage space, clean, secure, and well lighted.

I believe Diana to be a terrific asset to company, and look forward to many more months

of business with her . Best Regards!</Text>

Thanks, To the great at Extra Space storage. I was having a crazy day trying to find storage for my mother in-law.

I give it a 5-stars because it's spotless, considering the surroundings. And it's almost always staffed with friendly managers roaming around the area, sweeping the surroundings, just being a great help (and always smiling). This comment is a 180-deg departure from another storage facility in Santa Maria (Central Coast) where I had the worst experience. So this is actually a stretch for me. <insert satisfied emoji here><//text>

He knows his biz, reps the brand well and is great to see each time you are there. Thanks Tom and Brian.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I went in to check on pricing for a unit a couple months ago, not intending to rent one just then as I was shopping around. I worked with a lovely young woman named Chance. I ended up not getting the unit- only because I ended up not needing the unit, but the customer service was so much better than I had anticipated it being. She was patient with my questions and had a very upbeat attitude even though I felt like I was nagging with the 20 questions game. The property is kept really clean and you can see that they do a lot of work to keep it top notch. If anyone was hesitant, there is no reason to be. This Extra Space Storage is a great facility, I can't see going anywhere else.< /Text>< rating>

< Review>
I have rented from this facility for eight years.
I let them know I am vacating, I had a twenty six dollar and one cent on next months balance well will not be there and I was informed NO REFUNDS!!!!!!!!
LOTS of money for rent I paid over eight years and NO REFUNDS!!!!!
Against the law so I called district manager Mike Sinclair told me do what I got to do..
and then hung up on me. Mr. Sinclair was very rude over twenty six dollars and a penny!!!
Mr Sinclair this is for you its against the law keeping my money I am not renting to from extra space WHY DO YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP MY MONEY?
Well Michael Finney I will call its wrong what you and corporate big wigs do to consumers as myself.
SHAME ON YOU!!!!<//Review>
