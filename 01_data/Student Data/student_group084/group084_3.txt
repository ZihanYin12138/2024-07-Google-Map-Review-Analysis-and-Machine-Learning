Very nice and relaxing place to start our wine tasting in Calistoga. T-Vine is a collection and preservation of old wineries from historic families who own vineyards. The setup for the wine tasting is great just beside some vineyards and the staff is nice and relaxing. Mostly known for their red wines, enjoy the experience.< /text>

<Review>Great wine from old vines!  We joined the club a couple of years ago and have never had a bottle of wine we didn't love!  We had a good visit last week and again enjoyed wonderful wine.  Keep on preserving!< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We found T-Vine 5 years ago via recommendation after visiting Frank Family and we asked the taster what their favorite winery was.  We were not disappointed. The wines were deeply flavorful and the staff was extremely accommodating even with our 2 small children.  Since then we've been ordering cases from time to time and have never been disappointed.  Occasionally they open up their library wines and I'm able to pick up some birth year wines for my kids.  Looking forward to sharing these wines with them and the stories of visiting Nappa when they were just ankle-biters!  I highly recommend these wines and can't wait to visit when normal times return!< /Review>

You just can't go wrong buying and enjoying T-Vine wine.  I have been a member of their wine club for a couple of years and have visited the winery longer than that.  I have collected most of their wines.  It's worth every penny!  Sharing this wine is so much fun, because everyone always loves it!<//review>

Affordable tasting, friendly staff, and absolutely delicious and thoughtful red wines. We especially enjoyed the Chardon, Petite Syrah, and Zinfandel. We will definitely be returning to T-Vine and will be recommending it to any friends visiting the Calistoga area!</text>

< Review>
I went to T-Vine for the first time in 2019 after visiting Tank Garage and absolutely loved the fact that the Zinfandels were so scrumptious. Visited again this year, in mid-October. Such a refreshing change of pace from all of the Cabernet that we see in Napa Valley. Amelia was a wonderful guide through all the wines and used original descriptors that I could easily relate to. Highly recommend!< /Review>

T-Vine is the creator of my favorite wine in the World... their Grenache!!
I always have a bottle on hand for any get togethers and the proof is in the pudding (or grapes in this case!) The T-Vine Winery is also the perfect place to sample their wines with a friendly staff and beautiful surroundings! Try them... become a believer!< /review>

<Text>So excited to stop in and taste 3 great wines.  Brendan was great from the moment he answered the phone to book our tasting reservation.  Due to COVID19 space was limited.
When we arrived Brendan was very welcoming and made us feel right at home. I would highly recommend a stop at T-Vine when on your next wine tasting trip. Oh...just know you will be tasting fabulous wines in a great setting.
See you again soon.< /Text>< pics>

Love T-Vine! Every time I visit the staff make it a fun and enjoyable experience. Each of my friends that I bring along with me, love the wines and the atmosphere!

Although not related to anything about the company - It would be great to have more snack options or a food truck available :-)</Review>

We love the wine at T-Vine! We were there for spring break in 2019, and loved it so much, we ordered wine to be shipped to our home. The team is amazing! Thank you to Alyssa, Tori and Brendan for fantastic customer service, a caring attitude and sharing their expertise about their wine with us! T-Vine should definitely be on your list of wineries to try when in the Napa area!<//text>

<Review>The Wine's at T Vine never disappoint. The staff is both courteous and knowledgeable. Took advantage of the amazing weather on Sunday and sat outside. Service was great despite being the only people outside, we never felt like we were waiting. Such to have a tasting option in Napa Valley not focused on Cabernet/Bordeaux Varietals, but still rich, juicy, delicious red wines.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate><GmapID>0x808443749fe88da7:0xdf7c4d65c6ebfff<//GmapID>< Response>

My fiancé and just completed our first weekend stay over in Calistoga and we loved it! We usually stay in or around the Napa area as we have family there, but we decided to give Calistoga a try. On Friday, after a grueling 7-mile hike, we biked from our hotel to T-Vine, our first tasting of the weekend. Boy, what a start! Brendan was our server and not only did he provide amazingly knowledgeable information about the wine, but he also provided a great deal of local information of places for us to check out. Now to the wine! I am a fan of big, juicy reds and there is no shortage of them here. We ended up walking away with 3 tasty bottles including the Mixed Whites bottle, which was a pleasing surprise. Each of the wines opened up in the few moments they sat in the glass and all went down with smooth complexity. We'll highly recommend this to anyone visiting the Calistoga area and particularly if they are lucky enough to have Brendan be your host.</Review>

The staff is so friendly, welcoming and also very knowledgable.  Every time we go to pick up our club shipment or for a tasting, its like visiting with old friends.  Some of our favorite wines right now are the Cherryhouse Zin (don't miss out on this), and the Grenache. Wines are very tasty, moderately priced and good value. We just did a tasting this past weekend; due to Covid, they have limited tasting outdoors which was wonderful, and we felt very safe.  Be sure to check them out next time you are in Calistoga, you won't regret it.<//Review>< pictures>

T-Vine was one of my best experiences ordering from a winery in the Napa Valley. The people are friendly, the wines are incredible, and the prices are very good for what you get. I like more offbeat grapes, so I really enjoy their Charbono and Trousseau Gris, but everything they offer is great. Definitely pay them a visit if you're around Calistoga!< /text>

My husband and I first became acquainted with all things T Vine back in 2014 during a short stint in Calistoga. A client we shared had recommended it to us so we bopped over one afternoon for a tasting. We left as members! Over the last 5 years I’ve been happy to send friends and family to T Vine to enjoy their amazing library of wine. From 100% Zin, cab savs, my personal favorite charbono to incredible blends T Vine really delivers amazing and complex wine! Our recent visit on 1/22/2020 was exceptional as well. Amelia took incredible care of us, her love of the wine and the work that goes into it was evident throughout our time with her. again we left T Vine as members and I had a few library vintages in my bag to boot! Thank you guys we can’t wait until our next trip out.</review>

Had an amazing experience at T-Vine in Napa Valley. I had two friends visiting, so we arranged a tasting and T-Vine provided cheese, crackers, and meats for the wines. Everything was absolutely delicious, especially the wines! We bought a few bottles and can't wait to open them. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, non-touristy, and really nice wines. Alex was an exceptional host.< /review>

This is a spot for 麻辣烫! I think that it’s a bit pricey for what it is, but the flavors were good. We also had the 口水鸡, which wasn’t cooked very traditionally (it was warm with a slightly different flavor profile than what I normally have).</review>

<Text>Its the best bowl of soup ive ever had, i come back often... It's a bit spicy so i add some lemon to it. Their customisable soups allow you to pick what you want in it making your soup that much better</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I could say it's far behind the 'best' as they said in the slogan. There are two different branches of authentic Chili Pot from China, the Szechuan one and Northeast one. But this chili pot doesn't taste like any of them. It's too plain. The soup is not tasty. It's not authentic at all. What's worse, the price is unreasonably expensive. I'm so disappointed. I ubered here round trip for $20 but I got this. Not recommended at all unless they remake their recipe.< /Review>

<user_id>118043466794625822474</user_id>< review>
I came during the last 30 min of opening (during their soft opening period), so some of the bumpiness was expected:

- They ran out of a lot of ingredients by that time
- They were still new to waiting tables (e.g. I pointed to a drink and they handed me the display bottle rather than one from the fridge)
- They left the "open" sign on after closing on accident

However, I was actually quite happy with the food. I got the dry chili pot at mild spiciness, and it hit the spot. I wish they had an English explanation for what a "dry pot" was somewhere, because I basically went in blind (but came out fairly happy)</review>

There is not a better place that keeps me working as dental hygienist. They are effective without feeling Ike your being beat up. Their massage therapist are well educated in body mechanics and human muscoskeletal anatomy.</Review>

I cannot talk highly enough of the therapists at Active Bodywork. I've been seeing Hunter but all the therapists are great at what they do! They can work out so much more tension in your muscles than you can do alone. I won't lie, it does hurt while during it, but it's a great hurt that is totally worth it since it releases the tension. I highly recommend!!!< /text>

<Text>If you're looking for a place that delivers the hurt in order to take away the pain you've found it.
I've been worked on by four different therapists here and they're all PHENOMENAL. As a dancer, my muscles and mobility are important to me and everyone that I've seen has been attentive, personable, and knowledgeable. Every session is focused on what I need done that day (whether its my knee, lower back, shoulder, etc). Todd was able to minimize a very specific pain in my knee in order for me to perform just two days later. If you want the same treatment (sports-related or otherwise), come here.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1525542561646, 'text': 'Thanks Janice'}<//resp>< gmapID>

Excellent massage, great space, good recommendations for follow up service, honest appraisal of underlying issues. Sandra is excellent at what she does. One of the best massages I have ever had, and certainly the best sports massage.< /Review>

It's a clean and well kept place that really knows how to take care of your needs. Natasha is great with working with you to figure out what you want to focus on and getting all those knots and everything else out of your system. And I'm sure the rest pig the staff is great also!<//text>

<review>Finally a therapist who listens to me.
Not just a massage but Natasha focused her attention the the issues with my legs and gluts.  I left with real relief for the first time in months and still two months later the relief has been constant.  Best sports massage in town.  Give yourself a treat and go find some relief.< /review><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809ada3ef252a749:0x9ab842ea919e38ba</gmapID><Rating>5</Rating>< Pictures>

This business is a massage service which provides a standard massage at a discount price.   The business is clean with a basic decor.  It's setup more like the environment of a dentist office.

Reply to Business : I did not book online.   I called in.  I don't remember the details.   I was contacted by @birdeye for feedback on my experience, check with them they must have the appointment information since they knew to survey me.<//text>

I let them know of your bad experience with their office.\n\nThank you for your feedback on Elite Spinal and Sports Care. We are completely separate business. Unfortunately We do not schedule for them or have any involvement with their employees. We do not have contact info or schedule information.\n\nWhen you book an appointment with Active Bodywork you get a confirmation phone call, text, and email. We also have front desk on the weekends.\n\nIf you have any questions please let me know. If you are in the area again please let me know and we can get you in for session'}<//Response>

This review is for sports massage services.

Based on recommendation from a friend, I booked a massage through Elite Spinal for an Active Bodywork sports massage at 9am on a Saturday with Brandon. Making the trek from SF to Sacramento takes a while, so I called several times leading up to the appointment to confirm, especially because they included the name of the wrong person in the confirmation emails.

Day of the appointment rolls around, and no one is here or answering phones/emails. I wait until 9:35, and finally an employee shows up who tells me she doesn’t have Brandon’s contact info because he’s on “the other side.” Wow, no employee directory? If you’re able to schedule appointments for the other side, why not have their contact info too? I know it wasn’t her responsibility, but she didn’t even try to welcome me in or help problem-solve.

Overall, this was a terrible experience with scheduling, very unprofessional and disorganized. I will not be making the drive up again!< /Review>

On behalf of the U.S. MARINE CORPS and The MEDICAL CORPSMEN

If you want to do real sports massage and specific ART massage then this is the only one place in whole Sacramento area.

I recommend Michelle who is one of the best  Therapist there.</text>

I've been going to Todd for years and recently have seen Brandon.  Completely impressed with both ART therapists. I've been competing in triathlon for 14 years and I've seen a lot of sports specific therapists. I highly recommend Active Bodywork!</Text>

I'm a 24yo male and live an extremely active lifestyle leading to a muscular injury in my back, shoulder, chest, and hip flexors after not recovering properly. They very easily identified the spot of trauma and began working on correcting the issue. Right from the start I could tell ABW employees are extremely knowledgeable and each action performed is deliberate and designed to trigger something (in a good way). Normal massage or recovery places simply jump right in and massage you, ABW takes the time to identify the problem areas and cater their movements to provide the best results. These guys are respectful, courteous, seasoned, and professionals. They helped advise me on ways to implement new recovery techniques to help keep me healthy. I will be returning to ABW for additional follow ups, and can say with 100% certainty that I'm on the road to recovery. Thank you ABW for all the help you provided me!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This place has taken a turn for the better after Covid with safety measures being enforced and cleanliness unlike before. The manager Jaz is taking care of all his people and definitely has a more attentive and caring team on the ground. Great work guys!</text>

As a former Assistant General Manager at this location some would say that I'm bias but nevertheless this location is the best gym in the bay area. The equipment is in supreme condition, the training staff which roams the floor are more than helpful with any questions one would have regarding technique, advice or proper usage of the equipment. The bathrooms are always clean. They have more than enough space (45000 square feet) to fulfill your workout even at peak hours (Monday -Thursday 5 - 9). The price per month is competitive and relatively a bargain considering most other gyms condition is sub par when thinking about cleanliness. Overall this is a great establishment to further ones health and fitness needs.<//Text>

what struck me in the first place is a very huge gym, a lot of simulators, a lot of possibilities for types of training, there is also a place where you can do boxing, do different exercises, there is a basketball hall where guys can play and train with teams
if there is a very large parking lot where you can park the car and in addition to parking it is also free, that is, there is enough space for everyone there is a pool there are trainer instructors who will help you of course not for free but in any case there are a lot of guys who can tell you there is free water
fitness is at a very high level because everything is thought out To the smallest detail If everything is necessary for you to do any exercises that you wantsimulators so much that it seems to me that there in my opinion of the workout can do up to 300 people immediately</Text>

Absolutely love this gym. I am 70 and people welcome all people here. Even disabled people. Not at all like a "HE MAN GYM" PLUS the classes and instructors are great. I wish they had bathing suit dryers in the ladies dressing room. Plus I wish they offered Ballroom dancing lessons for exercises. That would be lots of FUN.<//Review>

I got my guest pass to try it out and when went, I was told I had to signup with $120 initial fee  before I get to use my free guest pass. Two days later, they called and offered me to use the guest pass without commitment.   Customer service needs improvement.< /review><user_id>113591248578698536774< /user_id>< Name>

Terrible downside is the customer service. I had an extra $20 per month charged to my account for a guest pass (which I signed up for). However, when I wanted to eventually cancel it, it probably took about 5-6 for them to actually do it. Which to me means around $100 they took from me. When I went to cancel my membership because I was moving, it took so long to just get to talk to someone who knew what they were doing. Be prepared for "The manager isn't in right now. Come back another time." So all in all, if you don't care about good customer service, this gym is amazing!! If you do care, I would be hesitant in joining...<//text>< pictures>

I like this gym it's not pretentious or one of those fancy and over priced places. For a very reasonable price you get all the weights and equipment you need plus a pool and sauna. Normally it's not too crowded but there are definitely times the equipment I want is being used. They need to do a better job cleaning sometimes, the showers seema little dirty. But for the price you can't beat it< /review>

Pretty nice gym. They don't really have a good place to deadlift, but people do it anyway. No bumper plates (n5ice that are worth using anyway) and could use one more of the nicer squat racks. Great price and other amenities. Women's bathroom trash is always full.< /review>

<username>Lanxin Shen< /username><text>Just moved to Bay area couple weeks ago. In general, this gym is nice in terms of the facilities it provides. I also purchased the personal training and I regret it now !!!!!

The guy who sells me the training service told me how he is going to help me reach my goal balabala. After I paid, he didn't show up on the first two apportinments and just ignored me.  First time he said he car didn't start. I sent him multiple texts to reschedule the appointment, he didn't response me at all.  I catch him in another City Sport location after a week. He said he was sick for the entire week. I believed him, and schedule an appointment with him, and he didn't show up at all. Of course I texted him, no response again !!!</text><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Initially, I enjoyed coming to this gym. There are plenty of machines, and quite a few amenities at this location, including a three-lane pool and saunas. However, what I didn't notice until much later was how dirty and under-maintained the facility is.

Machines are consistently out of service. There is mold everywhere in the shower areas (at least on the men's side).

Overall I still think it's a decent gym, and don't see myself stopping my use of this facility. There's a lot to improve though.<//Text>< Pics>

This is a downgraded rating as this place continues to get worse. The maintenance/upkeep is just unacceptable. It may be a symptom of the location, no matter how bad it gets they'll always have business. Lately half the men's showers don't have curtains or they are ripped and you have to always test the soap dispenser before you go because there's a good chance it's not working even if it is full.

That's just the issue of the day, there are many others as well. It finally made me update today.

There are much better City Sports gyms in the area and I guarantee it's worth the drive.

I hope it gets better, as it's the closest one to me. If I see it I'll update.<//review>

<text>I am a member for two months now I signed up for training program (once a week, and I also train on my own 1-2 times a week)  and I’m extremely happy I’m seeing results! my body is changing and feeling stronger and not ashamed to look at myself in the mirror.
My trainer Sarah is wonderful ! she is knowledgeable, careful (I’m 48...) and yet always pushes my limits.
I feel like I’m making huge progress in short time and for affordable price.
Thank you!

true locker room is not the cleanest and there are some problems sometimes with Wi-Fi which (I’ve read that in other comments as well) - but overall I think they’re doing a good job, agin especially the training program is excellent!</text>< pictures>

Pretty nice to have access to basketball and pool. Small issues with overcrowding at peak times but that happens. The personal training program I think is not well designed but if it motivates you to workout that's your call.<//text>

<review>A very good gym. Wi-Fi now works much better (and Cellular coverage is blocked by the building walls.) Here in Silicon Valley, no Wi-Fi or bad Wi-Fi is unacceptable. There were plenty of Wi-Fi problems until this month, when they got it fixed.

In general, the STAFF is friendly and helpful, but there had been an attitude of "not my job, not my problem" due to upper management not being receptive to ANY sort of constructive criticism about some problems here. It is not the way other CSC locations behave nor should behave. Seems much better now.

Fully equipped with ample free-weights, tons of machines, lots of cardio equipment, ellipticals, treadmills, pool, sauna and spa. Just be sure to bring your own towels (no towel service here) and bring a plastic bag for your wet stuff!

Men’s lockers can be crowded at peak times. Generally clean but occasionally very messy. Regular staff are generally very friendly and efficient. Cleaning staff has lots of turnover, can be very surly, it seems to me, and cleaning can be atrocious when understaffed and the club is very busy. Trash always overflowing due to door FLAPS on trash cans, not a good design... Toilets and showers may be closed for cleaning during peak times... Then, there are PEAK times when they wet-mop the floor in the locker room. THIS is not good. Wet-mopping should be done off-peak, not during busy times... Then there is also the FREQUENT problem of STANDING DIRTY WATER in many locations in and around the Men's locker room and outside the toilets and passageways -- due to faulty floor construction -- water cannot drain into the floor drains just inches away. STANDING water is unhealthful!

Free passes are available to members online for your friends; limited to several days. I joined a few months ago and got a generous discount for paying in advance. A friendly but often very busy place that offers a lot for regular workouts, especially if you can come in during off-peak times.

Bottom line: this place seemed to be mis-managed and did not seem to care about members suggestions. That’s now much improved.<//review>< Pics>

There is a pool, sauna, racquet ball court, dedicated personal trainer training area, and a plethora of general use machines. The staff seem generally helpful and not too intrusive or overbearing and while there is the occasional annoying patron, the majority of people that frequent this gym seem to have at least a basic understanding of gym etiquette. Which cannot be said for a lot of large scale gym facilities. Overall a good gym experience. Would give 5 stars but there's only one basketball court.</Text>< Pictures>

Clean and corporate. There is no guess work.  Those they are aggressive on their sales tactics, especially the personal training. One call and a no is enough. They have a 2 hour sitter to watch your child for a few dollars extra a month. We'll worth it.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>The Sales team here is the worst. I’ve tried to get some basic membership information from them on multiple occasions and it’s impossible. They tell you they have charts and sheets and claim it’s impossible to give their fee schedule over the phone.

I’ve told the guy I’d been there before and don’t need a tour, just shoot it straight. Just wanted to see what it’s going to cost for a basic membership — he couldn’t do it. Went on like a robot listing amenities.

If the pricing is so complicated and can only be discussed in person, it’s probably got some hidden fees and other ish you don’t want to be a part of.

Edit: They have a bait and switch tactic online. Advertising initiation and monthly fees, but failing to disclose the annual fee. Only when you click does it show in the itemized feed at the very bottom. Pretty shady.<//review>< pics>

My experience in this city sport was awful. I cannot believe a sales yelled at me and stop every sentence I was going to say.
My first time there was greeted by a new saleswomen and her attitude was not positive. She gave me and my friend a long PowerPoint to go through and our Zumba class was very close. She kept asking which plan we wanted to purchase. My friend said she wanted to take one or two classes first and try out the guest pass before making a decision. The saleswomen directly asked ‘’ Is that too expensive for you?’’, in a very offensive manner. Then I repeated asking whether I could go to the class first since it almost started, and then came back later for the membership plan. The sales women interrupted me rudely. I just stranded up and wanted to leave and then another salesman came and yelled at me. He said to skip the process I need to pay 50 dollars, as guest pass.
The facilities look old too, with a very small swimming pool. Not recommended at all.<//review>

Pretty awesome gym for the price, which gets you in all City Sports locations in the bay. Same cost as 24-hr but substantially larger/better facilities. Includes squash rooms, pool, basketball court, steam room, you name it. Large locker rooms/showers too that are generally kept pretty clean. The weight selection is good - every machine and barbell setup you can think of in great condition making it easy to do my resistance workouts. Unlike past gyms I've been in, a huge amount of dumbbells (that include 2.5lb increments!) and a huge amount of barbell weights that are kept close to all barbells. I never find myself having to hunt around for weights, to the point where I regularly see staff come around to re-rack or reorganize weights. And there's actually a ton of 2.5lb barbell weights around too - I hated having to hunt for those at other gyms.

The downsides are pretty minor, but enough to knock off a star for me. The smoothie station is often closed/abandoned - apparently they lease this space out to another company, who just show up whenever they feel like it. Pretty disappointing as this was one of the selling points during my trial week (sometimes I'm in a rush and need a quick+cheap bite on the way out). Except for one or two days month, since then I've never seen anyone working there and all the shelves are empty.

Some of the showers in the mens restroom need some TLC - they aren't bad but many soap dispensers don't work at all and/or are frequently watered down.

The "music" they play can be grating at times. This is true for any gym... but what makes it worse here are they play pre-canned jokes for some reason that repeat several times through your workout. It's obnoxious, and can make working out with a partner annoying.

Other than that, awesome gym. It's slightly more expensive than my last rock-bottom price gym but the location is awesome and I get a LOT more out of it.</Review>

Clean gym.  Has a pool for lap swimming that isn't as crowded as most places.  The equipment is in good repair and in adequate amounts for the amount of users. The staff aren't overly involved and will leave you to get your workout done but have been helpful when I have asked questions.</text>

<Review>A good sized gym with lots of free weights, machines and more. They have fitness classes, a basketball court, racketball courts and a lap pool.

Other reviews have mentioned the cleanliness. While I haven't been to a lot of other gyms, I'd say that for the price of entry, the quality of the place is well above expectations.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>Come here relatively often. It's a clean gym with lots of machines and weights to choose from. You have to be careful though because it gets packed here quickly. I shoot for the off hours, otherwise you'll be stuck for hours.

Edit: I lowered my review because I've noticed that the maintenance of the locker room and showers has been or lately. I'm noticing broken facilities as well as patches of dark mold in all the shower stalls.</Text>< user>

The cancellation process is the real workout, I feel like I get off a few lbs doing it. Their online service is soooo bad they need you to come into the gym to use the local system.
Some part-time staffs are friendly; but the managers and customers service works by the book, strictly by the book; they are so inflexible.< /text>

< review>
So I never heard of this place until today because every search I made for a gym one of their paid adds came up. I decided to drop by. It's a rebranded LA fitness. I walked up to the front desk and one of the employees was helping a customer. Another employee walked up to the desk in uniform and checked in while I was standing right next to him. I thought it was kinda rude that the guy working there doesnt say anything to a customer that is clearly waiting but I figured he was checking in and he will address me when he is done. This dude just walks away. Doesnt say anything. Really rude. Then the guy who was helping somebody when I walked up finished helping that customer. I expected him to shift his focus to me as I have been standing there for a solid 10 minutes waiting. He ignores me and starts walking around the front desk looking at notes that have been there for weeks. At this point I hollered over to him and asked if I should just go talk to the membership guys who have been ignoring me as well. He acts startled as if he just woke up. Dude seemed stoned to me. At this point I dont think there was anything that the membership guy could have said or done to make me get a membership there. I left without even using my free pass. What are they paying these employees for. I think they could easily be replaced by a check in kiosk. Worst customer service experience ever. Also, drug test that kid at the front desk.< /review>

Solid workout equipment and serious members.  lacks the amenities of a 5 star gym such as  superb hygiene and indoor track.  none the less, a pool, sauna, and steam room are descent and make the club attractive :)

<Review>I’ve been to a lot of gyms, from small, family-owned, fitness Evolution, 24 Hour and private athletic training facilities and this is the best facility for what you pay. It is always clean and the staff is very professional. If a machine is broken, it’s repaired in 1-2 days. Management is awesome and show they value every customer; not just the personal training customers. They have a swimming pool, a dance room for classes, a cycling room, 4 lane pool, 2 open floors for cardio and weights, saunas, dedicated stretching areas with foam rollers and racquet ball courts. I’ve been from any time from 9am to 9pm and haven’t had a bad experience with the crowd; everyone seems to be there to workout and not socialize. This is an awesome gym.<//Review>< Rate>

Really good gym for the price all that you get is worth the price. It is a bit dirty in the locker room and shower but that just means no need to hag out there. No pun indented!< /review>

I like this gym. I usually go in the mornings between 8:30-10:00 and the paper towel dispensers/ liquid to clean the machines are out when the gym has only been open for a few hours.
The customer service sucks and if you need any documents such as copy of contract or whatever you can only get it in person (which makes things inconvenient especially if your at work trying to file your gym reimbursement forms), then a manager has to approve it which in the few times I've need things there was a manager wasn't around. So I had to wait. Even if your in a contract with another person and you have all the billing info, name, email they still won't email it to the email on file due to their privacy clause, I'm not sure exactly what illegal stuff I could do with someone's gym contract especially if I already am married to the person. Anyways overall this gym is a good one.<//text>

<text>Burglary: Locker got broken into at City Sports, total lost $5000+

I have been working out at city sports for more than a year, then I got my locker broken into in October, 2018.

It was a Monday night, I got to the gym (next to San Jose Airport) at 7pm. As usual, I put my purse and gym bag in the locker and locked it. But when I came back from working out, around 8:40, I found the lock was gone, and everything got stolen except for some clothes.

I had reported to the gym first and told them I need to see the footage to find the theft. But they said they didn't have one! Even on the hallway or the front door. A few minutes later, I got the messages from the bank, the thefts were using my credit cards shopping in nearby stores, Target, Rite Aids, Home Depot, Walmart and Office Depot...They spent totally $4000 before I have the chance to call to cancel the cards.

Then I reported this burglary to SJPD and got a case number. I lost my purse, a new gold and black Chanel Gabrielle (serial number 26732573, worth $4400), drivers license, AirPods, home key and car key, about $100 cash, a Swiss Army knife, 4 credit cards. The police came to pick up the footage of which they’re using my cards at the stores later.

The terms and conditions or the liabilities surely protect the gym from being taken responsibility to any lost and stolen, and “no camera” just make it easier. While my concerns are, why there’s no camera to protect the members, and theft and burglary happened many times there, how can they never report this to the members? Anyone who can access their incident reports will be surprised what had happened at the gym!

They said they don’t have cameras due to privacy issues, however if people are not safe and aren’t able to protect their property, how can they reach a higher need? I can’t reach the base level of Maslow’s needs theory, cuz after this had happened, I had to change all the locks and didn’t even want to stay in my home and drive my car, for they have stolen everything from me.

So far, the PD hasn’t updated anything yet, the thefts may keep doing bad things or even worse, but the good people won’t get protected here. I had to move out of my home cuz I don't feel safe, cancel the membership cuz I don't want to work out with people who stole my things, and it’s really annoying when canceling the membership and getting my next-month fee back from the sales manager, who is arrogant and doesn’t care anything after you spend your money.

My tips are don’t bring your purse, bring a giant lock, don’t bring your car key, if they can’t steal your purse, they can take your car since even got caught, they just need to be in jail for a month and they won’t. They are able to use others credit card at stores which have hundreds of cameras, and why? Again, they’re not scared of getting caught and they won't.<//text>< pics>

<text>I've signed up for this gym 3 times. When they first opened up, they were great. The second time was horrible. The third time was better since I avoided meeting with a salesperson altogether.

The first time, the service was good and the facility was clean. I had to cancel my service because I ended up relocating and there was no issue.

The second time, I came back to San Jose and tried to deactivate my membership but they wouldn't honor my previous monthly rate. I went for the free trial that you can sign up on their website. They required me to take a facility tour again which I didn't mind since it was quick last time. The sales person I spoke with was either new or clueless. My girlfriend and I told the sales woman we were interested in taking the Zumba class that day. We arrived about 15 minutes before the class started just in case there was any paper work we needed to fill out. The tour ended up taking 45 minutes! The woman kept on asking us personal questions that felt irrelevant to either our fitness goal or for signing up. We ended up missing the class. After that, I decided not to join. I kept on getting calls from her to sign up for the gym. She called me at least 3-5 times a day for about 2 weeks.

The third time, I ended up just signing up online because there was a promotion that would honor my old rate. The process was quick. I didn't have to talk to anyone trying to upsell me on anything.

I recommend just signing up online since it'll save you the hassle of interacting with the sales staff.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>I love the place. Friendly staff, Clean, lots of equipment, no crowds for the machines, no naked females walking around the changing room and putting their nasty butts on the bench, just love it. Only thing is almost if not all of the speakers on the cardio machines don't work but I guess that's my hint to focus on losing weight and not on the tv.

If anyone knows of a good trainer here please let me know.< /review>< resp>

<Text>Pretty good gym IMO. For a public space that gets hundreds of visitors a day it's pretty clean. I do wish they had round plates instead of the ones they currently have. After a hard workout I like to cool off with a cold shower but they are either hot or less hot, no cold water, atleast in my experience which is a bummer. Place can get a bit packed during peak hours which is to be expected, which is why I come ~5:30am; even then there's a pretty good croud, which I'm cool with because the only ppl who show up that early are those that are dedicated and willing to get things done.<//Text></record>

<Text>They have lots of machines, most of which work. They have an indoor lap pool and even lessons for kids on Saturdays. The showers and steam room generally work. The jacuzzi has been broken every time I go there, which is a bummer. I wish that towels were available for a fee. I remember to bring mine or I don't get wet. Other folks opt to dry themselves with paper towels, which can make for a wet bathroom.</Text>< Pictures>

Great trainers and generally equipment is always available.  Only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is because the club's corporate policies are terrible especially for existing members.  Cancellation, modifications are a pain and expensive.< /Text>

<Review>Gym has some good people working there - clientele is respectful as well.  My biggest challenge with it is that is often subpar when it comes to cleanliness.  Paper towels and water bottles can be found around machines, left there for hours.  The sinks and toilets are awful... And the Lockerroom is pretty gross too. If you want to get a good workout, it's close and local... But that's about it.  If they are reading this - which I hope they are - I would use the supplements bar - but if you clean the blenders and food machines as well as you clean the facilities... That supplements bar is a bigger gamble than Vegas.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

started my journey here when they barely opened and I'm glad I did. awesome staff that are willing to give advice free of charge. weights are usually put back more so than other gyms. most cardio machines have tvs with apple integration. free classes along with other things like a full basketball court, cycling room, punching bags, lap pool, hot tub and sauna. the best thing of all is that there's usually no wait for machines or weights!</Review>

We took advantage of the "buy 2 years and get the third year free" and was utterly disappointed. The sales rep said that ALL of our family members (not relatives) will be able to access the facility with this account. However, in the end only one person was able to bring 2 other people into the gym. And we were not allowed a refund due to its "one-time payment policy". We could do nothing against them since there is no "hard evidence"; however this deception is unforgivable.</review>

<review>Convenient location w/ plenty of parking compared to the Brokaw one. BUT!
-Women’s restroom is always a disaster. Tp everywhere no matter what time of day. Floors are wet too cuz of ppl flopping around after the pool.
-Never seen staff cleaning. At my old gym, there would always be at least one staff vacuuming, wiping down equipment, etc. Not here. Apparently they have janitorial staff do it but I’ve only ever seen 1 person once out of all the times I’ve been a member.
-Paper towels and soap don’t get refilled if it runs it, esp if it’s later in the evening.
-It’s currently November- so temp is chilly outside but it’s stanks AF in here! The smell of body odor and sweat is strong all throughout the gym as if they can’t turn on the air higher or something?! I’m not being prissy, just hygienic man. It still pretty hot in here in the summer too so if you like to work out in cool, Aires out gyms this ain’t it
-Otherwise, lockers are cool. There’s mini key locks near the entrance & ones on the 2ns floor near the hoops.
-Wipe before and after you use the equipment to avoid ringworms cuz no one else does.

(Translated by Google) Excellent gym, has a large swimming pool, tennis and basketball space, a jacuzzi with a wonderful whirlpool, a sauna, a huge variety of weight training and aerobics equipment and lessons for all tastes. In addition a super spacious bathroom with toilet, shower to shower and even liquid soap for your comfort. There is also a fitness snack bar with juices and shakes. On the menu it describes that it has açaí and salads, bowls with yogurt, oatmeal, wraps and rice bowl, but they are not available at the moment, they will make it available again, as it is very good for people who exercise in the gym before and after work, they have the opportunity to make their meals healthy in the gym. Highly recommend !!!

Academia excelente, tem uma piscina grande para natação, espaço para jogar tênis e basket, Uma jacuzzi com hidromassagem maravilhosa, sauna, uma variedade enorme de aparelhos para musculação e aeróbicos e aulas coletivas para todos os gostos. Além disso um banheiro super espaçoso, com toilette, chuveiro para tomar banho e até sabonete líquido para o seu conforto. Também tem uma lanchonete fitness com sucos e shakes. No cardápio descreve que tem açaí e saladas, bowls com iogurte, oatmeal, wraps e rice bowl, mas não estão disponibilizando no momento, tomara que voltem a disponibilizar, pois é muito bom para as pessoas que fazem exercícios físicos na academia antes e depois do trabalho, têm a oportunidade de fazerem suas refeições saudáveis na academia mesmo.    Recomendo!!!

<username>Debra Shepherd< /username>< Review>
I appreciate that the Big Blue Bus has made a real effort to keep passengers safe during the pandemic. It has also been helpful to have the fare waved for almost a year. The routes have been adjusted to continue to provide good service to the public, which is admirable. My only concern is people who refuse to wear a face covering. I'm hoping that with the fare renewal will dissuade people who refuse to wear a face covering to seek alternate means of transportation.</Review>

In the entire county of Los Angeles The Big Blue Bus is the best, why? Well it's clean all the time efficient more than all other bus lines better drivers but could still do a lot more in that department of hire. Love them still.< /Text>

<text>So rude lady driver on the 7 bus . maybe over 50th year old. Needs sleeps enough . depressive and inpatient. If we don't ride bus, you don't get the job. We are customer. You guys ask for good service when you pay . so do the same.</text>< response>

<name>Mark Williams</name><Date>1579307246501</Date><rate>1</rate><Review>I'd like to give this place a great review. They run late most of the time like all bus services, but the buses are relatively clean and rarely overly crowded.

But four times now in as many weeks I've witnessed drivers missing stops, three times personally impacting me and another time failing to pick up someone waiting.

When you rely on public transportation on a bus that only runs every 30 minutes it throws your entire trip to or from work when your forced to deal with a 30 minute delay in your trip - every single additional bus or train route has to be adjusted.

It is embarrassing, and shameful to the city of Santa Monica and the obviously unqualified bus drivers that they cannot even drive a simple route once a day without royally screwing up this job. Clearly your driver's are overpaid for the quality of work they are consistently unable to deliver.

Edit: all the bus stops here are full of smokers. So if you don't enjoy second hand smoke, don't use these buses.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

BBB drivers can either be super friendly and helpful or just the worst.< /Review>

<Text>It can be a 15 minutes wait for the 1 bus even at rush hour. That's not good enough.

I'm all for supporting public transit, but buses will never become popular if they are slow, unreliable, and infrequent.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2a4d04ae281b3:0x4607cea7ee61d259< /gmapID><Time>1581485914711< /Time></record>

R7 all the time late. Online schedule is different from reality. As a result, you are waiting for long time and never know if that bus will come...</text>

<username>Magdalena Evans<//username><date>1464557122750</date><rate>1< /rate><review>I'm incredibly disappointed in this service. I ride BBB on a regular basis, and usually the service isn't too bad besides always being late. However, today I was yelled at by a driver for no reason. The driver of Bus 15 was on a stop reading, when I politely approach her and asked if this bus went to San Vicente to which she answered by yelling at me. She yells at me that she is reading and to no talk to her and a bunch of other things.  I apologized because I didn't want to get yelled at or even worse get punch or something. The driver seemed to have problems controlling her anger. She refused to answer my question.  It really  upsets me because drivers like her give the service a terrible name. I just got off the bus and wished her a nice day. She yelled at me even more for saying that. She said she was having a nice day until I came along. I've never been treated like this in my life.<//review>< Pictures>

Service is great usually on time except in rush hour with traffic. Clean and convenient. They have a great new system to see how far away and when the next bus is. Its called NextBus.< /text>

Very good bus! Cleaner than most buses, and drivers are friendly, patient, and helpful. I lost my wallet once on #1, the phone operator lady help me locate the bus and when it will return to my stop, and I got my wallet back in an hour.< /review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>It is unfortunate that public transportation in big cities such as Santa Monica and Los Angeles continue to provide service disproportionate with its customers.  Big cities are inhabited by a lot of people, yet these bus companies still, as we approach 2016, refuse to offer adequate service to accommodate riders.  They've earned their bad reputation well.  They need to improve their service by providing more buses, more frequently.

During rush hour it usually appears to be at peak service, buses are more frequent.  Other times, including some rush hour, i'v waited 30 minutes for the Rapid 7.  Many times i'v ridden the Rapid 7 and its been so jam packed its like being in a can of sardines.  Third world countries have better public transportation service!</Text>< pics>

On the other hand three #8 busses drive by - and they are all empty.

Why cannot Santa Monica schedule their most important busses in a way that doesn't generate these delays - especiallyu now they have increased the fare by a huge 25%<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Very RUDE drivers! Also very unsafe and go through red lights a lot. They let some people ride for free and others they force them off the bus. I will NEVER use this company. Hopefully another company can buy them out!< /text>

(Translated by Google) We took the big blue bus from LA airport to Santa Monica Pier to take advantage of our long city connection. Very simple and fast! Just take the airport transfer signaling greenline and get off at the bus and subway terminal. There are beacon places on the Big Blue Bus. From there to the pier took about 40min. On the way back we use the same means of transportation that has stops marked by the city. Super recommend it!

Pegamos o big blue bus para ir do aeroporto de LA até o píer de Santa Monica para aproveitar nossa longa conexão na cidade. Muito simples e rápido! Basta pegar o transfer do aeroporto sinalizando greenline e descer no terminal de ônibus e metrô. Lá possui sinalizador os lugares do Big Blue Bus. De lá até o píer demorou em torno de 40min. Na volta utilizamos o mesmo meio de transporte que possui paradas sinalizadas pela cidade. Super recomendo!</text>

<text>Styles, and Smiles is excellent when it comes to getting a haircut. The staff is extremely friendly. Christina is the most consistent stylist I have ever been to. We highly recommend this place, for his, and hers styling needs.</text>< Date>

<rating>1</rating><review>Literally went in for a simple service. All I asked for was color and THE OWNER added color without even checking if it was the right shade. kept COMPLAINING of how SHE messed up and that it looked ugly. Worst of all, she added lightener (bleach) without telling me about it, knowing my hair was pretty damaged. I watched as my hair burned off when she was blow drying it and she still lied about it.
Also, their work is overpriced. Don't waste your time or money.

I should've sued.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

10/10 for my first time experience! Michelle was my hairstylist and it was obvious they are passionate about doing hair. Since I have curly hair and wanted to switch up my look, it was very reassuring whenever Michelle would guide me through every process they'd be doing on my hair. SO happy with it right now and I'll definitely be going back to her when I'm due for my next haircut (plus the best price for what I got)!</text>

I went in for a hair cut. I noticed the menu said 32 for a haircut and style. The hair cut and shampoo was cheaper.

Anyway, i went in for a haircut and asked for no style. Just a cut and shampoo.

I was given a stylist who I don't know since I am a walk in. I told her I wanted just a half an inch cut off. She kinda laughed and said something along the lines of "just half an inch?". After she pointed out my hair being damaged I agreed on an inch.

I have never seen anyone cut my hair the way she did.  She had my hair behind my back and bent down to trim my hair.

Every stylist I've had before brought the hair up with their comb layer by layer to cut.

It's as if she literally just straightened my hair with her fingers behind my back, trimmed the ends, and finished. All in under 5 minutes.

I was charged 32 dollars for a 10 dollar hair cut. And i felt insulted by the way she laughed at me for not wanting to cut off more hair.

I would rather pay more money for someone who won't insult me for the hair cut I want and who will spend more time on my hair. Either that or go to a place that charges me fairly for the service they give.< /Review>

I never know what I want and give my full trust to Lulu, the owner, to surprise me with something new. I'm not all glam, so she usually gives me simple highlights. I also only come every 3-4 months so she makes sure to give me colors that won't show my roots too much.<//Review>

I had excellent service: cut, balayage, color, eyebrow wax. Very knowledgeable. My hair looks amazing and expensive. I will definitely return and continue going, I plan on getting microblading there soon.</Text>

Lulu does an excellent job! The woman at the counter though, that is another stylist was extremely rude to not only me but another client that had asked her a question.</Review>

I love coming here!!!!! Love my hair! My coworker who by the way has beautiful  hair recommended I visit michelle. My first visit I got the ombre and I loved it she did a great job, stayed very cautious of the bleach in my hair and was very friendly. Everything was done in a timely fashion and she even asked if I wanted curls or straight (unlike other places that just blow dry and style straight). I now live in San Diego and came back recently to visit family. Unfortunately michelle was on pregnancy leave and LULU the owner took me in for michelle. I went for a change and got highlights and a layered cut. I have extremely long hair and about 5 inches were damaged already. She cut only what I asked and played it safe with my layers since I explained I wasnt too comfortable cutting my hair because it was soo long. It went by so quick, they offered coffee and a magazine. She was done within 3 hours and I just LOVE LOVE LOVE MY HAIR!!! Like they say you get what you pay for. I would highly recommend these two lovely ladies and the rest of the staff I have not been to but they are very friendly.</review>

Styles, and Smiles is excellent when it comes to getting a haircut. The staff is extremely friendly. Christina is the most consistent stylist I have ever been to. We highly recommend this place, for his, and hers styling needs.<//text>

<review>Literally went in for a simple service. All I asked for was color and THE OWNER added color without even checking if it was the right shade. kept COMPLAINING of how SHE messed up and that it looked ugly. Worst of all, she added lightener (bleach) without telling me about it, knowing my hair was pretty damaged. I watched as my hair burned off when she was blow drying it and she still lied about it.
Also, their work is overpriced. Don't waste your time or money.

I should've sued.</review><rating>1<//rating>< user_name>

Michelle was my hairstylist and it was obvious they are passionate about doing hair. Since I have curly hair and wanted to switch up my look, it was very reassuring whenever Michelle would guide me through every process they'd be doing on my hair.

< Review>
I went in for a hair cut. I noticed the menu said 32 for a haircut and style. The hair cut and shampoo was cheaper.

Anyway, i went in for a haircut and asked for no style. Just a cut and shampoo.

I was given a stylist who I don't know since I am a walk in. I told her I wanted just a half an inch cut off. She kinda laughed and said something along the lines of "just half an inch?". After she pointed out my hair being damaged I agreed on an inch.

I have never seen anyone cut my hair the way she did.  She had my hair behind my back and bent down to trim my hair.

Every stylist I've had before brought the hair up with their comb layer by layer to cut.

It's as if she literally just straightened my hair with her fingers behind my back, trimmed the ends, and finished. All in under 5 minutes.

I was charged 32 dollars for a 10 dollar hair cut. And i felt insulted by the way she laughed at me for not wanting to cut off more hair.

I would rather pay more money for someone who won't insult me for the hair cut I want and who will spend more time on my hair. Either that or go to a place that charges me fairly for the service they give.</Review>

<Review>I never know what I want and give my full trust to Lulu, the owner, to surprise me with something new. I'm not all glam, so she usually gives me simple highlights. I also only come every 3-4 months so she makes sure to give me colors that won't show my roots too much.</Review>< Pictures>

Went to Monroe lounge for the first time.
Since I was looking for a hookah spot that was opened. So I decided to give this place a try.
The workers and owners made me felt uncomfortable. Not too many option of flavors to smoke. WiFi connection was poor that took me nearly 10 minutes to get me to connected to the internet. I will not return again.< /text>

Didn't even feel like sitting here. Asked them if we could be seated first and then decide the order, to which I was told "if you want to sit you can go to the car and come back". Brilliant.

RESPONSE: appreciate your concern of following covid guidelines, but that wasn't even the point.  COVID guidelines are NOT the reason for the server smirking while asking us to head back to the car if we needed a few minutes to decide the order. something to work on and not blame COVID for it..<//review>

A great place to hang out with friends with one of the smoothest hookahs in the bay! Definitely recommend Monroe Hookah Lounge.<//Text>

They don’t know how to serve the hookah. I’ve got not lighted one, so there was no any smoke and you should lighten it by yourself. Definitely not recommend!<//Review>

Nice seating and atmosphere. Music was on point. The charcoal on the hookahs could be better. They need to get the coconut shell charcoals rather than the run of the mill ordinary ones.<//review>

<Text>I been at this hookah lounge many many times with friends and is been a great place. But today Sunday was terrible!!! This is an adult lounge and the lady who was in charge she was playing cartoons movie instead of music. I can’t believe it! We came here to have a good time not to watch kids cartoons.! I complain twice and she literally ignored me.  This place totally lost my business!<//Text><GmapID>0x808fcb21d007b983:0xadcf8c1f8dbcb918<//GmapID>< time>

Worst service I received. The hookah wasn’t good after 15 minutes. I asked the guy to change it and he said I have to pay for refill because I been there for an Hour. I wasn’t there even for 15 minutes. Really disappointed. Not going there anymore and NOT recommending this place at all< /Review>

<Review>Love this place and their little dog too! There's never enough time in this cozy little shop around the corner. The staff really seals it. They use glass pipes so you don't have to work about the ceramic burring out the shisha too fast either. ❤️✌️<//Review>< Pics>

The person running the front counter was a great person to be running your store. He had a great attitude and was even trying to encourage the staff members in the back because it was busy. I appreciate employees and customer service people like this gentleman. You will definitely be a reason we come back to this location.</text>

Been going here for years and never had a problem until recently. They have the worst customer service of all the mountain Mike's stores. Was told our pizza would be 45 minutes tonight and showed up exactly 45 minutes. We were told to wait outside and ended up waiting a whole extra hour for our pizza. Saw people with numbers after mine coming and going. Nobody informed us of how much longer it would be they just kept saying coming right out. Then when we finally got our pizza, we got no apology for the wait what so ever. Won't be going back.< /Text>

Extremely busy but the staff are doing their best to make everyone happy. The phones are constantly ringing and lines to the door. I give them credit for trying to keep their customers satisfied even when the customers are rude and are full of egotism. I will keep coming here.<//Review>

<text>The pizza has the potential of being one of the best pizzas In the area, but they get something wrong every single order. Even when put a reminder in the comments to help them to not forget something (that I paid for), they typically forget it. The customizations on the pizzas (no mushrooms or replace with garlic sauce) is constantly missed. When I do say something to them, I typically will get excuses of why they can’t do their job instead of them just apologizing and fixing the problem.  They have lost my respect (especially the one on Floyd) and now they have lost my business.< /text>< GmapID>

Terrible customer service. Don’t know what they are doing. Wait almost 2 hour extra for 2 medium pizzas. Don’t deserve 1 single star.</text>

Best pizza in the valley.  Any Location. Hands down. Toppings fall off the pizza, because there are so much! Their garlic white sauce has no rival! The best! I recommend the Pike's Peak (red and white sauce), the Snowy Alps and the Robber's Roost! Just awesome! The locations we go to are clean, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.<//review>

Today 6-2-2019.    No air conditioning
No. Ice available
One person ordered a pizza with no cheese it came with cheese so they had to wait for it to be remade.   Pizza was ok   but the setting without air or Ice was not. Temp outside was 100o
And management had their door open with a chair holding it for ventilation   beware if your going better to take your pizza home</Review>

This place is awesome. The others who have had bad experiences are most likely bad customers. It's the kind of people who go in thinking they are entitled to things. If you know they ask for printed coupons then bring printed coupons. You get treated with the same respect you give. This place makes great pizza with great service. Yes there are a lot of younger kids in there but I guarantee there is always an adult of staff.  it's a great first job for any kids great environment. I heavily recommend the buffet as well as the pineapple chicken luau pizza !</text>

<Review>Modestoians (is that what you're called?) don't slaughter me, I know so many of you love it but I don't like it - at all. I've had Mountain Mikes a couple of times now. It's like a deep dish from Pizza Hut where it's more crust than anything which takes away from the flavor of the toppings. We have such AWESOME pizza places (that aren't huge chains) in Florida (I know right, not Chicago or New York!?) that I would love to support Mountain Mike's....but no. Each bite I taste crust and the flavor of the sauce and cheese doesn't seem to cross my palate. Y'all come on out and try Mellow Mushroom or V's Pizza!</Review>< Pictures>

I WENT TO THIS MOUNTAIN MIKES BECAUSE IT HAD SUCH GOOD REVIEWS ON HERE. Was the absolute worst salad was all wilted and it was a delivery.The gal said 1 hour 45 min and i thought she meant with in one hour to 45 min. No thats how long it was before we got the order my veggie pizza had very few vegetables on it and no tomato slices the other pizza and garlic bread were cold and tasted like it had sat out for awhile before they brought it. It was almost 50.00 and for someone who works paycheck to paycheck a very disappointing way to splurge.</review>

The wait times are ridiculous. And they've lost my pizza/my order several times.

The pizza is usually good, though, as long as you're prepared to wait 1 - 2 hours.< /text>

<date>1490496082690<//date><Rating>1</Rating><text>Myself, my wife, and our four kids had the worst experience and still going through it as I write this with this restaurant.
I got a medium Pepperoni, a large specialty, and a large chicken club pizza from there.
After we ate, we start feeling discomfort. My wife felt it first, she couldn't even finish the second slice.

Two hours goes by or so, my oldest boy start throwing up, and then my youngest boy. And then my youngest girl wasn't feeling good. So we took the pizza back and the manger kept telling us everything is good and clean on their end.

Now we got home and my youngest girl start throwing up, and that night between my boy and my girl they kept throwing up periodically, through all that my wife was feeling really sick with sharp pain in her belly, and I had hard time at work because I had similar symptoms, but not as bad as my wife.
So, we ending taking the kids to the doctor, and sure enough, it was a FOOD POISONING they had.

Bottom line, I'm never buying food from that Mountin Mike's (Floyd & Roselle location) , and I don't recommend it to anyone, we had the worst experience with that, and like I said, as I write this, we are still not feeling good. That place is dirty.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Upon returning I gave her my coupon and told her that this was the 1st time it has ever happened and that I have been a customer for a long time.

This would be my preferred to-go place whenever I needed an oil change for my car. Prices are reasonable and the staff is always ready to help. They also truly live up to their name, they do not seek to charge me more than what I need. I don't go here as often anymore as I moved out to another city, but if I could I'd continue to get services from them. Would recommend!<//text>

Tucked behind the Arco Gas Station but within the same premises, Honest Auto Corp. truly lives up to its name. Efficient, professional, friendly, affordable and honest. I come here for all my Auto work and I've never been dissappointed. Comes highly recommended.< /text>

<Review>I’ve been going to this place to service my cars since 2015, I take all 4 of my cars for oil changes and other services if needed! They are truly honest and the main mechanic is great. Always gets the job done and if they can’t they refer me to someone who can!< /Review><response>None<//response><Name>Delilah Adams<//Name>< user_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Took my car month ago for a bearing replacement 3 days after my car got a death shake when pressing my brakes firmly. Noticed a screw holding the disk was missinh causing it to warp. Took the car the following weekend they said it's a warped disc but that the missing screw was not the cause but the other side has both screws and it's perfectly fine. They denied repalcing it so ill never go back there again<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c32a57229d0ce5:0x7fd37c8efbc95f0f<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Honest Auto Group really lives up to its name. I was quoted $363 by Toyota Riverside to fix my window Seal that falls off by itself. Alex and Joseph from Honest Auto group fixed it for lot cheaper - not even $100.

Moreover, while i was there at the shop, an older gentleman came and said one of his signal light cover needs a replacement. Alex looked up the model that fits his car and told him to order from Amazon for $19.95 vs for Alex to order the part for $40 from the 3rd party. He then said to the gentleman that once you have the light cover, bring it to me and i will put it on for free for you.

They do care about customers. I am glad I have found them. Thank you Honest Auto Group!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Accidentally found this place. My wife's car needed some maintenance, oil change, AC repair, and brakes. And I needed an oil change and transmission fluid flushing. All these costed me less than one transmission fluid flush from the dealership. Plus they knew exactly what was wrong with my wif's AC unit without having us explaining. They are very knowledgeable and like their name said, honest. They have earned my trust and will continue to visit for my current and future vehicles.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c32a57229d0ce5:0x7fd37c8efbc95f0f< /gmapID></record>

Good food and great service. For the price point the food could be better. The Cajun seasoning is not so Cajun, had way too much celery salt that it was overpowering. The crabs were over cooked and the fresh crawfish was definitely not fresh. Other than that it was actually pretty good.< /text>

<text>If you look like your broke, or young, dont come here. Because first thing the waitress told me was, "we dont accept refends." I was pretty offended. They never refilled my girl friends drink till almost after we finished all our food, she literally had to drink my arnold palmer because they would pass by and act blind. Then when the girl handed me my bill, she stood there and waited for me to pay, standing above me at the table, super uncomfortable. Like where's your register? I aint going anywhere, i dont steal, are you profiling me because im hispanic??? Thanks for treating me like a peasant infront of my girl.< /text></record>

It's extremely expensive for the small quantity they give. Seasoning was overwhelming when it came to the pepper, and to top it off they didn't fully cook the food right. For spending $100 eating for one I expected to be happy or at least satisfied. I am a foodie and I know how to prepare and cook seafood, so my knowledge and experience as well love for seafood is serious. For my recommendation on this specific establishment...I will not be indulging on anytime soon. Thank You.<//Text>

Only because the place was packed and the staff was decent but I didn't order because I'm not a fan of shrimp with the vein still in them or the heads attached< /Review>

The crawfish were nice and meaty. The cajun seasoning didn't taste like any crawfish I ever had growing up in Louisiana, but this is San Diego, so they get a pass.< /review>

I came here a few weeks ago with a healthy craving for some boiled seafood. I left here feeling completely satisfied with my meal. The flavor was perfect. We went with the house special sauce and had it low spice, which was amazing. I highly reccomend eating here if you're ever in the mood for some amazing seafood. This is way better than Louisiana, I've been working out there for 12 years.< /Review>

<Time>1526958123541<//Time><Resp>None< /Resp><review>The Pub Season was to DIE for, however, the medium was pretty spicy, but couldn't stop eating it. The limes made it that more irresistible. We got their 3 choices of 1lb each of Shrimp which were SUPER sweet, previously frozen crawfish which was great and the mussles which we had to fish out the bottom of the bag. The corn, sausages and potatoes were delicious also. I will be back plenty of times it was more than plenty for 2 people to share. I will stick to the 1/2 medium of spiciness tho, as the medium had my nose running and bubble guts the next day from the spiciness, but SO worth it!</review>< GmapID>

First Time ordering from Here and
It was not good at all .... I got the 3 flavors all together and it tasted like seasoning salt and black pepper. Also I wanted the head and shell off my shrimp but they don’t do that shrimp was not clean properly  ... the mussels was not clean either.   I wish San Diego  had a kickin crab .....Because I just waisted 100</Text>

<Text>Great server, but the food was EXTREMELY overpriced. You eat out of a plastic bag and no plates. You have to dump it out on the table. Me and my husband were super disappointed. We wont return.

The crab and lobster were pretty good. Crawfish and clams not so much. We had a very long wait time for a table bc of covid and it was cold out. Which we were seated outside for that same reason. From people from true cajun territory, it was ok. Servers were very nice and funny. Music was definitely NOT family friendly.</Review>

Omg the crab legs were cooked just right though at first the price wasn't exactly what I thought I'd pay for 12 legs but the before smell and the after taste left me ordering another round from home
Before smell: Before I cracked one open
After taste: half hour after I finished my 1st order originally ordered and brought at restaurant.< /text>

I LOVE THIS PLACE! I enjoyed it waaaaaay more than Crab Hut! The $99 meal is $67 here and a lot more stuff included...my daughter had combo 3...king crab and shrimp...she was in seafood Heaven. I had combo 4 and ate every last morsel of seafood in the sack! Definitely going back here soon!<//Text>

Good food! A little pricy but the combo 1 with extra potatoes and sausage was 55 and fed 3 people. :)<//Text>

Food was good. We got the pub sauce and the waiter suggested we added lime to the salt and pepper mix,  then we poured the pub sauce in it. It made it taste sooo much better.<//review>

First time here, excellent customer service, my husband & I called in our order, so when we arrived it was already waiting for us, great really fast. The food was ok but we prefer the boiling crab, this is our honest review.</text>

Pretty great meal at an affordable cost. Two of us shared the three pound combo with an extra side of potatoes and got stuffed. Good service and clean place.  It came out to about 30 bucks each.</Text>

I have gone to Crab hut and crab shack in northern San Diego. They were decent but far drive. This place is local and really good. It doesn't beat BIG N JUICY in Vegas at all lol But Crab Pub is great for SD seafood. I had the 1lb shrimp with corn on the cob and potatoes. I chose the combo seasoning with butter, Cajun and garlic with Medium spice level. It was really good but next time I will go a spice level down to avoid my noise running lol 😂 but it was worth it< /Text>

Great atmosphere. To me it seemed small but I didn't look at the whole place. I went to place an order for pick up. Staff were professional even though it was busy with customers and orders but they were still polite.

The food?! AMAZING! Although I'm being biased. I only had crab legs. But they were so tasty. I wanted to go back and get more. The seasoning was amazing. Not too little. Not overpowering. Cooked to slide right out the shell. I will be back! Thanks CrabPub. 🦀</review>

I haven't been to too many of these Cajun seafood joints. The last one I went to was 10 years ago at the Crab Hut on Convoy, so I was excited to try this place my girlfriend suggested. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of this messy style, but the flavor was good.< /text>

<Text>First time trying this place out. Crabs were good but needed to be clean more. Still had dirt in a few legs. The crawfish were nice in size but they need to purge them longer and more. They were still dirty and dirty.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I love this place. They have a great sauce that goes on their seafood boils. Their sausage to add to your boils is really good. The service is always good and so is their music (if you're into hip hop and r&b lol). Nothing to complain about here!</review>< username>

Food was great, but the service could have been better. The male server was really good but the female I had wasn't very attentive. I Will definitely go back! If you like traditional crab legs me don't get any of the sauce they offer it is extremely messy. I really liked the spicy sauce. However, I prefer more traditional crab legs where you dip it in hot butter and the mess is minimal. All around a great place to eat!< /Text>

<Text>I purchased the unique #2: 1 pound of snow crab, 1 extra pound of shrimp with level 1\/2 tool! Came with 2 corns, 2 potatoes as well as 4 sausages. I suggest purchasing an added side of sauce (to dip in) and a side of fit to be tied white rice (for the sauce) This meal is huge it's adequate to split with someone for 38.99!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This place never has anything on the menu. Disappointment the last 2 times I went in.. the last time I was there the girl at the counter told me: we are waiting on a delivery we DONT have king crab,  snow crab,  shrimp,  crawfish, mussels, or sausages.. so basically NO seafood. Why not just CLOSE until the shipment comes? Walked out and drove to crab town almost 20 min away and got everything.</Text>

I’ve been coming to your place since it open I’ve never had a problem until today my crab legs were overcooked and the waiter kept telling me that it was the way we open it. My sister and I had to show waiter that it wasn’t the we where opening them they were overcooked but crab pub would never except that it was badly cooked I asked for a refund they said they where only given me 50% off even when I cracked 2 legs just to show them unfortunately they lost a long time customer</review>

<Name>Goli Nazarizadeh<//Name><text>If you want a fake Boiling Crab, this is your spot. The same crab and font in the logo, just rearranged. There are so many similarities, the lack of imagination is sad. Things are done the same or attempt and fail. The only plus of this copycat is that there is never a wait. The seafood seasoning lacks flavor. Sides dishes are good. Service is good. They're really nice and try hard to take care of you. Not an epic fail, but not great either.<//text>< pics>

Ok so according to the hubby he rates this place a 3\u00a01\/2 celebrities. We felt we didn't get full 1\/2 extra pound of shrimp. we ordered the combo number 5, the menu reviewed 1\/2 pound crawfish 1\/2 clam 1\/2 muscles, 1king crab as well as 1 snow crab. I'll tell you the order did seem underestimated i imply it had 9 items of shrimp. It didn't resemble they measured it precisely. Calamari basket had much more french fries after that calamari I was a little bit overwhelmed for sec we thought we got fries but Solution nevertheless was fantastic, everyone was so alert.< /text>

Didn’t like the sweet potatoes and the manager told me they were ok. Paid extra two dollars for sweet potatoes and didn’t get a refund.Shrimp was good but I will never return. He also didn’t want to tell me when his superior would be in. I see why it’s so empty.< /Review>

"Don some plastic gloves and prepare for a dining experience only a seafood lover will enjoy.  Crab pub, a southern style inspired meal much like boiling crab in Mira Mesa."

"Great atmosphere, customer service with a smile, meal executed well and fast."
-  Try "the pub style" seasoning with any seafood boil combination, brings out the flavor in shrimp and crawfish.

"Great seating for small groups or groups with 10-12 people.  Parking arrangement is convenient for almost any vehicle."<//review>

In the college area - always fresh seafood and without the wait. We've always been able to sit, order drinks, and food. Shrimp is always fresh and generous in size. Gloves, bibs and plenty of napkins are available. The check comes with wet naps and mints.< /Text>

<date>1540451406901</date><text>Server had really poor service skills. This is a place where you order by the pound.. typically great for sharing. However, the waitress made a point of attempting to divide the table from from food down to the gloves/bibs when it was out of her place to do so. I literally had to remind her she should serve everyone equally at the table. Quite discriminatory behavior unfortunately. Poor service will never equate to good food no matter how the food tastes.</text><UserId.>107161281869886749583< /UserId.>< username>

We found this place this past weekend.  The crab was excellent, the sauces were interesting and the waitress was great. The only thing not perfect were the utensils  for cracking the crab.  We were only given 1 cracker for breaking the crab shells between us and the splitter was plastic and not very useful at all.  Who likes waiting their turn to use the crab shell pliers  ? Who wants to let their crab get cold? lol not me!!! I think they should supply each person with  their own and upgrade their plastic splitter or give you a pair of scissors as some crab places do.  Other wise the place was great !<//Text>

Enjoyed ordering from the starter menu. Got 3 different orders, wings, calemari, sweet potato fries and shrimp for the same price of ordering the bag of food, plus 2 glasses of wine in the price. Great way to try a lot of what they offer. Cozy atmosphere.<//review>

This was some good old fashioned crab boil.  We ordered clams and crawfish, and we were in heaven.  Plan on a messy meal, ripping fish with bibs and gloves, and piles of shells.<//review>

If you have any taste buds left I would not recommend this place. If I could give it a zero I was expecting some seasoning  but what I got was anything but that the carrots had more flavor than my chicken or shrimp. Save your money and time  better off going elsewhere..< /Text>

< Review>
Worst service ever, they just lost a loyal customer. I called to place an order. I always order the same thing every time I go there. Got home and realized they gave me the wrong thing, I called back and instead of apologizing and give me what I actually ordered the cashier started arguing with me and calling me a liar. Never again will buy food from there. They were beyond rude and not helpful at all.</Review>

<Date>1487649266765</Date><rating>1<//rating><Review>The last reviewer were right about bland. However, it is the Cajun sauce that has flavor.  The food doesn't have flavor without the right sauce. I had eaten here before with better results. My friend said that I should have ordered extra sauce at $3 to enhance the flavor. We didn't like ours. We are on a low carb diet and had limited choices of restaurants while in SD. We complained about the blandness and the server tried to help but no refunds. Next time, I will pack protein for the road</Review>< Pics>

This was recommended to me. So I had to try it out. I got the crawfish bucket the one that was the house flavor (I forgot the name ) which was sooooo good. I love when a good seasoned crawfish bucket has some fresh garlic not that powdered BS. Staff was great, cold beers and clean bathrooms.</review>

Food was as expected from one of these places and service was average-ish. Main complaint was they weren't very friendly and then I guess my 20% tip wasn't enough because I was looking at a credit card statement and got charged $50 over what was expected. Avoid the hassle of getting ripped off and dealing with the credit card company and go to Crab Hut, Crab Town, Boiling Crab, etc</Text>
