<text>Oh my goodness my drinks were fantastic I had a berry lime sublime. That's my favorite. It was super clean inside, I went in about an hour before closing. My service was fantastic. She made a drink that was just a picture on the menu. It was some sort of electric Berry drink it was so good as you can see it looks exactly like the one on the sign. My local Jamba juice closed so this was a great treat.<//text><user_id>102785842600151317889<//user_id>< Name>

<review>Went into this location with my coworker. This was our first time there. The young girl behind the counter was very rude and had horrible customer service. She rolled her eyes as if we were taking up her time because we hadn’t made a decision on what we wanted after a couple of minutes. It was not busy and we were the only customers in there at that time.  We saw they were offering a free boost shot, and she was very annoyed that we asked if we can get that because it wasn’t offered to us. She seemed irritated that we asked what sizes they offer as well. We will not be coming back to this location. Very rude and felt rushed. The customer service was horrible!<//review>< userid>

<Text>The " new guy" was very rude to my sisters and I. Only 1 of 3 of us have ever been here and I dont think we will come back especially to this location. He rolled his eyes multiple  times when we asked if he had any other juice other then apple strawberry.... then he took the order from the guy behind us and he was super nice to him and even told him "I got you man" when he didnt know which drink his wife wanted....< /Text>< resp>

<text>I recently had my jaw fractured and have to be on a liquid diet for 6 weeks. A friend of mine got me a gift card to Jamba Juice and I was really excited. I never used to really go there so I wanted to try a bunch of different smoothies. I have gone there several times with a smoothie in mind and they have said they were “out” of ingredients or they “didn’t have” what was on the menu. Kinda frustrating.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

We walked in and at first there was nobody up front and we had to haul her to get someone to come up. But once she did she was very helpful in figuring out what we were looking for since we didn't know what it was called. I took a little while for it to come out but it was delicious once it was all done my pregnant wife approves!</Text>

<review>Very rude staff!! Ordered drink and sandwich. Drink was left on counter, no notice that it was ready. After 15 min. Asked where sandwich was and they rudely said one order ahead of mine...waited. asked again...one order ahead. So I just said I'm leaving. Asked if I wanted money back..but by now furious. Said no keep it, their response is...oh wow, in a rude voice. No apology!!< /review>< Time>

I love this place 5 stars easily if only they hadn't changed the staff, now the service dropped it takes about 20 minutes for my order when I'm the only customer there, I don't even know how long when there's a couple more customers there.
I really hope you guys fix this, after all you're my favorite after gym snack</text>

With all due respect auto zone has made DIY with automobiles experience actually harder to accomplish and always make sure that when you buy brake pads there always open up the box and  confirm that there actually what you are buying because especially if you your paying extra for the gold ones.because i bought the gold brake pads  and when i went to change them i discoverd that my brakes were still good and not necessary to change still havent even opend the box with the new ones...to make a long story short i took back the brakes to get my refund and the guy at auto zone opend the box and said that the brakes were used and they were as u could tell they were  used so basicly auto zone sold me used old brakes for the price of new top of the line ones then wouldn't refund me because they were used and would not believe my word against thers</text>

<text>Consider hiring employees that will assist female customers and treat them equally. I walked in today I needed help and the associate that seemed available to assist me considering  the fact that he was just standing around and not doing anything refused to assist me. I also needed assistance with adding the transmission fluid into my car and I couldn't find anyone to assist me with that as well because everyone refused to do so. I had to facetime my father to get the necessary assistance because the associates at the store were no help AT ALL. I dislike coming here because Everytime I do I get little to no help and all the employees are rude and extremely unhelpful. I will no longer be coming here I'd rather take my service to the O Riley's down the street because it seems like they know how to treat and better assist their FEMALE customers.</text><userid>100891282710969933523<//userid>< pictures>

Just because I am a girl DOES NOT give you the right to be rude and belittle me. I went to get info on battery cables with the info that was provided by my brother. As I called my brother to clarify the info you asked for, you rudely dismissed me to help the customer behind me while I was of you! Then you had the nerve to tell me my brother wasn't a smart one to send me! Your customer service was horrible!< /Review>< pics>

Good Vibes, decent variety if options for food. They offer some veggie dishes as well. They have even constructed a tent with heaters to allow you to sit outside and stay warm.< /Text>

This one has been on my list to check out.  LTH expanded their open seating, tented space outside. They thought of it all. Heaters, large screen tv's, spaced out high top tables. Huge variety of speciality craft cocktails, all pretty and yum. Had the Old Timer and the Skinny Girlfriend. So refreshing, not sweet. Ok the food is just amazing. Try the short rib fries, mexican corn empanadas. Everything tastes as it's looks, dreamy!! This is the Brunch Spot to be at. You must experience the chill vibe on the weekends, brunch, champagne flowing and the beach breeze.  They have inside seating, cool bar. Jasmine was our amazing server & rest of staff is just as friendly & welcoming✨ LTH is a gem! 🙌< /review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>I came in on a busy night. Was greeted at the door by a friendly and welcoming host! Sat at the bar which had plenty of TV's, the bartender was quick to take my order. Ordered an Irish mule and the green posole muscles. The Irish mule was very tasteful and rich! The food was delicious, they serve it with some toasted cut baguette (I think) and it accompanies the plate quite well! The bartender was very attentive and was super friendly when I asked about the plate since it was my first time. I would highly recommend the friendly atmosphere! Parking on the main drag could be dangerous so please be careful when getting out of your vehicle. Definitely coming back again!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great menu, delicious food, large portions. The outdoor seating is comfortable and appropriately socially distanced. The staff are very friendly. Looking forward to coming back often.< /review>

Great restaurant, service and food are terrific.
If you haven't been there...Go!
You might have to wait a couple minutes to get seated. Wait it doesn't take long and the wait is worth it.</Review>

<text>Small shop with knowledgeable, friendly staff. Pretty much had what I was looking for, except one ingredient, in which they had a yeast, I was able to substitute. Pretty good selection of yeast, grain, hops for any home brewer. As well as, any supply needed for the bottling process, or for anyone starting to brew their own beer or wine. Definitely will be returning back this month for more supplies.<//text>< Name>

< Review>
This is a great store with everything you need for home brewing beer, mead, wine, or cider. Ingredients, equipment, everything you need for professional bottling or kegging.

This is a small business. The owner, Greg, is a treasure. He is incredibly knowledgeable and loves sharing that knowledge with others. If it weren't for him, I'd be miles behind in my brewing. He's very kind and and always interesting to talk to.</Review>

<review>I love this place. If you enjoy making your own beer, wine or cider HomeBrew is the place to come and buy your supplies. Greg is so knowledgeable and personable.

If you’re on the fence about getting into Home Brewing come talk to Greg and he will get you excited to about the hobby. He also provides a class each month. I 100% recommend Homebrew Supplies! Cheers 🍺<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><time>1578973184170< /time></record>

<text>I go here primarily to get my CO2 tank filled up. $20 or so, it's a good price.

The selection of malts are wide and it's easily placed out to scoop the amount you need. Hops are kept in a container in a fridge for individual weighing, so I have some concerns about oxidation. Yeast variety is lacking, as they don't seem to carry Imperial or Omega. Hardware is well stocked, though I was surprised to find they had no Intertap accessories. They have a wall of recipes that seem well crafted.

All together, I'll keep coming here for CO2 and when I need a spot or two of things, but not as a primary source.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Absolute LAST time I shop here...it used to be good before the grouchy old man became a permanent fixture. Can't avoid him any longer and he's got the absolute worst attitude. Sad.

good shop that is well stocked.  I live far from here but it is worth the drive. I try to support my local homebrew shops before buying online.  The owner was a wealth of knowledge in helping me with my starter and how to use a pitch rate calculator.<//text>

<text>This place has some random reviews saying that it's pricey or the owner is kinda crabby but all the times I've been here for malt, hops, barley, various supplies or even a new carboy it's been great. The owner knows A LOT about brewing beer, kombucha, coffee and wine and has consistently given advice on how to make my stuff better. Additionally, he knows the best breweries in the area (turned me on to Tortugo -- A+) and can recommend various supplies to get close to certain tastes. His prices are higher than, say, Amazon, but it's not like I'm looking for a pound of Citra if I'm only brewing 10 gallons of an IPA. Sucks it's in Eagle Rock but cool that it exists.<//text>< resp>

Extremely knowledgeable staff or answer all your brewing questions and help you avoid any pitfalls.

<text>Decent selection. The issue is that there is a crotchety older guy that asks you a bunch of questions about your beer and then tells you you don't know what you're doing. I went in to get ingredients for a beer I brew before and he proceeded to tell me that everything I was doing was wrong. he asked me what style of beer I was brewing then told me that was wrong. He asked me what ABV I was shooting for and then told me that was wrong. I can't tell if he's trying to help or just be condescending. I'll probably go elsewhere for my future homebrew needs.</text>< pics>

There ok , stock is ok. Hops are usually yellow, if your a new home Brewer you might not have the best experience. Attitude can be challenging to enjoy your shopping experience. I'd check out other stores before deciding to go to this one.</Review>

What an awesome homebrew supply store. They have everything. All the ingredients in house to build almost any style beer. There is a wall of recipes to look over then start pulling ingredients. Kits are partial grain kits but can be converted to all grain. All the accessories to service kegs, kegerators, brewing accessories, etc. And they have CO2 refills at $3/lb. Will definitely be back.< /review>

They have pretty much any homebrewing supplies you could need, from very basic kits & recipes for first time brewers, to more advanced equipment for more experienced brewers.

The staff is quite knowledgeable, but, as is often the case with specialty stores like this, they aren't always obviously friendly.  They can feel a little standoffish, which can be intimidating, but once you open up conversation with them, they are generally friendly, and VERY helpful.  Don't be intimidated.

You can probably find cheaper prices for most stuff online, but you can't beat instant gratification and one-on-one advice from someone who knows what they're talking about.< /Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>The store is fairly well stocked, but I have had mixed experiences there. I haven't felt very welcome there by a little bit older white guy who seems very put out when you ask questions for things like grain substitutions, for example. He is fairly helpful, to be fair, as long as you go out of your way to apologize for asking what I guess he feels are stupid questions. I've been brewing for a little over a year, so I'm still learning. I will go out of my way in the future to give my business to a store that is much less convenient to go to, since they are friendly and helpful.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Their hours aren't accurate. Closed by 6:30 on a Saturday

Update: I've since had good experiences with this store. However, they do not vacuum seal their hops. I would not buy hops from them until they do.< /Review>< pics>

<review>I only come here because it's close by and open on the weekends. There's a great variety of grain, and beermaking supplies are well stocked. My issue with this place is that it is seriously overpriced. I paid $10 for something that costs me $6 elsewhere. I do it because it's local. If I plan better, I shop elsewhere, and save lots of money. Do yourself a favor and look at other stores, especially if you're close to the West Valley.< /review><Date>1484692049747</Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went there carrying two co2 tanks for my soda machine and before I  took three steps inside the door the  man behind the counter barked at me, "we don't fill those here." I had other questions in addition to whether they filled the tanks but upon being barked at I left immediately.

They definitely lost future business from me. I guess I'll be buying my brewing ingredients and soda supplies elsewhere.< /Text>< Pictures>

Younger fat guy on the weekends just sits behind the register and talks to his brew boy friends. I don't even enter on the weekends if more then six people, I don't have all afternoon to get my supplies.

Never been there, try looking in a mirror.</text>

Great HBS with great selection and great staff. Every time I go, they have exactly what I need and are super helpful.
The prices are a little steeper than online, but honestly, it's worth it to walk into a physical shop and browse, smell the hops before buying, look at the quality of grain, and you CANNOT put a price on the advice from the staff.
When I first started brewing, I spoke to one of the staff (no names), and looking back, I know I sounded like an idiot. Regardless, he was really understanding and set me on the right path.
Recently my daughter came with me and he helped her with her plan to cook root beer, and she got exactly what she needed. That speaks volumes to me about the quality of their service.
I highly recommend them, whether you are a beginner looking for help with recipes, or a pro building a keezer, ERHS has you covered.<//review>

MBA and his team have been working on my personal and business taxes sine 2013. I’m a loyal and a satisfied customer. Don’t just take my word. After a brief discussion, you will see how the team is knowledgeable and proactive. What I like is that I got to understand not only how taxes work but also how to plan ahead of time. For your accounting or tax needs, you can trust Mark and the team at MBA.<//text>

<review>My previous tax preparer was not able to file my taxes on time.

I was in a bind and Mark Naaman, personally, ensured that I got my taxes filed on time. He was very professional and knowledgeable and was able to alleviate all my concerns. This is the best experience I've ever had in my life!

Looking forward to working with Mark and the good folks at MBA Financial & Accounting Solutions next year< /review>< name>

The course that they offered was very detailed, easy to follow and broken into parts that most small business utilize on a daily basis. The support that they have is incredible as it was quick, easy to reach and consistent.  I am looking forward for the next level of training in October.<//Review>< Pictures>

<name>Hollie Forge< /name><Review>MBA Financial and accounting solution (MBAFAS) is one of the most professional tax preparation operations that I've had the fortune of employing. My taxes were filed on time and promptly and Mark did a phenomenal job that I had him look at my previous tax filing and found a mistake in the previous filings.

I've done both my personal and business taxes at MBA financial and honestly, this has been a life changing experience. I came in last year for a consultation after my accountant moved away... and I was not disappointed. I was greeted and treated well, the owner is very friendly and welcoming. The tax preparer told me what I needed to bring in and send in, then it was smooth sailing from there. I encourage everyone to give MBAFAS a chance to win your business.</text>

<text>I've been working with MBA Financial & Accounting Solutions for over a year now, and it's been a pleasure and a blessing to have them maintain the books for my business as well as prepare my personal taxes. MBAFAS is a reliable company with a friendly team who helped me re-structure my business so that everything is running efficiently and properly. After providing them with all the issues, the MBA Team, led by Mark, took the time to explain both the devised plan and the expected outcome. Implementation and transitions were smooth and timely. I'm happy to say that I've made the right choice in choosing this firm to handle my bookkeeping, taxes and re-structuring. Highly Recommended.< /text>< Pictures>

Numbers and financials make me very nervous. I've been working with Bassam, Mark and their team for 5 years now and I can't be more happy with the service. They simplify matters so I can understand them, they are very patient and sometimes they have to draw things out and explain them step by step until I feel comfortable. I started with doing my personal tax return with them and now I have my bookkeeping, payroll, personal and business tax filings and my business sales tax filing done with them. I definitely recommend them.<//review>

It’s refreshing to work with people that take the time to learn about your business and challenge you with their insightful financial skills. Working with MBA financial and accounting services improved my business and with MBA’s guidance I was able to buy a commercial building and further grow our business.

Growing a business is easy, but maintain a overall cash flow forecast, p&l current and sales report when needed requires attention, time and dedication. MBA Financial & Accounting Solutions went above and beyond on those tasks. Business visibility is always there and they are always on top of their tasks. I am glad i chose them for my bookkeeping services. If i have to describe them in 3 words i would have to say: Knowledgeable, Accessible and Organized.<//text>

<review>Honestly, I never write reviews, especially negative ones, but this was the worst experience I’ve ever had at a little caesars. To give reference I know the amount of ingredients that should be on the pizza or the regulations of what is considered cooked since I have worked at LC before, this was awful. The pizza was undercooked completely, the crust was almost pale white, but the worst of all was the cheese bread. Please retrain your employees, it was covered in butter to the point where it would leak from the bottom of the bread. The Italian seasoning was like she poured the entire little cup of it on. Never returning again.<//review>< userid>

I love love love this location, I have been to tons of little caesars in different towns and I can say for sure the Livingston location is by far the absolute best 😊. Everyone is so friendly and it's a sincere friendliness, I never feel like it's some kind of "script" it doesn't matter what time you walk in there it can be during a crazy rush and they are still so friendly, fast and I always leave with a smile on my face. The manager he is great he does an amazing job of training his crew and he's not like other managers he doesn't sit around he's in the mix lending a helping hand, I hope his bosse(s) know this and see this in him😊 keep up the great work guys I'll be back soon❤️</review>

Thought I'd give a try after all these years but couldn't get waited on. The cashier's looked right pass me as if I wasn't standing in plain sight. I'll go back to the overpriced truck stop next door I refuse to beg you to take my $$$$.</text>

<Review>Cashier acknowledged me as soon as I approached the counter. Took my order accurately and was very friendly. My order took about 10 mins which was my estimated time. My deep dish was hot, delicious, & fresh. My crazy bed was as well.

<review>all reviews are almost year old , this place now sucks big time . 3 meat pizza is supposed to be ready , but it never is. the workers are slow and lazy or maybe owner doesnt want to take chances of pizza going to waste. still the little ceaser promise is always ready. last year on superbowl sunday , they showed thier true colors, i mean come on , you know its gonna be busy. these fools were caught by suprise. 15 minutes to get a pizza! all iam saying is , phone and order your pizza before you go there or else you will have to wait.< /review><Rating>3</Rating><user_name>Daddy Driver<//user_name>< user>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I like them because they are always hot and the people who tend the afternoon shift are very nice.

<Rating>1</Rating><time>1605702522725< /time><review>Beautifully rich in scenery and history at both campuses. Some incredible nurses came out of program. Absolutely the worse place to work professionally behind scenes. Employment was several years ago and there are employees good at what they do of course; however easier to find incompetence, favortism and a constant reminder to add looking behind the scenes and office desks when committing to it.< /review>< Name>

Stay away!!!!!!!!
the most horrible experience I ever had when I try to apply to their ABSN .
Try to do a good research before even thinking of this school.
Waste of time and money. Admissions counselor informed me with wrong information for over a year .
When asking her a question, she is always answers I don’t know! Let me ask admissions.
Stay away you will regret !
If there’s less than one star I will put it.</text>

<Review>I attended 6 different colleges & universities in my youth, both public and private, 2-year and 4-year, including the University of California, and NONE of them compared to The Mount. I attended MSMU in my early 30's and got a phenomenal education there. It was so good that I was able to get into graduate school easily. I loved the school so much that I have been teaching there for more than a decade and I will stay forever!</Review>< pictures>

Mount St. Mary's is an amazing school. I transferred into the school from UCLA for undergrad and I had an amazing experience. The class sizes are small and you are able to have more personal connections with professors. I am now working on finishing my Master's in Counseling Psychology and I do not think I could have chosen a better school to finish my undergrad and get my Master's.</Text>

I thought choosing this school was the best decision but it was the WORST choice. Administration sells you on all these great services and in reality no one knows anything or is willing to help you, once you are here. God forbid YOU owe them money. Because they sure are calling, emailing and sending you letters. Exactly like debit collectors and robocalls. And if you get the current Assistant Director of Financial Aid "Jaime Hernandez" to help you with F.A good luck! He's sexist and belittling!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>I'll be graduating on in a few weeks and am really glad that I serendipitously ended up transferring to this school. I went to the Chalon campus which is in Brentwood and it's beautiful there. The history/political science department is phenomenal. The class sizes are small which was really great because students really get to know their professors. I got several scholarships from the school because of my high GPA. Only has one horrific professor there, Laurie Wright Gary, whatever you do avoid her. Aside from that my experience was super!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>I was an online student.  My first few classes were fine, no issues, great instructors, interesting material. But then came my second term and I signed up for a class taught by Dr. Ana Thorne. She is quite overbearing and condescending. I'm a pretty tough guy, but I seriously felt like I was reliving my second grade being bullied years. That's just not how a teacher/student relationship should feel.  What's worse is that no one from the university was there to facilitate for me, so I dropped all of my classes and transferred elsewhere. I was very disappointed because I felt this school had the potential to really be something great for me.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>All this school wants from you is your money!! They use being a "Catholic Private University" to their advantage and make tuition extra higher. The business office never knows the answer to your questions and are constantly screwing you over! They never let you know about financial changes and then you are left with late fees!
I recommend going to a different university where they actually listen to their students and help with tuition!</Text>< username>

<Text>I highly encourage you not to attend this college! I can't even begin to count the amount of issues I've had to endure and my experience has been more frustrating and unenjoyable then it has been good!

To highlight the most recent issue I had.... I received an email last Friday evening, April 1, 2016 stating that I have been PULLED FROM GRADUATION and my tickets are being withheld. To ad to that, the email was sent on a Friday evening at 4pm after the office was already closed so I was unable to speak with anyone. I didn't freak out too much because I knew that I was on track and it was a mistake on their part, but given that it is completely unacceptable for a University to send an email of such magnitude on a Friday evening saying I've been pulled from graduation and I am unable to speak to someone. That is just downright completely stupid and contained a lack of intelligence among the office.

Furthermore I went into the registrars office Monday morning and informed them of the issue. To no surprise they indicated it was an error on their part and I should be cleared fro graduation. 2 girls proceeded to fiddle around, laugh and even sure while trying to enter the correct information to clear me in their system. After about 5 minutes they said I was good to go. The next day I went online to proceed with the graduation steps. I found that I was still NOT on the graduation list and I was unable to reserve my tickets. I went back to the office and told them of the issue and they proceed to say they cleared me but can't fix the issue so I would have to contact someone else. So not only did THEY WRONGLY remove be from graduation they have now made it difficult for me to clear up THEIR MISTAKE.

Additionally, if the school is not already pretty expensive, tuition has increased every single year.
Parking is also terrible, and though we had $400 for a parking permit, we are not guaranteed a parking spot and security is constantly driving around looking to give tickets.

I can't wait to leave this place and May can't come any sooner!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Pardon me, you probably don't have access to the curriculum, I am a transfer student form a community college and the challenge is not what you see on the surface and or within the community, it is what is being delivered and learned within a structured educational function.  Please don't judge a book by it's cover and by the way after Mt St Mary's (the glorified community college) I am headed to Notre Dame.  That's in no form the application of a not necessary informational systematic application.  God Bless<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I had a horrible experience! Firstly, the school is not a real college/university at all. So you are paying a great deal of money to get an average education with none of the perks of going to a real university. You can try to convince yourself it does not matter but at the end of the day when you are paying for your education you want all the great things that should come with it. I was bullied my whole first year and finally was able to transfer. That was absolutely the best decision of my life. The Doheny campus is a glorified community college with dorms. You are seriously better of going to El Camino or Santa Monica College, SERIOUSLY! I cannot speak on the Chalon campus when I did visit it had a better feel to it. However, if you do not get into the Chalon campus and they offer you the Doheny route. Run as fast as you can in the opposite direction! It is basically a glorified scam. I understand that at the end of the day they're a business like any other organization but this truly was one of the biggest waste of money and time ever in my life. They are still ruining my life as I prepare to graduate from my new university. I understand no college is perfect but honestly my experience here in the rural south far out weighs my experience there. What upsets me most is that they prey on those who are first generation and may have had a tough time in high school and give them this glorified view of being the first to go to college and put them in huge amounts of debt when they typically come from a low-income background. Where do they expect them to find this money? I really hope my review saves someone from wasting their time and money.< /Review><rating>2< /rating><pics>None< /pics>< user_name>

You you like it when your needs (medical, mental, etc.) are ignored? Do you just love gourmet meals such as "Apricot Chipotle Roast Beef? How about an administration that cares more about film productions and getting the college turned into a university? Do you like when your school raises tuition and puts your money into building a fountain?
Do you like feeling like a useless waste of space that can never give people enough money? Do you enjoy not having any job opportunities because your chosen major does not have job/internship assistance support?

Then this is the school for you!

Do not be fooled by the great views. While they're nice, i's not worth the turmoil that you'll have to go through. The only reason this place gets even one star is because their art department, ISAE (this office is the only reason I graduated on time,) and work study programs are decent. They also offer quite a bit of scholarship assistance, which seems to be the prime reason so many students go here.

Oh, and by the way, once you graduate you'll be inundated with requests to donate money. I'm pretty sure all colleges do that, but this just seems over the top. Much like many other colleges, you'll need to track your own progress on which classes you need to take. It's very difficult to transfer in and out of this school because classes that they say will transfer never do. Or they'll catch you on the fact that while the number is the same, the class title isn't, and they'll make you retake it.

It's really not worth the money or effort, but I did get out in four years, with the potential to be out in three and a half. It's those required 5 religion/philosophy classes that always get you in the end. That happens to everyone who goes here, and the requirement is a bit overkill.

Apply at your own risk.
You have been warned.

(By the way, Chalon applicants, despite what they tell you, you are only able to leave the hill at 3 different times a day, all in the afternoon. Good luck getting to your jobs unless you can drive. The damn place is like a boarding school. If you want the college experience, this is NOT the place to have it!)

EDIT, one year later, and still a one star review:
I'm STILL unemployed. People laugh at me when they see Mount St. Mary's on my resume, and I've been rejected from a job just because I went there. I have 8 years of formal work experience, and 15+ years of volunteer experience, and I graduated cum laude from the honors program. I've been rejected from clerical jobs because I'm "not qualified enough" for a ground level CLERICAL POSITION and from McDonald's because I'm "overqualified" and they think I don't want to work for minimum wage. I had to move back home because I couldn't afford my rent. I eat once a day. I'd be GRATEFUL for a minimum wage job, and whenever I'm rejected I have to grovel, therefore burning my bridge with that company.
The only chance of me getting a job is by going to another school and getting another degree (which I'm currently trying to do for a computer sciences degree. Heads up that MSMC, excuse me, MSMU only has an online degree for computer sciences, and it's only been there a few years. Same with Communications.)
The Career Services office is still sending out my old resume to companies, which is nice, but I mostly get scams. I just recently got one from an architectural firm. Seeing as it might connect with part of my major, I got excited. Silly me, they just want to illegally funnel money through my bank account.

Going here was the worst decision of my life.
I thought I'd have a job and be getting on with things by now.
I'm sitting at home writing a review, calling up Career Services because I got contacted by another scam, applying for the 128th job this month, and working on things I can post on etsy/ebay just so I can have a bit of money for Christmas.

I thought going to college would get me places in life, and you know, maybe it would have if I'd gone to a different school.< /Review>< gmapID>

I loved the cozy feeling, including the paper plates and plastic silverware, as it felt like a picnic after a swim. I got the #1 with no sausage and it was delicious, and really big! Was a nice place to visit while here in CA for a bit.</Text>

Great food. Love it. Big breakfast is bomb. Service good.

My only complaint is it would be nice to see something aside from single use plastics being served to customers dining in!! Come on pipes let’s change that!<//Text>

So so surfer spot. The breakfast is decent but it's just scrambles. Meaning: let's just take these ingredients and throw them into a frying pan until they look edible....
But if you're a surfer dude or gal, it's great for a quick protein pickup!</review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>It was a beautiful morning in San Clemente.  My myself and 2 children woke up excited to begin our camping trip and we decided to patronize a local restaurant as newcomers to start off our day.  We found a local restaurant with our favorite, pancakes.  We walk in and are greeted with an unwelcoming stare from the woman behind the counter.  I shift in slight discomfort, but figure it's still pretty early in the morning and maybe people haven't had their coffee yet 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️.  I look over the menu on the wall and find what we are looking for, pancakes!  I order our pancakes and a few sides, all with a single word not spoken to myself or 2 children, beyond the cheese upsell on the potatoes and a head shake no when asked if the potatoes were hashbrowns.  I ask for water and am pointed to an orange cooler on a table.  We sit down and wait for our food.  My son got up from the table to get us all water and was met with glares from the few other patrons in the restaurant.  We were served our food which was the most disappointing meal I've had thus far in my life.  The pancakes were completely flavorless and soggy.  The potatoes were also soggy and grease filled.  My children ate a few bites and asked me if they had to eat it all.  I shook my head no.  While sitting there the entire time, I observed at least 4 families come in after us greeted with warm hellos and excellent, attentive customer service.  We threw away our plates and as we left, I felt a feeling that I hadn't felt since I walked into a small town Mississippi restaurant in my college days.  As we were walking to the car, my son stopped me and asked me why we made everyone so uncomfortable when we came in and why they stared at us like that.  I told my son, that if a person or business cannot treat them right or makes them feel uncomfortable, he doesn't have to go there or be near that person.  So we vowed to never go back.  We continued on our day and proceeded to have the best camping trip ever.  My advice would be to buy a portable stove, and make some breakfast yourself!  #Neveragain<//review><time>1583648340504<//time></record></dataset><record>

This place is a legend on the golden coast. I got a breakfast burrito for roughly $9 but honestly was left a little unsatisfied. It is awesome though to see the locals stroll in and also enjoy a seaside restaurant.<//text>

Came in on my lunch break and ordered my food to go. I sat for over 20 minutes then decided I needed to check on my order. It had not even been started. Terrible service. Don't go here if you have a short lunch break.< /Text>

Love their breakfast burritos! I am not an egg fan, so I asked for no eggs and the cashier asked if I would like to substitute potatoes. Wonderful idea, as it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had!< /review>

Stopped in for a quick breakfast. Great  size breakfast burrito! Splitting one satisfied me and my husband. Couldn't help myself and got a fresh baked muffin for the road. Surfing videos played on the tv and chill music while we ate.< /Text>

Food was barely sub-par at best. Combo platter "fried potatoes" and scrambled eggs were dry and bland.  I really shouldn't have expected much with a place that serves their meals on paper plates and plasticware.< /review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Great food and relatively cheap; however, the girls who work at the counter seem awfully aloof. I understand, it's a minimum wage gig with probably underwhelming tips, but it would go a long way if they could provide a modicum of customer service and wipe the perpetual RBF from their face. Maybe that's asking too much.
Also, I work locally, so it's nice to call in an order ahead of time to maximize my half hour of allotted time for lunch. I've attempted calling this place on several occasions to eventually give up because no one answers the phone. It's hard to give my money to a place that ignores a ringing phone! (Since it takes them forever to just make a simple, albeit good, breakfast burrito.)
I give them three stars for the food and zero stars for their customer service.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcf45952b19ac1:0x64726462e9b69437<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>I've been to the Cardiff location and it served great warm food on a chilly beach morning. But it was just OK here in San Clemente. Big portions of just so-so food.<//Review>< user_id>

Never actually received services here, we could not connect on a time.  Communication is key here.  Wanted a couples massage but when we showed up only one person was available. The place looked very clean and they did try to reschedule so I imagine this place is very good, great reviews, anxious to serve.  Just be very clear about what is needed and when.  Hope to use them in the future.</review>

<Review>Hot stone, deep tissue, and scraping for $60 full hour. Fit me in as a walk-in.  The best massage, worked hard to get out knots. I’d go every week if I lived there.<//Review>< username>

This place is a very good place to get a massage. Not like other massage places. I payed for full body massage and also the hot stones. It was very worth it. Not rushed service. Very kind people. I will be coming again when I need a massage to loosen up my body.<//text>

This place is a hidden gem. Cindy knows how to give an excellent massage. She has a lot of massage experience and you will feel it. Unfortunately, it is hard to find this location haha. The sign is worn a bit and the door is locked until your appointment when you call and then someone will unlock it [if your appointment is later in the day]. The location vibe is a lil sketchy and can be uncomfortable at first but the massage makes up for it and the professionalism is on-point.< /Text>

Incredibly reasonably priced massages. Their deep tissue massages are my favorite. Place is clean, no frills but you can't beat the prices.<//text>

< Review>
Decent massage by Cindy who I believe runs the place. She was taking calls or stepping out to welcome customers through out the session. At the end was expecting a minimum 20% tip; not sure if it is a SFO thing.

Should have read other reviews about poor customer service and 20% min tip.</Review>

Even though we had to wait a while after our scheduled appointment, the massage and facial were amazing for the price! The masseuses were firm so I wasn't too ticklish like I usually am and they really got into any knots. Be patient and you'll get a great massage.</text>

I have no idea how this can exist in a city where coffee is $5, but if you go there and like them, definitely come back and write a review, so they can continue to exist.

Also they can validate your parking, so double awesome.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Firstly, you have to expect that you get what you pay for. You can't expect ultimate spa treatment as you would at some fancy hotel spa, for example. For the price, this was an amazing massage experience. Knots were kneaded out that I didn't even know existed. The staff doesn't seem to speak English very well, but I didn't find that to be a problem. ... They also gave me a banana, haha.< /Review>< Pictures>

Very friendly owner who genuinely cares about her customers. The staff was very welcoming and professional, our party of two was very satisfied with the quality of the massage and feel that our hour massage was well worth the price. I highly recommend this place as I felt the quality of service well exceeds the $45 for an hour!<//Review>

<text>AVOID!!! Average massage which can be had at other establishments in the area for much less. Management FORCES you to pay a minimum of 20% tip. This is not shared anywhere on the menu.  Scammers and I would avoid - they could be scamming your credit card info/charges too.< /text><UserId.>102516239325484731504<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I have never gotten a massage before, but I injured my back at work and have had a lot of pain.  The massage was kinda rough but I had 80% relief of my pain the next day, I'll definitely go back when the pain gets bad again<//text>

The place is clean and small, well priced too. But you get what you pay for. My masseuse had a very poor technique, I had to say three times that I needed less pressure because I was getting hurt. (I usually ask for more pressure with other masseuses). I'm sorry, but my experience was less than relaxing.<//Review>

I tried to give this place another chance after not coming here in 2 years. I only get dip powder, and I cut my nails short at the start of this year and have been growing them out so I was pretty happy with how long my nails have gotten. The woman cut my nails all the way down and I tried to tell her as soon as she started and she kept saying “later” as if she was going to fix them. It was really taking a whole lot for me to not get up and leave, she didn’t want to listen about cutting my nails so short so I didn’t think she was going to listen about everything else she was doing wrong. My nails came out slanted and bubbly. Not only that there were so many flies everywhere.<//Review>

<review>I have been getting my nails done on and off for 44 year's and this is the first time I can recall ever not being happy with them. They are not even on straight. Im not going to be able to have them filled. I will have to get a whole new set.</review><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

Staff was really nice and reasonable however the nails I got done getting have all fallen off over the course of about a week, keep in mind im not very harsh with my nails either, and I had to wait about 45 minutes after the appointment I made, and they were very harsh with the filing. Chemicals burnt my fingers a little as well, they did give me a hot towel to put my hands in after, but they stung for a while.</text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Luxury nails is not so Luxury,  I wanted an acrylic set. I picked out the colors, I wanted white with sparks. But got white with silver sparkles, they left acrylic all over my fingers painted them uneven.

I hated the color so much I went to Vip nails for a color change. They even out the uneven nails and did exactly what I wanted. I guess I should have gone there in the first place.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I called ahead of time to plan on getting a $45 dollar manicure. Nothing crazy. I go there to get them done, and they place a design on the nails that I did not ask for, and then charged me $71 dollars for the manicure. I was pretty upset, but I was kind when I simply vocalized to the woman, asking why the price jumped up so high, since I was informed it was $71 dollars. She said “for the design, I charged you for the design”. I did pay it anyways since I’m shy and don’t really know how to speak up, but all the nails ended up falling off within a week. So not only did I pay 71 dollars, they didn’t even last till I could afford a fill. Very dissatisfied. And I’ve never had to write a bad review before. The nails were not even either.</review><username>Sade Raquel< /username><gmapID>0x80c16ccad0a1b181:0x9a130c03d594b577</gmapID>< Rate>

< review>
Took my granddaughter in to get a set of nails I don't know if it's a language barrier but they are nothing like what she ask for, we  and we didn't dare say anything because before she was done the lady next to her who we heard tell her beautician three times that she was doing her nails wrong she wanted round and not pointed the owner came over and started yelling at the lady and made her cry it was an awful experience and we will absolutely never ever go back. And my granddaughters nails have big lumps and you can feel the glitter through the top coat.</review>

First time going there and the service I received was great. I went for a basic mani/pedi. Considering the amount of people that were there already I was surprised at how quickly I was serviced, with no cutting corners, nor feeling rushed. I would definitely come here again.< /text>

Horrible customer service! Would not recommend, I made an appointment for 5:30 for a pedi and a new set and it was 7:00 pm and I still had not received service for my nails. Ultimately, had to leave due to prior engagement without my nails even being done. Workers did not come to check on me besides the one time and the other the guy simply told me that i should be using the cotton ball to remove my acrylic while I waited. Highly disappointing and this was not my first TERRIBLE encounter. Will NOT be visiting Luxury again, I will travel out of town before allowing them to service me.</Text>

Went in last week and did the organic mani and pedi, paid $115.00 total for services and my gel polish peeled off over the weekend. The ladies I had were amazing, nice and accommodating but unfortunately I feel they are not using top quality product. I thought I would be going back because of the great customer service, now I know the quality of their gel paint so will have to find another location to be pampered 🙄<//review>

I was visiting from out of town and needed a manicure. The service was wonderful, fast and the gel manicure has lasted a full 3 weeks without chipping or lifting. I’ve spent the last few week moving and doing a lot of cleaning and packing, so I couldn’t be any happier.< /review>

<review>The lady that did my pedicure was rude. They use really hard pumice stone like sponges; she hit the side of my foot taking skins off and acted like I was a wimp for jumping when it hurt. She kept digging her nails into the sides of my nail in a very painful way. Very disappointed. Only plus side is okay prices compared to the salon's in town.<//review><Time>1558993168753</Time><Rating>1<//Rating>< userid>

The first time I visited this shop the man who did my nails was amazing!!! He took his time, paid attention to detail, was patient and did exactly what I had asked. I received so many compliments from people. This last time I went in, I got a different man. This guy didn't listen to what I asked for, he watched football instead of paying attention to his work. He rushed through the process and did such a sloppy job. He didn't shape my nails, and he left paint all around my fingers. I got to my car and was completely upset. I went back in to see if they could at least make them look decent and clean them up some. Kelly helped fix them but I got nothing but hostile attitude from the man who ruined my nails in the first place.The man argued and slammed things down on the table. Then talked about me and made me feel so unwelcomed. I will probably not go back because of how I was treated by him. I give this place 2 stars because there are good techs there. But it looks like it might be left to chance or convince when you visit.</Text>

I absolutely love this place! From hospitality and cleanliness to the finish product. I’ve never walked out of this place feeling like I didn’t get exactly what I wanted. Oooh and let me not forget my favorite part, the deluxe pedicures with fresh fruit and amazing products. The pedicures make you feel like your on the beach in Hawaii even though we are in little ol Ridgecrest.
Ill recommend this place 100 times over.</text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>BEST nail salon in Ridgecrest HANDS DOWN!!!

Okay so, I recently relocated out here because like most who come to the high desert, my husband is stationed on the China Lake military base.
Starting new all over, I set out on a MONTH LONG hunt for THE BEST OF THE BEST nail & hair enthusiasts in town. This included reading EVERY (and I mean EVERY SINGLE REVIEW) of nail/hair salons in this location.

Yesterday, was the VX9 Vampire Christmas party AND also, my first day at my new job! To honor these two special occasions, I really had my heart set on getting a fresh full acrylic mani! Still having yet to try out any salons post my review readings, I remembered luxury nails had some of the best reviews and most lovely pictures!
So, I took a leap of FAITH & set up an appointment an hour before I was scheduled to go in for training for my new job! and...

OH MY GOODNESS! THANK JESUS FOR THE ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER THAT GUIDED ME TO TAKE THAT LEAP!  I got there and NO JOKE, within 10 mins OR LESS I was in a chair being worked on! The BEST PART, for THE FIRST TIME in my whole life & experience with getting my nails done, NOT ONE PERSON urged me to change my mind of color, design, or shape!! NOT ONE person made me feel unwelcome or like their interests were solely driven by money.

I usually don't write reviews but what luxury nails did for me yesterday was beyond some of the most caring & courteous behavior I have EVER experienced at a nail salon. I was going to be a few minutes late on my FIRST DAY on the job because I made the mistake of not scheduling more ahead (The manicurist who worked on me was VERY thorough and dedicated to giving me the exact look I wanted, which of course lets be honest ladies, takes time!) . My husband paid & I expressed my concern about being a tad late & my manicurist so generously offered to let me come back anytime before closing or even the proceeding day so that they could finish! They were NOT about to let me be walking around with half ass looking nails and that to me, TRULY means something! That told me instantly, these people take PRIDE in their work! I came back after training & they were super caring & expressed genuine concern for how my day went & if I got there on a decently timely manner.

EVERYONE loved my nails at the Christmas party & I have not stopped receiving compliments ever since! I even got a complement just earlier today at Walmart & what I found AMAZING was the woman who complemented me INSTANTLY KNEW I had got them done at Luxury Nails! NEEDLESS TO SAY, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND & I think, wait, NO I KNOW, I've found my new spot! <3</text></record></dataset><record>

Cashier was nice but woman preparing the food was rude and did not give us any salsa. She spoke to use rudely and even though she saw us waiting to ask her for sauce she ignored us. She was wearing a head piece so probably a manager or supervisor. Also did not give us the chicken for a our salads. Never returning.< /review>

Sub par service at the window and the cheese on my salad when i asked for no cheese to begin with, not cool. No greeting, no hello, no smile. All the basics of customer service was not taught to the girl at the window. First thing out of her mouth was "do you need a cup holder?" with a very serious look- a not so friendly look. As for the cheese found on my salads, 4 tostada salads, $35 later, some cheese found on them. Not happy. Not everyone loves cheese.. 2nd time giving this Pollo Loco the benefit of the doubt, but after this I'll start driving to the new location on Avalon.< /Text>

When we went to buy food at this location on the register there was a lot of small cockroaches running all over the counter. The chicken was so burn like ashes and dry it felt is some other day chicken. This location is not sanitary at all and not great service.
What a let down.</Text>

Family meal: Cold, 3 red salsas and 2 green for this meal not enough.
No napkis or utensils in the order.
It was a hassle because I wasn't going home to eat.  I will think twice again to buy at this location.< /review>

There is always something wrong. This is the closest location I been there only 2 times. The 1st time they make me wait 10 minutes to exchange the tortillas because the ones they give me with my order were cold. The second time I waited 25 minutes for my order. Isn't this place a fast food restaurant. 🤬< /review>

< Review>
I ordered the $5 Taco combo with chips and a drink. And one leg. For here. My receipt had Avocado tacos and no leg was on the receipt.  My order was called. They had it to go. The tacos were the wrong ones. I told the lady.  But i said ok I won't trip I'll just eat it. So I unwrap the tacos avocados were Brown. I took it back. So they redo my order. This time it was the platter.  Which I didn't want. I said what about my chicken leg. The lady said I'll bring it to your table. That never happened. Only thing that was right was my drink. And that is because I got it myself. I won't ever come back again.  I am going to let her know she forgot to bring my leg to the table... terrible customer service. She probably wanted me to forget about the leg...<//Review>

I ordered a family meal with flour tortillas, salsa, creamy cilantro, and two churros. I got the family meal and checked my food. Flour tortillas were corn tortillas so I asked for the exchange and reminded them about the salsa and sauce. I got the tortillas and the sauce, no salsa. I asked for the salsa and got the salsa. 5min I spent at the window only to come home and realize they didn't put in the churros and the chicken was burnt. I tried calling immediately after I realized and the phone just kept ringing...twice I called, no response or message machine.< /Review>

Well El pollo Loco is always tops ... Not because I'm Hispanic but
Because they do a fine job always.(standard procedure) and although some stablishments are doing now the beny Hana on their pcs. So it looks more..... Chop chop and then more chop chop.... Instead of having healthy whole pcs.
Which is the way our parents and grandparents and great grandparents have always served them in plates so colorfull with the beans and rice and nic nocs and what not...( Treamins the Latino awesome way) for I'm traditional (to the bone) and it dilutes the traditional way ..by which is I shall say the cornerstone of Mex. Tradition and I think it's scandlees chip and a lame trick to make u think is more so therefore they raise the price cose wow you get more which u don't.
And I say stop chopping the essence of the delicious sinaloense tradition...... People..... It's not orange chicken or terillaky chiken it's darn pollo asado Al estilo sinaloa.
Get it
Got it (???)
Good...ok!
And it's not the first time it comes to my attention ok ... There it is.....see the whole chacha with sinaloense chicken is to grab the fingirliking darn pollo with your own deditos is just that .... It's a darn tradition get it through your diluted production way of doing things.. and people it is pollo the mex. Original f'g recepy not done by henrry Ford.which I could say he developed the production on line ..
Thanks for your consideration and patience .<//review>

This place is not as fast, the chicken is always burn and not juicy
Always missing item and the salsa bar is always messy and low on salsa
They take for ever to hand out your order I feels like hours until you have your order . Customer always leaving or asking for there refund because of how much time they have to wait .
Better to find a different location where there service is at point .< /review>

Wost Pollo Loco ever!! Really bad service. I have been here more than 3 times, and every time I'm here they either mess up my order or I have to wait for more than 20 mins.. Employees don't know the menu at all. Lobby is always dirty, trash everywhere🤢.. I tried to give them a chance, but management sucks I suppose. Plus they put too much rice on bowls; They need more chicken.</text>

Went there for lunch with a friend and we both ordered a Tostada Salad (to go). She ordered the one with shrimp. We specifically told the cashier about my shrimp allergy so that they be careful when preparing our food. They called our number (28 minutes later), we picked up our food, and on our way back to the car we decided to check the bag. BOTH Tostadas had shrimp. Someone must have wanted to send me to the Hospital.</text>

They need to go outside with a rag and some cleaning liquid and clean it!  I would guess that it has never been cleaned since the building was built. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER!  They always get it wrong and if you ask for extra sauce, the workers there act like the cost of the sauce is coming right out of their own pockets. It takes two workers and a supervisor to issue a refund and it is done with great hesitation and resistance. The driver through worker there will accuse you of ordering the wrong thing if they make an error with your order.  The owner of this location should really invest in some employee training!< /Review><username>Tony C<//username></record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I work in the area - love Pollo Loco in general - but this location's drive thru experience is horrible. Three times I have gotten my order wrong. Asked for Taco Salad, no rice 3 times and cashier repeated it - I got rice. Other times, I ask for their red house salsa and cilantro - I got avocado salsa and the pepita cilantro dressing, etc.  To actually get my order right - I need to walk in and get my own condiments apparently. Plus the chicken is really dry and overcooked and small portions on the two piece - the chicken are tiny! Maybe overcooked? I don't know - but I will stick with Pollo Loco in Carson thank you.< /Review>< Pics>

For not being very busy they sure are very slow. Customer service isn't the best. I asked for chicken on the side not on my salad. The cashier got it right but the food prep didn't. I also got a cap from the sour cream on my salad.< /review>

Try it and compare by weight a complete chicken of the crazy chicken and a roast chicken of any super and you will see that they are paying more than double

(Translated by Google) In a disorganized place you have to wait a long time for the dirty bathroom door to open, your food orders are given with 10 or 15 minutes apart, it does not have covers for the probe bases etc.

Lugar desorganizado tienes que esperar mucho para que te abra la puerta del baño sucios, tus órdenes de comida de las dan con 10 o 15 minutos separadas,no tiene tapaderas para los basos de las sondas etc...< /Review>
